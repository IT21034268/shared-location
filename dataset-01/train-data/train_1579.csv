2,Mildly amusing,"Cynthia Kaplan is a talented writer, but she's nowhere close to being ""the female David Sedaris."" Her writing style is nice, and her essay on her grandmother's Alzheimner's is beautiful. Mostly, though, she is too self-conscious and whiny to be funny. You don't have to be completely comfy with all your flaws to be funny about them, but you do have to be honest. The way Kaplan pokes fun at herself seems false, because it's clear that at the end of the day she still wants the reader to think of her as the cleverest girl in class."
2,the book started out really strong...,"the book started out really strong. stories (vignettes/chapters/whatever) about her childhood and crap that happened to her. not like, abuse, but seeing a fat girl at summer camp receive head--stuff like that.and then it degenerated into a mommy blog.i can't get pregnant. blah infertility. blah we're pregnant. blah we went on vacation and my son doesn't love the boob. blah he loves it again.frankly, i don't care.interspersed with the baby crap, there were some stories about her grandma and her alzheimers. those were good.i could have done with a lot more grandma stories or childhood stories and a lot less about pregnancy and having a kid.the stuff that wasn't baby related was really good though."
2,More blog than book,"A female version of the talented Sedaris? Not so much. This book is more like an edited blog entry than a masterpiece of a memoir.If you are as numb to everyday eccentricities as I am, you'll find this book boring and ordinary."
2,Mildly amusing,"This book is a solid 2 stars. Mildly amusing and no more. I can recall one laugh-out-loud moment. Frankly, I've been starved for a really good book. I picked up four from the library, based on reviews I've read here. I hope one or two of the others are better. I hate wasting my valuable reading time on such mediocre material.The theme of this book is ""poor me"" by a self-absorbed rich kid who was given everything in the world, and had a few upsetting moments, with which she filled this book. Save time and read the inside jacket cover only - all the best material is there, and there isn't any more. You can be done with it in 5 minutes."
2,Not So Funny,"The back cover of the book boasts: ""Knee-slapping hilarious."" Eh. Not so much. I generally enjoy how some good writers can make even the mundane funny (David Sedaris comes to mind). But just because you think you're funny doesn't mean you should write. To be fair, there are some enjoyable essays here (particularly ""The Good Swimmer Or How I Lost Him""), but the bulk are just collections of stuff that would be more suitable on a mildly funny blog, not in a book."
2,Horrible Representation of History,"I had to pick a book to do for History. I read this book and it seemed okay. Then I sat and thought about how it was so against men. How it showed men being the accusers more than women, when in fact, it was almost the opposite. I don't recommend this book to anyone. It gives you somewhat of an overview as to what took place during the witch trials in Europe, but take it serioulsy. The facts are seriously distorted."
1,More Revisionism.,"Most historians have soundly rejected Barstow's theories and methods (in fact, I know a professor who uses one of her books as an example of poor scholarship). Like so many authors today, she simply ignores any evidence which might contradict her viewpoint while ""creatively"" interpreting the rest."
2,"Repetitive, repetitive","I, as did others, have a non-academic interest in the witch hunts, and although I have no opinion on whether or not her data is valid, I found that she repeated the same points and examples throughout all the chapters. I couldn't even finish the book because I had felt that I probably read all the new information and that there wasn't much new to add.Fortunatly, I picked up the book cheaply and didn't have to use it for a class. I think that the idea was appealing, but the execution of the work fell very short."
3,Interesting but highly biased,"This was an interesting book and definitely got me started down the whole path of researching the european witch hunts. However, this is a highly feminist work and because of that, Anne Barstow comes across a little biased at times. Yes, women were the ones mainly persecuted but she completely ignores the fact that men were also the ones accused. It is still a decent read but keep in mind the author is a little biased."
4,witchcraze: being a witch sucks,This book enlightens the truth and scandle of witchcraft accusations. It's a really good book about the issues women faced.
3,Of slapstick and bare essentials,"Some ten or twelve years ago I saw A FINE MESS at the movies and laughed a lot. Give it a try. Director Blake Edwards reaches for the slapstick ring he grabbed with his PINK PANTHER movies in A FINE MESS and many of the jokes succeed. Actor Ted Danson's character reminded me of the bumbling ladies man he played on the TV show ""Cheers"" and he's just as funny here. It would seem that the wardrobe budget was cut for actress Julianne Phillips' role."
4,"""Good 80's Comedy!""","Ted Danson and Howie Mandel star in this 1986 comedy.Two pals are chased by the mob while trying to makequick loot. I've always enjoyed this film and Ted andHowie are good together. This dvd has nice pictureand sound, but no extras. I recommend this good80's comedy."
3,It was better the first time I saw it,"Some movies are funnier in memory than on second viewing, aren't they?Still an enjoyable movie though!"
3,Quality but costly,Bought 2 of these for my grandsons. They love them and play with them daily. But I saw the same item at walmart for 1/2 the price.
4,Cover mistake,"This is an excellent edition of the debates, and receives four instead of five stars only because the cover contains an embarrassing mistake. It depicts John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, and Benjamin Franklin editing a draft of the Declaration of Independence: an event that occurred eleven years before the Constitutional Convention. In fact, Thomas Jefferson and John Adams were in Europe at the time of the Constitutional Convention.The publisher has not responded to efforts to change the cover."
5,TRACK LIST,"The Patrick Nelson Collective / Mistletoe MemoriesYear: 1994Track Title1. God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen2. Hark! the Herald Angels Sing3. Joy to the World4. We Three Kings of Orient Are5. Silent Night6. O Come All Ye Faithful7. Holy Ivy8. O Come, O Come Emmanuel9. What Child Is This?10. Deck the Halls11. O Holy Night"
5,MAKE THIS BOOK PART OF YOUR LIFE,"Dave Pelzer is a winner, plain and simple. He not only survived a horrendous boyhood, he learned the gifts of compassion and forgiveness. This book does not revisit the abusive wasteland of his boyhood. Instead, he tackles relevant issues such as spousal and business relationships as well as the art of communication. Dave Pelzer is clearly a master communicator and he has used his experience, knowledge and plain common sense as teaching tools to enrich and reshape the lives of others.Great job. This is a book that will inspire hope and make one feel more optimistic about life in general. I can't recommend it highly enough. The world needs more like Dave Pelzer."
4,Self-Help Psych Book,"When I met Dave Pelzer a few years ago, you could see the chips still in his teeth from his head being slammed against the counter. He showed off pictures of his wife Martha and his son Stephen. Also in his wallet, his father's badge, which choked him up as he talked about it. He was also doing a book-signing for ""Help Yourself"".Considering Dave Pelzer was the author, I thought that this book would be along the lines of his previous 3, maybe a new installment in his life, but it is a self-help book, which was a bit disappointing. This book has some very good advice.If you expect the typical Dave Pelzer story writing, you will be disappointed with this book. If you are looking for a self-help book on your mental attitude and resilience of the human spirit, you should read this book."
2,I LOVED THE FIRST 3 BOOKS BUT:,"BUT THIS ONE WAS SO BLAH, BLAH, BLAH.............HE'S NO TONY ROBBINS, YET I'VE LOVE TO GO SEE HIM IN PERSON........DON'T WORRY BE HAPPY........EVEN IN THE WORSE SET"
2,"Minimizing Effects of Abuse, never a positive twist!","ALthough I have enjoyed all of David Pelzer's other books, in this book he appears to take a leap that has no landing place. He would have us believe that he would not change a thing about his childhood, his failed first marriage, and his struggles with becoming the man he wanted to be. The book lacks a good flow of ideas and has a choppy transitional style. At the end of each chapter he offers a list of ""to do"" items that are sincere, but most often not possible for an individual embroiled in a troubled lifestyle or family. If it truly were ""that easy"" no one would commit homicide or suicide. I have nothing but praise for David Pelzer, he has overcome amazing odds, and in that way has truly been blessed. However, this book appears to be nothing more than an attempt to publish another book. Certainly a step down from his previous work."
4,A Smithsonian Devotee's Feast,"September 28, 2004This book presents a historical, worldwide perspective of many of the international aspects of the Smithsonian's origin and evolving activities. Written by a Smithsonian acolyte who is both a longtime Smithsonian aficionado (as am I) and a practicing journalist, the individual chapters, which describe many of the institution's activities and exhibits, are supplemented with relevant and often revealing quotations, historical anecdotes and well documented photographs.The subject matter, which could be considered as a bit ""dry"" to present, is handled in a manner that will certainly be both entertaining and enlightening to many of the Smithsonian's 25 million annual visitors. My only reservation relates to the author's rather ""singular"" description of the Smithsonian's role in the distribution of early scientific papers, as though there were no other distribution channels available in the 1800's."
5,most natural padded bra,"I have yet to find a more natural looking and comfortable padded bra, despite what other bras promise. It's even totally seamless under a white t-shirt."
5,Works Like a Charm!,"Even for a first timer, this inlay kit worked flawlessly as advertised. Using just basic router skills, it couldn't be much simpler. Put the bit and the guide bushing in the router, trace the template to cut the receiving hole, add the spacer to trace out the inlay with the same template, cut the inlay piece free from the stock, and place it in the complimenting cutout hole. Some sanding may be required to make everything flush, and a practice run is always a good idea.This is a high quality brass set that worked like a charm for me on my first try."
1,DORKA DARKA DARKA THE EXPLORER,"GOOD JOB DORA. AT LEAST YOUR BETTER THAN GIRL AUTHORITY OR AS I CALL THEM THE GIRL LOSERS. THOSE GIRLS SUCK!!!!!!!!!!!! aLL OF THE COOL PEEPS THINK YOUR WAY BETTE THAN GIRL AUTHORITY! IN THE NAME OF GIRLHOOD YOU ROCK, dorka!!!!!"
5,"My daughter says, ""I love it!"" and so do I!",Straight from the source!My two year old loves this CD. Great at keeping her busy without TV! It's adorable and has lots of music preschool children will enjoy. Recommended.
1,Save your money.,"Horrible screeching voice of ""Dora"" throughout every song--My kids couldn't stand it. Every song is bubblegum-popped and ruined, not enjoyable in the slightest. Recommend the original Dora the Explorer CD instead."
3,not what i was expecting,this product is a bunch of disco music sung by dora. i was expecting more music from the show.
3,IS THIS A JOKE?!,"This set is totally messed up! Don't bother with the other reviews, this is one is spoken by a true HP fanatic! First off, Voldemort's head on the box is white, but in the box, his head is actually a murky, see through, glow in the dark colored head! And Peter Petigrew is not even worth building. He is dang ugly! Let's see, Lucius's hair falls off easily, the grey robes don't bend to cover the back and the front of the minifig, it just stands up like an ugly neckpiece of grey cloth! Harry's face on the box is the regular, generic, Harry Potter Minifig face. But the actual head, like Voldemort, is different. It is a pale face with Harry looking really dopey and drunk. I was actually really dissapointed with this set.The only good thing about this is the Grim Reaper, which doesn't have legs. But you can just use Harry's black legs for that. And if you really want to build the drunk Harry, just give him Peter's legs. And don't even get me started on the wands."
5,Bee propolis for sinus allergys.,Works great for my nasal allergys and at a fair price. I have trouble finding this product in stores. I recommend this product for sinus allergys..
4,THE RISE AND FALL OF A JAMAICAN DON,I THINK HE DID A GOOD JOB AS A FIRST TIME WRITER. THE STYLE HE USED MADE THE STORY REAL IN A WAY THAT I COULD SEE THE MAN RUNNING...THE BODIES IN THE MEAT SHOP...BLADE IN THE COFFIN...THE RESTURANT...IT WAS JUST A GOOD STORY.I WOULD DEFINATE;Y BE GOING TO THAT MOVIE GOOD LUCK TO THE AUTHOR
1,"very nonsensical, and misleading. i need a refund","not well writte. it is extremely basic, and lacklustre. the title does not befit its content. utter waste of my money"
5,Ballroom,Looking for a CD of Ballroom and it just 'POPPED' upHaven't played it yet but I had heard it before as an LP
2,One extra star for Dorothy Loudon... otherwise...,"Hard to believe that this unengaging and listless-sounding show was choreographed by Michael Bennett. Maybe it plays better than it sounds. The music is, for the most part, banal--an average evening of ballroom dancing on TV has far more musical life to it--and the pedestrian orchestrations and lyrics don't help. Vincent Gardenia (Little Shop of Horrors OOBC) gets only one song, and Bernie Knee sounds like a lounge singer. What a shame that the classy and talented Loudon got stuck in so many bombs like this one."
4,"""THE grabbing hand"" by ""A grabbing hand""","An excellent work by an unusual economist. Shleifer has made assaults on government intervention in the market a theme of his life's work. He called it ""depoliticization"" in russia. Pity about the title though. Shleifer settled with the US government after the insider trading charges against him and his sidekick Jonathan Hay were proved in a US court. Grabbing hands writing about grabbing hands. How ironic."
1,Loved the paperback; the Kindle edition is pretty bad . . .,"This is one of my favorite Star Trek novels. I was hoping to build up a collection on my Kindle, as it's so much more convenient. This particular title is terribly formatted and makes me want to run and find the old, faithful paperback in a box somewhere. Missing quotation marks, numerous sentences cut off, missing punctuation, words running together, italics font every which way. It's a good thing I already have had the pleasure of reading the story as it should be. If a new reader got the Kindle edition, he/she would be lost! *sad face*"
3,Typical Enterprise vs. superweapon novel.,"Using the Saavik character as the hook, this novel brings us the same story that many Star Trek novels have: overcome the superweapon and save the Federation. At least they didn't proclaim the salvation of the Galaxy or the entire Universe in this one.An entertaining enough novel for the Star Trek fan."
2,More info would help,"I bought this for a train crossing sign project in my son's room. The crossing lights were LED, so they didn't take much power, this thing draws over 15 amps (180Watts) when cycled. Now I am scratching my head on how to salvage the project without adding a huge expensive power supply."
1,NO Ding Dong,"Very disapointed. The Bell is listed as a Ding Dong. I belived I was getting a copy of the old bermuda bell. However when I installed it the bell only went Ding.I called the company and they admit that they misrepresented it.They told me to send it back for a refund. However, after paying to have it installed and the price of it...I'll live with it for awhile.However, I suggest that you don't trust Wolo. I've heard their other horns don't meet up with much approval."
1,Not for real-world use,"When they say don't run this for more than 3 seconds at a time, they mean it. I had it burned up within 10 minutes of installing. Used a toggle switch and turn signal flasher to pulse the bell since its soleinoid only gives the bell a single strike. Continuous use of say 30 seconds as you would want in a city to warn people will not work with this bell or you will fry it. Way too cheap for any automotive application. Why didn't the manufacturer address this cycle time and the pulsing issue when they built the unit? I would not purchase another."
5,5-Star Motivational Series,"This is one of the best motivational tools I have ever come across. The applicability of the messages are incredible, and the inclusion of some of the greatest football minds in the World enables the messages to be driven home with great effectiveness. This is a fantastic product that will make a great gift for the Holidays. A must see for anyone looking for motivation, both football fans and non-football fans alike. I only hope there are more DVDs of this type planned for the future!"
4,Faith,"Daryl Larsen is determined that her soul mate is coming for her, but she just doesn't know when or where but she does know that she has to keep it positive and she ahs to be prepared for him her family and friends worry but she feels as if she knows herself well enough to trust herself with her decisions.Sheldon Turner is an ex-NBA player who retired to take care of his mother and make amends with his brother. With the persona of hit `em and leave em walking before him he knows he can have anyone but he just didn't want anyone.Sheldon & Daryl go through unbelievable drama as they search their souls for answers. When a close friend of Sheldon dies it drives them an apart as Daryl begin to let go Sheldon gains faith.Jacqueline Thomas's A Resolution of Love reminds us to have faith and trust."
5,Tropical Getaway is the perfect read!,"Wow!! I really loved this book. The story is fast paced and keeps you riveted from page one. Dane is an AWESOME hero. Very sexy, and some of his lines made me shiver. I loved him. Ava is fun and fiesty. Her brother, Marco's story line is beautifully done. I definately recommend Tropical Getaway and can't wait to read Roxanne St. Claire's next book."
4,shows promise,"This is a fun read. It starts out great , shows real promise, but just misses. The charachters, especially Ava and Dane, are welldrawn and make you want to keep reading. There is some suspense but its weak and I would call this adventure rather than suspense. The descriptions of the islandsand the people make it worth reading."
4,Great basics (plus 200+ Variants),"I was looking for something that would give me some solid basics (House Rules Examples, Low Hand, basic variants) and a ""How To"". That part of book is solid and useful. Oh yeah, there are are also a boat load of variants that I have only even begun to take in. I will be breaking those out next poker night (about once a month).If your looking for strategy, this isn't really for you, but if you want a book that will make you feel comfortable with basic poker and give you plenty of games to dabble at It's a good purchase."
2,Dissapointing,I was very hopeful regarding this book as I have not been able to find a good 'neighborhood poker' book. However this is not the answer. I did not even realize Phil Foglio's involvement with it until I started to read it and while a big fan of his art/comics I can't reccomend this book.
2,Didn't Like It Much...,Who plays with a 10 cent ante these days? Lots of poker info but somewhat outdated and uninteresting. I'm sure there are better poker books out there somewhere.
2,I second the reviewer from phili 's review,"I have a stat background so like to see some theory, but this aside, I think most users will find it lacks in a decent level of backgound as to what is really going on. Works fine if you want a quick guide to how to get certain multivariate stat procedures done in SAS or some other stat package."
2,overcooked and bland,"From the other comments I've read on this page, the other reviewers seem to have it just right. Where once the Beta Band produced an eclectic multi-instrumental mix of traditional song-writing and sampled-based structuring, they've now ended up playing vaguely annoying gonzo-idie-pop.Strangely, it's the dense mix of varied instrumental sound (that once made them so exciting) that hinders this record. Most instrumental parts seem laboured, too precise, lacking the laid-back slacker-energy of their early work.Steve Mason also has a pretty weak voice, and whereas this was once charmingly lo-fi part of the mix, his vocals are too heavily relied upon, and the monotone results grate more often than not.A once great band, with their best material now surely behind them: Go for ""The 3 EPs"" or ""the Beta Band"" instead."
2,Lacks inventiveness,"This is a band that may be losing it rapidly, which is OK cuz at least they made one great record. It wasn't this one: I don't get the very favorable respose to this album. To be fair, I haven't yet heard HOT SHOTS II, but will soon, because if there's a declension from THE THREE EPs to this latest, then HS2 probably has some good stuff -- and has to be better than the self-titled release. In other words, I thought HEROES TO ZEROS was going to be the answer to BETA BAND. Not. Just less frenetic and more streamlined, yet deperately trying to cling to their incredibly fresh early sound. That distinction got lost in the mix of the self-titled, and now it's trying to resurface through smooth but somehow muddy production along with boring melodies. Thank god the CD ended just now in my ears... Not a good sign. Maybe I'll come back to it; meanwhile, on to HOT SHOTS."
5,Their Best Yet,"If you're a Beta Band fan, then you need this, because it's their best album to date (even including the pseudo-albumness of 3 EP's).If you're new to Beta Band, this is the best place to start!"
1,Back to the Drawing Board,"I really wanted to like this CD...After hearing Assessment blasted over the speakers at BestBuy- I bought this blind based on that song alone-bad choice...In all fairness, the band really tries to layer sounds and explore different landscapes, but it comes off sounding disheveled and not as pulled together as Assessment which had a great vibe of classic rock and almost Hendrix sounding guitar... I just couldn't get into it beyond that. I normally love UK based groups, but I'd sooner recommend checking out Longview's Mercury before trying this. Sorry Beta fans :( just my opinion."
5,Favorite book from childhood,"Who can resist a story about an independent woman living in a tree with her bear and dog friends? This is a favorite from my childhood, that I've shared over and over with my own kids, for its timeless message. Love your neighbor! We could all use a Miss Twiggley in our communities!"
5,Great memories,My mother bought this book for me in the mid 1970's and it has always been my favorate story. I bought it for my kids several years ago and I keep it way up high to preserve this book. I read it to them as often as I can but I think I enjoy it more then them! Go Miss Twiggley!!!
5,In 1st Grade Heaven Again,"As a first grader, I used to check this book out of our classroom library to read and re-read. I even recall spending hours tracing the illustrations. However, as an adult, I could never remember the name of that favorite book. After years of searching in libraries and book databases for children's books with ""willow trees,"" I finally did an Internet search using the same search criteria and was delighted to find not only the correct title and author information but also to discover that it has been reprinted. I have ordered a copy and am so excited to share this wonderful story with my son.I have also discovered that there is a clay-mation video version. I haven't seen it, but I'm hoping to. It looks very good and has won several awards. http://www.bixpix.com/what/twiggley.htmThis book is a terrific story for your kids of all ages. Don't hesitate to purchase a copy for your family!"
4,Miss Twiggley's Tree,"This book of a poem is very interesting for a young person, I took time to read it before giving it away as a gift."
5,Toa Iruni ROCKS!,"(Note: The one on top of this page is COMPLETELY built wrong!)I will now review Iruni, past Toa of Air.The Can: Very attention grabbing. Iruni looks awsome in that pose and the words ""special edition"" really grab your eye. But other than that and it's gold colouring, it's basicly a Hordika can.The Pieces: WOW. Lots of goodies in here. Including:Kanohi KualsiGold Chronicler's staffLots of gold armourRhotuka Shield (Who doesn't like that?)Gold and new Metru Green RhotukaCool, huh?Building: Basicly your average Toa Metru, but with slight differences, including the fact that only his staff arm is controlled by a gear. The other is held by a O friction pin.Playing with it: FUN! It's just as fun to swing his staff around like with the Toa Metru, launching his Rhotuka is as great as always, but it is very enjoyable to just pose him and create your own scenes.I rate Toa Iruni:4.5/5"
3,LEGO Bioncle,"My son loves these toys, but he only likes to put them together once and then usually doesn't play with it again.Good value for Lego product."
1,Wrong manual shipped,The manual that was shipped was not a specific for the 2000 Dakota but was a generalized manual for all Dodge trucks of that era. It was returned to the vendor. Credit has not been received.
5,It is an investment for life. Go for it.,"I have read this book several times each time found it interesting and challenging. Written in an extravagant manner the book touches upon the main techniques of Persuasion. The book helped me a lot while writing me thesis on Persuasion in Advertising. Hope you'll like it too. It a visa for new territories, vague and yet real. Lilly George Bulgaria"
1,Printer died after 1.5 years of infrequent use,"I've been fairly happy with the printer until it just died on me a few days ago. Still have about 90% toners left on all of them. And of course it's out of warranty.Ever since I got it I noticed a faint squeaking electronic noise from the printer when it is idling. I didn't think much of it but now I think it's an indication that the power supply unit is on its way out.According to HP, what's broken is the Low Voltage Power Supply. HP won't sell it to me because it's not a user serviceable part. Sending someone out would cost me close to $900 just for labor. This is ridiculous. Trying to see what other prints would work with my toner, nothing besides the 3600/3800.Avoid this product at all cost! I got it because I like the high capacity toner cartridge. But obviously this made-in-China unit is not that reliable."
1,DO NOT BUY,"This is the worst printer I've ever had. It jams frequently. It does not like to take cardstock from either tray. It takes forever to proces something that has a graphic on it. The print turns out light and hard to read. If tray 2 is not completely full, you get an error message that the tray is empty and the printer won't print until you fill it up. Each time after it prints, it calibrates itself for nearly a minute -- when you combine that with all the jamming, it just leads to further delys in printing. Way to expensive for the quality. HP support is less than helpful. If I could give it zero stars, I would."
3,Expensive cartridges; no windows 7 driver support,"I've had the HP Laser 3600n for a couple of years, and it's a reliable, decent printer that almost never jams. Print quality and speed are both okay, and all things considered I've experienced very few problems with it. That said, I have two big gripes. One is the the cost of the cartridges, which run about $145 to $150 each ($600 for a full refill of all four cartridges, which all have to be replaced at least four times a year). HP gives you a free process for returning the empties, and you'd think they'd give you a price break for each one you send back to them, but they don't. My other complaint is no driver support from HP for Windows 7. I just bought a new pc laptop, and now I can't get the driver. Huh? How can HP be so lame? I'm seriously thinking about getting rid of the printer because it's just too much of an aggravation."
2,Planned Obsolescence,"Purchased(2)printers, both lasted less than 3 years. I thought HP was trying to make money on the toners, but it was cheaper to replace them with a higher quality Brother Color Laser. I have dozens of HP models and most of them last more than 5 years. Maintenance parts were too high price. Cheaper to buy a new printer. Had good luck with CP1518i but it's slower."
1,Horrible Printer & Lousy Customer Service,"The HP 3600n computer is very difficult to set up in a networked environment wirelessly - nearly impossible. The only way to connect wirelessly is with an HP 2400ew Printer Server, which takes true technical expertise to set up and maintain. I have been on and off the phone for the last year with HP's technical support teams - every once in a blue moon I will speak with a well trained, competent tech support person who will speed me through my issues in 15 minutes. The more typical experience is literally hours (just spent 5 hours!!) with untrained, ""going through training"" personnel, who although very polite, do not have a clue as to how to help. I will never buy a HP product again!!"
1,Sneaky reseller,"Ordered this ""new printer"" on line with descriptin of ""What's in the BoxHP Color LaserJet 3600dn Printer; HP LaserJet print cartridge; in-box documentation (Getting Started Guide); software drivers and documentation on CD-ROM; power cable; 100-sheet multipurpose tray; 250-sheet input tray; HP Jetdirect Fast Ethernet embedded print server; automatic two-sided printing; pre-installed, full-capacity 6,000-page black and 4,000-page cyan, magenta and yellow HP Color LaserJet print cartridges with HP ColorSphere Toner. ""When printer arrived no toner at all. Contacted merchant and they claim ""That would be Amazon's general description of the product . As described in the products condition, this unit does not include any toners.""So how do you know that it doesn't contain what is in the description? They agreed to take the printer back for a minimum 15% restocking fee. Sneaky Rees Electronics."
2,"Good printer, lousy networking software","It prints beautiful color pages most of the time. But getting connected to it over the home network is challenging. It just works for some computers and it just doesn't for others. Even the ones that it works for, it forgets how to work now and then requiring a reboot of the PC. This is the second network HP printer (out of two) I've had this problem with. I've replaced one of them with an Epson equivalent, and now all computers in the house can use it reliably. I'll eventually replace my color laserjet with a non-HP printer."
1,HP Color Laserjet 3600n Printer,"I cannot recommend this product as I have had to replace the electrostatic transfer mechanism on this printer 2 times due to mechanical failures. Each lasting an average of only 7 months with minimal use. I have been using HP printing technology for 12 years and have had 5 HP printers 2 of them utilizing color laser technology, models 3600n and color laser 1518ni. HP's Color Laser technology group has been a let down. On a positive note my black and white laser printers are working very well."
1,HP is getting Weaker as a printer option,"I have owned HP printers since I started using Laser Printers. I thought the 2600N was Fair to Good, I wore two out. So when I could not get another 2600, the sales associate showed me the ""upgraded"" model - the 3600n; ""More toner per cartridge, etc"". HP has sent a service representative twice and I have spent over 7 hours on the phone and online with the printer down and I really don't have a mixed platform system (4 XP machines and a Vista - which has yet to be able to print to the printer). What's worse is with the downturn in the economy I cannot afford to replace it and it is less than a year old. It is very irritating that a company does not see the importance of customer support. I have 3 HP computers and 2 Dells and I think I am going to switch away from HP after 10 years of using HP products, the last 2 years have dissuaded me from using HP in the future.Very upset and very stuck with a hearted printer."
2,Have owned 2 and do not recommend,"HP has a good reputation. I always buy HP products (computers, etc.) I bought this printer late 2006. It worked great until I changed the first yellow toner cartridge. I've not had proper color since. Then I changed the Magenta cartridge - now its even worse! Took it in for repairs (HP est. $479 when I can buy new locally for $499). Anyway, didn't go thru HP for the repair, went local. He says I need a new Transfer Belt at a cost of $229... but... he can't seem to find the right part number to order one! He's still working on it. Also, this may NOT be the problem - he says it's his least expensive fix! So, this leads me to buying the 2nd one. Since I bought all new toner cartridges (at a cost of $119 each) and we were in NEED of replacing the printer - we bought a second one! It works great NOW!!! Let's see what happens when I change out the first toner! Sorry, HP, you're messing up your reputation!"
1,The 3600 sucks,"Worst purchase I've ever made. After every print, residue from the last print gets on it. Also, my red in cartridge, my blue ink cartridge, and my yellow ink cartridge all leak. Steer clear of hp products."
1,Big Brother is watching you!,"...for your own good, of course! This printer prints out a secret tracking code on each printed page. It is a set of microscopic yellow dots in a pattern that allows tracing each and every printed page to your printer, and subsequently to you. With a blue LED light and magnifying glass I could see the yellow dots printed in patterns all over the page.Of course, you wouldn't worry about it because you are not going to print out anything remotely illegal, or be a whistle-blower of any sort, right? Then why does HP track you secretly and doesn't tell you anything about it?If I want to sign a paper I can and will do it myself and don't want a printer do it secretly for me. I regret buying this printer.Find informative article by pasting in Google: ""Seeing yellow over color printer tracking devices"""
1,DOES NOT SUPPORT TWO-SIDED PRINTING,"The claims are deceptive, if you have a Mac, you will ONLY print on one side of the paper. I have tried, and tinkered, and tried, and it never works the way the documentation claims. (MacOS 10.5.6, latest drivers as far as I know.) Maybe it's ""not HP's fault"" (i.e., Apple's fault), but pointing fingers does not fix the problem, does it?I tried downloading the ""MacOS drivers"", it provides a DMG, containing a file, that is not one that I recognize (it opens ""Automator"" when I double-click it). FAIL, FAIL, FAIL."
1,"""CLEAR""ly Mislabeled","While the quality of this product seemed satisfactory, the label on the package states that the case is clear when it is actually contains a black tray. Don't make the same mistake I did."
3,"not bad, i like it",I like the fact that i could get a cabinet with my teams logo. Its fairly well built. the doors needed a little tweeking to align them correctly. If you are a serious dart shooter the bristle board it comes with is top notch. The darts are ok for the average shhoter but if you are really into darts you might want to buy a decent set. I would recommand this product.
5,Much nicer than I expected.,Made of very heavy and nice materials. The item was shipped and packed great. It came on time. Thought the price was high until I saw the quality and realized why the price was so high. Very pleased.
5,super bowl of dart boards,Strong Wood. Easy To Hang But Doesn't Come WithHardware. WE Hung Two Two By Fours In The Garage And Mounted The Cabinet To Them.
5,Really nice dartboard set!,I bought this for my husband as a Father's Day gift. He absolutely loves it! The wood is pretty good quality--not cheap looking at all (was worried about that). It shipped well and fast! I paid extra for 2-3 day delivery and received it next day!!! Would recommend to any who likes playing darts and likes football too!!! Made a great gift!!!
5,San Diego Chargers Dart Board,I haven't personally seen the dart board because it was a Christmas present sent across the country. I had it delivered right to the recipient. It arrived quickly and was well packed. He seems to like it. The seller was very accurate and prompt.
5,Great Product for a great price!,"I was suprised at the quality considering it was a licensed NFL product for a great price. We have been very happy with the product. It doesn't get used every day, but so far we haven't had any problems with it."
4,Nice cabinet. Decent board. So so darts,"For the price, I was pleasantly surprised. The cabinet is nice looking knotty pine. The picture on Amazon is accurate representation of color. It was somewhat easy to put together. You may need help mounting it to the wall. The bristle board is not competition quality but better than expected for my rec room. It even has a staple free bull! The darts are another story. I would never play with these in my dart league. But will be good enough for guests. The scoreboards are a little small and the chalk eraser is useless so I got a full-size one. Other than these minor quirks, a definite 4 stars."
4,present for hubby,"my husband loves this dartboard...well constructed and as pictured...needed handyman to help install, but love it!"
3,bears pine cabinet dartboard,"the board is great the cabinet was damaged in shipping needs better packing,but overall happy with product"
4,Buffalo Bills Dartboard Set,"This is a quality product. I admit I was a little disappointed that the emblems were only stickers, but they don't seem as though they'll come off. All components are quality. Thank you for a great Christmas gift!"
5,Clinician's Handbook,Excellent up-to-date presciption drug reference book...includes recommended dosages and other info not found in the other handbooks I've used as well as all the info (such as drug interactions) that is found in the others ... JPV
5,The Real Deal!,"You want the true story about the ""War On Drugs""? Then don't wait and buy this book NOW. Bowden takes you right inside what's going on with this so called war, and the people who get hurt by it. Once you pick up this book you won't be able to put it down. Charles Bowden is one of this country's great reporters/writers.Jay MarvinWLS RadioChicago, IL"
3,Clunky and convoluted writing and story-telling,"For those who are interested in the failed 'War on Drugs' and are proponents of drug policy reform, this book graphically describes why we are on the right side of the debate. However, I found the author's writing style difficult to follow. The story-telling was not linear and jumped around too much. I had a hard time keeping straight all the names, dates, facts and figures.Nevertheless, I recommend this book because of its subject matter."
3,Fascinating story but poorly organized,i was deeply absorbed in this book for the first 300 pages and then i started to lose track of names and incidents. it is certainly one of the most compelling stories i have ever read. i only wish that bowden could have organized it better. this is not the kind of book that you read before you take your lithium. it is really smashing and makes you wonder what in the world we could be complaining about here in the u.s.
1,Not For Anybody,Truly one of the worst books I've ever read. Boring from the first ten pages all the way through the slow death the finally ends this turd of a book. SAVE YOUR MONEY - No one will understand or appreciate this mess.
2,"Sorry, it's a difficult read","I've really tried to get through this book, and at page 267 I had to give up. Yes, the author has information, and if you need a master reference to other articles the biography/footnotes would be very useful to you, but it is presented in a disorganized way and is depressing to read. I cannot track the names and relationships among them. Mr. Bowden has been elaborating on who Amado Carrillo is for over a hundred pages. He says things such as ""A meeting took place. Or didn't. A man is paid to look the other way."" For me it needs to be written less like I'm following a drunken Mexican around listening to his brain farts and more like a structured history of drug trade.druglord.com has a picture of Amado Carrillo. The book has no pictures, no diagrams of relationships, and no real structure in its words to help you create one. You are going to need some other source to help you make sense of the material in this book."
2,Not effective.,"After reading several news stories about the bristles from traditional wire brushes causing emergency room visits, we decided to try this design.The Good+ There are no wire bristles to end up lodged in your intestines necessitating a trip to the emergency room.The Bad+ The scrubbing pad is covered by the attachment mechanism. You lose most of the center of the pad, leaving only the outer edge to actually clean your grill.+ The scrubbing pad does not work very well. The grill stayed dirty after repeated scrubbing. The top service of the grate was clean-ish, but the sides could not be reached by the pad.ConclusionWe went back to a traditional wire brush. We scrub with that, then use long tongs to wipe the grate down with a damp paper towel. It adds an extra step, but it takes less time than a trip to the emergency room."
2,"""Surprises"" were too obvious, Character uninteresting","I downloaded this book for MS Reader without knowing anything about the author. Although the premise of the book seemed somewhat intriguing at first, I got tired of the author trying to ""surprise"" me with events that were so obvious that a kid would have seen them coming. With few exceptions, the characters were not given enough ""character"" to make them interesting in the least. I can't believe that this is supposed to be a best-selling author. I suppose on some levels this book could be interesting (such as the descriptions of Miami), but for me it was plain boredom."
4,Would read it again!,"Although a little gorey and graphic, this book kept my nose stuck between the pages.The concept behind the storyline is brilliant and original.The characters are very well defined, and their stories unfold seamlessly.Strongly recommended!"
5,I couldn't put it down.,I thought the premise was crazy. Who would believe this could even happen - who would contract to have themselves killed - and then leave $46 million to the contracted killer? But who was the 'real' killer? I kept changing my guesses all the way through the book and was wrong to the end.
3,A Few Stumbles,"Grippando is a fairly compelling writer but, as an attorney, his depictions of the legal process should be more realistic. For example, there is a brief scene in this book intended to demonstrate the protagonist's skill at trial work. Unfortunately, what is being attempted by another attorney is nothing less than fraud upon the court. Instead of being hauled up before the court and the state's disciplinary administrator, the attorney is permitted to quietly withdraw his manufactured accusations against Swytec's client. Not likely. In addition, the wildly coincidental and ""happy"" ending of the book seems unnecessary, since the Florida probate process would probably provide a similar, and much more believable, resolution."
1,If I could have given 0 stars i would have,"It's basically pro Hamas propaganda, an apologetic view of a terrorist organization.......I think this says it all.... Shame on the author"
2,A bit disappointment,"This book is not excellent. What could be said in two pages is here said in twenty. Moreover, there is hardly anything new in chapters about Hamas relations with PLO or Arab states. I expected a lot more."
4,Soild training gun for the price.,"Great for handgun handing and firing stance demonstration. Feels sturdy and the bright, high-lighter yellow keeps you out of trouble."
4,Good for what it is intended to be used for...,"If your intent is to practice gun disarms and you just can't bring yourself to bang up your Glock in the process then this product is a completely acceptable choice. For working in the gym or the back yard where the piece will be hitting the ground over and over I think it will ""function as designed"" just fine. It is reasonably priced so I rate it as four stars for that. However, take my advice and do not try to hold up a liquor store with it or you may be writing reviews from the prison library too. Now if they just made a rubber shank...."
4,Great training tool,I participate and teach in Judo and Aikido. The gun is a good weight and it holds up to many repetitions. I have told several other participants in my class about this item. It is a great training gun for under $20.
4,Does the job...,What I like most about this gun is that it is rubber; so it does not tear up your hands when training with it. The downside is that it has a California carcinogen warning.
5,Just what it says,Just exactly like it is described. Arrived quick and seems to be well made. Holding up to Krav Maga work so it must be OK.
4,the long lost hit (sort of),"""Someone Loves You Honey"" was a monster hit back in the early 1980s. Cpoyright problems kept it from being released on CD until recently. The version included on this disk does not include the toasting by Prince Mohammed on the original release. The rest of the material on the disk is by and large similar to ""Someone"" -- 1960s/1970s country and pop tunes done reggae style -- though none of the other tracks match the wallop of the title track."
2,Many parts not available,"I have the model SL-7, and I tried getting replacement parts but the only parts available are the battery and the bulbs.The screw-on lens covers on my unit have yellowed through age and the light therefore is not as bright as it could be - but no replacement covers. Althought the solar panel on my unit is cracked, it still charges the battery, but no replacement solar units are available.My unit no longer lights even with a replacement battery, but I am leery of buying bulbs because if the unit still does not light, I am out of options.The light worked well when it worked, but be aware that there are few replacement parts."
2,Not well built,"This item works, but is made with cheap, fragile parts. Of the 5 I acquired, I had to glue multiple parts in a fixed, vice the flexible position it is supposed to have."
4,Works as expected,"This light is not used as a critical source because living in north eastern US we don't get enough sunlight in winter months to keep the battery charged. This is true with most low end solar devices. Other than that, it works as expected."
3,Comments,"This book is not bad, but is not the greatest thing I've read. A big positive is the historical background information on the revolution in Cuba. I have not been able to confirm all what is said in it but it does serve to put things in context regarding the parents' need to making a decision in light of their dilemma: Stay as is or at least provide the choice to their children to live in the free world. The book does a good job in sharing enough balance of anecdotal information with the author's own observations from her periodical research. This is not PhD work but it is enough to make you think about the issue beyond just the reading. The book is biased towards the negative and the fact that the anecdotal data is segmented throughout the book makes it hard to follow a specific person's experience through the different stages in life.Not bad. Good read if you are a parent."
1,NO ES: La Historia Inedita de Operacion Pedro Pan,"No es cierto que este libro de Yvonne Conde sea la historia inedita sobre la Operacion Pedro Pan. Randon House en Espanol deberia de haberse informado que esto era un dato completamente incorrecto. La mentira del titulo le resta credibilidad al libro. Es una pena que los cuestionarios nu hubiesen sido preparados por expertos en research para tener un ejemplo valido sobre la experiencia de los pedro panes. Que revelancia puede tener cuantos televisores, radio y telefonos habian en Cuba en esa epoca con el exodo de los ninos cubanos? Esto sucedio durante la Guerra Fria cuando imperaba el panico al comunismo y a la indoctrinacion de la juventud. Los pedro pans de Texas que he conocido tubieron experiencias mas positivas de los que aparecen en el libro. Pero eso no es lo que vende libros hoy en dia, el abuso de ninos si."
3,"Disturbing, provocatively interesting","While almost the entire book left me wondering why, as I sifted through stories of dysfunction and melancholy, I kept reading and at times marveled at the range of experiences Sena Jeter Naslund's characters encountered. The final story, Disobedience of Water, made me feel so much better about the book. A strong ending for what seemed a troublesome ensemble of stories. I recommend this book, with caution, as some may find some content questionable or uncomfortable. But it will broaden your horizons!"
1,Broken Motherboard,"I recived this board used from geeks, completly smashed! Not to mention it was packages in cardboard and newspaper which is an excelent way to create static, I'm currently in the process of bending every pin back and hopefully not be able to replace the capasitors that were ripped off the board during shipping. The heatsink and cpu was left on it however the cpu cooler was not attached, the result was a smashed norhtbridge heatsink and cpu cooler. Thanks for the 36$ rip off."
5,Little Steven's Underground Garage Classic,"This is above average Underground garage material if I ever saw it. Texas punk from the first wave. Catchy tunes, powerful guitar leads and sound, it all comes together behind Thom (Tex) Edwards vocals. The version of Strange Movies beats the original Troggs version. My Girlfriend is a Rock has now been covered by several other bands. How can you tell is a full out rage of a song. take a listen"
4,"Arts and crafts of ancient Hawaii, in drawings and photographs","This is a very nice reference book of the arts and crafts of ancient Hawaii (focusing on pre-European contact). In a land of fish, rocks, and plants, arts and crafts tended to be focused on these resources. It also notes the occasions where honu scutes were used as net mesh gauges, jewelry, and hooks."
4,Munly is awesome,"If you like Munly, this is another of his , which generally means it's going to be sweet, like his other stuff."
5,Beautiful beads,I bought these beads to make bracelets. I was very impressed by the quality of the beads. None are chipped or broken. The colors are beautiful and the designs amazing. This is the second time I have bought them and when I get close to using these up I am sure I will be placing another order.
5,excellent Quality but Slow Service,"The cd Portugal arrived nearly 4 weeks later. The product was brand new, but so much time elapsed before its arrival in our mailbox."
2,poorly,"This program is outdated. It has very good information but very poor navigation though out the entire program. Very hard to learn how to use it and printing images can be a pain, I haven't tried any other programs with this kind of information but i would hope they would be set up better then this."
3,disappointingly brief,"after listening, with great pleasure, to Japanese Melodies for Flute and Harp for many years, i finally purchased this companion cd. still charming, but its total play time of under 35 minutes is quite irritating. also, the larger orchestral arrangements are fine but the plaintive simplicity of the rampal laskine collaboration is entirely missing."
3,Metafiction,I think this is what you might call Metafiction. And I never met a fiction I didn't like.
2,Ambitious flops,"This is a collection of a novella and three short stories. The novella is about a college student dying of AIDS who is attended to by his roommate. To pass the time, they invent stories about world events and an Italian family in Helsinki. We learn very little about the family and nothing about Helsinki. It is a good refresher course in 20th century events as well as the process of slowly dying, but it is surprisingly flat emotionally. I loved the second story, about a fellow visiting Washington, D.C. and happening on the premiere of a string concerto by a Vietnam veteran. The third story is nine versions of a letter sent by a prison warden to a mother describing the last hours in the life of her son. It exposes a range of possibilities as to how people might face their execution. I am drawing a blank on the final story after only two weeks, if that tells you something. Read the second story, period"
1,Tedious!,"The names of the stories in this collection should serve as a warning: here there be pretentiousness.I can recommend the second story, ""The Time I Heard the Private Donald J. Rankin String Concerto with One Discordant Violin, by the American Composer John Morton."" The others, especially ""Manner of Dying,"" were pretty pointless. The last two stories in this book were written primarily using a word processor's copy/paste function, ergo they are a waste of time.I thought Life of Pi was great and deserving of the hype, so Martel isn't on my black list; However, this early work is less polished and shows only glimpses of his talent."
5,"Simple, but transformative.","This is a collection of short stories by author Yann Martel, predating his Booker Prize winning 'The Life of Pi'. All of the stories offer insightful views of humanity, told in Martel's simple, anecdotal style, but it is the penultimate 'Manners of Dying' that I found most remarkable. By way of a letter to the mother of an executed man, written multiple times, Martel changed my intellectual objection to capitol punishment into a visceral disgust of same. It is a brilliant piece of writing, which also allows the reader a glimpse of the hard social criticism that underpins all of Yann Martel's work."
3,Put together wrong,"I was so excited to receive this. It comes already assembled, which is great. Unfortunately, when mine came I discovered it was put together wrong. I mean really wrong; it was unusable. The only way to fix it would have been to take it apart and drill additional holes into the top and realign the arm that holds the kettle.I was very disappointed but Amazon was great about paying the shipping for return and making it easy to send back. I'm hoping it's a fluke and am ordering another one."
5,Paragon TP-4 Theater Pop 4-Ounce Popper Popcorn Machine,"Product was as advertised, came very quickly, would buy from this vendor again. Thanks!"
3,The Continuing Human-Posleen War series,"I like Ringo's Posleen books quite a bit, but When the Devil Dances and Hell's Faire would have been better as a single (somewhat slimmer) book. Note - To his credit, the author does discuss why the books came out the way they did instead of as one work."
4,"Great, but lacks an ending","You know that feeling where you're loving a story, but you're at 85% thru and you can just tell there's not enough room left for a decent ending? This is that book. On the bright side, it doesn't have some total BS/copout ending where 8 story lines falls into place in last chapter. On the not-so-bright side, there really is no ending...Ringo just quit writing and sent it off to be published. On the bright side, the next books in series have been out for a long time, so I can (and am) grabbing the next one."
5,I'm a John Ringo fan but I'll try and be objective,"This clearly is not the end of this series. I guess a lot of us were expecting it to be a trilogy but I think this is going to be an ongoing saga.All three of the books in this series are great. I have read each numerous times. One of the things I like best about this book was that there is more development of other characters. This has turned out not to be a book about Mike O'Neal, not that it would be bad if it were, but this book allows us to explore more of the characters that make these books great.Ringo clearly wants to go further with this series. It is such a complex world he has created and I look forward to the next installment to see what else he has up his sleeve."
1,keeps getting worse,"Just terrible- A Hymn Before Dying was decent, the second book was mediocre this one was just wretched. You cannot call this military scifi-this was the script for a crappy B-movie. It doesn't matter if he left you hanging with this book because it isn't worth the effort to keep reading his stuff."
5,outstanding,An outstanding book in a great series. I cannot wait until the next episode--John Ringo Please write quickly!
3,Need to finish the story line,"A recent trend among writers is to create the never ending story. If you can keep them coming back for the next installment, then you have them hooked.John Ringo has written several books with David Weber. I had hoped that the 'Suits' series would be more in line with the 'Honor Harrington' series.Tell a story well and end it well. Than continue new plot lines and adventures in the next book.I like the series to date, but come on, how any I supposed to remember that Mike's wife is dead / ?missing? in space (book 2) or what are the relationship between all the various people or the status of the cliff hangers in this book.Please lets end this plot line, end it well and continue on with the next book with new plot lines and stories."
3,A bit or comfort food.,"While at times this book reads like a collection of works by other authors (the bibliography is longer than that of a Master's thesis) Cadmus' style is as warm and gentle as a family supper after church. His relating specific examples of Christian living into a broad-brush approach to life is done without fire and brimstone.While I don't think this book will change lives, it's feel-good approach will be welcomed by individuals who shy away from theology-based religious publications."
5,Awesome deal!,This is one of Pulsar's best watches in my opinion. It has a great size (43mm is not too big not too small) and it looks very similar to the Seiko version (Seiko Men's SKX009K2 Diver) but this is less than half. It is smaller than the seiko since the seiko is closer to a 45 or 46mm but for the price its a great deal. The bracelet is very shiny and nice but it is also very light. So men who are looking for a bigger watch might want to consider the Seiko. But even the Seiko version has the same type of bracelet. I posted pictures of both of them side by side on my profile. Check out the pics I posted for this watch.
5,Pulsar 100M Chronograph,"This is a great watch! I was looking on acution sites and found this to be a much better deal on price and quality. This watch has everything I wanted in a watch to wear swimming and for timing racers. I have several Seiko watches and this is a Seiko owned brand, so I trust the quality is very good. Grab one while you can!"
2,Obscure Chetkovich,"Thank goodness this text was edited(?) by someone who has reflected on the Bible. Everyone in this book writes like a Steinbeck want-to-be. Catching my eye most drastically was the search result blurb from Google: ""In this autobiographical essay, Chetkovich, an obscure short story writer, ..."" I hope that is the correct spelling of the word ""obscure."" Does the use of the term ""obscure short story writer"" not actually mean ""this writer is so bad arse, she MUST be read. Immediately! She MUST have as much of your money as possible, she MUST occupy as much of your household thought as possible."" Hmmm...sounds like a writer I want to read. Where'd she get the name ""Kathryn""? Isn't that a name for someone who requires a lot of your attention? I used to respect the name Chetkovich. I know better now."
2,"Good quality, poor customer service","The book is in excellent condition. It is of no use to me however. I did not recieve the book until almost a month after I ordered it. I had to use it for one of my classes,and I could not wait any longer for it to arrive, so had to go to the school bookstore and buy another copy of the book. When the copy i bought from the Amazon merchant arrived, I tried to return it, but I could not find a return address anywhere. I sent the merchant an e'mail asking for a return address four days ago, but I have still not recieved an address. I am very disappointed by this lack of customer service, and because I will probably not be able to get a refund now, since it has been more than thirty days since I ordered the book."
4,"Faces and Beer, Beatles and garage","I first heard The Capitol Years when they were essentially a one-man operation with alt-country leanings, when I stumbled on the fantastic song, ""Faces and Beer."" Since then they've evolved into a fully realized band and released the blistering garage rock Jewelry Store EP, which found them losing their acoustic guitars in favor of raw, high energy, electric rock and roll. On Let Them Drink, they combine the best of their songcrafting instincts, letting their inner Beatles shine with a white, bright light, while keeping it raw, real, and rocking. Every incarnation of The Capitol Years is worth checking out if you are a fan of roots, garage, or pop rock, to be honest - they continue to prove themselves to be inspired in everything they do."
3,Great printer. But what's with Amazon's Price,"This is a $799 printer from HP and every other online reseller I can find. Yet Amazon is selling it for $975. What is going on with Amazon?As for the printer, it is great for the high-end home office, or small work groups within companies. It is fast and prints beautiful business documents. I would not use it for photo printing and super posh brochures, but short those two uses, it is a fantastic business printer.Finally, there is great value at $799.One caveat, watch out for the cost of toner. It's going to run you about 70-80% of the original cost of the printer. (It's HP's new and pathetic business model. Terrible for the environment. Terrible for customers. But sadly gauging customers over toner is the only thing keeping HP afloat.)In summary, this is a great printer, but do not buy from Amazon until the price falls to $799. And watch for the toner costs when that day comes. It may make sense just to buy a new printer. (Crazy, I know.)"
1,I HATE this printer!!,"I have a medical office and Labcorp installed this printer in my lab. It is connected to their central lab via phone line and prints color path histology reports and lab chemistry results. I hate this thing and would throw it out the window if I could! It jams constantly, the color rendition is off, it periodically shreds one long edge of paper, and dog-ears the short end. No one can figure out how to choose which of three paper trays to print to- the printer stubbornly decides regardless of our wishes.This replaced a color laser OKI which was superb. I HATE, HATE, HATE this printer!"
4,"Good quality, reliable color printer","I haven't had any problems with this printer since I got it two years ago. We don't do a lot of printing (I'm about to replace the black cartridge for the first time). With four computers on the network, we leave the printer on always. It's pretty quiet in power-saving mode. To date, the only maintenance it has required is the addition of paper to the feed tray.HP has probably come up with something better during the past few years, but this thing has been so reliable, I'm not in the market. (No, I have no affiliation with HP.)"
1,"Horrible, poor quality printer","I had constant problems with this printer, and then it died and was unrepairable after less than two years of extremely light home office use. I only changed the black ink cartridge once and never changed the color cartridges - that's how little I used it. Yet I had constant problems with jammed paper and streaky ink smudges, and printing on any size other than 8.5x11 was a gigantic hassle. Then one day I tried to take out the black ink cartridge (because it kept smudging) and couldn't get it back in. Turns out, there was a little wire sticking out that was, according to the repair person, part of the frame, which can't even be ordered as a replacement part (so it was unfixable at any cost). TOTAL waste of money! Stay far, far away from this printer (and maybe any HP, if this piece of junk is any indication)."
5,Houston Ska at its Best,"I've seen these guys for 6 years now, and I was disappointed in hearing that they will soon call it quits. Regardless, if you are reading this, it is your god-given duty to buy this CD. The sound is incredible... not what you would expect from a non-major label recording. The songs are tight, with a great bass and stellar vocals from Thomas Escalante. If you live in a big city, pay close attention to the first track... you will appreciate it. There is not one dud on here... SKA RULES, and so do the Suspects!"
1,Monster Rap Cd,THIS CD IS NOT PUT TOGETHER WELL AT ALL DONT LIKE IT SAVE YOUR MONEY BE WISE PASS THIS CD UP!! I WOULD NOT ORDER THIS CD AGAIN!!! KC.
5,"AMONG WARRIORS IN IRAQ: Five Stars . . . Tucker, like Hemingway, and more.","AMONG WARRIORS IN IRAQ: Five Stars. Yes, Tuckerlike Hemingway. And more. The engaging, insightfulintelligence analyses of the guerrilla war inIraq, from US warriors of all ranks in Mosuland Fallujah, made this a great, unique read.Exciting, poetic narrative, yes, as manyreviewers have noted. 5 stars."
5,"BUY IT NOW: A CLASSIC, AMONG WARRIORS IN IRAQ","Buy it now and enjoy it forever. This is a classic.AMONG WARRIORS IN IRAQ will endure. The writing is tight, solid,rich and engaging. Mike Tucker weaves a tapestry of manythreads, all well-honed: the guerrilla war in Iraq comesalive in the words of American warriors and their actions.I have read no other book on the war that lets the soldierstell their story, like this one--just the 1st half of the bookis worth the full price of this book, alone. And this is history:Tucker, alone, saw that the 82nd Airborne was on the tip ofthe spear in Fallujah, listened to his incredible sources inKurdish intelligence and US Army Special Forces, and thuswrote the ONLY account of the perilous raids against Al Qaedaand Zarqawi cells, and Iraqi insurgents, you will find. So muchof this book is exclusive, it's brilliant. A classic of our time and for all time.The voices of the warriors come shining through.Bravo, as many other readers have said. Bravo."
1,"Bad, horrible, uninteresting, crappy",Save your money. This is the worst book I've read out of twenty plus books on Iraq and Afghanistan. The author tries to hard to be descriptive to the point of being plain dumb and confusing. Sometimes it feels like he's writing from notes and then interjects dialogue that wouldn't even be put in a B movie. He gives nicknames to everyone he interacts with for some unknown reason but fails to describe the person and/or their unique personality quirks to make it interesting. Whatever the author does now for a day job is what he should stick to cause writing interesting and worthy narratives about our troops isn't where he should concentrate his efforts. He apparently lives in the southeast asia are now. Please stay there and write for them. This book sucked and instead of adding it to my library I have commended it too the city dumps.
1,Poorly Written,"This book suffers from poor or perhaps no editing. The writting is just poor. There are many incomplete sentences and paragraphs are often poorly structured and fail to convey any organized thought or idea.It is clear that the author has done some interesting things in his life and that he witnessed the hardships and sacrifices made by US soldiers in Iraq. However, without substantial re-editing, I cannot recommend this book.Finally, I must agree with some previous reviewers, this books rating has been trumped up by friends of the author. His friends time would be better spent helping the author re-edit the book for a more coherent second edition."
1,"This is just a roughdraft, right?","Interesting subject and perspective.Poorly written with no noticable editing.Wait for the 2nd edition or look elsewhere (Jon Anderson, Steve Coll, Robert Baer)"
2,So much wasted potential,"I'll make this quick. Tucker follows some of the greatest units in the Army putting himself in danger countless times. The author also clearly knows his history and understands the soldiers he travels alongside. Unfortunately Tucker's writing style is by no means concise and he often seems to focus on very minute details; this, couple with his need to involve himself in the book as an apparently nonobjective observer ruins what could have been a great book."
2,Not worth buying new,"The author apparently has lacked some significant schooling in journalism, as his style is off beat and hard to follow at times."
2,Not Good,"I really wanted to like this book, but in the end I hated it. Tucker drove me up the wall with his constant use of nicknames. It might not have been bad if Tucker had given more detail about the person or the event that caused the soldier to have the nickname, but unfortunately he didn't. It made the book lag and it made it incredibly hard to follow. I've read countless books on OIF and I would suggest any one of them over this one."
3,Neither as Good or as Bad as most of these Reviewers say,"While I won't slam this book like some reviewers have, I must agree that Mr. Tucker's use of nicknames does very little to add to the value of the book (though it probably adds twenty pages to its length), and often makes the story and events confusing. However, his descriptions of patrols that he accompanied our troops on are first rate"
4,The guy at least tried...,"Mike Tucker was just this goofy correspondent dude who shows up right before we get on the helicopters to raid outside Mosul for a big pile of mortar rounds. He misspelled my platoon leader's name, but hey, he was the only guy we had taking notes on that mission. At least somebody noticed I was doing a good job on the mine detector even if it was my second day. Still, I didn't even know I was in this book until two years after it came out. Reading the 3/502 portions, I know most everyone in it, and everyone's at least recognizable if you look at it though the same glasses Mike looks at the world with."
4,Among Warriors In Iraq,"Mike Tucker follows his book about the Kurds in Iraq with an action packed close look at the ground troops in Iraq. This is a close up, in their tracks picture with the nicknames and raw language you might expect, but also the intellegence and committment of the soldiers there. If you want to hear what they really do, follow Tucker on raids and when the squad gets back and kicks back. And maybe what I really liked about this story is that Mike fills in with history of the region and throws in some of his philosophy to round out the whole picture."
1,Pure rubbish,"this has got to be the most pathetic book on the Iraq War...it is utter rubbish...the author calls himself ""Hawk"" ..how about sparrow""?.and what about the little gherka knife he carries..good in a real firefight mate.Nothing happen!!!...he travels in a gun truck with soldiers ...he calls them obscure and ridiculous nick names.People... save yourself a few bucks and look elsewhere for a real book...and ignore those glowing reports and reviews sent in by his buddies....the author should get a real job like selling insurance maybe..."
2,not so hot,This book is very confusing and hard to keep up with. The author likes to give everything and everybody nicknames in the middle of every other paragraph. Its way detail descriptive and makes for a very boring read right from the start. It will take a while to finish this one.
2,Flawed,"While I think the author tries to do the situation justice and illustrates the situations well, I think he views the Arabs in Iraq far too harshly because of his obvious support of the Kurds. Furthermore, I feel that his style of writing is weak. How many times are we told that Person X has a M-9 Beretta in a holster? 11 times before, I stopped counting. How many times are we told the stars are like those in the Karen Highlands? Over and over, things are repeated and it does not flow well. The author also makes some technical mistakes in describing arms and equipment that could have been corrected with a quick fact check so I have to knock it down a few stars. When looked at next to the Bing West or Rick Atkinson first hand accounts of OIF and the Insurgency, Among Warriors just does not compare."
1,save your money,"i had just finished bing west's book ""no true glory"" and started ""among warriors in Iraq"". this book is terrible. could not finish it. not even in the same league as ""no true glory"". save your money. the nicknames he gives people are laughable such as ""hero of the kurds"", ""kentucky rifle"" etc. PFC Jesse McClure was nicknamed ""john grady cole"". Huh? geez how about ""mick or jess"". no nickname was too ridiculous. his descriptions of operations was weak. he spent way too much describing the sky, rain, sand etc instead of the actual actionhemingway? give me a break. i give it 1 star because zero stars was not an option"
5,"Good mix, very fun","This cd is very fun indeed. There are even some tracks with scratching, which of course sounds very wicked with happycore. I would agree though with the other reviewer, its not the best, and its not the worst. it is Good though, I recomend that if you like happy hardcore you buy this. I enjoy the song Original Style very much."
5,$99.99 for THIS WTF,THIS is a great song but ITS NOT WORTH 99.99 I would suggest getting this single off itunes same songs and everything for 2.99 better deal! whoever is selling this for 99.99 is crazy! like WTF!
3,3 stars,"I really like her type of music but ""smile"" is still the best song on the cd, on any of her cds."
4,"not kinky's best, but good","this book is the latest in the adventures of country star turned best selling author kinky friedman. it brings back the village irregulars (kinky's cast of crazy characters) & continues the friedman series. this book isn't about solving mysteries as much as it is about a unique outlook on life that is both humane and to the point. kinky's mantra is: if you can't laugh a little at life then there doesn't seem to be much worth living for. this book adheres to this addage and provides the reader with a fun trip in search of a young autistic boy who only says ""shnay"" while in persuit of a lost three legged cat named lucky. definately worth a read if you are just looking for something fun or if you are a returning friedman fan."
4,Perfect gift for the Jewish animal-lover on your list,"Not my favorite Kinky Friedman book, but still pretty humorous.Perfect gift for the Jewish animal-lover on your list - afun Mother's Day present, maybe."
4,This is Kinky alright.,"This time around, Kinky has to find a missing three-legged cat who resides down in Texas, and a missing autistic child in NYC. With his band of irregulars, including Rambam, Mcgovern, and Ratso, you're treated to another hilarious and unpredictable romp through the mind of Kinky. This is one book you shouldn't have trouble finishing in one sitting. Offbeat and hilarious.Recommended."
3,"KINKY DOESN""T ""TAKE A NIXON""","This good Friedman.If you read his books, then you already plan to read this one. If you haven't, then start with the first""GREENWICH KILLING TIME"" or""Jesu,etc""It's fun, and there are many quoatable lines. Of course , you don't read Kinky for plot or endings( which are usually weak) but for language, fun,insight.It's has about as many memorable phrases as his other books, and less gross outs. If you like his books, you'll love Tim DORSEY's. I have a feeling , that this is really an old book he wrote several years ago and was never published.Most of the usual characters are in the books, but they are very toned down .If you are a kinky fan buy it, if you are not then try any of his other books first."
4,Beach Boys all-light.,"After having played both my cassette and vinyl L.P. of the Beach Boys' 'Light Album' to death I finally found it on C.D. It came from Japan and the packaging was in Japanese. Highly apt for an album where the Boys sing in Japanese on one track - Sumahama. Then there's a remake of Here comes the Night which I found better than the original. The tracks, from Good Timing to Shortening Bread, sound as fresh as the day they were recorded and the C.D.'s packaging faithfully mimics the original vinyl - it's almost as if they have bonsaid the original! All Light? It's incledible!"
2,Innocence Lost,"As a kid growing up in the 80's, the amount of baseball cards you had was often one indicator of your coolness factor and social status. We collected, traded, and spent every birthday dollar on these things and that stupid piece of gum that was like chewing on a strip of slate. It was fun, sure, but as kids we were led to believe buying baseball cards was as good as investing in gold. We all had access to the Becket pricing guide and thought we just needed to hold on to these cards for about 20 years, sell them, then buy a mansion in the hills.It's now 20 years later. I suppose these cards are one more thing from a vastly optimistic childhood that just seems silly as a logical adult. My set of these still has the price tag on them. In 1989, my dad bought me this complete set for $[...]. Today, it's barely worth $[...] depending on where you look. What a scam.We were sold a dream, but it was a lie told to kids to make a buck. Do yourself a favor and switch to a different hobby."
5,Fantastic Read! Find the truth!,"All the claims in this book are, indeed, verifiable. This is an amazing expose of the Bush Administration. For more on this same subject try David Icke's book called ""Tales from the Time Loop."" It will rock your reality."
4,A Must read,As many of the reviewers before have said. This is definately a must read.Although Nafeez Mosaddeq Ahmed is extremely repetitive and sometimes comes off sounding like he's trying to convince himself more than the reader. But the facts do not lie. You can look up every source he sites and double check the facts yourself. Although there is no way of truely knowing the absolute truth regarding 9-11. This is as close as you'll ever get.It also has some startling predictions that the author may have no completely realised until the recent war with Iraq. Some of his observations and that of some of the sources he sites in the book are startling and to be honest damn scary.In the end I gave this book 4 stars. Mainly for the rehashing he does. In a couple of spots he practically resites entire paragraphs from 3 or 4 pages back.After reading this you will definately look more closely and question more deeply our foreign policy.
4,"HANDS DOWN ,THE BEST BOOK ON 9/11","Jam packed with information regarding the so called war on Terrorism. Ahmed begins by tracing the origins of what happened on 9/11 to just prior to the Soviet Invasion of Afganistan and takes us up to them months prior to 9/11,including the so-called intelligence breakdown that occurred. Ahmed also examines the including the FAA and NORAD's abandoning of SOP's that apparently occured the morning of 9/11, and the subsequent changing of stories by the government. The only drawback is that the author's writing style is very dry which makes for a tough read. I'm just waiting for the label of ""nutjob"" and ""conspiracy theorist"" to be attached to Ahmeds name by those suffering from the ""I don't wanna hear it"" and ""the government is not corrupt"" syndrome."
2,Blaming the Victim,"Politically correct nonsense, unabashedly blaming the victim. To really understand the world and 9-11, you must read Victor Davis Hanson's ""An Autumn of War."" Buy this book and the much smaller and much more profound Hanson book--read them both from cover to cover and decide for yourself."
1,A book title which is most apt,"If you are a foaming-at-the-mouth Bush hater, this is the book for you. It has enough red meat to keep you going for months. There is nothing in here which an objective observer of events as they occured could possibly agree with. If you want a book title that fully describes the contents, you need not even open the cover. This is a classic example of why political discourse in this country has become so raw. ""Facts"" which are substantiated by numerous references to nothing but rumor, repeated ad nauseum until it can only be called a polemic which declares war on freedom. I had thought that Oliver Stone's conspiracy theories were the ultimate in nonsense until I read this book. I must confess that I cheated and only read two thirds of it since the book could easily be condensed to thirty pages if the repetition were taken out.What a waste of paper."
1,Junk Journalism,"Delusionial conspiracy theories...Check out the ""real ""sources of the ""facts"" Irresponsible journalism , propaganda at its worst."
1,This book is the worst I have ever read...,"Delusionial conspiracy theories are a dime a dozen. This one tops the list. Use your money for something more interesting and truthful, like the National Equirer."
1,Book Disgraces Muslims...,Anyone writing a book like this must have poor self image. The author does little to portray the facts. Looking for simple paper clippings and articles taken out of context and inaccurate become confusing. It was not possible to finish reading this propaganda. Why not celebrate your life and heritage be proud of who you are and respect others as your brother.
1,A book only a mental patient could love.,This book strains the First Ammendment to the breaking point.Losers who need conspiracies to explain to themselves why they're out of the mainstream of thought need look no further for confirmation.Hateful propaganda of the worst kind.
1,A COMPLETE JOKE,"This author obviously has a political and religious agenda. For anyone today to seriously believe that anyone than Muslim Arab terrorists perpetrated the most heinous terrorist incident in history is just moronic. His ""proofs"" are all worthless inuendo, and remind me of some of the nonsense I read on snopes.com. It's pretty amazing what some people will believe. For those reviewers who think this book is important, let alone factual, I've got this great bridge to sell you...Don't waste your cash on this trash!"
5,The best so far.,"Powerful, damning, shocking, well researched and indexed.Ignore the whitewash surrounding the events of 9/11 and look at all the inconsistencies on display in this book.A thinking person's alternative to Farenheit 911. Highly recommended."
3,SANTA FOR GROWNUPS,"Bought this book for my little granddaughter, but wrong choices, its more for graphic inspiration than a story."
3,cheesy hose and nozzle,"I have had this since Good Housekeeping promoted it as the best. After a few months I had drips and I used distilled water but it would leave a white powder sometimes when dripping. After a year old the dripping started to be black water which I have ruined many items. Now today, the button you press to steam with is about ready to fall out. I think I would try another brand."
2,Good for 3 years,"I used this product for 3 years- about 3-4 times a week. I would say moderate usage. I went to turn it one one day and nothing. The light was on but nothing happened so I followed the manual and cleaned the mineral deposits which I shouldn't have had and a ton of black rocks came out into my sink! Anyhow, after cleaning it out, still nothing so I'm assuming the motor/engine whatever powers the thing is dead. I won't try to get it fixed as I am done with this model. Another thing I noticed is that when I would steam garments, it would deposit black stuff on my clothes. It did come out when I washed it but really... Poorly made if you ask me. It got two stars instead of one because it do the job when it wasn't spewing black and when it worked."
2,It was nice while it lasted,"I was happy with this product when it worked, but it didn't last long enough to justify the expense (in spite of the fact that I was very careful to follow all manufacturer's instructions). It stopped working on my first morning back to school, and as a teacher/mother, I don't have time for the last minute crisis it created. I'm looking for a better one to purchase, but because I didn't get my money's worth from this one, I'm worried about spending too much for the next one."
3,steamnomore,"Great product was short lived. After 10 months, steamer button broke (also very hot). The company replaced hose and it soon began dripping out and sometimes spurting out HOT steamy water. At this time we now had it 14 months - now no longer under warranty."
1,Don't waste money.,"It looks good and stable. But from the first time use, I experienced water leaking from drain and after several time use it stopped working. It took 7 months to fail. I only used distilled water. Was this a problem?"
3,Awesome steamer...when it works,"This steamer was awesome for the first 7 months, then the button on the hose stopped working. The warranty covered the parts for a year so I was able to get a replacement hose at no cost. It is now past the 1 year point and the button on the replacement hose has stopped working and the machine is no longer covered by warranty. I'm moving on to a different brand to hopefully find some more durability."
2,"Works well, when it works...","I purchased this steamer about 1 year ago and during this time, it's worked well. Unfortunately, the auto shut off switch recently engaged (the steamer won't work) and the method of reseting it doesn't work. Thus, the steamer no longer operates. After speaking w customer service, my only option is to ship it back to the company. Perhaps I purchased a ""lemon"" but I'd recommend a different brand."
1,"Do not slow down, do not waste almost $200.00!","What a disappointment! My husband set this PIECE OF JUNK up in our guest room so I could steam our clothes. I was interested in getting a steamer because, at 34, I have arthritis and tendonitis in both hands and holding a heavy iron for extended periods of time is very painful. I turned it on, expecting to have the option to ""blast"" out tough wrinkles. What I got instead was a weak trickle of ineffective steam which only got my husband's dress shirt wet. We packed up the steamer in its box and are going to send it back! Do not waste your money on this product!"
1,Don't waste your money,"I'm a very dissatisfied customer. First of all, when the steamer arrived, the box looked as if it been handled by a gorilla. The product does not appear to be damaged, but when using it, it sprays large amounts of water all over the garments and the floor. It makes such a mess, it's not worth my time to use it. Good HouseKeeping screwed up when they put their seal on this product."
2,Cracked Heating housing in less than 2 years. Model SP-450.,I bought the model SP-460 for my wife for Christmas 2 years ago. Not sure if the model is similar as this one. But after less than 2 year the casing to the heating element cracked and corroded. I am not sure how this has happened. We only use distilled water.It is disappointing since I would have expected something this expensive to last at least 5 years before suffering this type of breakdown under the worst conditions.Not all was bad. The product produced plenty of steam and worked flawlessly before the cracked housing. Heat up time was fast. The hose and handle were cool to the touch.Unfortunately I now have a useless steamer.
4,Nice piano jazz standards,"I'm a fan of NPR's ""Wha' Do Ya Know"" and always enjoyed the show's piano jazz segments. This CD offers a very together but laid back trio playing excellent choices from the great American songbook."
5,Receiving that which is already ours,"This is a great book! When we come to understand that our heavenly Father only wants the best for us and that we as His created beings only deserve the best, then you will be Open to Receive. I pray this book lifts and movtivates you as it has me. Thank you Catherine Ponder for being open to receive the word from on high to deliver to us."
5,a must-have,"This is my 8th copy of the book. I keep giving it away to anyone who's willing to accept that we each manifest our own abundance (or lack of it) AND that the source of that abundance is not one's job! Ms. Ponder reviews this ancient knowledge in a way that is clear and accurate, and she keeps it simple. Unlike many other New Age sources of the metaphysics of manifesting (who are too concerned with making the message palatable to our pampered modern sensibilities), Ms. Ponder does not sugar-coat, and she leaves nothing out. I recommend this book highly."
5,Open Your Mind to Receive,"Christine Ponder's book Open Your Mind to Receive has been life changing for me. The simple act of repeating her many affirmations every day has opened my life to abundance in all areas of my life. The joy, peace, contentment, hope,and love I know have in my life is over the top. I call it divine magic."
3,Out of date,"I just received this and probably won't look at it much. It may have wonderful content. There are a lot of black and white p hotos and 16 color ones. It has a lot of text too, size of a coffee table book. A section on the temple, which is great. But I wish I'd paid more attention - this was published in 1975. What was I thinking? Apparently I wasn't. I'm sure there are several books published on archeological finds in Jerusalem more recently. There are several on the temple alone that I've unearthed. I guess I'll have to order another Jerusalem one - this one won't help me very much! Why this is selling for $35, I really can't imagine. I paid $5 for mine!"
5,Great Read,"I loved this book! These women express many of the same feelings I have as a mom and a wife! There is much anger, but it is tempered with much humor too. I can so identify! The other reviews discuss the specifics, but, as far as a good read, I highly recommend this book to all my friends."
2,Just OK,"According to this book, the everywoman in America is a neurotic, passive agressive professional writer. While I'll grant that the stories were interesting and did ring true for me in some aspects, I ended up just being annoyed that the editor failed to seek out more diverse women with more diverse professions for her book. Couldn't she have found an engineer, a black woman, a Latina to chronicle their stories? Hanauer started out with lofty goals in her introduction, but didn't end up meetig them for me."
2,no sympathy here.,"This book sounded like it would be terrific -- women talking about things women tend not to discuss. However, it wasn't at all what I expected. The contributors are mainly upper-middle-class magazine writers, which means that the pieces all tend to sound the same, and have a real feeling of entitlement. Too, there are almost no older women/women of color/etc.I actually preferred THE BASTARD ON THE COUCH, because the men seemed a lot more dimensional than their wives (if as shallow)."
3,"interesting bookclub piece, not much on literary accolades","The book was interesting, but not something I would necessarily recommend. I give kudos to the author, for the inclusive of differing women's perspectives-broadening the readers minds! This is not a narrowly focused piece of chick lit, that bashes all men, but a book that looks at what causes female bitterness. Some woman take responsiblity, some don't. A lot like real life. Wake up, girls! We make our own beds...., or couches- as the author's husband touts."
4,Good Read,"It is a social commentary of our times. It was honest and the best part is that it is not patronizing. It does not tell me what is wrong with my life, rather it shares the experiences of women who are struggling to balance being a wife, a mother and a (successful?) career."
2,Don't Spend The Money,"While I agree that the essays were well-written and interesting, I have to agree with the reviewer who wrote that this book was annoying and ""the women made their bed now lie in it"".Maybe because I'm not married and don't have children, I can say that I do not understand their frustrations but this is obviously the path they chose. My advice to the authors is GROW UP!!! Who said life is easy?"
3,some good stories amoung these,"I am a single girl who is 24 and live with my boyfriend. I was initially attracted to this book because I started reading the stories about single woman, and i thought they were cute and interesting. As I have many of the same issues they did. As I dove deeper into the book, I realized it was only ok and I couldn't really identify with some of the women who were older and had kids. However I still thought it was interesting to see how different upper middle class view the world. Everyone has their own problems."
2,A tree gave its life?,"A tree gave its life for this book? Give me a break! As a woman, I take offense to others who cannot look at the sunny side of life! This sets women back 100 years."
3,Insight on the far side,"Follow other reviewers' advice and read this book in installments.Maybe a chapter or two per sitting. Nice before bedtime.The book provides insight into the 'weaker' sex.It confirmed most of my bigoted masculine suspicions,but I give women more credit than this book allows.The authors explain their self centered rage but areunable to justify it. Many women are more successful atavoiding their perfectionistic, blame-others perspective.(Blaming mom? -- gimme a break!)"
1,Unsatisfying,"With a few exceptions, this book is a collection of essays by cranky women. I found many of the essays to be completely embarrassing. Some of the writers must have felt that way too, because they wrote under a pseudonym. What is it with writers, anyway? It seems as though they have all been in therapy, can't commit, and complain about the most superficial things. One woman complained about the fact that her boyfriend wouldn't spring for imported cheese. She made a good living and felt she was entitled to imported cheese. Several women claimed to love their independence, but then complained about the lack of a man in their lives, and then finished up by admitting to having pushed away anyone who expressed an interest. What do these women want? This book was unsatisfying and I am sorry I wasted my time reading it. Good riddance."
2,waste of time to read,"This book was a waste of time for three reasons.First, I have enough stress in my life and I don't need to hear or read about the stress of other women. I have to do a lot of reading as it is and don't need to come home to do more reading from women who couldn't cut it.Second, if you want to stop being a b.... then take a vacation or take some time out to just do nothing. You don't need to read this book to realize that. Usually when we take a step back from our life we can put things in a larger perspective and move on.Third, these women are too stuck on themselves. If you feel you have to experience the problems of others to help yourself, volunteer at a non-profit -- that way you'll see real world problems and be helping someone else at the same time."
2,Bitch and whine,"All these essays are fairly interchangeable. All the women seem to be white professionals, all left-leaning academics/writers griping about their complicated lives. There's a sameness to all their narratives; even the one by Ellen Gilchrist, a writer I admire, is suprisingly flat. No humor, no variety, no lightness of touch anywhere--just the self-absorbed ruminations of spoiled, earnest women who've bought the line that they can,and deserve, to have it all."
5,Made me feel normal!,"Okay, so I'm feeling a little bitchy in my life right now, trying to keep it all together as a working professional, loving wife, and mom to two young boys. Yep, just a bit bitchy right now... just a teeny, tiny bit. And so it was a delightful emotional release to see that I'm NOT THE ONLY ONE out there who feels like this. That maybe I'm just a normal woman trying to get along in life, encouraged by the brave admissions of these women. From the first essay to the last, I felt like I was at a dinner party where we'd all just dropped our social masks and admitted how we really felt."
2,This is feminism?,"I bought this book after reading a review that suggested it would be essays about how various women cope with jobs, kids, husbands, etc. Since I'm one of those women, I thought it my might affirm my own experiences, or maybe enlighten me to new ways to approach various problems. Nope. These women seemed to be whiny, upper-middle class women who are very proud of their intellectual accomplishments, give their husbands no credit whatsoever, and are very angry that their husbands aren't mind readers. Some of them also seemed pretentious. I mean, although some of the reasons one woman gave against marriage were perfectly valid in the abstract, can anyone really say ""marriage is a tool of the patriarchy"" with a straight face?"
3,I'm not alone,"The main reason I wanted to read this book is because it sounded very rebellous to me. ""Yea to women who say they're fed up with how they're treated,"" I thought. But, as others have said, this book had a very repetative feel to it, and all the women (except two) come from the same background and live the same type of life. Few stories actually spoke to me the way I'd hoped, but I still enjoyed reading it for the sheer ""I'm not alone"" feeling it gave me. I enjoyed reading other women saying some of the things I thought. True, I couldn't identify with most of the stories about children, since I don't have any, but they were still semi-entertaining to read. And even though I identified with only parts of some of the stories, my favorite part was saying, ""Wow - at least I'm not that crazy."""
4,Sanity Check...,"I read this book on the recommendation of my best friend: It didn't disappoint!I LOVED the variety of the book, and the different viewpoints were comforting in that I found things to identify with in nearly every essay, which always helps to give you the 'I'm NOT the only person who feels like this and maybe I still have my sanity!' feeling. I found it thought-provoking, comforting, funny, insightful, and sometimes irritating.This isn't a curl-up-and-read-by-the-fire book, however. No matter how much you might identify, reading this like a standard novel can wear thin on your attention span and, frankly, your nerves. This is a great 30-minute at a time read, or before-bedtime read.And just imagine the non-verbal value of someone seeing THIS in your bookshelf!"
1,Pitiful,"Thank you, Ladies, for writing this book. You are exactly why I will never marry an American woman and why I have advised my nephews and younger brother the same.I was exhausted halfway through the thing. While I had dealt with my divorce, this book has kindled in me something I would never have expected concerning my divorce from the woman whose very breath I loved. That something is nothing less than ecstatic joy at being free from being tied to an American woman.Hard, driven, cold, lacking natural affection for their own children, often focused on proving they are as sexually active as a man would like to be, LOL, as if that is a good thing these women portray the American woman as totally devoid of affection or morals.Don't worry ladies about committment, no one would want you for more than an evening's distraction anyway."
2,What about the children?,"Madam's whiny book ignores natural law, as well as the time-space continuum. What? One can't work a full-time, professional career, have mentally healthy children, and be a super-mom? How disappointing!"
3,"Pretty good, mostly","Modern married women will relate to this thoughtful anthology of personal essays. Organized roughly by the age of the authors, The Bitch in the House covers a plethora of issues and decisions facing women today including working or not, marrying or not, having children or not, and how these decisions impact their lives. Although the pace did sag a bit in the middle, altogether it is a fine read. My favorite is the opening essay, ""Excuse Me While I Explode,"" about a young newly-mated woman who finds herself helplessly falling into the same trap she perceives to have held her mother hostage: both resentful and proud about being more domestically competent than her partner."
2,Whiny self-indulgent women bitch and moan,"I am betting they are all alone now if they haven't grown up. Except maybe the Indian one. The 1-3 star reviewers hit the nail on the head. Only a saint or a masochist could tolerate their whiny crap. Read it if you need to get depressed. These 'ladies' don't want partners, they want mind-reading fairy-tale man-slaves to cater to their every whim. And even then they wouldn't be satisfied. I feel for the men in (probably no longer) their self-centered lives."
4,The essays ran the gamut,"I read this book for book club and the essays ran the gamut from being just like who I am or women I knew, to women I couldn't even understand. It was a fun and easy read and gave us a lot to talk about at book club."
1,Save your money,"The book is a total waste of money. But at least the title is appropripate. It seems to perfectly classify the writers. The stories are negative, whiny and depressing. I do not have time for this kind of garbage! The stories are far from uplifting. I bought the book after reading some positive reviews. I thought that I would purchase the book and share it with my friends and daughters, maybe even buy them a copy. I don't know anyone that I care about that I would give the book to. Save your money."
3,I have to agree....,"this book really was very shallow in its observations. I was hoping for a more diverse selection of authors, as well. Its really no surprise that it did so well and became a national best seller- its very digestable for most of America."
4,Betty needs a bit of better bitter,"I thoroughly enjoyed this collection of first-person essays in the beginning, but as I read more I found, as several other readers seem to have found, that these women's experiences were too similar to enjoy reading over and over. There is not much diversity of culture, race or age. Still, I did enjoy the humor and the sharing, and thought the writing was very good. Ultimately I did realize that I am not as angry, not as bitter, not as disappointed as these authors, though I did enjoy the writing, and would recommend it to others."
3,Too happy to enjoy this?,"A friend had raved to me about this book. ""You'll really feel like you can identify with so much of what these women write about!"" While I don't disagree with that (because there were a lot of feelings and emotions that ALL mothers and wives must feel at some point), I found this collection of essays to be mostly depressing. Even though feelings of resentment, jealousy, despair, inadequacy, etc. haunt me from time to time (as they do with these women), I guess that I overcome them radically faster than they do - and mercifully so! If the point of the book is to validate women with ""You're not alone,"" then it does this well. But it does it with a negative, almost spiteful, undertone that I found distatsteful."
1,HORRIBLE,MOST TERRIBLE MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN! THERE WAS NO PLOT TO THE MOVIE. THERE WAS NOT EVEN ONE SHOT IN THE MOVIE. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!
3,A bit slow,"This movie describes the war in Iraq, how the Marines behave and the problems they face. However it is a bit slow and sometimes tedious."
5,Ignore the bad reviews this movie is great!,I so can't wait to get the DVD. I thought the movie was excellent. Jamie Foxx and Jake Gyllennhaal does an excellent job. I would recommened to see this movie. I saw it twice in the theater and I love it.
1,tc,"The bottom line for me, a retired Marine, is that this movie is an insult to all Marines. Unfortunatly due to location I purchase my movies... this one is for traget practice as I will never watch it again and would not want to pass it on to anyone."
3,Interesting Perspective Not Enough,"What Jarhead did right is that it finally filled the void of a new brand of war movie. The genre has lacked originality since the release of Saving Private Ryan. Sadly, this unique approach to war and wartime was not enough to save the mediocre acting, directing, and screenplay that was Jarhead. It is too bad that a better filmaker didn't have the opportunity to make this movie. It could have been a masterpiece."
4,A likeable movie,"I have watched numerous war films and seriosly thought there would be some kind of enemy battle in the second part of this film.. nothing! This is certainly different for a blockbuster. Another thing, is at times it had a documentary feel to it; which is fine by me. The main thing is that everything worked out well with the good news that they(troops)were going back home. That was reason enough for them to celebrate, drink some booze and be thankfull; good for all of them!"
4,"Pretty good, but the book is better","After reading the Jarhead book, I was unsure how good the movie would be. The book is full of personal thoughts and feelings about how the Marine feels in combat and just being a Marine. The movie follows the basic events of the book, minus the personal feelings and thoughts. Anthony Swofford (a former AF brat) enlists in the Marines and is subsequently sent to Desert Storm. The movie chronicles his life and the war there. I enjoyed the movie, but I was glad to have read the book. It helped to fill in some holes in the story, especially the ending. Overall, a good movie, but a better book."
2,USMC Deserves Better than This,"TEDIOUS - I could not finish watching this film. My husband, a former Marine Infantry Officer, rented it. This movie tried to be an update of Full Metal Jacket with Swofford as the Joker character. It fails except in its stereotypical portrayal of Marines as a bunch of sexually obsessed, masturbating loosers. Puhlease. A decent soundtrack but a waste of time. Watch Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket instead - a better soundtrack.Save your money."
4,GET THE MOVIE AND LEARN FROM IT,"Jarhead is a great movie that takes a look at human nature and the psyche of our mind. The only real war we are fight is our self. The young man in the movie comes to realize that. There no real enemy it just people killing people. I never been in the military, I don't know what happen during Golf war and Hollywood has sensationalize the event taking place in the movie, but I think there is some truth to the movie. War is war and Hollywood will keep making war movies until there are no more wars. If you do not like this movie is because you are lying to yourself."
3,Jog My Memory,"If you are expecting a smash 'em up, blow 'em up movie then you will be let down. Why do we have the mindset anyway that all war movies have to have non-stop action. No, this not a great movie nor is it a classic. However, it is a decent movie with some excellent acting and decent storyline to hold your attention.If memory serves me right, much of Desert Shield deployment was just what we have here in the storyline......mundane. That's not to say there was no action during the first round with Saddam it just wasn't overly exciting. And, to dress it up to be something that it was not does not do honor to the brave men and women who served during that deployment."
3,I assume the book is better,"Never read the memoir, but they say the movie is just like it. However, the print version is probably more entertaining. There's drama in the movie, just not very involving such as when Jake G goes nuts and almost shoots a fellow Marine, or when one of Jake's buddy's goes nuts when he is not allowed to fire a sniper shot at a distant Iraqi. I felt nothing during those scenes. This is a combo of old-fashioned Marine boot camp cliches and a somewhat updated take on what it was like to be a GI in the first Gulf War. It made me realize the U.S. has been wasting its time over there for almost 20 years now."
1,The jar is empty...,"This plodding film attempts to ""shock and awe"" the viewer with its depiction of the U.S. Marines as unstable, anti-social, bloodthirsty thugs, and tries to impugn the United States' actions in Operation Desert Storm as motivated by oil company profit.I realize the viewer is supposed to be shocked by the scene in which the soldiers are hooting and hollering with excitement while watching a violent scene from Apocalypse Now, but all I was thinking was how much I'd rather be watching that movie too, instead of this dismal wreck.For a much better look at the dark, disturbing side of the American military, watch Apocalpyse Now, Full Metal Jacket, or even Three Kings. Don't waste your time here."
3,Not Bad,"I like this movie and I feel it was good for Jake Gyllenhale to do, but I usually don't like military movies"
4,Interesting Movie,"Too bad HD-DVD is dead, but if you still own a player, this is a great movie for the price. I think those of us who are soldiers and have been to Iraq can understand this movie a little better than those who haven't. Some of the scences can be too close to home and somewhat overbearing for non-military viewers, but helps to remind us how much of a sacrifice we made in both wars. The picture quality and sound delivers, though this more of an enhanced DVD than a true HD movie."
4,good,"good movie, based on true \\ story. i recommend to watch it. not a war movie just about experiences of one man"
2,The most boring war/military movie I've ever seen,"Jarhead follows Jake Gyllenhall through marine bootcamp, through training as a sniper and being sent to Kuwait in the first Gulf War. We watch him get chewed out, worry about his girlfriend cheating on him, fight and party with his marine brothers, go crazy with boredom in the desert and finally get to go on a mission.If all that sounds boring, it is. Nothing interesting happens in this movie. It's 70 minutes into it before the war even begins and then, still nothing happens. Even when he finally gets a mission, it's dull. The scope of this movie tries to be a Full Metal Jacket for the Gulf War generation but fails in the sheer pointlessness of the story."
2,One Of The Worst War Movies,This is one of the worst war movies that I've ever seen.Pretty boring and there was no plot and no character development.There was no point to this movie.Not much going on so the movie dragged.In the begining it looks like it might be a decent movie but it quickly went down hill.
5,Great service Great movie,Great movie the acting was top notch. The service was the best I actually got Jarhead two days earlier than expected.
5,Marine's best friend,"Reminds me of what I go through on a day to day basis as a Marine, great movie. Recommend if you're a fellow Marine trying to explain what a life of a Marine is, just pop this movie in and watch it."
3,"Not Bad, but Not Great either","Jarhead describes Desert Shield and Desert Storm operations through the eyes of a US Marine sniper.In short, the music, the setting and the acting are pretty good, while the plot is interesting. Nevertheless, the characters are not that likable, the dialogues could have been better, and it lacks that extra something to put it over the top.In a nutshell, it's probably not a movie you would want to add to your collection, but it might provide for an evening's entertainment, and that's about it; No masterpiece here."
4,Surprisingly good.,"I didn't have high expectations for this movie because of all the mixed reviews, but I am hungry for HD material so I watched it. It turned out to be a pleasent surprise-realistic story, good acting, good dialogue. However, don't expect to see a war movie with lots of combat action-most of the movie takes place during the buildup prior to the Gulf War. Also, while the boot camp portion of the movie is good, it can't compare to Full Metal Jacket. The HD DVD transfer is one of the better ones and the sound is top notch as well. Recommended."
3,Marine Life on Display!,"I thought that this was a pretty good movie and that it was a good adaptation of the book and stayed very true to it. This movie exposes that brain washing and homoerotic culture of the American Military. It also shows the truth behind the everyday life of the basic Marine during desert storm. It might not be what you expect in that the action is few and far between. But it also has a ton of the basic war movie stuff that you have seen in every war movie since The Boys from Company C.Still a good movie and worth watching, check it out!"
2,dissapointing,"Unfortunately I was dissapointed by Jarhead. This is mainly due to the action packed previews I saw and loved so much. As far as I can tell the previews contined almost every second in the film that contained a gun being fired or an explosion. This lead me to believe there would be a lot of action in the movie.I was also dissapointed by the fact that the scene's in boot camp were plucked straight from Full Metal Jacket. The dialogue althought true to live was un-original.I love movies about the first gulf war, of which there are only a few (Courage under fire, Three Kings, Bravo Two Zero). I could not wait to see the movie and ultimately my excitement about it probably led to me disliking it more as a result. However it was ultimately the previews that portrayed the movie as action packed that were the biggest let down."
5,Best film this year,"this movie is based on the memoirs of Anthony Swafford, a soldier in the first gulf war, so to say that it is unoriginal just doesn't make sense. it tells of the marines going insane while waiting for the war to start, and then going insane waiting to fight. when the war did start, the air support took out most of the republican guard, saddam's army. the fact that they did not die in remote places should not take away from their honor. and the soldiers who fought in vietnam did have problems when they came back. if you're ignorant enough that you need violence to enjoy a movie, maybe try something else. the acting is great, with many oscar winners. as for the language, if you dont like the f word, maybe dont see this movie. however, realize that it is war, and that you hear the same language everyday.this movie is very entertaining. the performances are awesomely powerful. highly recommended"
3,JarHead gets an OO-RAH!,"Jaky Gyllenhaal (Brokeback Mountain, Highway) stars as Anthony Swoffard who is in the deserts of Saudi Arabia where he is being trained by Sgt. Sykes played by Jamie Foxx (Ray, Collateral), to get ready for the on coming war. Swofford becomes a sniper and his spotter is Troy, played by Peter Sarsgaard (Skeleton Key, Shattered Glass). Darkly funny and some scenes with power make JarHead interesting and the direction is amazing, be it explosions or soldiers walking along burnt cars or oil fields at night on fire with is scary and beautiful at the same time. Also starring Chris Cooper (Capote, October Sky), Jacob Vargas (Nexy Friday, Traffic), Lucas Black (Crazy In Alabama, Sling Blade) and Dennis Haysbert (Tv's 24, Absolute Power) They got refrences from The Deer Hunter, Apocalypse Now and Giant with James Dean. Gyllenhaal gives one of his best performances so far, Sarsgaard is explosive and Jamie Foxx digs out of the BOMB pit that was the movie Stealth. ""Welcome to the Suck!"""
1,What a crappy movie!,This is really not a war movie it's more like marinees training and searching for something in the desert storm. They picked Jake Gyllennhaal to be Anthony Swofford? He looked horrible for the part and looked like a pussy and I hate Jake Gyllennhaal too his acting is terrible. Why Donnie Darko being in the role of Jarhead? He's really a strange actor. This movie was really too long and I was bored with it. I was ready to leave during the middle of it. It was more like a rip off of Full Metal Jacket. You will be disappointed. The trailers looked amazing but the movie sucked ass. Don't waste your money!
1,Really wants to be Apocalypse Now...,"If you want a war move that probes the depths of madness and incorporates surerealism while exploring the lives of soldiers trapped in a pointless microcosm of a wider war, you have two options. Get a pretty lame and boring variation on this theme in Jarhead, or get Apocalypse Now. The later is the infinitely better choice."
1,What an awful movie!,If you want to see a war movie without any action in it then go ahead. I didn't see any action at all. They are mainly just training at war and searching for something in desert storm. If you want to see it that bad then wait for the DVD but don't go waste money to see it in theater. The actors did a great job and everything. I especially liked Jake Gyllennhaal's performance as Anthony Swofford he did an excellent job and so did Jamie Foxx but the whole movie just sucked. Do not waste two hours watching this movie it's a complete waste of time. I felt like I was watching a rerun of Full Metal Jacket but anyways you will be disappointed do not see it!
3,Mediocrity as art,"In Okinawa in WW2 the Marines lost 7.547 men over ten days taking a small rise called Sugar Loaf Hill. Many times 40 or 50 went up and two came back....For the marines the Gulf War was a pseudo war. And this not a war movie. If you are expecting a new Apocalypse Now, you'll be disappointed. Perhaps I am just getting old but all this is are one man's common and petty grumbles about his chosen profession (grumbles being that its hard, at times boring, and there's a hierachy in place, not exactly earth shattering revelations) directed by a man who hates American capitalism (American Beauty) and now, apparently, the American military."
2,should have been better than this!!!!!!!,"i give this mess two stars for the try at something meaningful here,but they missed the boat! jake gyllenhaal and jamie fox are good but the screenplay is underwritten and the movie is just not up to the task of telling it's first gulf war story. the action is few and far between and what passes as development of the charters is just not worth the time you have to spend watching this foulball movie."
2,Wannabe war movie,"This is a dull movie that would have been better as a series of shorts. The whole thing goes back and forth between ""humorous"" and ""serious"" scenes, and you're never really sure what the movie is supposed to be about. You never care about any of the characters either - most of them are portrayed as drooling idiots when they're not spouting off dialogue that sounds like it was created by some sort of generic army talk generator. Worst of all is the soundtrack. Everybody Dance Now? Are you kidding me? It's like listening to a mixed tape made by someone who owns every volume of Now: The Hits.Jarhead tries too hard to be deep, with its trippy visuals of burning oil wells and dramatic naratives, but by the time the film is over, absolutely nothing is said. Jarhead is just a wannabe war movie that even references Apocalypse Now and The Deer Hunter while ripping off Full Metal Jacket. Too bad because a good cast was wasted."
3,Different kind of action,"This movie isn't the kind of action that you'd regularly expect from a war movie. But, that doesn't mean that it isn't a good movie. There are a lot of symbols and if you can think deeply about how it would be to wait for someone to bomb you or sneak up on you while you sleep, think of the stress you would be under and thats what this movie is about. If you're looking for action you will find little here but if you're just looking for a good movie about soldiers and their troubles you'll find it here."
2,A Mom's Opion...,"I ordered this for my son & I watched it the other day & I won't go into long details seeing there are plenty already,there are a few pretty funny bit's & some naked Butt shot's which was ok by me,but I must say it wasn't what I expected it to be,if U can get it for a buck or less it might be good just for a few laughs as long as U don't mind hearing the word Masturbation about 50 times.."
1,I've seen better,"This movie left me with a lot to be desired. No I wasn't looking for a lot of action and if that's what you're looking for, look for another movie. I didn't care for the storyline, I didn't think there was much of anything there. I didn't care for the acting. And back to the storyline, I felt there was a lot that was missing. I'm delighted that I didn't waste my money at the theater!! I am proud of the troops that were there in Desert Storm, along with the troops before and after that, however I feel like this movie was capitalizing solely on what is going on in the middle east right now! Thus why I think the studio released it, otherwise I don't think they would have bothered!!"
1,Was bad just like i expected,I dotn really like war movies but I did like We where soliders and some other ones but I am nt a fan of them. Right when this movie came out I knew it would be bad and not good but people said it was good and some people said it was bad so i ahd to see and I was right it was bad. The story shows the bad parts of joing the army and how people lose loved one's for example the men all think there wives are cheating on them and they lose there wives as they have affairs and then they take there children away. The movie shows how you become brainwashed into fighting while your out in the field and sometimes nothing happends liek this movie and then they show how the men get all mad. The acting was the only good part of the movie the story boring the directing bad for an ocsar winner. Overall dont waste your time you'll be wondering where my 2 hours went.
1,jarhead,"i have always been a big fan of this movie...the grittiness and the uglyness of war seems to be captured...it almost feels as if it is a documentary, but we know its not. for people like myself who did not get to serve our country, it give us a chance to see how the marines live, eat and protect our wonderful country. a must see for any war buff, jake gyllenhall or jamie fox fan!"
2,Wierd.......,to have have a movie about a war that is happening right now. Don't get me wrong I enjoy war movies. But most of them are about WWII. I don't like being reminded of people in Irag and Kuwait actually dying as we speak. I sensed this movie was a little bit too pro war. It's just my opinion. The casting was great but the movie wasn't.
1,THIS WON'T WORK!,Jarhead is clearly an UNSUCCESSFUL attempt to embarass Marines and former Marines. The mission is to deter those interested in serving their country from enlisting in the Marine Corps. Don't support this anti-Marine Corps sentiment. Don't buy the book or a movie ticket.
3,Just another Hollywood blockbuster,"Lets face it You cant go into the cinema anymore and find a movie worth the 10 bucks you just spent. Jarhead is another example of where the trailer is 10 times better than the film. I did walk out of this movie and I never usually do, but this was a real snooze fest. The fact that this director made American Beauty is amazing. What Jarheads did do well was kind of show what it feels like inside your head during war, but just watch your copy of Apocolypse Now again if you wanna see that. It also had some pretty good cinematography. Anyway so far after American Beauty Sam Mendes is a whopping 0 for 2 with Road To Perdition and Jarhead."
3,"Decent movie, but not great.","If you're going into this movie hoping for another ""Full Metal Jacket"" examination of a war, you will probably be disappointed. I'd heard great things about the book that inspired this movie, but as a film, it just doesn't stand out."
2,Your off your jarhead if you liked this movie,"For one thing, I don't like to see a war movie without the war! Next, after 21 years in the military with several male-bonding opportunities, including forty years as an avid athlete showering with teammates, I NEVER had a homo-erotic thought! The less-than-one-percent of our population that sways that way obviously includes the author, Swofford. I also figure the buddies in his unit are a might uncomfortable reading his book. Otherwise, the movie was well-acted and well-done."
1,Save Your Money!,"This movie is a big disappointment when it comes to a portrayal of what it means to be a Marine. As a former Marine, I found it insulting and to say the least lame. The film portrayed marines as being a group of adolescents whose sole activity consisted of masturbation. Whoever wrote the sript obviously had no idea of what it was to be a Marine. The casting of Foxx as a Staff sergeant whose vocabulary consisted of one word, which is unprintable here, was the pitts. If you want to see what it was like in the old days, then see ""Full Metal Jacket"" or the ""D.I."", those were the good old days when they separated the men from the boys in the first 3 days."
3,Good Idea bad execution,I liked the movie mainly because it remided be of full meadal jacket with out the combat. I was hopping for a more emersive film but I fell asleep after about 50 min. This movie a rental.
1,Pathetic Waste of Video,I'll keep this short. This movie is awful. I found myself ripping it out of my DVD player after 20 minutes! Never done that before and I've watched some horrible movies. The Marine Corps this movie portrays is NOT anywhere near real. To think I spent hard earned money to own this junk ticks me off more!
1,NO PLOT!,"This may well have been a documentary of marine life, but to make a movie, it requires you have a plot. A definite purpose to the story. There WAS NO STORY! The lead character shed no blood, saw no action, except for the sex with his girlfriend, and the only time he fired his weapon was during TARGET PRACTICE! There, now you know the entire jist of the movie and you were not bored to death for two hours like I was!"
1,welcome to the suck,"I asked myself. Why? This movie has no plot, no character development, and nothing to hold interest. This was a waste of my life. Please save yourself and dont ever watch this movie. Ever!"
1,Terrible Movie,"When I first saw this movie, I thought, ""This is so stupid."" There was no plot at all. All the guys do is hang out at camp and run around the desert. The never even shoot at an enemy. Not ONE SINGLE SHOT. It's also a rip off of Stanley Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket. Jarhead even copied Full Metal Jacket's lines. If you go to rent a war movie, and you come across Jarhead, spit on the box and rent a different movie."
1,Embarrassments all round.,"Where to begin with a film so full of verbal and visual clichés? Taken from Swofford's cynical memoirs, Mendes goes to town with the usual ""grunts as foul mouthed dupes thrown into war by capitallists"" routine. The language is gratuitous except to convey how Hollywood thinks recruits and PFCs behave. Drill sergeants have long been prevented from slapping recruits but here we go again with scenes showing the supposed brutality of the system.Mendes thought he had the raw material for a great war movie. He doesn't. And it looks like he gave up trying halfway, throwing around liberal and literal plagiarisms from Apocalypse Now, Three Kings, Full Metal Jacket, The Hill and Deer Hunter. It's pathetic.For the acting, Chris Cooper phones his performance in and Dennis Haysbert wanders in from another movie. Only Peter Sarsgaard emerges with any credit. An actor to watch for but not in this nonsense."
3,Amazon purchased. Excellent customer service and delivery,Description is more exciting than movie turned out to be. Been there done it. Not appealing if you are interested in military movies. Less than close to accurate. In some ways degrades our service men.
2,The Supplemental Disc is better,I give this dvd 2 stars only because of the second disc. Does anyone know where the boot camp footage on the supplemental disc came from?
1,Agitprop,"This film is a dark portrayal of the U.S. Marine Corps as seen through the eyes of Hollywood. The movie starts off negative and continues down the path of resentment and disdain toward the first Gulf war. The producers of this emotional diatribe want the public to assume the same bitterness they hold for the war and the military in general.Hollywood has been called the entertainment capitol of the world, but this is not entertainment. It is however a waste of time and money. Anthony Swofford's disaffected view of his military experience is a personal tragedy but not one that needs to be reiterated in a public forum."
2,For Jarheads,"I too wasn't very impressed with Jarhead. I thought half way through that Jarhead seemed more like an insider movie for those who actually experienced the Marines, and perhaps other branches of the military. For those of us who haven't I just don't think there was enough direction to keep a lot of us interested. As someone else mentione. I too thought it was going to be a more modern version of Full Metal Jacket, but afte the first few minutes it was obvious it wasn't..."
1,Jarhead,"Don't waste your time on yet another poorly made, plotless, pointless, Hollywood Left propaganda movie. Bad acting and a slap in the face to the military."
4,the review for jarhead by michael aster,it was funny and good i liked the slapstick comedy in it i was laughing my ass of in there
2,Ollie North said it sucks,"Well, Lt.Col North didn't actually use the word 'sucks.' But he said it was a waste of his money, and he extorted his listeners to save 2 hours of their life. He actually had hoped it would portray Marines in a good light, but said he found nothing redeeming about this movie."
1,Jarhead worst war movie ever,"This is the worst war movie ever made. It is full of every idiot cliché that could be crammed into a movie of this type. The private standing up and getting machine gunned in training is a vey old stick. Fact is that I've done the old low crawl across the course while machine guns fired overhead and small charges of C-4 were set off and I did it at night. It's more ""fun"" that way. Didn't anybody panic. And no, we were not elite soldiers - just a bunch of ordinary guys going through Army basic in 1963. That sadistic staff sergeant in movie - what a crock. Yes, there are Army and Marine sergeants who are tough on the people they command. However, the actions of the staff sergeant in the movie was so far out of realty as to be pathetic. About the only good part of this movie were the scenes of ""grab ass"" and the stress of doing nothing. The rest of it was pure male bovine droppings and a disservice to the marines. Frankly, I wouldn't wish this movie on my worst enemy."
4,Good movie!,"This movie is pretty good.It has action, comedy, and some drama.I enjoyed watching it and I am glad that I purchased it."
3,"Good, not great","If you're looking for another Saving Private Ryan, keep looking. This movie was more designed to show the emotional anguish that comes from being away from your family for nearly a year, and all of the psychological effects that come from anticipating being shot at on a daily basis. The battle scenes are few and far between, but you seem to get a snap shot of how sitting around waiting and waiting and training and waiting takes it's toll on you. Many questions are left unanswered but it seems like a pretty realistic sample of a person's life who has been through a lot. Hard to rate it higher than a 3 though due to the multiple slow parts. Great sound track!"
3,Jarhead,"Oh, look! it's two hours of half naked buffed up actors yelling at each other, dancing in tents, slapping each other on the chest and laughing and singing and sweating and being annoying. I understand that's the point of this film, but it gets boring. Especially when we're dealing with the ever-hard-to-look at Jake G. I usually gag when Jamie Foxx shows up in movies, but he was the least-bad thing about this one. It's worth a casual look since it is a very well made movie, just don't expect anything other than yelling, singin, dancing men in tents."
5,fiya..,"Niggas ain't ready. This compilation is hott, with a lot of new talent coming up in the game. Manifest's DIP IT LOW is a hot first bangin track, an inevitable head nod. Reef Hustle is also nice."
2,groggy!,"I have used this product for a week now. I am groggy in the AM!! It has helped me to sleep, but not solidly every night. I may try valerian root for insomnia."
1,Does not work for me.,"I am going through my change and cannot take hormones. This product did not help me sleep; it made me stay awake all night long. By the end of the week I was one tired and miserable person. I ended up throwing the rest out. It may work on some people, but it did not work on me. So ladies, be careful of any product. Valerian root helps me sleep all night long and it is a lot cheaper. I do not take it all the time."
5,This is a great book that's fun to read,"After several years as a reporter, I switch to teaching journalism. My duties included advising the student newspaper. It was obvious the students needed help with the design, but I didn't know a thing about the subject.A friend in the business recommended this book. I bought it and used the exercises in the editing class. The students loved it and their enthusiasm showed in their assignments. This year, the book is a required text.If you don't know anything about newspaper design, buy this book. The spiral binding means you can lay it on the desk next to your computer, and refer to it while you work.Plus Harrower's wacky sense of humor makes the concepts easy to learn and remember."
5,"This book gives designers an ""Edge""",This book makes sense of the often conflicting and confusing suggestions made by on-staff design advisers. I wish I would have had this book when I was editing a major metropolitan newspaper's lifestyle section!
5,Newspaper Design Bible,"All I have to say is, if you want to know what the big deal about Tim Harrower is, just check out the Oregonian. He's a genius! The Oregonian and USA Today are the two prime examples of journalistic perfection in America today."
3,Good for non-designers,"I'm a magazine designer and want to get into newspaper design; while Harrower's book has some great examples, he's much too dogmatic when it comes to design principles, to the point of grievously underestimating the intelligence of newspaper readers. For that reason, I wouldn't recommend this for anyone who's already a design professional."
5,Good text for students,"I use this book to teach page design to my high school journalism and yearbook students. Middle school students could also benefit from this book. However, it is not limited to 6-12 education. Any person who needs to know about layout would be well served by this book.Furthermore, the resources available on the CD-ROM are outstanding. Chapter quizzes, self tests, photo cropping examples, crossword puzzles, and more really make this book stand out. The disc also links to the McGraw-Hill website which offers even more content to supplement the book.Overall, a terrific resource for journalists, designers, teachers, and students."
5,Colorful and Informative,"This spiral-bound text is an interesting, colorful, and informative introduction to the principles of newspaper design. It describes the elements and fundamental principles of page layout, including how to lay out pages with varying numbers of columns, in broadsheet and tabloid formats, with or without photographs. The text is amply illustrated with numerous full-color illustrations of various techniques, showing both good and bad examples. Fun to read and a nifty reference."
5,Best in its field,"My only regret about this book its that it wasn't the text used in my copy editing and page design class many years ago. It's tops in its field, whether you're a student, practicing page designer (it doesn't matter the size of your newspaper) or just curious about more on the newspaper biz. Highly recommended."
2,Cheaply made but serviceable...,"This small safe is very cheaply made and does not sit upright on a shelf; it must lay flat (unlike the photo). It works, but I agree with others why do not trust the construction and/or the safety of a firearm locked inside."
5,HIGHLY RECOMMENDED,"This is a great pistol safe; easy to set up, quick to get into. The size is just right, not too big but big enough for small pistol. Very much worth the price I paid."
3,Eh...,"It's okay. Easy to break into with a screwdriver. Not a secure gun safe!!! It is what it says, quick access safe."
1,All Around Terrible Product,"I was skeptical about buying a box with an electronic lock, but since it had external 9V battery contacts I decided to go with this one. That is great and all, unless the lock returns to it's default code. I lost the paperwork (which had the factory code) over the course of the year that I owned this. My bad, but I maintain that the real fault lies in a product that randomly resets it's code even with a fully functioning battery.A cat's claw, a screw driver, and about two minutes later I was able to retrieve my handgun. This product is not a safe (nor does HOMAK advertise it as one). It may keep your 5 year old away from your handguns, but it won't deter a thief. It is very simple to break into, which turned out to be a good thing so I could get my gun back.Stay away from this product. It is worse than useless."
3,fatal flaw - dead battery in an emergency,"The problem with this safe is the electronic lock. If the batteries die, or if the circuit is interrupted by something inside the safe bumping up against the battery holder (such as a pistol, box of ammo or flashlight) then the safe ""reverts"" to its factory set default code. This has happened to me several times during the two years I have owned this safe - fortunately not in an emergency situation! You must then find the instruction manual, find a 9 volt battery, enter the factory code to open the safe, fix the loose battery and go through the moderately-complicated process of resetting a custom code. I recommend spending a little more money for a reliable mechanical-lock pistol safe."
1,Died upon arrival,"My wife bought me this model for Christmas. It was recommended by a friend. It looks good and all, but I installed the batteries, input my code twice like it said and everything looked good according to the manual. I closed the lid and it latched just fine. Then I tried inputting my code again and... nothing. No lights. No nothing. I tried the external contacts and it opened using the default code. I took it back to the retailer where I bought it. The guy there tried fresh batteries but could not get it to work.I'm not saying they're all bad. I'm sure lots of people find them to be exemplary products, and the guy I returned it through even said they'd sold dozens and this was the first bad one.He offered to trade it for a working unit, but I said no. I mean... if it does this right out of the box, imagine how much fun it will be trying to get my gun when the damned thing dies in an emergency. No thanks. The safe I keep my gun in must be AT LEAST as reliable as my gun is."
3,Pistol Box is a good buy for the money.,"The Pistol Box is a decent buy for the price. It does what is intended to do, which is secure you pistol.Word of advice don't try making a new code just use the one that is provided. When the batteries die you have to revert to the original code. In my case, my gun would dislodge the batteries and then I have to use the original code...luckly I didnt throw the manual away.All in all good buy for the money."
3,cheap clumsy adaquate safe,"small opening compared to gun vault type safe. large overhangs make it difficult to insert and remove larger items. No key means dead battery needs a 9 volt to reset and start over, so leaving this in a vehicle on hot days would mean no access due to dead battery. There is no security cable, so size wise it is portable but not able to secure it.On the other hand it is cheap and opens ok when set up. has holes in back to mount somewhere,so it could be a fairly fast opening box if the item is reasonably smaller than the inside dimensions"
3,It's OK,"My biggest complain is that my gun hardly fits in this safe. Yes no back lighted keys but I solved that with a automatic light that turn on as I open my drawer. Indeed as the previous posted mentions the electronics need to be carefully wrapped in electrical tape to prevent shorting.It's Ok for the money and if you have a small hand gun, no Dirty Harry Magnums allowed."
4,Very Good For The Price,"I actually have this pistol box's big brother- the medium pistol box. This box works great for a great price. Again, as others have stated, it won't keep a burglar from making off with this box, but it will keep children and guests from ""finding"" and handling your firearms. It is easy to operate and program. We practice with it every day and it opens quickly- within a couple seconds.After having this for about 2 months, the door began to stick closed. The keypad was working and I could hear the lock releasing the door, but the door would only open after several tries. The solution was to put a couple drops of oil at the point where the latch catches the door. Now it opens more smoothly than when it was new. When I buy another one of these (and I intend to do that), I will oil the latch as soon as I open the box."
2,Too small,"The safe works out of the box like it is supposed to. I guess that's the good part.The problem is that the 3 1/2 inch model is way too small to hold anything larger than a compact gun. My Glock 35, which is admittedly a large gun, could not even fit through the door, even after trying several different twists and turns. I suspect this small safe would be useless for most any 1911 style .45 caliber handgun as well.I was impressed with the lock mechanism, but it could definitely be 100% improved by a backup mechanical key lock and buttons that light up similar to a cell phone.If you are in the market, skip the small one and go for at least the medium."
4,Great handgun safe for those with children,"I really like this safe for keeping my children away from my firearm.Pros:1. It is not expensive.2. It is easy to use.3. Small enough to fit most anywhere (mine is screwed into the wall of my closet, and is hidden by my clothes).Cons:1. Keys don't light up at night.2. Keys are HOMAK, so having a meaningful code is not likely.3. If you have more than one handgun (with magazines), you may want a bigger size.Overall, I am well pleased with this safe."
4,Goofy shape,"Works as intended. One of the reviews complained about it being easy to break, etc. OK! I can kick your door down in probably 2-3 kicks! It will stop kids! In addition to the combination (which can be a combination of keys are once) you have to push the door down to release it within 5 seconds. When your kids get big enough to cram screwdrivers in and open it, you've got bigger problems on you hands! If you conceal it well, you've got a good chance that it will be secured. For the price, it's a winner! Oh! The shape is goofy, but the picture shows that."
4,Interesting overview but too broad a subject for MacDonald,"I love Mrs MacDonald's previous books and the way she usesfirst person accounts to put the reader onto the WorldWar I battlefield. For that reason, I snatched this bookthe second I saw it. However, I regret that I wasdisappointed in 1915. The reason is not Mrs MacDonald'swriting, which manages to keep the reader interested whilecovering an unbelievable amount of information. The problem is,a year is just too much subject to cover at the level ofdetail Mrs MacDonald uses, leaving me unsatisfied at the endof the book.I am looking forward more books from Mrs MacDonald."
4,Leslie Sansone Walking Tape,I bought this to replace the same video that had broken. Order was quickly received.
5,Excellente',Long awaited CD I purchased my copy at at Whispers concert and I am glad I did. You can not find this CD no where in my city. This is one of best for the Whispers in years. I just love this CD all the cuts on the album is excellent. Keep up the good work.
5,CAN'T KEEP THIS TO MYSELF!!,"Loved the cd. Been a Whispers fan since the seventies and I must say this one really touched my heart and made me feel like I was in love again. What a fantastik joy it was to listen and meditate on the words in all the songs on the ""For Your Ears Only"" cd. I listen to it over and over again. Much Continued blessings and success to the Whispers. I'll be waiting for the next cd to come. Keep blessing your fans with good soultry music.A big thanks from Lynn in OKC."
5,"This is definetly "" For Your Ears Only ""","I purchased this CD on March 1, 2006. When I opened up this CD and began to listen, I was floored, though I wasn't surprised . This is as good a CD as the Whispers have ever recorded-period. From start to finish, every song, on this CD, is sung with the passion and vocal mastery that only the Whispers can bring. If I could, I'd give it 'Ten stars' , instead of the five stars I'm allowed . If you're a 'true' Whispers fan, you'll love every song on this fantastic CD. This CD was well worth the nine years we've waited for a new recording from this mavelous singing group. For the young men of today, if you want to know how to 'Sing ' , this is the CD to listen to. Definetly worth five stars."
5,My favorite cd,I absolutely love this cd and I am a long time Whispers fan from way back when. They outdid theirselves and it should be number one. I love this cd so much I refused to make anyone copies telling them to buy their own so the Whispers can continue to make great music. Every song is good but my favorite is the title track and I can't play it enough. Definitely recommended.
3,Nothing's Striking,"This is an album I wanted to like more than I did: Intellectually, a Jane's Reunion is nothing but good, especially as Perry's had plenty of time to stretch his creative wings with Porno for Pyros and bring plenty of great new ideas back to the table.Unfortunately, what we get instead is mostly bereft of new ideas, sounding instead like a mediocre band doing a very great Jane's impression. This may sound harsher than it's meant: ""Strays"" is a decent album, one most bands would be quite proud of. But for a Jane's album ... there's no flashes of genius, of inspiration. The album rocks along quite nicely, but it never soars and never really grabs the listener.Mildly recommended for those looking for proof that rock isn't dead in the 21st century, although Jane's previous work still outshines this album by a large degree."
3,SOME GOOD SONGS...,"This JANES comeback got some good songs like JUST BECAUSE, TRUE NATURE and STRAYS...It's different from the old young angry JANE'S ADDICTION...The lyrics are very cool as always, but there's 4 or 5 songs that are not so great...Anyway, STRAYS is thousands times better than all the crap from the greedy music company from today...The truth is that NOTHING'S SHOKING and RITUAL DE LO HABITUAL are all time masterpieces, and probably everything they recorded now will always be in the shadow of classics like OCEAN SIZE, MOUNTAIN SONG, AIN'T NO RIGHT, HAD A DAD or THREE DAYS....LOVE YOU JANE!!!!"
1,Great Album but Copy Protected,"This album is copy protected so you won't be able to play it on your MP3 player, on your computer (without their software which didn't work for me), on some Car stereos and even on some home stereos!Tell them what you think about this sort of thing by taking your money elsewhere."
1,"Music is great, CD Control is garbage","This is one of the best albums I recommend you never buy.The music is bliss; powerful guitar and excellent singing. However, the copy control means that you likely won't be able to play the music as you'd like. I listen to music on my iPod when I travel or exercise, and I am unable to transfer the songs to my mp3 player. As such, it's a useless buy for me. Don't buy this album, as the only way to fight against companies like EMI is to hit them in their bank accounts."
4,As explosive as ever...,"After 13 long years, Jane's Addiction finally came back with their fourth studio album. The band certainly hasn't lost its touch after such a lengthy time! I definitely agree that the band put the alternative in ""alternative rock"". After all, they were a huge part of the alternative rock scene in the late 80's and early 90's. The psychedelic metal blues and Perry's soaring nasal vocals are especially appealing to a listener like myself. Those two aspects of JA's music are very prevalent on ""Strays"". Combine those two aspects with chugging guitars and a loud, dynamic sound and you have eleven great songs on the album! This is my very first JA's album, and I don't think it'll be the last!"
5,COMEBACK OF THE YEAR,"Janes Addiction is definitely back, and kicking once again with Strays. An explosive album, with magical work by the great Dave Navarro. Janes re-established themselves as one of the worlds great bands."
1,"Great music, if the CD will play","I'll be brief. The music on this CD is great. At least it was in the store and in my car, but the thing is copy protected and won't play on my (very high end) home CD player.I'll return it to the store and buy something else.Definitely not recommended."
5,great album by great band,"dont understand why people compare janes to nirvana here, janes is so much better, more better songs, good whole cd's not like nirvana, only few good songs the rest crap, and always whining about everything and then finally shoot him self. and perkins and navarro are much better musicians then cobain and grohl, nirvana was just a punk band. and why are people always so agianst it that band get together again and make music just for the fun of it? why can musicians come together and play music? they have been together live for many years and why not make an album? this album is realy good, better then most of the crap out today but not as good as their earlier albums but so what? just buy it!!!!!"
3,"Third verse, same as the first","Jane's Addiction changed my life with ""Nothing's Shocking."" As a musician and a music fan, I couldn't hear or play the same after I heard that album for the first time. ""Strays"" most certainly has not had the same effect. It's good, don't get me wrong, but there are too many cliches for it to stand out. I may have even given it a ""4,"" but ""Wrong Girl"" has to be one of the worst songs I've ever heard, and it's bland, boring blues rock has no place in the repetoire of what once was the most interesting, innovative hard rock band in the world."
4,Hit and Miss,"I'm a pretty hardcore jane's fan and I'm tired of old school jane's fans [ticked]off simply because this is new. Just because something is new doesn't make it whack. In fact there are a few songs on this album that could be on a ""Greatest Fix"" album of Jane's. ""Price I Pay"" has the signature Jane's funk-to-float flow (but what's up with the 80's hair band finish), it's impossible to not get that tweeky-sexed lift-off you used to get from ""3-Days"" and ""Ted Just Admit it"" from many of this album's moments. Avery's jungle bass is missed but Chaney is in his own tight way. Don't get me wrong, there are a few very weak songs but if you like any of Jane's old stuff, this album is worth it. I can't be sure but I think I even heard a Casey reference in it. Navarro shreds throughout-amazing stuff."
4,WOW,"I must admit I really wasn't expecting much. And there was a part of me that really didn't care that after a 13 year hiatus Jane's would put out a new disc...However; this is tight! There really isn't a bad song. I won't get into a full break down. Trust me when I say, ""Jane's fans this CD doesn't disappoint."" And for all you youngsters out there who want to trace your musical roots...Perry's one doped up/whacked out/eccentric guy and one of the few musical genius's of the late 80's early 90's; Nirvana may have killed Metal (and yes I consider Cobain in the same vain as Farrell) but Jane's pioneered the movement."
1,what the f***,"this sucks, i cannot believe that a band that gave us 'classic girl' and 'then she did' could slump to such a low. Porno for Pyros blows this out of the water."
2,Granny in Docs,"Once, Jane's Addiction was the most original, refreshing, inspiring and relevant band on the planet. This year's model is bland, embarrassing and bereft of ideas. Listening to Strays is like catching your grandmother wearing Doc Martens and sporting a blue mohawk: a fat old hasbeen trying to recapture some of the glory of youth. Farrell should have stuck with Porno For Pyros instead of hauling this old dinosaur out of the cupboard. Outside of True Nature, Price I Pay and perhaps Just Because, there is nothing on Strays that comes close to the passion, vitality and resolve of Good God's Urge, let alone the brilliance of Ritual or even Nothing's Shocking. This is without question the most disappointing album of the year."
4,80's icons return to school the nu-metal kids.,"It's a sign of just how stagnate the nu-metal scene has become when a group of veteran rockers like Janes Addiction can release a record that sounds like the old stuff and it seems fresh. ""Strays"" breaks little new ground for the band, but the time off between records for other projects has definitely renewed the groups energy and vigor. Great musicianship and sonic brilliance abound on this record as on all of Janes releases. Perry Ferrel's voice is still only so-so, but it is a distinctive instrument that compliments the bands sound very well. Make this a must for your collection if you love the 80's sound or if you've grown weary of nu-metal."
1,HORRIBLE!,It's just sad when how you love a band for years and in the millenium the suddenly suck! I'm sorry but this was just sad!
2,Back... and worse than ever!,"Fond are my memories of days gone by. I ""discovered"" Jane's Addiction before anyone else I knew, before Nothing's Shocking was even released. My buddies and I would listen to songs like ""My Time,"" or in their next album ""Summertime Rolls"" over some good conversation and drinks. We'd talk about the lyrics and try to duplicate the guitar riffs until we were too drunk or our fretboard fingers hurt too much to go on. Gone are those days. Jane's started their downward spiral when they released Ritual. They weren't completely done then, but there were inklings. Perry had gone off the deep end, and after several more years of too many drugs, so have the rest of them. In a word, this album sucks. It has no life to it. It's just flat, boring, and worthy of nothing other than the ""used"" bin at your local record store. Don't waste your time or money. They used to be cool. They just aren't anymore. Not even close. No way."
3,Expectations too high?,"After 13 years waiting for a new Janes studio album, it seems almost inevitable that it would not live up to expectations. While Strays is a good record compared to most of the garbage that is out there, it is not (and, without Eric Avery, really could not ever be) a peer to Nothing Shocking or Ritual. What this album lacks is the sense of nastiness and abandon that the earlier records had,the sense that Perry would just as same slit your throat as jump off stage and mount you; and the tension between those urges. Strays simply lacks that strong ambiguity and emotional undertone. Bottom line: while it is better than just about anything being done today, it is not as groundbreaking as its predecessors."
4,Aged with Taste,"13 years is a long time between studio albums. Most bands fade away, release the contractually embarassing greatest hits based on 2 albums or come back with even more embarassing attempts to rekindle their music in a day and age that laughs it off. Enter Jane's Addiction, with 3 of the 4 original members they have redefined the word ""comeback"". Strays sounds just as refreshing as the day they released Ritual de lo Habitual in 1990. Make no mistake, the boys have picked up where they left off. There are no leaps and bounds, no new sound, no experimental stuff...Nothing's Shocking! Strays actually seems to fit into the new millenium better than Ritual 13 years ago. However, that shouldn't be a surprise as Ritual was way ahead of it's time. Strays is a straight ahead rock album Jane's style that truly sounds like an extention of Ritual and can equally take it's place in Rock history today or back then."
4,some good stuff from an old band,"this record is worth the 10-13 year wait, it's everything you'd expect and some stuff you totally woudn't either4, but are happy it's there. i love it, i've been a huge fan from the beginning and this lives up to the legend."
3,What?,"I love Jane's Addiction. One of my earliest memories is listening to ""Nothing's Shocking"" in my big brother's car. They changed the way I listened to music. And now, more than ten years later,there first three albums are still among my favorites.They should have stayed retired. Don't get me wrong. This is still better than 90 percent of the stuff out there, but that isn't saying much. The edginess is gone and has been replaced with gloss. It pains me to give a three star review to Jane's Addiction. It pains me even more to say that it may deserve less."
5,Great Music,"There's a difference between great music and catchy songs, and that distinction is illustrated by this cd. If you're looking for music to hum along with, well maybe check out T.A.T.U. instead. But if you're looking for something a little deeper, here you are. Every single track on this cd is strong, and each gets more interesting with repeated listenings. And they all feature the incomparable Jane's wall of sound, with the fullness of Dave Navarro's guitar contrasting with Perry Farrell's wail. Put on the headphones, turn it way up and the rest of the world just seems to disappear..."
4,"Good songs, but missing that old fashioned rock power","Jane's Addiction is now three wily old veterans and a new guy, and ""Strays"" has eleven good songs on it. Perry Farrell's neo-hippie lyrics are a nice change from most of the nu-metal ""woe-is-me"" whining lyrics. He posits that everyone is rich if they can appreciate the little things in life, for example. The songs are well-crafted, but the production takes the power out of the songs. I don't know if there are too many background keyboards, or Dave Navarro's guitars are recorded wrong, but the songs just seem to lack power.That problem aside, there are 11 good stadium rocks songs on this good album."
4,Jane's Addiction is back!,"I'm so excited to listen to new material from Jane's Addiction! I saw them at Lollapalooza and they are certainly back, but for good? Anyways the cd is really amazing they have matured so much and you can tell by listening to the new single ""Just because"". They also go back to some old school funk with ""Wrong girl"" which is the best on the cd. The self titled track ""strays"" is excellent too. Go give them a shot, you'll be glad you did."
1,I wish there were a zero star rating for this stinker,"This is a great band, but personally i dont like this album one bit. its straight forward and simple, pretty much just a mediocre rock album of the late nineties in my opinion. but if your into that, buy it."
1,UGH!,Jane's Addiction defined alternative in both lifestyle and music. It's a shame that they wrote a CD of songs that sound like Jane's songs and not a CD of Jane's songs.Where the hell did Eric Avery go?
3,More Pyros than Jane's!!!!,"A good album by far, BUT being a huge Jane's fan, I was very disappointed overall! The raw edge of Jane's is replaced with the more mellow sounds of Pyro. That's not a bad thing but not a good one when I've waited almost ten years for new stuff. Some real nice tunes but overall, it's the weakest Jane's album in their small collection. DVD is pretty cool with 5 tunes played live from various gigs (mostly from clubs in LA). Is it worth buying??? Compared to most of the pathetic stuff being called rock nowadays, this album shows what real rock is about (so yes it's worth getting). Again though, I must warn true Jane's fans that they will be let down if they are expecting a real hard rocking album!!!"
2,Token Comeback Album,"It's not awful. There are some very listenable tunes here (See ""The Riches"", ""Wrong Girl"", ""Suffer Some""). ""Superhero"" was a decent song until it became the theme for HBO's ""Entourage"", now it's everywhere you see any mention of the show.The main problem here is that this just isn't Jane's Addiction the way people know them (""Three Days"", ""Summertime Rolls"", etc..). It's like trading in your Coke for Jewel Cola. Ain't got no right, right Jane's?? This is what you get when a band goes away in their prime, then comes back for the pity encore.It's like watching Deion Sanders coming out of retirement, he's alright, but he ain't no Neon Deion. I suppose you can't really expect a bunch of aging icons to pack the same punch they did. It's just kinda sad to see them try."
3,I can understand why people don't like it.,"I don't care for this album. I bought this with Ritual DE Lo Habitual. So I still like Jane's Addiction. I haven't given much of a listen after 1 year. It sounds differant from Ritual, it sounds like newer metal that doesn't suck. I would serioulsy prefer if you are allready a Jane's Addiction fan."
3,The front cover says it all...,"Jane's Addiction. How do you summarize the works of a band that effectively changed the face of alternative music in the 90's? These guys were there at the beginning, along with ""The Pixies"", and in their time, they were epic. Their records will forever be a part of my life, and the values they instilled in me will not soon be forgotten.That being said, this album is a wash of overproduced and commercialized numbers that the band recorded, as far as I can tell, to nuture a mid-life crisis. Everything the band stood for in the past seems to have been in vain as they fail to heed their own words on this mainstream, done-a-hundred-times rock album. You can still feel the prescence of ""Jane's Addiction"" underneath the wreck, but it's not enough. As with ""Gravity"" by ""Our Lady Peace"", these are songs that A LOT of people are going to be able to enjoy, and get into, but it's not for previous fans of the band."
2,Genius turns generic,"If you listened to rock radio in the year this album came out, you'd be impressed with Jane's Addiction. They're better than just about every band out there. But if you compare this album to Nothing's Shocking and Ritual de lo Habitual, Strays sounds horrible.Was Eric Avery really THAT important? Maybe. Look at the songwriting credits --- unlike the old albums, these songs weren't written exclusively by the four original band members. The producer and members of Porno for Pyros are credited as co-writers on most of the songs. Maybe that's the problem. The music is watered down and over-produced. A few songs are good (Just Because and Everybody's Friend) but the majority are extremely bad (like Superhero and Hypersonic).At this point, Jane's Addiction is a brand, not a band. They cashed in and stopped taking chances. If you want generic hard rock played well and perfectly produced, buy this (and the self-titled Audioslave album too)."
3,Weak songwriting,"Although sonically slick, Strays does not stand up to classic Jane's material. Nice try but it all sound the same; a bit hurried & shallow. It doesn't have the depth of Nothings Shocking nor does it breath like Ritual de Lo Habitual.Great bands more than anything else are about chemistry - which comes thru in the songwriting and vibe. Eric Avery lent the perfect balance of depth and breath to this band that formerly produced greatness. He is missed."
2,Review of a useless album,"Jane's Addiction was a great band of the early '90's. They had their hits and their odd little gems and they DEFINED alternative. Everything about them from their music to their dress to their lyrics screamed out loud, ""the freaks are taking over, join us!""...Then they went away and a lot of people forgot what they were all about. That is what Jane's Addiction was banking on when they made this album, that nobody would care if they had nothing to say, that the name of the band alone would conjure up some jagged memories of a society desperately stuck between the Reagan era and our cellphone culture. Money must have run out for these guys, 'cause they sure didn't have any other reason to come back...at least the music sounds that way."
5,Simply Jane,Another amazing masterpeice! i hope only this will continue. Jane's Addiction is one of the best bands of all time. This cd is so amazing i don't know how to put it into words. GO BUY IT!
3,"Really good, but not classic Jane's music","Many songs are solid, but the emotional depth of their older songs is missing. As such, it's just good music, not an experiecne of listening to something inspirational. If this is just a warm up for their next album, great -- I'm looking forward to it."
3,Trip Away....again,"""There you are!"" quips Perry Farrell at the end of one of my favorite songs off of the new album from Jane's Addiction. (Minus original bassist Eric Avery). And there they are. I give this album 3 and a half stars. Solid as ever. The album is good overall. Navarro, in particular seems very focused in his guitar and songwriting work. Some of the songs don't have the impact or drama of something from ""Ritual de la Habitual"" but they do rock. And in today's pathetic music scene, that is a very GOOD thing.These guys have never been afraid to do ""their own thing"" and this is still very relevant in the song ""Price I pay"". This album, although not in the league of ""ritual"" has what I think is the best example of the Jane's sound in ""Just Because"". What a great summer song!Welcome back guys."
2,Should have stayed disbanded,"Wish they left well enough alone....This album tarnishes the great music they made over a decade ago. Not the worse thing out there, but not great either."
2,Jane went to rehab,Jane's limp return with 03's Strays gives off one of those horrid vibes akin to the musical equivalent of seeing your vibrant pet pooch neutered and on the couch by nine.
2,... ... ...,"i cant describe how i felt after i listened 2 this cd...how i wasted 14 bucks...awful...i still feel awful! now i havent heard any other janes addiction material, but just because caught my attention and its an awesome song, the only awesome song outta the 11 tracks. all the songs sound the same i swear i cant tell one song from another!!! if your a fan of this group buy the cd...if you like 'just because' and havent really heard anything from this group b4 hand...dont buy it!!"
2,huge disappointment !!,"When you have a legacy like Janes Addiction, putting out an album after 13 years is no easy task. Maybe Janes just shouldnt have bothered. The main ingredients in this lackluster album are warmed over riffs, mundane lyrics and an absense of the charm that made Janes Addiction a classic band. Only the excellent single, Just Because rises to the stature that the bands previous material set. The first few songs are alright, but is this really the band that changed popular music less than 20 years ago? Strays makes it apparent just how important departed bassist Eric Avery was to the songwriting of this band. Who knows, maybe this is a sound that will bring Janes more commercial success than their previous records, but as a longtime fan, I found this to be a huge letdown."
4,Jane Strays,"I don't see what the fuss is all about. After reading the negative reviews you'ld have thought this CD was a total sell out. It irritates me when ""purists"" snub new work for the sake of snubbing it. Please. This album is good, it flows well, the songs are well written and constructed but more importantly it creates a cool vibe. That vibe is what I listen to music for. Clearly this has some production flaws but overall I really like it."
3,OKAY,"Not as Good as old Janes, but will take it alive and wiggling.Strays is the only good tune on here."
3,Pull up bar for door frame,Make sure you tighten it well. I fell and it cracked me in the throat. The foam also has worn a bit over a year or so but otherwise a good product.
4,Exactly what I expected.,"This pull up bar is exactly what I expected when I was looking for a telescopic bar. My only problem is that the doorframe to my room is too weak, so it cracked a little. Other than that, the bar works exactly like it was supposed to."
3,"OK, but disappointed","The bar was sturdy and the expansion mechanism easy to use & reliable. However, the door mounting plates required modification. I expected a cradle type door mount, but the plates were designed for permanent installation."
2,Not Impressed with this pull up bar,"I needed this bar to fit in my hallway which measures 37.5 inches. Since this product description mentions that it fits 24-39 inches i thought i found what i needed. However once i received it and try to spread it to its max width i realized that the top width it can fit is roughly 36 inches and even then it would be a little wobbly. Other then that the bar is nothing special, the hand grips limit where you can grip the bar and unless you have steel door frames, jaming it using pressure separated and cracked my door frame. Also it came with no installation instructions whats so ever."
3,Great moisturizer. Great smell. Little effect.,"I'm 39, and am starting to get some small wrinkles around my eyes. Figured a little Billy Jealousy couldn't hurt, plus all the obviously not planted at all reviews for this product say such great things about it. Well, this does nothing for to diminish wrinkles after nearly a month of use. So, since that's it's primary purpose, I deduct two stars.On the other hand, it does smell great, and does moisturize pretty well (pretty much all day!). I used this in conjunction with Billy Jealousy Wipeout eye cream (which doesn't do what it states either), and my face is totally un-dry for the whole day. Now, if you think a decent scent and that type of moisturizer is worth the inflated price of what say, Nivea can do for about half the cost (minus the nice scent), then I suppose this is for you. :) Otherwise, save some bucks and just go for someEucerin Lotion, Intensive Repair, 16.9-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 2). That stuff is awesome on my face, too."
2,Half-head of hair,"This doll looks ""life-like"" and nice from the front. The doll does not have a full head of hair - long hair in the front, and extremely short hair in the back (this is definitely my biggest complaint). Hair ties broke and bracelet broke - first day out of box. Body is nice weight/quality. Real looking doll, nice clothes. However, I expected a $70 doll to have a full head of hair."
1,Save your money,"Don't buy this blender. I bought it to make smoothies in the morning. We used it twice and the blender began to smoke and finally just shut down. I expected that Black and Decker would make a more quality product, but apparently not."
3,Good,"The other reviewers here have given you the scorecard on the Superfine Dandelion.'This is great jangle pop that has echos of the Byrds, but with a more stripped garage sound. While keeping a clean guitar base, superfine have a good feel for dynamics: they are amply able to handle both up and mid-tempo tracks, and add light Indian, country and folk shades.For me this music is just a little stripped. I wonder how this band would sound with a few strings and horns added. But, hey, that is my little taste issue. If you like intelligent pop with a little jangle, you will love this."
3,An interesting experiment about writers in actual society,"Provocative. Daring. A voice that electrifies. Yet, the book has to be seen in a wider lens. It is and isn't about Central America. It, might be, about writers in actual times, in a globalize world. The way to go farther than a sylable. It is also a begginer's work. It is an experimental text. The main idea is far stronger than the ending. The reading is recommended. Rey Rosa is at the moment the best Guatemala has to offer."
1,Twice as big as described,"I wanted a small two cup teapot and this product was described as such. The box it was packed in identifes it as a two cup pot. However it is not; it is a large four cup pot! So it is a disappointment and not as ""advertised""."
4,Perfect,"This is the perfect little size for a one-two cup of tea serving. I put water in and put the whole thing in the microwave, then put my teabag & sugar in and when ready, pour into a serving mug. Love it!"
4,"nice looking watch, digital window too small","I've been through generations of digital watches with plastic bands. My wife thinks they look nerdy but I like the alarm and other gadgets. I'm tired of wearing these things out though and wanted something that looked nicer. This is a very nice looking, sturdy watch which was what I wanted. It also has the window with the digital time, date, alarm, etc. My only complaint is that that window is tiny and not easy to see. Also the light for night viewing is wimpy. The watch works fine and is very nice looking but I wish the window were a bit larger.One year later the digital window keeps setting it self back to Jan 1 and 12:00 noon. Poor quality. Look elsewhere"
2,Defective Watch,I had the watch 2 weeks and it reset itself to 1/1/01 three times. No idea why it did this. Sent it back.
3,It fades.,"This is a very attractive car magnet, but the red fades away in just a few months. Something needs to be done to embed the red into the flexible material so this magnet stands up to being displayed on an automobile."
2,"Inexpenisve~maybe, but extremely difficult to execute","I was so excited to get this book and then it was like.....uuggghh. This is chef quality cooking people! These are recipes that normal people dont eat! I consider myself and my husband to be somewhat knowledgable in the culinary arts and yet, this stuff was way too complicated for us. If you are an experienced chef, its probably a great book."
2,Good book but problem with printing,"I really like this cookbook and had taken it out at the library so many times I decided to finally buy it. I like that the recipes are sort of pseudo-gourmet so you get some really tasty and impressive-looking meals without totally breaking the budget. However, the book I received had had a problem with printing and contained only even-numbered pages - so half of the pages were missing! I got a replacement book, but it had the same problem. Otherwise I would have highly recommended this book."
5,Cat loves!,"My cats loves these and have become her new favorite treat, I have to start ordering cases of these now!!!"
3,depends on your cat,"I bought these for my mom's cats. Most of them just ignored the fresheners, but one cat was crazy for them! He'd rub his head all over the tin and try to bite it open. I really know if it freshened his breath, though."
4,Dynamite Masters!,"I saw this band perform live in Memphis last night & I bought the album because it was released on my birthday (so I actually had spending money) and because their sound was...interesting to say the least. My ears are still ringing, but it's a happy ringing--these guys know what they're doing and I had a great time. The music is very 60's-ish psychedelic with wailing/screeching guitars all around. Ryuichi (bassist) is amazing, I had an extra fun time with him since he put his bass around my neck and let me play it for awhile ^_~ Shinji (guitar, vocals) looked so tired by the end, but he was very gracious and put on an awesome show for us. This music is good--if you like the loud trippin' kind of rock music, then this is for you! Buy it!"
4,Good on atmosphere,"The problem I have with Joanne Harris' work is that I seem to have read what I consider her best book first (Five quarters of the Orange), therefore I am always expecting her other books to be as good as that one, and so far, none of them are ! This book conveys a wonderful atmosphere of a windswept Atlantic shoreline which I find very nostalgic and a selection of interesting characters, and as always in her stories, a little bit of 'magic'. Generally, a good read."
2,So sad...,"...this is the only Joanne Harris novel that caused me to lose interest mid-way through. Perhaps it just wasn't time for me to read it? I adore all of her other work, so it surprised me not to fall in love with this one as well."
1,Coastliners by Joanne Harris,"I've read several other books by this author and had to check several times to be sure it was actually written by Joanne Harris. Nothing in the style was similar.The dialog, action and theme appeared to be written for a pre-teen girl. I think my granddaughter would have enjoyed this much more than me."
2,Ugh...,"OK, part of my dissapointment with this might have been with the narrator. I found her overly French pronunciation of names incredibly jarring against the American English reading.But setting that aside, the characters in this book are hard to like. Infact, I found myself wondering repeatedly why Madeline would even bother to care about any of them, since they did not. And in the end, neither do I. I kind of hoped the sea would swallow them all up and but them--and me--out of our misery."
2,Waste of time,"I must say after having read ""Chocolat"" this was a huge disappointment! Even though, in my view quite a few of the characters are distinct and developed, this book comes out to nothing. Mostly becasue it's simply tremendously boring.The sleepy community on a French seaside doesn't exactly get exciting by reading about a bunch of grouchy people who sit around and do nothing but complain all day long.It completely lacks the wonderful atmosphere of ""Chocolat"", and that fantastic magic is just not there. I got a bit suprised by some of the happenings at the end, which is why I give it 2 stars and not 1."
4,Very different to her other novels,"Despite being very different in feel to most of her other work, this book is well worth a read. I began reading it with no real expectations given the mixed reviews it has received here. However I really enjoyed this book. Unlike Blackberry Wine, the characters in this novel were well formed and likeable. It doesn't have the magic of food in this novel, only the magic of the sea."
2,Yawn...,"Sorry, but even on tape I could not get to the end of this. It could use a bit of editing and the accent of the speaker is a bit annoying. Oh well, perhaps a good read?"
2,Coastliners: A Novel,"A surprisingly ""cheesy"" novel. Unbelievable characters put forward as if they were scenery. Locations carefully described, almost as if the work was a travelogue. Grade ""B"" future movie with little to know human empathy displayed."
3,It had interesting setting details,The storyline was not that interesting. It lagged and then finally ended. Just not enough character development. Not one I would recommend.
3,Slow-moving island tale,"Joanne Harris tells the story of Mado, a young woman who returns to the island off the coast of France where she was born. She and her mother had left the island 10 years previously and her mother was now dead. When she meets her father again, she can see that he has deteriorated physically and emotionally and he is just as uncommunicative as she remembers him to be. People on the island seem frozen in time. The same customs, feuds, and supersitions are all in place, as Mado remembers them. The book is very difficult to get into and moves at a maddeningly slow pace, much like life on the island. Things do pick up a bit towards the middle of the book, and at the end numerous secrets are revealed. Several of the characters in the book are not who they seem to be, and the secrets in their lives have caused them to live in self-destructive ways. I loved the movie, ""Chocolat"" and had high hopes for this book, but I was disappointed in it."
1,Immature protagonist,"Mother always did like you better; for that matter, so did Dad. This is the theme upon which Harris's new novel is based. The critics are saying it's about returning but it's really about self-pity as well as self-aggrandizement. Every time a problem arises, Mado races to the rescue (probably in an effort to prove to Dad that he should have loved her best)And if that's the point, then Harris failed to show me that the issue was with Mado and not with Harris herself. This felt like a first book. You know the ones--thinly veiled autobiography where the author airs a tired old grievance. And because of her past success, her editor and the critics let her get away with it. She also got away with my money and now I have a grievance to air."
2,Standard Saddle Armrest Bag,"Bag is smaller than it looks,slides on the armrest and the velcro closer is not that easy to open unless you are left handed and used to struggleing with velcro."
2,Not so nice,"Overall, it's a nice product but it has some issues!! I ordered 3 quilts from this manufacturer and they all had problems. This one had yellowing all over the quilt at the seams and at the back. Also, much of the stitching was loose or already coming out. The colors are navy and black floral (didn't expect the black floral). The background is Ecru. If you get a good one then it's a great deal. Otherwise, keep looking. NOT a very high quality product."
1,Failed when I need it most,"I've been using RE 5.0 for about 18 months. It isn't intuitive, and every time I made a backup I had to re-learn the non-standard interface, but I was able to make backups.My hard drive volumes were trashed beyond repair while installing another product, so I inserted the RE CD to restore my disk. Unfortunately, everytime the boot-up gets about 90% done, I get a System error message and the whole thing locks up.Now I have a crashed computer, a complete backup of my files on an external Firewire, and a completely useless CD with Retrospect Express printed on it.Incidentally, the 2 other applications that I bought to help me during these events also didn't work. It's quite a beautiful thing."
1,Has not improved,"Five(?) years ago I owned a very early version of this product which I used on a Mac PowerBook. Then I found it difficult to set up and use with almost incomprehensible instructions. I recently bought a new PowerBook and my current easy to use back up program (Copy Agent will not work OS X. (Although I am considering dumping OS X too - but that's another story) I thought I would try Retrospect Express to back up to Zip 250 discs. Well, the program has not improved and has proven as inscrutable to use as the first time. I spent five hours over several days trying to set it up. The user interface is not intuitive and the language used in the instructions is almost incomprehensible. And the language usage is beyond belief ... ""Forget"" instead of ""Delete?"" Give me a break. My hat is off to those who have mastered this backward looking program."
4,"Don't give up, it's so much fun.","I found a few of the moves in this video to be difficult to pick up at first, but I refused to give up because the rest was so much fun. The first time I did the video, I was screwing up some of the moves left and right (some of the moves are easy, some take more coordination), but I was still getting a good workout and kept noticing that I had a smile on my face. It didn't feel like work, it was fun. Stick with it and you will probably end up loving it."
3,"not bad, not great","I got this because I love bollywood and the music. This workout, however, is so-so. It's a lot of repetition and once you finally get it...the moves don't match the music. That was particularly frustrating because I want to DANCE (and the workout is an aside). Also, I sometimes wished that the camara moved back so that you could see the whole move. That being said, you definitely sweat and get a workout. There is a lot of jumping and you certainly feel that you did some great aerobic activity. I wish her warm up and cool down were expanded...it's a lot of up and down shoulders and Jain saying ""awesome."" Overall, I will continue to do this workout but I'm still looking for a great bollywood workout."
1,"waste of money, poor editing and cinematography","If you own any of Sarina's other Bhangra videos, don't bother with this. It's just the same steps all over again. Very repetitive. All she did differentlyt was put different music in it (which isn't even Bollywood music) and have her dancers change clothes. The cinematography and camera angles were just terrible. You can't even see her feet during most of the dance segments, yet you can tell from glimpses of the background dancers there's some fancy footwork going on. You just see her flailing her arms and wearing that annoying headset the whole time, which I found to be a turn off.I think if you really want to learn bollywood dance, watch a few bollywood videos on YouTube for free, copy the moves, and viola, you can learn the dance."
4,Very Good,"Pros: Good workout, burns calories along with fun music andbollywood steps, which you can dance away at the parties.Cons: Complete Steps are taught first and then reviewed and then you go atfull speed.I like the Masala Bhangra Workout Vol 1, where 4 steps are taught, reviewed and practiced and then you go to the next steps."
1,Voice doesn't match up with her lips and workout!,"Her voice doesn't match up with her lips and dance moves. Shame, I love this workout but no seller contact info on this! Only option is to return it."
4,High Impact workout,I did like this but I agree with other viewres about the camera work. I did not rent a dance video to see the instructors face.this is a high impact cardio workout. I found the steps simple and very bouncy. I like this enough to check out her other videos. If you are looking for a little more complex moves try Bollyrobics.
2,Roland Boss BR-600 DVD Tutorial,Somewhat helpful but not for beginners. The DVD tutorial assumes you know quite a bit about sound mixing and recording.
1,A CD WRITTEN AND PRODUCED FOR TECHIES,"I PURCHASED THE BOSS BR-600 DIGITAL RECORDER AND FOUND THE INSTRUCTION MANUAL VERY CONFUSING. JUST TO GET STARTED, THE MANUAL JUMPED AROUND, AT TIMES, 30 PAGES OR MORE INSTEAD OF PAGE BY PAGE INSTRUCTIONS, I THEN PURCHASED THE INSTRUCTIONAL CD AND FOUND THE INSTRUCTOR/ NARRATOR DOING THE SAME. FRUSTRATED, I CONTACTED A TECH AT THE MANUFACTURERS HELP LINE, THE TECH WAS VERY HELPFUL, HE WALKED ME THROUGH THE INFORMATION THAT WAS NEEDED (STEP BY STEP). THE EQUIPMENT IS GREAT, THE CD AND INSTRUCTION MANUAL NEED TO BE REWRITTEN IN A CONTINUOUS STEP BY STEP MANNER FOR THE NEXT GENERATION EQUIPMENT.THE CD WAS A WASTE OF MY MONEY, BOSS MUST REMEMBER, THIS EQUIPMENT IS USED BY MUSICIANS NOT COMPUTER PROFESSIONALS. MY RECOMMENDATION IS TO CALL THE HELP LINE AND SAVE YOUR MONEY.John Grim"
3,disappointed,"I guess you could say that i'm a fan of the midnight evils. I own 'straight til morning', and i like it very much. so, when i saw that they were releasing a new album, i was excited. however, when i got it, and listened to it, i discovered that (unless i am mistaken, and his voice changed dramatically) they got rid of jonny, their singer from the last album. now, i'm not saying that he was excellent, but their new vocalist(s) make him seem that way. My favorite song from this album, ""walkin out the door"", is decent, but too short and simplistic; at the end it leaves you waiting for more. ""party party party"" is decent, but is way too short.so, in short, the album is a disappointment, and i'd recomend that you buy 'straight til morning' instead. if you already have that, then check out some other band."
1,Not worth the money,The audio quality on these head phones is terrible. My ear plugs are MUCH better. Don't waste your money on them.
2,OK,"Inexpensive, but you get what you pay for. We used them in a heavily-used computer lab for K-6 grade. They would last 2-4 months at best even when we had hooks on the computer for students to hang them on. Foam pads fell off.within the first few weeks."
3,Good Sound but Very Uncomfortable,"The sound is well for how inexpensive they are, but the wear of these things are awkward and can be painful after long use. They are all around small in size due to them being the cheapest manufacture of cost, budgeting more for the sound quality, rather than the wear. But they work and provide good audio."
4,"Cheap, Medium-Grade Basic Headphones","Pros: cheap, not flimsy, cheap, decent sound (though not great), cheap.Cons: not big on comfort (not painful really, but not gentle on the ears); sound is a bit muddy, you'll need to tweak eq settings to get a fuller sound.Overall: exactly what I needed for the right price."
1,very bad quality,This is a second set of Koss UR-10 Closed-ear Design Stereo Headphones and neither set lasted more than 3 months. The wire connecting to the plug got damaged for no reason. After it happened the fiirst time I thought that it was some aberation since Koss was a reputable manufacturer. Therefore I purchased Koss headphones i again. Quite a mistake. The manufacturing quality is very bad and headphones stop stopped working after 3 months.[ASIN:B0001IM95U Koss UR-10 Closed-ear Design Stereo Headphones]]
3,Good headphones - with a few faults,"I have mixed feelings about these headphones. Their sound quality is great considering the price, but they can get a tad uncomfortable after wearing them for a couple of hours, since they are on-ear. My biggest problem however, was that the connection between the headphone jack and the wire got frayed within 2 months of everyday use, and considering the headphones were only used indoors, on a laptop, that is quite unacceptable."
2,"Sleek Look, Great Sound","It was a very nice product at the moment... but they broke only after a couple months. I was hoping to get a bit more out of them.(PROS)~Nice sound quality~Nice, sleek look~Feels sturdy, and not cheap like other headphones(CONS)-Cord was cheap, and flimsy-Didn't last long with medium usage"
3,"decent, but uncomfortable","very small for the ear, buy only if you want something inexpensive for home use."
3,Disappointed,The sound of the headphones were great but they are very uncomfortable when I put them on my ears. They are not adjustable.
1,Worked for about 10 seconds then headphone shorted out,"Within 10 secs of first use, the headset developed a short near the molded plug - headphone stopped working. Unfortunately, I attempted a repair to replace the 6-pin DIN plug, so can't return it now. :( Note that the wiring on this headset is a crazy small gauge and unshielded. I'm not surprised it shorted out, as the individual wires run so close to each other."
3,Love Leslie not the DVD,"This was a good 3 mile exercise from Leslie, however as per other reviews there are skips all throughout the video. I order another one hoping that the second one would not have the skips, but unfortunately it had the same annoying skips. As I read other reviews I guess this is the fault of the company that reproduced these from VHS. Anyway, the skips don't make it impossible to work out to it but, they are annoying. Hopefully they will fix this in the future and I can get one without the flaw."
2,DVD Quality is Terrible - Buy Another Sansone Workout,"The workout itself was okay (though a bit dated). It was typical Leslie. Pretty perky, but the moves are down to earth enough that she makes it enjoyable. I really loved the Power Firm section as I hadn't seen anything similar on her tapes.However the dvd transfer was of such poor quality that it skips through the workout. The pauses threw off me off repeatedly. You can't keep any rhythm to your workout given the dvd flaws.Try Sansone's Walk Away the Pounds or Express dvds. Just leave this one alone as it isn't work the plastic it was transferred on to."
1,LOTS OF GLITCHES!,THIS DVD (BY UNICORN STUDIO/LEISURE ENTERTAINMENT) HAS A LOT OF GLITCHES WITHIN THE ENTIRE WORKOUT AND IT IS RATHER ANNOYING. I HOPE GOODTIMES STUDIO RELEASES THIS DVD IN THE FUTURE.
4,Great Workout!,"This 3-mile in-home walking workout is fabulous. In addition to the three miles of walking/kicking/side-stepping/etc., she incorporates upper body work using one- or two-pound weights. I love every minute and every mile of the workout and look forward to doing it every morning. The reason I rated the DVD as 4 stars instead of 5, is that it has technical flaws. Every 5 minutes, literally, it jumps. I have read other reviews of the DVD and they mentioned the same thing. My daughter and my sisters all have the same workout DVD and all are flawed in exactly the same way. It's a mystery why Leslie Sansone would release it that way, but flaws and all, it's a wonderful workout."
4,Great walk workout,"I love this DVD! I've started doing it everyday and the workout is so good! Since I've pretty much memorized all the moves, I put the DVD in my laptop and do it while I watch TV in the living room. It goes by so fast and I can't believe I've actually walked three miles!"
1,Not a good choice,"This DVD is one of Leslie Sansone's earlier efforts and isn't worth the money unless you simply want to add to an existing collection of her workouts for a slight change in routine. Because it is an older release, it is of very poor quality - the picture is grainy, the sound is poor, and (with my copy at least) the DVD skips a bit. The routine is sprightly, though, and has a few moves she doesn't often use anymore in her later DVD's. This routine also has a good upper body workout as part of the walk. All in all, if you can only pick up one or two of her workouts, you should try for some of the later 3-mile releases. Get this only as an add-on, if that."

1,OMGawd very unsafe!!!,Opened the item and one cuff needed force to close. When the cuff was closed we couldn't use the safety latch or key to open. The safety latch was forced open with my son's finger and the latch ended up cutting deep into his finger. The package was damaged and didn't look anything like the item in the picture!!!
5,A wonderful Journey,"A must read for anyone searching for the truth. This book allows you to delve into the depths of your own personal ""knowing"" things. Freeing of the mind, and all of it's negetive programming is a must for this read...many doors will open once that has been accomplished and the truth will be known within the reader's heart. I highly recommend this for anyone who is trying to find the God inside."
2,"The Universe ""disected""","I have read every book Sylvia Browne has written. In every case I was not able to put it down. This one, however, took me a very long time to get through. Francine (Sylvia's spirit guide) pretty much took over this book. Francine is very to the point, technical, and definitely lacking in humor (unlike Sylvia). I suppose that is why I found it completely boring. If you are looking for answers to the how's and why's of the universe, read this book. Believe me, it will give you a disection. If you are expecting a flowing, easy to read, comforting, and entertaining, typical Sylvia Browne book, forget it."
5,Great,"I found Sylvia Browne's God, Creation, and Tools for Life concise and practical. It is one of the few books I've read that begins to answer the age-old question, ""What is the meaning of life?""The book sheds light on how God's universe works and on humanity's purpose in that universe. I finished the book with a deeper sense of who I am, my purpose in life, and what I need to do to fulfill that purpose. I highly recommend this book to any open-minded person on a spiritual quest."
3,NOTICE; To Sylvia Browne Fans,"I write from IRELANDI really think sylvia is great. But, But I am really find it hard to believe in ''Raheim'' her other spirit guide. She never wrote about him in the ''Adventures of a Psychic''....Why Not? This is what I find hard to believe she had another spirit guide and she never told us about him....? But I think this book was a excellent read and I do believe in Sylvia Browne bigtime she is a true psychic. I have seen her on the Sally Jessy Show and she is amazing.....NOTICE DO YOU ALL WANNA HEAR A JOKE...... Sylvia was sitting answering questions on the Montal Williams Show. She was rubbering her nail up and down her face and suddenly her nail sticks in her eye. She stands up screaming and pulls the nail from her eye and her eye pops out.....'and have a guess what Montal says'''Sylvia you didn't see that one did you...ha ha ha ha....SYLVIA keep on written more books you are the best.

1,Just Google Sylvia Browne CNN and You Will Find That She is a Fake,"Do not believe what the book tells you about only the ""White"" entities being saved. Or anything in this book for that matter. Just do a Google on Sylvia Browne CNN and you will find that she is in fact a fake, a sham and a con artist. She takes advantage of those who are vulnerable. Beware of this book or any of her books for that matter."
2,Advice from a fan,"I love Sylvia for her guidance and her humor. I read ""The Other Side and Back,"" and thought it was excellent and right on target. However, ""God, Creation and Tools for Life"" disappointed me. I cannot recommend the book overall, although it has several positive and helpful messages. The discussions of light and dark entities and the way suicides are treated in particular do not ring true to me. These ideas do not resonate with the message of Love and Hope that are embraced in the book. Every one finds the light eventually. All I can say is beware of letting others do your spiritual work for you. Your own intuition will tell you what is true."
4,Whatever happened to this brother....,"I saw this smooth brother in, of all places, Wisconsin Dells in about 1990...he was playing in a teen dance club called DJ's. I am not sure how they ever got him to drive the 3 hours from Ill but that place, at that time, was one hip place to be seen. In the middle of freaken nowhere. I grew up near Madison and we went roadtripped up there every weekend for nearly 2 years.My cousin from Chicago left a mix he recorded off the radio at my house and i played for my boys at a party and we first heard get funky, the mass dubbing began. Sadly this cousin, John Neal, was killed on his 1992 Katana when a fool pulled out in front of him. Saddest day of my life.Anyway, F.Eddie is a safe buy for all of us that were part of the house movement."
5,Great book,This is a book that tells a horrible tale. I could relate to the book and felt very strongly about the topic at hand. Alice Sebold is a great writer and this book reflects that.
3,not what I expected ...,"As a rape victim myself I was really hoping for the book to be more, well, hopeful. It was well written, but it tendes to drag at certain points and it was almost add though she didn't over come it at all. It was sad."
2,Waste of time,"Since I really liked ""Lovely Bones"", I was so excited to read another work by Alice, especially since it got such great reviews. How disappointing. There was little if any cohesiveness. The trial was the best part of the book, and after that--nothing."
2,Throughly dissapointed in this book,I thought Alice Sebold would have a winner here and nope I was throughly dissapointed here and thought how awful and she came out with such a wonderful book before and I loved that one but sadly this one was a dissapointment .
2,A bit sophomoric and too angry for my taste...,"I found Alice's story interesting but her presentation sorely lacking. There was almost a misanthropic feel to the entire text, as though she always hated people, men especially, and being brutally raped was the perfect excuse to case her hatred of the human race in a book and sell it. I felt sorry for what she endured, and I applaud her courage and bravery in recovering from that traumatic event. I didn't care to hear about her entire childhood and bizarre relationship with her parents. I just felt that she wandered endlessly, and didn't stay focused on the story that was truly hers. Sadly, this is not one of the better memoirs about rape/sexual assault. There just isn't enough substantial material in the author's life to fill 250 odd pages."
2,Unbearably Unlucky,"All I could say when I was reading this book was: ""God help me,"" It was horrible. I had just come off of the cusp of The Lovely Bones (Which was breathtaking beautiful) and I greatly looked forward to reading her first novel. I was quickly sorry for that longing. How could an author stray so differently. This was just a yawn through of her rape to which to projected unrealist characters (her family and friends) while she gave off the aoura that nothing was wronge and then all of the sudden she would burst into tears and we- the reader- would have no idea why. The chapter with just the rape in it was captivating, but that's pretty much it, and toward the end theirs a courtroom chapter that drags on forever and is completly dry when it comes to feelings and emotions. I can only hope that when Alice Sebold's next book comes out that it swims into the same vain as The Lovely Bones and not this strange and dry work that was its predecessor."
2,Not her best effort!,I did not walk away from this book feeling moved and blown away like I did the Lovely Bones. I know this is her personal story but I don't think she captured the emotions that she did in the Lovely Bones.
5,Beautiful story about a young girl's struggle to triumph,"I had a hard time getting into the Lovely Bones, but Lucky was quite the opposite. I dove right into the pages. Sebold's writing style is magnificent and enchanting. The words jumped out at me, and it's a wonderful retelling of how she was able to rise above.The book starts out with the brutal and honest account of her rape, which occured in her freshman year of college. It follows all the way through the rest of her college years.The story was riviting and I reccomend it to everyone."
4,well written but horrific,"This was undoubtedly a well written book, however I have to say that I was scarred by it and that it gave me nightmares for over a week. Maybe that's a testament to the author's skill in describing a scene and transporting the reader."
5,Lucky,"This is a wonderful book. I'm usually not a reader of memoirs and thus my addiction to fiction brought me first to ""The Lovely Bones."" Sebold's novel, original and beautifully crafted, was one of the best books I'd read in years and her memoir, in terms of writing, is easily its equal. ""Lucky,"" with its unswerving frankness and heartbreaking honesty, surprasses it in many ways. Her themes here are similar -- how violence impacts not just the victim but family, friends and society at large -- but its deeply personal voice lends it even more power and resonance. I high recommend this."
4,Horrifyingly Detailed,"Sebold tells the story of her being raped at 17, its aftermath, the case, and how it affected people surround her and the rest of her life - socially, sexually, emotionally.The horrifying details made me cringe in disbelief, but she does it without imposing too much drama - matter-of-factly as if she's detached from it.She actually suffered from the trauma for many years and didn't even realize that. She went through it all and journeyed the recovery. And the brave soul finally found home."
5,Startling and Memorable,"I read The Lovely Bones prior to reading this memoir, and together these two books make for a powerful journey that crosses the lines of fiction and memoir. By itself, Lucky is a startling and sometimes horrific survival story. Alice Sebold describes her violent attack and the subsequent events in painful clarity. I found the descriptions of her family's and friends' reactions to be both disturbing and painfully real. After reading the book I was left with disgust of the judicial system, fear for young women on campuses everywhere, and respect for a talented writer who is able to cut through ""Law and Order"" type detail and tell her story with the perfect balance of heart and mind. My advice? Read them both."
4,A VERY REALISTIC MEMOIR OF A RAPE TRAUMA.,"I&#65533;m a seventeen year-old student from Boston, Massachusetts and I read &#65533;Lucky&#65533; by Alice Sebold as part of an assignment. Alice is a college freshman and the main character of this book. The first chapter describes how Alice gets raped in the entrance of an amphitheater. The author is very graphic and detailed and eventually she uses that narration form throughout the book. The story itself tells us how Alice had to deal with society&#65533;s lack of comprehension towards her rape and how her life changed after such a horrible experience. A sense of irony is added to the book when people constantly remind Alice how &#65533;lucky&#65533; she was that she survived the rape. I recommend this book; I found Alice Sebold&#65533;s memories to be very courageous, strong and realistic. You definitely will end up admiring the author of this literary piece."
4,Very moving,"I read Lucky for my senoir english class and really enjoyed it. It is brutal and honest, and would help any reader better understand rape and what happens to a person who experiences such a horrible thing. It is very well written and riveting"
4,Amazing first-hand account...,"I was captivated by this woman's story, and impressed with the courageous way she dealt with being raped. When most girls in her situation kept quiet and felt ashamed, Alice does the opposite. I felt a little cheated with how she described her life after the trial though. I finished the book wondering if her life is good now, or if she's depressed, alone, and suffering from substance abuse problems. I can't wait to read Lovely Bones now and see how that book compares."
2,Unlucky to have read it,"I was unimpressed with this book. It started off enthralling with her gripping description of the rape. However, after that, the book kind of went downhill. It's just a very drawn out story of how she dealt with her rape, which really it seems, she never did. It was rather boring."
2,disappointing,"I agree with the ""reader from New York."" I read Lucky a couple weeks ago, so it's not fresh in my mind, but the fact is, I really didn't learn much from it. Sebold talks plenty about her own life and her family, but the reader sees very little of her recovery process. The book is ultimately not so much about rape as it is about the author. This is not a bad thing in that it indicates that Sebold does not let the rape define her, but I think the book would be a much stronger piece of work if the author had made more of an effort to put her rape into a greater context and provided more perspective. Given that there are other memoirs by rape survivors out there, Sebold just doesn't give us enough reason to read hers. Nancy Venable Raine and Patricia Weaver Francisco both do much better."
2,lacking,"Alice Sebold is a great author, but when it comes to this book it lacks in excitment and is over detailed. The Lovely Bones is much much better to read. I don't really recommend this book."
5,Lucky is a great read,I ordered this book after reading The Lovely Bones. It started out a little graphic with the details of the rape she went through. But the rest of the story relates what the court system did to her and the reaction of those around her. It was extremely well written and kept me wanting to return to reading it as soon as I could. Anger is what I felt while fighting the battle right along with her. I admire her fortitude to keep going and fight for the right justice. I am very glad I read it and have shared it with many others.
4,Brave but Re-traumatizing,I began to read this book thinking that it would be interesting and a good read but it had a difficult affect on me. As a victim of rape myself I found it to be quite retraumatizing and I am trying to work out if I should work through it and continue to read or to put it down. It has already opened some pretty old wounds. It would almost be good to have some sort of disclaimer on the book so that the reader is prepared. It is well written though and I loved the Lovely Bones.
2,monotonous,"After reading many of the great reviews here, I was eager to get my hands on this book - I rushed to Borders and bought it brand new. The first couple of chapters were great, but then I lost interest. Still, I continued reading in hopes that the story would pick up pace, provide more personality and emotions. Instead, I found the tone of the book to be dull and boring. I gave up reading after page 145 (out of 243 pages). I had more fun in traffic school than reading this book."
2,It was OK,"The story was a good, strong story, but the read was so sloooow. She writes very well, but to me, it's seems so slow. Perhaps she needed more elaboration and interactions with the characters."
1,Too much Racial Profiling...,"I could not finish this book because of the constant references to ""My attacker was black"" or ""The rapist was an African-American man"".What difference does his ethnicity make? I found the author to be very racist..."
1,Editor Anyone?,I'm very surprised that this book has such good reviews! I was really looking forward to reading it only to find that the grammar and spelling mistakes fill this book so badly that I could not even stand to read it. If errors don't bother you then go ahead and give this a try but if you want to read a book that doesn't keep distracting you because of mistakes then I suggest you keep on searching.
5,Bold,This book was a page turner. The things that happened to her makes the life she lived more understandable. I praise her for all she had to go thru.
5,Powerful; good writing,"Sebold has not only told an amazing real-life story, but she has told it well. Her writing is excellent; unobtrusive, straight-forward, insightful."
5,a must read for attorneys in the field of criminal law,"Sebold takes us back stage, where the real battle is fought, and puts the court room drama in perspective. Attorneys so often get caught up in winning at all costs that they forget the human essence that drives the law. The author tears herself apart from the world of professional witnesses that seem to take center stage in today's trials, and shows us first hand what determination and a deeply rooted sense of decency and fair play can accomplish. Horray for the human spirit that can not only confront but also survive in an often times wicked system, and help breath life into our collective concept of justice. Courageous and fast paced, this is a must read for law students, prosecutors and defense attorneys."
5,Amazing,"As a Syracuse resident, reading this book was all the more difficult because Sebold does such an excellent job of bringing the city to life. Not only did I feel ""there"" during the attack, the investigation, and the court scenes, I now look at my city in a completely different way. The beautiful amphitheater at Thornden Park is now foreboding, the cultural center of Westcott darker, somehow. That is how real this memoir is. Alice Sebold sucked me into her world in 1981. This memoir was nail-bittingly intense, and, at times, poignantly funny. I couldn't put it down."
3,Okay,"This was certainly an interesting look at what happens after a rape. However, the end was conusing and not tied together well. I enjoyed the book but it's not something I want to read again. It goes into how her life went down the toilet, but not how she got back out."
1,"I read this because the blurbs said ""triumphant""","But Alice (in her own words) was not triumphant. After being raped as a reasonably well-raised 18-year-old college freshman, Alice spent years as a heroine addict, 10 years with undiagnosed post-traumatic stress disorder, and many, many years unwell. Not a happy life! Not even now does she seem to be well.As a recent rape survivor who had this book handed to me, please allow me to suggest that this book is NOT a good choice for those recently raped."
2,She is a one hit wonder...,"I hate to say it, but I LOVED the lovely bones, not impressed with this book. Did not keep my attention and she skipped around A LOT. It is wonderful she can write with such clarity about such a painful experience; however, the actual book, not that great."
5,Assault and Recovery,"Sebold has received justifiable acclaim for The Lovely Bones. It is doubtful if she could have written that without having had this horrific experience and written this superb book.She was raped as a college freshman at Syracuse, just before finals. This is the step-by-step story of that experience and its aftermath.Sebold is a rarely gutsy woman. She identified her attacker and stayed with the court process until he was imprisoned at Attica. Very few women have the courage to go through this process, which is perhaps as horrific as the event. Her own roommate had the same experience and opted out of pursuing it.Having done all that she had to take herself through her own recovery, through drug addiction and, how shall I say it, estrangement from normal sexual responses for a long time.This is a relentlessly honest volume.Not enough good things can come to Alice Sebold to make up for this experience, but one hopes that nothing but good things will."
5,Lucky,"Page turner could not put it down, great read, I love all of Alice Sebold. This lives up to her talent.."
5,An Excellent Memoir and Overall Read :),"The second you open Lucky and read the first few sentences, you are automatically hooked. This was my first time reading a story with this topic and was blown away. Lucky is a very well written story that conveys the confusion and meaningless of the attack Alice encounters and the effects it has on her, her friends and family, and the community. This book was an overall easy read although the description of the rape is very disturbing. This is a book that everyone both male and female should read for a better understanding of what is unfortunately an all too common occurrence for many people. The story helps us to comprehend the battle that sexual assault victims have to wage in order to reclaim their lives and identity and re-establish trust in the human race so they can begin to live without fear and terror of every person they meet."
4,A Painful Journey,Sebold describes in vivid detail the painful journey she unwantedly took as the victim of a vicious rape on her college campus. I reccomend that you read this book before you read her book LOVELY BONES as it gives incredible insight into the backgroud of her fiction.
4,A book that gives you hope,"After reading this book, I really do feel like I was given a bit of a gift, of hope. No, I haven't been raped, but just to know that someone who went through such a horrible thing and has come out on top, though struggling still I'm sure, is wonderful! I think it gives us all inspiration to move beyond the things that have held us down or hurt us. This book was a bit more than just Alice's rape- it was about her life, her family, her friends. It didn't overwhelm you with too much dialogue or pure reflection on the rape. This book is really a story. It's simple and pure. A read that I think I'm a bit better for."
4,Grimly fascinating,"The author went through a terrible experience, rape, and describes the experience in a way that makes you feel you are really there. She also takes you through the aftermath, including later identifying her rapist and going through a trial. It may be difficult stuff, but it needs to be said."
5,Made buying a car fun instead of a headache.,"This book does everything it claims to do.Years before I read the book, I bought a car (badly). I had done --everything-- wrong as described by the book. That purchase was not fun.After reading the book, the process of buying the next car was tense but fun.I really think the book allowed me to make a satisfactory deal and feel comfortable that I had made a good deal.Not a good book for those with un-realistic expectations about pricing. No matter how much you negotiate, the dealer will not sell you a car unless he makes a profit. You just don't want him to make too BIG a profit! The book will help with that limitation."
4,Really Good Workout,I found this book to very informative. The program will really get you into shape. I have never felt so good after a workout.
5,A truly extraordinary book!,"This is an extraordinary, rare and unique book about an autistic child. The thing that makes it this way, is his mother's pure and loving acceptance of him, just the way he is. His mother's creative solutions to make living with him the best it can be. Everyone having anything to do with an autistic child, should read it, if only for the different point of view. The view that every child has value, and there is something to be said for treasuring him just for who he is.Elijah is a fascinating child. He has been able to absorb much comprehension about the world, and his own disability, and how to cope, through his endless questioning of his mother, and her amazingly patient, honest, and encouraging replies. He will be an adult with a tremendous advantage over other children like him, for having had Valerie Paradiz for a mother."
5,A refreshingly different perspective from a parent,"This is a terrific story that chronicles the first 10 years of an autistic boy's life. The story starts like most accounts written by parents -- the nagging worries, the lack of language, the diagnosis, the struggle to teach the child. But then something different...Through a care-taker, the mother is shown that her son's differences are just part of what make him who he is. Instead of trying to illustrate treatments (like most ASD books written by parents), Elijah's mother just describes her journey through life, her search for knowledge & understanding of Asperger's and autism ...so that she can get to know her son better. Simply put, this is a book of love & acceptance."
4,better then a c-clamp,i bought this to replace my trusty c-clamp and it works nice and fast too but i think i might spring for the better model that looks like a caulking gun
2,Junk - You get what you pay for.,"This really didn't work for me at all. Not sure if it will work for other brake systems, but for a Nissan 350Z with standard brakes, this failed miserably. I gave it two stars because it didn't specifically state it would work with my car, so I can't ding it too hard, but per the text associated with 2 stars, ""I don't like it"". It was cheap, so that was nice. I'll chalk it up as a lesson learned and move on."
2,deceptive chapter titles,"The 1st third of the book provided enlightening ideas about starting a medical practice. However, the remainder of the book was disjointed and was not helpful to one considering starting a private practice."
1,"A-musing, but alas, not true.","Though Francine Prose's treatments of the nine women she has selected to call 'muses' make great reading, she has, in at least one case, preferenced a 'good story' over truth, scrambled some facts, misstated others, and based much of her information on the biased projections of previous biographers. If this is true for one, it casts doubts over the accuracy of her information for all. Prose is a gifted writer, yet, sadly, she negates the woman each time she choses to use the provocative, juicy, handed-down opinions of those previously determined to 'protect' the artist from the supposed femme fatale. Keeping these women safely tucked away as 'muses,' is a step backwards -- a lost opportunity to truly do justice to the separate lives and achievements of these remarkable women."
1,Muse-leading Very Misleading!,"If you are looking for a source in 19th and 20th century history don't bother. Francine Prose left one thing out. How did the muse inspire their artist? This book is packed with too much second hand history, no timeline and no focus on the muse herself. All I found written; a bunch of petty people with petty little lives with no focus on their art. This is one book that will not live on my bookshelf."
2,Bad recording,"OK, what do you get for $2.98? You can get some great guitar recordings (the complete works of Barrios on Naxos, for instance; Julian Bream's classical baroque festival; Essential Guitar - 2CDs) for somewhat cheap. This one comes without performers (in fact, the CD cover is a one-page leaflet, without performers or even composers). The recording quality is unequal, as if they put together a hodge-podge of what they could find. The recording of Albeniz is sufficient, just not good. Besides, what is a crowd-pleaser but completely uninteresting transcription of the Chopin, Moonlight sonata, or Ah! vous dirais-je Maman? (anything but virtuosic) doing in this CD? It's OK for ambiance (restaurant, shop) and that's about all."
5,must have,"This is great with the deck, excellent aid for any woman seeking to understand herself and her feminity."
4,This is a book you can share with your whole family.,"As I read HOW THE SPIDER BECAME BALD, I felt the passion and the strength of storytelling. There were lessons to be learned and a culture to be felt. This book is the essence of a good translation. I say this because the writer doesn't get caught up in jargon and rhetoric but finds it a necessity to develop aesthetics and the true NATURE of Ghana folklore. I could hear the storyteller speaking. Also, this is a book in which people of all ages can read for pleasure and be educated in African culture and terminology. As I read, I smiled a lot and found myself wanting to share this material with others. This is definitely a book to share with family and friends."
4,"Learn of Life and Self from Addo's ""Spider Became Bald""","There is much to learn from Ananse, the Spider, in Addo's retelling of these rich Aftican folktales. As a parent, grandparent, and elementary teacher, I find these stories to be little gems of wisdom to share with children and enjoy myself. We can all see ourselves in the humanity of Ananse -- sometimes wise, sometimes chagrined, sometimes clever, sometimes ""too big for his britches"", always with a lesson to learn. And we learn from other animals, too -- from the turtle to accept things that cannot be changed; from the earthworm that procrastination doesn't pay.Part of the fun is finding the familiar -- Uncle Remus's tar baby (or at least his cousin), the golden rule.... We are reminded of how much we share as citizens of one planet. Kudos to Addo for so ably sharing his heritage with us, allowing it to become part of ours."
5,Enjoyable and informative for children and adults.,"Children and adults will find this book, How the Spider Became Bald, enjoyable and informative. It shares the culture of West Africa and transmits wisdom and a philosophy that we can apply to our lives. Peter Eric Adotey Addo's presentation at the Benjamin Branch was, highly, received."
4,This is a book you can share with your whole family!!!,"This is a book you can share with your whole family. As I read HOW THE SPIDER BECAME BALD, I felt the passion and the strength of storytelling. There were lessons to be learned and a culture to be felt. This book is the essence of a good translation. The writer doesn't get caught up in jargon and rhetoric but finds it a necessity to develop aesthetics and the true NATURE of Ghanaian folklore. The stories were filled with life, and I could hear the storyteller speaking. As I read, I smiled and found myself wanting to share this material with others, and I did share. It not only entertains, but it educates. This is definitely a book to share with family and friends."
5,"awesome, excellent, great for kids of all nationalities",I came upon this book as I was doing research for a paper. I found it to be a great example of African folklore and have recommended this book to my friends and their children. This book is for all people of all ages. When's the next one coming out??
4,Christmas Gift,This was a Christmas gift to someone who travels quite a bit and likes to have room to pick up things along the way to bring home. He was very happy to with his gift and what makes him happy makes me happy.
1,"Good ideas, poorly executed","I bought this bag for my summer vacation last year, and it lasted exactly one trip. By the time I got home, the handle would no longer retract into its sleeve. My husband took it apart and found that a single plastic/nylon part had broken, making the whole bag useless as a rolling duffel. That part probably cost a few cents, and probably could have been made better for only a few cents more, but for want of that one essential part, the whole thing was useless. Maddening. I won't buy this brand again."
3,Sometimes Confused with Majestic Moods CD,"There is another Guitar by the Sea CD by Magestic Moods produced by Steve Gruskin with John Foley on Guitar, copyright 1995. These two cd's are sometimes confused. The Gruskin CD contains 9 tracks while this cd has 15 tracks. If anyone is interested in obtaining the Gruskin CD, please check out this Amazon link where I was able to purchase the correct cd and submit a review. I hope this helps.Link:http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CER5G6/ref=ox_ya_oh_product"
5,Awesome CD!,"I've had this CD for years and it became scratched and I was sick about it so I was thrilled to find another one to replace it. The music is so soothing and relaxing, my most favorite CD."
4,Information and a Great Many Laughs,"Whad'Ya Knowledge is a party in paperback. It's jammed with trivia and punctuated with one-liners. The only thing better would be hearing it live.The chapters are divided into the categories for the Whad'Ya Know quiz: People, Places, Odds & Ends, Science, Things You Should Have Learned in School, and Current Events. Each chapter begins with an essay by Feldman relative to the overall topic and peppered liberally with his signature wit.This isn't a book for solid reading, but it's a slim and entertaining volume that's great to have when you're waiting in line, getting together with friends, and when you're in desperate need for a game to play with the kids on a long drive (OK, they won't get most of the jokes, but you'll have fun for a while). Bonus: Some of these have appeared on the Whad'Ya Know web site quiz!"
5,"""World Renown Timbalero - Joe Torres is back!""",I highly recommend this recording and recordings like this! Very flavorful in sound and music. From the first beat to the last! I'm proud to be a friend of Mr. Joe Torres. I wish you alot of sales and airplay Bro! Buena Suerte!
4,A Great Tribute to the Robert Johnson Songbook,"There's a lot of blues tribute records out there, from blues bands covering Jimi Hendrix and Led Zepplin, but my favorite of the spate of tribute discs is Dealin' With the Devil, featuring blues men and women paying homage to Robert Johnson, one of the early defining players in the blues. I especially like Pinetop Perkins, Guy Davis, Sue Foley, and Dave Van Ronk's contributions to this disc. If you're new to the Robert Johnson songbook, check this disk out. If you're like me and enjoy the music of early bluesmen like Charley Patton and Elmore James, go and get Dealin With the Devil."
1,Worst I have read,"Byrd's book is hands down the most superficial and misleading book I have ever read on the topic of homosexuality. He is either unable to understand the information on which he reports, or he is purposefully misrepresenting the work of many experts in the understanding of homosexuality. He seems to be intent upon taking advantage of naive family members who hope against hope that homosexuality can be cured. The results of this kind of pandering can only be damaging on the individual and on family relationships. Byrd has proven himself again and again to place his own personal agenda over that of the people he claims he desires to help."
1,Don't Buy This!,Anyone who is a fan of Lars Ulrich will not be a fan of this dvd. The cover makes the consumer feel as if it's going to be Lars walking us through HIS own grooves. NOT THE CASE! Nathan Kilen is the only one on camera. Don't let boxes deceive you! Drums are tuned badly and explanations are not full. Very disappointing!
1,"Nice Box Cover, Nothing Else","This DVD simply sucks. The ""Drummer"" Nathan Kilen only shows 1-3 licks of each song and explains the time signatures for a ridiculous 4 minutes. The instructions for each song only last for 6-7 minutes. Even if you've just bought a drum set and don't have a clue on how to play drums, I still wouldn't recommend this DVD to you. You learn much more by watching Metallica's live shows and listening to the actual songs, including the drum fills and the time signatures Lars Ulrich uses. Don't let yourself be fooled by the nice box cover, because this DVD is a low budget rip-off. ""Step-by-step"", that's what The New Kids on the Block also said"
4,"Here Come The Dead, All Dressed In Black...","Horror legend Paul Naschy stars as the eastern mystic, Krischna. He's a laid-back guru dude w/ a mellow groov-itude. Unfortunately, his eeevil twin brother (Naschy) is not so meek. He's out to destroy those who have wrecked his life by raising nubile women from the dead and outfitting them w/ sheer, black, granny nightgowns! VENGEANCE OF THE ZOMBIES is a rib-tickler from start to finish. Worth owning for any / all Naschy addicts! The dream sequence w/ Naschy as satan, complete w/ awesome antlers, is a classic!..."
3,"Buy It For The Book, Not The Music","Many Ramones fans will be disappointed by the song selection on this compilation. With the exception of ""Carbona Not Glue"" and ""(And)I Don't Wanna Live This Life"", every songs has already been released on CD. Where are the hard-to-find b-sides like ""Smash You"", ""Go Home Ann"", ""Chop Suey"", and ""Can't Say Anything Nice""? Where are the unreleased demo songs that exist? The book is great, though. Lots of great photos and information. Guess we'll have to wait for the REAL box set..."
1,"over-rated, no chops","OK, sorry for his passing, but after reading his criticism of Kansas, along with the erroneous association w/ foreigner & Boston, I had to take a listen...a bit too simple and poorly played to hold my interest...if some folks who had troublesome adolescent periods connect with the emotional sentiment, fine..whatever gets you through...but hey, ho, joe, let's hold back the criticism unless you can even PLAY what you're deriding!"
4,"Hey Ho, Let's Go! Hey, Ho, Let's Go!","Can you believe these guys have been around for twenty years? An excellent overview of their entire career including a hardbound CD booklet providing exhaustive details about Joey, Dee Dee, Johnny, Tommy, Marky, CJ, and Richie. While All The Stuff and Ramones Mania are probably more consistant CDs, this is a worthy purchase. It shows how far you can go with only three chords!Maybe they should consider a ""Rarities"" release, too."
5,The Best Punk-Rock Band in the World,"I think is the great compilation, all the singles, all the hits, but why cant not include all the sides b of their singles or maxis, rare versions or maybe unreleased songs (in WWW you can find many mp3 archives). I hope that The Ramones do it, i think all fans want it."
5,The most influential band of all time!,"This is an awesome cd set, with all the best of the Ramones (some of their best still missing, though) It shares all the best hits of the most influential band of all time (except the beatles)who changed the face of rock and saved us from that bloated mid-70's rock. Where would rock be without the ramones? It shares johnny's ripping droning chords mixed with joeys punching voice and simple lyrics, dee dee's mixing bass lines and tommy's simple yet still so amazing drums. The Ramones changed it all, brought us all together and influenced many other great bands. We will never forget joey! Gabba Gabba Hey!!"
5,NYC Punk Legends/ Geniouses!!!,"This is what started punk rock in the U.S. This is what started the NYC Hardcore movement. This is the greatest punk/ rock n roll band ever to walk the earth. This is The Ramones. Must have for any real music lover, buy now!!!"
5,I just wanna have something to do,"This is a great collection of Ramones music. 2 discs, 58 songs, can't beat that. The best songs on Disc One are Beat on the Brat, Judy Is a Punk, Now I Wanna Sniff Some Glue, I Wanna Be Sedated, and Do You Remember Rock & Roll Radio? Disc Two has some good ones as well such as Psycho Therapy, Howling at the Moon, I Wanna Live, and Pet Sematary. Forget all the so-called poppy ""punk"" today such as Simple Plan and check out the real deal...The Ramones!"
4,This is great ... but ...,"This is a great collection of Ramones songs, but if you are a true fan , you should already have all these songs on other albums of theirs. For someone first wanting to listen to the Ramones, this is a great choice (along with a few other compilations ... too many!)I would love to see some of the stuff that I have on 12 inch singles by the Ramones on some more accessible CDs (Street Fighting Man, etc). But all in all, you can truly never have too many Ramones CDsGabba-Gabba-Hey!"
5,""" I only know three chords ""","1-2-3-4 ,Three chords under 3mins, On 2 CD's ,58 songs at over a 155 minutes with a book!!!, Taking you to the birth of the Ramones.This CD also includes the song ""Carbona Not Glue"" that was on the Leave Home album and was pulled and replaced with ""Sheens is a punk rocker""Making this a great collection of tunes from a great long lasting punk rock bandBoth CD's are in a slim line jewel case.R.I.P Joey and Dee DeeYou will be missed!Enjoy!"
4,Blitzkrieg Pop,"I am a fairly new fan of The Ramones, and after downloading some essential songs online, I bought the anthology as my first Ramones purchase. I must say I'm glad I finally opened up to this great band. Although I am not a fan of punk music, (not by today's standards anyway) I really enjoy listening to these melodic upbeat songs. The band incorporates ultra memorable hooks, unique vocal deliveries, and simplistic chord stylings, and when everything is in place, its a synergy. Musically its simple, but the songs are instantly invigorating. The only down side to the group, is that some of the songs sound similar, but that just comes with the territory, especially considering the (intentional) primitive back bone of the songs.Whether you're a hardcore Ramones fan, or just starting to discover them (like me) this album will prove a very worthy purchase.Dan."
3,why bother?,"The Ramones have 20 years of b-sides they could have released. Why release a longer Ramonesmania?I would have loved to get Chop Suey or the Sedated megamix or maybe some live versions of songs they stopped doing years ago... like Time Has Come TodayIt's nice to see Carbona on something, but I've had it for years. Come on guys.... what are you saving all the good stuff for? I have all this stuff on other things, any real Ramones fan does. I also have the mega mix and Chop Suey, but it would have been nice to have a real copy and not some cd burner stuff that I made off my vinyl."
4,Not Enough Room,"The Ramones are good, maybe too good for this 'greatest hits' Anthology. There just isn't enough room to include other songs that should've been here: Where is, I Don't Wanna Be Learned/I Don't Wanna Be Tamed, I Don't Wanna Go Down to the Basement,Havana Affair, Baby Sitter, Your'e Gonna Kill that Girl, Oh, Oh, I Love Her So, We're a Happy Family, Slug, it goes on and on. If you really like the Ramones you should get their first four albums. All that Stuff and More Vol. 1 and 2 is a really good option that includes more of their early material not found on this anthology. Until the Ramones make it to DVD Audio, there is not going to be definite compilation. However, this is still an excellent, overall anthology!"
5,"Bad boys then, bad boys now","This 2 CD collection features 58 of the Ramones classic songs. Of course, even with that many songs, a few fan favorites were bound to get left off. A few that come to mind are ""Today Your Love, Tomorrow the World"", ""Suzy is a Headbanger"", ""Do You Wanna Dance?"" and ""Questioningly"". But this is still a solid overview of the Ramones career. (Even with nothing from the unpopularAcid Eatersalbum included.) Highly Recommended."
5,Portable Ramones,"I was there at the beginning and own all the vinyl. Then it was on cassettes. Now I'm old and tired, but the music isn't. You need to have this anthology to play in your car, on the subway, in the gym, while you walk around. It's essential. Yeah, they were punk. Yeah, they were pop. Yeah, they are the East Coast Beach Boys. The pride of NYC & Forest Hills, Queens. If you are that worried about what isn't on this compilation, show me your LPs or shut up."
3,Random spattering of PL/SQL technique,"This book seemed more like a few seemingly random techniques and tasks that PL/SQL is suited for rather than diving into more general and yet advanced programming. It was useful to gleam some of the ideas used, but it seemed more like longwinded and specific tasks using PL. The book was otherwise organized and well written.If you need to buy just one book diving into advanced techniques look elsewhere, but for someone with a large collection this may be a good addition."
2,Not what I needed,"As a professional PL/SQL developer, I try to keep abreast of the latest and greatest techniques for accomplishing what my clients need done. This book did not provide me with much I could use. Most of it is the kind of obscure bit-twiddling that Object Oriented gurus seem to revel in. If you are a Java or C fan that wants to beat the procedural/relational PL/SQL language to fit into your OO world, you may like this book better than I did. There was some good info about tuning, but I would not buy the book for that alone."
5,Veronica,This is truley a great album. My favorite tracks are 1 and 3. Johnny Vicious does an excellent job and the vocals are so sweet. Jellybean is such a great producer and this cd pumps. This is a great buy and I recommend it to everyone. You will not be dissapointed AT ALL! Five Stars.
5,Something to Hold and Play Over and Over,This is the ultimate CD for Veronica fans. The Johnny Vicious Mix of Someone to Hold is simply the best dance mix of all time. That mix alone is worth the price of this CD.
4,You never think of the life your doctor leads,"Compassion is the core word for this book. You read, see, and enjoy the passion of compassion as Drs. Cavens let you enter into their life. The only thing missing was the a picture of the author's good looking brother, Pastor Rick Cavens, and his family"
4,Top Notch,Very good best of package from a great band. The only thing keeping this from a five star rating is the exculsion of Unchain the Night(how could they do that?).
1,THE VERY WORST OF DOKKEN,"It's impossible to have an album called ""The Very Best of Dokken"" , because they don't have any good song, only some sparks of great guitar playing by George Lynch."
1,BAD,"DOKKEN was a band cretaed since the start with the intentions of copying whateve was in fashion at the moment. In their case, fashion was ""glam"" metal, one of the worst things that ever existed on Earth. So, DOkken rided along RATT, CINDERELLA, POISON, MOTLEY CRUE, WASP, WHITE LION and other trash like these... Sad..."
3,VERY BEST?,"This is a good place to start if you're new to Dokken. It has a lot of their best known songs. The problem I have is that Don's solo song and ""Too High To Fly"" take up space that would've been better used by ""Unchain The Night"", ""Kiss Of Death"", ""Prisoner"", or ""When Heaven Comes Down"". I believe those songs belong on the ""very best of"" cd. Other than that everything is good. The liner notes are ok and the sound is good. George Lynch's guitar playing is some of the best you'll ever hear, too bad him and Don can't get along."
4,Does what I want it to do.,"I read the reviews here on Amazon and was kind of turned off of buying it at first. Eventually I went ahead and sprung for it since it wasn't expensive. I only needed one, and expected the package to come with just one, but it has two locks so that was a pleasant surprise. I've had them for 2-3 months now and they haven't failed me yet. They keep the strap in place just fine and are fairly sturdy for plastic pieces. Really helped a lot because my strap would keep slipping off the knob and I had to use my ninja skills to get the guitar before it hit the floor. The only complaint I have is that they fit a bit tight with my strap (though it could be my nylon strap is just a bit too thick) and they are an EXTREMELY snug fit which makes me kinda nervous. However, I keep them as tight as I can while still allowing them to rotate a bit so everything is fine so far. Not sure why the other reviews were so negative, but I have no complaints."
5,Added Security,"The strap button on my SG is behind the body, at the base of the neck. The strap had slipped off the button once or twice while I was playing, and although I didn't drop the guitar, it made me determined to find a solution. I ordered the dunlop strap lock, and it works great! It fits perfectly on my guitar, and now my strap stays on!"
2,Not That Great,"Works Ok with thin straps.Thicker quality leather straps causes pieces to separate.To make it worse, Sam Ash had em for 75 cents apiece.Just not a quality product."
5,Met my expectations!,"I bought these for my Yamaha Acoustic FG Series, I was always worried that the strap alone would somehow come off the strap button and damage my guitar.That was the sole reason i bought this. No more worrying. You can be sure that your strap wouldn't come undone with the strap buttons.Some would say that these are of bad quality, well it's just made of plastic, nothing special.The reason for buying this would be if you want a lock strap and you don't want to replace all the strap buttons on your guitar for a set metal strap locks, this would do it.I've used it for more than a month now and have been playing my guitar everyday except for weekends and it doesn't prove to be breaking or cracking.I just think that for a small piece of plastic, they could hopefully sell these for a much lower price.Overall, I'm satisfied with this plastic ergo strap lock!"
1,Definitely not worth the cost.,"Do they work? Mostly.Are they cheaply made pieces of plastic garbage? Definitely.Perhaps if these were made out of a better material, they would be good. As it stands, this is made out of two cheap pieces of plastic (one of mine cracked). Then there's the cost factor. There is no way this $0.10 worth of plastic should sell for $4. That's an obscene price for such a low quality product. I will never buy this again, and would caution others to steer clear of this."
3,Would not close around my epi LP strap buttons with my strap.,Unless you have a very thin strap this is not going to work so well. It goes on but will not turn and fully latch. I'm going with the dunlop dual design.
2,"Great concept, poor material.","The concept id great, but the product itself is made of plastic and comes apart. I wont trust my Les Paul's safety to this device. When I put it on, it came apart, but I have thicker straps. If it were sturdier (metal perhaps) even if that raised the price, it would be perfect."
3,Caution - Made for thin straps only,"When it comes to preventing guitars from detaching from the strap locks, these are one of the best. Dunlop also manufactures a circular version rather than the one shown here which is more like a oversize guitar pick. Both are equally good but my preference favors the circular shaped on since when you move and twist with your instrument, the strap locks move along rather than binds whenever you encounter any sharp or even round edges.Also, you can only use them if you are using thin guitar straps much like the ones made by Ernie Ball which are woven and thin. Anything thicker than 1/8"" would be a real knuckle buster since it becomes almost impossible to turn the dial clockwise in order to lock and secure the strap. And if you do manage to rotate the dial through a lot of finger pressure, imagine the difficulty when try to remove the strap. Very painful and downright difficult."
3,does the job,This product is fine.. It's a bit hard to turn the safe lock but overall it locks the strap and your guitar won't fall if you are a normal player.. but if you are a angus young like player i dont recomend it because it is a bit plasticky and it doesnt seem to be that strong...
1,Do not buy.,"The product itself is not in question here. I like the product, and bought it previously from a different website. If you live in the United States, I would recommend you buy this product else where. There is no way to track your shipment, and the wait is awful. My shipment estimate was to be from Jan 18-Feb 5. It is now Feb 9 and I have not received anything. I am highly disappointed with this company. I will find a way to be refunded! Meanwhile, I will have to order this product from the other website I usually use. I used Amazon this time because I had gotten a gift card for Christmas. I wasted most of it on NOTHING!!!! I am incredibly angry with this company!"
5,Great Read!,"I bought this book for my 11yo son to do a book report on. He really enjoyed it. He said that he ended up feeling like he was reading it for fun and it did not feel like a ""school thing"" at all."
5,THE LIFE THAT CHANGED BASEBALL,"I've been reading Stealing Home the story of Jackie Robinson. I liked this book because I am a huge baseball fan and I've always looked up to Jackie Robinson. Most Characters in the book were cruel to Jackie by racism, so I didn't really like most of them. I really liked Branch Rickey because he is the one who drafted Jackie and integrated baseball.This book was about Jackie Robinson and how his life changed baseball. Jackie grew up as a poor, young boy and his father had walked out on him. As he grew up it was just he, his mom, his sister, and his two brothers. As he went through college Jackie was a football and basketball star. Later after college he went to the army where he then played baseball in the Negro Leagues. Later, Branch Rickey would draft him to play in the Major Leagues."
2,sorry to say it...,"I've read a lot of Kerouac's stuff and liked most of it. this, however, is truly pathetic, uninteresting and unnecessary. I guess if you for some reason need a portrait of the artist in decline... this is it.If you've never read him please dont start here. This is only for those who already love and know what jack was capable of- we're better prepared to forgive disappointments like these. If you're new to kerouac do yourself a favor and start with things like the dharma bums, on the road and subterraneans- there's a reason these are as popular as they are.It's nice and short, though.I also want to mention that this is my first review- I'm not in the habit of trashing great writers lesser works. I dont need my opinions heard or validated. I just want to steer fledgling beat readers away from what could be an instant kerouac dealbreaker."
3,Sad Drunken Ramblings,"There's no Satori here. No Dharma bums or Dharma either. Just the sad druken ramblings of a once great writer. Gone is the energy and excitement of On The Road and The Dharma Bums. And there's no interesting characters like Neal Cassady or Gary Snyder for Kerouac to bounce off of. Its just poor druken Kerouac wandering through France in an inebriated haze. And also this book was written in the mid sixties, the Beat Generation was well past its prime, already eclipsed by its progeny, the flower children. And unlike Allen Ginsburg, Gary Snyder and Neal Cassady, Kerouac was hopelessly out of touch with the times. And it shows. That's not to say that Satori in Paris is without interest, just that it pales in comparison with his earlier work. And Pic is an example of an interesting early experiment. I believe an early draft of On The Road, before he quite got his bearings and figured out how to write that masterpiece."
2,Fuhgetaboudit,"These are the essential New York songs that should have replaced almost every song on this collection:1) New York, New York (Frank Sinatra, Gene Kelly and Jules Munshin)2) The Brooklyn Bridge (Frank Sinatra)3) Lullaby of Broadway (The Andrews Sisters)4) Forty-Second Street (The Boswell Sisters)5) Take Me Back to New York Town (Billy Murray)6) Streets of New York (Billy Murray)7) Give My Regards to Broadway (Billy Murray/George M. Cohan)8) Theme From ""New York, New York"" (Frank Sinatra)This collection pretty much sucks."
3,Parental Guidance needed - at least,"My 5 year old loves Jeff Corwin, animal planet, and animals in general. Unfortunatley, some of the language choices in this video are inappropriate for the little ones."
1,Disappointment,I only received the middle part of which I had no use for it is deceiving I thought I would be getting everything in the picture and did not get the soles portion which is the majority of it.
3,Not to thrilled...,"Don't get me wrong, I have alot of respect for Unwed Sailor. Maybe I expected to much. Its just that this alblum lacks some much needed dynamics. The idea behind the record is solid, and at times you may feel involved in the story. I would have to say that Dave Basan was much needed, but did not play on the CD. I recommend any of there earlier stuff or 'Explosions in the Sky'."
2,iffy,"This album is a bit of a break from their previous work: instead of the lush, standard-length songs, this album is comprised primarily of short, stark little vignettes. Interesting, but I wouldn't recommend it."
4,Instrumental Music that You Can Sing Your Heart Out to,"I first heard of Unwed Sailor by listening to Pedro the Lion and hearing of David Bazan's side project. After hearing some samples via iPod services, I realized how much I enjoyed the soft instrumental and the lush landscapes that the CD created. This proved to be the soundtrack to my summer. The highlights of the CD are The Windmill's Tale of the Music Box Floats Through the Air, Riding the Windmill and the closer, Jubilee. All in all, a very well put together CD."
1,What a little dinky book,"This is the second book I have ordered in this series that arrived and a little dinky book about 1/3rd the size of the regular coffee table book. How can you even see the details? I won't have this happen again, I will check dimetions before I buy."
5,Good Cure for Secret Ignorance,"I have long been secrety embarrassed by my lack of knowledge about Egypt beyond the usual touristy stuff -- even though I spent some weeks there once seeing the sights and even though, more recently, I've recognized in sidelong ways that Egypt's modern history and in particular its struggle to cope with repeated waves of Islamicist extremism within its borders offers a lesson very relevant for those of us now trying to understand the Post-9/11 world. Murphy cured me of my ignorance with her compelling descriptions and analyses of the forces -- political, religious, cultural -- that have shaped that land.She does so in part with smart use of colorful characters she got to know during her time covering the region as a Washington Post reporter, and from scads of research... Cleanly organized, thorough, insightful. A very helpful and yet enjoyable read."
3,Leggo Harry Potter Rescue from Merpeople,"My son absolutely loved this toy. Unfortunatly, some of the pieces are very small and easily fall off the toy. After a short time period, too many pieces were missing. Because of this, my son hardly plays with the toy anymore."
3,"Beautiful, but didn't fare well shipping","The collection is gorgeous, I would have given it 5 stars. But the stable broke in three pieces. Nothing hot glue couldn't fix, but I didn't want to have to give a 'repair' as a Christmas gift. The figurines shipped with no problem. Again, beautiful."
2,Try to find this item from someone else.,"Along with my previous review I have received my creche and figurines and the creche was SMASHED into several pieces. The packaging was totally insufficient. My husband spent a whole afternoon gluing and repairing. It did arrive before Christmas (was ordered on Dec. 2 and came Dec. 22). Also, the carved figurines look like they were ""hurredly"" sprayed with finish because it does not completely cover all the surfaces. For the money...my husband and I expected more."
5,INCREDIBLE!!,"Was FLOORED by the amazingness of this soda!! Natural, carbonated, not too sweet, authentic, feels like the way soda was before mass market products. Great mouth feel and nice dark appearance with an almost stout beer head and look at first pour. Will be in my normal rotation of beverages!!"
3,"Good, but not as good as the older one.","I bought this to replace a friends worn out older Big Screen Tetris from the same manufacturer. The older one lasted 7 years of regular gameplay before giving up the ghost. This one's screen died in about a year. It works fine, but if you find the older style, then snag it first."
4,Excellent singer!,"Sertab became well-known in Europe after she won Eurovision with her hit song ""Everyway that I can"". It's by far the best song she's realised, but she does have some other good songs as well."
2,Kinda boring,"The dvd is meant to motivate you, but it is more boring then anything else. They try to make it fast paced to get you pumped up, but it just comes off as annoying. To be honest I only bought this because I am a saints fan. Its not really worth the buy."
2,Disappointing book,Great if your in a corporate enviroment with 40 pople to co-ordinate. If your a lone web site designer then this book is dry and I can not recommend it.
5,Search Engine Advertising,A important book that make easy the pratice of search engine strategies and maximizes your advs budget- I think so
5,A must-have for a web developer's bookshelf,"I'm a web designer branching out into search engine optimization and marketing so that I can provide my clients the full package. This is just the book I need. The material is current, proven reliable, and covers everything I need to know to create a winning site, from design to dollars. I can't recommend it enough. Many thanks to the authors."
5,"Excellent, practical how-to guide","This book is great for both the corporate marketer with big resources AND the small business trying to grow big on the cheap (that would be us). Includes explanations of terms, sources for web tools, walks you through how to measure the success of your campaign efforts and even rationale for gaining buy-in in the corporate setting. Yes, it is detailed and comprehensive (off-putting for some) but simply focus on the issues of importance for you. Our website, [...], could be better, but we did avoid many pitfalls of internet marketing thanks to this book. It also helped us in working with our outsourced webmaster, who is not an SEO expert. Also check out Do It Wrong QuicklyDo It Wrong Quickly: How the Web Changes the Old Marketing Rules (IBM Press), which I am reading now."
2,Haunted Waters-Confusing!,"I rated this book two stars because it was really too hard to follow, and it used a lot of words I did not know. The book was about a maiden from a poor family who was really the daughter of the Sea King. But how did she become human? Her purpose was to see what love was like, but don't they know what love is like under the water? One day a man named Lord Holdbrand came to their families pennisula after spending one minute with her, he fell deeply in love with her by some mysterious power. They married and lived happily in their castle, or so they thought. The one point I forgot to tell you is that there was a ghost that haunted the pennisula, and now it followed her to the castle. What is it, why does it want from her? Those are the questions that raced through my mind. This book was good but hard to understand. I encourage you to read this book and maybe you can understand it better then I did."
4,"Spare, Atmospheric Tale of Enchantment","Based upon the novel ""Undine"" written in the early 19th century by Friedrich Heinrich Karl, this short novel is spare and seems almost primative. The dialog is simple, the characters not very deep, but it has atmosphere in abundance and romance and obsession. It is the sad tale of a nobleman who is beguiled and ultimately falls in love with a mysterious young woman. It reads almost like a myth or a legend. It draws you into its pages and treats you to emotional ambiance that you won't soon forget. Some elements of the tale are never fully explained, but I did not find that to be a necessity because it is very dream-like or similar to being held under a spell. Anyone who has lived under an enchantment will understand. Read it and see for yourself. It is lovely."
1,This printer stinks.,"I have over the years had (and survived) with several different makes/types of low cost printers and hands down this is the worst one I have ever bought. The printer is an especial source of frustration when I am trying to print envelopes. I wanted to like this printer after having mixed results with HP and certainly liked the price, but have regreetted my decision to purchase this product after usi9ng for a couple days."
2,What was left out of 'Forever Amber' ..,"This is a hopelessly naive and romantic novel, which nevertheless can engage the reader through the sheer force of its narrative. It is altogether obvious that Winsor would have liked to include scenes of explicit eroticism in her earlier novel, 'Forever Amber' yet was constrained by contemporary morals: it seems that she has made up for her earlier frustration by writing this later book which is virtually one long sex scene. It is a shame that Winsor could not allow Robert to remain a genuine gypsy; a shame also that Arabella takes a consistently subservient role in sexual activities. All the same, there is a bravery and verve about the novel which makes it worth reading, if only as a curiosity."
5,SILLY REVIEWS,"Is it literature, is it deadly accurate? Who cares? What a great story, not one wasted word. Terrific characters, terrificdialogue, and very original story. Terrific work, Mr. Grippando."
3,jackeroo wrote my review,"As I read Jackeroophillip's review, I thought ""This is almost word for word what I would write."" Thanks, Jack. We think exactly alike on this one."
5,A King's Ransom Captured Me from Cover to Cover,"Having read all of Jim Grippando's books and loved each of them from start to finish, I found that A King's Ransom once again captured me at the onset of the story and kept me thrill-bound to the end. If you are looking for a great new book with a fascinating and intriguing plot, this is it! But be warned - you will not put it down until you have reached the end so plan your next morning accordingly!"
5,While passion sleeps,"One of the best love story I have read so far,well written with just the right amount of the things that make a book exciting.Does have love, sex and danger.If you are a fan of Lisa Kleypas and Judith McNaught I think you will like this book very much."
4,Not really the ulimate but good,"I should have noticed the publisher of this book; the format and style is very much like ""Knit it your way"" which showed several different sweaters knit in 2 different yarns. All the yarns were Trendsetter yarns and it's not a huge leap to see that knitting in cotton is different from knitting in wool. In this one, once again many of the designs are knit in high-end yarns, mostly Trendsetter, and sometimes combinations that would be difficult to match. However, the classic Tee is knit in many different ways, side-to side, top down, etc. and the instructions and diagrams are much better than the previous book. I'm sure I will find it useful for the non-traditional designs, but there are a lot more useful patterns for the basic Tee out there."
3,"Hmm, shouldn't this be offered as an audiobook?","I'd love to get this for my dad, who has recently gone blind, but it's not on audiobook, and guess what, he's blind and can't read."
1,Load of rubbish,"My goodness, I don't recall any of this as a young girl. Never played any of the games mentioned. Does not resonate with me in any way whatsoever."
5,Excellent ball bearing,works great! Fits my router bits and shafts just fine and it rotates freely and this should be enough words ...
2,Hire a New Composer for This Talented Singer!!!,"By the middle of the 5th track, I was ready to swap out the CD! As a new listener to Laura Pausini, I was mesmerized by her bright voice and at the same time saddened by the monotonous tunes, track after track. Laura Pausini would be much better showcased by borrowing song writres from Celene Dion and even Britney Spears. And I agree with other reviewers that Gilberto Gil should not have a singing career, definitely not with Laura!"
2,Not the original entonation!,"After time some artists like to modify the way they perform hits with an imposted, artificial, different style, if you are looking for the original songs this is not the album for you ... :("
4,She deserved a collection!!!!,"...I was really waiting for a compilation cd from laura.I think that, at this point,she really has so many hits to sing to us, that it would even be not possible to put them all together. However, the selected tracks for this cd are really good. ""volvere junto a ti"" and ""dos historias iguales"" (the new songs) are beatiful...it reflects laura's unique style and her sweet but strong voice. She sounds so romantic.She puts so much soul ate the time of singing... you can hear how she ""feels"" what she is singing. about the re-arrangements for new versions with her firts hits (like ""la soledad, ""amores extranos"", etc. ) are not bad. but I would definitely always prefer the original versions. oh! I couldn't go without mentioning ""dime"": really nice and different. Laura and jose el frances voices sound great together!!!! a cd really good, specially for collectors..."
4,Why?!?,"I was so glad to be able to own her earliest songs in just one cd so when I saw it at Wal Mart I bought. But, I love her song La Soledad and i just don't like the new background music on it. This was a great song that didn't need any change. Even so it still sounds good and as for the new version of se fue i love it.Then amores extranos was RUINED.I'm really upset about this.Thankfully the rest of the songs are great and the cd includes a great english song called One More Time."
5,Volvere Junto a Laura,"Laura Pausini is one of the best Latin Music singers of this day. An Italian, Laura has broken Latin Music's Pop en Espanol charts time after time and continues to deliver comtemporary pop to her fans. Her strong sweet voice commands attention and yet her intonation is truly music to the ears. Whether you understand spanish or not, you will understand Laura Pausini's music through her melody and emotion.Out of 17 tracks on this CD in English, Spanish and Italian, I have 4 favorites, of which all 4 made the charts. Those are tracks 1, 3, 4 and 14 which are Volvere Junto a Ti, Se Fue, Amores Extranos and Entre Tu y Mil Mares, respectively.I recommend this CD along with all others by Laura Pausini to everyone and to everyone that appreciates foreign languages and great music."
4,"great continuation of ""Wings of Winter""","P. F. Kosak has done it again. The continuation of ""Wings of Winter"" is just as riveting as the first one. I couldn't put it down."
3,May I have your attention please?,"This was the 2000 release of L.A. based radio station KROQ's annual Christmas CD. It is a mixture of Christmas songs and comedy skits. It is somewhat more uneven than usual. The comedy bits are funny for the most part. I especially like ""Santa Claus: Behind the Magic"", ""Batman: The Lost Christmas Episode"", ""Shaq the Halls"" and two Santa Claus related Eminem parodies. As for the songs, there are some good ones, but there are also a few bad ones. Either way, some of the songs are unavailable elsewhere, so if you want them you'll have to get this CD."
4,"Baptism, Why Wait : Faith's Response in Conversion","Dr. Bryant's analysis of this topic is refreshing, admist a sea of various interpretations and controversies. His approach to the subject is very much like his teaching style: gentle, yet direct and relevant. His work is worth reading, not only for its new look on an old subject, but also because of its personal application. This is a book not only for theologians, but for those who have a hunger to understand more clearly the doctrine of baptism."
5,Educational and fun,"My 1.5 y/o twins love this mantis! I try to get them educational toys so that they learn more about the world beyond our house. We watched a video of mantis catching crickets and now they pretend that it is hunting. The felt parts collect dust easily and need some cleaning when the toy comes out of the dryer, otherwise the toy is excellent."
3,Detailed puppet,"Great finger puppet for small children. There is a lot of detail, but not much moves. Will look for more of this type from this company."
3,a bit dated,"the insights and advice given relating to women's loneliness seem a little outdated for women living in the 21st century. I believe it was written in the 60's , just as woman were beginning to to break out of the old traditional roles."
5,Love it,This is a useful size for washing dishes or gathering tomatoes from the garden. We use to it put shelled peas in and wash out small laundry items by hand. Very practical and I like the look as well. We find ourselves grabbing it for a myriad of chores. A great addition to my larger granite ware pans.
2,Beautiful bowl with a terrible unpotected package,"This bowl was what I was expecting, except for some damaged in the borders.Terrible package for this kind of product; not even bubble wrap. I asked for a new bowl and I got a damaged one!I am really upset."
3,`Texans NFL cap,"Prime quality Item and I have no complains about it. But the box for the shipping has 280 Grams of weight and the cap just have 110 Grams, this increase the cost of shipping for me in 30 USD. In my opinion this is a very good improvement opportunity for the seller,Thanks,"
4,clever purchase,"It is not a fancy knife that you may dream of, but it is a very nice knife the needs honing from time to time. I have a collection of knifes some of them are much more expensive and I find myself using this knife very often. Highly recommended."
2,beautiful until it rusts!,I bought the whole set of these knives since my new kitchen now has a knife magnet so i figured i'm going to get some gorgeous knives! well it think it's best they just sit there and not get used since when you wash them they rust like crazy. pretty disappointed but luckily they weren't expensive..i guess you get what you pay for. made in china so what did i expect?
2,Buy insteed the GOB BLUFF DVD,This has just 30 min. of VDGG that you can find as well on the GOD BLUFF DVD as well. So just buy that one and you'll have both!!
1,Very Dark Pictures,"Overall it seems like this printer would be great, however, there is a big big issue here. The pictures that are printed are very dark. This makes people's faces almost impossible to see. I'm using iPhoto to print my pictures instead of printing directly from the camera/memory card itself so mabye that is the issue.I've seen this complaint on numerous message boards (including this one) and I didn't really believe it, but now that I own the printer I can tell you that it is a real problem. There has not been a ""fix"" released by Canon for this problem yet and I get the feeling there never will be from what their customer support has been telling me.Buyer Beware."
4,Good compact printer,"I've bought this printer and my family is happy with it. You can print your pictures anywhere with high quality, and you can send your picture as post card easily. No worry about ink."
2,"I'd love it, but.....","I really wanted to give Canon 5 stars on this one. The footprint is small, the idea so superb, but the printer doesn't reproduce the pictures I print faithfully.Canon support has been excellent, but, they replaced my ES1 that was printing dark pictures with an all new one, and the results were the same. So, until I can get a true representation of the pictures that I am trying to print, this printer gets a 3 star.The print quality is amazing, but the darkness of the prints makes the features on a person's face undetectable, ruining all family pics. There is no option to make adjustments on the printer, so unless you want to edit all your pictures (that really don't need editing) you are stuck with darker than real shots."
3,Where to find the ink cartridge refills ????,"Overall, pretty nice looking photos. I am impressed. The paper is not sticky after it prints as is the case with the HP printer that I have. My only gripe, is that I cannot find the cartridge refills anywhere. Are they being phased out, discontinued? Maybe because of the Holidays they are in short supply. Many online places have them as sold out. Forget about getting them around town,no one has them. I would rate this a 4 star, I really like the ease of use, but really do not like the fact that I need to look and look around for the cartridges."
4,Great photos with some tweaking,"We got this about 2 weeks ago; the quality is superior to our last inkjet photo printer, and it's ease of use and small footprint are major pluses. The photos came out a bit dark, but it's all adjustable with the included drivers. Price is about $.26/print, a bit on the high end. It's easy enough for anyone to use, and has lots of options for inputs. Another well-built product from Canon."
5,I am only through Chapter 1 -- mind blowing!,I received this book as a gift on 9/9/99 and it took me until this time to get into it. I am an avid Memetics fiend and host memes.org and now I am realising that this is only part of the equasion: its also about corcion techniques and NLP -- and this book makes it so approachable and isn't too paranoid or rabble-rousing -- its an intelligent thoughtful look inside the minds of the corporate golems.
5,Great bathroom read!,"I thought this book was easy, entertaining and scintillating. It's also highly relevant in this uncertain time, e.g. www.disinfo.com's article on how TV acts as an opiate for the mind."
3,coercive tactics presenting coercive tactics,"i first read this book last year and it blew my mind. since then i have read alot of political authors including but not limited to noam chomsky, morris berman, howard zinn, al frankin, micheal moore etc. and i recently reread this book. i was rather dissapointed the second time.coercion is a rather elementary look at manipulation compared to other cultural and media analysts but it cant be denied that rushkoff presents the basic facts that millions still dont even recognize or even seem to care about their manipulation. His basic argument ""why we listen to what they say"" is a beuatiful yet huanting line which is relevant in our everday lives, and yet the majority of us dont even question it. it is imperative that we understand all different forms of maniplulation and or take action to subverse the medias teaching.i reccomend, if you would like to get more in depth, read any of the authors listed above."
2,what they said wasn't that interesting,"I found this book a bit dated. I also found the prose paranoid and dense. The overall effect wasn't compelling, much less coercive."
2,Beware--It's all a conspiracy,"While this book contains some interesting factoids on consumer behavior and a cool write-up of CIA coercive tactics, I found the book unsatisfying for three key reasons. 1) He seems to equate all targeted marketing with some grand conspiracy -- c'mon. 2) Consumers are made out to be silly puddy without the ability to make reasoned, rational choices on their own. 3) Towards the last half of the book the author laments that his hope for the Internet to be a great savior from all this coercion is not coming to pass. Give me a break--who thought the Internet was devoid of commercial influences? The book wasn't solely without good points. The amount of information on individual consumers that is freely traded by corporations (especially credit card companies) is indeed troubling. And I do have to admit that I purchased this book after it was featured on the Amazon homepage..."
2,This book is highly overrated.,"This book claims to talk about how we are coerced by large corporations, public relations firms, governments, etc. It is too bad that by the last chapter it degenerates into a rant against consumerism. Most of the second half of the book is a long ego trip that is entertaining only because it is so over-the-top."
3,mediocre and annoying,"This is a very mediocre book, and somewhat annoying to read. It is annoying because Rushkoff attempts to coerce the reader into accepting his subjective views with a breathless, repetitive use of the same adjectives and opinions throughout. It is mediocre because it is short on substantive research - either psychological or market research; possibly, a lot of the good market research is proprietary. Its strong points are Rushkoff's anecdotes, and some good summaries of what is going on in marketing, including advertising, sales environment, and salesmanship. Incidentally, I am fairly liberal, so it is not my ideology speaking."
3,"Yugen Fardan Rashad, journalist, purveyor of Black culture, jazz radio announcer","Herbie H is a mad scientist always looking to blend diparate parts to create an music alchemy that moves a new directions in sound. George Duke in an interview when asked of Herbie's adventures in 'singing' through a vocoder, alluded to the words 'jivin"" and is he serious?His courage to push the limits is admirable even while not always up to his enormous genious.That's HerbieYugen Fardan Rashad aka Gene the Jazz Machine, Jazz Rap II KBOO 90.7 FM"
2,uhhhhhhhhhh...........,"Probably the weakest of his 70's efforts. The album focuses too much on the vocoder, which Herbie sounds redundant throghout. Theonly person who can pull that off is Roger Troutman. He had a unique way of using it, where Herbie was just keeping up with the times. Only worth getting for ""ready or not"", obviously influenced by Ray Parker Jr. Other than that, its a failed attempt. His next album ""Monsters"" was much better, particarly for the two ballads, ""stars in your eyes"", and ""Makin'love"""
1,It is not as good as claimed,"This only works on a very limited number of printers. They do not cover most current popular models, in fact very few. You can ask for new profiles but they don't warrant anything. If you do not buy directly from them they will not stand behind their equipment. The scanner supplied is very cheap and prone to failure. Their technical support staff are not helpful and they top it off by being rude."
3,The Mum Minder,"The Mum MinderBy Jacqueline WilsonThis story is about the week in the life of an eight-year old girl called Sadie whose mother is a child minder. Sadie&#65533;s mother looks after three year old Gemma, two year old Vincent, baby Clive and Sadie&#65533;s sister Sara. During the week of the school holidays, Sadie&#65533;s mother gets the flu. This book tells the story of how Sadie helped all the other mums to look after the children in turn by taking them to their workplaces. By the end of the week Sadie&#65533;s mother feels better but Sadie and Sara catch the flu!This book is light hearted and has got quite a few laughs in it.My favourite part is when all the little children pinch the chocolates from Clive&#65533;s mums shop. I think it is a good book and I would recommend it to a friend of similar age.I would rate this book 3/5.Rachel &#65533; From Merseyside"
1,poor,very unsophisticated description of the process. looks more like a list for the naive entrepreneur than a real book to prepare to being introduced to investors.
5,Miracle Of Adoption,"Kari's story is a testament to the miracle of adoption. So many things have to happen in order to find that special child. And when it finally happens, through good and bad, adoption leaves you with no doubt that there is a God, and that he has a plan for you. After reading this book, I was reminded of the blessings of my own two adopted sons and our journey to find them. My heart was with Kari all the way, ever mindful of the yearning and feelings of desperation in the quest for a baby. I encourage all adopting parents to read One Tiny Hope: A Journal To My Adopted Child, and learn from it."
5,I hope everyone will take the time to read One Tiny Hope.,"I really enjoyed this book. Being an adopted child myself, I was very touched by the love that Kari showed while seeking for her child. This book is inspirational to both adoptive parents and adopted children."
4,"Faith, Courage, Focus and Hope","This well-packaged, straight forwardly told and ultimately poignant journal of Kari Gilliam Palmer's determined effort to adopt a child movingly captures the twists and turns involved and makes clear the toll the process can take on the prospective mother and those around her. We never lose sight of the authors supportive family- We keep track of them through diary entries as well as letters they send to Kari to help maintain her spirit and perspective. In large part, active ingredients in the author's ultimate success come down to faith, courage, focus and hope, and the happy ending will provide comfort and encouragement to others in a similar situation."
3,For adults only,"My husband and I watched this show when it was on NBC years ago and found it very funny. So when I found it on Amazon, I thought it would be great to watch it with our children, who are fans of CGI animation and movies like Toy Story and Monsters Inc. Unfortunately I had forgotten that the show was meant for adults. We watched the first and 2nd episodes before we realized we couldn't keep up with hitting the mute button to silence the foul language. The use of the bad language is completely unnecessary...the Lion father-in-law uses ""bastard"" way too many times for me to count. It's a shame because this could be fun for the whole family, if the language could be cleaned up a bit."
5,Thank you Siegfried and Roy!,"Wonderful to watch a program that I can truly enjoy! Very,very funny...touches on many subjects with humor! We need more programs like this on television!"
4,Funny,"At the cost of $1mil per episode, I suppose the series was an expensive exercise. I thought every episode was very funny, well executed and thoroughly entertaining. What a pity we wont be able to visit this crazy family again in the future. Once or twice a joke came across as forced, or somewhat crude in comparison to the general tone of the series, but these are minor problems. Well worth watching more than once."
2,"Great show, poor presentation","We love this show, but the price was way too high for only a 14 episode season with no special features. There wasn't even a booklet inside the case with trivia or episode guides or anything. For only $4 more, we got two full seasons of ""Titus"" (which is equally as funny) with plenty of special features. The show is hilarious, but the poor presentation makes this a not-so-hot buy."
5,Father of the Pride; one of the greatest sitcoms ever!,"Father of the pride is definately one of the greatest sitcoms invented. The show is set around the family of Segfried and Roy's lead lion. We see him (Larry) put into many situations we could only see in a sitcom. It shows much of the humor that make Dreamworks shows and films so popular, however often with more adult overtones. To quote Larry, ""Big Daddy's home and ready for lovin'. It might be 9 O'clock in New York, but here, it's mountin' time!""The animation has to be some of the best ever to this day, and the writing is definately reccomended to anyone who wants a show with subtle satirical criticisms of society. A must have for anyone who loves sitcoms."
5,father of the pride,maybe you just have to love seigfried and roy or maybe you have to be an animation lover but whatever i'm both and i dearly love animals also and i thought this was one of the greatest animations ive seen in awhile also i'm 60 years old and a grandmother if that makes a difference. lljs. thanks to seigfried and roy for just being who they are.
4,"Great Show but why no ""play all""",I was excited to get this DVD set because I thought the series was incredibly funny. I was dissapointed when I opened the DVD to find that there is one disk with two sides and there is no PLAY ALL option. This was a major improvement in the Simpson DVD series. You would think by now they would have figured out that this feature is important to viewers!
4,Father of The Pride,Very Funny. Adult oriented family life comedy with nice animation. Worth watching.
5,Judge for yourselves,"This show is nothing like the first commercials would lead one to believe. I was expecting a smut filled trudge through the zoo but instead found it a delightful romp. The animation is first rate. The lions are a loving family and the animated Siegfried and Roy are just perfectly over the top. They were, in my opinion, the funniest part of the show. The humor is gentle and the ""smut"" is not constant nor is it of the ""in your face"" variety. It will very easily go over a lot of childrens heads.Personally I find it refreshing to be able to watch a show (animated or otherwise) that is not wall to wall violence and who's main aim is to just make everyone happy.I was pleased with the show and am looking forward to many, many more episodes!!!"
1,they LIED,"on the top of the case it says ""THE COMPLETE SERIES"" what it should say is the edited, censored, water downed version so we try not to offend anyone but white men cause they dont matter version. I wanted the complete series, not an edited series. what is it with these companies changing stuff to be politically correct?? the most obvious edit is they got rid of the cat cleaning off larrys whip cream. but they leave in the white men/lions cant dance joke. what else has been edited for my viewing safety?? this is why I wont buy the ""in living color "" series, they edited them. unfortunatly I pre ordered this but wouldnt have got it had I known I wasnt getting what they are advertising. the shows are funny but I hate when they do the PC thing so as not to offend anyone."
5,A hilarious show that doesn't get the respect it deserves,"While enticed by the fact that the show was totally CGI, after watching the pilot episode of FOTP I was leery on whether or not it could hold me after another epiosde. Thankfully I was proven that indeed it could! I actually found myself really enjoying each new episode that was released week after week. The comedy, while more adult in nature for the station, often had me rolling with laughter. Some of the lines are definitely quotable for a laugh among friends and fans. The guest voices that would appear were fun and fitting, as well as the random and strangeness of Seigfried and Roy. Father of the Pride probably wasn't as perfect as some other OH so wonderful Reality TV shows that're out there these days, but it's definitely worth checking out now that it'll be on DVD. The show deserved better than what some people were and are giving it. That much is certain."
2,Father of the Pride,"""The Complete Series"" was excellent, that is, if I could have watched all the episodes in their entirety without the dvd stopping now and then with scrambled images."
5,Best Cartoon Ever,"This series is HILarious. A total adult driven cartoon. Every episode is so cleaver and funny. Wish there was more than one season. Make sure you buy this series NEW. My first purchase was a used copy and even though I bought it at ""like new"" condition, I couldnt view the entire 1st side of the disc and the second side was so scratched I couldnt watch a full episode. I returned it and bought the new one, which hasnt given me any problems."
3,Having trouble making round hole,Working in Alum. Countersinks not coming out round. At low RPM get 6 sided pattern. I think this is called chattering. Also tried higher speed but same problem.
4,Decent,"A decent countersink, well worth the money. Too bad you can't find such items at Loew's or Home Depot these days."
5,Good Quality,"Good, solid construction. Sharp and finely cut. This is a solid countersink that was manufactured well. I'd use this for any personal or commercial construction."
4,"1/2 Counter sink bit works well, stays sharp","Length:: 0:40 MinsWe have used this bit to drill several hundred countersinks in acrylic and wood. Reasonable bit for the price. The video shows a 360 of the bit made with arqball that gives you an impression of the quality of the steel. You can see some pitting on the shank; nonetheless, this pitting and aesthetic blemishing does not affect the performance."
5,A HISTORY LESSON IN ITSELF,"you know what i hate? i hate that these young folk today do not have any respect for da TRUE SCHOOL. i remember watching that MAKING THE BAND when DA BAND was on there (what a friggin' joke!!!!!) and diddy told them to do RAPPER'S DELIGHT and none of them knew it. i thought that all of them should've been sent home right there.young or old, get this!!!! no, it does not tell the whole story, but it will up you on where a lot of these ""new artists"" are getting their ideas from. any young cats that are reading this, respect da TRUE SCHOOL!!!! i thank you."
2,It's a rappers delight!!!,This album goes way back to the beginning of rapmusic. Back to the days of broken glas everywhere and casanovo fly. You can't have better than this. The godfathers of rap are in the house.
1,The Incredible Petrified World,"I was excited about this movie because it centered around a Diving Bell. The Diving Bell in question is an OK design, but curiously is larger on the inside than on the outside! The plot of a lost diving bell and its survivors wandering around in a submarine series of air-pocketed caves could have been a true adventure. Unfortunately, the budget did not allow for any quality special effects or action. The divers exit and enter the bell without an airlock, yet the bell remains water free! Phyliss Coates is the crabbiest female character since Baby Jane Hudson! The male adventurers from the bell have some interesting dialogue, but Carradine has an impotent part and seems to realize it! (He's the designer of the faulty diving bell). There are endless scenes of the lost crew wandering through caverns (filmed in a real cave at least) and the hermit they encounter is one-dimensional. Image quality and sound are poor (the music is out of tune)."
1,fuggitaboutit.,"This is a very bad movie. With the exception of a wooden Carradine, the acting is perfectly awful. An explorer inventor creates a diving bell that gets lost. All survive and find an underwater cave, where there is an old man living mysteriously. If that is not preposterous enough, there is a volcano that becomes active, the characters find love and friendship, and then they are rescued. Sorry for playing the spoiler, but that is all you need to know.Not recommended. I did laugh a bit at the stupidity of it and the clunkiness, but it was best on while I was cleaning the house."
2,petrified action,"in the first five minutes you watch the deep ocean, strange creatures and a dramatic voice talking about the life in the sea, you expect a movie about some sea monsters but this is only a very slow motion film about an expedition of four persons under water and nothing happens...no monsters, no mystery, no nothing. Just a cave where they were trapped in, and a strange guy with a fake beard and no suspense at all. The two guys should show some worry about the situation but it looks like they are in a picnic inside a touristic cave."
5,Down to earth,"This book came for me at exactly the right time. I was feeling like a failure because we weren't highly systematic in our homeschooling. But I'm not of the unschooling persuasion. Waring did a wonderful job of just sharing her personal experiences. No pressure to try one method or another, no forceful political undertone. Just a friendly human being setting out to encourage other's to tailor their home school to their families needs, lifestyle and interest."
5,Great Book! Buy it you will be glad you did.,"This was just what I was looking for. It is full of great idea's and references to find more. I am a new home schooling mom who was looking for a ""ideal"" way of creating a home school for our children. Diana has given me a great example in this book. I aso came away with the realization that what our home school is today can (and hopefully will) change. If you are new to home schooling or an old pro this book will encourage and excite you. It is well worth the reading."
5,Beyond Survival: A guide to Abundant-Life Homeschooling,"Well done Diana! The only time I was inspired enough to write a ""review"" before was about a friends book,( out of shear pride). I don't know you, but I wish I did.I am buying two more books today. Two books for two VERY different women. Obviously, I believe that though these women are truly opposite personalities, they will both benefit ( and be comforted) by your words and ideas. I only wish that I had read this sooner: to quote my thirteen year old son "" It has been ten LONG years Mama"". They might have been more inspired years had I been blessed to find your book when we began. We have three more sons that will thank you some day.....and our thirteen year old thanks you now.You have helped breath some new life into our little schoolroom; I intend to reread your book should we start to suffocate again."
2,Disappointing,"I was really looking forward to reading this book, especially after having read the glowing reviews from other readers.However, I was very disappointed when I found very little in this book that hasn't been covered (and more in-depth) in other homeschooling books.This could have been an interesting read if it had had more substance. Its ideas just seemed a little vague to me."
4,"Good for inspiring a vision for homeschooling, a bit shallow on how-tos and details","This book does a wonderful job of inspiring a vision for what homeschooling can be like: personalized, relational, part of real life instead of school at home, etc. The author really excels at making the reader feel free to make homeschooling, curriculum, etc fit her family. There's not a ton of detailed practical how-to information on testing, planning, scheduling, adapting course materials, etc. But, in terms of giving a vision to strive toward, this book is great."
2,not as it says...,"The item description says that it has a telescopic antenna, noplace on this item is there an antenna...It seems to work ok, but in an emergency situation with a small internal antenna, im not sure that it will pick up any transmissions in an ""out of the area"" type of scenario..."
1,You Dont Even Get What You Pay For,This product should not even be made. Even the box this thing was packaged in seemed poorly built. The knobs and housing had a real Ken and Barbie pretend playhouse feel. It functioned for exactly 1 day before it broke. The crank worked just fine- it just stopped working. I would rather pay $50-$80 for something that I knew I could rely on for years to come. Instead I spent $20 and bought a broken piece of crap. Beware!
2,Radio buttons broke the first day of use...radio will not turn back on...,"the radio button caved in or something, they offered to exchange it but I never sent it back... I turned it on and played with it for 5 minutes and broke the radio on off button...lol.. I dont know why it broke so easy... the flash light still works when u turn it, its pretty bright and useful but I gave it to my 4 year old to play with and it still works... just be careful with the radio buttons..."
4,Just Right,You just can't beat this for the price. Plenty bright for a dark room. Just crank and light. We bought 4 to keep all over the house!
2,"Used this in ""The Great San Diego Blackout"", Sept 8th 2011","This thing is a pain in the ass. A minute of cranking only seemed to provide 10 minutes of radio. After a couple hours of this I was looking for ways to jury-rig it with my power drill to do the cranking for me. All I wanted was to be able to shove a couple batteries in it.Needless to say I'm going to try to find an emergency radio that accepts AA batteries, since I always have a large stockpile thanks to Costco."
2,after 2 years of occasional use...,"... accumulator stopped holding a charge. How is this supposed to be an item that is good for emergencies, that is used once a year or so. Disappointing."
2,You get what you pay for,"This is the cheapest crank radio/flashlight that I could find, and there's a reason for it.The LED light works fine. It's not very bright, but it'll keep you from bumping into walls.I wheeled through all of the AM and FM channels and couldn't get any signal, just static.It has a hole with a pin in it that's supposedly you can put a cable in to charge things like cell phones via the dynamo crank. The one square of paper documentation gives no details about what sort of cable you would need.In my opinion, this is the cheap thing you buy before you realize that you really should have just spent a bit more on a better quality item. It'll sit in your kitchen drawer and you'll use it on occasion, mostly for the novelty of cranking your own power, before sticking it back in the drawer for another few years until you rediscover it again."
5,Great for the price!!,"I ordered 3 different Dynamo crank light/radios. This is the most compact, but also my favorite. The stations are easy to tune. The light is bright, and has two settings. The crank was easy, and it didn't take long to get light and sound. Also, the siren is LOUD!! Louder than many bigger versions, not sure what I'd use the siren for, but it works great. I will order more, and definitely for Christmas gifts.My older crank radio/flashlight was broken when Hurricane Irene hit, I don't want to be without one again. Go for it!!"
1,Cool while it worked...for a week,"This thing FELT sturdier than a lot of similar items, and the LED was bright. Radio worked well.The crank stopped functioning in about a week after receiving it, first jamming completely,now it will turn freely without engaging (so no charging anymore). This was a christmas gift that was ordered a few days before november, so by the time I found out it was junk amazon's window for returning it had passed. Still waiting to hear back from the manufacturer. Save your money, this thing is too unreliable."
2,Poor quality,"I purchased this item for my 16 year old nephew for Christmas 2010. He has had it less than 5 months and has used it approximately 5 times and the crank has fallen off. Amazon will not refund or exchange the item. Based on Amazon's suggestion, we are going to contact the manufacturer to see if this part is covered under a warranty. Very disappointed in this product."
3,Adequate,"I bought this hoping I'll never need it. I tried it out when it arrived to make sure it worked, and it did. The quality feels like something you'd get for free with a company logo on it for stopping by that company's booth at a conference or trade show. For the price I guess that's OK."
2,Dissapointed in the USB Charger,"I purchased this item for the USB charging unit, and it doesnt work. I have the correct connections for my iPhone and when you hook it up it does absolutely nothing. I bought three units and none of them will charge my phone. The light is mediocre, and so is the AM/FM radio is as well. Im going to be looking for another item that will deliver as advertised."
3,Disappointed in Brightness; Radio Works Well,"I was expecting more brightness from this flashlight, considering it has 5 lights as opposed to others with only 3. To my surprise, this flashlight is not nearly as bright as the cheap 3 light wind-up flashlight I bought my toddler. I have also been disappointed in how quickly it loses its brightness/requires more winding up. That being said, it is a decent flashlight and feels sturdy/well made. The radio works extremely well, which is one of the main reasons for me buying it (for use in an emergency kit). Not a bad deal for the money, but I don't know if I'd buy again."
1,Radio Doesn't Work,"I purchased two of these based on the reviews. While the flashlight and siren work, after one use, the radios do not. On one flashlight, the battery does not hold a charge to run the radio (again, this after only 1 use) and on the other, the radio stopped working completely (after only 5 minutes of use). If you want a flashlight, this is fine; however, if you are looking for the whole package, I'd recommend looking elsewhere."
2,Kinda crummy,"Flashlight's OK but the radio sucks. Can't get any FM station in clearly and there is one right here in our small town. It's a lot smaller than I expected, too. On the box it states ""high quality am/fm radio"" but it's one of the worst radios I've ever listened to. Almost worth it just to read the Japlish on the box though."
5,"bright flashlight, clear radio all in a convienent package","great flashlight/radio/siren combo, easy to crank, bright and has good sound. can convienently stand up on its own, fits into you hand, pocket or bag comfortably. will likely be getting plenty more of them for gifts. it's the best of its kind i found on the market and have been entirely pleased with it thus far. the radio functions well with hardly any cranking the flashlight needs just a bit more and is brighter than another model i'd been given."
4,Excellent Gadget,I received one from work for being a safety warden. I have used it many times instead of a trouble light for maintenance around the home.The speakers are pretty good for a small radio too.I eventually bought 7 more for every member of the family to keep in their cars.
4,Great Item,"I purchased 4 emergency flashlights for holiday gifts, and they arrived quickly, as promised. The flashlights are really great for the price. They function well, and have a contemporary-looking design. I did not like the packaging, as it looks really cheap, and there are several misspellings on the box. For personal use it's great and I highly recommend it...for a gift you might want to take it out of the box and repackage."
1,Awesome flashlight,"Update: I lied. This thing was great at first, but less than 6 months later, NONE of the 4 flashlights I bought held any kind of charge. It still works, but I have to continuously crank if I want to use the flashlight or radio. When i stop cranking, then the flashlight also stop, VERY annoying, but i now just use it as a BACKUP just in case for some reason, I have ABSOLUTELY no flashlight with me, and I desperately need light, then i'll just crank it when i use it. Changed my review to 1 star.I just received this in the mail and just tried out all the features. Absolutely love it! Compared to the garrity 3 led crank flashlight, this thing is much brighter. I'm thinking of buying a couple more to give to people for xmas this year, it's just one of those things where you need to have in case of any emergency, will definitely come in handy!"
1,Great Idea but Terrible Implementation,"This is a mediocre product. The idea is great but the actual product is poor. The LED is very dim and blue. The cell phone charger is a good idea but without the right tips, not useful plus according to the instructions you may only have 5-10 minutes of charge. And only China would make a product for which you have to actually scout around to buy the electic adapter."
4,handy little gizmo,"It's lightweight, not particularly ruggedly built; the radio works, but isn't fantastic. But what do you expect for the price? I think I got my money's worth. The only thing I would suggest to improve the design, is if there was a compartment to accept a couple of AA cells, so that it could be used as either a ""winder-upper"", as it is now, or by operating a switch, could be used as a regular battery-operated flashlight."
1,WARNING: CHINESE JUNK!,"Do NOT rely on this for an emergency! I bought six of these for my family. The second time I used mine I gave the crank a couple of turns and the cheap tiny plastic gears immediately stripped. Now the flashlight is useless. JUNK! Don't waste your money on this one.If you must buy one, or already have one (as I still have five), then turn the crank VERY SLOWLY AND CAREFULLY to try to avoid stripping the gears. I think this will be impossible for my kids, but that's the deal.It's hard to imagine a more cheaply-made device."
1,Avoid this piece of plastic cr**,Broke within minutes of arriving...components are cheap and plasticky...would hate to rely on this in an actual emergency.
3,smaller than expected good workout for your arm.,Flashlight works well so long as you crank it really fast for two minutes which will leave your average person with a very tired arm. I would not suggest the elderly purchase one of these unless they intend to plug it in to charge it which would then of course defeat the purpose. Tried to charge an mp3 player cranked till I could not crank no more something like 5 minutes it did show it went up a bar until I stopped then the mp3 dropped back down to one bar. I have not tried it on a cell phone yet. The radio I managed to tune in the strongest country station here in Florida nothing more on FM and nothing on AM.....the siren was an entertaining feature for my 11 year old son.
3,It's cheap,"With this product, you get what you pay for. It is cheap, which is why I bought it, but I do not expect any serious performance out of this. Some of the moving parts seem fragile, so I feel as if I need to take care while using it. It does function, which in an emergency situation, that is what I will be looking for. I like that it is light weight and small. Overall I would say it was an okay deal for the price."
4,great flashlight,This is a really hand and nice flashlight. With a couple winds the flashlight instantly turns on. It is super bright; you can go into a pitch black room and it will light most of the room up. The radio feature is also nice but I was more concerened who well the flashlight worked and so far so good. Great buy.
4,Okay...but not as bright as I had hoped,"This product is okay for an emergency, and it is convenient to not need batteries. The light could be brighter."
2,Boomtown Rats succumb to the Loudness War,"When reviewing an album of *great music*, it's troubling to have to talk about something as apparently trivial as AUDIO QUALITY and SOUND DYNAMICS. Most record labels no longer care about it, so why should the fans? The sad fact is that most albums are now being remastered to sound good only on FM radio and ipods. If you dare to listen on headphones (as a previous reviewer discovered) you'll be shocked at how bad it sounds. Even if you ignore the audible crackling, your ears will be so physically fatigued by the looming white noise that you'll struggle to listen through to the beginning of ""Mondays"".If you know what I'm talking about, I advise you to return these botched ""remastered"" CDs for a refund. If you don't, just Google ""loudness war"" and educate yourself to this mess. The major labels are ruining great albums like this and yet they wonder why their industry is dying?"
2,Way too digital,"Like many others, I have waited a long time for this to become available on CD again. It is one of my favorite albums. However upon listening with headphones (is there any other way?) the digital noise usually associated with low bitrate mp3s is everywhere. Particularly ""Mondays"", ""Keep It Up"", ""Nice & Neat"" and blatantly on ""Episode #3"". In comparing it to a CD copy of my own clean record, the sound of that, digitized though it may be, is much better than this release. Maybe we have become so digital that most of us no longer hear these imperfections, but as an avid present-day record listener, I recommend saving your money and putting it towards a quality turntable. Remaster? Possibly. High quality? Definitely not."
5,"an excellent bit of the ""new wave""","most people tend to write reviews because they really love a cd, or they really hate it. this is, by far the best rats cd/album. i am so happy it is finally available on cd. ""mondays"" of course, is the famous track, but its all good: life, love, paranoia: the rat's take on it is delivered with fine musicianship, great production, and bob geldof's sneer. i dont even care about the bonus tracks, they are o.k., the main album is wonderful and highly reccomended."
5,Very Fine,Truly a masterpiece. Been loving it for 30 yrs. I think U2 got their sound from the beginning of Sleep.
5,The Classic Rats from UK,Greaaaaaaaaattttt re-edition of a classic one of the New Wave. The delay finished there am this great disc and all the catalogue of Boowmtown Rats rescued here. For anger of the used and expensive salesmen of cd's.
5,Mary Did you Know is one of my favorite,so to be able to down load it right to my Kindle Fire was a plus.. play it every day!
3,Somewhat Likeable CD,"I am a big fan of Mark Lowry and was looking forward to listening to his songs. The song that prompted me to purchase this CD was a number he personally wrote...""MARY, DID YOU KNOW?"". I was dissapointed with his performance of it on this disk. Overall it would probably be a nice introduction to gospel music for a child. Not his best work."
2,Contents list,"Here is list of the contents of this set:Disc 1: Prisoners of the Lost Universe (1984); Warriors of the Wasteland (1982); Cosmos: War of the Planets (1977)Disc 2: Devil Girl from Mars (1954); Menace from Outer Space (Rocky Jones, 1950); War of the Robots (1978)Disc 3: Star Odyssey (1978); Crash of the Moons (Rocky Jones, 1950); Evil Brain from Outer Space (1956).Bonus Feature: Radio--""When the Worlds Met"""
3,Meh,"Terry Pratchett's ""Johnny and the Dead"" is the 2nd in his Johnny Maxwell series (Only You Can Save Mankind (Johnny Maxwell Trilogy),Johnny and the Dead (Johnny Maxwell Trilogy),Johnny and the Bomb (The Johnny Maxwell Trilogy)). The anti-war and social-injustice preachiness that marred ""Only You Can Save Mankind"" is gone, but the story is not as good. I'm nowhere near the target audience for this book, so I wasn't very happy with it. But, I'll guess that for the Pre-Teen or Young Adult crowd, it might be OK. So, that's what I'm rating it at: an OK 3 stars out of 5."
4,Johnny not so dead,"In a total change from the ""Disc World"" Pratchertt has an enthralling book. As much for the ""young reader"" as it is the adult. A lot of hidden humor that only an adult would enjoy."
4,great Halloween fun,"This second book in the Johnny Maxwell series hits the Halloween sweet spot. Terry Pratchett is a comedy master, and Johnny and the Dead has some really funny parts. The writing has tightened up a bit from Only You Can Save Mankind. The plot is smoother and the laughs louder. Luckily, Johnny and the Dead can stand on its own.Johnny and his friends are the best part of these books. They're well developed and play off of one another with expert timing. I was disappointed the female friend from the first book isn't around, but Wobbler, Yo-less and BigMac hold their own. Published in 1993, a few of the references have become dated, but in all the book holds up surprisingly well.Reading: Richard Mitchley is an amazing reader. His enjoyment just bursts out, and he does great sound effects, especially static. My Britishism dictionary was added to with the pronunciation of the word ""mall."" It rimes with ""pal.""Final Thoughts: A fun ghost story for younger readers."
5,And It Begins...,This is the soundtrack that started this fantastic franchise. The incomparable Jerry Goldsmith on this one. Nothing less than perfect. Make sure this one is in your Star Trek collection.
3,Would have loved to have been there,"I purchased the DVD and watched it last night. I have the shows from past years and this one does not have the pop that the others do. The artist lineup had the potential to really wow the concert goer but IMO was a little lackluster. My biggest disappointment was the video editing which is probably the main reason this rated a 3. Too many out of focus shots coming into focus, shots of the audience clapping instead of focusing on the artist, jumping to new shots so fast it really took away from the performance. I think the guy was trying to be too artsy-fartsy in the editing room and really messed up a good concert for those of us who were not actually there. If you buy this do yourself a favor and just pay attention to the audio and you will love the concert. If you do not have the previous years you are missing out on some first rate shows."
2,Dis a point ed,First two Crossroad DVDs were great. Great artists playing great songs. Just knew it was too good to be true or last. This 2010 issue was awful. Eric...how many times can you play the same song and have people buy it? Skip this one entirely. Wait.... Go buy a Joe Bonamassa DVD. You will be immensely better served!
3,high expectations,"Im sorry to have to say this Crossroads didnt hit the high mark that the others did . Too much repeat stuff from the others. Did have some very excellent performances though!!! Jeff Beck ... never disappoints ... Sonny Landreth awe inspiring.... others as well, but overall lacked the spark that the first two Crossroads had . Not enough of various players including John Mayer and very little of Joe Bonamasa...Bonnamaso???? Oh well, spelling is not my strong point. I look forward to the next one hope they include many of the overlooked performers!!!!"
2,don't waste your time on this one.,"was very disapointed seeing this concert in person and the dvd pretty much proves eric just can't thrill you like in the late 1970's and early 80's same thing over and over, time to retire mr.c or bring in some of the other great guitarist of the past. who still can string together some exciting great riffs. don't waste your time or money, blues or music fans just watch one of the other past crossroads concerts."
2,anticlimactic,"I was really hoping to see something that would top the last 2 GFs. But NoooooooJust about everyone of the returnees was disappointing and who was new came off tired and old.Replace Crow, ZZ Top, Lang, Mayer, Vaughn and Winwood with more Bonamassa, Kenny Wayne Shepherd, Satriani, Black Keys, Widespread Panic and Victor Wooten. I'm sure there are alot of musicians that coulda freshened up this dog.If there's another, I hope EC moves forward with the talent, not back."
5,"Jeff Beck plays, None shall sleep!!!","Many reviews here but, I will only review one track off this great DVD set.The genius of Jeff Beck is very clear on his version of Nessun dorma, an aria from Giacomo Puccini's opera Turandot. Of course Jeff has his Guitar sounds arranged pre-song but, from the first note to the last, Jeff steps on no pedals. Beck turns this classic aria into his own. His dynamic use of the fret board, tasteful spin of the volume knob & touch of the whammy-bar, are crying out the desperation of Calaf, (the original arias narrator.) Fellow musicians in the band help Jeff ride this superb music into pure electric bliss heaven! I feel that Jeff adds a unique nuance to this perfect music piece. I could swear that the spirit's of Luciano Pavarotti is somewhere in the solid body of his Strat & Puccini's is within Beck's fingers. An absolute fantastic work of music here folks. Worth the price of admission alone!!! A MUST PURCHASE DVD!"
2,What a let down!,"I had eager;ly anticipated the release of this DVD and ordered the import from the US. Whilst I really loved the first two concerts - this one was a major disappointment.Great songs though they are - why did they have to once again include Killing Floor and Six Strings Down? I question why Sheryl Crow, whom I greatly admire as a pop artist, is included in such a line-up. Jeff Beck is once again the 'stand out' performer along with EC himself, but there are too many other non-legend, lesser knowns to make this a great compilation. We seem to be getting more talk too in place of the music.It's time EC thought of inviting Joe Satriani to 'fire things up' or just get G3 to come and jam - that would really get the place jumping.I hope if EC does this again - he's more selective with artists and the producers of the DVDs are more discerning than the stuff they dished up on these DVDs.What a disappointment."
3,Crossroads review,"The 2nd DVD in the package won't always load in my DVD, and this is a problem exclusive to that DVD only. Non of my other DVD's (50 or so), ever have a problem when I load them. The music is GREAT, although I like the format of the previous CROSSROADS show better. To be fair, that format may not be possible with the larger turnout of musicians that are in this show. Steve Winwood was the only artist I was disappointed with, as the songs he did were also on the last CROSSROADS."
2,Try to stay awake while watching this,"As much as I love Clapton's music I have to say the best Crossroads was the Dallas one. I have DVD's of Dallas, the 2007 and 2010 Crossroads events and this one is the most disappointing one. I've never been so sick of seeing Bill Murray trying to be funny. After the 2007 Festival I would have thought they would have ditched him trying to MC the event, he was so poor. And Cheryl Crow? Gimme a break! Someone needs to rethink this and go back to Texas with the original format. Clapton, Beck, and ZZ Top rock but after that....."
4,Crossroads-Eric Clapton 2010,"Excellent album. I also have 2007 and 2004. All are excellent especially if you like amazing guitar playing.Didn't like all songs, but who does? Never liked all when i purchased albums either Overall, excellent concerts. Put out every 3 or so years. There are probably 50 outstanding guitar players in this genre. Country, like also, maybe 10 outstanding."
5,Superb,"Just a great cross section of outstanding guitar players. Noticed that there wasn't any hand shake, etc., between Eric and Bill Muray's favorite, Jeff Beck.Wonderful seeing BB sit in at the close."
4,Crossroads Rules,"I have both of the previous DVDs of the Crossroads festivals, 2004 and 2007, I have played guitar for almost 15 years, I have been in the music business in one way or another for over 40 years. These are some of the best live music videos I have ever seen, especially the 2007 one, the songs Jeff Beck does are worth the price of admission alone. His technique is unmatched. I have pre-ordered the 2010 DVD just to see Jeff Beck again, but I know there will be more jems inside waiting to be enjoyed. The guy who gave it a one star is probably a guitar snob, I've had to deal with them over the years, not everybody who's good gets famous and makes a lot of money, in fact almost nobody gets famous and makes a lot money, especially people who are only trying to do just that. So buy this DVD, enjoy it, buy a guitar, practice and have fun, there is nothing wrong with playing a 1,4,5 progression 'till the day you die! It's a blast!"
5,THE BEST FESTIVAL EVER,This gig was freaking awsome...all those great musicians...the sound quality....the image quality....LONG LIVE ROCK N ROLLIt worth every penny
3,So So,"I am a long time fan of the blues and of Eric Clapton but I thought the 2010 show was lacking in energy, unlike the previous two shows. Althought some of the acts were good I was not blown away as I was after seeing the 2007 show."
3,"More Joe, Less John!",Looking through this setlist there is one major mistake. Not enough Joe Bonamassa and too much John Mayer. I'm glad Eric has finally recognized one of the greatest rising stars in guitar playing today and invited Joe to perform at the latest Crossroads fest. Now he needs to share him with the rest of the world and not the publicity hungry Mayer.
5,Excellent Concert,This collection of stellar performances is just too good to miss out on. Every song is a gem. Love it.
5,A totally joyful experience.,"Too many wonderful artists, young and old, living the music and loving each other, to go through them all. Derek Trucks and Susan Tedeschi with Warren Haynes are worth price of admission alone, but EVERY PIECE is way cool."
5,great,I saw the festival on netflix and had to buy it. I love it! Getting it on blue-ray made the picture beautiful. I wasn't into blues that much until I bougt this blue-ray. I am in aw of the guitarists in it and am a huge fan now and have purchased several more cd's of various blues artists.
5,Great entertainment for houseguests!,"I received this blu-ray DVD set in the mail from Amazon the same day that two houseguests arrived for a 3 night visit. Every evening for the three nights we watched a third of the performances...great music, excellent videography, my guests were awed!They headed home to place an order for it too. Highly recommend. We kept a netbook handy and researched some of the performers on Wikipedia during the concert, that doubled our entertainment. Learn something new every day!"
1,Extreme Disappointment,Was given to me as a gift. Took a while before I finally got a chance to sit and watch it and the second disc did not work.
1,Damaged Product,"I received this DVD with a cracked case, DVD holder damaged such that the DVD's cannot be held firm anymore and one DVD with a crack in the center. I cannot easily return this item as I live outside the US. The packaging of Amazon appeared OK but this product must have been damaged at Seller's facility or earlier. I am not happy with this despite the wonderful content of the DVD's."
1,DEFECTIVE DISC 2 !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,Disc 2 wouldn't load at all. Got a relacement sent. Disc 2 on the new one wouldn't load either. Upgraded my firmware and all my other discs load so it ain't me or the blu ray player. DEFECTIVE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3,Same players and setlists from the last Crossroads Fest,"I was all set to pre-order, but looked at what I was getting. A re-mix of the last Crossroads fest! I know most people purchasing this are guitarists also and had heard the Buddy Guy, Jonny Lang & Ron Wood set was amazing, but everything else is keeping me from ordering since I already have the previous two."
1,Disappointment,Very few songs were performed that I recognized. Music was arcane and did not venture far from basic blues. The concert was a total disappointment. Could only be appreciated by die hard blues purists. In my humble opinion the buying the dvd was a waste of my money!
5,2010 crossroads festival,"Some of the best guitar players in the world together, really enjoying themselves and having fun in the sun, what's not to love?"
4,Nice collection,"The Crossroads CD is very good with interesting interviews and behind the scenes insight. Due to the extensive cast of characters, nobody gets to develop a sustainable groove, thus leaving the listener wanting more. I guess that's what all-star concerts are all about."
3,My own experience,"In looking at the other reviews, I felt I needed to base one on my own experience after having the DVD recorder/combo for over 3 months.I have had it freeze up and need to be unplugged twice, usually after I have left the unit turned on for 2-3 weeks without shutting it off.I will agree the VCR/DVD light is bright, but it is easy to tell which you are set to. The light for the clock is very dim when the set is turned off.As for performance, I'm enjoying the DVD burner. It works well, and I have very few issues. (See above). I would recommend reading the manual first though. While not entirely necessary its a good idea when you are trying to record movies that run just over 2 hours (due to the DVD media and picking the type of record XP, SP, LP, SLP).For playback, the movies I burn come in a little dark on my HDTV, while normal DVD's work fine. If I play the burned discs on a computer or other DVD/TV set they look fine.Overall I think the product is a good buy for a mid-range price."
1,Glad they don't make this anymore,"This thing is terrible. I don't know where to begin! Anything I burn (if it burns) doesn't play on anything else. The picture quality sucks. Any good features are non-existant. I actually got sunburned from the bright display. It was WAY overpriced. And to top it off, it crapped out on me 14 days after the warranty expired. Thanks Toshiba for a wonderful product."
4,Performs well,"Pros: This product met my shaving and hair trimming needs. The smaller T-blade trimmer does a really good of getting close to the skin and giving a clean shave, without leaving cuts.Cons: I wish there were more blades (for use in fading) for the larger trimmer but that has not impeded me much at all.Overall I would recommend it and I am satisfied with my purchase."
3,Clipper Review,"I have bought about 6 clippers, each priced at about $30 dollars. I mistaked these clippers for another version of Wahl Gold Ethnic clippers that have a really close cut. Regardless, I'll keep this short. If you cut your hair, invenst in some decent clippers Oyster Classics and Andis Masters seem to be the choice of alot of barbers. My next buy will not be a cheap cutting pair of clippers, if you care how you hair looks and just arn't cutting it all off, then buy some decent clippers and you tube how to cut hair."
3,"Nice Fader, trimmer is junk","I purchased this item for my wife. She specifically asked for the model of fader, and thought the bonus trimmer was a nice touch.Wrong! The trimmer is cheap, battery operated and could barely go thru my 1week of beard growth with fresh energizer hi-performance batteries.We own a barber shop and I know how important good tools are to the trade.If you need a fader, this is a great inexpensive tool( compared to Sally's or other supplier's price)The trimmer is a cheap gimmick, and I would reccomend a better stand-alone corded one.I did rate this item as a package, the fader would be 4 stars on its own."
4,Many Classics on this CD,"I am not a huge EW&F fan, but my fiance is. I bought this for her and watch her bop in the car while traveling. There are many great classics on this CD, enough to keep me interested. Let's Groove kicks, and September, and others. I still hear live bands play this music."
5,EWF - Still good after all these years,"It's a compilation, so you expect to hear all of the hits of one of the best groups of all time, and that's exactly what you hear on this CD. For those like me that never replaced the EWF albums with CDs, this is a must have because you get the best of the best on one CD. There are always a few songs that you wish had made the cut, but you will not regret owning this CD. The EWF concert in Vegas in Sept. proved yet again that this is one of the best bands to ever grace the stage. Thirty years later, they are still amazing."
5,Good intro for new EWF fans,This track has all the best EWF songs. Good for new fans and those who can't afford to buy all of EWF album's.
5,Cream of the Crop,"There are more extensive collections out there: the three disc ""The Eternal Dance"", the two disc ""The Essential Earth Wind & Fire"", but this single disc cuts right to the chase and delivers an entire CD's worth of the group's best and most beloved material.You can put this on at a party, let it play in its entirety, and not hear one complaint about any of the music, not only since EWF are one of the best groups ever, but they had so many hits that even someone who says they're not a fan is familiar with at least half of these tracks, and they upheld the quality along the way.An indispensable CD if EVER there was one."
4,"Earth, Wind and the Raging Fire!!!","CD is terrific. It's not just Earth, Wind and Fire, but like I captioned above, it is so hot, it's raging hot. GREAT!"
4,da bomb!,this album is so funky and cool i cannot stand it! It is one of my favorite CDs -- it makes you want to get down and dance!
5,Can't sit still,"Take it from an OLD baby-boomer...you can't sit still and listen to this CD! I call it my ""get up and clean the house while you dance"" music. Excellent!!!"
5,Of course 5 stars,"Of course I will give 5 stars to the best R&B band of all time. Being a fan of EWF, I wasn't disappointed with this CD at ALL. It includes all of the big hits.. ""Shining Star"", ""September"", ""Boogie Wonderland"".... all of them are HERE, so why get any other EWF compilation CD? This is a great start for anyone who wants to get into Earth, Wind and Fire or just good R&B in general."
4,"great album, from begining to end!","EWF's greatest hits is one of those rare albums you can't help but like. This is an album you can put on and leave on. So if you're looking for you're own soul soundtrack, look no further."
5,the best choice,"I have several Earth, Wind & Fire records and CDs, and this is definitely the best choice! I have the imported Dutch Collection, which has all of their hits, but this is still my favorite! It has so many great songs - this is their essential album.This CD is great for anyone who wants EW&F;'s greatest hits, and the price is good, too. If I had to choose one CD, this would be it.It could be better if they added Turn On the Beatbox, though..."
5,Enjoyable,"Nostalgic! I thoroughly enjoyed watching this video. It brought back vivid memories of being at a venue to watch E, W, & F - being mesmerized - and leaving the show feeling as if you were surrounded by some sort of aura ... It was great putting myself back there in the seats 30+ years ago ..."
5,Excellent!,This was a great buy and the songs are all excellent if you like this type of music! Just fun to listen to!
3,Just One Thing To Say...,"How can you purport a CD to be a collection of The Greatest Hits of Earth Wind & Fire and leave off ""Love's Holiday?"" Perhaps this would have been understandable in the days of vinyl, when 18 songs would have required a triple LP, but in the digital age, there is no excuse. 'Nuff said."
3,"Okay, but check out the older LPs/CDs..","I have always been more partial to the Charles Stepney era EWF--the earlier albums like ""The Last Days and Times"", ""Open Our Eyes"" and ""Head to the Sky"" with a bit of the rawness that EWF began to lose in their later years. This is an okay collection, it has all EWF singles, but from my standpoint, they were way funkier before they were radio friendly..."
3,"okay, that's all","This cd has about 3 songs that are real kickers-really good. The rest is not the best of E&F, like I would anticipate. I would not recommend this cd"
5,"Great cd for Earth,Wind,&Fire fans","If you are a big fan of E,W,&F like I am and you have nothing but those old scratched up albums by them;then this is a great opportunity to upgrade your collection. This cd is great for Earth,Wind,&Fire fans. It has all of the hits remastered and the sound quality is tremendous. This is especially a treat because E,W,&F always put a lot of emphasis on the enhancement of their sound. It is like hearing them live. This cd is a must buy for all their fans and those who aspire to really grasp the sound of Earth,Wind,and Fire."
5,Goodstuff,They used to make games with some depth to them. This games a classic immersive type where games just dont do that anymore. if you want pure direction and dont like any customization at all then play some ps2 or ps3 or xbox..Wolf
5,Creating the Icewind Dale All-Stars,"When comparing various titles of the same genre, you quickly see that Icewind Dale 1 & 2 are truly what games like Baldur's Gate and Planescape are supposed to be like. Not only are players able to construct an entire party of their own design, but the pause feature allows players to execute a variety of commands at their own pace. Not only does this keep play interesting, but it also allows for a much higher survivability of your characters, since you can plan your tactics at your own pace. A truly breath-taking, eye-opening experience."
2,Nowhere near the others,"As far role-playing concerned, this game is awful.The replay value is nil, because the plot is too centralized to the game, and you can only go to one place at a time. That would be vaguely annoying if not for the forced play: The areas are not an expansive wilderness packed with quests to complete and people to help. The wilderness is packed with monsters, usually exclaiming the same thing every time they die, until you get to the big lead bad guy who just says ""How did I fail?"" Then collapses. Then you go back to town and get congratulated for saving everybody once again, or return to fix some problem, and start over, doing the same, monotonous thing over and over again.The dungeon crawls are bearable, but overall, I wouldn't suggest buying this game. It's a better waste of time to just replay Baldur's Gate 2, Torment, or one of those.(Also, I couldn't find a single 2nd level spell scroll for my wizard after playing through the game twice. What's up with that?)"
3,Decent time-killer,"This game, like the others using this antiquated game-engine, is fun to play around with. What it lacks is a good storyline and character development. If you have played the Baldur's Gate series you will find this very familiar but quite a let-down after having the side quests and banter of your party-members. The areas are beautiful, but the sense of emersion is lacking."
4,I loved it,Old school ad&d with a deeper story than Iwd. I just finished the Icewind Dale trilogy book and had to pick this up. It is good and if you loved Baldur's Gate 2 this is up your alley !
5,Black Isle is the best for RPG games,"Neverwinter nights was a deception but this game is just exceeding all my expectations. This game is way better than neverwinter and is a reference for RPG gamers. The environments are very sharp and detailed. Things like fireplaces in homes are very well done and nicely animated, and the monster animatoins are very fluid and nice. Also, the magic effects are colorful and well-done.Graphics aside, the gameplay is great. The feats and skills are well done, and the ability to freely multiclass just like 3rd edition D&D; is great. I just can't say enough good stuff about this game. As a regular pencil and paper gamer, this is one of the best CRPGs I've ever played.It's worth your 50$"
1,for those with large screens...,the game may be great but it is unplayable on my 22 inch monitor. the graphics are stretched to the point where you can see individual pixels. I knew within five seconds of gameplay that I had wasted my money.
3,Not black isle's finest hour,"Although the staff at black isle usually knows how to create magnificent plots and entertaining gameplay, this game is a major disappointment.The main plot is ridiculous and the graphics disappointing. Though I must admit that some of the subplots are superbly crafted!It seems to me like they made a couple of really good quests and decided they were going to patch them together...It could have worked, but they failed.Yet... the game is playable on account of 3rd edition rules, super subplots and good voice acting.(Spoiler) Cambions feelings got hurt and they decide to wage war... come on!"
5,Great Game,"Just thought I'd share my my opinion.I think ID2 is a great game with a very deep lore, great graphics, replayability and more. If your into RPG games this is right up your alley."
3,Hmm good and bad,"The role is good. The character cration is fun. The graphics Suck!!! All the other playas say who cares about the graphics. But i still say it sucks up alot of fun out of da game. If the person who helped make it was reading it Id tell him the resason the grpahics were award winning was because the Baulders gate which first used them came out along time ago when grpahics sucked and thats when the got the award. the graphics are gettign outdated fast. But the game play is still fun. You jsut gotta try inoring the fact the graphics suck thou. I prefer Dungeon Siege, Everquest, World of warcraft, and Everquest II. So much more fun."
3,"an old standard, if you like retro","While I like this ype game, I found myself thinking I was on the wrong side. Premaking all fighters takes some of the fun out of building a team, such as in bauldars gate. I soon lost intrest."
1,Note to game designers: RPG stands for Role Playing Game!,"This game is just like Fallout Tactics: Brotherhood of Steel in that they both have absolutely no story and no real Role to Play. If you like mass combat with no reasoning or brain hurting dialogue (in other words you use the phrase GROG SMASH! more than twice a day) you will love this game. If you want storyline and such, might I direct you to Planescape Torment, Fallout, Fallout 2, or even (shrudder) Baldur's Gate 2 instead. You'll thank me later.I can't believe Black Isle made such a motarded game..."
3,Not as good as Torment and BG2,"I would have given this game 5 stars if the plot and the quests were as good as Torment and BG2. However, the implementation of the 3rd edition rules was a success. The game lets you choose and create all of your 6 party members. At first this might seem like a good feature, but the interaction between the party members is what makes an RPG a real RPG. The plot is weak and standard. If you want to be intellectually challenged, go and play planescape-Torment. If you like hack and slash type games like Diablo etc.. you'll definetely like this one."
3,both better and worse than the first one,The first game was all combat and offered a nice challenge with nice moody 2D graphics. I really enjoyed building up the team and not playing just one character. This time around far too many of the maps are just long non-descript paths where you must fight from one end of the map to the other. ONe location (the ice palace) you play thru twice and it was tedious the first time. The game-makers were looking to make the game longer the easy way and I felt I was being lead by the nose thru the entire game.
3,It works OK,The product works just fine. Make sure you put the screw to the correct position.I found the same model product is much cheaper at HomeDepot.
1,Soft Metal Means These Break After 1-2 Uses,"I was thrilled when these arrived in the mail. The price seemed unbeatable, and they fit securely to all of my standard bits. However, the metal in the hex screws is very soft, and after only 1 use the heads were completely stripped -- making these stop collars completely useless.I was using these in a fine woodworking application. But perhaps if you just wanted to use them as a guide for drilling into drywall, plaster, etc., then you could secure them less tightly to your bits (and thus, hopefully, delay stripping the cheap screws)."
2,Not real happy with these,"These do work, sort of....the allen key doesn't fit the allen screws....but they do what they are supposed to as long as you watch to make sure they haven't slipped. I don't think I would buy these again."
2,Does tighten perpendicular to the bit,"It goes on easy, but know matter how I tried I couldn't get it to tighten perpendiclur to the bit, which makes it of know use to me."
1,Poor,"General Tools S838 6 Piece 3/16-Inch to 1/2-Inch Drill Stop AssortmentDon't buy. The quality is poor, even at $7.99. Pay a little extra and get a set you might be able to use a second time."
1,More loony than loon,"""Loon Magic"" is an audio cassette promising ""an adventure in nature and music"". In reality, the music is extremely boring muzak. It's interspersed here and there with the spooky calls of the loon (diver), a bizarre bird distantly related to grebes. The voice of this primordial creature from the black lagoons does *not* go down well with elevator music, trust me! This cassette made me feel nervous in a weird kind of way, so I feel I have to listen to some chart pop to calm down...Only one star for this loony production."
4,Deceptive Refugees,"Humanity is delighted when it discovers an artifact heading towards Earth from Tau Ceti, especially since that star recently became a nova rather unexpectedly. They are thrilled when they realize that the artifact is a ship carrying refugees. Some are xenophobic but most are eager to get their hands on some first class alien technology. An expedition is dispatched to meet the ship and all goes well...almost too well.The aliens seem to know a lot about humanity. In fact, their knowledge seems uncanny and even frightening at times as they try to mimic their hosts. One person, though, learns the reason for this. They are not a simple group of refugees. They have much bigger plans and the survival of humanity depends upon treason and deception.This is a well written and crafted story for most of its extent. The end is a bit draggy but it is worth reading."
2,Not enough heat from the burner,"The instructions state that you should let the unit warm up for at least two minutes. Then, once it's hot, you are to slowly squeeze the insecticide pump trigger once every three or four seconds.The first several bursts of fog work pretty good but after that the fogger starts squirting out steaming liquid insecticide instead of fog. I find that I have to reduce the trigger squeezing rate to one slow squeeze every 15 seconds in order to maintain satisfactory fog quality.The slow rate of fog production is a problem for me as I have a large yard and the rate of fog production, being less than what the manual claims should be happening, is not satisfactory. For a small yard this unit might put out enough fog.I've tried two brand-new propane cylinders and have fiddled with the flame adjustment knob to no avail. I think if the unit had a slightly bigger burner or a larger propane orifice it would work much better."
1,Don't be fooled,"I have owned 4 of these foggers over the last few years. The first one worked great and lasted 3 years of near daily use. The second stopped functioning in 3 months. The third was dead in the box, bad ignitor. The 4th just quit today after less than 6 months use. Burner will not stay lit even with full propane bottle and a second changed out just to be sure. It lights and works for about 2 minutes. Then the fluid just pours out nozzel. Like most good products, the maker develops a good product, builds a rep for it, then starts to cheap it out riding out the rep until everyone knows it is junk. Where is the pride? Long gone in the USA. Do not buy this fogger, it is not what it used to be."
1,BlackList the Black Flag Propane Fogger,"Bought this product from Home Depot and it appeared to be working beautifully. But after refilling with BF insecticide, entire system broke down; plenty of heat-just ever diminishing fog until finally, no fog. As if plugged. Additionally, unit began leaking pesticide from bottom and became ""glued shut""- no ability to unscrew cap. This is no-good junk; maybe worth $10 since it becomes one-time use like the spray cans."
3,worked on black flies in canadian woods,"in early may in the ontario wilderness....the black flies are so bad many folks wear netting around their head. we fogged about an 80' x 40' area (around our cornhole game :) and it cleared out the flies for a solid 45 mins. that may not sound like much, but if you've been up there - that is a miracle. anything else including deet-filled applicant is useless. when they came back, we fogged again. the amount of fog does look like dry ice at a whitesnake concert. we were pretty impressed. if it worked on black flies - i imagine it does a number on mosquitoes."
2,Woorks very good if you can keep it lit,"The fogger works very well if you can keep it lit. The igniter is ok, but from the first use, it has been hard to keep the flame on no matter what setting I use (high or low). Doesn't seem to matter if there is a breeze or not and I have also tried different propane canisters. Typically the flame will only stay on for a few seconds before going out. Trying to get the fogger hot enough to produce a fog by lighting it over and over every few seconds doesn't work well (minimal fog)On the few occassions that I have gotten the flame to stay on long enough to heat up, it produces a great fog that clears my back yard of bugs, at least for a short time.All in all, I can'r recommend the item and will likely given an electric fogger a try nex."
2,Not too good!,"Bought one at Lowe's yesterday...have been using Burgess for years, finally wore out. This Black Flag is terrible. I will return it."
1,Would not light,"I followed the instructions to the T. The ""auto"" light did nothing.Could not get it to work with a flame light as well although I couldhear and smell the propane flowing. No good."
1,Waist of money,I have bought 3 of these. First one in Tenn. I loved it. 2 years later my second. 1st one was damaged in the move.2nd one only worked 2 times and quit pumping liquid. 3rd one same thing. At over $60 dollars a pop I want to used it more than twice. There are better ones available for the same money. Retired in Florida.
1,USELESS!,I have now used the Black Flag fogger five times and I don't believe it's killed a single insect. I followed the directions explicitly and ...NOTHING! The mosquitoes and gnats are just as bad as they ever were. It's actually worse than useless. Now I have all this poison on the grounds and hordes of insects. Don't waste your money on this piece of junk.
4,It works fine for me,"I purchased this at a local ACE on the recommendation of the clerk. When I got home I checked the reviews and got a bit worried. I decided to go ahead and give it a try anyway, figuring that I could take it back if it turned out to be as bad as the reviews indicate.I was pleasantly surprised, it works just fine. It produces lots of fog and it seems to control the bugs on our acre (really I just fogged about 1/3 acre in our back yard).My only concern is that the unit does have a pretty cheap feel to it and I've only had it for a few days so I can't say how well it will hold up."
2,Very Inconsistent.,My husband purchased this at Lowes and he really liked how it worked at first. It did the job of killing the mosquitoes as it said it would. The second time he used it there was a delay between the pushing of the ignition button and the time the mist would come out. It took several attempts for it to even ignite. The third time he used it the ignition push button would not even work at all and so it would not ignite. He read and followed all the instructions as he always does. We are now on Amazon looking for something better.
1,Junk,"Worked for 10 minutes. Then it went out and hubby was just blowing propane all over the yard! And it would not re ignite! Funny....this must be common, as the instruction guide has all these suggestions on how to light it without the ignition button! Really? Why not just fix the ignition design flaw Black Flag?Brought it back for a refund. Don't waste your money!"
2,It worked for a while...,"The unit worked good for a little while, but has recently stopped pumping. I'm also noticing a lot of heat on my hand to the point where it is almost unbearable to hold, which was not a problem when I first bought it.My next purchase will not be this same unit."
1,Piece of junk.,"I'm on my second fogger. The first one the pump quit during second use. The second lasted maybe three uses before the pump started leaking, by then was out of warranty. Overall it might be more effective to throw the unit itself at the mosquitoes. In fact that's what I did, got so frustrated with it, my hands tired from pumping, watched mosquitoes frollic in the fog laughing at me, threw the damned thing at the bugs and walked away."
2,I think that I read a different novel.,"I was a bit surprised to see that there were so many glowing reviews of this book. I felt as though I must have read a different novel, as I found very little to like about it.I found the plot tiring and tired-- a beat-down simple man swept away by a crazy damaged woman, and I found most of the plot elements (the abduction of the child, her emotional abuse) to be rather clumsy attempts at emotional manipulation rather than moving or hard-hitting. Dotty and Aubrey are some of the oldest characters in the world, and I found nothing particularly new in her treatment of them.I was pleased to discover that it was her first novel-- the writing itself is skilled and it gives me hope that her work has improved over time. Still, I'd skip this one."
5,An intriguing story,The author won a book award for Vanished and it was made into a movie !Taut and intriguing. Cannot imagine how she develops such interestingcomplex characters and their adventures. But they do show up on the TV newseventually.There certainly are these strange types running around complicatingour lives and Mrs. Morris gathers them together in her books.
2,Morris must have gotten better; she is still publishing.,"The low life characters of this novel bring the writer down to their level. I actively disliked reading this book almost from page one, until the last chapter. I find the perfect ending to a book is always hard. This is probably the only book I have ever read in which the ending was so much better than the entire rest of the book and offered redemption that will enable me to read another of Morris's works. While out of print, the book is still available in the library"
3,Not her best...,"I am a fan of Mary McGarry Morris, however, this book is not her best. Perhaps it's because it is so depressing -- all the characters are depressing and unmotivated. Swept up in the circumstances of their lives, they all seem victims unable to control anything. The only person I felt any compassion for is Canny, the child who is abducted. If you want to read a better book, read ""A Dangerous Woman"" by Morris."
1,Depressing book that taints the massachusetts life,"I did not like this book AT ALL. Full of profanity, sex, rapes, drugs and murders its not something I would ever read if it were not assigned. Though the plot was ok-it was ruined by the way it was told. Also, the ending was depressing and the story seems to taint the way Massachusetts families really are. I can easily say this is the worst book I've ever read.I'm a freshman in Highschool and this was summer reading...very BAD summer reading."
2,"Interesting at first, but ultimately boring.","Rober Bloch's ""Lori"" begins as a gripping story, but halfway though the book the author begins to draw the plot on too long. One gets the feeling he was stalling the conclusion, and it makes the work seem rather boring towards the end. And considering that there's only one truly frightening scene in this so-called ""horror"" fiction, it wasn't very satisfying. I expected more."
2,"In a word, disappointing...","Lori Holmes returns from college graduation to a destroyed life: her childhood home engulfed in flames, her parents dead in the blaze, a successful family business abruptly bankrupt. This is the beginning of Lori's nightmare; it will end with a death - but whose? From my point of view, who cares? I think I expected too much, knowing that this was a ""Robert Bloch"" novel. My mind wandered throughout, and I never could get into it. I've read many books in the genre that have held me spellbound, notable, in recent years by Mary Higgins Clark. I can't help but wonder what she would have done with this plot. Perhaps I'll read ""Lori"" again, in a few years, and see if my perceptions improve any; and perhaps I won't. (Too many books and too little time.)"
5,"Short, sweet, and jam packed with information","EVERY tip in this book--from what to have in the fridge to how to have sex and make your stomach look flat--was well-written and dead useful. Well worth the price, possibly even worth twice the price! Buy it immediately, and buy copies for all your girlfriends! Enjoy."
1,"Really lame, shallow advice you give to a dumb 16 year old.",This book was such a waste of my time/money. It gives you advice that is really commonsense. The book also offers you advice on how to date two men without either of them finding out. This was really stupid advice as no person with good morals would do this. Waste of time and 99% of the advice in here was commonsense. DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK! YOU CAN HAVE MINE!
5,Very helpful!,"I liked this book a lot. It was very helpful, though it did make a lot of refrences to sex. All in all, I don't regret buying it."
5,The best movie of the decade!,"L.A. Confidential, winner of 2 1997 Academy Awards, is a classic thriller that is completely unforgettable. The script includes characters who were portrayed by Kevin Spacey, Russell Crowe, Guy Pearce, James Cromwell, Kim Basinger, (in her oscar winning performance) and Danny Devito. They all live in Los Angeles and are involved in a conspiracy in which is a mystery of who killed who? Anyhow, there are several plots to the script involving cops, reporters, and even HOOKERS THAT LOOK LIKE MOVIE STARS (Kim Basinger) I give this Academy Award winning script a superb rating that should be recommended to numerous people across the country. It's an unforgettable suspense classic you don't want to miss!"
3,Generation Gap,"For those under the age of 50 or so, this film will seem sweetly romantic. It is certainly beautifully filmed and the cast is top-notch. But for those of us approachng the winter of life, it contains very disturbing and chilling images of the worst ravages that Alzheimer's disease can wreak on a loving family. Anger, fear, and helplessness in the face of mortality are more easily rationalized by the young (and especially young filmmakers?) than by the old, who may in all likelihood soon face them. This movie would benefit from an age restriction warning: something like ""Contains disturbing images and depictions of hopelessness and dementia. Not suitable for persons over the age of 60."""
2,Stupid twist,What starts out as a cute movie about an elderly couple falling in love ends with a stupid disturbing Hollywood twist that completely ruins the movie.
3,A Love Story About Dementia,"This is a very well acted and beautifully crafted film. Unfortunately, it is promoted as a tender romance between two lonely older people when it is actually the very sad story of an aging couple trying to somehow cope with the devastating impact of dementia. It is human, it is honest, and it is powerful; but it may not be a movie that you would choose for a romantic evening with your beloved. This is particularly true if both of you have reached the age when dementia becomes a serious concern. My wife of 45 years and I both found the ending to be deeply troubling."
5,Very Complete Kit,"These are the second set of pads for my 2006 Nissan Xterra. The Akebono kit is complete in that they include the stainless steel spring clips and the ""V"" springs. The ""V"" springs push the pads apart and off the rotors following brake use. The previous pads I bought from a different manufacture didn't include the extra hardware that's included with this kit. The pads were a perfect ""drop-in"" replacement. They came with generic instructions that state replacement of the spring and clip hardware is mandatory.Following the replacement of brake pads you should be ""gentle"" with the brakes for a several miles while the pads wear to match the rotor's wear pattern. Badly scored rotors ought to be removed and turned on a lathe at a local auto parts store to make them smooth."
5,The Control of Oil,"I read this book when it first came out. It is still on my bookshelf. It contains the amazing history of oil production in the Middle East. For decades the world price of oil was about $1.00 a barrel. US Oil Companies demanded more for US produced oil and price controls were introduced. For most of these decades the price of domestic oil was set several times higher. This was known as the ""drain America first"" policy. The ""drill baby drill"" movement is a continuation of this idea.Historically, Americans always paid far more for oil than the rest of the world.This book is a great historical treasure on an important subject."
2,I hated it!!!!,I should have realized by the cover that this book was going to suck. I mean what was the problem huh usually her books are good but this was so bad and I am mad I wasted my money on this dumb book. next time I will get the book from the library or wait until somebody else byes it and I can borrow theres
2,I was hoping for something quite as good as Revolutionary 1 & 2,"I am so disappointed w/ this album. Lyrics are boring, and so are the tunes and the delivery. It just sucks. I bought it without listening to it first. BIG MISTAKE. I thought, since Immortal Technique is so unique and in your face good, I could not go wrong. Well, I did and I wish I could get my money back..."
3,Shine baby shine,"The product says it's for all skin type but if you have oily skin like I do, you might want to look elsewhere. It feels light but it still made my skin greasy even though I don't put much on...."
5,"Wonderful Book, challenging web experience.","Carola Beresford's third edition of her wonderful book includes internet access through Evolve - I bought this book in June and immediately went on the website to investigate the resources. The experience was awkward and frustrating, my registration wasn't saved and the system made me go through the process over and over. I just checked before starting to write this review, and it's possible that it has been resolved. I was never able to find a satisfactory customer help site. In June I wrote to Carola, wondering if I was missing something, and she wrote back that she was frustrated also. As I said, it's possible now that the web issues have been resolved."
1,Worst of all. just like the movie. Why so Worst?,"The soundtrack has no emotional score at all, not so good for a love movie. Like the film, the music lost its place in taking the listener heart with low notes and un-effectiveness turn with the music."
5,It really is a party album,"Southside Johnny Lyon and the guys really ROCK! Another jersey shore talent, he's been around a long time but unfortunately never got the accolades and attention his pal Springsteen does. If you ever get the chance to see Southside Johnny & the Asbury Jukes in concert, you will be seriously entertained BIG TIME. This album is a fave of mine and is always included in any party collection I wind up putting together."
4,Great band,"I remember having a blast when I heard them play on campus when I was in college in the early 80s. This band is great but unfortunately is underrated. This CD has most of the band's hits, including the classic 'Havin' a party', 'Talk to me', 'Trapped again' and my favorite 'I don't want to go home'. If you don't own a CD from this band I would suggest buying ""The Best of Southside Johnny & the Asbury Jukes"" where you can get more bang for the buck."
5,Inspiration from the Master,Dave Draper is a man that can talk the talk and has walked the walk. I have had the pleasure to meet him and can assure you he is the real deal.The book is honest and inspirational. Dave's writing style is unique and designed to trigger action. I recommend this highly.
5,Weight Loss Straight Talk,"Dave's new book (Your Body Revival: Weight Loss Straight Talk) is excellent, I recommend it highly. Alot of good common sense and alot of motivation . Dave does not talk down to those of us who have a few extra pounds to lose before we see the rippling muscles begin to show more and more as we lose each unwanted pound. Dave gives alot of good common sense advice and makes it easy for even us beginners to understander. I read Dave's first book (Brother Iron Sister Steel) and loved it but could not wait for this book to come out is is for the beginner, it is for the over weight who want to take control of our weight and our bodies. Can't wait for Dave to write another book and I hope there will be a another book, for I know that it would be as equally as good as his two prior books. Thanks, Dave for all the advice and the much needed motivation that will help me on this weight lose journey and the path to better health and hopefully a beautiful body."
1,"Not fit 1-1/2"" pipe, nor the 1-5/8"" on the tool, ""plastic"" duty?","The website said it can cut up to 1-1/2"" pipe (and embroidered on the tool even 1- 5/8""), but it won't even fit easily just the 1-1/4"" pipe. Also hard to believe the cheap plastic body as ""Heavy Duty"" especially the accuracy and durability of the threads (I returned it right away so no exhausting tests on this anyway). It is the quality in the $1-3 comparible product range."
4,Good looking watch - bad owners manual,"I bought this watch because I liked the way it looked. The watch is very heavy, but I got used to that. The manual has not one word on how to shorten the clasp wrist band. If you buy one, look for the six band links that have small square holes on both ends. Use something sharp and pointed and push the steel rod out from the smaller square hole side. That link will then be removeable. Once I removed several links, the watch fit just fine. It should keep time just fine; the most expensive quartz movements are under $30 (I had an upscale jeweler tell me that)."
4,Very good product for a reasonable price ...,I just got this one for my son and he is VERY happy. Good value.
1,Looks nice but didn't work,"The watch arrived with a dead battery. Either look for another watch, or add the cost of a new battery and the cost of a real annoyance to your total cost."
1,Not worth the money,This is not a very good product. The sound quality is very poor. Very hard to get any stations come through clear. The CD player is very hard to operate as the CDs very often get stuck inside.
2,Probably won't last long,"My daughter received this item as a birthday gift a year ago. She used it very little. She was never happy with it because it's cumbersome and it takes up too much space in her very-limited dorm room. Her dad and I decided to buy it from her. We learned that the CD player has stopped working after only one year. Also, the sound quality is not optimal because the speakers hiss if the volume is not turned up loud. Since the CD player ceased functioning, I have a feeling other features will fail shortly. We are not pleased--and I would not recommend this item."
3,"Great idea, but a bit shaky","This is the only product I found which played an iPod, CD's and radio and was not horribly expensive. I read some lukewarm reviews of it but decided to try it anyway. I had to return it as defective. It would buzz when on iPod mode, especially if it was running on battery power, instead of electric. Then it began turning off by itself a few seconds after starting to play, regardless of the power source. I exchanged it for a new one which, so far, is performing fine."
1,Don't buy,I can't agree more with many of the other reviewers. The hiss on this player is unbelievable. Don't waste your money. We got this for my 8 year old and I thought it was just a flaw in the one we gave for Christmas. Exchanged it for another and it has the same low volume hiss. The manufacturer should just recall them.
1,Dissapointed,"I've had the unit for about 2 weeks, using it only for the radio. I heard the hissing in the background but blamed it on bad reception in my office building. Today I plugged in my Ipod and can't believe how bad the hissing noise is. I can't turn it up very loud and the noise overwhelms the song. I would like to return it, but alas I didn't keep the box. I would not buy this unit until they fix this issue."
2,Disappointed,"Wish I had read the other reviews first. I really wanted AM/FM ,ipod and CD on one unit. And this unit includes them all and it really looks good. But it does have the buzz coming from the speakers as others mentioned and it seems that the CD player on mine does not even work. The sound quality from my 10 year old Sony boom-box sounds better (using the ""Aux"" input going to the ipod). Too bad. Returning it in the morning."
1,"Muddy sound, annoying hiss","It's really too bad that this unit sounded awful. It's got the best bang for the buck for any iPod speaker system, as it offers AM/FM radio, a CD player, and a remote. (Why don't more manufacturers include those features?)But it fails on the most basic test for any boombox -- does it have decent sound quality? It most certainly does not. I don't expect audiophile quality, I just want it to sound reasonably good, and I've heard cheap tabletop CD players that sound better than this product.The hiss that all the other reviewers are talking about is present no matter what sound source you select, and while it's less noticeable when music is playing, it is always there. Music sounds muddy and has no clarity or sparkle whatsoever."
2,"Confusing controls, annoying hiss","That hiss everyone keeps talking about? I find it extremely annoying, and I'm no serious audiophile. In addition, I find the controls confusingly labeled and nonintuitive to use. This unit does have a lot of features for the price, and it works OK. But I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who cares even a little bit about sound quality."
2,The Hissing Sound Kills The Deal,"I just bought this and I can't believe the hissing sound that this unit makes. It only goes away when the volume is all the way off. It doesn't matter what mode you are in (iPod/CD/Tuner modes), it's always there. I planned on using it mainly in my bedroom while falling asleep but at a songs low sleeping volume, the hiss and song levels are about equal! If you push the volume higher the hiss isn't that noticeable but, in general, the sound quality isn't great. I may have lived with the sound quality at this price point but I just can't deal with this much hiss.I really wanted this to work as I liked all the features but with the hiss and lacking sound quality it's going back."
3,one missing feature,"For the money, the fetures can't be beat. I don't know any product that offers the ability to be portable, battery powered, play CDs (mp3 CDs too), FM radio, and all IPods and has a remote. It's a perfect beach/outdoor companion. While the build quality is very cheap and the sound quality is bested by my $30 Creative speakers, it does work and offers a simple all in one solution. It's not a replacement for a real stereo but it solves that outdoor tune solution for the current generation of music when everyone at the party has a different format.however the only missing feature that really sucks is that it doesn't charge the ipod when docked. so come prepaired and charged."
1,garbage,"Where do I begin? Ipod dock broke off, radio reception is horrable, aux dosen't work, brand new CD would not play, older CD's played, batteries installed will prevent time and preset stations from being erased...but as soon as you plug it into the wall (batteries still installed) it shorts out and you lose everything. DO not buy this or you be as happy as I am. : ("
3,A good buy... if you have an older model iPod...,"I have had this product for about three years now. It worked absolutely fine on my old iPod nano 1st Gen. But now, with my new iPod Touch, I can dock it, but when it is in the dock, I can only play music. If i want it to charge, I have to plug it in via USB to the iPod shuffle USB port on the bottom left. Here, I cannot play music. It is a terrible inconvenience to not be able to charge and play your iPod at the same time. Isn't that the point?Sound quality is pretty good. It's nice for at the pool, since it can get pretty loud. It's slightly bulky, but not too heavy. DO NOT purchase if you have a 2nd generation iPod touch. Other than that, it's nice."
4,Good Choice,"Product was great, definatly a lot of bang for the buck and it makes a great shop radio or something to take camping with you."
2,just poor audio quality,"it's amazing how they could charge this kind of money for the kind of sound it puts out. everything is fine about this unit from the fit and finish to the feature set. and even though the radio actually sound very decent, the ipod sounds like it's playing through a paper bag--actually, worse. it's that bad, sounds like it's playing without a tweeter. don't these people try their own products before they sell them? i hate it when they waste my time."
4,Great deal !,It works perfectly. The remote control doesn't have a very large range but it works. The volume is fine for indoors. In outdoors happens to distortion a little when you go loud (party style).
5,The best toy I had,"I am very happy and pleased with the performance, not to mention the price I paid for. I must admit I have very discriminating ear when it comes to music and sound reproduction. I need to be able to hear the right amount of treble and base to enjoy instumental music. This toy has it all.I carry it everywhere, picnic, camping, practice ballroom dancing with friends and work. It's the perfect partner for my IPOD. When at home, I have it on practically the whole day through, never cease to amaze me.My friends find it hard to believe the price I paid for the quality we enjoy. I wouldn't hesitate recommending this sound machine to someone.Daniel Loya"
2,What You Need To Know,"I don't want to bash this item, but anyone considering buying it should know that the sound quality is poor. I don't buy the ""it's great for the cost"" argument. It costs too much for what it delivers, and the remote is junk--you have to stand over the unit and point from three inches away--so why bother with a remote? (Answer: because you have to use a remote to play the unit.) Also, I find this player gives me very little control. The bottom line is: if you want something good, get something else. You have to make the decision whether to pay under $100 and have nothing or pay $50 or $60 more and have a product that you want."
5,iPod Docking Station (White)/CD Boombox,"The setup of the boombox was very easy. The radio picks up stations very well. With the iPod in the boombox the sound is great! I am very pleased with my purchase. The price was excellent.Thank you,Tim"
1,never received,"I ordered this box two months in advance so I would have it for Labor Day. Accorcing to Amazon, item was in stock but the shipping kept getting pushed back because it ""wasn't in stock"". Once Labor came and went without it, I cancelled the order.I can't review the product because I never got it. I CAN say don't always rely on getting products through Amazon by a certain date."
1,Awful product!,"I received this as a Christmas gift December 2006. February 2007, it stopped working completely. Will not turn on, eject the CD that's currently in it, or play anything -- radio, iPod, CD, etc. I do not have the receipt anymore, and am going to have to trash it. I do NOT recommend this product, nor any other products by this manufacturer."
1,poorly designed,"Radio reception is very poor. Volume resets to 17 always, too loud. Entire system needs resetting frequently. Wished I'd read the reviews before purchase, I'd have saved the money. Mine's going to Salvation Army."
1,"1 star because there is no ""0"" star","I have to return this boom boom box, It does not work at all, and by this time I have no answer from the seller ""Amazon"". I can't believe Amazon can sell this. Please don't buy it."
1,Hissssssssssssssssssssss.........,Wow. I wonder if we can get a class action lawsuit against iLive to get reimbursed for or time and travel returning this piece of junk. I was feeling pretty good about it until I put my ipod in it; and then came the hiss. I thought I had rented the movie White Noise. My suggestion is to pony up some more bucks and buy quality.
2,"Good Theory, but not a practise book","This is a well written and concise booklet. Learned a lot of the practical theory behind the 5 Elements Chi Kung. The only problem is that there is only 5 or so small pictures of the actual practice session for each of the 5 Element forms so as an instruction guide its next to useless. This book is not for the user, whether beginner or advanced. There is no dvd media which is essential if you are serious about these sets of forms. There is a website in Taiwan which alludes to available media but no links to it. Courses are offered in Taiwan which is impractical for most people. So, I don't rate it that much considering there are lots of other decent media out there for these forms"
1,roller coaster volume,"It didn't take long to realize that something was amiss with this cd. Turns out the volume is decidely uneven from tune to tune. I was constantly adjusting before I finally threw the whole thing out. Plus this cd is just a bunch of tunes slapped together, with hardly a break in between, totally missing the thematic efforts put together by 'Flashpoint' and the 'L.A.Express' editions. It's even worse than 'Tom Cat'. But I guess that's what you might expect from a 'best of' rendition. You usually get what you pay for. In this case I didn't pay much, but I sure got a lot less."
3,Eh.,"I don't really need to go into detail for this one.If you're looking for a good first wand and are without trees to ask the gift of a limb from or don't want/need to spend a great deal of mony for a finely crafted and uselessly over-ornamented one,then just get the kit and ignore the book and it's super-fluffy approach to using the wand. (or you could always go with the Wandmaker's book,which is more of a fun,entertaining read being in the style of the ""Ology"" series,except that wand is even cheaper and likely to snap on you like a twig,and you might look weird invading the kids section of a bookstore to get a wand)If you're looking for a more serious instruction booklet or a more finely crafted wand,stay away from this,otherwise you might feel cheap and dirty for lowering yourself to getting the cheapest,most trite touchy-feely New Age take on magick...ever."
2,Fluff,*sigh* I got this book because I have been looking around for information on wands and on using them. The wand was a cute and the accompanying book is typical new age fluff disguised as magic. I gave two stars because it did have a couple of neat ideas I think I may be able to use after much tweeking. Look else where.
1,Hypocritical Nonsense,"As far as basic wanding skills and so forth, that's ok, but the authors views of other religons in th is book is ill researched. He is a Christian yet his views are of any but that, and claiming the devil in all other religons and doctrine and bla bla, yet he doesn't realize the Pagan origins of wanding and many other universal theories of his that contradicts his religon. I suggest getting a different book that is not conflicting with itself that doesn't put everyone that is not a Christian a devil and can't wand as well. lol Don't waste your money. He's a fruit that has twisted Pagan views and ect. to fit his Christianity views. lol As a practicing Pagan, I highly reccomend buying a different book on wanding and other energy and elemental practices."
2,Poor design,"Have been using scanner for office for about a year, automatic paper feeder jams quite often, and most annoyingly tends to pull the paper into the feeder mechanism when it jams, even if paper had already passed through, apparently attempting duplex scan. Duplex scanning itself cannot be set from computer but rather have to push button on scanner. Other than jamming and pulling multiple pages at once, has worked reasonably well. We are scanning papers that had been given to clients to fill out and are not pristine condition."
1,Pittiful OS X Support,"When is HP going to figure out that this is not 1998 and the Mac platform is not dying, and in fact growing faster than the rest of the industry.I agree with the other comments that the OS X support on this product is the bare minimum to legally say it is compatible. In the real world, I am not pleased.I love HP and like a lot of their products. But OS X software has to stop being and after-thought. If HP continues with the poor support, I might as well go with the cheaper Dell and get the same level of attention.NOTE TO HP: Most people who make their money in the creative field, and buy high end scanners and printers use the Mac. Get with it and know your target customers."
5,It's GRRREAT !!,"All I can say is ""Bring on the Poodle Skirts , drop top Chevy's and lets head to the Burger Joint!!!"" This CD is the greatest. My Mom and Uncle were dancing in the living room. I Love It. Thanks!"
5,greatest doo wop,doo wop songs are easy to listen to and also you can understand all the words that they are saying
3,Pretty and Functional,"As a retired chef, I found this knife to be about the middle of the road in both balance and performance. Yes, it does show rust spots if you air dry it but not every time. I make it a habit to towel dry all of my knives to eliminate water spotting. I clean with Bon Ami to eliminate rust spots that may appear but only with very light pressure as to not scratch the patina of the blade.This knife holds it's edge also in the middle of the road. I sharpen it a bit more frequently than other more expensive knives I own. I have given this whole set as gifts because it is so pretty but I would consider giving less knives of a higher quality to an avid cook where these would be used daily.It is a good price for what you get. With proper care, they will last a long time."
5,A film to sit back and just enjoy....nothing more!,"This film has all the elements that make for an enjoyable time. There's mutiny, over-bearing characters, the obligatory maidens in distress, and plenty of mutated sea creatures! The film moves along at a decent pace and it makes for a good viewing experience. There's also eight minutes of added footage that you usually don't have the pleasure of viewing on TV, so check it out! If you're looking for a good film to sit back and just relax with.....this is a good bet!"
3,This is quite a movie.,"Tramp streamer carrying this really explosive substince in cans springs a leak and gets trapped in a lost continent of seaweed, giant octupus, giant crabs, spanish inquistors, pretty girls, and scorpions. Tape has a great print and is letterboxed. I enjoyed it but they could have done a better job."
3,Truly Bizarre Minor Hammer,"What a loopy, loopy movie. After an hour of passable (and palpalbly sleazy) onboard thriller dynamics (with one actor that looks eerily like a young John Carpenter), the movie quickly evolves into an outlandish horror fantasy about a continent-sized mass of living (and biting) seaweed that drags our anti-heroes into a ship's graveyard populated by lost Spaniards. These Spaniards are ruled by a puppet boy king and they make their way over the mushy weeds and ocean beneath by harnessing a balloon to either shoulder. It gets a little surreal, folks. The whole movie is sickly orange in a rather fetching way, and if it all feels like bargain basement ""Ship Of Fools"" meets bargain basement Lovecraft, well, I guess it should also be said the inherent smarts and adult themes that were the trademarks of Hammer studios did extend even into most of these Anchor Bay obscuities. ""Lost Continent"" is as fun as it is odd."
3,Nostalgia for Hammer Films,I saw this once - ONCE - on tv one afternoon back in the 70s. Never forgot it. And it's just like remembered: WEIRD. It's got nothing AT ALL to do with Lost Continent and everything to do with rubbery monsters and cleavage. You like Hammer Films? You probably never saw this one. Get it!
3,Good B entertainment>>,"Spanish Galleons, Toxic cargoes, mystery women, shady captains and Sea Monsters, what more can you ask for?I saw this movie as a kid. I still enjoy those campy B movies. The 'sea monsters' and other effects are primitive by today's standards, but I still enjoyed this."
4,Gene Kelly and Judy Garland in their prime,"This delightful musical (in color!) follows the story of a young woman (Garland) who is in love with the pirate she has only read and dreamt about. On the eve of her marriage to another man, an actor (Kelly) becomes smitten with her and acts the part of the pirate she's always wanted. But where is the real buccaneer...? This movie must be seen by anyone who likes the classic musical."
1,Black Pirate,MGM has done it again. After an awful copy of The Naked Spur they gave us an even worst copy of The Pirate. They should be ashamed and try to make better copies of both films. I gave one star rate because the film is excellent.
1,The Pirate 1948,"I have read some of the glowing reviews of this awful film... Back in 1948 they dressed me and the record owners sonin Pirate costumers with a about 50 copies of the MGM album on the pretense of selling them after seeing the show.Needless to say we didnt sell ONE. We were give free passes to see the movie the next day and I could certainly see why this was a box office BOMB. I have read after all these years Minelli, Judy's husband at the time had the hots for Gene and was giving all his attention to Gene numbers. This kept Judy in a stew of pills and alcohol.To day this movie is a gem is like saying clorox smell like Armani Gio. It should be canned and trashed."
3,Gene Kelly at his best,"Simple story line to this movie starring Gene Kelly and Judy Garland. The sets are fun and some of the dance numbers may be ahead of their time. The best part is seeing Gene Kelly at his physical finest. He's fit and full of life. Judy Garland's health was suffering a bit while it was being made, but she managed to do an okay job. Over all it's worth a look."
2,So Disappointing,"I've seen most of Judy Garland's movies that are available either on VHS or DVD and other than the ones with Mickey Rooney, I had not found one I didn't like. That definitely changed with ""The Pirate"". All I can say about it is that it is completely ridiculous and was a major waste of money. As long as you stay away from the early films made with Mickey Rooney any other Garland picture is better than this one."
2,"Minnelli did make a few ""bombs"" during his MGM period and this was one of them.",Yolanda and the Thief and Brigadoon were 2 others! He made Gene Kelly look sexier than his wife did in this one!
2,I'm the only one who didn't care for it.,"Gene Kelly was very good in it, and it did have one very good musical number with Kelly, that I saved, after I recorded it from Turner Classic Movies.I saw it all, but erased the rest. I kept thinking, ""Did people actually pay to go in to see this weak movie, in 1948?""But everybody else loves it, so what do I know?"
4,One of Judy's Classics!!!,"I think this is one of Judy Garland's classic movies. She gives a performance as Manuela, the lonely island women who dreams about her hero, Mack the Black Macoco. Gene Kelly's dancing is fantastic! Also, the great songs ""Mack the Black"" and ""Be a Clown"" are wonderfully staged by director Vincente Minnelli. This movie really sucked me into it! This is a wonderful movie and the 2nd of which she was paired with Gene Kelly. While watching it, I couldn't believe that this was Judy's only film at MGM to lose money!"
4,Mellowing with Time,"The PirateIt is perhaps a bit late for a review; the movie is far from new and the stars are no longer with us. In addition, it had little if any success in its time. However, I find qualities in it which have only become more enjoyable each time I see Gene and Judy oh-so-delicately camping the pirate adventure movies of the time. Gene's rooftop trek is a gem--do you applaud or laugh? And Judy could do anything, but one of her best things was being a clown--what a great ending and what fun the whole thing is!By the way, I first saw it over sixty years ago, so I feel entitled to comment on the fine aging of ""The Pirate""."
4,A Film From The Golden Age,This is a golden film from Hollywoods Golden Age. It stars Judy Garland And Gene Kelly. It is very entertaining and makes you glad you have seen it.
1,Pirate(ed),"Have been a keen purchaser of all remastered MGM releases, I was eager to obtain a copy of this film. Alas I should have saved my money. The picture quality is poorer than my 20 year old video verson (it looks even more dreadful when screened through a home projector), sound quality is not much better. Unfortunatly no effort has been made to clean this classic up. There are no menus, and about 5 or so chapters inserted without any prior thought. Would suggest you wait until Warners get around to releasing this one and have been given the proper attention this Judy and Gene musical deserves. Can only face watching after a bottle or two of chardonney and a case of retinal!"
5,WOW!!,These sheets are like heaven! I highly reccomend them. Very soft and silky. Seem like they will hold up well over time.
1,Horrible service,"I ordered these sheets about 3 weeks ago. Linen Spa supposedly shipped the sheets soon after the order, but I never received it. UPS didn't show the package as delivered, so I don't know what Linen Spa was thinking. Maybe they were hoping I'd just forget about the order? Who knows? I emailed Linen Spa (don't bother calling, no one answers) and they offered to re-ship the package. I asked for my shipping charges to be refunded since they totally screwed up. They never replied and I've received no refund. I assume they're just ignoring me.The sheets arrived today and the color is MUCH darker than what is represented on this website. We'll see how they hold up. So far, I'm not impressed with Linen Spa at all, so I'm expecting the worst. I'll update this review as necessary."
4,Good fit and soft fabric,"Were made of very soft fabric, nice fit that stayed on the bed. Have not been through enough wash cycles yet to determine lasting quality."
5,Excellent set of sheets,Verry happy with my purchase. Wash and dry beautifully. Very soft and comfortable. Fit my bed perfectly. Would buy again.
3,Soft sheets,"Sheets were very soft and comfy, however the pillow cases that came with my queen sheets were standard sized not queen. Also when I washed them (Tide no bleach), the sheets came out with lighter and darker areas."
1,Don't use this companybuy these sheets!,"So I never write reviews, but this drove me to do it... I bought these sheets a few months ago. First, they messed up our order and had to contact to correct the order. They tried to send pillowcases instead of sheets. Then, we get the sheets and try them on the bed to make sure they fit (we have a deep pocket) and we don't even get the fitted sheet half way over the bed before it snaps. We contact the company who says, ""this never happens"" and then requires we send PHOTOGRAPHS to prove that it is broken. After we send them shots, they don't even ask if we want a refund they just send an email stating they are sending a second sheet. So, we decide not to deal with another round of emails and just keep the sheets. After ONE WASH they begin pilling.I will never buy these sheets again."
5,First japanamation i ever saw and now I want to see them all,Best series i have ever see and it was soo fuunie i bet you i seen all the episodes at least five times!! In fact i was watching one early today!! if you have ever seen one this is the one you should see next!!
4,Pop Goes The Cult!,"Although many fans criticize this and unfairly call it their ""disco album"", it happens to be one of my favorites( from the post ""Black and White"" [1st three albums]period). It might be Cult's most unique album; certainly nothing else they ever did sounded like this. ""Dr. Music"", ""You're Not The One (I Was Looking For)"", ""Moon Crazy"", ""Lonely Teardrops"" as well as the title cut(minor hit in '79)are all radio ready poppers. ""The Great Sun Jester"" is borderline prog-rock with a great acoustic intro, unusual for Cult. ""In Thee"", more acoustic guitar, is a gorgeous tune as well. It was on this tour that I first experienced them live, and became a fan for life ."
4,"BOC is without a dout,one of the best hard rock bands ever!","blue oyster cult has been a major part of influence and entertainment in the rock world!This recording shows not only musical and composing talent,but great lyrical content as well. buy it!"
4,woops!,"Although ""Dr. Music"" is an all time classic (it would be for any band) this is BOC as we must learn to like them.They had become jet-setting superstars and I am sorry to say this but they did lose their hard rock edge here.Now it could be seen as natural progression to want to write better songs which I admire.But none of the songs on Mirrors are truly memorable.For dedicated fans or completists (like me!).Dangerously close to Foreigner territory.What happened next you ask? Well..."
2,"Not a _bad_ album, but one of BOC's weaker efforts","While every BOC fan should, naturally, have _every_ BOC album, I have to take issue with the previous reviewer's statement that ""Mirrors"" is ""a great album"". Musically, it represents a misguided attempt to repackage BOC as a guitar-pop group along the lines of Cheap Trick (whose producer at the time, Tom Werman, was borrowed for this album -- his only work with BOC). Many BOC fans dislike this album so intensely that they prefer to call it ""Errors"". I wouldn't go quite that far, but I do think that of BOC's studio albums, only ""The Revolution By Night"" is worse than this one. Some of the songs are quite weak, particularly ""You're Not the One (I Was Looking For)"" -- an obvious ripoff of The Cars' ""Just What I Needed"" -- and the title track.On the plus side, ""In Thee"" is probably the prettiest ballad BOC has yet recorded, and ""Dr. Music"" is energetic and fun."
2,Back to psychedelia but where is heaviness?,"Where is hard rock? They most likely decided that people were tired of classic hard rock and they were right. By that time NWOBHM was beginning to kill off the old-timers, Deep Purple was disbanded and gone, Black Sabbath was producing same-sounding records every year, Led Zeppelin was done... so BOC probably decided what the heck, let's do pure pop with some psychedelic overtones. And they did! I give them credit for consistency here - there is not one real heavy metal song here at all! ""In Thee"" is more or less decent, ""Dr.Music"" and ""The Great Sun Jester"" are interesting for psychedelic fans, and what's in it for me? The answer is ""Lonely Teardrops"". That's the only track that somewhat saves this failure... then again I might be wrong. The song is pure pop and is just a unashamedly simple ballad but it is at least a very enjoyable and simple pop tune. Try it!"
2,BOC's weakest effort,"I hate to say anything bad about Blue Oyster Cult, but they've turned out a lot of recordings over the years, and some are bound to be better or worse than others. This one seems to have no purpose in life. BOC has always had two sides: the headbanging biker band on one side, and rock's answer to Edgar Allen Poe on the other. Mirrors fails to bring out either aspect of the band, so all that remains is a collection of forgettable tracks that could have been done by anybody. Devoted BOC collectors may want to buy this CD for the sake of completeness, but it's hard to recommend for any other reason. There are better BOC discs you can get."
3,BOC SurfMusic,"A well polished and liquid album.BOC seems to have a nack for pop in this ilicit production.It should have been radio friendly;in the ""Reaper""vein.A must for classic rock collectors!"
5,A prototype for the genre of pop-metal!,"I was not prepared to love this album, but Mirrors is a classic from start to finish! I think it is a prototype for the genre of pop-metal that would dominate the charts in the '80s. At least, Blue Oyster Cult did not follow the dominate trend of 1979, which was to incorporate disco into a band's tapestry of sound. B.O.C. stuck with tight vocal harmonies and a lighter guitar crunch. I should have known by the way I loved the track ""In Thee"" that I would have a deep appreciation for this album. It's very consistent... in a good way. Other B.O.C. releases are a bit all over the map as far as consistency is concerned. I'm a fan of all of the '70s and early '80s Cult albums, but this one holds a special place in my heart!"
4,Hard to Use,It should have been one piece like a placemat instead of being folded into thirds with a heavy laminate. I've got mine btwn heavy books hoping to make it lie flat.
1,Truly horrible... disco/fusion...Yikes!,"Is this Saturday Night Fever or Jazz? You decide. Better yet, get Elegant Gypsy instead."
4,Highly Recommend!!!,"Amelia Earhart captured the hearts of the world over 80 years ago and her life and untimely disappearance have always been a topic of great interest and intrigue. I think the author of this book has done a great job of sharing many of the life experiences that molded Amelia's personality and drove her ambitions. I did find one piece of information to be incorrect in regard to Amelia's husband G.P. (George Putnam) in which he was noted as having been married only one more time after Amelia when;in fact, he was married two more times.Overall, the book was a great read and I appreciated the details shared in regard to Amelia's ancestor's as well as her early life. Many opinion's have been written about that last fatal flight and the author did a good job of outlining the known facts leaving the reader to ponder Amelia's final outcome."
1,horrible.,i had to stop reading it after 14 %. i thought this book was about ameila but not only does she rarely get mentioned but the information about her is impersonal and brief. the author began ameilas story with her great great grandparents and basically anyone and everyone ameila knew is mentioned constantly. i could care less about any of these people really but susan butler uses them as a mirage to make you think youre reading into amelia. waste of brain space and paper if you ask me. i felt like i was reading an obituary. absolutly one of the worst books i attempted to read. her writing style is boring and textbook like.
5,A starry bio of singular aviatrix Amelia Earhart,"Susan Butler's biography of Amelia Earhart was called definitive by The New Yorker. Hillary Swank, star of the biopic AMELIA called East to the Dawn her bible when shooting the film and you can see why when reading this very thorough biography. It takes Earhart from cradle to uncharted disappearance over the Pacific during her round the world flights. It also unearths new information about her unconventional marriage to George Putnam. Earhart had a lover Eugene Vidal and was influential in getting him appointed First Bureau of Air Commerce under FDR.This biography tracks Earhart from her beginnings and her family history, through her childhood as an adventurous tomboy who built her own primitive version of a roller coaster to dedicated social workers to world famous,record-breaking aviatrix. Its a dramatic arc for one woman's life and Butler makes the most of it, using evidence and diaries that she alone unearthed."
2,Review of East to the Dawn,"I agree with the author who wrote the review, ""Excellent descriptions of her flights; short on criticism."" As an aviator and a student of history I was excited to find a book purported to have done such research on the subject. I was disappointed in the balance and lack of critical analysis. I was very disappointed in the writing skills of the author. There are numerous grammatical errors that are anathema to a writer who has honed her skills. These errors should not have escaped freshman composition courses. In addition there are a plethora of misplaced modifiers. I have had to reread many sentences to determine about whom the author is discussing.One review mentioned factual errors. Those errors lead one to question the accuracy or the rest of the research. Another reviewer questioned the balance of analysis and balance of the work. I have to agree with that reviewer.Overall the work is a bit disappointing."
4,Enjoyed This Book!,This was a very interesting and informative book.I feel like it really let me know Amelia.Only thing I did not like about it was that the begining wasa little slow. A little too much time spent on her ancestors.
3,"Michael Bliss, Harvey Cushing: A Life in Surgery Misses the Mark","Well done regarding HC's personal life, totally misses the surgical details I was hoping to find. Thus, Cushing's real contributions are not well represented. Would have liked to see more attention to anatomical detail and surgical procedures."
5,Good Product,"This 3/4"" tapered countersink seems to be well made, sharp, and durable. No complaints to date."
1,Missing pages Faltan paginas,"The copy I got jumped from page 49 to 247. Nearly 100 pages were missing. Some pages were duplicated, so the book was as thick as it should be. Amazon refuses to even accept an e-mail from me because it took me more than a month to get around to reading the book and realizing what had happened.Al ejemplar que me tocó le faltaron casi cien páginas. Algunas páginas estaban duplicadas así es que el libro quedó igual de grueso.Amazon no acepta mensajes después de 30 días. Así es que no pude informarle a nadie del problema"
3,Whitewater and White Knuckles,Will Eastburn has written a whitewater adventure with some surprising twists. The descriptions of the river-rapids and the other problems encountered are breathtaking and vivid. You are drawn into the story and want to know more about the characters and why they are on the rafting trip. The plot was engaging and fast moving. You are never really sure about what is going to happen. The climax was surprising and left you hoping the author writes another adventure story.
4,Computers In Your Future,"This book was the best beginners computer book I have found to date. I teach computers to Senior Citizens and middle aged adults. This book has helped me introduce them to computers with an understanding that is relative to thier way of thinking. It is not too technical so that the average person, someone who is not techie, can understand computers, their relationship to today's world and its future growth. I would recommend it to anyone who would like to get a look at computers from a non-heavy technical aspect."
1,"Should be called Computers of your past, Badly written","Blah, Blah Blah, This book is far too wordy. Would make anyone who knew the slightest about computers fall asleep, Dull! Would hate for a newbie to pick up this book, would make you fear computing. Alot of info prestented is out dated and sometimes down right WRONG! Best thing to do with this book is put it by your bed and if you can't sleep read a paragraph and you'll be fast asleep."
2,Not very up to date!,"This book has a lot to cover, but fails to deliver a decent amount of knowledge to anyone that has seen a computer in the last few years. It is so out-of-date it is rediculous! They updated it in certain parts and left out others. Not to mention the answers in the back for the reviews aren't correct? Definately not a good buy if you know how to spell the word computer...."
4,"Fully met my expectations, and came quickly","The tea I ordered came within just a few days, and the Lucky Eight Yunnan Pu Erh was totally comparable to the Numi Pu Erh I had been buying, but which was more expensive and harder to find."
3,Lucky Eight Yunnan Pu Erh Natural Black Tea,A good tea. Nice to have a different choice every once in a while and very robust in flavor. GREAT!!
1,Not what expected....,"This tea was not as expected. Don't know what fillers, if any, but caused me to itch and feel very shaky inside. Would not purchase again."
4,good,This tea has a very smooth taste. Ii have been making iced tea at of it. Very good. Was delivered quickly. Will repurchase again when needed.
3,It okay but not great,Used along with the Ceylon Tea as Recommended by Dr. Oz for weight loss. I drank this stuff 3 times a day for 2 weeks with no weight loss results. The tea tastes okay but not great.
2,Standard Fare,"A fine Pu Erh, not great, not bad, but tea of equal or better quality can probably be got for much cheaper offline."
1,a cup of mud!,This had a flavor like a the bottom of a swamp....don't waste your money!! I had a couple other people taste it too and they agreed with my assessment.
4,tea,The product arrived at my home quickly and is very tasty. I learned about this tea from the Dr.Oz show.
4,Good Product,"Arrived very fast and in a great condition. Good product, smells a little like fish in the beginning, but the taste is good."
3,Decent epic drama,"This movie has a slightly more intelligent script than other Steve Reeve sword-and-sandle epics, but the story and main characters are not as entertaining as compared to Reeves' earlier ""Hercules"" pictures. The sexy Sylva Koscina is also missing here. As usual, the clumsy dubbing is obvious, but adds to the charm of the picture."
3,"Reeves, big yawning battle scenes, classic accuracy","A long drawn out but fairly accurate account of the war of Troy. Reeves' amazing body is shown well in a few scenes, but the flick is like one stock footage battle opening after another. Still, some nice soldiers rolling around with their skirts flying up. If they'd only listened to Cassandra as to what was in that horse. Oh well."
2,great movie but terrible picture quality.,"this is one movie that is not as popular as the other Steve reeve's other movies like hercules, goliath & barbarians, morgan the pirate, romulus & remus, giant of marathon, thief of bagdad. i did not know that he did ""white warrior, last days of pompeii, and this movie ""trojan horse"" that is why i had to get this video. although i bought this new, the quality of the picture was awful. the movie was good but it's sad that quality of this copy was horrible."
3,Quick ship,"This thing showed up the day after I ordered it. It must have been near St. Louis or something. The item functions properly and is easy to hook up and get started. I'm just not sure it is a very good way to tame weeds as far as time goes. It does kill the weeds but it takes me three to four times longer to do the job over weed killer.Don't buy Roundup either. Go to your local farm store and buy the concentrate that farmers use. You can get a large bottle of weed killer with the same killing agent as Roundup for about $5-$10. That bottle will make 50 gallons of weed killer easy. We usually go through 5-8 bottles of Roundup a year, for $8 we have been covered for two straight years. Weed Dragon has been in basement sitting."
4,"I like it , but.","This unit is a snap to use. Connecting to the propane bottle is easy and it's easy to light. You really need a dolly to carry the propane with you and to help you move quckly if need be as well as moving along fence lines etc. I would have liked for it to have burned hotter to be more effective on green plants. On the other hand, I'm not sure anything will kill Nut Grass."
4,Weeds don't die easily,"Product is well constructed. It does, however, take a few repeat flamings over a period of time to kill the weeds."
3,OK with qualifications,"The tool works as advertised and is easy to use. However, for weed removal it is not entirely effective for existing weeds. To be fair, the documentation indicates that new weeds are manageable but for established weeds it may take several attempts. I found that I had to employ alternative methods to remove established weeds. It is, without doubt, best suited for removing new weeds from walkways, gravel paths, etc. As for fence lines it depends on what the surrounding environment is like and, as suggested in the guide, keep a fire extinguisher and water hose handy."
2,Good seller.....but not a great product,The dragon does burn the weeds.........uses a lot of propane and the weeds grow right back after about a week. Not a permanent solution to weeds. Use roundup.
2,Save your money,"It doesn't do what was said and can be dangerous, as it caught the grass on fire. Save your money. It's awkward to move around and doesn't affect a weed that is established and growing. Plus, it caught the garden mulch on fire. What a mess!"
4,Weed Burner,It is pretty easy to use and gets good results as long as one understands that it will take multiple applications to eradicate all weeds.
3,Propane Vapor torch,"I bought this item with high expectations which weren't exactly met. I expected it to burn live weeds; it's better to spray with vinegar first, then burn. Disappointing because I was trying to eliminate the spraying step."
2,Red Dragon VT 2-23 C Weed Propane Torch Kit,"It was studily built. Amazon was great in its speedy processing of my order. However I could not use it and had to return it. Its connector did not fit either the small camping propane canister, or the large barbecue propane tank. Amazon should clearly specify the connector of this product so that there would be no waste time and money from both the consumer and Amazon.I am still looking for a weed propane torch that will work for me."
3,It works.,"It isn't a 'flame thrower' like in the movies, but it's better than a match. It got the job done for me."
2,Dangerous In My Opinion,"I bought this last week direct from the company so that I could take advantage of a bundle deal. Wishing now that I had purchased from Amazon so that I could return this easily.I would imagine that this item would be great if you are using it for grass maybe or in an area that is bricked or concreted. In my case, in the woods with dry leaves on a gravel driveway and wind all the time it is a recipe for disaster. The flame is not very focused and unless you absolutely fry the weeds, they don't die. Even the young ones. I ended up pulling the weeds the next day around the house, but I guess I need to find another solution for my 800 ft. gravel driveway.In negotiation right now trying to return the torch. I'll post later about customer service."
4,Good product- takes practice!,"Easy to use, easy to set up, takes practice to know how long to flame live weeds. Depending on the weed 10-20 seconds is sufficient but other thicker mats with deep roots may take multiple treatment. Always keep a hose close by and keep flame straight up and down rather than sideways to be most effective. The gas trolley is made for a large tank rather than the average smaller tank you may have around for your barbecue. Sound construction. Oh yeah - its also fun."
3,"Good, but too powerful!","The product seems to be of good quality and works well (a little too well). However a 100K BTU is probabaly too much for the average suburban user. When turned on 'full blast' The cone of flame covers a good 12 inch area, and the kill area is probabaly another 6-12 inches. If I throttle it down to 'low' it seems to work better, but it is still a little much for 'spot treating' weeds on my quarter acre suburban lawn.--DD"
4,Be careful,"Does exactly what it says it does, burn weeds. But, this thing can use propane fast!!! Not as thrifty as I thought it would be."
3,Burning Bush,"Using the Weed Dragon was easy it torches the weeds but you still have to pull then out. Is there a better way to use it? I was using it on the rocks near a bush which had leaves under it and it caught on fire. It quickly started burning the bush, luckily for my neighbor who brought a hose over the fence to put it out. Before starting using it always make sure you have the water turned on and a hose ready just in case./ Be careful using it. You don't want to start a fire."
4,This thing is HOT!!,"The first time I used this was on my gravel driveway. I've tried round-up and weed be gone but these 'chemical's' which I don't like to use seem to loose their punch after a while. The dragon zapped the weeds and such very well. This location is not my permanent residence and after coming up the next week-end I noticed I got a little close to my pine tree next to the driveway. It was singed. I guess I got a little close. This thing really throws off the heat. I got the cheaper unit that doesn't have the throttle and I found that the wheel that controls the gas output works just fine. It takes a little getting used to thoough. I haven't tried it on ice or bonfires etc. yet. Overall this thing works great, just don't get too close to things you care about."
5,Flame ON!!!!,Awesome lil flame / weed killer not to mention its always a sure fire lite with the provided spark flint tool. I totally recomend this for anyone who need to get rid of pesky weeds or make a fire safely from a distance for smokers as well.
4,Excellent value for the money!,Musicals from Hollywood's Golden AgeThere are a lot of quality movies on this DVD. Good clean entertainment! I enjoyed them very much. Great value for the money.
1,Worse than awful. Sham tool,"This is a plastic replica of a tubing cutter. If you try to use it on even a soft copper pipe, you will struggle to get one or two cuts and then it will fall apart. Shame on the manufacturer for passing this off as a tool. This is complete garbage and you would have better luck cutting tubing with a butter knife. I took it back and replaced it with a Rigid. The picture looks the same, but what a difference in quality. Absolutely worth the difference in price."
1,If only I could give it a zero star,don't buy broke on the first try. The knob that makes the device tighten or loosing striped I had to pull a McGyver to to finish cutting through the tubing. Manufacture Shame on you!!!!!
2,"Worked, ONCE","I bought this to cut a bicycle fork steer tube. And it broke a little over half way through. I was able to finish the job and I think I will be able to fix it, but it breaking before I even finished using it just once is pretty unacceptable if you ask me. The bolt that holds the cutting wheel on is what broke. At first is loosened up, so I tightened it, then it did the same thing again and when I tried tightening it again, it was stripped out. I am going to just go get a nut and bolt from Ace and put it through there, so it will still be functional for me. Like I said though, it should have lasted for longer than one use."
3,Cutting wheel issues,"I purchased this product under the impression that I could use it to cut my golf shafts. But apparently after cutting 7 shafts, the cutting wheels developed some spots where the sharpness of the blade was lost. I am still able to cut it golf shafts but requires more effort."
5,They bring sanity to the cult of inclusiveness,"This book is a refreshing reality check for what diversity training is doing to American corporate pool of employees. We are poisoning our own human resources through the divisiveness brought about with this absurd philosophy. Very well researched with survey results of over 500 corporate executives, this is the first diversity book I've read with any sources whatsoever. They had tremendous courage to publish it in the midst of extreme political correctness. For once, intellectual honesty and rationalism takes a stand. This book should be required reading for every CEO who has mandated diversity training in their company."
2,Ditto (Almost),"The first half of the book was pretty good and pretty accurate. It describes what I have always felt - that most businesses do a very poor job at attempting to tack diversity. While it does have some good tips, the last half of the book is more of a solicitation for their ""tool."""
4,Another treat from Ms. Palmer!,"Bound by a Promise by Diana Palmer ~Silhouette Special Release ~ originally published in 1979When Kate's fiance brutally drops her because she's not wealthy like he thought, she takes a job as secretary for a romance author. Garet made it to the top in aeronautics because of his talent as a pilot and an engineer and his ruthless approach to business. Kate sees her boss' neighbour as arrogant with his nose in the air, and Garet see the wisp of a girl as a spoiled brat determined to have her way. A tragic accident leaves Garet blind and bitter, and throws Kate into his world. Only Kate knows the truth of the accident and she's living on the edge until the day Garet remembers her and what she did. Awesome! Another treat from Ms. Palmer!"
2,"had good potential, but","wheres the sex?? And can Plamer stop using the term ""little one"" to all of her heroines."
2,I hate these,The idea behind these crayons is great. They feel and look like markers (which my kid loves). The problem is that the crayon is in a plastic encasement and most of the crayons fell right out within 1 - 2 uses. Once they fall out - they won't stay in and are therefore unusable. Concept: great. Execution: horrible.
4,FAILURE:Million Man March,"Ok, this book says publicly what has been whispered in the Black community for 10 years and what the White community is to frieghtened to say: the Million Man March was a failure. The book doesn't say that in one sentence, but says it none the less.Yet before you celebrate some un-spoken joy consider this as a failure of the Million Man March: The speed at which Hurricane Katrina was labled a problem of savages.Yes this is a book with a unique view of race relations that uses humor much as Chris Rock is the de-facto Black leader of today, while Bill Cosby attempts to introduce the concept of bootstraps to American Negro culture.Don't worry there are sex scenes but somewhere between the ""N"" word and the words ""Jurry Curl"", there appears to be not a single expletive in this book.Somehow this book frees one from the Jesse Jackson/Archie Bunker mentality of race."
1,Bulldog Drummond Escapes,"While the film may have been a good entry into the B movie world, the transfer by Alpha Video was not.A large part of the credits are off the screen. The transfer is dark, blurry at times, and generally not very enjoyable.Fortunately, I have the Image Entertainment version as well and recommend it over the Alpha Video attempt."
3,Dashing good fun,"Yes, they are both B grade films with low production values, but both show the real strength of Hollywood, when even their second string efforts have something. I doubt if Hollywood could put out a film with such effortless ease now. Ray Milland plays a somewhat daffy Bulldog Drummond, while John Howard is lot sterner. Both films rattle along with dastardly and bearded villans. I liked them both."
3,Not very happy,The picture quality of this VHS tape was very unsteady. It required some additional devices to steady the picture. but this was not a complete success. The sound track too was poor. It could be linked to the unsteady recording I had a previous copy with a dark print but a good sound track... so I matched to p\ir on my film edit programme. Several hours of uneeded work I have a very good NTSC VHS player.
2,Not supportive enough,"I find this collar to be too ""soft"". It does not provide enough rigid support of my neck and that was the very thing I was looking for. Not recommended..."
4,Beautiful well constructed Doll,"Shopping for ""baby dolls"", saw many but this one caught my eye. Artistry of this doll superior, craftsmanship exceptional, lovely all the way around. Bought a 14 "" doll thinking that it would be better suiited for a 3 yr. old .... But the 3 yr. Old grand-daughter loved this life like baby doll. The eyes do not close, but they are a beautiful blue. Heavy cuddly baby doll that a 3 year old can drag along for playtime, feeding time, and bedtime....found a lot better price than currently shown, so shop around for this 2010 introduced baby doll....great... Cute....realistic"
5,Still Sounds Great!,"Here's a late-seventies singer-songwriter at the top of his form - from the title cut (his only top forty hit [#7 in late 1979]), to ""White Rhythm And Blues"" (covered by Linda Ronstadt on her lp ""Living In The USA"") to ""The Last In Love"" (covered by George Strait on ""Pure Country""). Does anyone else see a pattern here? Yes, he's been covered frequently (mostly by Ronstadt), but the original still sounds great! Check this one out, you won't regret it!"
2,One lonely song,"Other than You're Only Lonely, the rest of the songs on this album were a waste of time."
4,A Gem From The 70's,"I own the original LP on vinyl when it was 1st released. I was so pleased to be able to buy it in CD format. No, it's not the Japanese remastered edition, but the audio sound is still incedible. Unless your a professional audio engineer, it's next to impossible to hear a difference. Souther may not be the word master as a songwriter ala PF Sloan or Karla Bonoff, but he has a remarkable voice. One of the best to emerge from the 70's list of great singers in pop music. His voice elevates almost all the songs he records in studio. The top 3 songs from this disc, are the title track;""You're only lonely"",""If you don't want my love"", and""White,rhythm an blues"". An exceptional buy at this price! Paul from ""Talk n' Roll"""

4,Oh Poe Me,"George C. Scott and Val Kilmer shine in this rendering of E.A. Poe's mystery. The big name stars and excellent scenery add immensely to this take of the story. Short enough to keep you interested all the way through, this one should be checked out if you like Scott or Kilmer or a good detective story. 4 stars for this one. It made me feel like I was back in a high school lit class watching a video on required reading."
3,Teacher Resource,"This film is not a fabulous, but it is entertaining. Val Kilmer played a great role as Phillipe, but George C. Scott left something to be desired in his portrayal of the clever August Dupin. As a teacher of American Literature I have no problems showing this as a supplement to our study of Edgar A. Poe. However, to the average movie watcher, this one might put them to sleep."
5,Truly amazing,"For english, we watched this and i thought it quite different from other mysteries ive heard. Though it was astonishing none the less. I was quick to assume the killer, but wrong in my detection. This movie is quite unlike the actual writings of Edgar Allan Poe, but great anyhow."
1,Advertised as Waterproof but warranty doesnt cover it and out of an IPOD now.,"This is the worst advertised POS i have ever seen. Its advertised as ""WATERPROOF"" and has the image of a surfer along with tests being submerged for 30 minutes. I had mine under water for less than 5 minutes and followed instructions exactly. It leaked the first time of usage and ruined my 30 gig IPOD. After advertising as being waterproof, their warranty doesnt cover it as such. Im pissed and out of a 30 gig ipod now. Do NOT Purchase this Item, Period !"
1,Wrong size,Description says this will fit a 30/60Gb I pod but it will not. I ordered the item and found it was for a Nano. I returned it and was sent the same thing... still would not fit. Apparently this item is mislabeled somewhere along the line.
5,Exhaust Tip,Excellent tips. They look geat on my classic car. Amazon was the best price and shipping.
2,"bad bit, pretty good template","This combo was barely acceptable for my purposes, which was drilling holes in one door made of veneered particle board. The bit is so dull and such poor quality that it had a difficult time finishing two holes... and wood doesn't get much softer or easier to drill than particle board. The template, however, is pretty good.The bit is garbage, and the price is too high for just the template."
4,Works great with Epson photo printers,"I have found with Epson photo printers the only way to get great printouts is with Epson photo paper. This is good quality photo paper though, and well worth the money if you own an Epson photo printer."
1,Confusing to say the least,"This was the first print book of Sylvia's I read. I had gotten a couple of her lectures-on-tape from the library (as much stand-up comedy as spirituality). In the first one (""Making Contact ..."", I believe) she categorically, emphatically stated that one does NOT ""see auras"" - she goes so far as to suggest that those who claim to do so see an eye doctor. On Page 11 of this book ""Francine"" spends two paragraphs referring to aura colors, specifically on ""cementing"" one's aura to green or blue. Contradictory? I think so.I'll be honest, the more I read of Sylvia, the more skeptical I become."
3,For Sylvia Fans,"I enjoyed this book. BUT it does come off as gathered bits put together, much of which seem to be from sessions at her church. Much of the content is also rehash from previous books - verbatim in spots. Her books also seem to be coming out at a good clip. That said, there were many points that gave me pause to ponder, which is why I buy, read and generally enjoy such books."
1,rip-off,"This book's title (""Contemporary Plays"") is completely misleading. There is no play in this anthology written after 1920. The earliest seems to be 1888. For $22.95 you get a Google digitized scan of an out-of-copyright book filled with plays the vast majority of which most definitely do not stand the test of time."
1,dont bother buying,"when the fuel pump arrived .it did not come with instructions ,or an invoice .....thank god my husband knew what he was doing .. but after 3 weeks the fuel pump just quit working now he has to go threw all that work again, it seems like it was a return that amazon got mixed up and sent it back out as new ..."
3,"good yoga but needs a better , more colorful presentation.","I am rather dissapointed by the this workout. Long and sometimes boring, though very well flowing for the body. I am sure it will strongly benefit those who will daily stick to it."
3,Too Many Cooks Spoil the Broth,"This is a case of too many cooks spoiling the broth as Jane is produced here by three different people (back before production by committee was customary). The results vary, depending on the producer. The songs produced by Jason Darrow, Olivor's longtime producer, are far and away the highlights (the title cut and ""Vagabond""). The Louie Shelton cuts seem a departure for Jane, in terms of style and substance, but all in all, more than satisfactory. The nadir are those produced by Michael Masser (""To Love Again"", ""Greatest Love of All"" etc.) -- wildly overproduced, forcing Olivor to oversing to be heard over the globs and globs of orchestration. Somehow, this just isn't the same Olivor who thrilled us back with ""First Night."" And WHY Columbia released ""Don't Let Go of Me,"" rather than the brilliant title cut, as the single, reflects the mismanagement of Olivor's career. Great pix of Jane though -- finally!"
3,HAD TO COMPLETE MY COLLECTION!,"These songs are not Jane's greatest, but I wanted this CD to complete my collection of her fabulous work and to be able to bring it with me to her concert so it could be signed by her. :-)"
4,Best of late-era RTF,"Fairly good collection, definitely some good stuff here, but be aware that this is the late-era, ""big band"" version of RTF. The _real_ good stuff is earlier editions of RTF (see ""Return to the 7th Galaxy""), but this version isn't bad, and also acts as a good intro to Chick's following solo albums (Mad Hatter, Leprechaun, etc.)."
4,Red Dragon,Overall the Red Dragon does the job. What it could have to make handling easier would be a hand grip with perhaps a trigger.
3,Fun to use but weeds are tough little buggers,"Even though this torch is fun to use, the weeds resist the flame much better than they resist chemical treatment (Roundup). I've found that a week later the same weeds are growing back, even when I burn them to ash. The best way to use this torch is in conjunction with a good line trimmer. You'll be using lots of gas if you don't cut the weeds down first. I'll keep burning them and see if eventually they just give up and die for good but so far it does not look promising."
3,Way too powerful for most of my weeding needs.,"I got this to kill moss on my brick patio, weeds on my rock path and flower/vegetable gardens, and to melt ice of my steps. It is scary loud and too powerful for killing weeds that are growing within 5 feet of any plant you don't want to hurt. I do plan on using this to control moss and to melt ice on walk ways. Although, I think torches melt ice surprisingly slow from everything I've read and seen in video's. I would recommend this to someone who needs to weed a large area, but not for weeding a flower garden. For torching weeds near other living plants, I would recommend theBernzomatic Self-Igniting Torch."
2,Red Dragon Propane Torch,No instructions were included on how to assemble the fittings. Though I figured it out and it functions check Sears first. i found a similar Torch that also included a squeeze handle (see my review on Flame engineering handle) for less than these two components cost on Amazon.
4,Complete to a fault -- For serious fans only,"Unless you are a hardcore KC fan, skip this 2 CD set, and instead get ""The Best of KC & the Sunshine Band [Rhino 1990]""If you want some kitschy fun, that disc has it in spades. This double CD has lots of retro fun, also -- in fact, too much.The double set has too many unremarkable songs, and lots of filler. Three (count 'em -- 3) versions of ""Please don't go,"" including one in Spanish (""Por Favor no te Vayas""); An instrumental version of ""Rock Your Baby,"" (wherein the Sunshine Band erroneously mistakes themselves for Duke Ellingtons orchestra), and covers of great motown hits like ""Same Old Song"" and ""Dancin' in the Street.""All told, the single disc has all of the great KC tunes you remember from the radio of your youth (or every Bar Mitzvah and /or wedding you've ever been to) without all the useless filler.You can listen straight thru without having to skip skip skip, skip skip skip, to the bootie . . ."
5,Here's to 25 more,"A few weeks ago, I ran out in a pouring rainstorm to retrieve this CD that I had accidentally left in my car. Why? Because I just had to listen to ""I Betcha Didn't Know That"" at that very moment. That's what KC and the Sunshine Band's music does to a person. They were an indelible part of my childhood and, because they were an actual BAND rather than just someone singing to an electronic backup, the music still holds up today. (Go see them live if you don't believe me.) This CD is probably the most complete collection of their music available; like the other reviewers, I have to question the inclusion of so many Please Don't Gos at the expense of other music not available on CD anywhere else (Come To My Island, anyone?). But then there's that trippy remix of Get Down Tonight that I love...and the Teri DeSario duets...and Shotgun Shuffle...and the unbelievably upbeat Do You Feel Alright...somehow I always do after hearing their music. Here's to 25 more years of sunshine."
2,kc band,"It was a little too much of nothing as far as music but not overly bad too listen too, in very good shape."
3,MP3 Download Listing,"I have the original 2-disc CD set, and according to this listing, they are missing several songs.Dancing In The Streets, Give It Up, and Please Don't Do '92 US RADIO EDIT. All together there was 15 tracks on first disc, and 16 on second. This listing only has 27 songs total. Hmm. Oh, well, I got my two disc set. Too bad though, that Please Don't Go Radio Edit is excellent dance stuff. And where's ""Yes, I'm Ready."" That was also on CD disc."
4,Price Gouging,"The product is exactly what my grandson wanted, however when I contacted the LEGO company about the outragous price charged for 15 pieces of plastic, they informed me that their suggested retail price was $9.99 not the $49.99 I paid for a shelf worn toy. Just beware of the retail stores that play on the toy fads and gouge the prices."
2,"Lack of Support, Expensive to Print","I have had this printer for just over a year. I've found it very expensive to print in color, we used to use it to print handouts. We have to replace the print cartridges about every 1000-1200 pages. At over $100 per cartridge X4 that's too expensive for us.Also the support is something that I hope that you never need. I've spent hours attempting to get the ability to select printing in color of grey scale back to the printing prefs tab. There is supposed to be a color tab, but the drivers (even the ones directly from HP Support) are lacking this tab and/or button. So I have to install re-install a different driver every time I desire to switch between Grey Scale and Color printing."
2,Queen size??????????,"I had a queen size bed now I have a full size thanks to the topper. The topper measures 55x75. I bought sheets with deeper pockets to accomodate the foam, which I thought would measure 60x80, but no............the sheets just bunch up. To say that I am disappointed is a gross understatement. The topper is comfortable but not LARGE enough."
1,UNUSABLE,"ADVERTISED AS A QUEEN SIZE BUT IT'S WAY TO SMALL. ABOUT 6"" ALL THE WAY AROUND IT. I DON'T KNOW HOW TO EVEN GET THE AIR BACK OUT TO GET IT FOLDED FOR A THE BOX. I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH IT."
1,Too Small!,"First of all, they are rolled up like a sleeping bag when you get them and you have to carefull PEEL them apart.Second, it takes over a week before they regain their size and thickness.Third, I got a king sized one for our RV and it is a better fit on the rv sofa sleeper. It's at least 12"" small on all four sides for the king sized bed.Don't know how I am ever going to be able to get them packaged back up into the little rolls now to ship them back to get my $$$ back..."
4,Sleeping on a cloud,"We installed foam pad over a 2 year old Serta Mattress, wesleep better with less back pain. We are VERY pleased with itand highly recommend it."
1,Topper Lasts 6 months Tops,"I purchased this topper June 2006, and at first loved it.This was a great purchase until it started to shrink, deflate, and discolor. What a waste! The pad used to be 3 inches think, but it has shrunk significantly in all directions and thickness. It has lost its cushiony quality, and is now uncomfortable. There also appears to be no way to get in touch with the company to inquire about what has gone wrong here."
4,A Good Night's Sleep,At 79 by bones hurt when I lay in one spot to long. The Memory foam mattress topper alows me to sleep longer and deeper. I am raising a 12 year old who has sleep overs. For an extra mattress I just pull the topper off my bed and put in on the floor. The 12 year olds say this works great. The price of this topper worked into my budget nicely.
2,Sliced in a dirty warehouse ... target practice ...,"I received my king size memory foam mattress topper today. I was discouraged when upon unfolding I discovered a rip on one side, and a slice in the middle that went all the way through. If you are going to sell me a piece of foam, at least don't use it for target practive first! Also one edge of the foam was dirty as if from a warehouse floor. This is not the way to handle products for a mattress. Who knows where this foam has been? I need to know my foam is clean if I am going to put it on my bed. I am discouraged. I doubt if I can get the product back in its box to return it. It arrives compressed in a hard ball and expands when you open it to the air. Amazon, any suggestions?"
3,SIZE NOT AS ADVERTISED,"THE TOPPER IS 55 INCHES BY 72 INCHES, NOT THE 58 BY 77 INCHES. BARELY LARGE ENOUGH FOR OUR DOUBLE PULL OUT SOFA. I HESITATE NOW TO ORDER THE KING SIZE FOR OUR BED."
1,Wrong Size,The merchandise is smaller than the size it is suppossed to be. They know it but the reasons they state to justify the smaller size are not valid.
1,Military history at it's worst,"In Rommel: Battles and Campaigns, Macksey (a British officer in WWII) continues his efforts to atone for British defeats in France and North Africa by painting the German military leadership as incompetent. This book is less of an objective review of Rommel's campaigns, but rather a poorly masked attempt to completly discredit any and all actions taken by Rommel in WWII. The strong bias in this account is evident within the books first few pages and continues throughout the volume. I have tried to read this book twice without success. The unbalanced nature of the account is so annoying that after my second attempt the book found it's rightful place in my circular file. Hence this review.Avoid this one like the plague! There are too many numerous and well written accounts of Rommel's war record to waste time on this one."
1,Doesn't Last too long!,This item smelled really good when I opened it. But the good smell only lasted for about a week at most. I will not buy again! The label says it lasts up to 30 days. NO it last about 7 days!
4,Slow but Sure,"I carried this book around with me for awhile, trying to make it through the first chapter. I make a habit of reading and finishing whatever I've purchased, no matter how bad or how long this takes. A lot of times I find it worth my while. That is the case with Sin In Souls Kitchen. Hold out past the first chapter and you'll be hooked through to the end. I guarantee. ...Talk about a 'sick chick'. Her name is Chelsea and she's got major issues. A major manipulator. What she gets away with in the name of the 'coochie' is insane. ... Learn some lessons from this brothers book and tape it to your mirror. It might save you some heartaches as well as nightmares."
3,So-So Book,"It took me a while to get into the flow of the book but once I did, it was a pretty decent book. However, the ending totally ticked me off. There was plenty of drama but the ending made all the drama rather pointless. What's the use of drama if you don't learn from it? Why suffer through so much tragedy if you're just going to end up back at square one?"
4,Black revolutionist vs Bourgeoisie wannabes,"Read Sin in Soul's Kitchen and prepare to go on a psychotic roller coaster. Thad, with a Columbia MBA in hand is going against the grain and into business with his buddies. A plan they had all worked out. He is doing this much to the dismay of his father and his Girlfriend, Chelsea. Chelsea has her own agenda for Thad, and it does not include his friends or his business. But the real drama starts when Thad ""sins"" and he must, according to Chelsea atone for these sins. By the time you finsh with Sin in Soul's Kitchen, you will wonder who is the real psychotic one. Excellent novel and highly recommended."
5,GOOD!,"Follow Thaddius Carmichael Jr., a young man fresh out of college and on his way to join the family company. Or so his father thinks. He has some plans of his own and they're all about to come true. That is until his perfect and larger than life girlfriend, Chelsea Fuller, sticks her nose in it. She wants the perfect life and will do ANYTHING to get just that.As things move from bad to worse with them, revelations, secrets, and a touch of insanity leaks on the pages and the conclusion is nothing you've ever seen. You'll be convinced you know the ending and blown away when the truth finally comes out.Andrew Ore weaves a tale where you really believe these characters and all their wild antics. A stunning job and can't wait to dig into more from him."
2,WHERE IS THE SIN IN THIS BOOK,"FIRST OFF THE COVER OF THIS BOOKMIGHT HAVE YOU THINKING THISIS A HOT BOOK. THIS BOOK HAS ITSGOOD PARTS, BUT IT HAS ALOT MOREBORING PARTS. YOU HAVE THIS GUY THAD,HE COMES FROM A NICE FAMILY, HE JUST GOTOUT OF GRAD SCHOOL, AND HE PLANS TO GOIN BUISNESS WITH HIS FRIENDS FROM THE HOOD, BUT HIS FARTHERWANT HIM TO WORK FOR THE FAMILY BUISNESS.THEN YOU HAVE THAD'S GIRL SHE ALSO DOES NOTWANT HIM TO OPEN A BUISNESS WITH HIS FRIENDSSO SHE TRIES HER BEST TO STOP HIMHE FALLS FOR ANOTHER WOMANHIS GIRLS GOES CRAZY BECAUSE SHE IS OBSESSED WITHTHAD, AND BLAA BLAA BLAA BLAA, THE BEST PART OF THIS BOOKWAS THE SHOCKING ENDING"
4,All the right elements,"Sin really gets off to a slow start, but it starts to really heat up! As a African American male, I was able to identify with the main character, Thad, as he wrestled with the struggles of RELATIONSHIPS, LOVE, LUST, FAMILY, ENTREPRENEURSHIP, and FRIENDSHIPS. This book held my attention and I highly recommend it."
3,Money Money Money,"The kids like it. Of course, they are second graders. The poor 5 has such a hard time staying attached. Decides to do his own thing and slide down the board. Takes a pretty strong magnet friend to hold him up."
3,wish they were bigger,"I used these to teach 1st graders how to count money. I loved the way the magnets allowed them to adhere to the white board. However, I wish that they were about 3-4 times larger so that all students could see them well."
2,2 1/2 stars,"I was so glad to see I wasn't the only one who thought Alice was an annoying, selfish prude. She may have been a Goody-Two-Shoes, but she was so controlling and unlikable. Lucien was a wonderful hero but she wanted to call the sheriff when he killed a guy in self-defense. And if that wasn't prim enough, she was flipping out because she went riding with him without a chaperone. And some of the dialogue was so dramatic it was hard to believe.Give this one a miss. Damien's story is more realistic and gripping."
5,another great by foley,"Lord of Fire features the younger twin, Lucien, who is a soldier-turned-spy...and alone. In order to obtain enemy information, he forms a secret ""club"" in the Grotto...until one night, when an innocent walks in on his party...Alice Montague, prim and virtuous, is shocked to discover Lucien's underworld, yet needs to find her sister-in-law in order to bring her back to her son. This is fine, until she finds herself trapped in Lucien's ultimatum, to live with him for a week.Add on action scenes like no other and a sneakpeek into his twin's life and it results in a well-rounded, carefully thought out romance novel that is definitely not your average roll-in-the-hay. So far, Foley has not disappointed me. Her books broach subjects that other authors maybe are...afraid...to approach in a romance novel, but I feel that she integrates it seamlessly into her stories. Bravo!"
2,p-l-e-a-s-e,"If you like the following sentence you'll like the book:""At her soft, hesitant words, he trembled in her arms, lifted his lashes slowly, and pinned her in a tortured stare.""If, on the other hand, like me, you find it over the top, avoid the book."
5,Where's My Lucien Knight?!,"I thought that this book was great. I enjoyed it immensely and found that it was hard for me to put it down. i bought it when it first was published and I have read it several times now. It's just as exciting as the first time. I thought that Lucien was so sexy and adventurous; I found myself wishing I was in Alice's shoes. The eroticism and danger reverberated throughout the novel and when I finally closed the book, I found myself wanting more. A definite success for Kane. I am a fan for life."
2,Ugh,"It's not that I fault the writing of this book. It just wasn't for me. The plot was very contrived and compared to Lord of Ice, it was a sad example of what this author is capable of.I don't like the type of storyline where someone who is actually a nice and virtuous person is forced into a situation they don't want to be in. I also don't like when the heroine is so spineless and innocent she can't hold her own against smoldering eyes or lusty kisses. I don't like when the heroine is unerringly drawn to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. And I don't like when the hero sees an innocent woman and just must have her, no matter the consequences. All of these things happen in this book. I was cringing through the first 1/3 of the book because I knew the heroine's obnoxious innocence was going to get her into trouble. Just not something I could recommend to anyone."
2,Loved the Hero....,"""Lord of Fire"" had so much potential, but it never really did it for me. The only reason I gave this book 2 Stars is because I LOVED Lucien, but I just couldn't get past the way this book was written and how unbelievable it was."
2,Just OK,"After reading (and re-reading) the Duke I anxiously looked forward to this novel and the companion ""Lord of Ice"". I was very disappointed. The characters had no depth and the story never caught my attention. Not a keeper-sold this one to Half Price Books."
3,"Good, not great","Most of Santana's more pop-oriented albums pale in comparison to the ""Holy Trinity"" of his first three albums (and the overlooked and underrated Caravanserai). ""Marathon"" features the hit ""All I Ever Wanted"" and other fairly well-crafted pop songs. The Latin influence (and fire) is at a minimum, but the albums generally get worse from this point on."
4,Effervescent and Refreshing,"Sometimes everything just clicks into place and you know that it is as it should be. The trendy term today for this phenomenon is, I believe, ""Feng Shui."" Whatever you want to call this coming together in harmony, its presence permeates this excellent recording. Carlos infuses each song with his special sound of spirits crying for enlightment---but without the excessive pyrotechnics that sometimes make his albums tiresome after repeated listenings. I agree with the other reviewers who note that the sublime keyboards of Alan Pasqua hit just the right note and that vocalist Alex Litgerwood delivers the perfect tone to these songs. My favorite song, though, is the haunting, transcendent instrumental, Aqua Marine, which will calm jagged nerves and inspire you to scrawl lines in the sand or spin a few haiku."
5,SANTANA' S BEST,"SANTANAS BEST FOR MY MONEY. A GREAT COMBINATION OF ROCK,JAZZ,AND R&B. NOT A BAD CUT ON ALBUM. EXCELLENT BAND AND VOCALS ESPECIALLY ON BASS. GREAT BASS SOLO ON STAND BACK! THIS ALBUM IS WORTH EVERY CENT. BUY IT AND ENJOY!"
4,STILL ROCKS,"I purchased this on vinyl when it came out and I still like this album. Carlos still had the fire in his belly. What he's doing nowadays is OK but I can't get too worked up about it. He has softened up his sound and records sales go up, wow, not THERE'S A shocker!!Even though I am not too excited by what he's doing these days Carlos will always have a place in my heart. Although he's got some good stuff out there his first 3 CDs are still classics to me. Listen to the track TOUSSAINT L'OVERTURE from his 3rd album, for me THAT was the classic Santana sound and nobody did THAT better!! Nobody!![..]"
3,Show me the way..,"This album ranks least among many good releases for this great artist, and was the first Santana album to drop below the 500,000 sales mark necessary for gold record certification.The music on this CD falls, some in the Pop Rock genre and some in the Latin Rock, yet it is difficult to give it a perfect identity or description. Santana seems lost between his love for the Rock Jazz Fusion music, his worries about sales and his commercial rank among the big Rock artists.Bottom line ""Marathon"" is for the hardcore Santana fans only.Other great Santana releases:1. Santana2. Abraxas3. Santana III4. Love, Devotion and Surrender. (Jazz-Rock-Fusion)5. Caravanserai (Jazz-Rock)6. Carlos Santana and Buddy Miles."
3,Anthology of the distant period of Piper' s future history,"Not Piper's best, these stories carry a sort of gloominess. The feeling is that humanity is on the decline and decandence prevails at the center of human civilization, while decay has already claimed the less important worlds. An interesting story about a nearly forgotten Earth in a future Ice Age."
2,"Obsolete edition - get the newer one; also, poor intro to characters","Elizabeth Scurfield's Chinese texts and material are generally very good, but I recommend not getting this for two reasons:1) It's an old edition that has been replaced with a newer one at the same price, and it uses audio cassettes instead of CDs. (If you only have a cassette player, perhaps in the car, you might consider this anyway.)2) The textbook waits far too long to introduce Chinese characters. While characters are hard, they're absolutely vital to learning Chinese. You can't really teach Chinese using pinyin."
3,you can do better,"When I started purchasing these resources I was an absolute begginner of Chinese. I got on to Amazon.com and ordered practically every well rated resource. This particular one has some good information in it, but for a beginner it goes way too fast. I found the tapes to be useless. FOr the absolute beginner very intent upon learning chinese I would recommed ""a modern course in Chinese"" THe tapes that come with it are invaluable. But if you just want a good book, then get Beginner's chinese, by Yong Ho. THough as an extra resource it does have allot of good information."
3,a good book for beginner,"I have been teaching Mandarin using this book for two years, my impression is that this book has quite comphrensive introduction of Mandarin and explaination goes into very details, which sometimes may cause confusion. The book is written a few years ago, and some of the content is out of date or not accurate,one more thing is it is difficult for a student to learn it by himself as the text becomes difficult very quick."
3,Nuge is Nuge,"A mediocre album by Teddy standards, State of Shock more or less serves up another helping of Ted in mandatory fashion. Paralyzed is the most recognizable track on the album, but it does have some other lesser known tunes worth a listen. The guitar solo in Alone is pretty choice. If you like Ted period, I'd have this one."
1,Broke next day,This chuck looked good when it arrived. The first day it had issues holding the bit in place. Would keep coming out all the time. Next day the chuck broke - I can't loosen it up anymore. Returning...
3,not completely pleased,"After trying to use the conversion chuck, it seems to work fine when screwing ""in"", but reverse seems to unlock the chuck and releases the attachment from the chuck. Can you advise me on the problem?Ken"
5,DEWALT Quick Connect Impact Driver Chuck,This is a very functional product. Excellent grip on drill bits and reliable release. I have no binding or locking up which has been a great frustration with keyless chucks from other manufacturers. Recommended!
1,Won't hold the bit,"I used this over the weekend on a project that required a lot of drilling. I could not get the chuck to tighten. Holding the collar while pressing the trigger caused the chuck to slip, regardless of what I tried to do (push/pull the collar while tightening, etc.). I finally put it in my steel desk vice, got channelock pliers and stuck an old screwdriver in the collar hole (looks like where a chuck key should go, but the handle on my chuck key wouldn't fit). I tightened it alright, it worked great until I wanted to change bits and it took me 10 minutes to reverse my tightening using the same vice and pliers. Afterword, same story, it would not tighten just would slip constantly. Am sending it back and trying the Makita chuck.P.S. I have DeWalt cordless hammerdrill and impact driver and love their products, have had several generations of their products with no problems, but this one chuck is a disappointment."
1,It broke with very little use.,I would say to buy another brand for mine broke with very little use after the warranty expired.I thought I would give Dewalt another chance since this is made in the USA. Usually I buy Makita or Milwaukee but save your money on this chuck unless you have money to burn!
4,Very Good.,This is the one I've been expecting. I usually need it in my work. I also recommend it to some of my co-worker
5,Save money if you have an impact drive,"Just lost 2 Dewalt hammer drills. One due to age and the other was accidentally dropped from a two story building. Bought $19 3/8 inch chuck drill from Harbor Freight only to find out that you get what you pay for so I bought if conversion chuck for my impact drive. Works on centifugal force and the speed at which you can change the drill is great. For the weekend warrior, ie, non commercial use, it converts the impact to a 3/8 chuck drill as depicted in the photo. This saves about $200 for me and I am very happy with it construction. I am glad the Dewalt folks are keeping up with the times."
5,Great for what its made for...,"The chuck works very well, releases and grabs bits perfectly... that is if you are using a real impact driver like me. The chuck is VERY sturdy and will last a long time if properly used.IT IS ONLY DESIGNED FOR IMPACT DRIVERS AND REQUIRES TOO MUCH TORQUE TO WORK WITH AN ELECTRIC SCREWDRIVER!"
1,Phillips bit is Still Stuck,The first use was great. It did everything I wanted by an impact driver. However I have never been able to remove the phillips bit from the chuck. I thought perhaps I shouldn't have used a such a bit. There weren't any instructions included to find out if I was in error. I'm happy the chuck failure wasn't due to my ignorance but rather a faulty design.I would not recommend this product unless you have only one bit you wish to use in your impact driver. It might become expensive to have a chuck for each bit youuse.
3,Solidly made but frustrating,"This tool seems great at first glance. I used it one time with my Makita impact driver and a small 1/8"" carbide bit to drill some holes in a cinderblock wall. It performed great the bit never slipped at all. BUT after I finished I could not get the chuck to let go of the bit. I beat on it with a hammer used vice grips threw it against the concrete all for nothing! This thing would not release the bit! Well I had the strangest idea today; ""maybe if i put the chuch in the impact driver and run it in reverse while holding the chuck."" Well it worked I only had to hold it for about a minute before the chuck finally gave up and let go. If i ever buy another one I'll go for the Milwaukee with the keyed chuck this thing was just too frustrating!"
3,DEWALT DW0521 QUICK CONNECT IMPACT DRIER CONVERSION CHUCK,"I WOULD NOT REPURCHASE THIS PRODUCT. I REALLY DO NOT HAVE MUCH USE FOR THIS PRODUCT AND I THINK THAT I CAN SPEAK FOR MOST OF US. YOU HAVE TO BE CAREFUL NOT TO DAMAGE YOUR DRILL WHEN USING THIS PRODUCT. YOU HAVE TO FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS CAREFULLY OR YOU WILL. I SUGGEST THAT YOU TIGHTEN OR LOOSEN THE CHUCK TO REMOVE BITS, WHEN IT IS NOT ATTACHED TO THE DRILL TO AVOID DAMAGE TO YOUR DRILL. IT IS HEAVY AND CUMBERSOME. I KNOW WE ALL OWN A DRILL THAT CAN HANDLE ALL BITS, USE THAT ONE WHEN NEEDED. I WISH I DIDN'T SPEND THE MONEY ON THIS PRODUCT."
4,"Very cool and time saving, but not very intuitive to work with","This is a pretty cool device that allowed me to use my impact in ways that I didn't know possible. Very, very solid and very useful. Once I read the instructions it all went well... which leads me to the downside... You'll never get it to work properly until you read and figure out the instructions. I know, I know... it's as simple as reading them, but you must take into account two things: 1. Sometimes you have to lend someone your tools, and they'll need specific instructions to make it work (a time consuming task every now and then); and, 2. For those of us who are used to other DeWalt's tools (like the DCD950 drill/driver), this conversion chuck can be awkward to work with, specially when you switch between tools.I read someone couldn't make it work, so I guess there are people trying to use the tool without reading instructions first ;)"
4,delivered...,product arrived quickly and as describe. still waiting for all those lines to dissappear! ;)
2,Charlotte's Web,"The DVD at times has no audio, and at other times it does. Sometimes the audio comes on after the movie has begun, at other times at the beginning, or not at all."
3,Old version,"I love the book but I had already seen the newer version and therefore I didn't enjoy reading this particular older version...the layout is less interesting and puts you off reading it. Go for the newer version, it's so much better and the graphics make it a very interesting read."
5,Great for kids!,"I had one of these when I was a teenager, loved it! I bought two for my daughter's room for her and guests. Chairs by day, beds by night! Can only be spot cleaned, so I wouldn't get this for younger children that tend to spill."
2,The Last Grievance,This was a very disappointing book by this author. I liked Family Man so much but haven't found any of her other books that compare to it. I based my purchase on the number of stars that Amazon rated it and it fell short in my opinion.
2,My Latest Disappointment,"The write-up for this book was better than the book itself. I wanted to find a book for my book club-something fresh, and entertaining. I found this book to be less."
5,Thoroughly Enjoyable and Charming,"My only disappointment in the book was that it ended all too quickly, ending my association with the characters. I've loved all Elinor Lipman's books and this one was totally charming.The characters seemed like people we've met or know, the setting a place like one we've visited and events that aren't totally unusual - but written in such a totally unique way that it not only held my interest, but I couldn't read fast enough. I just loved the ""voice"" of the central character, Frederica, and the relationship with her parents.This book reminded me that however entertaining and easy the Chick Lit genre may be, there is no substitute for a well written, intelligent book like those written by Elinor Lipman."
4,Enjoyable,"I really enjoyed the way this author wrote. Interesting, creative, and original! I thought the ""story"" was a bit silly at times but still appreciated the characters and the originality of the book."
4,Unique,"This book gets 4 stars for being so unique. It is slightly cliched, but I didn't mind. Overall, it was worth my time, and I am looking forward to reading more books from this author."
3,"The selection is great, however.....","While the editor has done a very credible job of selecting examples of submarine stories, each book is represented by a relatively short excerpt (usually a single chapter). The potential reader must consider that he/she may have their appetite whetted for a particular book or books, but it will then be necessary to seek out a copy of those should there be a desire to read more. Such classics as ""The Boat"" (The basis for the movie ""Das Boot""), Beach's ""Run Silent, Run Deep"", ""The Hunt for Red October"", and Calvert's ""Silent Running"" are presented, but the reader should recognize that these are excerpts, and not full-length stories nor condensations."
1,The Greatest Submarine Stories Ever Told: Dive! Dive! Fourteen Unforgettable Stories from the Deep,"On a scale of 1 to 10 this book would be -5. Very very poorly written.Author did not condense stories effectively. Critical events ended without some indication of the outcome. I have read many of the books retold in this book and the authors work is totally inadequate. I have returned the book for refund. Your policies are out standing. The book is really bad. I have about 125 submarine books, I served on 2 old boats in the late 50's. The authors work is a great disservice to those who risked (and many lost) their lives in service to our nation. Thank you."
3,Different format,"This book was different style than I was used to see, it is mostly based on sections of the body rather than body systems. I guess each style has its own benefits but in this one I missed systems view. You can't see circulation, endocrine, lymph drain.Case studies were instructive, picture quality is not that great"
2,Not for me,I ordered this for myself and was disappointed with it. I did not notice any discernible differences in my health/diet routine. Would not purchase again.
3,Probably more for a brainy kid,"The concepts in this DVD are far too advanced for a baby. The film covers subjects such as tempo, rhythm, genres of music, etc., and there is a large amount of narration. For educational purposes, it would probably work best for children ages 3 and up. This is not to say a baby will not take interest in the sounds and images; my one year old enjoyed many sections of the video simply because she likes music and likes watching other children. Other portions were unable to hold her interest, however, and the information was certainly beyond her grasp."
5,One of the best Brainy Baby DVD's,"Watched it for the first time yesterday with my 2 year old grandson, and we both enjoyed watching the whole video. We're huge fans of this series."
5,Excellent DVD,"This DVD is great, the songs are very entertaining for kids and adults too. Highly recommend especially if child is a Laurie Berkner Fan."
4,Daughter loves dancing to Dinosaurs,My daughter loves these songs - if we start singing the Dinosaur song she immediately looks at the TV to see if the video is on. I like the songs because they aren't the same old kids songs that make me want to pull my hair out. The videos are fun and full of singing and dancing kids - which our nine month old loves to watch.
5,As far as kid music goes...,"My kids (age 5 & 2) love, love, LOVE this DVD and the companion CD as well. And as far as kid music goes, it's pretty good. Good music paired with catchy lyrics. Of course, after watching it six or seven times you'll be singing Victor Vito in your sleep. Still, it's a refreshing change of pace from the Wiggles. The sparse set allows the kids to focus on the music and dance and really gets them up and moving. I wish she had more DVDs, but for now we'll settle for buying more of her music CDs."
5,Only wished it was longer,"Just like Laurie Berkner, this video is incredible. At first I thought my daughter wouldn't like it because some of the songs weren't exactly like the Noggin videos or her CDs. She didn't mind at all. We watch this at least once a day and it always gets her up and dancing. You can tell Laurie genuinely enjoys children and they genuinely enjoy her. She, and her band, are a delight to watch again and again and again and again....."
3,Good but not what I expected,I expected there to be a lot more on this it. Overall for a three year old this was a good buy but I didn't like it. I guess of course that is why this movie is for a three year old.
2,"Fun Songs, TERRIBLE Sound!","Laurie Berkner's songs are catchy and fun. But what's the deal with the hideous audio recording? She sounds like she's singing in a tunnel 5 miles away! Tell me I just got a bad disc or something!! I saw Laurie on the Today Show and ordered her new DVD the same day, but the quality is sooo bad that I can't believe anyone would put this on the shelf to sell! What gives?"
2,"Good product, S-L-O-W shiiping!!!",Daughter loves the DVD but Amazon took one month to deliver. That's unsatisfactory and I would have purchased elsewhere had I known.
1,Neve showed up,I was very disappointed. After waiting a month it never arrived. I had to cancel the order and purchase it on my own.
5,Laurie Berkner Band,"I love this trio! I first saw them on Noggin. I recommend anything by them. A sure way to get your child(ren) up and dancing for awhile. They are fun and colorful. My kids liked all the kids in the videos. The music is silly and fun, easy to learn and sing along."
4,Kids love it,"I bought this for my three year old. He runs around singing the songs and does the movements, too. Surprisingly, my seven year old also likes it. Neither complain about it being played too long. They watch it in the car, which is better than the movies they watch. At least they are interacting. The only loser on the DVD is the guy who sings poorly. He did a remake of an old song that isn't very catchy. He could have picked a different one for the kids. Laurie's voice is crystal clear so there is no guessing what she is singing. Makes it easy for the kids to learn her songs."
5,Wish she had more DVD's,We've had this DVD for several months now and for the past 2 my daughter has watched it at least once every day. The songs are cute and fun to sing along to. I only wish she had more DVD's of her songs!
5,Laurie Berkner is the best,"What is it about Laurie Berkner that renders babies nearly catatonic? My son used to be quite the crier and her songs always calmed him down, at least for a little while. Now I have my second child, a baby girl, who also seems to be hypnotized by this woman's music. I have this CD but I just ordered another one with more songs on it."
4,High energy,"This DVD is one of the few that actually gets my 3 year old up and moving while it is on. He loves to run to ""I'm gonna catch you"" or throw a beach ball around to ""Under a Shady Tree"". The cinematography is pretty basic but he doesn't seem to notice."
5,Great kids music,My kids love the CD and the DVD with the quirky music videos. It may not be exactly like the videos seen on Noggin but still entertaining. My kids sing and dance along.
5,GREAT GREAT GREAT!,My son and I both LOVED this DVD. They were able to keep the interest of him and me from the start to the finish. It is a great family time fun DVD that everyone can enjoy and interact with.
5,Fun Entertainment...for a [...] and a [...],"Both of my children LOVE this DVD...my [...] loves Jack's Big Music Show and would squeal every time the Laurie Berkner Band came on, so I bought the CD for my car. It worked like a charm! He immediately stops crying the moment I turn on the CD, SO I had to go out and purchase the DVD as well. As suspected - the DVD entertains him at home and in the car. He loves to dance, squeal and laugh while watching it. My [...] loves it too. She has memorized all of the songs and dances with the music, which makes my [...] laugh even more.You will find yourself singing and dancing to these silly, but catchy tunes! I HIGHLY recommend the DVD, as well as, the CD!"
5,Laurie is da bomb,We love the energy they put into their videos. Great DVD & would love to see more from the band!!
5,My daughter loves this DVD!!,"We first saw The Laurie Berkner Band on NickJr with their video ""Family"". My daughter just loved that song so I looked for a dvd and came across this one. This DVD arrived quickly and we were excited to watch it. We have had for about two weeks and my two year old just loves all the songs. Her favorite is Along the River. She sings them the best she can. It is so cute. I am so glad I purchased this DVD and hope she will come out with more dvd's in the future especially with the Family song."
3,"Fun music, boring videos","My preschooler loves Laurie Berkner's music and the videos on Noggin and Jack's Big Music Show are great. But the videos on this collection are really boring. Just the three in the band with occasional kids here and there--very boring sets, etc. I'd recommend skipping the video and just buying the music cd (this one also came with a music cd, so that is a nice bonus). If you want fun videos, buy a DVD collection of Jacks' Big Music Show."
1,Oh brother,Her free music videos on Noggin are so much better. Cheap sets. No surprises. Save your money!
4,LukesMom,We LOVE Laure Berkner! She is clever and catchy and not annoying. It is one of my sons musical choices that I don't get sick of. My only gripe about this DVD is that it is rather short. I was expecting more songs and a longer video.
5,We love...The Laurie Berkner Band,Awesome! Just as engaging as the spots on Noggin. The whole family seems to enjoy it.
5,Great DVD...fun for the whole family,"My daughter LOVES this DVD....I ordered this for my 2 year old daughter for Christmas. I had seen this band on TV and thought the songs were catchy. What I didn't expect was how much the whole family would like the songs. They are fun,upbeat and very original(not annoying like some kids songs) She mimicks everything they are doing on the screen. It's great exercise and we have a blast dancing around the living room. She brings me the remote control every night after dinner so we can watch this DVD. I highly reccommend this to everyone who has kids that love to sing and dance."
4,We are . . . The Laurie Berkner Band,"Absolutely FANTASTIC! My 18 month old is a music nut! She absolutely loves music and loves watching the Jack's Big Music Show videos on Noggin. For any kid who loves music this is the perfect gift because it has been the only thing that keeps my daughter attention span! I HIGHLY recommend the DVD, because it is upbeat and the music is catchy. There isn't a day that does go by where my daughter is running up to the DVD player and pressing buttons wanting to turn on the video. I have finally had a chance to catch up on the laundry since finding this DVD! PERFECT!"
5,Best Kid Music HANDS DOWN!,We have all of Laurie's CD's...and the VHS tape..and now we have the DVD....AMEN!!Ms Berkner is an amazing talent....YOU MUST get this DVD..!!Enjoy
