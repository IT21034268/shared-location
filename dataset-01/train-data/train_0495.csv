3,Disappointed,Because the title was The Complete Gramercy Five Sessions I was disappointed that a tune titled Dig dees' Blues was not included. My original 45 was broken and I am still searching. Some radio stations used it as a lead-in back in the early fifties.Thank youPaul
1,Poorly engineered... shame on Minn Kota,"I purchased this quick release for my boat and ne Minn Kota Power Drive because of Minn Kotas great reputation. This item never made it passed my living room before I decided to ship it back to Amazon. The directions from Minn Kota were poorly written and I was trying to figure out what was the front or back side before I mounted it on my boat. I put the cover on the base and it would only go on in one direction by design. It went together hard and tightly as if it did not belong together. Okay once together, the cover would not come off the base when I released the quick release lever! I had to pry it apart with tools from underneath the base. If I had bolted the base to the boat, I would have not been able to realease the cover and would have to remove the nuts from the bolts and then remove the entire base. This is a badly engineered item from Minn Kota. I returned this item and used a different quick release from Minn Kota."
2,Messy & not what I expected.,"I have used a Sonicare that has the liquid toothpaste for about 6 or 8 years. It replaced another brand. I love it!! T has really improved my teeth and my visits to the dentist.This new one is really messy. I squirts toothpaste drops every where. Also, the plastic on the back of the brush hits your teeth and is not very comfortable.I am going to buy the Elite 9500 to replace it for my second bathroom."
5,Dentist recommended,Since I have been using my Sonicare brush my gums have improved 100% and my smile is wide and white.
4,Good Product,"We've used Sonicare since our dentist recommended the product in the '90s and are on our third. The first two paused every 30 seconds so you'd know when to move to another quad, the latest more expensive version, not the top of their line, though, just runs without the 30-second alerts. And, of course, they'd rather you paid for a new one rather than change batteries. I imagine the top models have the 30-second feature, but I'm not about to pay double the price. Just have to suffer, I guess. Would rank five stars if battery was replaceable."
4,"Sonicare, great product, this version has missing features",I bought Sonicare for the first time 4 years ago and I loved it. When it stopped working I bought the one listed here. I did not realize this model did not come with the '30 second' notifications. My old Sonicare beeped every 30 seconds to remind me to switch brushing areas. Now I am guessing. It's just easier to let the beeps tell you than guess how much is enough. Maybe I should buy a stopwatch? jk.
4,toothbrush without beep!,"I bought this toothbrush as a replacement for another Sonicare brush I had for years. Just like the old one, this one runs for 2 minutes. I like this one but I wish it had the 30 second ""beep"" as the other one did."
3,Not as advertised,"I have been using the Sonicare electric toothbrush for years now. I recently decided to buy a new one as the old one was beginning to show signs of wear.The brush is advertised as having four (4) 30 second stages (two minutes total) in the brushing action so you know how long to brush the top, front and back, and the bottom row, front and back. There is supposed to be a fraction of a second stop action built into the product. The product I received does not have that feature built in.Since I have been using Sonicare for so many years, the 30 second timing is so part of my memory that I decided I didn't need the toothbrush to ""tell"" me when it was time to switch to another row of teeth. So I decided to keep the brush.However, this is definitely a defect in the brush I received."
4,You know that urban legend where...,"... some people get their home burglarized and then develop a roll of film that shows their toothbrushes in a burglar's butt? You wouldn't do that with this toothbrush if it was on. It vibrates like crazy. And who uses rolls of film anymore?I have had this product since August 6th (according to the email from Amazon I just discovered in my spam folder which suggested that I review the toothbrush) and I have the same number of teeth that I did when I purchased it. This is optimal in a toothbrush. Superficially, ""more teeth"" sounds more positive, but we all know that technically shouldn't happen. Unless I was under 13 or something. But I'm not and I am about to tick a box promising that."
2,This Sonicare not like previous model,"This model, which replaces the Advance 4000, does not have the essential pause feature to signal quadrant change in the 2-minute cycle. I sent it back to Phillips when they wouldn't replace it with a model that does."
2,whoops I bought the wrong one!,I bought this electric toothbrush to replace my six or seven year old Sonicare which I thought was broken (it turns out I just had a faulty outlet in my bathroom). The thing I DO NOT LIKE about this particular model is that it doesn't let me know every 30 seconds when it's time to move to another part of my mouth (like my old one does). My advice --- get the one that gives you this helpful little signal AND check your electrical supply before you replace a perfectly good (SEVEN year old!) appliance!
1,Bad product or bad luck,I bought this toothbrush a year ago. It has been good except it needs frequent charging. Now it is dead.
3,Replacement battery,"I have been using a Sonicare toothbrush for years. What I was looking for was a replacement battery that would fit my old charger stand. With this in mind I took the least expensive unit I could find, which does not include the time feature = this is extra. I will look for another way to solve my problem next time."
4,Gets the job done,"This toothbrush gets your teeth clean, and I have noticed that it does better than my previous oral b toothbrush at removing stains. I drink a lot of coffee and at every dental visit my teeth would have a lot of staining.This doesn't have things like battery indicator levels, and doesn't buzz every 30 seconds like my previous one did making my timing off. However, the price was right compared to the newer more expensive models."
4,Pretty good,"I got this as a christmas present a couple years ago. It works pretty well. I switched from a regular toothbrush to this and you definitely notice a difference. I don't know about getting my teeth whiter but my teeth, in general, feel cleaner. The only complaint I have is that the brush head is kinda large, the bristles a little too soft for my taste, and the shaft is short so it can be to clean my back teeth (I think my mouth is a little smaller than average too and that might be a reason as well). The crossaction regular toothbrush that I switched from worked better in that respect. I'm thinking about trying the compact replacement heads to see if that helps."
1,Mine Broke Shortly After I got it,"I used my sonicare toothbrush for about 2 weeks then it just stopped working for no reason. I tried to call sonicare but have yet to get through because everytime I call I have to wait to speak to someone. It was fine while it worked but I am a bit annoyed that I recieved a defective product, and I wonder if my situation is rare or happens often."
1,2 months life,"I agree with a few of the previous reviews that it works well, but don't expect it to last. My last one lasted a little less than 2 months. It is a very poorly made product. If you take steps (i.e. using tape for waterproofing to supplement for poor construction and completely drying the unit off and charger off after every use) you may be able to get a longer life out of it. I am looking for a better unit as I love the performance of an electric toothbrush. I am done with sonicare though. Also, they don't back up their product. I have contacted them several time to no avail."
5,No frills & solid performance,"This is my 2nd Sonicare 4100. My other one lastest for 10 yrs., until it would finally decide to turn on by itself. Can't complain for the amount of use it got, 4 family members for 10 yrs.! I decided to go with another 4100 because it is a solid performer. I decided against getting a newer model Sonicare, as it seems all they did was add frills to spruce up an already great power toothbrush and raise the price as well. I am just thankful they still offer the Sonicare 4100, as it does exactly what they originally designed it to do, clean teeth remarkable well, and provide a power toothbrush that lasts!"
1,This Toothbrush Literally Fell Apart,"At first, this product was great. I loved how clean my teeth felt afterwords. But after a few short months of owning it, I can't get it to charge anymore, and the entire casing is cracked up the front of the toothbrush. The detachable tooth brush part has cracked up so bad it barely even attaches to this toothbrush anymore.This toothbrush was a complete waste of my money, and now I have to buy a new one. I certainly won't be buying another Philips."
2,Wrong product sent,"I ordered the Sonicare 4100, the old model, because I have used one for six or seven years and loved it and I know that the new models (the ones with the skinny neck) are not as good (for me anyway) because they are very rough and noisy whereas the 4100 is very gentle and quiet. Unfortunately what I received was a 7000 series model. I no longer have the packaging so I can't even return it. I am very disappointed."
1,This is a disposable toothbrush,"I was surprise to discovered all Sonicare toothbrushes are disposable item. Its battery cannot be replace what so ever. Like any other electronic products, its battery and IC board are toxic and can only be dispose by your local electronic waste program. Mine lasted about 6 months, at this rate...we're going to end up tones of these in our landfill. It is airresponsible to produce products like this. If I had known about this I would never have bought it.Forget about this hi-tech marketing stuff. Use a regular toothbrush and get your teeth clean regularly is the best prevention."
1,Sonicare Toothbrush delivery,I ordered this toothbrush close to 2 weeks ago and I have not received it yet. The info read that they would ship within 1 to 2 business days.I am very disappointed!
1,Never received item,"Amazon did not send the item to the zip code they had in their database...item went to the wrong address and was refused.I was not notified until the order was cancelled, and was told I could reorder.The free shipping and discount for new Amazon credit card was not honored, so I did not reorder. Disappointing."
4,Economy electric brush,"Gets the job done! You probably already know how to brush your teeth, so why worry about timers and beeping and such. The unit turns off after two minutes, and that's good enough. No fancy angled head, and the battery is good for two weeks (brand new) so you can take it on vacation. The power button can be a little hard for children to press, but this could be a good OR bad thing."
5,THIS IS A GREAT TOOTH BRUSH !,If you have receding gum's or just want the cleanest mouth in town this is it!To the person above my brush went out after 3 year's so i called sonic care toll free and they sent me a new one i did copay on it but they where very fair! As for the people thinking the replacement brushes are a little spendy they are more then just the brush as they have the magnet part in it also and they usually have a two pack on sell for under 19 dollar's. As far as the vibration when you start using it may take a week to get use to it and yes close your mouth or you will have tooth paste flying all over ! WILL NEVER GO BACK TO ANY THING ELSE My dentist check up's have been great and my gum's are healthy! 5 STAR PRODUCT! BUY ONE!
2,It died after one year - ?,"i loved -LOVED - my sonicare for about 12 months or so - i knew better than to leave it on the charger, it would last a good 10 days and then about a week and then suddenly it only last 2 days. then seemingly overnight it didnt last even one brushing session! I let it die and recharged, I left it on the charger, i tried anything and everything to get it back to at least doing a full brushing - nothing. I'm been trying for a few weeks now and am giving up. I've read the steps people have taken to open it, cut thru the packing and sealants to change the batteries, and then re-seal - it seems a lot of effort for something that should bloody WORK after only one year!VERY DISAPPOINTING."
3,just okay,Stays charged for a long time. Didn't clean teeth quite as well as hoped. Messy to use when mouth is open to clean front teeth etc. Heads were small - new heads are expensive and not sure if they are bigger or not until purchase and use them. Hope it will last a long time for the price paid!
5,excellent,"I consider myself to be enough of a minimalist that the idea of an electric toothbrush seemed excessive to me. When my friend raved about hers (she has used hers for 5 or 6 years now) she said that it changed her life. I gave it a shot, and it took about a week or two before it didn't feel really weird but now I absolutely love it. On the occasions that I use a regular toothbrush my teeth simply don't feel clean like they do when I use my sonicare. I love this toothbrush and and feel it is well worth the investment."
3,Decent product,"I don't know if I entirely buy their claims about whitening and such, but it does a decent job of keeping my teeth clean in-between regular dental cleanings. Definitely better than a manual toothbrush."
4,a new kind of brushing,"This new tooth brush takes a little getting used to, but it does a great job of cleaning your teeth even tho the sensation is a bit different. you'll not go back to the old brush again!"
5,Gret toothbrush but severely over-priced.,"I bought a used Advance toothbrush. I got some new brushheads for it, charged it up and it has worked extremely well now for several years.When it dies, I will replace the Ni Cad batteries in it and use it as I have - letting the thing run until it needs to be recharged.It's still possible to get Advance brushheads. Sometimes, a generic one may be the only one available.Sonicare should resurrect the Advance Model. The Amazon price for a new one is, frankly, absurd."
4,Sonicare: A must have for proper oral care,"First off, the Sonicare absolutely helps enormously with keeping tartar at bay. I always get gold or platinum stars from my hygienist. Of course, I floss daily, as well.The first Sonicare I ever bought lasted exactly one year before it died. I was pretty disappointed and didn't buy another until a few years later. I did not keep the handle on the charger and it usually sat in the shower unless it needed charging.The second Sonicare finally died on me recently. It lasted seven years and through two deployments to Iraq! I always stored the handle on the charger and never let it discharge. I can't explain it's longevity; it simply goes against common rechargeable battery protocol.I'm currently shopping for another Sonicare. I will buy the cheapest model I can find since I know it will clean my teeth as well or better than an expensive model."
4,"Good product, good price",A basic Sonicare at a good price - it gets the job done. Just had a dental check up and the gums and teeth are in good shape despite not flossing.
4,"I replaced my electric toothbrush, loved my old one of eight years.","Wanted the same excellent product, obviously one changes the brushes regularly, but the electric part lasts for a long time."
3,Worked For A Short Time,I bought 2 Sonicare brushes approximately 2 1/2 years ago. They worked great but one of them decided to not hold a charge. I am quite disappointed as I thought I could just replace the battery. I paid almost $90.00 and did not get the life expectancy I thought I would.
1,Junk,"The Philips sonicare advance series is a piece of junk. On my first purchaseI noticed that the replacement heads never lasted the six months they aresupposed to last, cracked in less than 3 months.When the handle cracked (after about 18 months) I bought another.The new one,the handle cracked within 3 months, and lasted less than a year.the heads cracked and did not last even remotely close to the6 months they are supposed to. I've tried this brush twice,I'm throughwasting my money, I'm going to Oral B (Braun)"
4,Teeth Love It,"My old one quit working after 5 years, so I wanted the same model since using it cut cavities down to zero and eliminated any gum pain. Easy to use and well worth the price! Replacement heads slightly pricey, but look for sales."
3,"A great toothbrush, but battery is non-replaceable, and battery life too short","I would give this toothbrush a 5 star for its function, but I can only give it a 3 star given the short usable life.This toothbrush worked great for 2.5 years, then the battery started dying. Since the battery is non-replaceable, the whole thing has to be thrown away. This is a major disappointment to me considering how much it would cost to replace the battery, and how much it costs to buy a new toothbrush.I did follow all precautions for taking care of the NiCd battery by draining all charges before recharging which is normally once a week.I would either unwillingly buy a new one or find a competing product whith replaceable batteries."
3,Nice product with no 30 sec timer,I gave it 3 stars because the 30 sec timer does not work. But the product works otherwise.
5,Great toothbrush,"I ordered a new Sonicare toothbrush to replace my old Sonicare that gave up the ghost after 11 years. It came in the stated time, arrived in great condition and I'm still enjoying using a Sonicare."
3,Expensive disposable product,"Sonicare is a great product, too bad the brushes cost almost half the cost of the product and there is no replacement battery. When the battery stops charging you throw away one expensive toothbrush."
3,it's okay...,"I've had a sonicare for 5 years and really liked how it worked before it finally died and I was unable to change the battery because it was too hard to pry the handle apart without breaking it so I was forced to buy another one... I bought this one because it's cheaper than the other ones. The only disadvantage is that this model doesn't prompt you to change brushing zones every 30 seconds like the more expensive ones do, which can be a bit annoying if you don't have a clock next to your sink. Otherwise, it does the same job as my older model. It all comes down to if you want that 30-second prompt, paying up to 20 more bucks or not."
4,Sonicare 4100 Power Toothbrush Review,"This is my second Sonicare power toothbrush and I miss the 30 second beeping to let me know when to move to the next quadrant of my mouth. This one does give the 2 minute beep, but you have to know when to move to another area.Do NOT leave the handle out of the charger very long because the charge does not come back. If you leave it plugged in all the time, then you have no problem."
3,Not Exactly the Same,"I purchased the closest Sonicare model to the one I had which died after 5 years of use. Unfortunately, this model does not have the 30 second pacer, which I really loved with my original one. It may have been a good time for me to upgrade to the newer model, but I had just purchased two packages of the replacement heads that went with my original model. As the replacement heads are not inexpensive, I bought the same model in order to use them. Next time, I'll read the product features more carefully before ordering!"
5,Great upgrade,"I purchased this toothbrush a few months ago and am extremely pleased with my purchase. It took a week or two for me to get used to brushing with this new brush, but once I did its been great. My teeth feel like I just got back from the dentist when I finish brushing. Also, one charge lasts 2 week easily for this brush. I would highly recommend this brush for anyone in the market for new one."
4,Great Value on sonicare 4100,"My sonicare 4100 died after 3 years use, so I needed to replaceit. Went to drug and discount stores and the best price I saw was$99 to $119 for sonicare toothbrushes. Checked Amazon and got a great price and it was here in three days.Philips Sonicare Advance 4100 Sonic Power Toothbrush"
5,My old sonicare toothbrush finally died,"I wanted to replace my old sonicare toothbrush, since I had unused brush heads which do not fit the newer models available in stores near me. I was worried about quality, as the price was lower than I had paid for the one that died, but the quality is great.I had the old sonicare for several years. These toothbrushes are very high quality, the built-in timer is helpful, and I recommend it. Before moving up to the sonicare, I used Braun, but the sonicare is definitely better."
4,Great Brush at a great price,"This toothbrush is great. I instantly noticed my teeth being less ""gunky"" after using this it.It takes some getting used to, versus a standard brush; if you don't keep your lips sealed while brushing, it splatters toothpaste all over."
4,Worth every penny... but is sure is messy.,"This sonicare 4100 is the first electric toothbrush I've owned. I waited 2 years to buy one ( it's so hard to justify a $70.00 toothbrush, and I wish I'd gotten it sooner.I like the two minute cut off timing...I don't have to clock watch or pay attention to anything else while I'm brushing. I usually do 2 minutes on the top teeth and then two minutes on the bottom teeth, and I just love the way my teeth feel when I'm done.The only negative I've run across is that this is one seriously messy process. Make sure the toothbrush is turned off before taking it out of your mouth."
5,A must-have for better oral hygiene!,"The sonicare toothbrush that I bought works exactly like the advertising says it does. It is easy to use, easy to take care of, and best of all it really does help keep your mouth cleaner. I noticed results right away and it helped get rid of my dental problems like sore, bleeding gums (gingivitis). I would recommend this product to everyone."
1,major mold and stopped working,"i had sonicaire complete. Mold builds up horribly inside. Take it apart weekly and dry it. Still gets mold. Clean with bleach, carefully clean it so as not to get water inside, still gets mold (wifes too). Finally after about 8 months or so mine stopped working. it just lets out a weak little buzz. This was my second Sonicaire device. Last ones dies too. Don't think their made in Germany anymore."
3,Sonicare Advance 4100S Power Toothbrush,"The power toothbrush is a great product. Incase you can't stand brushing your teeth for longer than 20 seconds, this toothbrush will keep you going for 2 minutes and then it shuts itself off. Take good care of your pearly whites and they will take care of your smile. I think think my dentist will be pleased and I may give my dental hygenist a break. She always whines about the amount of time she has to spend on cleaning. Yeah, no more whiny DH. So there."
4,Replacement purchase,Have used this product for years and was glad to fiind it as the local stores had more expensive replacements with more stuff than I needed.
5,Excellent for Motivation & Education,"I used segments of this video for Women's Studies and Critical Thinking college classes, but the whole video would be useful for any motivational or educational program with young people."
5,May You Always Have Pleasant Thoughts...,"What You Think is What You GetIt is similar to what Deepak Chopra, Wayne Dyer, etc. talk about but with a fresh new twist. I like the way the book is organized.We heard the author GEORGE LAVENIA recently and were very impressed with him. He is a testimonial to what he preaches.I wish that this recommendationm finds you having pleasant thoughts!Since What You Think is What You Get. :-)Peace...Ed of Aberdeen"
2,Wrong Letter,"I purchased the letter ""b"" but when I received the package, the ribbon was stapled on upside-down making the letter look like a ""p"". It looks great other than it being upside down. Because of the price, it is not worth sending back and waiting on another one. It would be less hassle to just fix it myself. This is a great product, but I suggest buying it in a store (I think Babies 'R Us sells them) to avoid receiving the wrong letter."
4,"Enlightening. Hot, yet cool.",I think it is one of his best solo albums. Deeply interesting. Good on long car trips. Has unusual moods. Brings together all realms of life into a succinct sonic package.
4,Peter Murphy or Bryan Ferry?,"'Holy Smoke' sounds like its cover looks with Murphy sounding a little more life weary, wise and yes older. The sound has matured and the number of upbeat tunes has decreased. The opener is my favorite on the album - that's usually a bad thing. ""Keep Me from Harm"" is one of the singer's most beautiful and truly romantic songs and displays a Bryan Ferry type quality in the high notes... I've never heard Peter go this high before without it being more of a shriek. ""Kill the Hate"" and ""The Sweetest Drop"" are easily accessible with the latter being the feature single - both have good beats and reasonably catchy refrains. That same description could be applied to ""Hit Song"" which was an import single. ""Let Me Love You"" is a Murphy style ballad but fails to achieve the lofty standards set by himself.'Holy Smoke' is a good album and fans should have it, but it would be an ill-advised place for a newcomers to start out. Get 'Deep' and 'Love Hysteria' and work from there."
1,A massive disappointment,"There's only one good song on this album, and Peter Murphy knew it. That's why he sarcastically titled it ""Hit Song"". The rest of the album is impenetrable, gawdawful noise. I suppose it's inevitable that the ten people who liked it would end up giving it positive reviews, but there's a reason why ""Holy Smoke"" basically killed Murphy's career. After Bauhaus and the PHENOMENAL ""Deep"" (which you should stop reading this review and buy, right now, immediately) it looked like Murphy was on his way to superstardom. ""Holy Smoke"" put a bullet in the head of all that, and Murphy has spent the 20 years since in virtual exile. It's almost as if Murphy was literally afraid of the success he was achieving, and felt like he had to do something to avoid stardom."
5,"gave Bowie a run for his money, I think","Expectations be damned; of the four Murphy albums I own, this is the best. This iswell rounded, romantic, and rockin'. As any consumate artist should, I think hewanted to showcase the totality of his talent, and not be ""typecast"" as a Goth rocker.We're so much better off for it. An underrated talent if there ever was one, anda terrific alternate to David Bowie--or Bryan Ferry--in the mature sex symbol crooner dept..Just very good from beginning to end."
2,Choppy,Not one of Peter's best. Seems very raw to me. Hard to listen to but I will keep on since it is Peter
4,Still great- but not his best,"As a longtime fan of the Murph who owns all the albums (bauhaus, Dali's Car, and solo), I have to admit that Holy Smoke would be my least favoured. It has, however, grown on me over the years. Mr. Murphy is a brilliant artist and poet who seemed to have lost some of his focus with this album. I believe high points of this work are Keep me from harm, with a gently lilting style sure to please, and the Sweetest Drop, a song that may be sexual or vampiric in nature, or maybe a little of both. As I said, this may not be his best album, but is well worth owning."
2,Peter's Junior Release Slump,"With every good intention Peter Murphy recorded his follow up to his break-through CD ""Deep"". It seems his intention was to make a sequel to Deep--while allowing himself to test new waters musically and vocally. Aside from the good ""deep""-era B-side quality of Keep Me From Harm and You're So Close..this CD has too many self-indulgent embarrsing moments (most notably Kill The Hate). Only for completists."
3,MURPHY TREADING WATER,"Much as I love his music, this is by no means Peter Murphy's best album. Keep Me From Harm begins like a Gregorian chant before settling down as a Bowiesque ballad. Kill The Hate is driven by a complex rhythmical pattern with wailing organ (or synthesizers) and You're So Close has some impressive soaring vocals and moody breaks. The Sweetest Drop is a conventional rock number whilst Let Me Love You is a sombre ballad and Our Secret Garden has a lighter, swaying rhythm. Hit Song was in fact a small hit for Murphy but I don't understand why, it's a fairly standard big ballad with a mildly engaging chorus. In my opinion the songs here lack great melodies and sounds too much the same. I recommend his anthology Wild Birds or albums like Should The World Fail To Fall Apart to enjoy the best work of this remarkable artist."
3,Y wing is a BIG winner,"This new Y wing is awesome! Comes already decaled, all you have to do is unstrap the figure and put him in the ship! very realistic-it would be nice if these new ships had some elctronics like the Falcon, but this is really nice! Seems durable but is an excellent display piece to! Well worth the money!"
1,not what was advertised,what i got in the mail was not what was advertised the cover was not the same and their were parts in the movie the were cut and that is not what i wanted. I though it was the viseo jems vhs and that is what the sealer advertised.
1,Historic Arrogance,"It is fascinating how every generation seems to think they know more about history than those who lived it. When people disbelieve the record of an historic event by those who were there when it happened, and proceed to build a history based on modern opinion, they do err. And to add insult to injury, these moderns love to present their edited versions of history as ""historic"" and scholarly.The record of Jesus of Nazareth is found in the New Testament, written for the most part by those who were there with Him. Those who do not like that record (hate the truth?) would be far more respectable if they would simply and honestly admit that they do not believe, instead of inventing endless non-historic versions.Honest seekers of the historic Jesus would do well to start with the New Testament of the Bible and then read the writings of scholars who remain true to the record.Nice try, Mr. Jennings, but your search seems to have led you and will lead many others astray from the truth."
4,Visually pleasing but the instructions lacked umph.,"I am a great craft book fan and looked forward to receiving this one. It is visually pleasing and even includes quite a bit of ephemera for the reader to use (must be photocopied and not cut because it is two-sided, but that's OK).My problem was that, with the exception of the intro where the reader is told to 'go to flea markets - and the one in Paris is great' none of the projects had any sourcing guidelines at all.I also found the instructions were quite bland - meaning they were numbered and typed without any step-by-step photographs - only pictures of the completed projects. Even the descriptions often left you wanting a little more.Overall - great book as a jumping off point for your imagination; I just wished she shared more techniques rather than a bevy of finished projects."
2,More like a pretty magazine...,"This book isn't worth the $ if you're a crafter looking for true inspiration. Sure, the projects are pretty but nothing we haven't seen before. Author does NOT go into details with the projects and I honestly was left wondering, ""Does she really want people making this stuff? Or is she just trying to get her name out there?""If you want a look at this book, get it at the library or flip through it at the book store. It's not worth buying at full price, however.I recommend Pretty Little Things by Sally Jean Alexander instead, and also browsing artful blogging blogs and tutorials! Those are better than this book!"
3,"Good book, but thin","I enjoyed this book, which I thought had some inspirational projects and ideas. I like Anna's style and didn't mind that the book includes no ""step-by-step"" instructions. I do think more photos could have been included (I noticed several duplications) as well as a CD containing the ephemera. A trend is developing now of including clip art in the final pages of craft books. In my opinion, if clip art is to be included, a CD (which costs only pennies to produce) containing the clip art images should also be included. Having to take a book apart to copy and resize pages is not a good thing. I won't be taking my book apart to copy it; so the purpose is defeated."
1,Do not buy,I purchased this thru my company account. The content is OK but the figures is horrible. Each time I read the book I feel so angry because I can't see a thing with all the blurry screen shots. I can't believe this is a professional publication and got the high reviews from some people (I depend on those reviews to buy this book anyway)
3,Mastering C# Database Programming,"I have purchased from Amazon before and find the purchasing experience has been very easy. It is the item I purchased that I have an issue with.I do not use the book I am refering to but I do the purchasing for some of our engineers.I was just approached with a complaint by one of these engineers that received this book. He asked me to write a review so the supplier will be aware of a problem he is having.The book has several reference pictures included in the pages and the instructions tell you to see the example and read what the example in the picture has to say.The reference pictures are so blurry and the typeing in the pictures is so small it is very hard to read and almost impossible to understand what it is trying to ref to. If he hadn't already highlighted some of the information in the book, I would probably try to return it."
3,"Lots of samples, but not much else","The author included lots of excerpts from different family histories - but didn't have much information about how to do the background research, how to organize your records or how to craft stories out of a pile of dates and other records. I didn't find the book particularly useful."
3,Somewhat Disappointed,"I am disapponted with this source. Having just finished a screenplay which I am now marketing, I was hoping to find scripts which had been made into movies so I could review those in my genre and decide which companies/ agencies/ agents were best to approach. Since only a few of the scripts in this book were made into movies, I have no way of comparing. I can't go out and buy every script in my genre to read. Also, the cross-referencing is weak. I am interested in romantic comedies. When I look at the cross-reference romantic comedy section, I find only the title and date of sale. I have to go back to the main directory to find any other information. I have to do this over and over again for each title I research. I am simply trying to find the names of companies which produce my type of film. It shouldn't be so difficult. In defense of the directory, I am learning the names of companies attached to certain projects."
5,Superb Lens,"Nikon 18-200mm f/3.5-5.6 G ED-IF AF-S VR DX Zoom-Nikkor LensIf could have only one lens for my Nikon DSLR this lens would be the one.I have read all the negatives (I always read the reviews from least to best) and must state that none apply to my lens.I have used the lens for several months now and am totally satisfied.The lens does not have any zoon creep but stays where I set it.I have checked my photos and find them to be sharp from center to edge.Now granted, I don't shoot a lot of test patterns but for everyday use, the 18-200mm Nikkor is a fabulous ""does nearly everything"" lens for my D90."
4,Nikon 18-200mm VR DX Zoom Lens,"A great product I had to shop around for, price wise anyhow. A little expensive but worth it in the long run. Has become the everyday lens wich is just fine with me cause that means less bulk to carry around. Don't be discouraged as I was at first with the zoom not being zoomable enough. It will capture what you want and transfers well in zoom printing. Pixels will take care of that. Would recommend quality wise and this site was the best site price wise without any hassles. Other sites might be cheaper at first but when you get through buying what they tell you you need it is no bergain. Buy the way you don't need to buy an expensive backup battery the one that comes with this is just fine. I recharge once a week and really have been using this to get aquainted with it quite often."
4,MUST OWN lens for walk-around lens & travel,"Clearly this is the best all-around, walk around and travel lens. This now always stays on my D70 camera (my other lens is the phenomenal 70-210 VR) when I am traveling. VR operation is delightfull; I tried both the 'normal' and 'active' VR modes to take the pictures of the famous hotels on the strip in Las Vegas at night (hand held and no tripod); and I took those pictures from a moving car. Yet, the pictures came out in stunning clarity and sharpness.Day light pictures as well came out very vivid and sharp (sharper than my older Nikon 24-120 VR).A minor annoyance has been the lens creep when pointed vertically down but it doesn't bother me much. And at 18mm, sometimes there is some distortion which doesn't bother me much as it is a minor percentage of the total shots I take."
5,This lens is GREAT!,"I take wedding photos for a living, and am always looking for ways of obtaining better images. I recently upgraded from the Nikon 24-85 zoom to the Nikon 18-200 VR lens. I had hopes that it would allow me to shoot at lower shutter speeds, in the dim lighting situations of Churches and receptions. I am amazed at how well this lens increases the overall number of good images. I recommend this product highly to anyone who wants to increase their zoom range and obtain better images in low light. If you use the Fuji S3 camera, as I do, be aware that there is an incompatibility with this lens that can be corrected by Fuji at no cost."
1,Shoddy workmanship,"When I bought this lens I noticed that it was made in Thailand. That should have been my first clue. Like all the ""newer"" Nikkors it is made with a lot of plastic. After one month of shooting (about 2000 actuations) on an assignment in Japan the zoom stopped working smoothly, then stopped working at all. It also will not stop up or down. I have a lot of other Nikkor lenses that are much more solidly made, but some of them can only be used in the manual mode on my digital cameras. I'm sending it to Nikon's repair facility tomorrow and we'll see what happens. Hopefully they will repair it quickly. It's more than annoying to spend almost $1000 on a lens that fails. This is the first Nikkor lens I have had in 26 years of shooting that has given me any sort of trouble. I guess I was do."
5,Very nice.,This lens is rela nice and to not have to switch back and forth from 18-55mm to 55mm-200mm is real nice. Kinda heavy. It is fast little louder than what I'm use to but not many of my lenses are this fast.
4,"So far, so good",Still new and still working on its capabilities. It's performed just fine. Good fit with camera and smooth enough movement.
3,Price is too high for what it really is.,"Laboratory study proves that this lens suffers a problem distortion problem. One such laboratory review is found also here:http://www.photozone.de/8Reviews/lenses/nikkor_18200_3556vr/index.htmDuring my visit to some professional photo stores in Europe, I came to learn that distortion is an issue with this lens.The anti-vibration is the biggest selling point for this lens but VR mode needs to be switched off when using tripoid."
5,This lens is good as it gets!!!,"When you die and go to heaven, if you where a kind hearted photographer with a great eye, St Peter gives you a Nikon D200 with this 18-200mm VR zoom. To get the most out of this lens the user needs to carefully learn its digital features as a part of the Nikon D200 system. This lens is much more that a zoom composition aid. It's worth attending a car, boat or horse race just to play with the image stabilization (VR) capabilities.If you were born rich or have worked way too hard in your life just buy one!!"
2,Too much of a compromise for me,"I really wanted to like this lens, it would have covered 95% of my usual work and the price was acceptable. Unfortunately it just doidn't produce the eye-poppingly sharp images which I expect from Nikon - it's why they get my business. It certainly allows you to get a wide range of pretty good photos quickly, with very little hassle, and if you are happy with 4 x 6 prints or images for the web, then this could be the perfect lens for you. For me, the results look soft much of the time and the distortion can be downright weird."
5,Very clear and fast!,"Received my Nikon 18-200mm VR lens yesterday and couldn't wait to try it. The first few pictures I could tell this is a quality lens as has been described in other reviews. It took about a month to receive it ,but was worth the wait. With my D200 this lens and my Sigma10-20mm and my Nikon 80-400mm I'm set for a lot of photography enjoyment. My personal likes are wildlife and scenes.If you want an all around lens this is the one!!!"
4,"Good Try, Half Cigar","Good lens, zoom a little louse, lens barrel drops down when camera points down, drops back when camera points up. Nikon very arrogant about fixing it, they have to be pushed into fixing it. Would be a much more useful lens if it was a ""D"" instead of a ""G"". Vibration Reduction ""VR"" best in the industry."
5,Great fl range for walking around lens,"I have 6 Nikon lenses in my bag, 4 more expensive than the 18-200mm. This one is on my D200 most of the time. Kudos again to Nikon."
3,frustrating,"I was so very excited about this lens and it was the first somewhat expensive lens i purchased for my DSLR. I liked the versatility and the VR feature - hoping to protect my sensor from dust with fewer lens changes. The problem? I am about to send it away for it's second repair!When first received it telescoped out badly, so that if, like me, you frequently photograph insects and flora at foot level - you loose your focus.That's not all, after only a month the lens froze up (would not zoom or focus - even in manual.) I sent if for repair, it worked alright for a while, then in the middle of my first paid photo job, it jammed up again. (Good thing I brought back ups.) If you haven't already purchased this, I would advise sticking with separate wide angle and telephoto lenses until Nikon improves this lens."
5,Outstanding lens but keep this in mind ...,"As of now, this lens is out of competition. Canon doesn't have 18-200 zoom offer and some other vendors don't match the Nikon quality and features.The lens is fast, quite, VR works great so this is an outstanding product without any doubts.A lot of people plan to use it as their primary day to day lens, but keep in mind, it feels pretty much as heavy as Nikon D50 camera itself. So if you plan to carry it casually for a day on your shoulder, it might be less enjoyable then you expect.Also, it's an expensive high quality glass, so you should consider keeping some high quality filter all the time as a protective measure.Overall - it's probably by far the best all purpose lens for Nikon DSLRs you can get in this price range. In fact, if you are trying to decide between Canon and Nikon low/mid range DSLR, that lens could be a crucial factor to go with Nikon D Series."
5,Great deal,"What more can I say about the venerable Nikon 18-200 F3.5-5.6 AF-S VR lens? Its a fantastic piece of hardware in a compact package. Perfect for traveling or just impromptu shoots in the field. Its not the fastest glass you can buy, but it does sink nicely into a compact day pack and can be easily tucked into a coat in case of a surprise shower. The super long zoom range makes it extremely versatile, I don't even carry the standard kit lens that came with my D70s anymore. The vibration reduction takes a little getting used to to fully make use of its capabilities but when you learn its tricks, it will become your friend when the light starts to fade.The accessories that Cameta Camera includes are great. The blower is powerful, the lens cap keeper strap is handy, the HOYA UV filter is a must have, and who else cant use another cleaning kit?"
3,nice but overpriced,"borrowed a friend's lens for a tryout. nice lens. very fast. focus is quite precise. but its bokeh (blurred background) is hideous and its barrel distortion a bit too apparent (can fix that in photoshop cs2, but i've yet to upgrade).decided to pass for now (but may be open to a used purchase) ...UPDATE: got one. still don't like its bokeh but it's otherwise a glorious piece of glass. incredibly flexible. the barrel distortion is minor & easily edited out with photoshop.change my rating to almost five stars from three."
5,Worth the money,"Buy it. You will not be unhappy. However, my brother has an 18-135mm. Stepping up from that type of lens might not give you the extra zoom that you want. From an 18-70mm, this is definitely a worthwhile investment."
5,Pefrect walk around lens,"I already owned this lens, and had to buy a 2nd one. My wife and I always were fighting over which lens we wanted to use. We have the Nikon 7-200 mm VR lens, and while it is a great lens it is way to heave to take out on a hike or walking around."
1,Poorly Designed Lens and bad workmanship,"I brought this lens in 2007. First I noticed that when the is lens pointed downward it moves. So you have to hold the lens still and the camera. In Aug. of 2010, the lens started to grind and the image would shake while trying to use autofocus. I did not use the lens very often. So Keep these things in mind if you purchase this lens. By the way, I think the pictures are good."
4,Great for travel,"This lens is great for travel. You will guarantee that you will never miss a shot changing lens. At 18mm, it has some distortion which you will need to correct in post-processing if you shoot landscapes. To sum this lens up; it is a ""jack of all trades and a master of none"". Buy it, you won't be disappointed."
5,NIKON 18-200 MM LENS,I was looking for one lens that I could use on our family vacation so that I would not have to be changing lenses often. This lens is perfect! I am an amateur who likes to take good photos without getting too technical and this is exactly what I have achieved with this particular lens.
5,Nikon 18-200VR,"Although I typically use the 17-35 and 70-200VR lenses, I was tempted by this as a small and light solution for vacations and when I don't want to haul a bag of gear. I have to say that this lens has really revolutionized how I shoot since I now have all of the range that I need (28-300mm effective on the D300) and I can move around and get shots much easier. Tests say that it's not the optical equal of the other pro Nikon lenses I use, true....but in use I've captured wonderful images that are the equal of any other lenses in my bag...except that I can leave the bag at home if I want too!"
4,Great lens...feels cheap,"I'm really loving this lens. Never have owned a VR (or any lens with IS for that matter) and I can definitely see the value of owning a lens with such a feature. Overall, I'm thrilled with it from an operational and photographic results standpoint. The only reason I gave it 4 stars was I didn't feel the quality in all the plastics used. I read a number of reviews touting the quality feel but I have to say, just comparing lens to lens, my Sigma 150mm macro feels sooo much better (the downside being the added weight). The focus and zoom rings on the Nikkor feel 'grainy' - I can feel the friction zooming or focusing.Again, overall I love the lens. It operates and delivers like a $700 lens should, just wish it didn't feel like a $300 lens from a quality standpoint. And to think, I was going to return it to Amazon based on first impressions - absolutely glad I kept it."
4,nice one lens solution but not perfect.,"it's a great lens. considering I only need to bring this lens to a trip to yellowstone instead of the kit+55-200mm lens, going up the hills or to the sizzling springs, capturing bears and moose without getting too near to disturb them.It makes my D40 heavy, but I have no complain about its diverse ability, because I don't need to change lens which could give me immediate ability to zoom at critical moments. Though, It has quite serious (visible) vignetting under bright conditions at 18-35mm.One more problem is that I cannot use it with the built in flash at <24mm. because the lens is too long, the flash will cause a shadow towards the bottom of the picture. Luckily I bought an SB600. if you are trying to use it to take a wide shot indoor for an event, make sure you have enough lighting or an add on flash."
5,Don't leave home without it!,"This is one must have lens. It is sharp, fast and VR technology really works. I can't imagine shooting without this lens.....saves the hassle to keep on changing lenses on a day to day shoot! I highly recommend this lens.."
5,The best Nikon lens,Sorry for the short review but I have had this lens for 3 years and it is hands down the best investment I have made for my camera. you will need no other lens. Buy it NOW!!!!!!
5,Great Lens,"I have been waiting a long time for this lens. I was on many lists to get this lens, but after 6 months a local dealer called me tell he had two in stock. I bought it for 749 plus tax (pretty much the going price) you should buy only from authorized dealers otherwise there is no 5 year warranty. Many dealers advertise for less, but try and buy it from them, they either don't have in stock or try to sell you everything separate (lens hood, lens cap, lens case, etc. By the time you order everything it cost more that others.The lens is awesome, The vibration reduction is outstanding. I consistently get sharp photos at 1/15 at 200mm. I have taken many sharp photos at 1/8 but not as consistent. You must hold camera stable to be able to so this. There is some barrel distortion at the extreme end , but very acceptable. Some vigneting at some stops but again, totally acceptable. I shot with a D70. Buy this lens its the only lens you'll need!!!!!"
5,The only lens you'll ever need,"For any kind of outdoor or well-lit shooting, this is pretty much the only lens I ever use. The AF is super speedy, though it does make a slight grinding noise. My only complaint is that the manual focus ring moves really slowly."
4,Nikon 18-200,"I am an amateur photographer and a mother of two little kids, I still like quality and speed for my pictures. I love this lens b/c I don't need to change lenses, I took it to Disney, the beach and soccer games and it definitely does the work. Unfortunately, when I'm taking inside pics and I use the flash, it shows a shadow and it is very frustrating. I don't know how to get rid of it, I'm thinking about buying another lens for family reunions or indoor activities.If anyone can help, I would appreciate."
5,Nikon 18-200mm,I think this has been great addition. I wish i had got this sooner... takes out the whole part about caring multiple lenses and all of that... One Lens does it all.. great results and very happy to finally have purchased it.
4,Stiff zoom,"After reading about pricing and availability issues of this lens with Amazon, I decided to buy from Ritz and was told delivery would be around 6 months. Imagine my surprise when it came in about 6 weeks.I have not used it much yet, but I am a little disappointed at the stiff zoom control around 80mm. Otherwise it seems ideal for my purposes as a single, go anywhere, do anything kind of lens only marginally bigger and heavier than my original D70 kit zoom lens."
2,there are better alternatives,"I compared Nikon 18-200mm, Sigma 18-200mm and Nikon 18-70mm/Nikon 70-300 mm side by side. At the same focal lengths, Nikon 18-70mm/Nikon 70-300 was better than the Sigma 18-200mm and the Sigma was better than the Nikon 18-200mm in terms of image quality (sharpness and color saturation). If you like the convenience and want to have a wide range zoom lens for your DSLR. The Sigma is better. Alternatively, an advanced all-in-one camera like the Sony H9 or Sony H50 will give you as good or even better picture quality as well as other important features (e.g. wide zoom range, high shutter speed, high ISO, etc)."
3,Executive Director,"Product is defective, suffers from ""Zoom Creep""; Nikon will not replace and Amazon will not exchange. I'm very disappointed with this product."
5,"Great Lens, worth the price","This lens is a fantastic travel lens. It is not the best at one aspect in particular (i.e. not the sharpest or fastest lens you can find in the 18-200mm range), but over all it is great. The addition of VRII means this lens rarely leaves my camera."
4,Great for beginners and if you only had one lens,"When I first started with DSLR photography I was stoked about this lensI got it and could not be happier. 18-200mm fast, take it with me everywhere. It sat on my D40 then my D200Then as a photographer I began to grow. I wanted faster lenses, Prime lenses, etc. Since then this lens has sat in my bagI got a feel for how I like my pictures to be taken and what I needed was something faster. If i wanted zoom I wanted something further.Also since i will be moving up to the FX body soon this lens will be useless since it is a DX lens.As a customer decide if what you plan on doing is moving up in photography and taking it to another level,or being happy with prosumer DSLRs with DX lenses.If it is the latter, get this lensOtherwise invest in fx lenses that will grow with you and this expensive hobby"
3,Nikon 18-200mm Lens,"I had high hopes for this lense because of reviews and Ken Rockwell's e-column. The price kept me from purchasing it, but recently I was able to buy it and I was excited to try it out. I had to return it because I had a problem with auto-focusing, especially on close objects. Also, it was extremely heavy compared to the Nikkor lense I now use. I have arthritis in my thumb and it was difficult for me to use the lense because of its weight. Amazon was great about the return -- I fully expected to have to pay the usual 10 or 15% ""restocking fee"" and also return shipping, but to my surprise Amazon did not require either of those. Amazon's return policies incent me to purchase more items from them in the future."
5,18-200mm,Good all around lens. This replaces all my other lenses except Nikkor 12-24 which is the most usefull lens I own.
5,Amazing Lens !!,I am an amateur photographer. I love closeups and colorful landscapes.This is one amazing Lens. Right out of the box..it proved itself ! Some of the test pictures I shot were just unimaginable without the VR. Focus is fast and the pictures came out sharp. I did not notice any creep.I have a 35-70 and a 70-300 Lens. Now all I need is this lens !! No more problems of Dust getting into the CCD.Thanks Nikon for a superb lens and thanks Amazon for the free PRIME shipping which arrived as promised !!
4,Nikon VR lens,"The optics are very good, the autofocus works very quickly, and the Vibration reduction feature allows me to take pictures in lower light without a tripod. My one reservation about this lens(as compared to the 18-135 lens that came with my D-80) is that when the lens shade is screwed on backwards to be handy but out of the way in lower light situations, trying to zoom the lens is cumbersome because the zoom ring is partially covered by the shade."
2,Versatile lens but poor optic quality,This is my personal view of the lens that I have used for over 3 months. I paid a premium cost for this lens since it is always out of stock and I need the lens for my hiking trip in Yosemite and Canada. I have to agree that the zoom lens range is awesome and it is 1 lens for all activities. The optic quality is poor if you compare it to AFS Nikon 18-70mm. I have many Nikon lenses and I have to rate this 2 star.
4,Great for what it is meant for!,"The positives:The 18-200 zoon range is unbeatable and unbelievable. VR II works great (most of the time), although you should still follow the good rules of holding the camera steady... no sloppy shooting. Lens very sharp for a zoom, not just zooms in this range.The negatives:Most of the negatives are typical of a big zoom. There is noticeable barrel & pincushion distortion, about 90% of which is fixable using Photoshop or PTLens (free) software. Vignetting at the corners is observable. I have not noticed considerable CA, although other reviews do mention it. I also noticed light fall off at the corners in certain situations. But the distortions are considered better than all the zooms of this range.Verdict:If you need just one walkaround lens and dont mind the minor distortions (and have the dough to spend), go for it. The only problem seems to be the endless wait in stores everywhere."
3,Dust in lens,This is a great lens but I take off 2 stars for dust inside the lens--where I cannot clean it.The warranty does not cover dust cleaning.
4,Excellent Wide Range Zoom Do It All Lens,"This is a great lens to keep on your camera for most of the day. It's wide zoom range, excellent optics and quality of build is amazing for the price. One Wish, that it was faster and available for the new FX format."
5,Best LENS?,"This is my first lens, so it's hard to compare it's performance with anything else. But it is a really versatile lens that takes very nice pictures. There are better lens for specific items, i.e. speed, macro, zoom, but this is a good as it gets for having everything in one lens.I recommend it, unless you have problems carring a heavier camera"
5,A great all around lens! Yea Nikon!,"Other than the price being somewhat high this is a super lens to have attached to your camera. No more missed long shots because the short lens was in place. Example: hawk on a wire, 18-55 on camera, change lens, hawk gone.I have experienced no zoom creep while holding the equipment in a downward position and my images are sharp and true to life.I would recommend this lens to anyone. It's the best (in my opinion)."
4,Lens - Good; Amazon - Bad,"Buy this lens elsewhere. Mine was on order for over a year. Then, Amazon ""lost"" my stock.Then it took more months to get it...Meanwhile I had plenty of other orders filled elsewhere (Ritz, BH, Circuit City, Smaller Ships)"
5,Nikon 18-200mm lens,I purchased the lens late in October from a Local photo dealer in Melbourne FL for $699 plus 6% tax. It was the last one he had in stock at that price. The new price was $750. The price had gone up but the sticker on the box showed the price as $699 so he honored that price. Sometimes it pays to buy from a local dealer.The lens is excellent.I am using it on a Nikon D80
3,Great lens - but...,"I've had two of these lenses. The first a great lens, fine images, very good quality. Unfortunately, while on a shoot, the lens was dropped about 3'onto a concrete floor. The zoom ring, focus, all jammed. I got my second lens a couple of weeks ago - although identical there is a lot of slipping, when aiming the camera down. So much so that I have to hold on to the lens to keep it from fully extending. I will return this one and try again. The lens is worth it."
5,New Mexico Western,"Starting immediately from page one, Glen Lanier presents a fast movingsuspenseful drama involving the slaying of Ernesto Valdez by a group ofconspirators attempting to steal his land. Lanier uses his vast knowledgeand personal mountain experience mapping a very imaginative escape takingwounded Emily through an action-packed route to Santa Fe through the rugged Pecos Wilderness of northern New Mexico. The book is thoroughlyenjoyable cover to cover especially the climactic ending and the unexpected surprise awaiting the reader."
4,Great book!,This was a very believable and interesting book. I don't usually read westerns and this was a great book to start out with! The author knows the country and his history very well.
2,Harry Langdon jumps the shark in these films,"These were awful. I loved Langdon in ""The Strong Man,"" and ""Tramp, tramp, tramp,"" but these two films were difficult to sit through. Few comical moments and Langdon seems to have slowed down so much that I almost fell asleep. The audio commentary on, ""Three's a crowd,"" is very informative (who ever did the commentary seems to know everything there is to know about Langdon) but so lavish in its praise of this very dull, unmemorable film that I wondered if I was watching the same film that he was discussing.There's no way to get around the fact that Harry Langdon's films ceased to be ""A"" list films in the late twenties. His career never recovered. There are flashes of genius (yes, genius) here and there in the many shorts and guest appearances he made over the next fifteen years but he was living off of his fame. It's too bad that he didn't quit while he was ahead. Instead, he jumped the shark."
1,Not as advertised,"I bought this heater for spot heating in my attached garage. I wanted a plug in heater that was easy to assemble. The product was advertised as a corded heater including a picture of a cord. When I opened the package there was wiring, but no cord. Also the directions stated not for residential use. The inaccurate product description just was a waste of time for all concerned. I will say the third party distributor was very helpful when I returned the heater and gave me a prompt refund."
5,Excellance,I recommend this book for any reader. I have enjoyed this book. I`m looking forward to reading the rest of the books that she has written.
5,Once again Cassie's amazing,"Once again Cassie's amazing. Although her stories are all somewhat alike, there's always a twist that makes them different and enjoyable. This one is no exception."
2,It's a toothbrush.,"This is a VERY over-rated product. I really don't feel my teeth are any cleaner than using a standard toothbrush, and I may just abandon this thing when the head gives out- I just can't see throwing good money after bad. I liked the Braun electric toothbrush better, and the refills are much cheaper."
5,Tom Russell for beginners,"An absolutely fabulous Tom Russell collection. With block letters. Buy and enjoy.After this album I have bought nearly every record he has published. They are (almost every one) excellent but still I consider this one as the best buy.The lyrics are not just something for filling the empty space but definitely worth intent listening. Often a bit or even more melancholic but they make you think. They are not mere songs, they are stories.If your musical taste is not strictly limited to classical, punk or hard&heavy; I dare recommend this album. This is one of the few I would definitely take with me to a desert island (in addition to Cosmo's Factory, Graceland, Abbey Road, Bruce Springsteen's Seger Sessions and few others)."
2,Lugosi Makes the Most of a Bad Situation,"Wally Brown and Alan Carney prove they are no Abbott and Costello in RKO's bizarre horror-comedy. The only saving grace of ""Zombies on Broadway"" (1945) remains Bela Lugosi as a truly mad scientist. When Bela is off-screen, the movie stumbles in the dark. A strange curio directed by the always-reliable Gordon Douglas."
2,Zombies on Broadway Not one of Lugosi's Best,"This movie is a strange little video featuring Alan Carney, Wally Brown and the ""star"", Bela Lugosi. The plot is 2 public relations men, Carney and Brown, are promoting a former gangster's (ably played by Sheldon Leonard)new nightclub ""The Zombie Hut"" They advertise that a real zombie will be at the opening. The gangster sends the two daffy guys to the island of San Sebastian to find a ""real"" zombie for the opening. Bela Lugosi plays the mad scientist who creates zombies on the island. The plot is pretty predictable as the two PR guys get into one misadventure after another in the land of voodoo. Lugosi has become a caricature of himself by the time this movie was released in 1944. Not the worst movie ever made, but for die hard Lugosi fans only."
4,Missing Episodes,"There were a total of 343 episodes in the original Ralph Edwards TV series ""This Is Your Life."" Most episodes were half an hour long, minus commercials, so the entire collection would be over 150 hours long. In this DVD collection there are only 18 episodes (about 8 hours of video). These episodes are a good cross section of the years the show was on the air, and they represent some of the most notable guests, or the most entertaining individual programs. If you're a collector of memorabilia from the early days of television, then this would be a good addition. But if you are looking for a particular episode (about a particular person), check to make sure it is in the list before ordering the DVD."
4,"Works well, does the job.","I keep my ""paper problem"" under control by using binders, so a paper punch is essential to me. This one works well."
1,Spacing Not Correct and Broke Quickly,"I received this hole punch because I needed a cheap but relatively sturdy hole punch. Much to my dismay this hole puncher (or the one I received) did not have the holes spaced correctly. This hole puncher does let you change the location of the holes, but of course the spacing was too small even at the widest setting. Also within days one of the hole punch's tiny bolts that hold its together started to fall out. I can force it back into place and it works for a couple of sheets before falling out again. Be warned this hole puncher is not worth the hassle. Spend a little more money and get one that works and is spaced correctly."
2,Not the best item,Product not of good quality. Lasted about 2 months and broke. Best to go by one of better quality from any office supply store.
2,Marginal,I knew on the first day I would need those little paper glue on circles that the office people use on paper AFTER using one of these. It's not accurate. Dont buy.
1,ZERO stars is what this game gets.,"Another example of how many truely lousy programmers we have out there. Tell me, how is it a game that gets so much time and money put into it can turn out extinct the day it's released?I'm talking about the controls in this game. Neither Microsoft nor Logitech controllers have been recognized by this game. And even if they had, according to the manual/insert, it wouldn't really matter because only two buttons would be usable when six actions are frequently used on this game. You would think that a game that REQUIRES 800Mhz of processing power, and takes on the classic platform gamestyle, would allow you to use a controller instead of a damn keyboard.I will remember the name ""Global Star Software"", and will avoid any future purchases with their name like the blaster worm."
5,The Greatest Book You Can Give Your Child,"Written with a sharp wit and chocked full of true interesting facts, this book is great for inspiring creativity and a sense of fun in anyone, age 4 and up. If you can find a copy, get it."
2,d generation x dvd,"this is the dvd i was loking for, however i didnt realize it was censored. when it was originally released on vhs it was completely uncensored."
4,Censored?,Was not expecting the movie to be censored. Bought for nostalgic reasons and wasn't disappointed.
1,Avoid - Buy Night Music instead,"There's no question that ToT is great, and that this disc *really is* just about everything they put out, but the ""remastering"" of many of these tracks is a big embarassment... ""Twist"" has painfully OBVIOUS digital distortion through the lead guitar parts, and for some reason someone decided to add a deep flange effect over the whole mix of ""Pops"" which just wrecks it if you know the original. I've tried to return mine to BB to no avail. Night Music may not have *everything* (including the interview which is really about the breakup of bauhaus and not ToT), but the quality is much, much better."
4,this compilation is a must 4 any bauhaus-love&rockets fan,this compilation combines their album and several obscure single/ep's.with the intensity of bauhaus and on the verge of love and rockets.hear the transformation! david j and daniel ash go where peter murphy would not go. it has a few filler songs but the good ones are incredible. bauhaus goes trippy.
4,Good stuff,Everything I had hoped for from the Tones and more. Makes you miss thehalcyon days in which this lively and innovative music was made. A great jobof packaging too - a really solid collection including the pop stuff andthe fun oddities.
4,Not Pop Not Goth,"This is far from Gothic music and Deathrock this is also further from Pop. This too me was like the band Voivod very unique and odd Prog rock/Metal. This band reminds me of Voivod, Marylyn Manson, Primus, Korn, Syd Barret, and The Beatles. The music is either a taste of the past or way ahead of it's time. Lions doesn't sound Gothic sounds kind of like the 60's band the Zombies. Christian Says sounds very fast and metal not slow at all. And War and This is the Pops has a very Bauhaus sound to it. Daniel Ash is a great singer and does alot of unique things with his voice. Getting this discography for only 14 bux is awsome. Can't do that for most bands I wish tho I think we all wish.As far as Goth Burning Skies and Twist Come close but that's it. I love the song Real Life reminds me of Yes. Slender Fungus is a progtastic track Good stuff. A little to Instrumental at times but still good GREAT BAND."
4,SERIOUS HEAD TRIP,"Listen to ""OK This Is The Pops"" in headphones...it's mixed to make your mind melt!!"
1,Save your money!!!,"I've been a big fan of Daniel Ash for years. I've followed Love and Rockets and his solo career and based on that, I figured that Everything by Tones on Tail would be comparable. After listening to both disc's, I've gotta ask, ""What were you guys thinking?"" Did you have a weekend to kill? Need a couple of extra bucks to send the kids to summer camp? Find some new sound effects machines at Radio Shack? Everything strikes me as nothing more than an amateur collection of audio irritation."
4,Best of both worlds,"If Bauhaus was too Gothic for you but Love & Rockets was too new wave, then Tones On Tail is the answer. I think they produced only two albums after Bauhaus broke up and before they formed L & R, and all of their best work is here on this CD. This music is haunting and original, like Bauhaus but without that Peter Murphy edge. Most like L & R's ""Haunted When the Minutes Drag."""
4,Good glove,"I had a very hard time finding a small left handed glove to play Racquetball and when I found this one I didn't hesitate and bought it, I'm very happy with it. I've had it for a while already and it is still in one piece. I play a couple of days a week, so I do use it often. If it breaks I will buy this one again for sure."
3,Some nice tid bits,"I would have to say that there are some nice tid bits of flash wisdom spread through out this book. Not sure if that's worth the price of the book!Also, not really a teaching tool about flash, more of a teaching tool about how Smashing Ideas in Seattle do things!"
5,Great Product!,"This is a really good toothbrush. If you like the feeling of shiny teeth after going to the dentist, this is the toothbrush for you. Every day i think i've already been to the dentist already! Even better, my dentist said that my teeth have been cleaner ever since i started to use this. Plus, it tickles your gums."
3,User for 2 years,"I bought one on Dec 2 2002 and it worked very nicely until today July 07 2004 when it suddenly stopped working w/o any warning. So it lasted about 1 year and eight months or so and that was just with normal use with one person using it 3 times a day. I wish it had lasted a lot longer, it was nice while it lasted."
5,Great Item,"When I first got my dog 9 years ago, both ears were terribly infected. I have tried other products but they did not work. I have been using this product for 5 years now and the vet is impressed at how clean I can get her ears.I also use the Ear Relief Dry after cleaning with this product."
3,"Not a comedy classic, but very funny....","Remember Kenny""BUD"", the neighbor/friend of the youngest Cosby on the Cosby show? Well, he's grown up, and he's trippin... Trippin' was a cute little film about a high school senior named Craig(Kenny). He is always day dreaming(or trippin') about a different life, a life so much better than what he has. His dreams are worth chuckling over, and there were some funny parts throughout the film. It certainly wasn't a laughfest, but I thought it was a cute."
1,"One of the WORST movies, EVER!!","I, along with one of the other people who rated this ""movie"", thought the cover looked pretty cool. I also thought it sounded pretty decent.. That was the biggest waste of $1.00 I have ever spent!! It started slow, the acting was awful... And don't get me started on the ending of the movie!! How horrible!! Most of the plot had some potential, maybe if the budget was more than $6,500 dollars, the ticking clock and dripping faucet wouldn't have taken up so many scenes in the movie... Uggh... What a horrible ending scene!!"
3,ok so far,"the game is ok so far, though i stopped playing after a couple of days to play a different game i bought at the same time. as i've enjoyed the other game so much, i'll get back to this one after. but...like i said, its ok so far. graphics are different, not bad though. voices aren't the best, but what they have to say is pretty bad indeed! gameplay is ok, fighting can be frustrating at times though.so yea, its OK so far!"
4,my review,"This game is fun. It took me a second to realize that its best to make friends with everyone. The game was sort of short to me, but with two different endings depending on choices made, I ended up playing again. Definatly good for a gamer whos bored or for kids. If your looking for something more hardcore this is not for you."
4,Awesome game,"""First time ordering... I was a little nervous, but the item arrived super-fast, was in EXCELLENT condition. It was even still wrapped in the original package! Thanks for helping me complete my collection! I would definitely buy from this seller again!"""
4,"Haven't played it, but I might just...","I've played Dragon Warrior, Rogue Galaxy, and many of the other games recommended with this one. I like the graphics and gameplay of those games, so if they are claimed to be like this one, I can't very well turn it down."
3,Great Engine; Painful Story,"The low down is this: The recruitment part of the game is great and addictive. Battle; likewuse fun. Graphics: Not too shabby.The Story/Writing: Wow. Was this i the Speicial Olympics for Writing? This has the most painful dialogeI've witnessed; the worst plot ever partaken, the worst pacing possible. WHY??? Really, could've been a great game if it wasn't for the cringing for every cut scene."
2,Infantile,"The game play is simplistic, the environments too restrictive (it's little more than a side-scroller) and the graphics sub par."
5,It's worth six stars,"Due to an omission in Amazons catalogue I have to subscribe my review here, because this is not the original recording of the masterpiece of Duke Ellington and his band. That original appeared on BMG 74321257632 (1995) as the essential reissue with the original cover. There have been more covers of the original with extra mixes etc., but I think that the BMG is best, because I like music taken from the mastertape which has not been tempered with in any digital way. Even the famous mumbling of the master in the beginning ""At Lib On Nippon"" has been preserved on this original and I should not know why digitalization could add something here.The sound quality of this original is so stunning and lifelike, that you should search for this one!"
4,Most excellent beer-drinkin' music!,"If you've been in the South, particularly TEXAS, this is a set of cuts that'll remind ya of bein' there! I'm from Bossier Parish, Louisiana, and lived several years in Biloxi MS, and this is MY KINDA MUSIC. Movin' groovin, beer-drinkin' and hard-drivin' kinda music. Don't care if you drive a truck or a Honda (or ride a Harley, like me!) this Watson set-a-cuts will get yer blood flowin', yer feet-a-movin', and yer heart a poundin'. Buy it. Do it. Now."
1,I threw it away,"Living in Australia it is very difficult to obtain regency romances and it is therefore doubly disappointing when a book is as poorly written as this one.It started well enough, with a tall misunderstood heroine and a clearly delineated hero, tantalisingly in absentia for several chapters. Small solecisms such as calling a lady of quality a 'bird of paradise' (slang for a courtesan), whilst annoying, are minor details. From there on it goes downhill.Character development is minimal, unlikely situations abound and the continual bandying of bad-tempered words gives a disagreeable tone to the whole story. Oddly enough, considering that the heroine's flaw in the eyes of society is her height, another unlikeable character is continually ridiculed for her weight. Regencies need an underlying good humour and light touch to succeed and this one was tedious indeed. It went straight into the charity bin."
1,Cheap junk,Looked decent and the price was right so I purchased. Worked for a couple of months showing a temp between the numbers then just died. Its throwing away money unless you are looking for a product to work while traveling for a bit. Surely not built for any decent time in the cellar. Spend more and buy a real one.
5,Easy Wine Temp,"Forget the probes and the infra-red devices -- this is simple to use and it works. Remember to grasp the back tabs of the device so it snugs up to the wine bottle for the best reading.Very clever device!!!! However, I bought it new for $7 under the name of Soma Wine Thermometer in a liquor store in Ohio this March.REW"
3,Mediocre at best,This wine bottle thermometer isn't quite what I expected. It takes a while for the guage to recognize the temp and then is difficult to read. I wish I would've paid more for a little nicer one.
3,just ok,Thermometer reading is not all that accurate. The concept is great but the thin metal cuff does not provide a really secure grip to the bottle to get an accurate reading.
4,Good thermometer,"I bought this thermometer because I wanted to check the bottle's temperature BEFORE opening the wine. Unfortunately, the display is on Fahrenheit only, not Celsius. It comes with an indicator of which temperature is the best for which type of wine. Relatively easy to read;"
4,"Works well, a little loose","Reading is clear, guide is helpful, works within seconds. A little small for standard size wine bottle. It expands to fit around but then doesn't lay flat. But it stays on and it works, and it wasn't an arm and a leg. Giving one to my parents for Christmas."
2,Excellent Group; Bad Sound Reproduction,"One of my favorite singing groups from my youth, I was very disappointed with the sound from these ""re-mastered"" recordings. The original vinyl sounds much better. Save your money and play the vinyl record if you have it. It has to be better than this poor reproduction. Put this CD down, down and away."
2,One New Song for a King's Randsom!,"No..they couldn't give us the remaing 5th dimension Studio cds with Bonus tracks.....off course not..lets instead release another collection of songs and add ONE unrealsed gem to get the fans money.....As much as I have NEVER burned a cd, when they go for $20 for ONE new song, I sure understand how ONE might want to burn cds instead of buying them."
5,This person is tone deaf,"The review of 1/30/2004 claims that this collection is marred by poor sound - nothing could be further from the truth. I own ALL of the 5th Dimension Soul City and Bell albums on CD, including the compilations, and I assure everyone reading this review that ""The Ultimate 5th Dimension"" is a first-rate collection, sounding just as good as the 1997 ""Definitive Collection"", and THAT was 20-bit remastered by Bob Irwin at Sundazed Music. If you don't want to pop for the double-disc set, you CANNOT go wrong buying this. Pop it in your CD player and prepare to be wowed."
3,I've only got two words....,".. Lizz Wright. Period.The most transcendent, ethereal, silky and breathtaking voice on that stage belonged to Lizz and she's the only reason I bought the DVD.Not to say that many of the other performers weren't great as well, but Lizz Wright is probably the best new vocalist of the 21st century so far.She's the new Ella, Sarah or Aretha.If you want to cry from the beauty, depth, richness and sheer grace in song, pick up any of Lizz Wright's albums. ;-)"
5,Awwwwwwwwwesome,I had the pleasure of meeting Marilyn at this summer's SanDiego comic convention where she happened to have this book for sale. I have to say that it's one of the best tools I've seen in a long while to connect and do something fun and creative with kids.I've got a couple of nieces waiting for me to cut some stuff up with them.I can't wait.Thanks for the book and the passion Marilyn.Steph
5,A WONDERFUL LITTLE BOOK!,I bought this book for my wife after we saw a high school musical by the same name and based upon this book. The play was excellent and actually would have been better if we had read this book first.
5,Reminds me a little of the ole Surf rock ballads ...,"Discovered this duo when I was in Lisboa last month. Their music was a little rockabilly, a little Hawaiian at times, and surprisingly good. I liked it."
1,He andi,loved it recommend it to al who would be interested. I have one for years I just wanted close friend to have it and she loves it
2,"Great book, but condensed version","The book is phenomenal and very uplifting, but I was not aware that I was purchasing the condensed version. It says it on the book, but not on the description of the book when I ordered it nor on the picture of the book. That seemed to be a little misleading to me."
2,Bad quality,The book is a phenomenal book and i would recommend it to anyone. I purchased it after borrowing it from a friend. The seller I was less than pleased with. It arrived a bit later than expectected and the quality of the materials of the book is poor. Very thin pages and the cover honestly looks like a knock off. Like they photographed the original book and made a copy cheaply. i will not be buying from SuperDealsOnWeb again.
5,The Bible first-then its this book!,"I love this book. Anyone who happens upon this book is a destiny happening. This strange little man came up to me in bookstore many years ago and said,'if you don't buy this book, I will buy it for you."" I bought it on the spot and never looked back. Changed my life-Very unusual writings. My dog has chewed this copy ragged. I will quickly buy a few more. This is so profound as to change your life and relationship with Christ, the Lamb of God; making him so approachable and how he loves our communion of closeness and sharing everything with HIM. I love my Lord Jesus Christ so much, now-I can't live without HIM. Its amazing and eye and heart opening. I love it! I wasn't even Catholic when I bought it. Now I'am-but, any faith or human person really can get alot from it."
5,He and I,"These words of love and hope touch the reader personally. Open to any page, and you will discover deeply truthful observations and encouragement, just exactly what you need at that moment. In her own quiet way, Mademoiselle Bossis gave us His love. She made herself His channel of peace. Please do your soul a favor and read this book."
5,read this book,This book is like having conversations with God written down. Highly recommended book. Buy several and share with friends because they won't want to give it back.
3,Lacks decent production,"I liked ""End of a Era"" best on this one. In general I like Stump's melodic stuff, he is far beyond a lot of the classically influenced shredders. But the production on this album was pretty bad, it was hard to make out the ins and outs of his playing. It got a little frustrating to listen to. I'd sure love to see this guy live. Anyway if you are looking for an intro to Joe Stump I would recommend Guitar Dominance, that was awesome. Just put on ""Ultraviolence"" and leave it there ;-)I have Night of the Living Shread (NOTLS) as well which I also liked better than this one. YMMV."
2,My son loves Larry boy but this game is the real bad apple.,"Even for a last-gen game, this one is just bad. Poor controls and level design make me wish I could overlook it flaws but i can't. The 2nd level with the bad apple numbers game was basically impossible and my son and i had to stop playing. It's a shame because Larry boy is his favorite. Skip this if you want to save yourself the headache."
4,Worth the $8 dollars,"I have to say, as the only VeggieTales video game ever made, it was worth the money I spent to own it. After playing, I decided to watchthe actual episode, and I say the video game is still better.While the gameplay was a bit too easy and the plot was not up to par, the artwork and graphics were nice, and the levels were complex. Also, nothing is violent, edgy, steamy, (obviously), so it is perfect for younger children. Puzzles and minigames are also impressive.If you have young children who like an easy little game with nice design, you're in luck, this is the game for you."
2,Difficult to Play,"My daughter (7 yrs old) finds the game frustrating to navigate. Even my husband gets frustrated and he's a hard-core gamer. (WoW, RPGs, PS2, Xbox, etc) I would have been soo thrilled if the game had been a little easier in the area of playability. But, I figure my kids will keep plugging away at it until they finally figure out how to play it without crying!Bottom line, it's our least favorite game. Great concept. Poor playability. Hopefully, Big Ideas will come out with a better user-friendly game."
3,Veggie Tales Larry Boy PS 2 game,"Arrived in good condition and sealed. My son enjoys this game, however the game itself is somewhat difficult. It has no explaination of some parts in the navigation. He finally gave up."
4,Larry boy and the bad apple ps2,"This is an excellent game. My children 7 and 12, both girls have been Veggietale watchers. This game also is enjoyed by a 12 year old boy who visits at our house a lot. Its a great game"
2,"Two stars because it's Larryboy, but that's about it.","Graphics are ok, nothing great. Game is boring and frustrating at times. Very mundane, a lot of ""grabbing musical notes"". After you have played this game for about 15 minutes, you will never want to hear Alfred's voice again. I would not buy this game again."
2,"Fun, but poor quality","My 9-year-old likes this game alot. Our complaint, though, is in the quality of the disk. The game freezes at a particular point. Veggietales gladly replaced the disk, but the 2nd one also freezes at the same point. I have called Crave Entertainment several times over the last 2 weeks to see if it's our equipment. I get a message saying ""Sorry our game isn't working, we'll call you back."" But so far they haven't called back-the implication being that they have alot of games that don't work! I would return it and get my money back, but my son says it's fun up to that point, and he wants to keep it. I rated it 4 stars for fun, because it is frustrating when the game freezes."
3,So-so Treats,"They were crumbly and, surprisingly, the dogs were fairly unexcited about them when we went to give them the treats."
5,Our Dog Loves Them,"We have been feeding our dog these ""Good for Them"" treats since the line came out. She loves them."
1,Serious Design Flaw Renders This Watch Nearly Useless!,"The Fossil FS4008 watch is a very handsome, no-frills watch with a dial I can see without my glasses. Initially I loved this watch, but after a few months, I discovered a serious design flaw that renders the FS4008 useless as a reliable timepiece.Most watches have a stem that you pull out to set the time. On this watch, though, you push the stem in to set the watch. And when the stem is in, the watch stops! For a while, the resistance was great enough that I never noticed the backwards orientation. But after a couple of months I began finding my watch stopped several times a day. It has gotten to the point that I'm setting my watch nearly every time I look at it! Not exactly a desirable characteristic in a chronometer!Too bad, as this was a very pretty watch. Time for a 10-dollar Timex!"
5,The journey of love begins,"This is the first cd produced by Patti[although the firct one ""tears of joy"" won a grammy for best new jazz artists]...Mixed in a muted fashion, it requires a lot of volume on the stereo.It contains many songs destined to become concert favorites.Little Wing/Castles Made of Sand took a stroke of genius to combine and is guaranteed to bring tears to your eyes-you just know Jimi is sayin'yeah!If you see them in concert and Tuck does not do Europa you have got to go back!A fine second effort from the world's greatest guitar player and jazz vocalist who just happen to be soul mates and performing for our benefit."
4,Pretty Earrings,"The earrings came on time and were very well made. I thought they would be a bit larger, but overall I am very happy with this purchase."
1,"Dreadful, dreadful,dreadful ...","Having been pleasantly surpirsed by the style, quality and wit of Random, this album was a deep disappointment.While the amount of creativity and work which went into the first album is immediately apparent, Random 2 seems to have been thrown together by several spotty adolescents in an afternoon.The producers of this album ought to be ashamed of themselves.Even hardened Numan fans should stay well clear."
1,"A $13 coaster, unworthy of being associated with the artist.","While I would not hesitate to recommend Random, the first CD of Gary Numan material performed by other artists, this CD, as described by another Numan fan, gave me a nose bleed. The meandering mish-mash of drum machines and random samples (pun intended) is not what I call entertainment. Most of the songs, if you can call them that, are unrecognizable and seemingly unrelated to originals. They even have the gall to include a track from Random! If you are a devoted Numanoid, and have to have any and all material that is even in the least bit associated with Numan, go ahead and buy this. For the rest of us, what we have here is a $13 dollar coaster."
3,I have a mixed feeling about this one,"I can understand both sides: the reviews that compliment Ms. Moyet on her creativity; and the reviews which call it unmemorable. I think it's because there is a mix of styles on this cd that don't always work. For example, the song ""Mary, don't keep me waiting"" sounds defiantly mid 1980's while ""Say It"" and ""Ski"" are very contemporary. However, there are more timeless and haunting I-won't-take-no-for-an-answer ballads like ""Should I feel that it's over"", ""If you don't come back to me"", and ""You don't have to go"". These are songs that Ms. Moyet arguably does as well as, if not better than, anybody working today. I guess I was hoping for a more uniformly contemporary sound throughout the disc but I can't deny that there are some wonderfully innovative songs here that I have come to appreciate more with each hearing."
3,"Home, not so fast.","When I first heard that Alison was working with the Insects Production team, not knowing who they were, I thought it sounded like an interesting match. It doesn't really work here, within the LP you'll find depressing compositions that owe more to lyrical poetry. Moyet's voice is triumphant, but the music writing leaves so much to be desired. Not one track here you can sing-along with or even dance to. I love the Moyet ballads, but the Insects should have understood her fan base to the extreme. This is like a nap to an insomniac. Give us the cloud of down again Alison, we need a full night's dreaming."
3,I tried to like this CD - honest,"I have adored Alison Moyet's voice from the early Yazoo days and the thought of a new CD was exciting. Having listened to this latest offering I have to admit I feel rather disappointed. The voice is still there but the songs themselves are rather unmemorable - I've listened to it several times but can still barely recall most of the tracks. It starts off promisingly with Yesterday's Flame and has it's moments (More is an interesting track), but I found myself having trouble remembering many of the tracks after they had gone - not a good sign for one of the most exciting voices out there. Not a highlight in my book I fear."
3,Big fan of Alison; this album? Not so much.,"From reading all the other reviews of this album, I was expecting to be blown away. I wasn't all that thrilled. There are a few songs that are good, but I was more disappointed than impressed. Not one of her better creations."
4,That amazing voice&#65533;,Moyet's new music is like a rare but beautiful magical spell. She come across like a new millenium Dusty Springfield but all on her own unique style and gorgeous voice. Moyet takes you on a musical trip and totally hipnotize you. One of the best music performances of 2002. Best wishes for Miss Moyet; Bravo!
4,Explore two frontiers with one family.,"The Dyson's, Freeman and George, are father and son. Freeman, a nobel laureat physicist, has his sights set on the stars. George lives in a tree house in British Columbia and has combined modern materials and ancient techniques to build the largest canoe on the inland water way. See what happens when they reunite in the company of a pod of killer whales.This is my second read. Not my usual practice.My one major disappointment is the exclusion from this paperback edition of a section about Freeman Dyson's work on a ""safe"" nuclear reactor. I found this section particularly interesting because of the specific subject and because of the learning and work principles illustrated. This was an inappropriate job of editing.Read, enjoy and learn about learning and living and relating in our complex and conflicting world."
4,Good book,"I liked the book's story, but not the way it was told. The author interjected his opinion and personal bias too many times for it to be anything biographical. However, it was a neat story."
2,Stan Laurel Collection 2,"Stan Laurel, in my opinion, was the greatest comic genius that ever came into the movies during it's golden age. Not only were his ideas unique, but they were funny without being morbid, dirty, sexual, or suggestive. In this collection, the films are beautifully preserved, but there were problems with ""skipping"" and some of the films were so badly skipping electronically, that I had to shelve it in my library and put it away. It needs replacing."
3,"Stan Laurel, comedian alone","Bought DVD out of curiosity wanting to see comedianSTAN LAUREL. Only a few movies were really worthwatching like ""HUNS AND HYPHONS"" with Larry Semonand Madge Kirby, and ""DO YOU LOVE YOUR WIFE?"" and""GET EM YOUNG"". The rest of the movies only take upspace and show that you took a risk when you enteredthe theatre of not knowing when a comedy was good orbad or worst plotless. I recommended this for themovies I mentioned, but not for anything else. Butit is worth looking at, as a study, as a reminder ofSilent-Film comedies.----- Luisa Felix,[...]"
4,Used to brush up on CHEMISTRY,Used this to brush up for the teas test. I really needed to review my Chemistry and this really helped me.
4,good review,"Great book for a quick chemistry review. Definitely need to have a background to understand everything, but overall is a great refresher"
1,DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK,"If your confused about chemistry do not get this book. The chapters do not provide enough explanation for the problems, and the examples are different and simpler than the problems it didnt help."
1,The book my biology teacher made me read,"This book is good for a person who likes Science, but me i dont like science to me its boring. I liked maybe one sentance of the book but otherwise I Didnt like it."
5,Retro Bob Wills!,"This is the third album of Big Sandy with his Fly Rite Boys. Nice retro western swing, songs are mostly originals. An exception is ""Have You Ever Had the Feelin'"" which is written by Webb Pierce and the king of western swing Bob Wills. A special guest on this record was Adrian Demain, who recorded with Lee Rocker, Swing Cats, Billy Bacon & Forbidden Pigs and Supersuckers!"
1,heart and soul by ronnie milsap,I paid $25.00 for this CD. There was one song that I really wanted. The CD has many scratches and of course the largest and deepest scratch is right through the song I wanted most. I am very disappointed. I have reordered and hope for the best.
4,Mixed Blessings,"The stories in here were very uneven, and it was questionable if they even fit into the Planetary storyline or not. Having said that, even the ones of less than great quality were still good and enjoyable. I wish they'd made it plane if the stories were canon or not, but that's a minor complaint at best. This is a good read for fans of Planetary, Batman,and/or Alternate Superhero History."
5,Question- What does this trade encompass ?,"Hate to do this but there's little to no info. Does this trade pick up where the Fourth Man left off, encompassing some of the retro history of Planetary ? (Snow's meeting with Holmes and Co.,the Elders' Song etc). Having trouble determinining if this is something I've read or not.Thanks."
2,"Great show, but why buy now?","The series finale, the 80 minute Xmas special, airs next month. And box set will be incomplete without it, so it makes no sense to buy now. Wait it out!"
4,REVIEW - RECOMMENDED,PRODUCT ARRIVED IN EXCELLENT CONDITION. PLEASED WITH SERVICE AND DEALER. GOOD PRICE FOR QUALITY ITEM
2,Not satisfied,"I received ""Extras"" the complete first season & the complete second season BUT the discs for the second season are both the same disc (disc 2). I did not receive disc 1 (episodes 1, 2 & 3) of season 2. I am very disappointed!"
2,Seems Cheap,Got this thing and was disappointed. Just seems like a cheaply made little knife. The 30+ dollar original price is hard to believe.
5,I Love this System,"I purchased this Home Theater System to go with my new 52"" Samsung LCD TV. I considered many others and finally ordered this because of the Samsung name. I had no idea what to expect.I set it up in a medium sized room and the 1200 watts will rock the house. I can't imagine needing any more sound. I am certainly not an audiophile, but this is all I need. I know that you can get much more. If you feel that you need it, and are willing to pay the price, then go for it. I'll stick to my Sammy and be perfectly happy."
5,"Just buy it, no regrets",It is easy to hook up. I have big parties and this sound system helps keep the party rockin. Very clean and crisp sounding. I recommend this to anyone who will listen. You can't go wrong with a samsung anyway. You should take a chance to have a chance.
4,Works great with that new HDTV + PS3,"I just recently purchased the Samsung LNT4065F 40"" 1080p LCD HDTV, and got this as a matching home theater. Opted not to get the HT-X72 or HT-X75 tall boy speakers simply for portability. I have the Sony PS3 hooked up to the TV via HDMI, and I have the digital optical out on the TV going into this receiver and the surround sound is great on Blu-ray and PS3 Games."
4,GOOD,"I BOUGHT THIS AS A GIFT FOR A FRIEND TO SUPPLIMENT THE SAMSUNG HI DEF LCD TV HE HAS. SOUNDS GREAT. WISH THE MINI-SPEAKERS HAD A MORE SECURE BASE ON WHICH TO REST.FOR THE WIRELESS EFFECT OF THE REAR SPEAKERS HAD TO SHALL OUT ANOTHER $100 TO BUY THE SAMSUNG WIRELESS 'TRANSMITTER'.MY LOGITECH WIRELESS Z5450 COSTS MUCH LESS YET WORKS EXCELLENTLY FOR THE PAST THREE YEARS.COMPARATIVELY, THE SAMSUNG IS NOT BAD OVERALL."
4,Great Theater System!,"Great system. It's as advertised. Can't wait to get it set up permanently down in the family room!It's now Jan '09 and I love the system. The only ""con"" I have is something that I saw critiqued earlier. Who was the engineer that designed the speakers? God what a mistake. They would only stand up on a hardwood floor, with no breeze .... MAYBE!! My guess is he never set it up and tested it. I would put that engineer in the ""box"" that I put Tech Writers in! I plan on mounting small plates to the bottom of some of the speakers and that will solve my problem. I wouldn't recommend this only because of the speaker shapes. Otherwise, I love the setup."
2,lemons,"Great system if it worked properly. Our first receiver would play the sound and video out of sync and would take forever to load one time and load it right away the next time. We exchanged the first one and it worked a little bit better but would make a loud humming sound, and would skip randomly for no reason with brand new media. Everybody seems to love samsung but we've had bad luck with this brand. Had a camera that died right after the 30 day warranty was up. We took the system back to the store and will never buy this brand again no matter how nice it may look."
1,Samsung burns up exhaust fan,"It's not good when you set up home theater system and you smell burning circuits. That's what happened to my brand new system when I set it up. It was purchased through Amazon but OneCall was the distributor. Since I did not keep the original box, OneCall would not exchange the unit leaving me to contact Samsung for warranty work. Seems to me this is a big reason not to purchase from and online store.I will eventually service the unit, but ultimately went out and bought a Sony Bravia theater system at my local electronics store that works beautifully. Thanks for nothing Amazon an OneCall!"
3,Life in the big city,"Frankly, this is one of those books which I find hard to say anything good or bad about. It's a pleasant read, filled with quiet wit, and anyone who's lived in New York will recognize most of the characters therein.On the other hand, that's about it. The Tenants of Moonbloom isn't horrible. It's simply... uncompelling? Unmemorable? In any case, it's a novel which you can pick up, spend a few enjoyable hours with, then put down and forget all about. Then, months later, when you see it lying besides your sofa, you can begin the process all over again."

5,great book!,"I have always heard about this book, and finally read it. It is great! I thought it would be boring, but it is very exciting. Read it!."
5,Very different story,It might have been a different story from the movie but it was a very enjoyable story!!!! Defiantly will recommend
5,I really like this book,I really like this book because it has exciting adventures. The Wizard is only a humbug.I never thought that until I read this book. I really like this book because of the land of Oz
3,Ken's review,This was a wicked book! Especially true part when she killed the wicked witch of the east . Again this is a wicked book
5,Very good,"Colorful, vivid, and imaginative; this is a valuable classic and the world is a better place because it is available for free!"
4,Review on the wizard of OZ,The book was excellent it got very long at times to where is got boreing but the character and the details felt as if I was in the land of OZ myself
5,Beautiful rendition!,Excellent quality; brought me back to my childhood! Beautiful illustrations. I expect this will be a family treasure for many years to come.
3,The wizard of oz,"It was interesting and fun to read. Even though it is 24 chapters, every single one is exciting and full of action and elaboration and nothing is boring in the book#"
4,very happy,"It was swift to arrive, a beautiful hard cover classic. it had a soft sheet cover as well. Very Happy."
5,Wizard of Oz,"I really enjoyed this book. You should read it too! It is full of adventure , laughs , and amazing places."
3,Why I loved the wonderful wizard of oz,I loved the wonderful wizard of oz because it is a whole lot of fun and a whole lot of imagination
4,The Wonderful Wizard Of Oz Review,This book was amazing it was a true page turner and I look forward to the next book The Land Of Oz.
4,Fun story of Adventure in a strange land,"This was a very fun little story. I have seen the movie probably a dozen times, and it was fun to see how the novel differed from the movie.One thing I thought was interesting is that the wicked witch is really just another adventure in a long journey. The movie tries to make her the primary villain, but she's not that big of a deal in the book. I can definitely see why the movie was changed to give the story arc a more clearly defined climax. The book is more like a travelogue through a strange country, and ends somewhat abruptly.Ultimately, it is a fun travelogue, and I always enjoy books that show fantastic landscapes with fantastic creatures, and this book has plenty of that. But it wasn't quite the story you would expect after watching the movie.I look forward to reading the rest of the series, particularly the ones that go beyond the movies I have seen. I'm excited to see what other adventures await Dorothy."
5,This book was good,The book was very with every detail and the fantasy that just pops. It was way better than the movie.
2,The wonderful wizard of oz,It was a fairly good book. It was very long though it took me a whole week to read it
4,Thumbs up,"It was very engaging,I personally liked it more then the movie,and I wish they didn't change the story a bit in the movie"
5,A wonderful book,"I have always loved the movie based on this book, but I had never taken the time to actually read it. I am so glad that I did because it is now one my favorites!"
5,Very good!,I'm very happy I chose this book as my first read on my new kindle. It was a lot better than the movie.
4,I loved this especially with narration,This book is a old and amazing classic I recommend it to everyone young and old. I personally think that it is better than the movie.
5,Amazing book,This is the most best book I ever readThis book is rated 10for one reason because it is awsome
4,Very creative,Loved the book more than the movie kids should read it best book ever!!! My favourite by far read it
5,A Wonderful Classic,"""The Wonderful Wizard of Oz"" is one of the best well known and beloved modern fairy tales. However, most people have only come to know it thanks to the wonderful film adaptation of the same name. To be sure, the film version is probably one of the best movies of all time, but there is something to be said for reading the book in its own right. The book turns out to be as wonderful and endearing as I had expected, with all the main characters portrayed in greater depth and with even more attention to their human distinctiveness. There are also a few scenes in the book that had not made it to the movie, and it was interesting to read these for the first time. The book is charming and well written, although some people today might have an issue with a few violent scenes that tend to be more graphic than what acceptable in children's books these days. Personally I was not bothered by this one bit, and view the book as good, clean fun."
5,Collectable,Ordered this book because previous successful realtionship with Amazon and was not disapointed. My grandchildren will read this book to their children.
5,sarahs rating,i found this book very exciting. i rate it five stars for its excitment adventures and how it ends with everyone bein happy.
5,"The WONDERFUL, WONDERFUL Wizard of Oz","The Wonderful Wizard of Oz is my favorite book (don't be surprise if I change it). I like it because the situations seem real and so do the characters. I think my favorite is the Tin Woodman and Dorothy. The book is about Dorothy, her dog, and three other friends. They are determined to go to the Wizard of Oz (sound familiar?). It's very different from the movie, though the movie was great too. I love Judy Garland.This actually isn't my edition, all though it is a Dover edition. The illustrations by W. W. Denslow are the best ones that I've seen and it's just really a good book. Besides the last few chapters (which get very long) I loved the book and would rate it 10 stars, but unfortunately you can't.Anyway, I really like the book and I highly recommend it."
1,A Big Disappointment,"I was very disappointed in the quality of this edition. I thought it would be a reproduction of the original edition, but the paper was was of a very low quality and the illustrations, while the originals, were flat. The originals I believe were engraved.I returned this item."
4,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,"Dorthy is a girl who lived in Kansas. But one day there is a terrible storm and it carries Dorthy, her dog Toto and her house into the land of Oz. When Dorthy had waken up she had been told that she had killed the wicked witch. Dorthy is then told to go to the Wizard of Oz and see if the wizard could get her back to Kansas. Along the way she meets and makes new friends. I really thought this book was interesting and strange. I would recommend everyone to read this fantastic book."
4,Great,"I ahve been interested in reading this series for a few months finally looked to see if it was available for my kkindle, I was so excited to see it was."
4,Finally read,"I grew up watching the Movie. I have read ""Wicked"". So I have wondered what was the difference. There was alot that was left out in the movie. Now I Must must read the rest of the books."
4,You should read it,Good book.everybody should read it there are so many versions but this one is the absolute best one I have ever read
5,The wonderful wizard of oz,"Wonderful book for ages 9 and up!! So interesting, that you will never want to stop! Great for book clubs too."
2,A terrible edition,"The text print is inconsistent, faded and patchy. Portions of font are missing completely in places. It overlays illustrations on some pages and becomes nearly unreadable."
3,Un clasico,"Un libro entretenido de grandes aventuras escrito en un lenguaje sencillo para grandes y chicos, recomendable para pasar un buen rato."
4,Love the Wizard,Ever since I was a kid I read the Wizard of Oz! I've read it many times over the years including the many sequels that Baum wrote. It was time to read it again. This is not like the movie but continue reading and you'll experience the real story.
3,Ehhh,The book was ok it kept me somewhat entertained but was nothing like the movie that we all know and love
2,Loved it,I loved this book. It was so amazing and interesting and awesome. I loveeeeeeeeeeeddddddddddd it. It was the best book I've ever read.
4,Wizard of Oz,Good book is a very very good book book I repeat is a very good book you should read it
5,Makes a Great Gift!,"Arrived in time for gift-giving and was much appreciated! Like many, they had seen the Judy Garland version of the movie but hadn`t ever gotten to read the REAL story. Special Anniversary edition makes an ideal gift, beneath it`s outstanding dust jacket is facsimile of first edition binding. Inside is also identical to the original with ALL of it`s wonderful artwork! This edition is further enhanced by gilded page edges & emerald green satin bookmark (bond in). Sure to be cherished and enjoyed by future generations too."
4,The Wizard Of Oz,Although the service was great (hence the four stars)and I do not wish to return the item that was sent because it is a beautiful book It is not the one i ordered --- I ordered the one in the picture that comes up The Wonderful Wizard Of Oz - I recived one by Frank Baum but it is Titled The Wizard Of Oz and is a childrens version much smaller than the version I ordered. my other question is Is the price different on the one I received than I the one I really ordered and that shows up in my Lib
1,Not the expectation,"I suppose wouldn't say this is a bad book, but having read the Wicked first, I anticipated a much more detailed and involved story."
2,Good or Bad,"Is it possible that this book is really over? It's just so good,excellent, exiting, hopeful, funny, and full of surprises."
4,Good story but very different than the movie.,This was a nice story with a lot of subtle jokes throughout the book. I recommend reading the book before watching the movie.
4,Worth reading,I started reading this when the movie came on tv for Thanksgiving. The background stories you do not get in the movie and parts of the story makes it worth reading if you love (or hate) the movie. I will now want to read the other books about Oz by L Frank Baum.
4,loved it!,Wonderful story line. It had been a few years since reading ut last and it is just as I remember it as a child.
3,The movie was sooooo much better!,"It was interesting to see what happened to Baum's original story on the way to the film. For the most part, I found the film a definite improvement. The language of the book was wooden compared to the film: ""the road of yellow brick"" vs ""the yellow brick road,"" for example."
1,Horrible,this book was amazingly horrible and terrible .I cant belive this was published.I would not even buy it .Any books with this type of cover is bad .
3,Do you know who the Wizard REALLY is?,"When I first read the book as a child, I had no idea (and probably could not appreciate) that it had historical significance. Now, as an adult student of History, I am fascinated by its allegorical interpretation as applied to late 19th-century America."
2,The Movie Was Better Than The Book!,"This is one of those rare cases in which the motion picture was an improvement over the book. The story that L. Frank Baum tells is spooky and unrealistic, while the movie puts a human form and realistic vision on the story."
4,Not what you'd expect...,"To compare the book to the movie would be unfair. The bookhas a style all its own. Told In a simplistic fashion, it reads as a childrens book. Quite imaginative in scope, it's a fun read."
3,Good for children,The story line was very good. I wouldn't recommend this book for Children over the age of 13. But it was a great book none the less.
4,As solid as the yellow brick road,"This is a timeless classic -far less traumatizing than its abridged film version- telling a tale of endless adventure as Dorothy and her motley crew of misfit companions each searching for something missing in their lives.Filled with life lessons fit for young and young at heart.I've rated it 4+ on the following scale.+ poor read++ so-so read+++ good read++++ excellent read+++++ life changing readI would rate the kindle format 5+ with no observed formating issues, or typos, and for the inclusion of a fully indexed table of contents."
1,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,It was not like the movie. I was very disappointed in it. I was bored throughout the whole entire book.
2,Loved it,I loved it. It was very different than the movie with Judy garland but like it a lot better than the movie.
3,Great read,Great read. Several parts of this I would love to see on film. I enjoyed the book a little more than the old film. My only complaint is that this book feels rushed while reading it and the ending is rather abrupt. But overall it's a great book and I will enjoy 're-reading it to my children.
5,Worth Reading,"This book was fantastic, and very fun to read also. You can see differences throughout the book from the movie, although most is the same."
4,Dan,A great classic. A movie could be made with today's modern technology to more accurately depicted this book. I'd go see it.
5,Wonderful book,"I read this as a child and loved being reunited with it! Great story, and has a lot of details they could not fit in the movie."
3,probably another,freebie or cheapie book i bought. been collecting for later reading. it's one of the classic books so why not!
5,Surprising,"Since this is an older book I assumed the language would be difficult to read, but it wasn't at all. I thoroughly enjoyed the story and I loved making comparisons to the movie version. If you ask me, the book and the movie are on two totally different spectrums. You have to take each one as it is. I love them both and would recommend this book to anyone. It can be a little creepy, but it has a good message in it."
4,I am a sixth grader and i liked this book,"For my review i will do a comparitively to the movie. For one thing, in the movie Glinda was the witch of the north but in the book she was the witcch of the south but still was the witch who got dorothy home. Also, many munchkins did not greet dorothy in the beginning, there were only 3 muchkins there and the witch of the north who's name you never hear. In conclusion i would recommend this book if you liked the movie ""The wizard or Oz."" or if you just like good fantasy stories. I hope this review was helpful."
5,White Hot Live,"Carlos Santana has always been a soulful guitarist, and disk two of this two disk collection confirms it. The live licks by both Carlos and Neal Schon, the young guitar prodigy who went on to fame and fortune with Journey, sound crisp and clear, yet they are not formulaic. It's free flowing yet structured. Santana's guitar sound can't be necessarily defined, but you know it when you hear it. The same holds true for the precussion section of the band. This section is what makes the live disk go. Vocalist and keyboard player Gregg Rollie is in peak playing form. It's a shame that this version of the band didn't stick together, for whatever reason. As one other reviewer noted, it is simply inexplicable that this live disk sat in some tape can somewhere for so long. Disk one, the original release plus extras, still sounds fresh. The extras on disk one are excellent, particularly Folsom Street. This new Legacy edition is worth the price."
3,"Whoa, Nelly","While disc one is the hottest Santana studio album ever, the second disc is a sonic disappointment. The mix is horrible in certain spots, like not being able to hear the singer or the second guitar leads. Conversely, in other places the percussion is so high in the mix you can hardly hear anything else. Maybe I am spoiled by other live recordings from the same era, but be forewarned."
5,good stuff,"i have been enjoying carlos santana and his music, ever since i saw Woodstock at the movies all those years ago.this is a must listen for music lovers."
1,dissappointed,I had the same problem with this helmet. I bought this for my 3 year old and she wore it once for about 10 minutes and the inside sticky stuff came undone and would not stick anymore. I thought of buying some 2-way tape but as soon as you move the plastic piece that fits around the back of the head both pieces come undone.
5,It will take your breath away!,"This book is a must have for those intrigued with Imperial Russia, particularly the last generations of the Romanovs and those close to them. Alexander III buffs will be especially pleased to find much material on his life, as well as details about other Romanov relatives, courtiers and clergy. One could be deleriously satisfied with just the hundreds of color plates by themselves as a collection, but the authoritative descriptions and background discussion accompanying them present a profoundly unique and exquisite marriage. Perhaps the most poignant aspect of all, is the element of atonement, evident in the love and respect put into the book and exhibition by the Russian curators, art experts and historians themselves. In short, it is a visual expression of ""Memory Eternal"" to those who lived a lost world."
3,Get if you can't make it to the exhibition,"This is a catalog for an exhibition which runs through Dec. 98 in Wilmington, DE. The exhibition has a fabulous array of 700 letters, documents, diaries, clothing, portraits, and awe-inspiring items such as Faberge Easter eggs, crowns, a coronation coach, and the throne. It vividly illustrates the human side of the family, and these items can usuallly be seen only in Russia, so this book is a good way of seeing relics you might not be able to see otherwise."
5,a treasure trove of documents and personal items...,"...this thing is FULL of photographs...OTMA's childhood drawings, court gowns, letters, diaries...a wonderful opportunity to get 'close' to the Romanovs and the tumultuous times in which they lived and died."
1,Artifact archive only,"This book is strictly an archive of artifacts left by the Imperial family. No text to speak of. Beautifully printed, but pass if you're looking for The Story."
1,Second straight miss for this band,After coming off there first lack luster release Before Everything & After MxPx swings and misses again with PANIC. Poorly recorded and produced it just seems like this band could have done more with this material than they did with this release. Honestly I have heard better recordings from unsigned garage bands than this CD! MxPx is a great band that seems to be around past there time in the spotlight and this album really shows the decline in there music. I don't reccommend this CD but I do reccommend picking up everything before this CD and Before Everything & After.
5,Da Best,"Can it get any Better?Most bands have a great cd and then fall off the Planet-- nooooo... not MXPX , There cd's just keep getting better -- Buy it and i promise you won't regret it!!"
5,MxPx is back!,"After the disappointing Before Everything & After, MxPx has released an amazing cd that reminds why they are the best pop-punk band around today.Panic consists of 14 tracks that are full of that energy and speed that was missing from BEA. Each song is distinguishable from the rest - starting with The Darkest Places all the way to This Weekend.There are several stand out tracks on this disc, but one in particular - The Story - is incredible. Possibly the best song MxPx has ever composed, it will give you goosebumps. The lyrics are powerful, Tom's guitar work is fast and hard, and Mike's vocals are very passionate - something that was also missing from BEA.It is good to see MxPx going back to that harder sound that they were known for back in their Tooth & Nail days.This album is better than even Slowly Going The Way Of The Buffalo, and is giving Life In General a run for its money as the greatest MxPx album ever."
3,A Step in the right Direction,"I'm a fan of MxPx, and have been for a few years now. My first CD was Let it Happen, which i still love. This CD, while no where near as good as Let it Happen, is a step in the right direction. Their last CD Before Everything and After was an attempt to get popular, which no only sucked, but bombed badly. It's good to see that the boys have decided to go back to doing what they do decently....pop punk and not MTV punk. I now have a reason to look forward to their next CD."
2,Boring...,"Not as good as their last effort. What's happened to the lyrics? Certainly not as positive as on their previous releases. I can't believe Christian bookstores even sell this cd. I do own all their albums, but this one is at the bottom of the pile. They haven't done anything decent since ""The Everpassing Moment."" That album was amazing and puts this one to shame."
5,The Koehler Method of Dog Training,"As a dog trainer for more than 17 years, I still feel it necessary to read as much as possible of everything available to keep my knowledge fresh and up-to-date. This particular book is probably considered old school, but there are exercises in this book that I actually use myself when teaching. As long as dog training in fun, firm and fair, you will always have a good experience with your dog, the way training was meant to be taught. The Koehler Method maybe consider and oldie but it's still a goodie."
3,not bad for the times,"The book is not that easy to understand and you really have to slow down or read the chapter twice. There are some chapters that most folks would not find to appealing, such as beat your dog in to submission to get your dog to stop barking,I would opt for modern day electronics,like the tritonics bark collar.The basic obedience part isn't that bad, but is probably misunderstood by the most part. There are other training collars that might be more practical than the choke collar in modern society, but that is my two cents. If you find the book and you think it is a bargain I would buy it, just don't pay to much."
5,Best Training Method,"William Koehler has an excellent reputation as a dog trainer with good reason. After reading this book closely and thoroughly in 1979, I used his technique on my first dog, an intelligent, affable Golden Retriever, with excellent results. The method clearly does not advocate heavy handedness nor excessive punishment, simply making the dog responsible for its actions. I've used the technique on countless dogs since then with consistent, successful results. I've also used the theory in training horses as well, with the results that I have horses who come when they're called, heel and with whom I trust a 2-year-old child. If you want a happy, well-adjusted dog that you feel comfortable taking anywhere in any sort of company, then I heartily recommend this book and training technique."
1,The end does not justify the means...,"Just because it WORKS doesn't mean it's RIGHT. These methods are abusive and inhumane. Save your money and buy anything by Jean Donaldson, Patricia McConnell, Ian Dunbar, Pat Miller, Pamela Reid, or Karen Pryor. Any method is only as good as the trainer using it, and if you have poor timing or inconsistent communication (as most of my dog class participants & all novice trainers do at first) the only damage you do to the dog with motivational, reward-based training, is that it takes longer to train. On the other hand, I am faced with at least one case a month of a fearful dog who was trained with techniques similar to Koehler's that is now dangerously aggressive. Run far, far away from this book. As fast as you can. Please. For the sake of your dog..."
1,Does not work; out of date,"No training method works or doesn't work all the time, but this one comes close. It is old school & often cruel to animals. It is out of print with good reason. Buy it to learn what not to do."
5,Proven Dog Training,"I have tried the ""give your dog a treat"" training methods and have gotten nowhere! Even using Trainers that come to your house. If the dog is in a bad mood or the treats are not tempting enough, or he is full or distracted, the training is useless. I consider that stuff in the domain of ""Show"" competition, not obedience. Using this book as a reference and Tony Anchetta's workbook as a weekly guide, any dog can be ""off leash"" trained and I mean any dog!"
5,The bible of dog training,"This method has stood the test of time and consistently produces happy, confident, dependable working dogs when the method is used properly.I have used this method on tough dogs, on soft dogs, and all measure of dogs inbetween, and it has worked famously with every single one.It's a misnomer that this method is no longer used for compettition dogs. ALL of my competition dogs were trained this way, and I know countless other serious obedience competitors who also rely exclusively on this method.If you are serious about having a well trained and happy, confident working dog, skip all the ""trendy"" training methods, and stick with the one that has worked for 50 years."
1,Harsh!,"I read this book years ago and bought it again when I recently brought my new puppy home. I found this book to be very harsh, loaded with sarcasm, and the author nasty toward other methods of dog training. Furthermore, the author has you running out and spending a lot of money on ""tools"" that are unnecessary. After reading it, I threw it away. It wasn't even worth keeping on my library shelves. My dog was trained ""Dog Whisperer"" style (check out Cesar Milan's book!) and she's a very well trained puppy at 8 months, which just goes to show there's more than one way of doing things and you don't have to be harsh to be effective. I'm a teacher and I've found that it's not just people who grow and learn best with praise and encouragement, it works for dogs too. Skip Koehler, rent the Dog Whisperer video series, buy Cesar Milan's book, and ENJOY your dog! Training doesn't have to be harsh, just consistent."
1,The Sadistic Method of Dog Training,"I checked this book out from my local library and right from the start something smelled offensive - this book. My goodness, I feel the methods in this book of training are not needed.I have read other books and none are like this and none have the problems this author claims you will have. If you care for your dogs well being you will do good to follow other books."
1,Only for those with strong stomachs,"I picked up this book in the library. I consider myself pretty open-minded about dog training.I believe that we can use similar ""corrections"" that a mother dog would use or adult dogs would use with each other and be perfectly OK. I bit of a startle or mild pain is not a bad thing. But, when I got to page 38 where he advocates using a length of washer hose with a wooden dowel in it to strike a dog on the muzzle to correct some biting behaviors, I reached my limit. If you are trying to save yourself from a dog attack, then fine. But, this is supposed to be a correction??Maybe I am just a too tender-hearted person, but there has got to be better ways than this. I have no doubt that done exactly as described, the dog would ""behave"", but only through blind fear! I don't want a dog in that condition!Zero stars is my rating on the part of the book I read...."
2,"good for some dogs, lousy for most","I read this book and took a class with an instructor who used this method ( It was my first dog and didn't know better) By the end of the first class, my dog started to urinate submissivly. However, he did learn his commands. This method might work for a tough type of dog. But do NOT subject a sensitive dog to this, it WILL be counter-productive. It might solve some of your problems, but will create others, like a dog who is terrified of training, who urinates when ordered to stay, fearing a correction (Like mine was)."
5,Great dog obedience book,"I have used the techniques used in this dog obedience book by Koehler.The English Pointer I have been training has been really responsive to each lesson. The dog I am training can be very timid if talked to too harshly. Still, she is very receptive to the Koehler method of training. If this method of training is performed correctly, the dog will respond correctly. I find that most of the time I am the problem and not the dog.I have a cousin that uses this same method and has success.I highly recommend this book to dog owners."
1,ANIMAL ABUSE- DO NOT BUY THESE BOOKS!,"NO WAY, NO HOW. Harsh, cruel methods of dog training are UNNECESSARY and is ANIMAL ABUSE. Read Ceasar Milasn's books (he's known as ""The Dog Whisperer""), to learn kind, effective leadership skills, in order to properly train your dog to do ANYTHING you want him/ her to do. Learning Caesar Milan's ways has helped me teach hundreds of dogs to behave, and become housetrained, loving, mindful companions, eager to please their guardians.The Koehler Method of Dog Training by William R. Koehler IS A WASTE OF TIME, MONEY AND YOU JUST DON'T NEED IT. IT'S ANTQUATED, UNKIND ANIMAL BULLYING. DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,#1 dog trainer of all time.,"I have been training by this method for 37 yrs. Bill Koehler was a great man. I had the oportunity to meet him, when he came to our dog club, also when I took a trip out to California. He and his wife made time to meet with me. They were one of the most sweetest people I had ever met. His methods were also used to train a bunch of Disney's dogs and cats. I can't say enough about him.To sum it all up... there is no better method, than his.This is a must buy for anyone who wants to have an obedient dog. This book even helps solves bad habits, in the back of the book."
1,...but not the method for me and my dog,"I bought this book years ago, and was a bit worried by the harshness of the methods. More recently I found myself working at a kennel where this was THE method, and when I saw it in practice and what it could lead too, I decided I was right to look elsewhere. I'm not anti-choke (training) collar and I'm not against using corrections - I just prefer not choking my dog and I prefer showing my dog what I want, reinforcing goodness with rewards and mistakes with ""oops""."
1,Not for Me,"I don't like the idea of using pain to train pet dogs. It seems that by using some of Koehler's methods you could win the battle, but lose the war;that is, you stop the behavior, but the dog doesn't like you anymore.What point is it to have a pet that doesn't like you or is afraid of you?Does submissive urination make for a better dog? Also, many professional trainers don't recommend painful punishment techniques for beginner dog trainers.Incredibly, this book lacks any discussion of socialization - essential for preventing fear aggression.I also question Koehler's assumption that dogs have evil, vindictive motives.I would recommend ""The Culture Clash"" by Jean Donaldson. She relies on research that studies how animals learn. She also exposes many of the common myths - some of which I used to believe myself."
1,horrid,"I used this book years ago and now it is a shameful memory. he told me to beat my dog with a belt to correct housebreaking mistakes. I did it once. thinking this was the ""right "" way to train. I am shocked this book is still in print. there are so many modern wise books out there. do NOT buy this if you love your dog and want a relationship with him/her that is based on trust and mutual respect."
5,What I expected,Arrived on time as advertised. I find the book an interesting commentary on dog training. So far it has worked wonders with my loveable but stubborn hound.
3,I was required to buy it for a training class,Didn't really like the book but then I have short term memory loss and I found it hard to read and never did use it. I gave it away.
1,"Theres Advanced, Basic and This book - Way To Simple!","This is basically an outline for beginners ONLY. If you expect to be able to move on past simple installation and configuration, save your money! The software Drupal, phpBB and wordpress are all excellent programs. This book is an introduction to each and has nothing to do with building online communities. Way to simple. SORRY!!!"
5,From an actual reviewer,"As a fairly experienced IT Professional who is now entering into the world of web design and deployment, I found this material, particularly the section on phpBB very insightful and helpful in guiding me through the dangers and pitfalls of installation and maintenance. Not only is it well thought out and logically laid out, but it was also written in plain English and not comupter-ese, making it an invaluable aid in implementation. I recommend this book without reservation."
4,Puts things in perspective. Helped me get started,"I downloaded and installed Drupal by myself, but couldn't get much done beyond that. While the online docs provide good reference, its quite scattered, and sometimes assumes prior knowledge.This book lets you take a step back and see the whole picture. Everything is set out right and in a good pace, giving you exactly what you need to know in order to understand the essentials of Drupal.Im a graphic designer, not a programmer, and now I have almost finished building my first Drupal-managed site (for a large clinic), and couldnt have done it without the help of ""Building Online Communities"". I feel that the book gave me strong foundations and confidence to tackle more advanced issues in building my site.Im not using phpBB or WordPress, so I only looked at the other parts of the book breifly. To me, the Drupal section alone was worth the buy."
2,You can't hear it at the race,"No ProsCons: You can't hear this at the race, over half the codes are out of date and dont work , you cant tell who is talking unless you know the voices , ear buds kill your earsI would not buy any product like this again"
4,The Real Deal,"I found this little gem while browsing at a dingy little used record shop a few years back. Cost me maybe $7.00 and worth every penny! The sound quality isn't the best (thus 4 stars), but this is the real deal! Crank this up to full volume and close your eyes. It sounds and feels like being right in middle of some club filled with a rowdy bunch knockin' back the pints. Lots of crowd noise and hollering from the audience (these guys are tanked!). Amps occasionally squelching and Lemmy's usual down to earth sometimes amusing banter in between songs. Occasional tuning up. Great grungey loud rock'n'roll. Most of the first album and some kick ass blues covers (John Mayall's I'm Your Witchdoctor is great!).This isn't for everyone. I'm sure the sound quality and song selection won't suit many a so-called Motorhead fan, but for those who love their first album and want to experience an early gig with no overdubs and genuine live sound, this is a keeper."
4,Vi-vi-vi-vibrator!,"An awesome live album with some of Motorhead's more obscure songs and some cool cover songs, two of which (Motorhead & The Watcher) are by Hawkwind (Lemmy's previous band.) My favorite song here is Vibrator. This is possibly the most aggressive hard rock song I've ever heard. Listen to this song on a sound system with a subwoofer and you'll know what the title means! Sadly, the sound quality is not very good. If it was better, this album would get 5 stars."
1,MIDNIGHT RAIN,This is the first book that I had to make myself read. The plot had to many characters with unfocused messages. For example the striaght girl that helps out gay gals from being raped only at night.After I finished the book I threw it where it belonged. In the Trash.
5,A Great Bible Study!!!!,"This is one of the greatest bible studies for women I have ever encountered. After my group finished Mohney's ""Eve to Esther"" they couldn't wait to begin ""Mary to Lydia"". The author does a terrific job bringing New Testament women into today's world with stories and personal reflections. This study was inspiring, leaving us with a renewed spirit. I have highly recommended this book to other study groups and pass this invitation on to you."
4,Another great read from Elizabeth Alder,"I really wonderfully warm, romantic, slightly mysterious read with great characters. I really enjoyed reading this, and was sad to see it end! I would defiantly recommend this book to everyone."
2,Sap,"This is a sappy, shoddily written romance whose only pleasures are the mouth-watering descriptions of the gourmet dinners and desserts the heroine serves up in her hotel in the south of France."
2,Not her best,I really enjoy Elizabeth Adler's books but this one was a real snooze. The characters were not compelling and it was almost a chore to get through the book. Skip it and get There's Something About St. Tropez instead.
5,I'm trying it by the first time.,"I have been using Glucosamine for a long time now, but in the pill form. I change to the liquid form because I've read that liquid is more easily absorbed by the body. It's still to early to tell but if it is as good as the pill form, I will love it."
5,"Excellent, deep peaceful healing music","This CD has a wonderful mix of vibrational sounds (bowls) and musical overtones (piano and more) that combine to create a deeply peaceful, floating work. Excellent as accompaniment to bodywork."
2,relaxation??,No did not enjoy this. Felt the cadence was disruptive and did not evoke a feeling of compassion at all.
3,Nice ladder but....,"This ladder is fairly lightweight and sturdy, my only complaint is that a rubber gripper on the leg was missing. This was mentioned in a couple of reviews before I purchased this item so there seems to be a pattern here!I wish Amazon had a better system for follow up. I sent an email to Amazon but got no response. I wasn't going to mail back this big package just because it was missing a rubber gripper. If anyone has a suggestion on how I can secure this missing part, I would appreciate the advice."
5,RVers delight--this is for you,"We needed a sturdy ladder to use while washing our RV. This ladder not only filled our expectations, it surpassed them. Very well made and priced at an unbelievabley low price. You could not do better---believe me.Robert"
1,"""Non-remanufactured""","It may have only been a glitch, but the remanufactured Brother multifunction printer didn't work when I received it. I called Brother and talked with a tech there. He could hear the ""groncking"" sound it made when it was turned on... that it wasn't supposed to make. Unfortunately, this was not a happy experience. I opted to return it. The upside is that Amazon customer service handled the return in a fast and easy way."
1,Unreliable printer,"This printer is not reliable. There is an Amazon review that rated it very good because it failed after 2 years of operation. If that is what you expect, then it's fine. After just over 6 months of operation my original new unit started to ask for new ink even though there was more than half left. Sometimes it did this after I had just replaced the ink. After a little more than 1 year of operation it gave a fatal ""cannot init"" error (it was not caused by jam or stuck paper). A quick search notes that this problem is systematic in this unit."
5,Reliable Printer,"This printer is not as fast as others, but it is very reliable. The printing quality is superb. Excellent printer at an excellent price."
2,OK for price,"This is basically an OK printer. I have had trouble with mine. The first one would not print on envelopes (which the guide said it would). Tech support at Brother was not very informed on the model and said it wasn't supposed to print on envelopes. Finally after giving the page number where it said it should, they admitted a problem and replaced it. Now the replacement has broken after a year. It printed well but jams easily and scans well. The copy function is very slow. It is difficult to read the LED screen."
3,Not Ideal for Digital Cameras,"Pros: easy to apply, will keep screen from getting scratched.Cons: makes LCD screen harder to see, creates glare.I purchased this product to protect the LCD screen of my new digital camera from getting scratched. It appears as if it will fulfill this requirement. However, it also makes the screen harder to see. I would not purchase again."
2,Wrong Battery,I bought this battery because the web site recommended to. Turns out this battery does not go with the slinger they recommend it for.I could have returned the battery but it would have cost more than the original cost of the battery.
4,Pulling a lot from British Invasion,"This is a great album - upbeat pop, the likes of which doesn't want to leave your head for a long time after listening (which I personally deem a good thing).If you are familiar with ""The Yardbirds,"" the band that featured Eric Clapton, Jeff Beck, and Jimmy Page before they became famous on their own, then you know what I mean when I say this album creates mystical aura of a Yardbirds song - hard hitting pop licks with a crescendo of lyrics that may sound a tad bit dark on the surface, but really are underscored with a good sense of being and happiness."
5,"Looking for something new,creative, rockin.....","This band is awesome. Their unique sound is refreshing and a great listen. This is one of the few CDs I own that doesn't require any skipping of songs, I can listen all the way through and not notice all the time that goes by. I'm eager to get the next CD, but in the meantime I'm going to suggest that you buy this one. Awesome music folks!"
5,You're crazy if you don't buy this album,"If you were a fan of Spencer Albee while he was with Rustic Overtones you'll have a new found appreciation for what he's doing with Rocktopus. It is...for lack of better words...AMAZING! He really stuck his neck out and tried something new and different. Even if you've never heard Rustic Overtones and have no clue who Spencer Albee is, I Love You! Good Morning! is a fatastic way to get acquainted with him, his new sound, and his bandmates Zach Jones, Pat Hodgkins, and Brian Higgins. The sound they put out together is upbeat, catchy, and, well, fantabulous. It's gauranteed to put a smile on your face."
5,Good product,"Simple to attach and use. If you want your child to practice more often having this attach to their bedroom wall (or where ever they hangout) is a GREAT reminder for them. Much better than a case stashed away which is outta sight, outta mind."
3,Needs to be a little longer,"Sturdy hanger, however, the bow holder or the base needs to be a hair longer. I like to leave myshoulder restattached when I hang up my violin. As such, the rest touches the wall and if I accidentally move the bow, it bangs into the violin. I baby my violin, so I do not use the bow-holder at all now.If this was just about inch longer, it would be the perfect hanger."
3,I was sent yhr wrong item,I ordered the wall hanger version but was sent the music stand version instead.String Swing CC08 Music Stand Violin HangerI fabricated an adapter for wall hanging.
3,Great Product but Terrible Product Fulfillment,"I wanted four of these to hang in my violin studio, and was excited to receive them in the mail - only to have them arrive in two different finishes. Since they were hanging together, I wanted them the same color (light oak, as pictured). Be aware that this is not necessarily the color you will receive. When I attempted to return the one that came in a darker finish to exchange for one in light oak I was told it was not possible to exchange it, but only to get a refund. I ended up returning all four and ordering a matching set from another company.The product itself is great. It looks great on the wall, is easy to install, and is sturdy. But I would not order it from here if you are ordering several and want them to match."
4,String swing is so convenient!,"The string swing was easy to install, attaches solidly to the wall and makes practice easier. I just reach out and start...now if they could have an auto-tuner integrated it would be perfect!"
5,Three Congas,"Bobby Sanabria's ""Getting Started on Congas: Technique for One and Two Drums [VHS]Getting Started on Congas: Technique for One and Two Drums"" is one of the best videos on the market for learning Congas. The reason is, Bobby gives very clear explanation of the rhythms by slowing it down how the pattern is played with good camera shots of the hands. This video is for an advance player already familiar with different Conga strokes, like open, slap, bass and heel toe. You have the Tumbao, Guaguanco, and Bembe broken down by different drum parts in an ensemble situation plus how to play the rhythms on two and three Congas. I was especially impressed with Boby Sanabria's demonstration of how to played the Patato Tumbao and Bembe on three Congas. The Candido interview and performance in itself worth the price of this video. Every Conga drummer should have this video! It's really a shame this is not available on DVD?"
2,Failed to prove her point,"This book is easy to read, but it's not well written. That aside, Book fails to prove her point that what makes female leaders so successful is because of 'unique female' traits. In fact, other than the usually female stereotyped traits of 'compassion, collaboration, and empathy', which men, too, can learn, the other success traits: courage, being a good listener, seeing new opportunities, etc. are not innately female. It's almost insulting to get to the end of the book and see that she has just slapped short shallow bios of female executives, probably the ones who declined an interview with her. The biggest shame of this book is that the women profiled are incredibly admirable for what they've accomplished, but not 'just' because they are women."
2,Why the Best Man for the Job is a Woman,"Save your money! The authors hopelessly biased style and language is a big turn-off. Any useful information is obscured by the overly general ""truths"" about the innate supperiority of women to men. I found this book to be a BIG dissapointment. There are much better books out there that offer similar substance with a more positive and believable tone. Get one of them!"
2,"""I have to make my entrance right now!""","I agree with some of the other reviews; in that, Johnny Depp delivers yet another tour de force performance. And if you're a Depp fan (and I am) then you'll enjoy this movie. If; however, you are not overly enthusiastic about Johnny Depp then you will not have the patience to sit through this movie."
2,All Style. No Substance.,"Because I love Johnny so much I'm going to forgive him for this one. For all of it's fantastic costumes, seedy lighting and controversial subject matter this film was suprisingly bland and painfully slow. I would say it's about 40 minutes too long. I give two stars. One for Johnny and one for Malkovich. Both are fantastic actors and I think they did the best they could with this. It's a shame it's so poorly written because there's so much potential. Great actors and a fascinating subject matter. There's absolutely no chemistry between any of the characters and it's a completely forgettable film. About as interesting as listening to Uncle Ed relive tales of his wild college days."
2,Feh!,"What a thoroughly nasty movie this is. Was that really the intention of those who bear responsibility? What was Johnny Depp thinking? Did I detect a (self-mocking?) hint of Jack Sparrow here and there? I used to think J.D. could do no wrong, which is why I bought this in spite of the negative reviews. Even the sex is about as unerotic as it can get, sort of like the daydreams of particularly repulsive virgin adolescent boys. Is John Malkovich hiding under all that make up? Well he might."
2,"Wow, surprise",Im really astounded by how well this movie has been rated. I love Depp and I thought it was terrible. I think he wanted to do something a bit different and dark but this movie is just sort of pointless. It's about the English restoration and the rebirth of the theatre during a time when sex and murder and general taboo subjects were unacceptable but rampant. It takes the nature of the period to the extreme and was overall terrible. It acted like it was very profound but conveyed very little. It had potential to be an incredible movie but if you're looking for a Depp fix- just pick up something else.
2,"Over-hyped, overestimated, overdone","First of all, let me start by saying that the only reason I didn't give this movie 1 star is because the acting was good. However, without an engaging plot and with the overextended monologues and dialogues, as well as the dreary sets and general lack of beauty except for some very brief scenes, this movie is not in the least bit entertaining. I watched all the way through waiting for something to happen, but nothing really did. To be honest, it's very boring, and not even the very fine Johnny Depp or the touted importance of the subject-matter could save it.Watch it only if you're an insomniac. It might work better for you than Lunesta."
2,Darkness Abounds,"I did not enjoy this movie. The actors were interesting to watch, but the movie as a whole was too dark for me. There was nothing beautiful or light or pretty about the life this film displayed.It showed a dirty, filthy time filled with dirty and filthy people who seemed very selfish in their conquest. Even when the main character wanted to be profound, it lacked something but I'm not sure what.The Libertine was not an enjoyable experience for me. It was dark and a bit empty."
1,"Boring, dark, sad",I found the movie very boring. I fell asleep twice before I could finish the movie. I was very dissapointed because I love Johnny Depp's movies. This one needs to go into the trash and stay there.
1,Discusting,"I would have rated this movie lower, but you didn't have any negative numbers! I love Johnny Depp, but this movie was revolting, discusting and I was terribly disappointed. I'm sure it was accurate for the time period, but depravity is not my cup of tea! Guess I'm a prude."
3,"""I Do Not Want You To Like Me"" ~ A Peculiarly Refined Appetite For Debauchery","'The Libertine' is definitely a movie for highly selective tastes. At times it's witty and highly intellectual while at other times, or should I say most of the time perverse, sordid and depraved. As usual it's another brilliant performance by Johnny Depp and if you're a fan that likes to study the nuances of his roles, a history buff who studies period pieces, or a student of film in general you'll probably want to see this film. On the other hand, if you're just looking for an enjoyable evening of entertainment this is not the movie for you.There are moments of incredible insight and brilliance to be found in 'The Libertine' but I'm not sure if it's worth absorbing all the depressive hopelessness and nihilism in this film to arrive at those few brief and shining moments."
5,The Royal Finger Beckons,"I didn't know what to expect from this movie, but am now more than happy I opted to buy rather than rent since I have watched it twice and will probably do so again in the near future.The day after seeing it the feeling stuck with me. Cold, dark, foggy. For a movie to do that it is well delivered. The musical score ran thru my head the entire next day also.I would have liked more on the actual history of Wilmot ie, his military background, family history etc. But will take the story as delivered.Depp was great. He delivered in my opinion the best of his career to date. ""You will not like me?"" I am sorry but I did. I file this along side my favorites."
5,"A dark, sickening, and depressing masterpiece!","After the long awaited release I have finally seen it. Despite the critics review I found it very interesting and loved Johnny's performance, it is definatly one of his best and darkest roles. Samantha is also very very good and plays the passionate actress better than Jane Eyre any day. If you are grossed out easily I wouldn't suggest this movie, but if you are a hard core Johnny fan suck it up and watch it."
2,really not good,"So very disappointing. Good actors do their part, but this, overall, is just a bad movie. No wonder I never heard of it. Save your money."
4,Charisma with a purpose,"Although this movie did not get very good reviews when it was released in theatres, I happen to think it's one of Depp's best. He's right in character, as usual."
4,Great Film that's Hard to Recommend,"Depp's character begins the film telling us that we will not like him, and spends the rest of the film trying to prove his point. Unfortunately, the lower the chatacter sinks, the more pathetic he becomes. Tour de force performance by Depp (again).This is one of those films that I loved but cannot recommend. It's definitely a matter of taste and temperament whether one would like this film. Even die-hard Depp fans may have some issues, but if you're willing to brave the journey, I don't think you'll be disappointed."
5,I was hypnotized....,"Johnny Depp has gone from obscure guy on 21 jump street to sheer brilliance onscreen. This man is one of the best actors because he takes risks and believes in what he does. I was riveted, and couldn't take my eyes off him for a single second, even when it become hard to look. I wanted to be one the women he was with if just a second. This movie's cinematography is brilliant. It was shot as though you were looking at a colorized silent movie. Dark, ugly at times, but always hypnotic and not easy to forget. This movie is a sheer triumph of what superb acting can do to bring compelling historical figures lives to the masses. See this film!"
2,Luv Johnny ...hate this movie,sorry I love everything I can get my hands on that Johnny Depp has ever worked on. I even dragged my daughter (12) kicking and sceaming to Willy Wonkabut this had to be the worst film!! I was soooo disappointed! with the exception of Depp looking totally HOT (as usual)which is the only reason I gave it a 2the movie was a thumbs downbut that's just me althought I see there are others of like mindI guess you either love it or hate it ....there's not grey area for this onecan't wait for the next Depp film!!!
2,Mud and Poetry,"Lit by candles during overcast weather; almost as muddy as Mel Gibson's Diggervision flicks. And you'd better love 17th-century poetry.For a more interesting version, look up John Wilmot, 2nd earl of Rochester, in Wikipedia, and read it.It's a lot more fun. Although Johnny Depp with a silver nose IS interesting."
1,Denise Adkins,It was stupid. Johnny Depp has done better. I'm not saying he did a bad job it was the premise of the movie which was bad.
4,DVD OF MOVIE LIBERTINE,DEPP AT HIS BEST. HIS CHARACTER IS SO BAD THAT YOU CAN'T STAND HIM. HE PLAYS THIS ROLE SO WELL. GOOD MOVIE THOUGH.
4,Impressive piece of bawdy tragedy,"This is a very entertaining film with great acting. The story is slightly OTT but has some great moments in it, especially between Johnny Depp (a great performance from him) and either John Malkovich or Samantha Morton, who are also outstanding.This story draws you in & in places repels, but it's very entertaining and pretty dark. Recommended.Sherlock Holmes and the Flying Zombie Death Monkeys"
4,Depp Delivers Depth,"True to form, Depp delivers The Libertine facet by spellbinding facet. Set in bewigged 17th Century England, Depp's Earl of Rochester stands out as the real deal among many posers. Emphasizing a connection between the royal court and art which has since faded into decadence, Rochester's well-being relies on how he weilds both his talent and his philosophy. Underneath a choatically cynical and rebellious narcissistic image lies a true passion for both art and romance, used in the classical sense. Malkovich is perfect as the King, and it is a pleasure to see some stars from ""Coupling"" in the cast. Passionate, romantic, poetic, artistic and debauched, this film made me think of nothing so much as the rock 'n roll world."
2,Leave a record?,"THE LIBERTINEa movie starring Johnny Depp, Samantha Morton, John Malkovich & Rosamund Pike about the 2nd Earl of Rochester named John Wilmot. I'm not certain what I think of this one. I enjoyed the sets & costumes & the acting even more so. I'm just not certain why anyone would make a movie about this life.It seemed predictable & basically worthless, requiring no insight whatsoever. Why leave a record of it? The most fantastical part of the movie was that there was skill & talent displayed in it's making, but apparently to no end at all, unless as a mindless machine records history. It was a strange movie-going experience for me. I can't think of a single aspect of the story that is worth repeating."
2,A Grotesque Tour de Force,"Johnny Depp delivers a mesmerizing performance as the debauched John Wilmot, the Second Earl of Rochester in 17th-century England - easily the best thing about this unfortunate, unpleasant adaptation of Stephen Jeffrey's play. Director Laurence Dunmore's irritating music-video technique doesn't help. Standout portrayals by Samantha Morton and John Malkovich prove the ideal match for Depp's inventiveness during this two-hour wallow in the mire."
1,Good acting but awful plot and filming.,The filming was grainy and at times brown tinted probably to give the movie an old feel to it. I thought it hindered this movie which should have been filmed with a brighter lense and without grain. As I believe the grainy filming distracted from the complexities of the costumes and atmosphere.John Depp of course is probably the best actor around these days and he did a great job acting in this movie.The problem with this movie was the plodding plot. The boring and cold relationships with each characters and the lack of action were also other problems. At times the movie was redundant and it dragged on for too long.This movie represents a typical tragic romance with little actual love or lust and a lot of disease and death towards the end. Basically it was hard to feel any sympathy for the characters in this movie.
4,Please enter a title for your review,"An interesting paradox for the period drama fan, is your allegiance to the genre strong enough for the [...] to become defensible even though it's essentially the antithesis of the kind of sensibility you must have like the genre in the first place? If I didn't know better I'd wonder if Dani from Cradle Of Filth had some part in writing or directing this. Honestly though, your average 90s action blockbuster has longer more graphic sex scenes than this film. The majority of the [...] is verbal. Is the John Wilmot character unlikeable? I didn't think so. He sought to be open and honest about who he was and only hurt others when he held them up to the same scrutiny."
4,The Libertine DIM but DAZZLING,"Camera work and lighting were awkward and I had trouble seeing things clearly in this film. Still, I liked the way it set the mood and I understand the director wanted this effect - that everything was lit with candles. It simply was difficult to see the actors at times and sound quality also seemed poor when I saw it in the cinema. I have to reinterate that the director did set the mood appropriately and the murkiness adds to the overall 'dirty feel' of this film. Rochester was obviously a crooked character. Speaking of which, JOHNNY DEPP is dazzling. An amazing actor, he never ceases to amaze me with his talent. The writing is witty and he carries off his lines expertly. The make up work portraying the decaying Rochester is superb. I ordered this on dvd so I can watch it over and over again- there is too much cleverness missed the first time round. This is a fine film and I recommend it, but only for the extremely mature due to the wicked subject matter."
1,Horrible,"This was without a doubt the worst waste of valuable celluloid in the history of moving pictures. The story was boring and nearly non-existent; the allegedly tragic main character (Depp) was unsympathetic and disgusting, and the cinematography screamed ""If I don't put lipstick on this pig no one will kiss it"". Awful."
1,Wish they had a 'no star' option!,"This movie appalled me. I hate even giving it one star, but I have to say that although his character was totally without one redeeming virtue, Johnny Depp is a superb actor. Perhaps that is what the film makers were going for, but I had no feeling for any of the characters. How could you care what happens to these people? He tells you at the beginning of the movie, 'you will not like me.' How I wish I would have listened to the warning and not wasted my couple of hours watching this pus infected piece of garbage, and I hate to see people deceived by the high rating. I have a weakness for the wonderful period piece dramas, but take my word for it, skip this one. I wish I could demand the rental fee from the director personally!"
1,There should be negative star ratings,This movie took too much time from my life and I want it back! One of the worst movies I've ever seen!!
3,Great actor,"The reason I am giving this movie any stars is for Johnny Depp only. It is apparent that he can go into any character and play it very well. No matter what the character is. I didn't really like this movie at all. I was bored and and little disturbed at the plot of the movie. It didn't make much sense to me except that John Wilmont, Johnny Depp's character, didn't really care for anyone except for himself. To really be honest here, he actually liked himself the least of anyone. Johnny's prologue (John Wilmont) was very correct in saying that you will not like him and you will like him even less when you are done seeing the movie. There were a couple of other things about this movie that I didn't like as well. The movie was very grainy in some parts and then clear in other parts. The music was way too loud and you could hardly hear the actors talking. I have mixed feelings about this movie. Use your own judgement if you would like to see it."
4,Great ACTION Book,"This is a great book for teaching action! Full of Scarry's signature characters and detailed illustrations, this book will have your preschooler's motor running for more ""Things That Go"" ! Gotta run!"
3,Okay!,For me this is a book that you read through and put on/in bookshelf. Great as a reference tool!
4,What a life !!!,"At first glance, Germinie Lacerteux is about a middle-age poor maid who lives a miserable life. If it stopped there, it wouldn't be the classic it is. It's not a classic in the strictest sense of the word - it's not just about an unfulfilled love, or the ambitions of the poor, etc. What's so spectacular is the way the Goncourts utilize language to paint Germinie's portrait. Sometimes ridiculous, other times excrutiatingly painful - these are the descriptions of Germinie that we get. There's not the common physical descriptions or superficial personal qualities of a woman. It's a psychological adventure. I am still amazed at how the Goncourts wrote this - without having actually lived Germinie's life. Incredible imagination, I guess. Anyways, if you would like to explore the darker, more profound side of French literature, try this one. It's quite impressive."
5,I love Cerys voice.,"I search for catatonia's music and I buy almost five cd,s from this band, really i love the music from catatonia and Cerys voice is so sweet really i'm in love by these songs, and the seller was the best thank,s."
3,So-So,"The chair looks good and functional in seat area but foot rest doesnt hold up so long, broke after a month of use."
5,One of the best dragon toys I've ever seen...,"This dragon puppet is an absolute must have for anyone who loves dragons. It's really more like a stuffed animal than a puppet, and the detail is exceptional for a plush toy. You won't be disapointed with this one. It's well worth the money."
5,"The ""Papa"" his wife knew....","This biography of an American literature icon is written by the his final wife. She provides an excellent portrait of a master wordsmith. No one can rival the exquisite simplicity of his writing. Papa Hemingway (as anyone who loves Hemingway knew him by) makes the Art of Writing look easy with his simple prose. It is when the simpleton attempts to replicate this act, he (or she) finds the master at work and the difficulty of such a task. Mary Hemingway gives a thorough picture of a Master and how he lived....what he took enjoyment in.."
5,an asset for children,"As a child and adolescent therapist, i have had every client of mine read this. they all love it and it helps them describe their feelings easily."
5,A visual and literary gem!,"My son and I fell in love with this book when he was just 8 weeks old. Now we share the book together with his younger sister. As an educator, I feel this book is a wonderful way to teach children about art through children's literature. The explosive colors and emotional words make this book one of my all-time favorites."
5,Great kid book,"I got this from the library today. When I saw it on the shelf I did not think it was a Dr.Seuss book and almost did not pick thebook up. That just shows you really cannot judge a book by its cover. The pictures in the book look like something children would draw and I think that is part of why my children find it intriguing. The ryming helps the story flow and teaches kids about colors and helps them use colors to relate their feelings.""But when my days are Happy Pink it's great to jump and just not think."""
5,If my toddler could only have one book....,"I bought this book when my daughter was a baby, and have read it to her every night at bedtime for 2 years. At 2 1/2, she tells ME this story now. The illustrations are real enough that my daughter can look at them and identify them, but abstract enough that she realizes each page is about more than a horse or an owl. After a recent trip to the park, she said 'it's a pink day!"" I was just awed by what she's gotten out of this book. I can't recommend it enough."
1,"Disturbing, and boring when it is not disturbing","I tried reading this book to my kid a couple of times, but found it really disturbing. The language is very simple as if the book is aimed at a very young child, but the content is about strong and disturbing emotions. Reading this book to my 2 year old felt inappropriate."
3,My Many Colored Days,"The book is great, but the cover came ripped. I know it's hard to keep it from ripping because of the cutouts but it's discouraging to get a brand new book where the cover is already ripped."
3,A Seuss of a Different Color,"This is a pleasant, quick, lyrical read for young children, but I wouldn't call it a great book. Dr. Seuss has given us plenty of those, so his reputation need not depend on this posthumous publication."
1,"Negative portrayal of ""Black"" and ""Brown"" colors","I was really excited about this book when I first saw it. The artwork is beautiful, with bright and vibrant colors. But then I got to the pages describing black and brown as being low and mad. How could I read this book to my brown/black child? She will already hear messages as she gets older that black and brown are negative. I did not want to start impressing on her these messages at home. I'm disappointed that Seuss would present such negative words for these colors that are used to also describe groups of people. I'm shocked by the insensitivity to issues of diversity, especially as this book was published not so long ago, relative to his other books. Needless to say, I wasn't comfortable reading this book to my child and returned it. A much better book to teach about colors is Brown Bear, Brown BearBrown Bear, Brown Bear, What Do You See?: 40th Anniversary Edition (Brown Bear and Friends)."
2,Why are brown and black bad things?,"My two-year-old daughter does enjoy this book. But as she gets older, I wonder about explaining to her why black and brown have such negative connotations. She's Carribean, you see, and brown herself. Parents with children of color may want to think that through before purchasing this book."
5,Great for kids,"Definitely an awesome book for children. Teaches valuable lessons. I would use it in a classroom if I were a teacher, and I will definitely read it to my kids one day!!"
3,Leaves me wanting,"After several listenings this one still doesn't come together. Yes, these guys are the best in the business and they have done this before (notably with ""It should have happened a long time ago""-perhaps the better outing).They are still better than most at the dreamy weaving of textures and measured freedom this kind of music aspires to, and maybe the short fall here demonstrates how hard that music is to accomplish. Or maybe I just have more late night music than I have late nights. But IMHO, in the clear light of day this comes off as rather astute noodleing that leaves me feeling musically underfed."
1,"Hype aside, it's really inept music","Let me say first of all that I have broadminded eclectic tastes in music and can enjoy many different styles and genres. I have put this Paul Motian CD on the stereo plenty of times, trying hard to appreciate it from SOME angle. To me, in the end, it just sounds like three inept musicians with limited skills. The many positive reviews were written by fans and true believers--good for them. But if this music really were being played ""in the room above ME,"" I'd call the police."
5,a new sonic architecture,"I must own several hundred ECM releases by now. This CD has grown into one of my favorites.Paul Motian is SO much more than a drummer. Mere drummers keep time. Motian, by contrast, communicates timelessness.Motian is the Creator of Space; Lovano is the king of tone; and Frisell adds color and imagination. The trio together explores adventurous territory with great intuition and sensitivity.If you're looking for a new sonic architecture with an urbane, urban edge, this is it.An outstanding offering from three of the most brilliant, imaginative, and mature musicians of our day."
3,Plasticity,"For those who want to study hard the beyond-elastic-limit behavior of the materials, this book is a good choice. After an introduction to tensorial mathematics and Einstein's indicial notation, the plastic models are presented to the reader. On its first part, it is presented a general theory of plasticity for any kind of materials as metals, rocks, soils and concretes. Several examples of practical applications are given. On the second part, the study is concerned on metal plasticity and a numerical finite element approach is presented. The theory presented in this book is very complete and deeply explained, but the language in many parts is bit confuse, which makes the study more difficult. If you are looking for an introductory reading, it could be a good idea to try ""Continuum Theory of Plasticity"", by Akhtar S. Khan. This other one has a simpler language and more usual mathematical notation."
5,punkrock at its best,"""Wakey Wakey"" was my first cd I bought from The Toy Dolls and is really rockin'! The lyrics are funny, and the British accent makes it unique. I promise you you won't sit still listening to this cd. If you like The Toy Dolls, get ""Idle Gossip"" too, you won't regret it!!"
2,snapped bit,The 5/64th bit sheared at the base after about 10 holes. The 3/32nd bit worked fine for about 50. I don't think I'd buy them again.
3,Drill Bit Set,"It is okay for the money even though I have to say the smallest bit already broke, it broke the first time used. I am hoping the rest of the bits hold up longer. You get what you pay for but if you only use these once in awhile it would be worth buying."
2,bits are nice,"the bits fall out of the quick disconnects or just spin around, but the bits are very good and sharp."
5,Quick change drill bits!!,"Small set of quick change bases bits, have used several of them and they are GREAT, good quality and good price for this set of bits, others will enjoy these as well!!!"
2,Drill bit bend?,"In over 50 years I have shattered many drill bits or just outright broken them. This is the first drill bit ( the 1/8"") I have ever bent! I guess you get what you pay for."
3,Well it looks like the good ones,"I bought a set of drill bits but two quickly broken. In search for replacement, this one is claimed to have titanium and looks exactly the same as the one I used.The price is good, but one of the bit broke the first time I used it! Maybe I am a superman at last that breaks bits. However another aspect I can't tolerate is the slow cutting speed when drill. Somehow the head was not designed correctly or something, it feels very dull."
1,Bits out of true,"I used the bits for the first time this weekend and found 25% of the bits were out of true.I thought I'd save a few dollars in buying these over the trusted Mikita product and have paid the price.Next time, buy it once not twice."
3,Was able to drill through steel,"Recently used it to drill through steel. It took a long while and they wobble, a lot! Was afraid of breakage."
4,drill set,"bought for the specific reason of hex drive, good variety of bit sizes and bit length. good general purpose set and price was right"
4,Snappy Bit set!,"Great drill bit set. I climb roofs to service solar P/V panels. Try to carry two battery drills (regular and impact) and every trip up the ladder the tool bag gets too heavy to lift! Got rid of the drill and just use the impact. ThesE bits fit great. Price is right for the set which is cheaper than regular bits. Though people will say the impact drill should not be used for drilling. It does work with these bits. I will admit to snapping the 1/4th inch drill bit in a 12 VDC Rockwell impact drill RK2512K(smallest one on Amazon.com) To drill pilot holes in a roof for 8"" lag bolts to mount Uni-Strut. Less weight and handy rubber holder = a great tool!"
4,Lectures on Homeopathic Philosophy,"Step by step, lecture by lecture, Kent takes the reader through to a deeper understanding of Hahnemann's principles of Homeopathy. These are lectures Kent gave and they were compiled by his students. Excellent material for the beginning student or the practicing Homeopath."
4,Classy and Versatile Watch,"This watch is not only nice to look at, but can be worn in AF uniform in in civilian clothes. Fossil offers great style with the silver band and black face. It is comfortable to wear too. My husband is picky about watches, but he has really enjoyed wearing this one. The band is very smooth and doesn't cause any irritation that other watches have caused."
5,My BF loved it!,"I bought this watch for my BF's birthday and he really liked it. Yes, it's a bit heavy but it looks so classy and nice."
3,1940's Batmobile roadster,"Good detail, good metal construction, but not a toy for playing with. This is definately a collector's item, not for your 5 year old. It's amazing to be able to chart the evolution of the Batmobile from it's early 1900's origin, to the latest incarnation."
5,"GREAT book! and great condition, thanks","This book is so good. God led me through understanding healing, and even through inner healing as I read this book. I found my spiritual experiences paralleling the instructions in this book; head knowledge turned into heart experiences. What a journey!"
3,Disappointed,"The content of the book is good. However, the condition was a disappointment. At least 40 pages are heavily marked and comments written in the margins. This does not add enjoyment to the study of the material!"
5,Funniest strip to come along in awhile.,"I first saw this comic strip in 1993 and couldn't get enough of it. The characters are unique, the humor wry, and the situations delightful albeit strange. I was thrilled to find the first book, Overboard, and am hoping Mr. Dunham will produce more. What a kick it was when earlier this year when I discovered his daily and Sunday strip in a paper in San Jose, California. Maybe a book is not far behind. Lets hope so."
1,this thing sucked!!!,"this ipod charger is garbage!!! i plugged it in one time and it broke!! The first time it worked great,then i went to charge my ipod and it didn't work!! Si i took it apart to maybe see what happened and it had overheated!! i recomend not to buy this product!! thank you!! :)"
4,Cheap and convenient,I think the title of the review says it all. I guess the only thing is that there's no way to tell how long you need to keep it charged. I just plug it in and walk away for a few hours and it was done.
1,Never recieved,"I never received this product. I had called an left a message to change my address, before it shipped, and no one ever called me back."
2,"Hawkwind - 'Acid Daze,Volume 1' (Receiver)","When I first got my copy of this disc,I guess I was maybe 'sort of' thrilled mostly because it was,I believe my 8th Hawkwind disc I ever bought.I was a tad blown away,at first by the cover,but seeing that it was,in fact an import I went ahead and bought it on the count that it was low-priced.True,it is pretty much a second rate compilation and it certainly IS cutting-room floor material.Maybe I just liked having a slightly different version of the tracks ""Space Is Deep"",""You Shouldn't Do That"" and ""Silver Machine"".You Hawkfans KNOW what I'm talking about,with the way that Hawkwind sometimes has like up to ten(10)different versions of certain songs.For die-hards(hee-hee Beavis,you said 'hard')ONLY."
2,Doesn't really stick well,I bought this for a Sony H1 camera. This camera has a LCD size of 2.5 inches so none of the presized lines on the back could help me. Where others could get 12 films out of it I can only get three. My first one got a piece of dirt on it and it ruined my field of sight. The second is not sticking to the bottom. I have a very snug camera bag and everytime I pull the camera out or place it in it rubs the film. I've only had it on a couple of hours and the bottom is already curling off. I've taped it for now but needless to say I'm still in the market for some type of protection for the LCD screen. It's inexpensive but you get what you pay for.
1,Terrible item,This product is poorly made. The actual laminate is hard to see through. It does not adhere to the glass without having bubbles. I do not reccomend.
3,"Cheap, but doesn't work for everything","This worked fine on the back of my digital camera (had to be trimmed per manufacturer's instructions), but wouldn't stick to the surface of my GPS."
1,NOT A 12 PACK,"I purchased this thinking I was getting 12 full size sheets! When it arrived I found that, because they plan on having you cut down the sheets, they feel the 3 sheets you get are the same as 12 protectors. NOWHERE in the description do they tell you that there are only 3. I think this is a very misleading description of the product. I guess I should have realized the price was just to good to be true! I would recommend this product instead:Fellowes Universal Screen Protectors 9000201"
2,It's better than nothing.,These sheets to cover the lcd are extremely flimsy and also quite difficult to place exactly as wanted on the screen. They're cheap and that's the extent of their value.
1,Stay away!!!,"So you know, these are not permanent. Not even semi-permanent. There is no adhesive, you have to wash the screen with windex, etc then stick the 'protector' on. This may be quasi-ok for glass screens, but matte screens like on my camcorder it is a miserable failure. I put one on my Canon a710, put it in my camera bag and 20 minutes later when I went to get it out the protector was halfway off. Don't bother with this product. And to be clear you don't get 13 protectors, you get 3 large sheets, a wet towelette to moisten a dry one to clean with and a squeegee to get air bubbles out. Too bad they didn't include a product that worked."
2,"Good, but not permanent","First, you won't get 12 screen protectors. You will get three lousy screen protectors, that, if your screen is REALLY small (about 2""), will be cut into small pieces that may give 12 screen protectors. They come off really easy, they are exactly as the screen protectors that came attached to your cell phone screen, or your wrist watch, or whatever needs some protection, but no, they are definitely not permanent. For the price I can give'em two starts, but I would strongly recommend Fellowes screen protectors over these."
3,screen protectors,"The words ""12 pack"" are a little misleading. There are only 3 or 4 screen protectors - if you cut them up into smaller ones, you can get 12, but there aren't 12 full-size protectors. Still, they work well."
4,insanely easy to apply,"i just bought the protectors so i don't know how long they will last (doesn't really matter though b/c they give you enough to replace old ones). after reading other reviews i expected to have a really tough time applying it. however, it is possibly THE EASIEST THING I HAVE EVER DONE. i just can't understand how it can be difficult. my screen is 3"" and is not one of the recommended sizes. i simply lined up the sheet of covering with the edges of the screens and drew lines. it fits perfectly...easy as pie. this product is very worth the $3 i spent on it"
2,"Poor quality, frustrating to use","First off, these screen protectors are practically obsolete because modern camera screens can be twice the size of the template sizes; one must draw by hand the correct size. Upgrading the templates of these would save half the work. And, after I finally got the right size applied bubble-free, I gently slid my camera back into the case only to find that the screen protector had peeled off in the process and lint from the plush inside of the case was now stuck all over the exposed plastic. Not only that, but these plastic protectors scratch easily. Personally, I have bought so many of these things that I have decided to go without a protector and be extra careful. I suggest you do the same."
3,Better than nothing,"The only thing good about this is its price. You better have a lot of patience and real good with a pair of scissor because it is not easy to cut the exact piece of film for your digital camera screen. Be reall careful when you put the film on, it can be scratched very easy and the bubble on it is very difficult to get rid of. It is almost like putting a tint film on your car window. It is also no way the box can provide up to 12 films unless you have a tiny little bit digital camera. You may be better off to buy precut film made for your camera."
5,Does What it's Supposed To!,"I use this to protect the screen on my new Kodak digitial camera (V550) with it's large 2-1/2"" screen. It was very easy to cut to size and looks great on the screen. A small investment to protect a great screen!"
5,Easy to use,This product is inexpensive and easy to use. It is a film that clings to the LCD monitor to prevent scratches. I put one on right after I got the camera for Christmas and it is still doing fine.
3,Good for the price,This is not much spl but it worth the price when it is compared to others...May be a good choice if u want to protect ur electronics that has a display...
3,Digital Screen Protectors,"The protectors pretty much try do the job in the same way the original cover that came with the camera did. You have to cut to fit, make sure the screen is clean and lay it on. If you don't have it on right the 1st time, it's easy to pull off & reset, but doesn't adhere for as long as if left alone & bubbles occur after the fact. Can be difficult to separate from the paper, but not insurmountedly. There are several in the kit, but a little less than what I expected for some reason and seems to be thinner than the original but figure better than nothing."
4,So Far So Good,"It was easy to apply, everything you need to apply. Holding up well so far. I like this better than an actual physical contraption added to the back."
2,"Good idea, needs improvement",I ueed these screen protectors on both my digital camera screens and on my 2 GPS units and my cell phones. The problem is they all have air bubbles under them. I tryed to work them out with the supplied squegie and by re-installing them but a few air pockets remain. It makes the screen look bad.
1,Not for cameras with larger screens,"I purchased this product to go along with my Canon Powershot SD550. It looked easy enough to apply at first. There were nice little lines drawn on the screen protector, showing you where to cut for certain screen dimensions. However, 2.5"", the size of the SD550's screen, was not one of them. The premeasured lines only go up to 2.2"".You can try to wing it and measure the old-fashioned way, but if you're off a hair, it won't fit the screen, and the corners of the proctector will annoyingly begin to peel back.I'm sure this works fine for cameras with smaller screens, but it would have been nice if the product descrption could have mentioned screen size limitations."
2,Not recommended,"I bought these because of the price and supposedly you get ""12"" for such a low price. Three things you should know about them.1) You don't get 12, you only get 3. On the back of each sheet, is a template that helps you cut each sheet into 4 smaller sheets, hence the ""12"". But no camera made today could use such a tiny size sheet if you cut it. You can probably get 6 sheets though if you cut them in half. The actual dimension of each sheet is 3 1/8"" x 3 7/8"".2) These use a glue of some kind to stick them to your screen. It looks fine when you put it on, but I hope I can remove this glue at a later date when I need to replace the protector. And I hope it doesn't damage the screen. I will look for a ""static"" kind or protector next time.3) These protectors are fairly reflective. I put one on a GPS in my car and I can hardly see the screen anymore on a sunny day. I would definitely recommend an anti-glare protector.Hope this helps someone..."
5,Good for its purpose,"I bought these for a Canon digital camera. Seller offered to cut these to the size of my camera's LCD, but I was unable to find the exact dimensions, so I was sent a few uncut protective films, and did the cutting myself. Worked like a charm--I put one of these puppies on my camera, and now it feels protected, and doesn't materially change the clarity of the LCD. No glue or anything needed to make it stick, it just does, and well.All in all, I'm glad I made the purchase to protect my investment."
1,COMMON SENSE SOLUTION...,"After trying this product and being completly unsatisfied with it after finding all the faults listed in past reviews I decided to try a little experiment.First I measured the LCD screen on my Canon Digital Rebel XTi with a ruler and mapped them out on a piece of paper. Then (on the same piece of paper) I drew the dimensions of the LCD screen so I had a drawn out square the exact size of my screen.Next I took a piece of Glad Cling Wrap and laid it down over the square on the piece of paper. After taping it down so it couldn't move, I used a picture (rotary) trimmer to cut out the saran wrap laid over the paper square.I then had a perfectly sized protective sheet for my LCD. I simply laid the saran wrap over the screen and had a better protector then the Digital Concepts product. And it was free."
1,Buyer Beware!! Caveat Emptor!!!,"1. Digital Concepts (12) pack is really a 3 pack, the (12) is a come-on. There are 3 distinct pages which can be cut into/upto 12 tiny protectors!2. Also, Ace Digital sent me ""Vidpro"" not ""Digitial Concepts"". They said they would send me the Digital Concepts after I first returned the Vidpro. Ay that point the only business making money on this was the USPS.Bummer,0-)"
2,Not Too Great!,"I wasn't really expecting the screen protectors to be of great quality considering the price. But I needed something to at least get by. They do the job I suppose, but could be much clearer and sturdy."
3,So-So...,"...as reflected by the three stars. It's thin sheets of film that you cut for your camera's LCD screen. While it protects from scratching, that's about all it does. If you own any of the SD series by Canon, you're better off getting a 'da Protector screen...uh..protector. It's a hard, very clear 1/16th of an inch thick acrylic that, when applied to your camera, ""floats"" over your LCD (it sits on the edge around the screen). When I received the 'da Protector, I peeled this one off and tossed it out. I also agree with the reviewer who said the colors were a little changed."
4,does the job,"well, it's a drain stopper. it plugs the drain so we can fill the sink up with water. it does this well. after a few uses though, grabbing the metal ring on the top to remove the stopper from the drain will tear the rubber at the top and the ring will come off. this makes it a little annoying to remove, but it still plugs the drain."
2,too much aerobics not enough abs,"FAST FORWARD!!!the first half of the tape is nothing but annoying aerobics that are too fast to follow easily. if they MUST put aerobics on every single tape, why not at the end?the ab & chest part is okay. i use this tape about once or twice a week, along with get the kathy ireland abs/buns/thighs tape.i think the ab & chest part should have been more the focus of this tape, it seems like an afterthought. if you're looking for no nonsense ab work, get the Kathy Ireland body specifics tape."
3,A whim,This book was an impulse buy for a friend. She let me read it. It was cute and had some funny moments; I have no desire to own it though.It's great for the Gravatation fan. It exspands on the story between the two main charactors.
4,Rae Spit That Fire!,"Rae is back to blaze us wit the hotness once again. I thought his second album was mad wack. I haven't heard some real hip hop in a while, especially with all this Hip-Pop that is out now. We need some NY Gangsta hits and Rae is the man to bring it back to the real! All tracks work except Ice Cream II (try again). It is a worthwhile purchase!"
4,A step up from his previous album,"First off, this is not Rae's best work, not that he was ever going to be able to top Cuban Linx. That being said, this album is better than the widely hated Immobilarity. I happened to like Immobilarity for what it was, an album with poor production and awesome lyrics. This album is basically the same but with better production. Personally, I think Chef would be better off using more RZA produced tracks and featuring more Clan guest spots and less of his crew, which sound out of place alongside him. If you didn't like Immobilarity, you probably won't like this. However, if you are a fan of Raekwon, you would be wise to at least give this one a listen."
3,good album,the chef is cooking on this one. he has better albums and verses but this album nevertheless is still a great one!
3,3 Stars,"The Lex Diamond Story is AVERAGE hip hop, but shows that Raekwon can not let go of trying to remake Only Built 4 Cuban Linx. Overall it's a pretty good album."
4,the story of Lex Diamons,"The Chef has done it once again putting hot beats with furious lyrics it's just what hip-hop is. Raekwon has proved himself once agian adding to his 5 mic classic Only built for Cuban Linx, to his slammin' album Immobilarity to Lex Diamond Story. Songs are off da chain like Pa-blow Escablow, King of Kings w/ Havoc,Clientele Kid, Wyld in da club. Tghis album is a defenite must have it is worth the $13 Raekwon is a lyrical genius along with his fellow wu-fam but this album is salmmin'go and get the album and bump tha f*ck outta your car with this album."
1,THIS SUCKS!!!!!!,"I'M A WU-TANG FANATIC BUT THE WAY THEY ARE GOING, IT'S GOING DOWN HILL:RAE'S JOINT A 2,GHOST'S BPW 2,AND METH'S JOINT WHEN EVER IT DROPS BECAUSE OF PRODUCTION IS PROBALY GOING TO BE A 1.I ASK ONE ? WHY CAN'T THEY JUST USE THE OLD FORMULA WITH A NEW TWIST(SIMPLE)!ONLY IF WE COULD GO BACK TO 89'......................................HIP HOP IS DEAD!!!!!!!"
2,Gabbage...Str8t GABBAGE...not garbage but GABBAGE!!!,"What happened hear...Immobilarity was bad enough but at least his verses were straight. Now in this joint his verses are short, good but so short I dont care how good they can ever be. Every good joint has long verses to keep it real but this is pure mainstream. All I can say is that Hip Hop...they dont make it like they used to. Rest in peace Hip Hop, too early to mourn? too late to rise? Well see in time but who cares its so terrible. This Cd deserves a 1 but I love WC and must give more."
5,"4.8 stars, Pretty Tight","In 2003, too many rappers went pop, with overuse of club and sex anthems with whack bubblegum pop beats. ""The Lex Diamond Story"" is different. Raekwon has some nice beats, a few even reminiscent of the older school mid 90's New York beats like ""Clientele Kidd"" and ""Pa Blow Escablow"". He does not go too pop. He does go ""Wyld in Da Club,"" but doesn't overdo it. While his hard core raps like in ""King of Kings,"" ""Clientele Kidd,"" and others are not groundbreaking because gangsta rap has been around for so long, but he executes the songs well. His music sounds more like rap as opposed to pop! I have to give him mad props for that. If you love pop-rap, this one may not be for you; if you love classic rap, this one is definitely for you."
5,Great book for all,This book gives you the very best learners guide and reference book I've ever seen.
4,The Right Size,Finally have found an easy way to replace worn heads. They have been so hard to find in the national chain drugstores....a cinch now!!
1,"A waste of time/$$, not sure if it was manufactured differently but both broke in 1.5 month","Sonicare is our trusted brand for decade, but both Replacement Brush Heads broke (inside metal arm broke and no longer vibrate) in 1.5 month of usage. We used Replacement Brush Heads before and never had a broken head except for worn brush. These suppose to last at least 5 months. We thought something we did, but the second broke right after replacement. They do look flimsy. Don't think we'll order this product online again."
5,Actually better than the generic brands!,"Like many others, I had fallen in the habit of buying the less expensive replacement heads, thinking there couldn't be that much of a difference. After reading other reviews here, I decided to splurge and give the ""real deal"" another try and can now say I will never go back to the off-brands. As others have mentioned, there is a surprising difference in the way the heads made for the Sonicare vibrate at a seemingly higher frequency than the knock-off versions. Considering you only need to replace the head about 1x a month, seems better to spend a few more dollars to maximize the benefits of the toothbrush and get the best results possible. Here's hoping it pays off in savings at the dentist!"
4,Philips Sonicare,"I like the replacment brushes, unfortunately, I did not understand what the compact heads were and then received them and realized they were child size. I am using them anyway and will know better next time that I need the standard size for an adault."
5,Best electric dental brush available.,My dentist gave me the Sonicare system as part of a dental repair that I had done. I would not have purchased such an expensive brush on my own. But now that I have it I am very pleased. It is recommended that the brush head be replaced every three months. And with the Amazon subcription discount makes this an even better deal.
4,great if you keep the charger handy,I think this brushhead does the job well in under 2 minutes. The instructions on the brush actually tell you to go more than two minutes for the top of the mollars. I recommend this brushhead to anyone switching from mannual to electric.One thing. Make sure you charge it fully at least once every three days or you will notice the difference in the power of the tool
5,This is GREAT,I didn't even realize that my old brushes were geting worn out. I just replaced them because Sonicare recomends it. After replaceing them I noticed the differance instantly. My Teeth feel much cleaner.
5,"Sonicare E-Series replacement brush head, 2 pack",I am very happy with these brush heads. I bought a sonicare 5300 Essence power toothbrush. It came with only one brush head and I needed 2. So I bought the 2 pack and now have 3.Now I have a spare when one of the two wears out. I do wish Amazon sold them in singles.
4,Philips Sonicare Elite Brush Heads are the most effective and fairly priced replacement brush heads that I have found.,"I have used the Philips Sonicare Elite Replacement Brush Heads for several years. In the past, through my independent business, I had been able to receive orders as needed. Once this product was no longer available through my business, I had to search for the proper replacements. I tried some other products but I discovered that those products were inferior and costly since I needed to replace them more frequently.I am most satisfied to have the Philips brand available through Amazon and I will continue to order my replacements on an as needed basis."
4,Fits Advance Model,These brushes work better than the original brush for the Advance model Sonicare brush. I like the angle and can reach my back teeth easier than before.
3,just like everything else,"it appears the brush heads have become smaller. Is it any wonder? Almost every other manufacturer is giving you less these days. Just look at the cans of tuna fish, boxes of cereal, cans of coffee, etc. They raise the prices and reduce the quantity of what they are selling. However, the brush works, just covers a smaller area on your teeth."
5,Good price,"My dentist recommended the Philips toothbrush, and my first one gave many years of service before it had to be replaced. Am on third set of replacement heads for this one and am quite happy with performance.Started out to buy the replacement brushes from the manufacturer. Amazon's price and shipping costs were lower."
5,good enough,what can can be said ... except if you need it ... gotta get it and buying it through Amazon beats driving around looking for them. And getting this great product is a no brainer when its for the best rechargable toothbrush - the Philips Sonicare.
3,Good but expensive,"I wouldn't buy any other replacement heads, but it gets a little expensive after a while. They don't last me close to 3 months like they are supposed to. I'll be lucky if they last 2 months each. Besides that, I do like these replacement brush heads."
2,Lost it's quality...BOO!,"This last order was such a dissapointment. Both heads started to shred and have long unfolding strands start popping out within the first few uses. Already worn down after three weeks. Not a all like the old, better quality in the past."
5,Found at last,I was happy to find this product on your site after searching in 4 stores in town. I should have started here I guess. Many newer models were available on the store shelves...NOT the older ones. They came very quickly and were immediately put into use! Thanks
4,everyone is trying to make some money...,"product is good. shipped quickly. the only thing that bothered me is that before, the brushes needed to be changed every 6 months. now the label says to change it every 3 months.... i just think they're trying to make money, but who isn't. besides that, like the brushes"
3,ok,Ok but overpriced brush refills. Philips needs to lower their prices on these refills as the cost too much and you have to replace too often.
4,They do the trick,"I like using the Sonicare products so when it was time for new brush heads, I ordered online, rather then having to drive all over Tucson to try to find a set for the unit I have. They arrived in good condition in the time promised, nothing special to say, if you need replacement heads and don't like spending your weekends hunting them down at a good price, the internet's the way to go."
3,the product needs to be redesigned,The product needs a new design as the gunk gets into the grooves of the screw of the thread of the brush handle and inside. Poor design and still not possible to change recharge battery by consumer.
4,The trick is....,"The trick with this toothbrush is, before you use it for the first time, to seal the inside of the body cavity (that the brush screws into) with silicone grease or other type of sealant to keep any moisture from entering the electronics. I've never had the water leakage problem that other reviewers refer to, and I believe it is because I sealed mine. I also used a light coat of silicone on the battery terminals to minimize possible corrosion. In Hawaii anything with batteries corrodes eventually. If you take these precautions it will last a long time and work well. I also recommend rechargeable NiMH batteries. All things considered I'm very happy with mine."
4,"Work fine, but wear out quickly","These heads do a good job of cleaning, but they wear out much faster than the previous straight head design. The older style heads lasted about 6 months, the new rippled ones only 2 or 3 months."
3,Careful,Amazon no longer provides the best available price on the market for two replacement toothbrush heads for the Elite series of Sonicare electric toothbrush. A refill makes the toothbrush run like new. But you can get refills much cheaper elsewhere.
3,Elite Brush,"My Dentist told me to use this. I have never had a cavity in my 40 year life, and I got a small one after using this brush for 6 months. I am certain there is a great reason to brush your teeth for 2 minutes, so I still use it. Juust make sure you aren't missing a spot and get into a thorough routine rotating the undulatiing round brush throughout your mouth."
1,AMAZON PERFORMANCE REVIEW- MY PRODUCT,"TWICE THIS YEAR I HAVE RECEIVED DOUBLE SHIPMENTS OF THE PRODUCT AND HAVE TRIED REPEADTEDLY TO RETURN ONE OF THEM BUT COULD NOT DO SO. PLEASE CANCEL MY MEMBERSHIP IN THE AMAZON AUTO RE-ORDER PROGRAM IMMEDIATELY. IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO CONTACT AMAZON BY PHONE OR EMAIL TO CORRECT AN ERROR.Philips Sonicare Advance (A-Series) Replacement Brush Head, Standard (2-Pack)"
2,Sonicare Buy 2 Get 1 Free Brush Head Offer,"Beware of Sonicare's Buy 2 Get 1 Free Brush Head Offer. I bought 2 Sonicare brush heads and sent the original UPC symbol to Sonicare. They sent me a postcard stating that it did not receive the original UPC symbol or proof-of-purchase tab.Although the Sonicare brush is okay, I definitely would not buy another Sonicare product again based on the company's incorrect handling of its promotion offer!"
3,Replacement Heads,Brought a new replacement toothbrush and ordered addtional brush heads for use. I could not beat the price of the replacement heads.
4,Product as described,Love my sonicare. I was glad to be able to find this product so easily and avoid paying the ridiculous prices in brick and mortar stores.
4,These are the genuine article . . .,Yup . . . . these are the real deal . . .cheaper and much more convenient than buying at the big retailers . . . recommended by my dentist . . .I still have all my teeth!
4,Only way for clean teeth!!!,I only use the Phillips SonicCare toothbrush and brushes.I brush my teeth 2x a day and it keeps my gums in good condition.
5,Brand new and great price,These are brand new brushheads and they were cheap so I gave them 5 stars. I dont care where they came from.
3,Replacement toothbrushes,"The replacement brush's are ok, but they don't fit like the originals that came with the Sonicare Brush. Our brush unit is about 3 years old and the brushes just don't fit as comfortabley as the originals and the fist few replacements. They seem to clean just as well. So I can't really complain."
5,great buy,This is a great buy if you go and check the market place. I am recieving this on an auto buy system. Every 3 months. Reminds me and it was a wonderful price.
4,Expensive Toothbrush... Worth it?,"This toothbrush is really good. I have some gum rescission that I am hoping will be halted or reversed. I will see. Have been using the brush for about 3 months now. It cleans VERY well and seems pretty gentle, although it feels like you have a wasp in your mouth. It lasts very long out of the charger (at least 3 weeks) so trips are possible without the induction charger (no wires attached.One of the hardest things is finding the correct heads. Philips uses BIZARRE numbering system that doesn't match up with base. I had to check 2 sites to see if these were OK.You can buy a LOT of conventional toothbrushes for $30 !"
2,Hard bristles,"I am disappointed with the Hx700L/30 E-series toothbrush replacement heads from Amazon delivered to me on November 26, 2011. I don't find the bristles as soft as the other E-series replacement heads purchased by me. As a matter of fact the new bristles are so hard that my dentist informed me that I was brushing my gums away:( The problem is that since the brush heads should be replaced every 3 months I ordered this item as a repeat order. I don't know why these brush heads are so different and what to expect from the next order. If the future brush heads bristles are of the same quality, please cancel my order.Thank you."
2,"Brush head is too small, almost like a child size","The brush head is too small, almost like a child size. The product description does not state that prior to purchase."
4,Very slow shipping,"I ordered the brushes since they are about $5-6 cheaper on amazon than at a store. However, it took a week for them to arrive. They didn't even ship until the expected arrival date. Definately not worth waiting a week to save $5.The brushes also come in a generic brown cardboard box, not the actual Sonicare package."
3,They're toothbrushes.,"I like the compact heads over the full-sized ones because they allow me to more easily maneuver and clean my back teeth, and to focus on one tooth at a time, which is what my dentist has recommended due to my gum recession."
5,Toothbrushes,These toothbrushes fit easily into the Phillips Sonicare Electric Toothbrush. I have no trouble removing the old toothbrush and putting in the new one. It takes just seconds.
5,Sonicare,I got a really good deal on these Sonicare repplacement heads. The price I paid was less than I have ever seen them anywhere! Go Amazon!
3,Phillips E-Brush Heads at Fair Price,"The pharmacies and larger outlets near my home have stopped carrying Sonicare products for unknown reasons. I was relieved to discover that I could order replacement toothbrush heads from Amazon at a decent price and with speedy delivery. Since I use the Sonicare toothbrush on the recommendation of my dentist, I was relieved that I could continue to do so without an interruption in my dental hygiene regimen."
2,"4 star product, -2 stars for annoying packaging",The only complaint I have with the brushes is that they don't always prevent moisture from seeping into the screw-on assembly part of the brush. That results in mildew and goop building up in the base of the brush assembly even after rinsing. It basically makes cleaning a bit harder.The annoying clamshell packaging does not have any perforations to open it easily so you must use a box cutter to open it which is somewhat irritating.
4,Firmer than I expected,"They really get the job done, but I had to revert to ""beginner"" mode because the bristles are firmer than I am used to and I had a little bleeding at first. OK now. I haven't had them long enough to report on dentist results."
4,wonderbar,The sonicare product arrived quicker than I expected and was exactly what I expected. The product itself is marvelous because it assists one in brushing more thoroughly than one would normally do. It also leaves the mouth feeling clean and refreshed due to the gentle stimulation. I would recommend this product to anyone.
5,Sonic Care Toothbrush,The best toothbrush I've ever used. Recommended by my dentist. First time in my life my teeth really felt clean after brushing.
3,It would be nice to have different colors,"The Sonicare brush works great, but why do they have to make all the brushes look nearly the same? My Wife and I can't tell them apart. It's always my fault when they get mixed up."
4,sonic care elite,These replacement heads only last 4-6 weeks not 6 months. Longer use the bristles are too worn & it exhibits too much bacteria. The way these brushes clean is impeccable. The only drawback is they're quite expensive.
4,Sonicare Elite Replacement Brush E-Series,Intense vibration takes a little getting used to - but your teeth will feel clean!I typically alternate with regular toothbrush.
5,Love this product,"I always feel I'm getting a great value when I order these brush heads. Being on Subscribe & Save, I don't ever have to worry about not having a back up."
4,"great replacement, better than the loud generic ones from tar-zhay","I needed some replacements a while back and bought some cheap ones that were compatible at tar-zhay. They were insanely loud and felt cheap. So it's nice to come back to these ""real"" replacements. Much quieter and they feel like they're doing more (although that last part could be psychosomatic?)"
4,We love our toothbrush.,"We have used this toothbrush for over 3 years now and the replacement heads are expensive in the stores, so I am glad they offer them here. Also they come on a scheduled delivery which is excellent. I must say though in the last batch that I received in February, one of the heads broke after just 6 weeks of use. I called and they are sending a replacement one. Excellent customer service."
4,Best toothbrush,"... and replacements. Recommended by my dentist, and I've seen noticeable results. The replacement heads are a bit pricy, but last a long time and I'd buy them again."
3,"Good product, would be better with identification",Philips should provide an easy way to identify these brush heads. My wife and I are sharing the same brush. There is no way of telling the heads apart. I ended-up marking them with a permanent marker ... but it is clearly not the most elegant system.
5,Replacements,"My husband loves this toothbrush, these replacement heads are a must have. This is a great price for the heads."
3,Sonicare e-Series Replacement Heads,"These are the real ones and they work. They are WAY better than the Equate knock-offs from Walmart. But on to why I give them only 3 stars. Water/toothpaste/drool get's down around the shaft and runs into the head causing mold to grow inside them. I even take them off and leave them to air dry when not being used and still get the mold. I put some silicone sealer around the little colored bands to see if it helps. So far, so good. Just make sure you don't seal the lower gap, because they need to be able to spin there for you to screw the heads on and off.UPDATE:The silicone trick works great. No more water getting down inside an causing a moldy mess. The silicone will not stick well and will easily turn on the neck, but it still keeps the water out. I'm happy I found a quick and easy fix."
4,Good Service,I received good service on my order of the Sonicare brush heads. The price was higher than I would have liked but I did not have to buy 6 brushes like the Costco value pack. It was still cheaper than drug stores and Walmart.
5,Works as Designed,These replacement heads for my Sonicare toothbrush work as designed and arrived promptly. The are less expensive than those I find locally.
3,seems softer than previous brushes,"I have used the new brush head for about three weeks now, and it seems to be wearing out much faster than my previous ones. I don't know if it's made differently or what. It's a bit disappointing because it takes longer and is more difficult than it used to be to remove plaque with it. I will continue using it and the product in the hope that this is just an anomaly."
1,Not too happy,"I have only had this product a month and it stops after 30 seconds. I restarted and it runs about 10 secs and stops. After a couple times of that, it won't run at all. Very frustrating."
2,tooth brushes,"I think Phillips has stopped making the original brush head. I don't like the feel of these replacements, but I'll use them until I can afford a new toothbrush."
3,"little brush, littler brush cover","This replacement head is not the original size. It is quite a bit smaller. That can be good for getting to the back teeth. No issue on that factor. But the plastic cover is very tight, and since I live with cats, I want my toothbrush head protected. The stem of the brush has some pivot capacity, which I never noticed on previous models. So when I push on the cap, I worry about what I am doing to the pivot part.What ever"
3,"Works, but a quite expensive.","It works as advertised. But they gotta lower the price...way to expensive. After one more round, I think i'm going to switch to manual brushes."
4,Good next generation performer,I had an original Sonicare for 7 years. Recently replaced it. The reason I bought an elite model was because it has the compact head option. I do love the compact head design. It's small enough to reach all the way back behind the last wisdom tooth. I used to use a dental pick to make sure I got all the plaque off. Now the small head brushes well enough that I no longer use the pick.
5,A Great Product,"My wife and I have been using the Sonicare tooth brushes for several years. We replace the brush heads about every 3-4 months. We have been very pleased with the performance of the units.The Sonicare units are easy to clean, and it is very easy to replace the brush heads. After using the Sonicare units, you place them in their chargers where they stay until you're ready to use them again. We've had no problems with the batteries in the units running low.Our only complaint is about the packaging of the replacement brush heads. The package is plastic, and it's sealed around the edges. It's very hard to open. I have to use metal cutters to cut through the sealed plastic. You would think Philips could come up with packaging that's just as secure, but is much easier to open."
3,Sonicare Mini Brush Heads. Quality Issue!,"Normally, I have been very satisfied with Amazon purchases. These mini Sonicare brush heads are not up to par!One was replaced by Philips because the magnet came off after a few uses. Now the second one I'm using has bristles coming out of the tooth brush head. I'm trimming them, but, quality is not what I expected!Norm of Westfield"
2,Doesn't last...,"I love the toothbrush, but these heads just don't last nearly as long as advertised. I feel like after a week they are soft and feel the same as the do after 3 months."
4,great,My only question is why aren't these in the local stores so we don't have to order over the internet? I really like my toothbrush but the head has to be changed after so much use. It is hard to tell exactly what you are getting over the internet and it is good to be able to see what you are getting.
5,Doug Matheson,I have used these brushes for years and find them well suited for clean teeth. The wear out about every 6-8 months and must be replaced.
5,Agree with others.,"Not much I can say that hasn't already been said. The E-series brushes are the best out there. The only down side is that I seem to go through these things way faster (they say change them once every three moths, I seem to wear mine out in a few weeks... with ""normal pressure"" and on the higher setting). But I love them!"
4,Great Brush heads,I just love this product. It definitely has improved my brushing experience . The Brush heads last for at least 3 months. My dentist commented that there is much improvement once I started using the product. The shipment was fast too.
5,Love My Sonicare,"My Sonicare was stolen from my luggage on an airline flight and I've ordered another. No matter how many times I brush with a manual toothbrush, my mouth doesn't feel nearly as clean as it does with a Sonicare. It is over-priced IMO, but some things are worth splurging on."
5,Take care of the teeth,"I have been using [[ASIN:B00008BQVM Philips Sonicare Advance (A-Series) Replacement Brush Head, Standard (2-Pack)]for two years now and I have had great dental checkups. My dentist recomends these tooth brushes and my teeth get cleaner. I would recomend these tooth brushes and they are less costly online at Amazon.com. My husband has been using them for many years now and he has had zero cavities. Try them I think you will like them."
4,oh happy day! smile......,love my brush heads! the price was truly better on line than in the store.the only negative comment would be that they seem to wear faster thanthe original head.
3,Average,"Nothing much to write home about. They are good. The Amazon priceis right. But, one should not buy these with the impression that theywill last a long time. After six months, the effectiveness decreases.Buy a few as replacment will be needed with frequent use."
5,Very good replacement heads for Philips electric toothbrush,"I bought these extra replacement heads for my Philipselectric toothbrushes, and am very pleased with themThey work very well -- just as well as the heads suppliedwith the original toothbrushes. They fit perfectly onto theoriginal toothbrush. They do an excellent job of keepingmy teeth clean.The seller was very good -- great packaging and fastservice. No complaints from me at all!High recommendation for this product and for the seller!"
4,Work good,We bought some off brand replacement heads that made a horrible chatter when the brush was turned on. Had to go back to the sonicare heads. Wish they were a little less pricey.
5,Replacement brush at a reasonable price,I always keep coming back to Amazon for more. I have used soniccare for a couple of years and have been very satisfied. The replacement brushes are pretty expensive and these 2 pack is reasonably prices. It was shipped and delivered on time.
5,Seems to work well and easy to use,We had a Walgreen's store brand before this. (Vibrating tooth brush.) Brushes no longer available. This is a whole lot better in cleaning and is much stronger. And very easy to change brush heads - (share w. wife).We both follow up using a waterpik.Only problem is it just comes w. one brush head. Had to order 2 extras - you just can't order 1.THIS WAS MEANT TO BE A REVIEW OF THE TOOTH BRUSH ITSELF - NOT THE BRUSH HEADS. I FILED IT UNDER THE WRONG ITEM AND CAN'T DELETE IT.
5,Sonicare Brush Heads,"Exactly what I was looking for. Had the angled heads- which is what I wanted. Got the item fast, with no complications. Easy checkout. Have and will use Amazon whenever I need anything!"
5,Works great with braces.,"I would highly recommend this product if you have braces. The brush head is very small so it gets in between all the hard to reach places. I recently got braces (at 27) and an electric toothbrush is the best choice. Some orthodontists will tell you that you can just use your manual toothbrush but I would disagree. When you have braces you spend so much time flossing, using a waterpik, and your proxy brush that an electric toothbrush just makes the process easier. Also, it cleans your teeth better. The hygienist knew I was using an electric toothbrush because my teeth were very clean."
2,just ok,i've used other electric brushes and this one pales in comparison. the heads wear out quickly.
1,yuck,Have you ever tried to clean the sonicare? All the crevices and places for water and germs to seep is too much. I'm a public health nurse and I think it's a haven for germs. I tried to clean it and the brush was still good but I couldn't remove the mildewy smell despite 20 minutes of scrubbing it with (yes) an old regular toothbrush to get into the crevices.I'll look for another but won't be surprized if I cannot find an electric one that doesn't have similar problems.One more thing- this electric brush also isn't the best for people with disabilities who rely on others for cleaning their toothbrushes.I've wondered if there will be a tooth brush disease to be discovered like legionnaires someday.Hello tooth brush companies- if you tout how easy it is to clean your electric toothbrush people will sit up and listen.Julie- Public Health Nurse from Minnesota
1,Too expensive,"Like printer ink these little bits of plastic and magnets are total rip-offs. Look that them. $12 each? Give me a break. And then they ""recommend"" throwing it away after three months. I used my last one for two years. When the handle goes, I will NOT be buying another one of these."
4,Very pleased,"I was so happy to find these replacement heads for my OLD Sonic Toothbrush. Since it is so old, I was afraid I could not find replacement heads to fit. But, lo and behold, these actually fit quite well and saved me from buying a new toothbrush. Thanks!"
5,Philips Sonicare Elite REPLACEMENT BRUSH HEADS,Cleans the teeth pretty thoroughly. Just make sure you clean the metal insides every few days and you are fine. Overall a solid product.
5,perfect replacement,Hard to find compact heads in stores in my area - online purchase was easy. Fast delivery.
4,"Good, but not as good as the originals","It works pretty good, only one thing that I am not very satisfied is:the rubber rings and covers on the heads are not as tight as the original ones came with the toothbrush I bought before. The water and toothpaste mix will sink through the gaps and need extra care after each time using."
4,GREAT PRODUCT I WILL NEVER GO BACK,I NEVER USED SONICAR PRODUCTS BEFORE THIS ONE I WILL NEVER GO BACK TO BRUSHING WITH A REG TOOTHBRUSH!
1,"E Series brush head is of poor quality, and leaks.","The ""E"" series brush head leaks into the base, and can also vibrate loose. I found the old ""A"" series on line, and purchased them. They don't leak, nor come loose!I contacted Philips direct, and told them of this problem, and they said that they knew about it, but was not doing anything to correct it."
1,"Poor quality control, black mold","This is the first time Amazon Subscribe & Save has sent me this kind of brush head. Previously Amazon sent Sonicare Advance heads, and I never had any problems with those. The newer brush heads fit the handle but are of much lower quality. One of the metal posts in the bottom of the brush head broke after a month of use. Black mold began growing after a few months and is difficult to get rid of.I want the old brush heads back."
4,"Good, But Expensive","Excellent replacements to many Sonicare products. I was afraid they wouldn't fit my model, but they looked like they would and they did. I used to change my head every month, but since these are more expensive I've been only exchanging them once every two months or so. They still seem great after 2 month's use!Definitely recommend getting these, and if you feel like it's about time for a replacement then I wouldn't hesitate to pick up a set. The only downside to this product is the price - I feel like they could be charging a lot less for it."
5,Good toothbrush,"Always use the toothbrush and I have to buy a replacement from time to time, this seller has been faster in sending spare parts and as described on page .."
5,Sonicare Toothbrush Heads,I have used this product for years. The brushes works so well that I continue to have excellent dental checkups from switching from a normal toothbrush. I use no other. Thanks Amazon for including this product in your inventory to purchase.
5,Fits my e-series perfectly,"Fits my eSeries Sonicare and works well. I purchased the ""no hassle packaging"" option and saved a dollar or two."
5,Don't go cheap on the brush heads!,"My wife and I have used Sonicare for years and I'm a firm believer that it has improved the health of our teeth and gums. Recently we tried Target's Up & Up generic heads and they were AWFUL! They didn't form a tight seal with the plastic threading and just vibrated making a ton of noise and ineffective brushing. Amazon has a great price, especially if you do Subscribe & Save so don't go cheap on this one."
5,The item was new in the box,The item was new in the box and shipped very fast. They are good to fit my Philips Sonicare Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush.
2,boyleka,"Beware of the word 'compact'! This may mean that the teeny tiny brush will fit even your newborn's mouth. Would have been perfect if not for the size. Also, while purusing Costco, the larger brush version of these brushes were there in a 6 pack for $49.99. Just a thought!"
3,"Good, not great","Pro: These toothbrush heads are a good size and they allow me to easily get to the back molars. Con: They seem to wear out fairly quickly, which could get expensive. For example- I have only had the toothbrush 2 months and have already gone through one of the replacement heads."
1,Disappointed.,"I liked Sonicare E toothbrush so much and that is why I ordered this replacement head. Well,,, the bristle is not as soft as the original one. It is so rough and stiff. I know that most of the bristles, in the beginning it is not soft. However, I think it shoule have the softness at the beginning considering the expensive price!!! I think the bristle in the beginning is just same as dollar piece ones. I am disappointed. I will change to oral B electric toothbrush once this one is worn."
3,$22.74 = 10 regular toothbrushes,The expense really adds up but electric toothbrushes are addictive.
4,Buy a toothbrush and save nothing. Buy this and save millions of dollars every month for hundreds of thousands of years.,Buy a toothbrush and save nothing. Buy this and save millions of dollars every month for hundreds of thousands of years.
5,Replacement Brush Heads,"While the heads are very small, they are what I expected and arrived in a timely manner."
5,Sonicare Elite,This is a great price for these replacement brush heads. I have shopped locally and online. This price coupled with no shipping charge and no tax cannot be beat.
3,Cost Savings?,"We've owned this system for a number of years now. While the brush heads seem to work fine, we just replaced them, the body of the brush which is subject to rotation so that the head and the battery commpartment are not always lined up making it slightly more difficult to opperate the brush."
1,"Overpriced, and don't last","I'm a bit upset that I go through these brushes so fast, but they do a good job with cleaning. The box says they should last for several weeks, however I've found that any longer then a month or a month and a half and I'm very disappointed with performance as well as feel."
2,Improvement Needed,I have a small mouth and end up using the smaller brush heads. The company needs to improve the quality on this item. They do not last very long at all. I have had to replace 2 heads in UNDER 6 months!
1,Repackaged toothbrushes,"I received my supposedly ""new"" sonicare replacement toothbrushes that were not in the original packaging and had been put in new packaging. Given that this is an item that goes in your mouth I think it is unreasonable and unsanitary that this item be re-sold without its original packaging. I never would have ordered this item if I known that you repackaged a dental tooth brush.I now know why you picture the two replacement toothbrushes without being in their original package"
1,Deceptive,I was disappointed in the size of the replacement head. It was not clearly stated in add that it was a smaller version of the original toothbrush head.
3,Not so long to stay with me !!!,"The brush is nice for me to enough small to clean my tooth up !!!However the brush could not be stayed with me longer than expected, or advertised.The replacement schedule for each may be 1 month and half.The two brushes need to replace within 3 moths or less."
5,Been using for years,Our dentist credits my consistently good check-ups to the Sonicare. We have had our original charger for years and order replacement brushes every three months as recommended. A little pricey up front but well worth the investment.
4,I like this toothbrush,"I'm very pleased that I now use the Sonicare toothbrush. It does help me keep my smile clean. I have dry mouth due to the medications I take, so using the Sonicare toothbrush makes me feel like I'm doing my teeth a favor than just a regular toothbrush. It came highly recommended by my dental hygeinist."
5,Product was just what I wanted but I wasn't sure,Sonicare has so many models over the years and several different brush heads that I could only use the brush photos as a check to see if these were the correct ones and fortunately they were. There's no imprint on my unit that says what model it is. More clarity about the brush choices and applicable models would be very helpful.
1,Defective brush head,"One of the brush heads stopped working in a week. I have just started using the second brush head and don't know how long it will last. I have been using Sonicare for a few years and have bought brush heads from other retailers and this has never happened. I am not sure if the one I received is defective or was damaged by Amazon while preparing their ""Frustration free packaging"""
4,"These Fit Older Soniccare ""Advance"" bodies also","Leave it to someone else to sell you on the value of a Sonicare. Yes, it's pricey, but it may be worth it. What WASN'T worth it to me was the thought that my perfectly servicable ""Advance"" had become obsolete, and replacement heads for it were scarce as hen's teeth. It may have been worth it to buy an expensive toothbrush once--but I wasn't about to do it twice. I was greatly relieved to find that these brush heads fit the Advance just fine. They are smaller, and some people like them that way. I really don't care, though, if pressed, I would call them an improvement in getting around the corners of my mouth. They certainly work fine. And they are cheaper than a whole new setup."
5,Sonicare Elite Brush heads work for the Advance Sonicare series,"The Elite Sonicare Brush heads work fine with the Advance Sonicare Electric Toothbrush that I have. The Elite are thinner, smaller; but work fine with my Advance Sonicare. I find I can get back behind the molars more easily with the Elite Brush heads than with the more expensive Advance Brush heads. I would have bought them earlier if I had known that they would fit my sonicare."
3,Philips Sonicare E-Series Replacement Brush,"Like other reviewers stated, the brush is good when new but Philips makes a special effort to make this product as short lived as possible.At first they changed the recommendation to replace it from every six month to every 3 month and then they changed the bristles to wear out even faster so after few weeks it feels worn out. For over $10 a brush I would expect it to last longer."
3,Sonicare Elite,The product is just exactly what I was looking for.I later found the heads at Wal-Mart.The price/unit is cheaper at Wal-Mart.
3,Sonicare Brush Heads,"These brush heads work well. However, I would prefer to see a larger size bristlehead like the one made for the Advance model."
5,Great toothbrush,"This toothbrush does a great job of keeping your teeth and gums in great shape. It turns itself off after two minutes (usually the recommending brushing time) and it's easy to keep clean. We've worn out two previous Sonicare's and this is the only brand I'll use. The simpler the machine, the easier it is to keep in good condition and this basic brush will take care of anyone. One last thing that really good: the battery lasts for over a week before the brush needs to be recharged."
5,Best deal,These 3 brush heads are an awsome deal. I did the subscribe and save option and paid around 8 bucks each. the same 3 pack at wally world was 50. This is the best toothbrush I have ever used. After our dentist recommended it we purchased it from Amazon as it was a better price. Can't say we have been sorry. It would have been worth double the price.
5,Philips Sonicare E-Series Replacement Brush Head,"The Philips Sonicare E-Series Replacement Brush Head is exactly the same as the original one, when I purchased my Sonicare tooth brush kit. The off-brand series was noisy and a noticeable reduction actuation power. Stick with Philips Sonicare E-Series Replacement Brush Head - you will be 100% satisfied."
3,Was better before,These were great before they became backward compatible with the earlier model bodies. I have an E-series (actually two of them so I fully discharge one while the other sits in the charger). These brushes need to be very tightly torqued onto the body or else the handle vibrates instead of the brush head. After the plastic threads have stretched a bit you do not have to twist as hard. Always remove and rinse the brush assembly after each use or disgusting stuff will grow inside.
5,Excellent,I was happy to find replacement brushes at a good price. They arrived promptly and in excellent condition. Thank you!
1,power toothbrush,"I find these replacement heads are poorly made, I am not sure why. I thought at first it was one that was defective but with every replacement head the brissles come out which is one very annoying and uncomfortable when brushing my teeth. I will cancel any future orders."
5,Great option,"Works great as replacement heads. Also, if you're looking at doing the generics I would recommend against them as these are far less noisy."
4,Sonicare replacement head,I like the ease of replacing the heads. Large threads make it easy to change and remove for cleaning. Thumbs up.
3,Dont last very long,"These brushes (frustration free) don't seem to last as long as the ones that i buy in the store, but the price makes up for it. I on my 2nd 2-pack in 4 months - they usually last 3 months or more..."
1,philips repacement brushes,brushes were not of same quality. do not fit properlywould not buy again.prior purchases were ok. looks like they changed purveyors
1,Wish I hadn't bought it,"It came minus one of the rubber feet that makes it non-skid. It is very heavy and hard to move around. I have banished it to the garage after a few uses, and replaced it with a Cosco aluminum ladder of the same size and type. There are better ladders than this, and I am sorry I bought it."
5,excellent ladder,"This ladder is sturdy, but light enough to carry easily. Wooden ladders get shakey and are heavy. This ladder is the perfect replacement, especially if you are not as strong as you once were. The tray is an added bonus!"
2,Tricam Skinny MiniStep Stool,I have a Skinny Mini since about 1995 but much lighter which I can pick up very easily and fold easier. The new one now is about 2o# and almost takes a man to pick up. What happened to the light weight step stoop? Its identical without the paint tray and in a nice green instead of this awful color. I didn't need a commercial grade for our church to use for higher cabinets for seasonal stored light weight objects. They could offer two types.
2,Clinique perfume,I love the perfume. The top does not stay on the bottle. Which is very irritating.I will probably order another bottle and see if was just defective.
3,Bad Remote,This is a great DVD and CD player just FYI the remote is terrible you need to replace the remote itself before it needs new batteries!
1,Poorly Designed DVD Player,"I purchased this unit thinking I'd be able to replace both my CD player and my DVD player - no such luck. Instead of a 7-disk carousel, this unit is comprised of 7 individully moving blades that hold each disk. The unit is very noisy, changing disks is much slower compared to carousel units and the blades are prone to jam. In less than a month of sporatic use, I lost digital output and 4 disks became trapped inside. If you can, avoid this DVD player."
2,"Great features, but too noisy","I am returning this player 20 minutes after opening it. I agree with all reviews that this player is too noisy and slow. The ""fins"" click too much from simply moving from 1 disk to another. The depth of this thing makes it a monster. Remember that it's 19"" in depth. It overwhelmed my new cabinet which is large to begin with."
2,Don't Be A Victim,"I must admit that I had high expectations for this album. After hearing the song and seeing the video for ""It's All Real"", they really had me believing that they were really going to bring it back to the essence with this album. I mean the song and video were street and it reminded me of a time when hip-hop wasn't all about bling bling, girls, money, cars, etc. But after buying it yesterday for only $6.99, I have to admit they got me. Other than the two premo joints and one other song, I couldn't believe what a waste of my money this was. I mean they did songs songs with Swizz Beats, Busta Rhymes(who by the way hasn't been hip-hop since 1998), Foxy Brown, and Teddy Riley. Nowadays, too many artists try to appeal to too many audiences in one album. Either do hip-hop all out or do the mainstream rap thing all out."
3,"Hot Lyrics, Weak Beats!","When I first heard ""IT'S All Real"". I had to find out who were these cats rhyming over this DJ Premiere beat. When I found out it was Pitch Black, I had high expectations for this album. Now this album is finally here I'm mad disappointed. These are some hardcore street cats, why is Teddy Riley producing on this album. The beats he produced on are (Geechy, My Life) those tracks really hurt the album. It's like the Lox rhyming over Quincy Jones Beats! These cats lyrics are forreal. But no beats to back em up. Swizz Beats produced 2 tracks (Shake That, N.Y.C.) Those tracks are O.K. Over all it's a O.K. album. They got appearances by Buster Rhymes and Foxy Brown but they didn't help the album any. Once they get better production these cats will be a group to look out for. My overall opinion of this album is 3 stars. I wouldn't tell my boys to run out and get this album."
4,"Pitch Black,,,,,Somewhat dissapointing...","After hearing ""It's All Real"", I knew I had to get this CD. So after 2 months of waiting for this album, I copped it at Best Buy for 6.99, and it was well worth my money. This record dissapoints becasue it doesnt have the same style as ""Its All Real"". I thought this would be some ill underground record, but it was leaning towards the mainstream, with only a little underground edge. Dissapointing, but good. I love some mainstream sound so it's not horrible, just a different style then I expected. Has a few good tracks, but Premo should of produced more then just 2 cuts. ""geechy"" is the worst track, while ""Its all real"" is one of the illest tracks of 2003/2004."
5,"Great Cd, dont kno wut the people are listenin to","The CD is amazing ""its all real"" is good w/ dj pre. Its a hardcore album, the lyrics and music go well together and with the album, u should def buy if u into real hip-hop and not all commerical advertised or over played. other good songs include ""to be the best"" << nice hook and ""reckognize"" etc, def a good album, whoever said they didnt like it, dont know what their talkin or just simply dont appreciate good hip-hop music & talent..."
2,ehhh,"for 6.99 i might as well keep it.. its all real is the best track, got it locked w/ fox... busta rhymes track starts nice and is just so boring.. the whole album sucked kind of... but the 1st song was nice."
5,my review for 'Pitch Black Law',"i was watching 'Rap City Tha Bassment' in my room one day and i saw the video for Pitch Black's 'It's All Real.' right then it wuz my favorite rap. after hearing that i wuz thinkin about how their album would be, i thought it wuz gonna be great. great beats and hot lyrics. i waited 3 months. i bought it the next day it came out, then i started to listen to it. i wuz lovin it. i wuz likin the beats a lot and i wuz lovin the rhymes and the lyrics. all the tracks were good to me, including the ol' skool track 'It's All Real.' but that's not the only hot rhyme. 'Got It Locked' iz hot too. i think Pitch Black iz the group of the future. 'Pitch Black Law'...it's all real."
3,3.5,"Good lyrics, wack beats through whole lp. Swizz sounds tired, Primo blessed some joints, Teddy Riley is just wack, No names on beats, etc. Its too spotty, and not at all what I expected (after hearing ITS ALL REAL). I would recommend listening to it first (download it or get it from a friend) b4 copping it. DO NOT GO OUT ON A LIMB AND COP IT B4 HEARING IT, U COULD BE SERIOUSLY DISAPPOINTED..."
1,a waste of money,"man i bought this on the recommendations of a few freinds that heard ""its all real."" this collection of songs is horrible, and not worth the plastic it is recorded on. its not the production thats bad (though many times it is not great), its the horrible emceeing.. these guys don;t talk about anything, and use every 2 cent buzz word in hip hop idiom over and over again.. i cant beleive their website has the nerve to call these guys the next best thing, as if they were the next rakin or something... i doubt we will ever hear of these guys again"
2,asdf,"one great song, another good one, a few enjoyable 'meh's and the rest is filler garbage... not overly bad lyrics, but forgettable, cheap and imitation commercial instrumentals... i'm glad it was so cheap...peace,"
2,i hate jumping on bandwagons!,"but there right. Besides ""It's All Real"", produced by DJ Premier, who definatley seems to bring out the best in these formerly ""underground"" emcees, the rest of the cd is full of mediocre production and tired lyrics.Besides the aforementioned it's all real, I couldn't get ALL the way through a single song.peace,(just download it's all real, and put it on your homemade ""dope songs produced by Premier"" mixtape)"
2,2.5 Stars,"I thought that Pitch Black was going to be the beginning of the end for party rap, but I was wrong. DJ Premier has his great signature production on this album, but Pitch Black is nothing to get excited about. NOT RECOMMENDED."
2,In the dark!!!,"I heard this album about a week ago,my friend lent it to me and I listened to it it was a very weak production of what we call nu-rap.The song with Busta was off the hook and I liked one other song that was about it.I have listened to rap all my life,I'm 27 now and take it from me do not buy this,it sounds like a rush job.They tried to throw together some beats and put it out.They can rap no doubt but it sounds thrown together.HATED IT!!!"
2,Over hyped and a tease,Someone told me about Pitch Black before the album was released and say they were dope so I picked it up.. True Pitch Black the group can flow and have well written lyrics but the beats are a total bore and a joke. I'm not a big DJ Premier fan I think his beats are boring and the cd overall was a big bore and waste of money. MOTHER F*CK I could've got a better album!
4,Silver connectors too. This is the only way to hook up a Winch,"These are great ones. You do need to solder them in. Hey this is the only way to go ya know.I did find some draw backs so I had to knock off a star. The connectors are too small to solder into. The solder on connectors are only for about a size 10ga wire. I use double00 welding cables to run my battery to my winch. Hey I draw some big amps when I do things. As much as 200 amps down a double00 cable is about right for pulling 13,000 lbs. or a tad bit more. I know I have to use my oxy torch to melt the solder on the cables There is a lot more room for them to make the end parts bigger.dray"
2,dont buy,"I usually like products from these guys but this knife sharpener did nothing for any knife that I used it on. After sitting there and going over and over with the action to sharpen the knives, nothing was coming to fruition. Now, perhaps under a microscope I could have seen improvement in the blade but not with my naked eyes or in using it."
1,buy a better product,complete waste of money. spend it on a better product. this couldn't sharpen anything no matter how hard you tried.
1,Dont buy,"I was in need of a quick in the field/on the hike sharpener. I looked to Gerber to fill my needs, seeing that I have many of their other products and have been 100% satisfied with them. The first time I used it, all of the sharpening rods became loose inside the plastic enclosure and would spin when I pulled a knife through it. This made the sharpener useless. I figured it may have a been a defective unit, so I returned it for another one. This new unit had the same problem, I was able to sharpen one small Gerber pocket knife before this unit broke. Note: This all happened about a 18 months ago, so the issue MAY have been addressed."
2,Works - kinda. Better products out there.,"I purchased the sharpener from a local retailer. The sharpener's base is too thin to be stable when sharpening and the plastic slides around. If the sharpener was a little thicker and had rubber on the base (more like the yellow Smith's pocket sharpener) it would be much more functional. I like the idea of not having the carbide blades, as the diamond rods are better for your knife's steel, but wish I had gone with the Accusharp SharpNEasy thru Amazon because it offers everything that the Gerber product does plus a wider base with rubber on it.Sharp-n-Easy 2 Step Knife SharpenervsGerber Blades 22-41307 Diamond Pocket Sharpener"
3,I still can't get a knife razor sharp.,"The fact I can't get a knife as sharp as my Dad could is probably more a reflection on me than it is the product. It's convenient and it gets my knives sharper. Mission accomplished.Buy something else to go with this product though as the shipping costs are almost as much as the item, effectively doubling the price."
2,does it sharpen?,"yeah.....it sharpens beautifully...only if u had a grip on the little thing. it's an inch wide, and 1.5 inches long. u put yer fingers in the groove, and hold the knife in the other hand. problem is.....is that this lil piece of junk wont stay steady, so it gives yer knife a swerve of sharpness here and there. and it doesnt even think to sharpen your blade tip for an inch down. buy it if u want, and u'll c wot i mean. go ahead....it's only 3 bucks. 3 bucks wasted that is."
3,eh?,"Well this is a cheap sharpener, so i guess i must have been expecting the mona lisa, but it came on time and it did sharpen somewhat. And the sharpeners on the thing don't look like the picture, they are white rods. I couldn't tell if the sharpeners were wrapped in a white casing or not but i tried sharpening and it did what it was supposed to. I say again, i guess i was expecting a mona lisa. but if you wanna sharpen katanas or something this one isn't exactly the best choice, maybe the cheapest, but not the best choice....it's a KNIFE & BOWIE SHARPENER not katana."
5,The Most Comprehensive and Most In Depth Study Bible So Far,"I am so thrilled whenever I read the Nelson NKJV Study Bible. It's was so organized, and full of Divine revelation on every annotation for each of the verse. The Word focus feature also gives me an in-depth understanding of the meaning in its original Greek and Hebrew word. Each summary chart and in depth study article is a devotional and theological illumination to understand more the very context of the written Word and its application in our lives. I have been collecting all kinds study bible and so far this is the best and most complete."
4,Great Commentary,"Good translation, and the commentary is first rate. In addition to the bottom-page comments on specific verses, there are longer comments on specific topics and words. One caveat though, where some study Bibles will give several possible interpretations for a specific verse, this one will often (not always) just say ""it seems best to interpret this as such-and-such"". Still, there is a lot of useful information here, I'm definitely glad I got this."
5,Awesome Book,This is the best pound for pound study bible known to man. This is just an Awesome Book!
5,Great Study Bible,"This is a great Bible. I have many study bibles, but only a few in the NKJV & this is the best I've seen for this translation. I find that the NKJV is more accurate than the KJV (not to bash the KJV, for I still like it & use it), but I have to be honest. I like the layout of this Bible. It's not cluttered & leaves room for me to record my own notes because I don't always agree with the notes in this Bible. If you're looking for a nice study bible in the NKJV, I don't think you'll find anything else so in-depth like this one. I believe Nelson has done a great job. I have the blue bonded leather & it's very well made (odd). This will be my main bible for a while."
2,Tezuka School of Animation,I have seen better animation books I would not recoment this book for a animation class.
3,Nintendo DS Slim Magnifier and Slide Grip Kit,This magnifier enlarges onscreen applications very well. There's only one drawback--it doesn't snugly fit my Nintendo DS Lite. I have to just lay the Nintendo on top of the kit and hold the kit to ensure it doesn't slip off.
1,Have to sit through several minutes of previews ... twice!,"The content of these DVDs is great. My son loves Fireman Sam. That being said, HIT/Lionsgate has created these DVDs so that you have to sit through several minutes of previews to get to the autoplay feature. Then, when you select autoplay, you have to sit through the previews again before you can watch the program. Anyone with an impatient two-year-old can imagine what a pain this is. Shame on HIT/Lionsgate for forcing this on consumers."
1,Same episodes On Demand,"Disappointed it is the same old episodes on Cable On Demand, just repackaged onto DVD with new date May 2009. There should be more information stating that- save the money and watch it on Cable."
1,poor quality,"When I replaced the ink cartridge in the printer, the newly purchasedEpson T017-18 Black/Color Ink Cartridge Dual Pack did not work. It would not release the ink. I had to throw away and purchase a new one else where. I should have asked for a replacement."
4,Excellent historical account of the first Holland MI settlers,"Really enjoyed the book because I have lived in Holland my entire life and my Grandparents moved here about 1900 or sixty years after VanRaalte brought the first dutch settlers over. Hard to believe they came to the area knowing so little about what they were getting into as far as weather and terrain and really just the ability to survive. Hard to believe they continued with their beliefs and followed VanRaalte after such a horribly hard first winter when over half the people perished. The book really provides insight into the early settlers strength and ability to survive. The book is a good mix of fiction, storytelling, and history."
3,Poser's need not apply,"This is for the poser from the Netherlands, if it wasn't for Motoerhead you'd be listing to Julie Andrews.. Yodel !!, Grow up these guys have paved the road ( hell!!, built the road!!) for groups to come and if you can't hear it in this album, then pick up the next one and hear how its done, because THERE NOT GOING ANYWHERE BUT TO THE TOP!!. Thats the thing about Motoerhead youmay not like whats on this album, but like the weather just wait! it'll change for the better and Motoeread Does( BY there rules)and noboby and I mean NOBODY ROCKS like this band."
5,Everything By Motorhead Is good,Motorhead is one of my favorite bands. I feel that they have received a bum rap here in the US due to albums not always availble as well as poor publicity. I will say that not every song by them is top notch. But that is the case with every band. 90% of motorhead material is GREAT. It is sad that not everyone has had the motorhead experience.
1,Never felt so bad,"Although I love dirty love in real life, this record by a bunch of old geezers called Motorhead, only serves to remind me of past glories. Theirs of course, I myself am still very much 'on the job', as me and my fellows from the Rotarly like to call it. 'Rock My Bollocks' and 'Taste Me, You Lying Bimbo' are bad titles to bad bad songs. It's time somebody stepped in and said to these sorry guys: ""Please: there's a band called BZN and they do it better; lock up and go home."" I would like to be that somebody, so there you go."
4,"Great movie, but . . .","Honestly, watching Silence of the Lambs nowadays, it's just so freaking obvious how much the X-Files took from it. Of course, much has been said about Foster's Starling being the inspiration for the X-Files's Dana Scully. However, the influence of this movie -- the cinemtography, mood, dialogue, pacing, costumes, and villians -- is just so clear on the X-Files, especially its first season.Unfortunatedly, having watched the X-Files for years, it has dulled the impact of Silence of the Lambs. Its style has been so copied and done that Silence of the Lambs merely now seems like among the best of its type, rather than a groundbreaking thriller.Still, I'd highly recommend its viewing, if nothing else but to see where the X-Files took its basic skeleton from."
4,Gotta Love the Extra Content,"This movie is one of my favorites, and the extra content on this disc more than justify the extra cost. The deleted scenes are interesting, as are the quotes from killers and FBI notes. But it's the commentary track that is the real gem. I always love commentary tracks, and this one doesn't disapoint. The only thing that keeps it from getting 5 stars is the Audio track. While the quality is excellent, it isn't in AC-3."
5,This CD is awesome!!!!,My band teacher is in this CD and he is really good. It has a good beat and sounds really good!!!
2,Not good at all...,"This is bad trumpet playing! This is not proffesinals, I hope. Vaste of money. Nice songs thoug!!"
4,Many Shadows,"This book is a fun, short, absorbing read. There are many shadows associated with Heaven and this short book takes the time to explore them all satisfactorily. Each page is crammed with action and suspense. Highly recommmended."
5,Wow! Great unusual scent,"I learned about these from Oprah's website & her decorator who said he uses them. I wanted to try the candle (too much $$) so these travel tin's seemed the safest way (in case I didn't like them). I will be ordering some more. I've been sharing but think now I will get a little greedy and keep them all to myself! The quince scent is an unusual one - you almost think you won't like it. Then you get a whiff of it walking by and think, ""No, I really like this!"" Try it, I think you'll enjoy the fresh and exotic scent."
5,Excellent,If you are going to buy one fox terrier book make it this one.Simple and concise with pertinent information.
1,You have to see a fox terrier to believe how amazing they are!,Save your money and do a Google search on fox terriers or actually visit a breeder and see many different fox terriers to get a true sense of their personality. There is no way a book can adequately capture the essence of these unique and spunky dogs.
2,Nice pics but was looking for more in depth info,"This book is ""okay"" but I hoped that it went into more details about the personality and communications with the Fox terrier.Most of the info in this book is covered in other Pet Manuals that I would recommend more than this book."
5,Wow! What an eye-opener!,"Really hot! My view of Brothels and legal prostitution has been changed forever! A fast page-turner, easy reading and I laughed til I cried. Stories about the lives of the ""hookers"" had me fasinated, tickled and sad all at the same time. Stories about the men who frequent brothels were just as intriguing. This book is a gem. Answered every question imanginable about sex for sale, and then some. What a find!"
3,Not good to study for General Chemistry Praxis test,"I was going to use this to study for the General Teacher Praxis tests, but it does not cover the depth needed. The book might be good for someone who has recently taken a chemistry class, to fill in some blanks. But is not a good overall general class prep.I did find ""Basic Physics : A Self-Teaching Guide (Wiley Self-Teaching Guides)"" to be just what I was looking for."
1,Disappointed,I was very dissapointed in this book. It did not go into great depth on any of the subjects I am studying in my Calculus based physics class in College. There were very few sample problems worked out. Basically all that was covered were definitions and equations. I would not recommend this to anyone.
2,Decent textbook,This book did not sufficiently prepare me for the PRAXIS II General Science test. It was broad and at times it did not go into as much detail as it should have.
2,Cliffsnotes Physics,I don't really recommend this book because I used for when I was physics a couple of years ago. It wasn't too helpful because many physics teachers teach physics very differently but maintain the same concepts. This book guides you differently. I found it to be no help to me at all. But I did purchase it for about eighty cents or so from the person.
2,Its okay...,"This book is okay if you want a very general overview of physics. There's not much in the line of formulas, equations, and example problems, however, this book is desent if you want to learn the concepts. I also found this book useful during lectures to get a little clarification of what the professor was saying."
2,Not for everyone,Bought this to use in my car because someone I know likes it a great deal. It didn't do anything for me.
3,chewy goat heads,"Well, I just finished the first time through on this book and I can't say it's as good as his first one in this series (or the 2nd one for that matter.) I mean, it's alwright and I'll read it again, but it's a little more flowery and rambling than the previous two. It seemed like he was relying more on data gathered from others in writing this one as opposed to the stong impression of personal experience I gandered from the others in this series. I'm a little dissapointed, but then I had very high expectations and a strong interest in the subjects he discusses. He just left out alot of things I would have considered important maybe, but overall a good book."
3,Not bad,"Not bad, but not the best! I have VHS of a rehearsal from a TV broadcast from many years ago that I like a lot better."
5,Manhattan Transfer -35th Anniversary,"This item arrived in a timely manner and in excellent condition. Another brilliant work by the Manhattan Transfer! Fans should own a copy, for sure!"
5,religious experience,"This CD virtually NEVER leavesmy player! If it's not at ome it's in my car. There's nothing better than driving down the highway with The Blasters playing as loud as possible. (except seeing them live, of course) That, my friends is truly a religous experience! No matter how tired, sweaty or drunk you are, you can't help rockin to these fabulous boys. It takes you somewhere else, somwhere you never want to leave!"
5,American music at its finest,"This is a tremendous re-issue! I recommend geting it on the 2 disc special edition vinyl through Miles of Music.Anyway, this album is a must for any Blasters or rock'n'roll fan who needs an adrenalin rush and a good look at the band before it expanded to it most potent configuration with Gene Taylor, Steve Berlin (currently in Los Lobos) and the late great Lee Allen for the series of great albums on Slash Records (which hopefully will get re-issued)."
4,Where's The Rest Of Their Music?,"The fact that this is the only Blasters CD available shows how lame the American Music scene can get. Their live EP from a tour of the UK is just about the greatest live rock ever recorded (right up there with Live At Leeds and Get Yer Ya-Yas Out). The first few Blasters LPs were masterful--and they had to fight to get those released. They were hotter than hot live, and classy studio stuff too.Hunt down ALL Blasters LPs. This I command you."
5,awesome,"An excellent, well-shot video of an epic race. Love the music and Bob Roll's narration. Too bad I watch again with a different perspective about Lance winning it."
5,excellent bike race,"Very well done movie, the people, and the race are all impressive. Good background information on some of the riders as well. The video isn't too long or too short. Makes you want to get out and go riding."
5,All bike riders should own this!,"Excellent!!! The scenery is amazing, the talent and emotion of the race is like nothing I have seen for mountain biking. Very inspirational and you will be motivated to ride after watching it. A must have for any hike enthusiast"
5,Christmas present purchase,Came quickly in the mail and was in perfect condition with no rips or bent corners. Very satisfied family member for christmas!
1,Hardly Authoratative,A very short program that does not allow for differing views and which does not answer all of the questions. The problem is the lack of research and analysis of other theories. If you want a more extensive analysis from an authority on the subject read Fatal Hour by G. Robert Blakey which was originally published as The Plot to Kill the President in hardback. He was the Chief Counsel and Staff Director on the House Select Committee on Assassinations which was convened in the late 70's to reexamine the assassination. You will love it.
1,A very weak attempt to justify the Warren report,"I stopped watching this DVD not even halfway. What a fake computer animation. I have been to Dealay Plaza myself and know that this ""so called"" animation can not be true. I have thrown the dvd in a corner and might watch it again. I don't understand that Peter Jennings wanted to present this. If you believe the Warren Commision then this is the DVD for you. If not don't bother."
1,Lies Lies Lies,Why oh why do people fall for this one sided hogwash of a documentary. This is nothing but lies from start to finish. Recomended and apparently liked by people who know nothing about the facts of the assassination.
1,Propaganda lies at its worst!,I strongly recommend for all to watch this program with an open mind. Then take a deep breadth and re-watch it again. It is only the second time watching it that you realize only an idiot would believe what a bunch of lies this program tries so hard to convy to its audience.JFK's assassination was a government-big business conspiracy that not only killed JFK but hundreds of thousands of our young soldiers in Vietnam and elsewhere. Truly sad and truly pathetic.Peter Jennings should be ashamed of himself for becoming an instrument of the big business to cover up their lies and murder for a lousy few dollars extra.
5,Getting to the bottom line.,This is another great item that shows the most likely (and only) person that shotthe President was L.H. Oswald.
1,This Fraud Should Bear The Caution: Pro-Government Propaganda,"ABC News anchor Peter Jennings endorses, as the absolute and definitive truth, the 1964 Warren Commission Report that concluded Lee Harvey Oswald alone assassinated President Kennedy - notwithstanding the Report is discredited and over 70% of Americans believe there was a conspiracy. Jennings' purported proof: a computer simulation by an amateur technician, Dale Myers, who created a 3D interpretation of Abraham Zapruder's famous 8mm home movie of the murder using Dealey Plaza's topography. When the notorious Allen Dulles ran the CIA in the 1950s, he created ""Operation Mockingbird"" to massively infiltrate and manipulate the U.S. news media. Jennings succeeds only in unmasking himself as a high-profile mockingbird."
1,The worst movie on JFK's assasination I've ever seen,"Here's 2 bucks and 1 hours of my time I'll never get back. Constructed as a piece of CIA propaganda, this pseudo-documentary starts from the assumption that Oswald was the killer. He's guilty from the start. Period. The rest is making the case for his guilt by the careful pick-and-choose of arguments made against Oswald, without giving any attention to the plethora of arguments that have been made ever since that fatal day in favor of Oswald's innocence. This is almost a hit-work for the official story. Save your time, skip this piece of junk."
1,...And you call us idiots!,"I watched less than 10 minutes of this tripe; it's obviously another effort(like Gerald Posner's arrogantly-titled 'Cased Closed')to convince us that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone. To you who want to put so much stock in a computer-animated 'recreation': LOOK AT THE ZAPRUDER FILM! That fatal head shot came from the front-right; there's no question in my mind, and no one will ever convince me otherwise. If you want to hear and see some really thought-provoking evidence in the Kennedy assassination, purchase the British-produced series ""The Men Who Killed Kennedy."" It's well-researched, and it contains interviews with people WHO WERE THERE on November 22, 1963 and the immediate days after, and who where EYE WITNESSES to the events.Sorry, Mr. Meyers.........""Single bullet 'fact'?"" Not buying it....will never buy it."
1,Garbage not worth the shelf space,"If you have to watch this rubbish, check it out online or at the library, don't waste your money. The computer animation (cartoon) is bunk. Look where they put the back wound on their cartoon and then find the color photo of JFK's shirt at maryferrel.org--There's where the back wound was (over 5 down from the collar)and how could a bullet enter that far down on the man's back and exit his throat.ABC cuts Maclom Kildoff's press conference reply to a question where he answer's,""..It was a simple matter, Tom, of a bullet right through the head..."" But ABC cuts the film before Mr. Kildoff points to his right temple, indicating a shot from the front.Isn't it strange that there have been no documentries on the JFK assassination that expose the ""Single Bullet Fraud"" on any main-stream tv channels!?!? What are they afraid of? Buy ""The Murder of JFK: A Revisionist History"" dvd instead.The Murder of JFK: A Revisionist History"
4,nice clean story,It's the story of a little girl named Merry who goes to America from London to stay with relatives until World War 2 war ends. She really misses her family back home. While she is living with her aunt and uncle she has many adventures. She gets to go on a picnic with her friends at school. She also goes to a birthday party. Read Primrose Day to find out all about Merry and her adventures.What did you like or not like about the book?The book is full of good old fashion fun. No violence or bad words are found in this book. Kids respect the adults as well. More books like these should be written today.I would recommend this book to kids who are just starting out with chapter books. The chapters are not too long and not too short. It would also make a good read aloud to classrooms.
5,The funniest book in the history of the world,"I read this book when it first came out and now over 25 years later I have come looking for it. This book is so carefully thought out that you can look at it for many, many hours and still be finding new hilarious details. It is as if the book were written by the God of High School."
3,NOT the best book ever.,"Normally, I wouldn't bother with a review. But frankly, I bought this book because of the overwhelming 5-star support for Blade: Shellville High School Yearbook.Well, a 5-star book is it NOT. The Betty Fulton poem and maybe half of the captions are moderately funny. An occasional sheep photo is chuckle-worthy. However, the comments about this book being ""sidesplitting funny"" are erroneous in my opinion. For the $6.95 posted price on the cover, it ""might"" be worth that kind of expenditure. But for the $70 I paid, I definitely got robbed.In closing, this book WILL make you smile and occasionally laugh. It's not a terrible book, just definitely not a 5-star."
5,Great taste!,The spice arrived fresh and there is a lot of it. It is a MUST for Middle Eastern cooking! Great taste!
5,Good price and good product,"Just what I needed. Large quantity at good price. Fine flavor. Would def get it again, you will see soon."
5,Citrusy,"Imparts a nice citrus taste to your dishes. Used before lemons were introduced to the Mediterranean. Grilled Chicken, pork etc."
4,Only For Diana,"When the whole world heard about the tragic death of Diana: Princess of Wales, it became one of the most tragic events ever in the history of England. She was a very close friend of Elton John particularly, and it even shown in Candle In The Wind 1997. The song was heartbreaking and just completely sad, as a tribute for somebody who stood out for all of the world to love. For the other song, Something Anout The Way You Look Tonight, it was a great launching pad for The Big Picture record. Although The Big Picture did alright, this single stood out further, and became the biggest-selling single in music history. It really is one of the most powerful songs ever, period."
5,There can be only one,"There have been many songs that have been interpreted different ways. I think both of these songs are about the late princess Diana. Many songs of his remind me of her, like Blue Eyes and others, but these two are hers. They will forever be hers, as she will forever be in our hearts."
1,Overpricing of this CD,"I have a copy of this CD that I purchased for $2.95 in 1997 when the tribute came out. I, too, was disappointed that Elton John rehashed an old song for his tribute to Princess Diana. I was expecting something original, too. I still have the CD in it's original packaging, still shrink-wrapped, never opened with the original price tag still on. How can you sell this now for such a high price? $7.95? Really?? Looks like the price was rehashed, too. I am not keeping my copy. I am donating it to charity along with some other household items."
5,amazing voice,Steve Amerson has an amazing voice. Not all of his output is religious music -- some cuts are show tunes and he also sings patriotic songs.Give him a try!
5,Best Digital SLR for the money,"After four months I am convinced this is the finest digital SLR for this price. You can pay more, but why? I got the D200 with the Nikkor 18-200mm lens. This is Nikon's best wide angle to telephoto zoom lens and it is the camera's weakest link. I'm surprised that Nikon has priced this camera body for just $1500. You will not be disappointed if you purchase this camera."
5,"Great camera, a little misleading info on Amazon","Just got the camera and from what I've seen so far it is a wonderful piece of equipment. My only complaint is that Amazon misrepresented the battery type saying it is, ""powered by EN-EL3a or EN-EL3"" which is not true and disappointing to anyone who is upgrading from a camera that does use those batteries (ie D70) The D200 uses the EN-EL3e which doesn't have the same fit as the EN-EL3a or EN-EL3.Be aware of this if you are upgrading!"
5,Still relevant today!!!,There is a lot of hype that goes into purchasing a DSLR camera and everyone is always toting the next and best thing. The bottom line is that the Nikon D200 is a great camera in 2012. If you are looking for a camera to take great pictures and you want something a better than a point and shoot...I wouldn't even hesitate to pick up one of these and get a nice lens for around $100 to go with it.
2,Not a Winner in My Book!,"I have owned this camera since it first came out. My one big comment is NOISE - NOISE - NOISE! If you don't have a noise reduction program such as Dfine, you will not be happy with your images."
1,Nikon D200 - Inherent manufacturing issues,"I purchased this Nikon D200 with the 18- 135 lens, and thought it was a fantastic camera, that is, until the auto focus decided to no longer work at 11 months old.It appears that the D200 has an inherent fault in the auto focus, and Nikon are not doing a recall, and in my case refuse to fix it under warranty.So I am very disappointed with this camera, very disappointed with Nikon, and would never buy another Nikon product due to their lack of product support"
4,Well I've been using mine for the past 4 years,"and there still isn't too much to complain about. Granted, I had a few occasions where I've used a Cannon 5D Mark II and it blew my baby out of the water but I feel comparing the two is just unfair.One of the things that needs to be understood about the D200 is that it is designed to shoot images for editing in RAW. If you do not want to take the time to do minor sharpening and edits in Adobe RAW this probably isn't for you. Of course I have the same complaint as everyone else thats ever used this. The noise is awful. Forget about shooting anything over ISO 400. If you find yourself shooting mainly in studios or with location lighting this should not be an issue."
1,Sumerian Culture dvd.,"This dvd is not worth the $19.- I paid for it. It is a one hour presentation of a poorly prepared lecture that was presented in a way that made you think the presenter had to hurry up or he would not be able to finish his speech in the time that they had rented the room for. The background noise that came through from a presentation that was held in another adjacent room was disturbing and distracting. The pictures, these were all pctures that this dvd showed, were of poor quality and were not long enough left on the screen to look at it properly; like I mentioned before, it looked as of the presenter was afraid that they would run out of time ! Some of the same pictures shown in the so called bonus part of this dvd were of much and much better quality, but there were ONLY a couple of extra pictures that this ""bonus"" program presented. In my opinion this dvd is not much more worth than about maybe $2.50 , so don't waste your money !"
5,LorAnn Oils,"Excellent product, arrived in great condition & fast shipping. No problems. Will order from them again, thanks for a great product."
2,Not for Western Gardeners,"All of the Taylor books seem to be written for non-western gardens. I have 4 of their books and yet whenever I want to look up a plant I've seen in a nursery I rarely find it in these books. This is not the book you want if you are hoping for a good resource for roses. This is a guide book, when you want to look up a rose you saw at a nursery to find out a little more about it. The book divides the roses by class so if you are like most people and looking to buy a hybrid tea this book has fewer than 100. There are thousands and thousands of roses on the market, the odds that you will find it in this book is nil unless you are looking for Peace or the most common. This is a small book, you could spend your money better elsewhere. I recommend Botanica's Encyclopedia of Roses."
3,A useful if not exhaustive resource,"The Taylor's Guide to Roses is, like its companion volumes, handy to have around as a supplement to other books on roses. In itself it is neither complete nor entirely reliable; however, its many attractive photos are useful, especially for people who are not familiar with the various classifications of roses. I particularly appreciate that it gives equal space to old roses, shrub roses, and species, as the round of hybrid teas grows tiresome to the eye and these plants deserve far more garden space than they receive.Overall, best used as a visual aid for form--color, as in any book, is subject to the vagaries of nature and photography."
2,This movie was seriously lacking,This movie was wack. The acting was just bad and there was no plot to speak of. It was all over the place with no resolution at the end. Mobb Deep should really stick to music.
3,Alright,"I would only recommend this for Mobb fans only. It's okay to me because I am a Mobb fan but, to Hip-Hop lovers they may not like it because, the acting sucks as well as the production."
3,Decent Start at Filmmaking by Prodigy of Mobb Deep,"If you seriously thought that ""Murda Muzik"" was going to be something like a Hollwyood quality film then you were expecting WAAAYYYY too much. There was not going to be a deep story line with character development with award winning writing and cinematography. This movie was an underground indie flick made by a first time filmmaker with his friends about the ""hood"" for a bunch of rap fans. Prodigy of Mobb Deep wrote the script and financed the movie himself. It was entertaining and you were introduced to other members of the Mobb Deep family. There was a storyline (an aspiring rapper, Fresh, who is mixed up between the music business and the streets) but it did get a bit lost as the movie went into tangents here and there. All in all, given the obvious constraint on movie making resources, it was a pretty good tale.P.S. If you wanted a real movie, then Prodigy would've needed serious $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ for something like that."
1,Good value if free with free shipping...,"...otherwise, stay away. The vertical swivel lock does not lock tight and there is no detent for horizontal. Your camera can, at best, point slightly up or slightly down. Monumental design flaw.Useless."
3,Weak and won't hold much weight,"Weak and won't hold much weight. Not for a DSLR, even with the smallest of lenses."
1,Waste of money!,I took this tripod out of the package and as soon as I touched one of the legs it snapped off. I tried gluing the leg back on but it didn't work. My tripod is now a bipod and it's now completely useless.
1,Better off using a couple of pebbles,"My camera is a Panasonic DMC-FZ10; this tripod doesn't begin to support. About only use is lying flat/wedging under the camera to level on uneven or angled surfaces. Even if it were more sturdy, the slick leg-bottoms preclude use on car hood etc."
1,not worth a flip,"Horrible. I bought this two years ago for my old Sony camcorder which I admit is bulky and heavy - fell right to the ground. I recently tried to give it another shot with my superlight, supersmall digital camera - the camera might as well have been a cement block - the tripod would not support it for a millisecond. DO NOT BUY."
1,Not worth buying,"I want to say up front that I did not buy this from Amazon, I got it for free through another source. Even for free it's not worth the 3 cents worth of parts to put it together. Even the Chinese should be embarrassed over this piece of work! Absolutely awful product, stay clear."
3,Get the import!,"Bow Wow Wow have some great tunes, but my favorites are all on the IMPORT The Best of Bow Wow Wow, not this domestic version. The import has the original versions, which I prefer. The tracks on the domestic CD are overproduced and play like ""extended disco versions""."
4,Can't wait to hear these songs live,"Several of these songs start out a bit ""disappointing"" then take some unexpected turns that are just phenomenal - especially Durar Hasta al Final, y Hotel Malibu. I have seen La Ley already 5x en vivo and think that some of these tracks will play live as well or better than anything they have ever written. Beto's voice is at its peak. The only reason I didn't give it 5* is that a few songs leave me uninspired."
2,a little weak,"I only like AMATE Y SALVATE, MAS ALLA and other tre tracks more but that's it.typical la ley's album, only thre songs are hits, the rest is not good, not even average music but i will still buy this album because the little good songs that they have are great."
1,Esto le llaman Rock en Español? Muy mal ejemplo!,"Que le ha pasado a La Ley? Que le paso a su musica? Ahora es toda prefabricada y comercial. La verdad es que despues de ""Invisible"" solo ha sabido decepcionar. El Unplugged les regresa un poco de credibilidad pero ahora con ""Libertad"" han regresado al piso como cuando lo estaban con ""Uno"". Por suerte yo no compre este disco si no que me prestaron para escucharlo y la verdad es que era lo que me esperaba. Musiquilla malisima que sirve para atrapar a toda gente que solo escucha lo que pega en la radio y no le pone atencion a lo que SI EN REALIDAD ES MUSICA. Me da mucha pena que Mikel Erentxun haya escogido a Beto Cuevas para la cancion ""Dias"". Tambien me da muchisima pena que grupos con bastante talento y que tocan VERDADERO ROCK no reciben mas reconocimiento como Lucybell y Los Tres (Chilenos). La Ley deberia regresar a sus dias del buen rock que tocaban (pre 1995) y dejar esta porqueria comercial en las que estan sumergidos."
5,CANADA LOVES LA LEY!!!!,"Hailing from Toronto ON, Canada, there is very little exposure to this extremely talented group, La Ley! Watching the Latin Billboards the other night, I was fortunate enough to watch them perform and it was then that I discovered this fantastic band! It is VERY unfortunate that they haven't toured Canada as I am sure there are many fans like me here!!!! Their music ROCKS!!!! I highly recommend this album from start to finish. Although I am not spanish, I can feel ""Beto's"" words and expressions through his artistry and vocalist of this amazing band!!!! I HIGHLY RECCOMEND THIER MUSIC TO EVERYONE!!!!COME TO CANADA!!!!"
5,chevere,"Desde que supe sobre La Ley ase dies anos e estado fasinado con el estilo de la banda i la musica. Este album que sacaron se nota que la banda no cree en quedarse con la boca callada. Tanbien se puede decir que La Ley lo puede hacer en diferentes estilos musicales. El album Libertad es ecepsional, con diferentes temas que tocan diferentes leyes."
3,Diferente,"Este disco de La Ley es diferente a ""Uno"" e ""Invisible"". Basicamente, ""Libertad"" elimina los sonidos electronicos y se concentra mas en baladas que otra cosa. Despues de excelentes discos como ""Uno"" e ""Invisible"", yo considero que ""Libertad"" tiene quiza 3 canciones muy buenas (muy unicas), pero el resto no es nada especial. El comienzo del disco con la cancion ""Amate y Salvate"" es fenomenal y lleno de energia, pero de alli en adelante es bastante lento y lineal."
1,disappointing,"I am La Ley's #1 fan but that does not stops me to say that This new album has no quality as the previous albums. It is well intended, but most of the songs have no rhythm. The could have just released poem tracks instead, the music is patheteic. ""Intentar Amar and Mentira"" themselves are better than this whole album. this sounds more like a new youth band with only a cuple of song to offer.i am so outraged and dissapointed! La Ley's super days have come to an end."
2,This is not a good book for understanding PPP,"This book is just a little more than a piecing together of the RFC's. Comparing with Richard Stevens' book about TCP/IP protocols, this book can be scaled to only one star. I gave this book two stars only because this is the only book I can find about PPP."
1,white xmas,"took awhile to get it.. fed-ex did not bring it to my door, sat in the office for about 5 days before i got it. mark was nice at christmas central. he wanted to make things right. will see in the furure..have not opened it up yet so i can't give you a rating yet.you have to open it in 48 hours. i did not get it for days........."
3,Christmas Tree,"Tree is what I expected with the exception of the lights. I didn't want the colored lights so I took them off. Would need to do this anyway as half did not work. Removing the lights is very difficult. They had two sets completely intertwined and made it very difficult to remove. Otherwise, tree is nice."
5,"If you like Tool & Licoln Park, You will love these guys!","I listen to pivot's newest cd before I go to the gym. In years past I always listened to Metallica and AC/DC. Those groups are still the great ones, although Pivot might not have the recognition yet, but they are every bit as enjoyable to listen to. I have even spoke to eric from the group to put there music in my next movie."
1,1 star for winter shots,"camerawork kills this film...the majority of scenes have closeup views, intentional out-of-focus shots, and indoor lighting issues that really are a diservice to viewing. it's dizzy, fuzzy, and microscopic, and it could have been a great film!...tsk-tsk guys"
4,Good enough.,"We got this product to take close up photography of items for online auction. It is fairly well built and comes with a black or white backdrop and a carrying/storage case. There are no directions as the previous reviewer said, and it does reduce shadows as long as you have adequate lighting and/or have a flash that can be repositioned so as not to create reflections or shadows. The only drawback is that it built in such a way that you'll need to build a stand or put a stand inside to mount items for taking photos; the nylon is very slick and does not rest flat so it is difficult to keep them in position unless you mount or position items on a different surface in the tent. The low price for a starter photography tent makes up for a lot!"
5,super for close-up/macro photography,"This is my first light tent. For the price, it is wonderful. Even at full price, it is worth the money if you photograph jewelry, food, coins, toys or other products (or anything else that will fit in the tent). Two words: no shadows.I don't know how much of my satisfaction is the joy of using a light tent and how much is this XPRO light tent. [...].My XPRO light tent did not come with the green backdrop shown but did have a white and a black backdrop that attach with their own Velcro strips. They unwrinkle well in a clothes dryer.If you only need a small tent or just want to experiment with shadow-free photography, this is a great buy. Its low price gets it 5 stars despite its lack of instructions."
5,Pup Treads are great,We received the items before they were expected and my pups loved them!! I would recommend them to my friends.
1,Terrible,"I got the toy in the mail much later than it was supposed to be delivered and it was not the material I was expecting. I thought the tire would actually be made like a small tire, it was really just a super flimsy rubber My dog had it shredded in under a day."
5,angie,I got this for my 4 month old dachshund. He lovesto chew and is very hard on his toys. This haslasted well and he really loves it. It is funnyto watch him play with it.
5,AWESOME TOY! SAVES FURNITURE!,"Our Labrador Retriever puppy would say to you that this is his favorite toy, but he cannot talk ( that I know of! ). As many dogs may decide to ingest the rubber instead of leave it on the floor ( which is what mine does! ), as long as you supervise the use of this toy it is AWESOME!!! AWESOME!!! Always protect a dog who loves to chew by putting the dog inside a crate while you are unable to supervise or are not at home."
4,Not as good as past seasons,"For those of you that have watched all the pervious seasons, this season will be a bit of a disappointment. It was still enjoyable. Over use of naked people. It was funny at first, but even got on my husband's nerves at the end."
1,horrible,A complete waste of time. It was hard to figure out what they were attempting to convey. Quite simply pointless.
2,Shame,It's a shame that there is so much offensive language because there is god information. I can't recommend this to my friends or share it with my children.
5,Excellent.,"If you like Penn & Teller, and have any familiarity with this show, you'll definitely want to own this modern classic. In fact, get them all!"
5,Ties For Best Season With Season 1,"Demolishes draconian ""moral standards,"" concerning prostitution, beautifully documents the utter failure and deception of abstinence ""education,"" deals with the death penalty in a thought-provoking manner, and sheds light on how the Boy Scouts have become a hateful religious cult.All this in highly entertaining season! Highly, highly recommended!Weakest episode: ""Pet Love."" But even that one is great!"
2,Not recomended,"This book is horrible in understanding Lab Math. It does help in some areas such as molarity, but the solution dilutions and trying to decipher what they want in the word problems are very difficult."
3,Proverbs by Roland Cap Ehlke,"I knew that I was getting a used book, but that suited me just fine. I don't need a brand new copy. The book arrived in the shape in which it was advertized. I am completely satisfied."
5,Very interesting read!!,"Condition as described, shipped fast!! Super book for insight into Mrs. McCullers. Helps to explain her life and made me want to read more of her books."
3,Impossible to be unbiased,"After reading the play and reading the reviews at this site, I have come to realize that any person connected with the Catholic faith will object to the history behind this play. Denial is an interesting phenomenon, and everyone uses ""facts"" to support their beliefs. Perhaps the silence of the Pope is denied because people find it impossible to believe he would be. Perhaps he did do more to save Jews then the play leads one to believe, but in a quiet, in the background kind of way. Many historians, Jewish or otherwise, attest to the fact that the Pope did not openly condemn Hitler and Nazi activities. It is a sad commentary that people are unable to admit guilt by silence, we can see that its acceptance is continued all over the world today. Too bad we can't learn from history's lessons."
5,Denial Adds To Guilt,"""The Deputy"" is based on documented factual history. In what may be a matter of loyalty to their faith, some Amazon reviewers have claimed that Pope Pius II DID speak out.Such loyalty is understandable when the actions by a leader of one's religious faith are being examined. Hochhuth's vehicle both causes AND thwarts their denial.Historic objectivity very often conflicts with religion and faith.There is far more evidence of Vatican appeasement and toleration of the Nazi movement prior to and during World War II than any protesting. ""The Deputy"" merely dramatizes some of this.Hochhuth's dramatizing of history does not render it fallacious."
1,Anti-Catholic Slander from Johns Hopkins,"I wonder if Johns Hopkins University Press would publish the ""Protocols of the Elders of Zion"" or ""The Klansman"" or any other works of bald-faced Hate and Bigotry? Of course not, because such ""literature"" is unworthy of publication by any university press. Yet Johns Hopkins sees no problem with publishing ""The Deputy"", a slanderous, FICTIONAL play about Pope Pius XII, written in the early 60s by an anti-Catholic German Protestant, who, presumably, was seeking to absolve the blood-drenched soul of his native country by shifting the blame for the Holocaust to the leader of the Catholic Church, several million of whose members also perished in the deathcamps at the hands of jackbooted creeps from the author's own Germany. For a GERMAN to blame the Holocaust on the Catholic Church is not merely absurd, it is sickening. It is amazing how the cancer of anti-Catholicism thrives in our American universities. How long must Catholics put up with Intolerance?"
1,"Embarrassing, historically obtuse, obsolete","Some works of literature wear well with time, and some do not.Understandably, The Deputy was quite a red-hot item 40 years ago, when there was a certain frisson in criticizing a recently-deceased Pope, and not a great deal of historical work had been done to analyze the opposition of the Catholic Church against Hitlerism.But now, at the beginning of the 21st Century, a wealth of actual documentary evidence can take the place of the fictitious imaginings, sceptical conjectures, and whole-cloth fabrications which make up the basis of this play.At the time of its writing, it must havce seemed daring and challenging in a disturbing but healthy sense. Now it looks more like, at best, sophomoric propaganda, and at worst, like a new and deeply unattractive variation on Blood Libel."
2,its nice,"It's a big watch. At first i thought that the seconds keep scrolling was kinda cool but then after a while i just stopped looking at the watch all together. It gets really annoying. And then recently the second scrolling thing broke and now it's just a grey screen, so now i use the watch again as it was meant to be used. I should have returned it."
5,Great motivation for any athlete or would-be athlete!,"I spend a lot of time training in the martial arts, and am always on the lookout for information (books, articles, advice) that will help me get the most out of every workout. Sometimes it's hard to keep the right mental attitude and keep your training moving in the right direction. In Train Tough, author Mark Bender definitely kicks your butt into gear and gets you motivated to challenge yourself, overcome counterproductive attitudes, and truly see what you can do in your athletic pursuits. He trained 10,000+ soldiers for Operation Desert Storm--so I think he's amply qualified to get the rest of us off the couch and out of our less-than-effective training ruts. I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to be a better athlete, no matter what level they are at, or which sport they do. BUY IT!"
5,from Texas,Purchased this item because I got tired of my manuel stapler to reupholster my patio chares.this stapler worked great right out of the box. Great for small projects that you would usualy use a manuel stapler that uses arrow T-50 staples with out all the frustration of a manuel stapler.
4,"Light, fun, and efficient","The first one I bought fired too many blanks, then jammed. A staple lodged within the ""hammer/pusher"" and despite repeated attempts, I could not remove it. I sent the unit back for a replacement. The second unit has operated flawlessly, using the same staples as the first (Arrow 3/8"" T50s). I use the Surebonder with a 1-hp, 1 gal Senco compressor (PC-1010) to staple photos-on-canvas to stretcher-strip frames. It has turned a tedious job into one of fun and efficiency. This item would have got 5 stars had not the first one been faulty."
5,Great value,"The staple gun arrived as stated in description, appeared to be brand new as marked. So far I have had no issues and I am very satisfied with purchase. It is a powerful staple gun and seems to shoot well."
1,Never Worked,"Amazing to me, Amazon shipped the wrong staples with the gun and after getting the right staples, the gun would not operate. I knew it was a bargain, but oiled or not, not one staple. Returned. I got a lemon. The lucky ones got one that works."
3,Crown Stapler Testimony,"The product did not work straight out of the box. I had to read the instructions till I found that my problem was not covered. At that point I started taking it apart ... a little to find that the trigger has a safety feature ""Lock Out"" that prevents it from firing unless the safety bar is compressed. This action tripped the catch on the trigger to prevent it from being squeezed a second time. I did figure that using a small screwdriver released the lock out clip under the trigger. Once I did this it worked well for about 12 staples till the main ""hammer"" seized in the down position. I freed it up a few times and it seems to work well now. I was driving staples into plywood reupholstering a seat. It should last me a decade whereas it's just used as a hobby tool. I'm not convinced this is a commercial quality tool, yet for the price it's perfect for my use."
4,Oils well that ends well.,"The first one of these staplers seized on me after about 200 staples. I dutifully added several drops of oil before using it and had the pressure about 90 psi.I returned it without difficulty (thanks Amazon!)and the replacement has worked flawlessly. On the second one I added MUCH more oil, however. I would guess that the tolerances on these staplers are wide due to the low price and the need for oil is increased.Overall, great stapler when it works!"
3,good for the price,"This stapler, like most inexpensive tools, is not that precisely crafted, however, it functions reasonably well given it's price. It does occasionally misfire and jam, but overall it allowed me to rescreen my porch much more quickly than I could have with a manual stapler, and was less expensive than an electric stapeler ( if you already own a compressor). If I made my living stapling, I would be hard pressed to say that buying 4 of these is a worse investment than the single bostich stapler that money could buy me (cheap chinese labor discussions aside)."
1,Used gun - not new - doesn't even work!,"WOW! This is a first for me on Amazon. I don't think I have ever gotten used goods before when buying new (at least that I was aware of). How horrible to rip someone off with a used item, and it doesn't even work!"
3,Great idea but...,"We ordered this staple gun to recover dining room chairs. The first gun we received did not push the staple out properly, in fact it only put out a burst of air from the air compressor. We ordered a replacement which worked much better. It certasinly was way easier than using a regular heavy duty stapler."
1,D.O.A. X 2 (Dead On Arrival),"I ordered this Surebond 9600 Pneumatic Narrow Crown Stapler from Amazon.Surebonder 9600 Pneumatic Narrow Crown Stapler with Carrying CaseWhen I hooked it up to the air line, nothing worked. There are no working controls on this except for the air exhaust, so I contacted Amazon, and they immediately sent a replacement while I returned this one. When I went to use the replacement, it didn't work either. I sent it back for a fullrefund. Amazon.com is great and has great service. This stapler is not a product that I want. I would have given it 0 stars, but that is not an option. 1 star is ""I hate it"". I eventually purchaded a similar item grom Harbor Freight and am verry happy with it."
2,worked for the first box of staples now it misfires allot.,I guess you get what you pay for...plastic part broke first time I used it and it misfires allot now after only one box of staples.
1,wrong staples,"You know where it says ""frequently bought with""? And then there's some staples listed? DO NOT ORDER THOSE!! They won't fit. Look closely and get the #4 staples, not the 22 gauge. RRRRR!!! It's not worth the $5 postage to mail $8 staples back...I feel dumb & snookered."
3,Got ripped off. Ordered new product and recieved it used!!!!!,"I ordered a NEW staple gun and expected to receive a NEW staple gun. When it arrived it looked used and/or refurbished. The part that is suppose to attached to the compressor hose is crooked and looked like someone tried prying it off, and the part where you staple has many scratches like someone used it (my husband took pictures of this on his phone.) I would've returned it if I didn't need it so badly. FEEL RIP OFF!!! so can't really give an accurate review due to sketchy product."
1,You don't even get what you paid for!,"This thing was DOA. The trigger was not assembled right. It would not depress. It's so cheaply put together that I just took the trigger apart and reinstalled it correctly.After that, every time I pressed the trigger, all I got was air leaking from the valve under the trigger. Never got to fire a single staple!It had signs that it had been used and was probably a return in the first place.So frustrating to pay for a ""deal"", wait for it, then it doesn't work. Just went to Home Depot and picked one up that was only $7.00 more...and it worked! Imagine that!A product, no matter how inexpensive, should not have such a bad failure rate, and be DOA. At least work for a while!"
2,Miss-fire,I had to send the first one back as it did not work at all out of the box. I called the company and they were slow on the response or with providing a RMA. I returned it through Amazon and they did a great job of getting me a replacement and returning the defective one.
4,Surebonder 9600,This stapler is mdestly priced. I have used it on two projects and it has done great. It did not misfire once and I would recommend it to anyone.
1,Hammer jams,"The stapler worked well for a few days. We used it to re-upholster our chairs. However, the hammer (the part that strikes the staple) started to jam in the open position and would not retract. We'd force the hammer to retract using a slotted tip screwdriver (it didn't require much force at all, we just prodded it back to position). This happened even though we added oil to the tool as the manual had stated."
5,Air stapler,I bought this stapler to use with my pancake air compressor. No regrets here ! Works wonderfully ! Staples are easy to find at true value stores and the gun is quality made. Great gun for upholstery and light wood work like fixing screens and attaching light moldings. I have used this gun to upholster boat seats and and sewing machine benches with no problems at all. Make sure you use a drop of oil in the air fitting on gun every time that you use it so that if there is any water in your compressor it won't damage the internals of the gun. Highly recommended. Great price with free and quick shipping !!!
3,Surebonder Pneumatic Staple Gun,Staple gun is fine. The staples shipped with staple gun did not fit. Disappointed!!!! Had to go out and buy different staples.
1,disappointed,"Damn thing wouldn't work. Called tech support several times. She said I needed to have put oil in it before I started to use it. That is buried in the manual and not included in ""preparing for use"". I put oil in it after I had tried unsuccessfully several times, but I guess that was too late. I'm in the middle of a project for somebody and mad."
3,Good light weight stapler,"What I really like about this stapler is that it's light weight and for what it is meant, it's perfect. I've used it so far for ""HomeWrap"", with 1/2"" staples and it works perfect.However, what teed me off is that, when I buy a new item I expect to receive a new one and not something that has cosmetic touch up, which wasn't done very good ! Had I not needed the stapler, I would have send it back.Surebonder 9600 Pneumatic Fine Wire Staple Gun with Carrying Case"
4,Beware: wrong staples!,Watch out! The staples shown in the package section (Other people bought....)do not fit this stapler! Search for Surebonder #4 staples and make sure they are compatible with the 9600.
4,Solid Performer So Far,Great price for what it does. Used for one job so far. I had to replace some ceiling tiles and this did the job without a hitch. Highly recommended.
3,You get what you pay for,"I have always known that you generally get what you pay for, and this is an instance of that. This is a $20 stapler, and it performs like a $20 stapler. I actually had to send the first one back because the ram stopped functioning, so I am on my second one. Prior to it breaking, this is what I didn't like:1. The staples jammed VERY frequently - I was using Arrow T-50 staples, which it says are compatible.2. I had many staples that did not seat properly, some that would break.3. Several staples would actually fall out after shooting one4. The ram broke after about 500 staples.This is what I liked:1. Inexpensive2. Compatible with Arrow t-50 staples3. Easy to useIf the second one is better/worse, I will update this review, as I have only shot 45 staples out of it, and it worked perfectly so far."
1,surebonder,The stapler I got skips a lot... i was not even able put one box of staples through it ... Not a good product... Don't buy...
1,It stopped working in short time,"I was hoping it will last but after stapling 3 seats (<200 staples), it jammed. I could see the staple but was unable to extract it. Luckily I purchased it here as I am returning it tomorrow. Maybe I am expecting more from $25 but I expected to go beyond 200 staples."
4,incredible for the price,"It misses the occasional staple (like 1/15), but for the money it's incredible. I can't really see spending 5X unless I start doing upholstery full-time (perish the thought!)."
5,A bargain,Don't waste your money anywhere else this is a great product that should last you a long time; over 20000 staples and still going strong. Don't bother with electric staplers they are garbage. My only recommendation is to make sure to regulate the pressure under 90psi I had it at 85psi and to oil before every use. My only problem with the product......... Made in China.
5,Good staple gun,"Works great. No problems. Would recommend. Carrying case is nice and sturdy. Even came with a few staples to get you started. 1 word of caution, don't shoot staples from it, only fire the gun into something. If you shoot staples in the air, the gun will jam. You aren't supposed to do this anyway and it is dangerous."
5,Great Gun For The Price,My Arrow hand gun would not drive a 1/4 inch staple thru a leather seat cover to its plastic base. This Surebonder gun had no problem doing it.Great gun for the price.
5,STAPLE GUN,"This staple gun is perfect for me. It is easy to load,very inexpensive,easy to handle & works great. I use it to put up RadiantBarrier Foil in the rafters of attics. I even bought another one to speed up my work. I have only had it for a month now so i cant tell you if it will last or not."
5,Worth it!,Bought it to upholster a chair and it was so easy to use and staples went in hard maple with no problem. Saved so much time compared to my old staple gun.
4,Outstanding value.,"I used it to re-upholster a motorcycle seat, and it worked great. No problems. Don't expect the fit and finish of a precision-engineered tool; remember this tool was made as cheaply as possible. However, you can expect it to perform very well for the price."
4,Nice Cheap Stapler,Not a bad stapler but not for this price of $32.99. I live in the mid-west and just purchased this same gun from Menards on sale for $9.99 after a $5.00 mail in rebate (Crazy Price)! For that price I actually bought two of them. Their regular price is only $24.99 so the price here is really quite high especially when you add shipping.
1,Not good!,"I bought the surebonder to build canvas stretchers with, using 1x3's, so nothing too major. It worked like a charm the first day, but the second time, it just stopped working. I called the surebonder hotline and talked to a representative who was nice and helpful but, after deciding that it couldn't be easily fixed by shipping me a new part, she told me I would have to return it to where I bought it. I might have given it another shot, but Amazon's policy is not to replace items that come from another vendor. They did promptly refund me though."
1,Works for awhile,I purchased this stapler and shot around 2000 staples and then the driver broke. It was cheaper to buy another stapler than to buy the repair parts which I did. Again after stapling up insulation for a remodel project the driver in this gun broke also. I have emailed Surebonder with no response.Probably a great tool for small projects but I wouldn't plan on it lasting very long.I guess you get what you pay for. I will not be purchasing another.
1,New/Used,I ordered this as new and when I received this item it was clearly used and did not work properly Simular ones may work fine but not this one.
2,You get what you pay for.,"It looks nice in the photo, but don't kid yourself, it does not have the same build quality as a Porter Cable or any other big brand product. The case is very cheap plastic and hardly worth having. I gave it two stars only because it does drive a staple. Overall, it's okay for an occasional project but I would not recommend this if you plan to use it as a professional."
2,Trigger continuously malfunctions,"I am disappointed with this staple gun as the trigger mechanism slips out of place after about every five or six staples. I have to use a screwdriver to force the trigger back into position in order for it to work again. I would have returned the unit but I needed it to complete an upholstery project for which I had a timeline. I would definitely not recommend buying this product.I had read other reviews which were positive, so perhaps I just received a lemon??"
4,Works very well and a good value,"You can sense that this tool is made with a bit low tolerances , but that said Ive never had a jam.and just add a bit extra oil on use... It also benefits for adding oil directly to the staple magazine slot..."
3,So far so good,"In the thousand or so staples this has worked as I expected. I am putting the oil in by hand every stick or two of staples, for even if I had an oiler handy, putting it inline within 13 feet of the stapler as it asks would be impossible for installing the webbing to support cellulose insulation. I hope that it lasts. It has so far given no indication that it will not. The trigger is sensitive enough that I double sometimes."
1,BAD,Arrived on time price was to good to be true because it is junk pluged in shot 1 staple stuck unpluged air shot another staple wont work anymore JUNK
1,pro woodworker,"The superbonder 9600 is just what you pay for a cheeeep staplgun. I bougt it to reuppolster dining chairs. Don't pull the trigger untyill it is under full ai presure or the trigger jams ,the periodicly throut use it jams (trigger stick and will not fire till you unhook from air and push the saer back up.PAIN IN THE NECK) DISAPOINTING TOOL!Is still faster than a spring gun.Surebonder 9600 Pneumatic Fine Wire Staple Gun with Carrying Caseextra stapels did not fit gun!"
4,works great,I did a upholstery project with this and it worked great. I think it's great that it takes standard t50 staples. I insulated a couple of rooms the other day and wish I brought it with me. only downside is it doesn't hold a lot of staples.
5,My new favorite air tool!,"I don't normally write reviews on the products I buy but I will definitely make an exception for this one. This is the best bang for the buck in air tools - bar none! I own six pneumatic guns now and this is now my favorite. Very good quality, very precise, simple to use, much safer and cheaper than a swing hammer stapler. I have used over twenty thousand staples so far while insulating my house and it has been an absolute life saver. I am now thinking of all the things I can use this for. I would buy another and feel good about it if it quit working today."
4,Well worth it!,"Feels pretty solid, and well worth the cost (~$17) to avoid awkward manual staple guns while doing upholstery work. Lever behind trigger catches below it now and again, but you just move that back into place, and back in business. Overall, very satisfied with purchase, and would recommend it."
1,While it lasted.......,"Did a pretty good job ...... as long as it lasted..... which was 7.5 months of very intermittent (8 to 10 times) use. Last week, was using it, went to refill another line of staples, and it was dead. Did a disassembly to see if anything was wrong - all of the O rings, the gasket and plunger are all in one piece. I then called the manufacturer. First of all, was told it had only a 90 day warranty. Wrong, it's a year. The woman in their customer service said she would email instructions on returning it for repairs - 6 days later, no email, no phone call, no snail mail. Yes, she asked for and has all of the addresses. Looks like it's going to take a one way trip to the scrap barrel at the dump unless a miracle happens."
2,"works, but not well","I bought this product to staple a quarter inch oak back board to a couple projects I'm building. The stapler shoots staples out fine, but they won't penetrate quarter inch oak ply wood. This stapler would probably work well for apolstry.Also when I received the stapler with the machine oil, the machine oil was packaged open and half of it had squeezed out all over the place in transit. I didn't have to worry about oiling the stapler that was soaked on arrival. What a mess!"
2,Instant frustration,I am a senior. I have been using tools all my life. This thing will frustrate you. You drive a few staples and the staple compartment pops open. Dumping the staples out the bottom. Which you have to stop and pick up. Usually while you are trying to hold something in place. I think it is the vibration of stapling that releases the latch.This tools latch is poorly designed. I should have had deeper penetration (always works better.) and required that you push the staple bar in before it will unlatch. I also tried to restrain the latch with a rubber band. It still came undone only just a little so the staples would not drive but an eighth of an inch. It got the job done but it took every bad word I had.Also be sure you get the staples that fit the stapler you buy. Go to the manufactures web site to check.
3,too many jamups,"This gun has more power than an eletric stapler, unfortunatly it jams up quite a bit. We purchased it for a uphosterly project and it jams continuosly. I expected more based on other reviews. Would not reccomend."
5,Surebonder 9600 Pneumatic Narrow Crown Stapler with Carrying Case,"Great little stapler.Ready to use out of box.Few oil drops before each use , load staples ,connect airline 90psi and u are ready to go.Works very good, no problems reported.Not even 1 single jam after 5000 staples.Great buy for it's price.Full recomendation.Must have tool.5+ stars"
4,Good value,"The item appears to be a good value. It uses the common T-50 staples, which are available anywhere and has the power to drive staples into a plastic seat pan on a motorcycle. The only complaint that I have about it is that it came with an ""industrial"" air fitting installed. I removed it to install an ""automotive"" air fitting and had to re-tap the inlet fitting to accept it. It appears that the 8 year old in the 3rd world country that built the stapler doesn't know how to use a NPT tap. No problem, I had a 1/4"" NPT tap lying around so I re-threaded the fitting (the threads were squared off instead of sharp like they should be). Once the new fitting was in, I test fired it a few times and it works great. No more recovering dirt bike seats with a hand stapler, 16 oz. hammer and a pair of channel locks."
5,Perfect,"like it so far, Its a small little thing thats for sure. Does everything we have wanted it to do...."
3,No CO2,great gun but got it to use with my CO2 air system but guns says it can not use CO2. Should have said that on web site...
1,needs air pressure - not noted in description,i bought this - had no idea it needed an air pressure hose & tank! i dont have those and those items were not listed in the description. a bit of false advertising.
4,diy guy,perfect for putting up insulation. will try to use it for putting the fabric on a custom bench seat. good bump fire and few jams. wish it could hold more staples.
5,Screamin&#65533; rides cover to cover!,"Mountain biking is a real sport that requires real skills. Read previous nasty Amazon reviews for good measure but I slap this puppy with a firm five starts. Personally I'm more of an avid hiker but I thoroughly enjoy the change of pace. Trails from around the state are covered in various ranges of difficulty. Previous Amazon reviews complain about accuracy. I disagree. Sure I've missed a couple turns and nearly died in the process. Then looking back in the book it's mentioned. Things go pretty quick in mountain biking and it's easy to blow your pace. Keep in mind that even a ""rookie"" ride in mountain biking takes some skill. If you can control your speed, maneuver your bike and have the endurance to hike your bike when needed give it a go. This book isn't meant to teach you how to mountain bike. This is a trail guide and a darn good. The book is small enough to carry in your water backpack, so take it with you! - joe bartels / webmaster HikeArizona.COM"
5,Love the rides and humor.,I just dug out a copy of Fat Tire Tales and Trails that I purchased for our trip to Arizona about three years ago. Just want to say thanks. Love the rides and the humor. Made our trip in search of trails a lot easier and more fun.
5,Cosmic Ray is the MAN.,"I have relied heavily on Ray's book to plan my rides in Arizona over the past 5 years. Always right on with his descriptions, directions, and just a fun read altogether."
2,If you want to get lost....,"This book does give you a lot of great trails all over Arizona, but the maps are horribly inaccurate. The skill and effort ratings are way out of wack. The time estimation is so off you have to wonder whether the author rode a motorcycle on some of the trails and if he hiked the others. An example , in his description of one trail Cosmic Ray claims there are no big climbs however there are many huge climbs that switchback all over the place. It says it takes 3 hours to complete this trail, but when we rode this trail it took us over 4 just to get halfway and at halfway we couldn't find the trail and had to take pavement back. I would say buy this book just for a list of trails but get a supplement book to check the routes and the times or you will get stuck outside after dark."
2,Not so great,"I would definitely not recommend this book. The language to describe rides is totally ridiculous, most of the words are made-up, not just mountain bike lingo but straight out of thin (probably smokey) air. This makes it difficult to know what the trails are actually like. Also, the maps lack any topo information and the names of key sites such as trail heads along the trail are not included. The difficulties are inconsistent and often don't make sense. In combination with the made-up descriptions there is no way to tell what a trail that's skill level is rated as ""XXX Expert"" means. Directions to trailheads are also pretty much nonexistent, if you aren't from the area you will need another map to find your way around."
5,Cosmic Ray Rocks,"I am a Mountain Bike Journalist from the U.K. Thanks to Ray's guide I was able to arrive in Sedona for the first time and hit the trail rolling. Fat Tire Tales & Trails sends you to all the good stuff straight away with no messing about. The book has all the right info that a mountain biker cares to know. There is a ""favorite trail"" icon assigned to 5 or 6 rides in each area that is very helpful to those on a limited time schedule. The contour profile showing elevation change and distance helps you scope out a ride in just a glance. I dare say this is the best guide I've seen anywhere. Funny too."
3,"Good rides, BAD maps, bad categorization of rides","I attend college in Flagstaff, Arizona, and have embarked on about 10 of the 17 rides Cosmic Ray outlines in this book. The rides themselves are great; he can't screw up the scenery or trails. But the maps are horrible. Mileage is off on nearly every leg of the map. There are helpful landmarks and signs not listed in his book which should be included. He rates every ride for skill, using ""expert, not-so-tough,"" etc. but they are often misnomers. For example, one ride described as ""rookie, comfortable,"" and ""simple"" was a grueling, rough downhill on singletrack trail and jeep trail that is often muddy as heck, followed by a extremely steep hike and bike uphill with massive rocks in the trail. Not exactly something to take the family on, but he bills it as such. Buy the book for the good compendium of rides, but check the rides out first before you decide to bring friends or family. It may not be all that is described, or much much more."
5,YUM!,"I bought this book because I've been trying to avoid Chinese take-out! I love Chinese food, but take-out can be so greasy. By making my own, I can control the oil and sodium in each dish.An avid collector of Cooking Light books, I had to pick this up! More than 100 recipes; lots of fish, poultry, and beef selections; lots of variety. Got it yesterday; made the beef with spinach and ginger sauce for dinner that night. Got good reviews from my testers!Also, I was pleasantly surprised to see that the book covers more than Asian stir fry. Cuisines covered include Mexican and Italian, with fajitas and other quick cooking, high-heat dishes.Enjoy!"
5,Amazing collection of successful recipes,"So far we have tried 15 of the 150 recipes and they have all been good. We rate dishes on a 1 to 10 scale, and all in this cookbook have been 7 or higher. It is taking us a while to get through the recipes because we are repeating so many of the 8's and 9's! Also, all of the recipes include the calorie and carb counts, which is very helpful."
3,Too Simplistic,This book was too easy for my 5-year-old. She wanted more information than this book provided. It was better for my 2-year-old.
3,Stories of stories 2,"Accomplishing the ""twenty spine chilling tales"", an Australian-produced five-DVD set presents, according to producers, a cream de la cream of the Dahl's stories-tragic, deceptive, ambiguous events depicted by a strongly hilarious way.It is good for watching in-between something more educative and mind-broadening."
1,Steamboy,Too messy to deal with very often! Doesn't give that flow of steam that they show on TV -- disappointed.
1,Don't buy from RELIABLE....... Junk,They do not honor their warranty.Buy a steam shark from costco. Broke within 7 months and they would not offer to make it right.They wanted me to pay 30.00 to ship it to canada and then they would determine if it was broke. I know when it is not working (2nd steam mop) first mop lasted 7 years. I picked up the Steam Shark at Costco.I will open the Mop and try to fix it myself before I send it away just to be told that.......
3,Not an H20 mop.,This mop is hard on your hands. You have to squeeze the handle to make the steam come out. My hand starts cramping after only a few minutes of mopping. The H20 mop you squeeze it once and it stays on until you squeeze it again.
2,Reliable? Not really!,"Very disappointed with this product. You have to keep pressing down the switch button as you mop, very inconvenient and . Water tank is extremely hard to remove and replace. Cleaning result not impressive. Have to return the product back to Amazon. Return process was easy and refund was given right away. The Thane H2O Steam Mop is a better choice."
3,Pretty Good,"I bought this item for my Mom and she told me that Its was good but, It didn't have alot of steam coming out. It did pick up dirt quickly and It clean corners and It has two pads that came along with the purchase. It's a good steamboy but, not as strong like I thought it would be."
2,Realible T1 Steamboy mop,I was not too pleased with the product. It left the floor very wet. I hesitate to use it on a wood floor
4,Handy little guy beats cleaning the floor with mops and buckets,"I really like this product. However, make sure you follow the directions and vaccum before you use it. I thought I could skip it and ended up having to go back and vaccum up big, wet clumps of hair/dust/ick that had accumulated along the baseboards and in corners. The cord is kind of short which is mildly annoying because you have to switch outlets alot. It works in my house in Japan with the lower voltage which was a pleasant surprise. Also, the pad came out of the washer perfectly clean. I'm not sure this guy is massively better than a Swiffer wet mop, but it definitely does what its supposed to do. A battery pack would definitely make it five-star material."
1,Disappointing quality,"Received in July. It is now September. Product was used carefully and GENTLY approximately four times. Plastic on head has deteriorated and become hard, interior pieces as well as exterior pieces broken. Product not repairable or usable.Would NOT buy again."
2,Lasts less than one year,"I loved this steam mop, but it won't last more than a year. I bought a second one and it lasted less than a year. Also, the cord is really short so I have to do one room is two sections."
2,Better options out there,"The Steam Boy cleans well however, the product is heavy and hard to maneuver on tile floors. The fiber mop cover gets wet from steam and develops a suction like adhearance to the floor. The cord is too short (must use an extension)and the mop head is floppy. Directing it to a specific area (i.e., under cabinets, around toilets) is difficult. I bought this 2 years ago and there may have been some improvements since then. If not, another drawback is that the mop cannot be turned off without unplugging it. It will discolor your tile if you let it rest in an area while it is plugged in."
3,Steamboy T1 Floor Mop,"Since I have hard wood floors throughout, I needed a mop that was reliable and easy to handle. I found it in this product. It leaves my floors clean and shiny and the mop is easy to handle."
4,T1 Steamboy Floor Mop,This product is great! I have Metroflor (vinyl flooring) and have had a tough time getting it clean with traditional mopping. This steam mop got my floors extremely clean. I have a toddler and I no longer worry about him being all over the floor with the dirt and chemicals. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is that the cord is very short.
4,Great for Tile,My house is all tile. This steamer makes mopping a breeze. Dries quickly and get into the corners.
3,ok product,"Took a long time to recieve this product. THe first initial use, took over 45 minutes to heat up to a steam. Once heated up it cleaned great. However, when I needed to refil the water, it took a long time to once again heat up. It is very light weight and cleaned the best of anything I have tried."
2,Only ok. Not great.,"The television infomercial made this device look like it would work well on carpets. It helped mildly with the pet odor, but I had to go back over the carpet with a dry towel. The steam does last for a long time and this does tile & vinyl floors well. I use old towels clipped around the base after I have used the two covers that come with the product."
5,It's amazing!,I've used the steamboy for three weeks and LOVE IT! Cleans my floors quickly and perfectly. Floors dry in minutes. From start to finish - its takes me 5 minutes to wash my kitchen floor. Another 3 minutes to do the bathrooms. - great time saver. The pads wash in the washing machine (read the label - don't put them in dryer). No muss no fuss.
3,"Pads are poorly manufactured, but cleans well","The first day I opened this cleaner, I started cleaning the tile floor of one room of my home and the pad fell off. I put it back on and tightened the drawstring, and the drawstring broke. I got out the other pad and put that on, and it fell off. I put it back on and tightened the drawstring, and that one broke too! The pads are very cheaply made and the drawstrings break with a wimpy woman's touch, so beware. It cleaned my floors great for that 15 minutes before it broke, though. :)"
1,Steamboy Customer Service Very Poor,"I have had numerous problems with this steamboy. The plug has broken two times and my last problem involved an electrical fire where the cord attaches to the machine body. Apparently, as I was told by Steamboy, all the back and forth movement will cause the wire to become detached and this is why an electrical fire occurred. Because my machine is out of warrantly (one year) they will not replace the machine. Customer service is sorely lacking from this company. I will buy a product made by a different company as I now must replace this unit."
5,Wonderful Product!!,"I just got my Steamboy Steam Mop a few days ago. I had searched and read all the reviews for the past month. It was extremely easy to put together as well. I am very impressed with the performance. I have half wood laminate and half tile and it does a great job on both. I like the head on this mop better than the Bissell and Shark, because its small enough to go around toilets and narrow areas. I will say that you may want to purchase extra pads. They get very wet and dirty fast and you have to keep washing the 2 they come with.Other than that I love the product!"
3,Not suitable for laminate & certain hardwood flooring,"If you put steam on laminate flooring, be prepared to buy new planks. If you put steam on improperly-sealed or unsealed hardwood flooring, same outcome."
4,Works Great,Have been using this for I don't even know how many years and I love it. I love that I don't need to use chemicals and that it cleans pretty reliably.
2,Steam Mop,"This product does not perform like it states in the detailed description. It does not continue to steam for 30 minutes on its own, you have to hold the buttom. It also is heavy to push around. I purchased this for my mother to replace the Shark Steam Mop which was hard to push around and clogged, and this product is not much better."
4,only one flaw,I have parquet floors in my kitchen and foyer. It's really great to have a product that uses steam to clean. I was very happy with how the floor looked after finishing the mopping. It took quite a while for me to complete the job due to the fact that the cover would not stay on. I finally used three large safety pins to gather the cover at the corners and to keep it in place. Surely the manufacturer will come up with a better design.
4,This thing picks up some dirt!,"I purchased this product for my wife and she loves it. This mop picks up more dirt than any mop that I have ever seen. Just when you thought your floor was clean, mop it again with the steam mop and you will be amazed at the amount of dirt it picks up. I highly recommend this product to all that likes a clean place. I will say that this mop takes a little getting use to to become an expert steam mop user. If used wrong, it can leave your floor damp/wet."
1,Dissatisfied,"This product is difficult to put together and is very hard to push around to clean a floor. In order to make it easier to use you have to use a lot of water and it takes forever to dry. No instructions on how to use on a carpet even though there is a ""carpet attachment"". Would never use on a carpet because of the water needed. Very disappointed in this product."
1,reliable steamboy,reliable steam boy.leaks badly. Has parts that are not well described in instructions.would suggest that you pass it by.
4,Real time saver,I used my Steamboy for the first time yesterday and was very pleased with the results. I had done quite of bit of research before the purchase so think that I made a good decision. I have dark colored tile floors and most cleaning products leave a dull looking floor. With just the steam the floors are shiny and clean. I liked it so much I just purchased one for a gift for my son. I gave it four stars because of the short cord. I usually use an extension cord on my vacuum so it really doesn't bother me. But it might for some people. I found it easy to use and a real time saver.
4,Easy On The Trigger,"Before buying this item I read some comments about too much water released during use. I bought it anyway and after using it, it's great! I found that if you keep your finger on the trigger, all the time, it does release a lot of steam which stays on the floor as water. I used it again and didn't hold the trigger all the time and it still cleaned well without a lot of water left behind, although it still needed a few minutes to dry. Great tool that is easy to get used to."
1,The only reliable thing about Steamboy is it's name,This steam cleaner is worthless!Save your money for a more expensive model that really works. Gives off little puffs of steam. Works for 20 min tops then stops working. Sent it back to the manufacturer and they say it works just the way it is designed to. AND it only took 3 WEEKS for them to figure that out before returning it to me!!! Bottom line....Product is terrible as is the company that services it!
1,Awful Product,"The SteamBoy is a flop! Each time I've used it, puddles end up on the floor. I have to sop them up with paper towels. I am going to toss this product in the nearest dumpster I can find!"
1,Do not buy!,"This thing is terrible. Barely no steam, the mop head cover keeps coming off (no matter how much I tried to tighten it) and the cord is super short. I returned it the NEXT DAY!"
1,Don't be fooled,In theory this is a great idea however the pad that you use to put over the plastic head of the mop gets saturated almost immediately by the steam. You are then simply pushing a dirty wet cloth over the rest of the floor. After 5 or so careful uses of this mop it now leaks and is essentially worthless. Don't waste your money.
2,Too Much Work!,"I was all excited to get this, thinking how easy my life would be if I could just mop my kitchen floor any old time. However, it turns out this products is very heavy to push, and you can't really use a back and forth motion cuz the cover will fall off. It falls of very easily, actually. Very frustrating. I also don't think it does such a great job of cleaning -- give me my mop and Brite any day over this!"
1,Terrible and waste of money!,"This steam mop is useless! It leaks all over and leaves floors soaked. You cannot use it on hardwood because of how much water it makes. The steam comes out of just one jet so it does nothing. It does not even get the whole pad hot barely warm on the outside so there is no way it sanitizes anything. You might as well put hot water in a bucket and use a mop that is about how well this sanitizes. It is only hot in the middle where the jet is which is about 2"" area. This is just ridiculous. The jets need to be all over the area and more than one. So the stated temperature is not true it does not reach that. I measured steam temp not even close to stated temp. So other steam cleaners that are 212F are probably better at sanitizing if they have multiple jets spread around the whole surface of the head of the steamer."
1,Poor Quality,Swivel head collapsed and cracked apart after very light use. Quote of replacement parts and shipping from manufacturer costs half of new product. Quality isn't there.
2,"Great Concept, Failure of a Product","I really, really wanted to love this steam cleaner. I tried to overlook the annoying flaws like the fact that it falls over all the time, the water compartment leaks, and the cord doesn't hook onto itself. I wanted to proof my family wrong. They all said it looked like another stupid, gimmicky product, and they were right. The idea of steam cleaning is great, but this product is a huge letdown. It leaves far too much water behind and you still have to get down on your hands and knees to scrub any time you have anything substantial on the floor. I am fairly tall and the steam cleaner hurts my back after just mopping our small kitchen. I find I have to lift the product up and drag it towards me in order to not leave a trail of dirt. And all the hoopla about getting into corners and tight spaces, well forget it. Get your sponge out, there isn't any real improvement there over a mop. In the end the quantity of flaws make me wish I had saved the money."
4,Great mop,"I think this is a great mop and really like the fact that it cleans with steam and not chemicals. The only complaint I have is that the cord is not as long as I would like for it to be and at times, I have trouble getting the pads to stay on as tightly as I would like. Overall, it is a wonderful product and I would highly recommend it."
1,As seen in my living room...,"This mop will leave a wet mess.Unless you're looking for a wet mop (sure you can find one less expensive than this), don't waste your time and money on this product.I received this as a wedding gift from bed bath and beyond...(by the way, it took almost a month to receive), I'm going to return it for store credit..."
3,Price Jump???,"I haven't used mine yet, but I ordered it here Jan 15th, 2007 at $79. It wasn't on special either. Now they are selling it for $299?????? This is the SAME one I bought too. You might want to check around for a better price?"
1,Disappointed,"Upon using the steam mop a few times, it began to leak. Tried everything to no avail so I emailed Reliable to which I could not get them to respond. So my steam mop still does not work well and there is no way to fix it. Waste of $100.00."
2,Disapointing,"I bought this to steam clean my new hardwood floors. It heats up fast, but the floor quickly becomes a wet mess. It cleans no better than a regular mop, yet leaves floors very wet. As a second, chance, I let me cleaning lady use it while I was gone and asked her to give me an honest review. She said ""Return it. It leaves the floor way too wet."" Sent it back to Amazon, awaiting my refund."
2,T1 Steamboy floor mop,"I love the idea of this product. I have used to once, and was not happy with it's performance, I found is messy to use. And plan on returning it."
1,"A very, very bad movie","This has to be one of the all-time worst movies ever made. I mean, come on! Lou Diamond Philips and Jennifer Tilly as Inuits? The whole movie is a shameless distortion of Inuit life and culture, the type of portrayal one would have expected from a movie made in the 1930s. Worst of all, though, is the fact that Toshiro Mifune somehow felt compelled to become involved with this movie. Why, man? Why? You were such a grea actor and certainly didn't need something like this to besmirch your great reputation."
3,Great but not the Pygmies,"This is an amazing album however to me it isn't The Velcro Pygmies. The record is well produced, has plenty of hooks to sink your teeth into, and well crafted songwriting, but it made me think Black Crowes instead of ""Larger Than Life Rock."" If I wasn't such an avid Pygmie fan (been seeing them since I started college in 1999) I would love this record, but after experiencing the Pygmies live this album doesn't capture them. The packaging is 100% top flight and the DVD kicks major butt. It's everything I hoped for except it wasn't over the top like the Pygmies really are. My advice to anyone that is considering purchasing this CD: After listening to it, go and see the band live. Then you will truly understand where this review is coming from. The Pygmies are the last great hope. They have the ability to save rock n roll."
1,Garbage,I found this at a garage sale in a flea market. It is absolute garbage. Stick to playing covers at Casinos and Frat Bars and leave the real rock to talented artists!
5,Fly Away Home,"I purchased the DVD of """"Fly Away Home."" It arrived well before I expected it. The DVD quality was fine. I enjoyed the story. It was what I expected. And now I am passing it on for friends to enjoy. I would buy from this seller again."
5,A beautiful movie,"This one is to be shared by kids and grown-ups alike. One thing: if buying in VHS format, get the English-language version, not the Spanish-dubbed one. If you hear both soundtracks, the reason will become obvious."
5,Fly Away Home - a true story,"My young grand daughter asked my husband and I to watch this video. We went to the video store; looked all over for it, and found it in the children's section. After a short pause, we went ahead and rented it and we were both so glad we did. Since we saw it, we have been looking for it in the stores, and just found and ordered it here. We just received it and watched it again, and it is one of the most touching and memorable stories we've ever watched. Both of us enjoyed the entire movie, from beginning to end, and now can watch it as many times as we want, which I'm sure will be often. The story is so touching and cute, with a lot of strength, unselfishnes, and love shown on the part of the young girl. It's so cute, you just want to watch it again, and it becomes a topic of conversation when good video's are brought up among friends and family. I highly recommend this movie to children and adults alike and am so grateful to my grand daughter for pushing us to see it."
4,"Very good, but marred by a few ""wrong messages""","This film tells of a wonderful story, and it is beautifully filmed. I enjoyed it very much, but wished that a brief scene or two had been reconsidered by the director. In particular, I did not like it when the game warden was about to clip a wing of a gosling, and the daughter just goes ""ballistic,"" bonking him on the head with a pot or some such object, then screaming bloody murder. How does her father respond? He roughs the guy up ,then throws him out of the house. Later in the film, we are given a scene that intentionally paints the U.S. airforce as ""over-reacting"" to the imagined ""threat"" of the father and daughter flying the geese home. Seems the father over-reacted, too. Hope parents take the time to tell their kids that, no matter how ""in the right"" you may feel about something, you don't get violent to make your points."
2,Five Star Movie; Two Star DVD Release,"No argument here as to the fine movie that ""Fly Away Home"" is, but a HUGE disappointment in Columbia/TriStar's decision to release it in the full screen aspect ratio only. It kept me from buying the Laserdisc, and will so keep me from buying the DVD. It's a pity that such a beautifully cinematic movie is not offered in the original theatric ratio for full viewing pleasure. Sour grapes? I don't think so. One of DVD's intrinsic values is the ability to deliver movies in BOTH formats for viewer choice. Columbia/TriStar apparently believes that it's their decision to make, but my consumer vote says ""I don't think so!"""
3,OK,"I had to watch this so many times b4 and it got kinda boring, but it was ok the 1st time, It seemed kinda long though. Its about a young girl who raises some ducklings and her journey to fly them away when they are grown."
1,Horrible experience....will not play on any DVD player.,Love the movie and wanted to share with friends. DVD will not play on any type of DVD player. A different error code on each player. Will not buy from this dealer again.
4,Fly Me to the Moon,"Poet Seamus Heaney once wrote about the ""Death of a Naturalist,"" but in Fly Away Home the spirit of the hippy-dippy tree-hugger is resurrected. And that's a good thing!An achingly beautiful ode to flight (metaphorical and literal) and family, the story is simple enough. Amy Alden (Anna Paquin) loses her mom in a car crash on a rain-slick New Zealand road. Estranged dad Thomas (Jeff Daniels) drags the kid back to Canada where his sculptures and off-kilter experiments with flying don't exactly endear Amy to her pop. It's not until she rescues a gaggle of goose eggs, raises the chicks, and becomes their humanoid mommy that the pair of lost souls can find a way to reconnect and lead the geese south for the winter.Once you get a load of Caleb Deschanel's phenomenal cinematography the visual poem will be complete. For Fly Away Home sends a graceful air-gram through the skies with the greatest of ease."
5,The movie Fly Away Home,"My 3-year-old Grandson saw this movie on a movie channel on tv and was mesmerized. He cried when it went off and kept saying he wanted to watch it again. I couldn't find it locally so I ordered it from Amazon, and, as always, got quick service and I had the movie in his hands in a few days. Now he can watch it whenever and as often as he likes! Thanks, Amazon!"
5,One of my best 100 movies of all time,"Honest, simple and marvellous directing. All acting even geeses ;-) are very down to earth, cinematography is marvellous, every shot and music is wonderful. Also, it is a movie with great moral about what really matters at the end.I am a movie fan and not the easy one, believe me this movie is one of my 100 best movies all the time with others such as Sling Blade, Leolo, Space Odysee 2001, Blade Runner, Shawshank Redemption, Innocence, African Queen, Amarcord ........"
3,why not widescreen?,"I have seen this film many times and will watch it many more. A very well acted, and beautifully shot movie with great music and yet, I bought the laser disc version. I'm sorry but this DVD needs to be released in a widescreen format to get the full effect of this wonderful movie."
4,Must see movie!!,"I love owning the DVD of this movie! I taped it from a TV showing and it was adequate, but the quality of the DVD is excellent and the added features give the viewing pleasure an added dimension. I highly recommend this movie."
4,english only,I was not aware that this dvd had a sub title was in a foreign language. this is not what I wanted. For future orders be sure to make this clear.
1,A Stupid Movie!,This is such a .... and sad movie. One time our class was meant to go on a St. Pat's Walk but we couldn't because it was raining outside. So our teacher rented this from Blockbuster. I felt like running out of the classroom. This is a sad movie with sad songs and I'm NEVER going to watch this movie AGAIN! I would've liked to rate this movie no stars but I had to rate this movie so I rated it 1 star.
4,fly away home,it was good to me but i won't sure it with know body else about the movie. it was okay.
4,love this movie,"This is a great, heartwarming story - great for kids who are too old for most animated movie but too young for PG 13. The whole family will enjoy this movie!"
5,Fly away home,I liked the movie and bought it for my grandson who just loves the story. It was a great birthday present
5,A personal project,"The quality of this movie -- cast, director, writers -- reflects the quality of producer John Veitch. Mr. Veitch, though his credits list is short, was actually one of the behind-the-scenes movers and shakers of Hollywood, as a studio executive with Columbia Pictures. He was also, by marriage, part of the Ladd clan. 1961'sMisty, starring David Ladd, was the story a wild herd of ""ponies"" in their annual human-led ""migration"" between Assateague and Chincoteague Islands near the Virginia-Maryland border. Sound familiar? There's Igor the goose and Misty the pony, and the goal of the goose migration was North Carolina. Can there be any doubt that Bill Lishman's story evoked a feeling of dejà vu for John Veitch? This was Veitch's last movie and a tribute to a talented, kind and beloved man."
5,Fly Away Home,This is one of my grandson's favorite movies. He loves the geese but I think he gets the biggest kick out of a young girl getting to fly an ultralight by herself over such a distance. I love the music and always wipe a tear at the end.
4,Quality,"TGU sometimes get classified as Asian Underground, but they're really much more Arabic flavored. The groove here is more of a reggae thing than the club rhythms favored by the Asian Underground. If this sounds appealing, you'll like this album, because TGU pull it off very well. All the stuff with Egyptian singer Natacha Atlas is first rate. A few of the other tracks are a little weak, particularly the ""raps"", but the highlights merit 4 stars."
4,NOT GLOBAL UNDERGROUND!,"TRANSGLOBAL UNDERGROUND NOT TO MIX UO W/ THE TRANCE-DJ-COMPILATION GLOBAL UNDERGROUND (SASHA & JOHN DIGWEED). I REALLY LIKE THIS ALBUM OF THEIRS 'COZ I LIKE ETHNICAL-INFLUENCED ELECTRONIC MUSIC. THIS ONE HAS A LOT OF EASTERN-ORIENTAL ELEMENTS, ESPECIALLY THE SONGS WITH NATASHA ATLAS SINGING. IF YOU LIKE ALBUMS LIKE THIS ONE, YOU SHOULD ALSO CHECK OUT LOOP GURU, BADMARSH AND SHRI AND TALVIN SINGH."
1,Not for me,"Not my type of music to start with. Bought 2 copies but threw them away. Production was good, but did not like the playlist."
5,Need some screaming intensity? Or trippy effects?,"If you've ever tried one of these, then you really don't need to hear what I have to say, but just in case...This pedal rocks! The tracking is great, and if you're 'that type' (the twisted type) playing two or more notes will cause it to break up in a very cool way. The footswitch adds another dimension to the pedal-- like a breaker or kill switch, so you can use the effect rhythmically!!Like most people, I don't use the harmonizer all that often, but you gotta admit, playing lines in harmonized major 3rds is pretty cool.If you're looking to add some new weaponry to your sonic arsenal, get this. I use mine in all kinds of music-- funk, rock, blues, avant-jazz... it's one of the handful of pedals that is always in my pedal chain."
3,DigiTech Whammy Pedal,"- Well made - should hold up to abuse.- Interesting sounds that kept my interest.....at least for a while....not sure how much I will be using this as the sound is pretty distinctive. Wouldn't want to use it all the time because it would get ""old.""- Kind of expensive for a pedal that I won't be using very much.Overall it is an interesting pedal that makes interesting sounds, even though you might not use it that much. I would recommend if you have some extra cash and are looking for something to add that little bit of ""color"" to your guitar playing."
4,A good book on marketing if you are in US,"Marketing requires learning and practicing. It is not only a business, but also a social as well as cultural subject. A lot of cultural issues are involved in practising marketing. As a book, this gives you a firm foundation on concepts. It is wonderful - provided you are able to understand examples mentioned. For we in India, most of the examples are alien. Also recent developments in online marketing ( like that of Amazon) find no mention. Interestingly these type of internet based examples can be experienced globaly. It is a good book to build your marketing foundations. Asian, European students, however will have to learn a lot outside the book. I hope that future editions of this book take in to account the differences in social and cultural settings across the globe. This limitation reduces the value of this book to those students. That is why my rating is 4 star"
1,Don't get caught up in the hype,This is a great example of how educational publishers are overcharging because of a captive audiance. For the price of this book I can purchase 3 business marketing books that all cover the same topics AND get 3 different opinions.Take some time to look at alternitives before spending this kind of money. Many great books are out there for a fraction of the cost.
4,most student friendly book available,it is a pleasure to read this book.it is a must for every management student like me.language is easy supported with good examples on every topic.
5,mercadotecnia,"necesito informacion acerca de la planeacion, control, ejecucion y analisis de la mercadotecnia"
3,DVD player didn't fit,"We recently order this for our portable audiovox DVD player. Our player has an 8 inch screen. I guess we should have measured it and our car seats. The DVD player is too small for the case, so we can't use it for that reason. And the other reason is that it is too big to fit in the position between our seats. It seems to be of good quality but we can't use it because of the reason above. So yes, measure everything before you buy it."
1,"Worked Great at First, Then Nothing","I was pleasantly surprised at how well this card worked when I first got it. Like the details say, it is 'plug and play', plugged it in and it found my DV camera right away. However, after only 2-3 uses, it now no longer connects to anything I plug into it. Bought this for live streaming at church, but it was a short-lived option, compared to buying an entire computer that comes with Firewire ports."
3,Astro Boy's a cute 'lil guide...,"Anime fans doing animation courses can get it a little tough here in the UK. The style just isn't popular enough and as much as I admire walt disney, it's a shame he stereotyped the genre as a kids-only zone. Interesting I should say that, as Tezuka is often hailed as the Japanese walk Disney (up there with such greats as Mamoru Osamu and Hayao Miyazaki.)Even for non anime fans, the walk cycles remain basically the same and this was a simple and understandable guide that gave you all the basics nessecary for various cycles, whether you use anime as a style or not. I mean, heck, I just made an entire SKIP CYCLE! SKIPPING!Not a great deal of information, but ideal for anyone just starting out with basic walk cycles and animation terchniques. Not a bad job, though it could've had a little more info. The book is probably better suited for younger people with an interest in the genre but hey, this nineteen year old ain't complaining."
4,One of the best and cheapest animation books.,"Some people have given this book less than positive reviews, well i think this is a great book that has some real information in it(unlike some drawing and animation books). This book gives a general prep, and tips on animation. It also pays special attention to walkcycles which is very usefull."
3,"Pretty good book, in spite of inaccuracies","I like Loren Estleman, don't get me wrong. He puts things together really well, writes good dialogue, good characters, and a pretty good story. But he really needed in his early books to concentrate more on his facts. I guarantee you this book deserves more than the one star Todd N gave it. But I can't honestly give it any higher than a three. I'm an avid reader of Kirby Jonas westerns because of the fact that he stays so historically accurate with EVERYTHING. I have to say he's the new king of the western novel. But Loren Estleman certainly has his place. If you can pass up a few errors in your history, natural history, and firearms, and a few outstanding contradictions that come from writing too fast, try Estleman out. But make sure to pick up one of those Kirby Jonas books if you want to know the REAL west!"
5,Awesome Book! Must Read!,This book was a recomendation by a close friend of mine. The book takes you to places that you'd never think an author would take you (for that time period). The romance between these two charaters is one of unforeseen passion. The book will make you want to stay up at all odd hours just to find out what is on the other page. There are so many parts of the book that I read over and over.
2,Fortune's Rocks is very rocky,"This book is so contrived, so awkward and fabricated, I felt as if I were being tugged along by an undertow. Puh-leez. A respected doctor willing to be swept away by a bit of jiggling silk-swathed flesh.. and risk everything.. career, family, respect.. and, of course, what is done sticks.. and there is a child.. and yearning despair.. and difficulties galore.. or so you were supposed to think, which I never could. I could not get into the time or place or spirit of this novel. The main character never semed to gel, and as for the doctor, well, he seemed less weighty than a grain of beach sand (where so much of said jiggling occurs - the main character likes to remove her stockings and run about the beach dampening her garmentry and losing hairpins.) So much of this novel seemed pared to fit into a ninety-minute Movie of the Month plot, details chopped up and glossed over. Which perhaps Shreve had in mind when she word-processed this untidy tiresome tome."
1,disappointing,"After reading Weight of Water, I was looking forward to reading Anita Shreve's latest- and was greatly disappointed. I couldn't turn up one character in this book that I like-- a spoiled,oversexed teenager, a wealthy,middle-aged,married doctor with an eye for young girls-these are the heroes? Between their trysts, they find the time to look down their noses at the poor with a mixture of sympathy & disgust-is this supposed to endear them to the reader? It didn't work on this one."
1,dreary,I had long ago passed on Shreve's books. I realized that she had inserted parts of one of her books within another of her stories. Happened on a paper back in my library of her first book Eden Close. Found it mildly entertaining. Decided to try her again with Fortune's Rocks. Back to my original descision. Boring!!!
4,Another good story from Anita Shreve,"I was fascinated by The Weight of Water, a previous novel written by Anita Shreve long before she became an Oprah author. I also had the pleasure of attending a book talk at our local library that spotlighted Anita Shreve. She represents her craft very well. In Fortune's Rocks she vividly portrays her characters, their settings and the era in which they lived. It was easy to understand her characters in the light of the era in which they lived. One was reminded of the story of King Solomon who had to make a decision about the fate of a young child. All of the books by Anita Shreve are vastly different, but all are entertaining to the reader."
2,A very disappointed reader of Anita Shreve's books,"I had to plod my way through this romanticized version of an 18th century English novel. Unfortunately Anita Shreve fails to achieve any resemblance of a well crafted plot. I found the novel slow,the pace crawls and the material childish. I have enjoyed Shreve's other books and am surprised at her latest one. Fortune's Rocks should have remained in New Hampshire by the sea."
3,A Good Beach read,"Found the story a little preposterous, but managed to finish it. I think it highly unlikely that a girl from a good family could have carried on an affair like this without being discovered, but stranger things have probably happened. Shreve can't seem to make her characters come alive for me for some reason--""The Pilot's Wife"" was the same--both stories had great potential but were a little flat."
2,A waste of time,The story was predictible...the writing so so. I expected more from Ms. Shreve. Stick with Anne Lamott or Kaye Gibbons.
5,"A Great, Great Read","This is one of the best books I've read. I'm a big fan of Anita Shreve, and she certainly didn't let me down with this one. I especially enjoyed the writing/language style, which I believe is reminescent of what early 20th century writing is like. The characters (especially Olympia and Haskell) are well developed, and I felt as though I knew them. Although the plot was a little fundamental, it grabbed me and held my interest throughout. I tend to judge a book by how much I think about the characters and the plot when I'm not reading it, and ""Fortune's Rocks"" pulled me away from necessary chores on several occasions."
3,Could have been better,"This book was just okay. It was fine while I was reading it, but I'd classify it as forgettable. It's nothing spectacular, though it would make fine reading when you don't have anything better at hand. It's a bit better though than Danielle Steel's novels with their interchangeable characters and settings.I do not wish to lambast any writer here, as I have great respect for both Ms. Steel and Ms. Shreve. I only hope to write reviews that give people similar to me in their choice of reading material an idea of what lies ahead before they pick up their next book.FORTUNE'S ROCKS is worth checking out if you are either a Shreve fan or a voracious reader who consumes most every bit of fiction."
5,sacrifice for love,"Wonderful love story set in Victorian New England. The main character will captivate you with her strength and determination.I Read this book in two nights, couldn't put it down!Wonderful book to curl up with on a snowy weekend! This work proves that true love has no boundries. A must read!"
5,Wonderful love story,"The book began slowly, and I didn't think I wanted to deal with the language, but I am so glad that I hung in there. I have had a similiar love story like this in my life. I just hope mine ends the same way as Olympia's!"
3,Good til the end,This book was most enjoyable until the last 10 pages. Everything came together too pat. I would have preferred a more somber ending.
1,no interest,"After enjoying Sea Glass and The Pilot's Wife, this was a great let-down. In particular, the language annoyed me from page 1. I don't mind if the quoted, spoken text aimed to reproduce a style from c.1899, but really hated when the rest of the text (the author's words) also did so... I will be much more careful of this author in future."
2,Fortunes Rocks,"I bought Fortunes Rocks because I found The Pilot's Wife riveting. As much as I liked the previous book, however, I found this one to be disappointing. Normally I enjoy visiting bygone eras in fiction, but I found the premise of the novel implausible and the story itself, boring. The end was insultingly tidy -- (don't read further without ""spoiling"" the end). The family is healed and reunited at their beloved summer home; and the boy, his working class parents (thankfully dead and dying), is back among the fold just in time to avoid a life sentence in a factory and to benefit from the manners, couth and education his biological parents can offer."
1,Melodramatic rubbish,"I made it about 1/4 way through before giving up. Not at all what I expected after The Pilot's Wife. This is sheer, unmitigated drivel."
3,"Not Bad, but Painful","This book was pretty well written...it kind of dragged in a few places, but overall the book gets the points across. Being in a similar situation myself, I can say that from experience that it does get across the pain of being in love with someone while everyone you know shuns you for it."
2,Disappointing,"I found this book very disappointing. The content was questionable (15 yr old with a ""man"" 3 times her age), and the general tone of the book did not have much of a flow to it."
2,Sadly disappointing,"I am a dedicated reader and fan of Anita Shreve and have loved all of her other works. However, this book was disappointing from the first page. I could not relate to any of the characters...I never felt any connection to them at all. The fact that a 41 year old man could fall in love with a 15 year old at first sight is beyond my comprehension, even in the present day, let alone a century ago. The prose is overly dramatic and there were passages that did not keep my attention at all. I hope her next novel improves upon this one..."
2,The same old story,"In Fortune's Rocks, Shreve presents us with your basic young-girl-falls-in-love-with-married-older-man-and-gets-pregnant scenario. Shreve continues however, to create a story after the initial romance involving our heroine, Olympia, and her struggle to find the child she gave birth to.Unfortunately, Olympia, (who is portrayed as independent but helpless, self-assured but needy) is generally unlikable. While I hesitate to say she got what she deserved, I do not find much sympathy for her or her lover who had the courage to ruin the lives of both of their families but not the courage to find each other again - in the face of it all - to be together.While Shreve is skilled at creating a sense of place, and the beach community of Fortune's Rocks is enviable, her characterizations in this novel do not ring true and lack depth, insight or interest."
2,Borrow it from the library before purchasing!,"Anita Shreve is one of my favorite authors, but she struck out with Fortune's Rocks. If you want to read her at her best try Resistance, Weight of Water, or The Pilot's Wife. The style she adopts for this book is cloying and the characters so shallow and uninteresting it's difficult to care what happens to them. This is a very disappointing addition to her otherwise five-star body of work."
1,"Don't be fooled by ""morality tale""","Anita Shreve is pushing an agenda, but not necessarily a moral one. Yes, Fortune Rocks contains many truthes...teenaged mothers shouldn't be ostracized from society, and are still people worthy of love, but ultimately the book tries to make adultery acceptable. This book depressed me. Not only because Shreve never admits that most of the suffering could've been averted by different (and wiser) choices, but because her amoral thinking is cleverly couched between truthes and half-truthes. I also hate reading books that make hot, infatuation sex the highest possible endeavor in life, and that all else (especially a good marriage and children) should be sacrificed for it."
1,Couldn't stand it.,"The only reason I finished this book was for a reading group. Blech. The whole premise is the affair between a 15 year old girl and a 41 year old married man. She is selfish, and he lacks self-control, reminding me of a perpetrator at times. I could not stand this book all the way through, found the author's style of writing too flowery, and the book was just really distasteful. Of course, it all works out to a happy, if unrealistic, ending. I feel insulted after reading this- it's like a Jerry Springer show!"
2,Sort of readable but forgettable,"This novel is trying to be an exploration of passion but comes off as bloodless and wooden. Fifteen-year-old fallen woman Olympia Biddeford, the main character, never comes to life, and the author's attempts to convince us her relationship with a man three times her age is a deep spiritual love is ludicrous. The book is by the numbers, and the attempt at 19th-century speak is irritating. Did not people ever use contractions in their speech back then? I cannot believe they did not, but I shall not argue with the author further."
4,Annoying but compelling,This is my first Anita Shreve book. I decided to give it a go because I needed something easy to read but reasonably intelligent.I found the book in some parts extremely annoying. For no other reason but for the subject matter. It was still very compelling to continue reading.What I liked was it was not too cliche' as a love story. I am not into love stories at all. This book I feel could be classed as controversial by today's standards but still well written enough not to cross any immoral boundaries.It is a good read and very much recommended. I would think though it is a book for females.
5,Absolute Magic!!,"I've read everything by Anita Shrieve-some better than others, but this is her best novel by far. I truly loved it. You won't be able to put it down. Her writing is magical. It is so descriptive and observant, that there were moments I was completely lost in the book."
4,"Starts slow, but a great read...","I was worried while reading the first half of this book. I knew I would finish it, but I wasn't sure I would enjoy it. I'm happy to report that I enjoyed it very much. I love the way this book was written...easy to follow, but intelligently told. By the second half of the book, things get interesting and you get wrapped up in the main character - Olympia. I have also read Pilot's Wife and Sea Glass by Anita Shreve, but Fortune's Rocks was my favorite of the three. I've become quite a fan of Anita Shreve's and plan to read many more of her novels. I highly recommend this book, especially if you like beautifully written books with a heavy subject matter."
4,A BOOKSHELF KEEPER,"One of Anita Shreve's best, though I wish the book had ended a bit sooner. The difficult subject of underage passion with an older, married man is treated with delicacy and beauty. This novel was hard to put down. I'd also recommend ""A Pilot's Wife"" by the same author."
2,Fortune's Rocks = Romance Novel,"""Fortune's Rocks"" should be classified as a Romance novel, meaning, if you like the kind of book that shows and woman in a rapturous embrace on the cover, you'll probably like this. If you think that Anita Shreve does a good job portraying ""real people"" you need to expand your reading list. The prose was overly elaborate (for example, Olympia said ""Was it not?"" at the end of 90% of her sentences)and dripping with ridiculous metaphors and sentimental heartstring tugs. ""It was not"" worthy of a writer I've heard much about."
1,Too Close for Comfort,"Please! I was born in Biddeford, Maine, and spent many happy summer days at a local beach called Fortunes Rocks. As I read this book, I kept bumping up against those two names and having a tough perceptual time of it. I read somewhere that part of Shreve's research involved touring the southern Maine coast, where she must asssuredly have gotten her inspiration. Sorry, but it just didn't do it for me. The whole thing came off sounding too cartoonish and not at all believable."
2,Had a Hard Time with Child Abuse Disguised as Love!,"I had a hard time reading this and feeling empathy for a 41 year old married man and a 15 year old girl. Granted, times were different in 1900 than they are today, but really! Ms. Shreve's writing is excellent. Her imagery is great. But why have a 41 year old man having sex with a 15 year old? How can most people relate to that and feel empathy for these characters?"
1,Don't bother,"I couldn't get very far in this book, way too many words. Just get to the point! Gave it to my sister and she got much further. But after a few hundred pages she decided she didn't like the characters or the theme and gave up."
4,Good read,"This one has plenty of turns and twists and an unexpected ending. Loved how Shreve puts this all together, making the characters seem like they were real."
4,TIMELESS DILEMMA,"WELL WRITTEN STORY OF THE TIMELESS DILEMMA OF A SEEMINGLY ILL FATED LOVE. IN SOME WAYS SIMILAR TO THOMAS HARDY, JOHN FOWLES, AND EVEN GIGI AND GASTON...INDEED ONE WONDERS WHAT GASTON WOULD HAVE DONE WERE HE ALREADY MARRIED! SHREVE WEAVES A POWERFUL STORY. THE INEVITABILITY OF THE TRAGEDY IS BEAUTIFULLY DRAWN OUT. THE ABSENCE OF DEPTH TO HASKELL'S CHARACTER MAKES ONE WONDER IF ANY ENLIGHTENED AND PROGRESSIVE MAN WOULD DO FOR A GIRL/WOMAN LIKE OLYMPIA. THE PERSPECTIVE IS TRULY FEMININE."
2,This Book Does Not Achieve it's Intended Result,"The purpose of the novel was to portray the main character as a stunning, dynamic heroine who overcomes much. I am not at all sorry to divulge the truth: the protagonist is a self-pitying martyr who throws away her one chance for true happiness. That a Victorian girl, raised among the upper classes, would make such initial mistakes as she did is hard to believe. Unless you're a masochist, don't bother even borrowing this from the library. Read Shreve's earlier, ""Strange Fits of Passion"", instead; it's a GOOD book."
2,Just another Romance,"Books come and go, some spark that special something inside of you, ""Fortune's Rocks"" isn't one of those books. Sure it has hope and passion, and it's plot can be captivating, but in the end, it's just another romance novel, nothing more than a souped up dime store novel. Anita Shreve only copied the basic plot... boy and girl meet, fall in love, tragedy strikes, a struggle begins, then they manage to re-conquer their lost feelings. Try again, this time come up with an original idea"
2,Boring,Fortune' Rocks Anita ShreveI thought it was boring. Wish I had not wasted my valuable time on it. It almost became one of our Book Club choices.
3,Like The Tide..,"This book is like a tide,a bad and obvious metaphor,I know,but thats about the only way I can describe it. The trial part was engrossing;and the ending a surprize. Now,the low tide,I can't believe a mature established man would mess around with ""jailbait"" like Olympia,whose character both interested and at times annoyed me. And why do they always have to be so beautiful? Why not an average-attractive girl for a change? Not hideous,but maybe an awkward 15 year old,which is what most of them are anyway. Then maybe that would make Olympia's obsession with Dr. Haskell more believable and poigant,and add more depth to the story as a whole. A good book that could've been great..!"
4,Visually charming but ultimately a letdown.,"I enjoyed this book almost until the final few chapters. Although I enjoy ""happy endings,"" this one wraps up a little too cute - and it didn't ring true for the characters that had been developed up to that point. Shreve makes the New Hampshire coast sound amazing and the character detail is excellent - I had no trouble picturing every place and person. My only complaint was the final third of the book did not jive with the first part. The ending was hollow and unenjoyable because of this."
5,I can't say enough good things about this book!,"I read Ms. Shreve's last book, THE PILOT'S WIFE, and liked it very much. But this one has just blown me away. I've enjoyed it so much that when I reached the end, I just started all over again. I haven't read a book that has given me so much food for thought in ages. Thanks Ms. Shreve. Keep 'em coming!"
1,Is Anita Shreve having a joke at our expense?,"I admire Ms. Shreve's talent and enjoyed all of her books until I read ""Fortune's Rock"" or I should say started to read ""Fortune's Rock."" I finally abandoned it because I could not find a single character who was not totally self absorbed. The idea of a spoiled 15 year old child seducing a middle aged, married friend of her father is nearly as disgusting as the idea of the lecher consumating sex with the child.I hope this is a departure for Ms. Shreve and that she will return to the mature and sensitive themes she has explored in the past."
2,disappointing,"This is my first Anita Shreve novel and I'm not impressed. The story is intriguing, but the dialogue and logic of the main character, Olympia, makes my eyes roll. It's as if Shreve set the story at the turn of the 20th century but gave the heroine 21st century values. It's just so unbelievable when you consider when this is supposed to take place--but yet, I can't turn away! Quite fluffy and a few steps above a Harlequin romance."
3,"An entertaining read, but lacks insight","Borrowed from a friend, I read this book overnight. It makes captivating reading, however, it does lack insight into the behaviour of its characters. Whether this is deliberate to stir contraversy, or the author truly believes that a 15 year old girl and a 40+ man are capable of developing mature love, I do not know. Ms. Shreve has another novel hidden in the pages of this book, and I do suggest that she should write it if she finds the time: The story of Dr. Haskell's wife and the four children he abondones as a results of the consummation his mid-life lust crisis with Olympia's teenage infatuation. Perhaps their turmoil and feelings would make compelling reading, too."
3,Good story but lacking in passion,"I enjoy historical fiction so when I read the back of this book I thought I'd try it. For the most part the novel had an enjoyable story line but it lacked any passion. This is a problem because the premise of the story is a passionate affair.The only way the reader knows that Olympia and Haskell have feelings for each other is the narrator tells them. It almost comes as a shock when the Haskell and Olympia wind up in bed together after only a few encounters. This lack of passion stems from the reader not really getting a glimpse at either main charcters thoughts.The enjoyable part of this novel comes fromt the actual story. The descriptions of place and time. The reader gets a real sense of life at the turn of the century and peoples roles in day to day life. I also enjoyed the ending, it was not what I expected but I really enjoyed it."
3,Why such a love affair?,"As I began to read Fortunes Rock, I was entranced by the very descriptive writing. I felt that I was almost physically there in the place where the story unfolds. But as I continued to read the story, I felt an uneasiness with what I sensed would be the main thrust of the story, a love affair between a 15 year-old young lady (not a woman in any stretch of the imagination) with a man some 40 plus years old. I am not a prude by any means, but as I continued reading, reaching the pages about their first kiss, I felt a surge of anger that a writer as fine and gifted as Ms. Shreve (I thoroughly enjoyed The Pilot's Wife) should have thought that this story should be written and read. What a pity that Ms. Shreve did not use her talents for better purposes."
1,I don't understand what the fuss is about,"I'm about 1/3 of the way through this book only because it is a holiday weekend and the library is closed. The prose is very well done but there is no content. The story line thus far has been: middle aged, married man views 15 year old girl on beach, falls in love, has minimal polite interaction with her, has sex with her. It is painfully slowmoving and unrealistic. The only part that caught my attentiion was the guy's interest in improving working conditions in the mills (a subject that was quickly dropped after a quick mention). Wish I could say better but tonight I'll be watching TV!"
4,Lighten Up!,"Please, all of you puritanical narrow minded reviewers out there, remember - its only a book. I found this latest Anita Shreve novel to be as enchanting and transporting as all of the rest of her books. For anyone who would like a beautiful ""comfort read"" for this time of year (dead of winter), this is you pick."
5,My Favorite Shreve Book,"As an avid reader of Anita Shreve (in fact, I have read every book she has published), I can honestly say that this is my favorite Shreve book. In fact, when asked, I tell people that this is my favorite book I have ever read. Like all Shreve books, no subject is off-limits. Her books present moral dilemmas that are controversial, but her books also push her readers to think, really think, about life. Fortune's Rocks is a love story between two unlikely characters, and this romance itself is the dilemma. The book left me speechless and holding my breath until the end. And like all Shreve books, the moral to the story is simply this: actions can, in fact, have irrevocable consequences. The book is very honest, and gives a haunting look at a point in history that we must never forget."
3,"Not great, but not that bad either","I think I'm one of the ones in the minority here. I had a difficult time getting into the book at first -- perhaps if Olympia had been a couple of years older at least. A 40+ year old man and a 15 year old girl. Ew. That said, I just didn't see any real chemistry between the two, outside of the sexual attraction for this life long supposed great love. I almost gave up when they started writing those long letters to each other, then it picked up around page 200 into her exile and attempt to regain her son.The writing style was a little different than most I've seen, an unusual tense to take, but the prose was pleasant and lyrical. Nothing that had me so taken with the book that I lost sleep over, but I didn't end up throwing it against the wall either."
4,From a native...,"This was a fantastic read!I grew up in Biddeford, Maine, and my favorite beach there is called Fortune's Rocks. I've lived all over the country and have yet to discover a beach more beautiful, which is why the the title of the book and it's main character, Ms. Biddeford, caught my eye. I bought Fortune's Rocks because the title made me feel nostalgic and was not expecting to enjoy it as much as I did. It is brilliantly written.Ms. Shreve obviously enjoyed her time in my home town and recognized the beaty of Fortune's Rocks as it inspired her to write such an incredible novel."
4,Well done Anita,"It was one of those books that came full circle. It ties up the story very well, although it was a bit abrupt towards the end. It doesnt leave you hanging in the air. After reading a few reviews, many are/were concerned with the age differences and how society today would look upon such an act. But remember this is fiction and thats the beauty of such works. Anita can draw you in and tell a story that pushes the boundries in a way that is not all unpleasent. Dont be put off by the ages of the characters, read it because you want to expand your mind :)"
4,Good Love Story,"Very well written, an entertaining story. I read it in just two sittings. I found it a little easier to get into than her previous novels. It had a believable heroine, and I enjoyed the plot, which had several twists and ended happily."
2,Not quite Edith Wharton,"The author commented in an interview that she was such a fan of Edith Wharton that she was attempting to give this novel a Whartonesque feel. Unfortunately, only Wharton should write Wharton. She is the only one who can effectively write about the fall of women in a Victorian society. The protagonist of this book simply would not have done the things she did in her society, and without any seeming motivation or moral conflict. It is presumptive of Anita Shreve to compare her work to Wharton's, instead of presenting it as what it is - an engrossing, but completely modern novel."
1,What ever happened to Anita Shrieve,"If you have read Anita Shrieve's The Weight of Water and loved it as I did, do not read this book. The author's previous work was a beautiful and masterful work of literature and this book is fictional trash. It reminded me of the romance novels I read when I was 12. I believe that Ms Shrieve has sold her soul to the publishers who are hoping for a screen play for a television mini-series. I was terribly disapointed in the author and know she is capable of a much higher level of writing. It's depressing to think that she has compromised her work to such a degree."
4,A refreshing change,"Having finished ""The Weight of Water"", which I enjoyed, I decided to give this book a try. The 19th century style language was a little unfarmiliar to me, yet a refreshing change from past novels I've read recently. I felt for Olympia as a confused young woman. John, however, should've known better, especially with a family. I was disappointed with Shreves' discription of the towns. I live on the New Hampshire seacoast and I could not picture any of settings. All in all I really enjoyed this book- a very fast read."
1,Incredibly disappointing,"A 41 year old molests a 15 year old. There is nothing romantic, engaging or entertaining about this sad tale."
4,The original,"I think Hammett predated even Raymond Chandler so if Chandler is the grandfather of hardboiled detective stories, Hammett is the great grandfather. Sam Spade is the original tough guy and even though like with Chandler's Marlowe, you can't help thinking Humprhey Bogart did it a little better in the movie, it's still a good read. Not a lot of action by today's standards but if you liked the movie, you'll like the book, they're very close in terms of plot."
5,The original detective story,"Good read, the original noir detective story with all the various workings with came to love. Iwas however really surprised by the ending. I did not see that coming and was satisfied with the protagonist resolution, even if it's not nice, it's you know, becoming."
4,Slow start but picks up,"I've started this book a few times only to put it down. Determined to read it, I pressed on and found a decent story on the other side. Hammet is no Chandler but he makes some interesting choices for villians and does a fine job of making measurably weaker men to Spade darkly dangerous."
3,This story is an okay detective story.,"The Maltese Falcon did not knock my socks off, as I would expect a classic to do. Perhaps my expectations were too high. It is set in the 1920's, well before my time. Perhaps that is why I enjoy the James Patterson Cross series. The Maltese Falcon is the first Hammett book that I read."
3,The catalyst but by no means master,"Sorry, folks, but while Hammett may have started it all his prose simply can't touch Chandler's or Macdonald's and the fact is, theirs makes his look like Timothy Dalton alongside Sean Connery."
5,the best of the genre,"It's difficult for me to think of another detective novel which can stand up to 'The Maltese Falcon' in the way of story and overall quality. Hammett's prose is perhaps the cleanest i've ever seen short of Fitzgerald and Joyce, and his novels are fast paced and intellectually stimulating.While others like Chandler (who is also an excellent writer) do a fine job of emulating Hammett's writing, there is simply no substitute.I would put 'The Maltese Falcon' very near the top of my reading list with 'Red Harvest' close behind."
2,Typos and incorrect words in sentences,"This version of the book has a large amount of typos, some of which require a bit of thought to figure out.It also has a lot of the completely wrong word appearing in sentences and collections of letters which are not words I've ever come across, nor has the dictionary.I'm sure this is a very good book, but these errors spoil it. I have never read a book with this amount of errors in it."
5,A true jewel of the noir genre!,"This story is still just as fresh as the day it was written in 1928. Hammett has created a masterpiece with this book. The story is so real and genuine that it's hard to believe that it's out of his imagination. Hammett can create atmosphere like no one else, and his love and knowledge for 1920's San Fransico comes out loud and clear in these pages. It's also easy to see that Hammett writes from experience. This is a Hard-boiled detective story, and it stands alone and above anything that followed after. Hammett's Sam Spade breathes life on the pages, just as he did in the early movie version with Humphrey Bogart. The dialogue is so good in this book, that it was lifted off in its entirety for the movie. Anyone that calls himself or herself a detective story afficiondo, must read this book."
4,Very Enjoyable with a Nifty Mystery,"I am a huge fan of the police procedural and mystery genre. It was only natural that I go back and read one of the early key novels in this genre.The book was fun to read, with the good ole fashioned hard boiled talk that one would expect.Sam Spade makes for a very interesting character. I love the way he can just toss aside would be lovers, friends, and partners as long as it serves his purpose in solving the case and looking good. Spade is not at all sympathetic, in fact few characters in this novel were.The mystery itself was good clean fun; nothing amazing or incredibly convoluted like a P.D. James novel, but nifty none the less.Recommended reading for any bibliophile and people interested in the police procedural/private detective genre. I think Spade adequately lays the foundation for the private eyes of today: Elvis Cole and even Kinsey Millhone."
3,"If you've seen the movie, it's too late to read the book...","I'll start by saying that this really is an excellent book. The writing is tight, the plot moves and twists, and the characters are memorable. But I've seen the movie. Quite a few times. And I didn't get anything new out of the book. A couple of extra subplots (very minor). A little bit of color (literally). But that's it.Obviously, the book came first, so if we're giving credit for creating the work, Dashiell Hammett gets all the kudos. The plot belongs to him, the characters belong to him, even the dialogue belongs to him. (The dialogue in the book is, word-for-word, the same as the movie.) It's a fantastic bit of writing. But if you've seen the movie, there's not a lot of reason to read the book."
1,Not Unabridged,"The Maltese Falcon (Audio dramatization)This is with regard to the audiobook only: This is not an unabridged recording of the book. Despite the word ""unabridged"" appearing several times in the Amazon description, this is, in fact, a condensed dramatization of the book. Nothing wrong with that, if that's what you're looking for, but if you want to hear the text as Hammett wrote it, this isn't for you. The way this item is listed on Amazon is extremely misleading."
3,Does not live up to its reputation.,"Very dated, and the characters seem two dimensional. Compares poorly to many other authors of that era/genre, especially Raymond Chandler."
2,Visual style not fit for a book,"First, let me say that the writing is very good. I did not enjoy it as much as I hoped because it's not a true detective / murder mystery type. Spade hardly did investigating and instead seemed to stumble into clue after clue and run into a key character here and there. The writing style emphasized the characters and their expressions more than the plot. It was not quite what I expected. The writing was so good that it was very easy to imagine every scene and every character nuance, but it cannot be classified as a murder mystery."
2,Disappointing,"I am sorry but I am going to have to disagree with almost everyone who has written a review for The Maltese Falcon. Whether it is because I am used to reading Crais and Lehane and found a real shortage of action in this book, or whether it was because the characters were so unbelievable (if Gutman had said ""By Gad sir"" any more, I may have had to slit my wrists!) I know this book is 70 years or more old, but I just didn't find the conversations realistic. Anyway, I am sure my review won't put people off once they read everyone else's five star reviews, but just a word of warning, if you are used to people like Elvis Cole, you will just be disappointed by Sam Spade."
3,THE MALTESE FAKE,"With the publishing of this novel came an entirely new form of mystery novel-the hard boiled genre. Dashiel Hammett was clearly an expert at crafting these types of novels. With this particular one, however, I could not get past the language (cuss words) and the dark nature of Sam Spade, the main character, long enough to get any true enjoyment out of it."
2,The Maltese Falcon,"This novel has some campy appeal since it introduces us to the famous Sam Spade, the morally ambiguous, hard drinking, but devastatingly attractive private eye. The rest of the characters in this short novel don't amount to much, and as a result I didn't find the plot of much interest either. I have to believe that this novel was voted onto the Radcliffe List at least partly on the strength of the movie that was based on it."
1,The Book Thats Not All That Great!,I didnt really enjoy reading this book. It wasnt very exciting. The only reason i read it is because i was forced to for a school project. the book literally put me to sleep several times while reading it. i recommmend reading Death in Venice. I really like tadzio.
2,"great book, ham-fisted audio production","This is hard to listen to. Having the actors read the narration in character was a huge mistake, creating an endless series of cringe-inducing moments. Some talented people made this, and they mostly do fine when delivering straight dialogue. But when they start describing the action in character, it goes off the rails, time and time again. There are also a lot of jarring musical bumpers that are mixed a lot louder than the preceding voices and don't work particularly well as a result. All that aside, there are some decent characterizations here, particularly Kasper Gutman."
5,Is anything better in the genre?,"With prose that crackles off the page like the popping of a manual typewriter, Hammet probably influenced American prose style as much as Hemmingway or Eliot. Although Chandler stated Hammet's writing never really stuck with you, kind of fading out of the mind, the writing in this excellent novel is taut and polished. The story is great, with a few genuinely memorable personalities."
5,Sam Spade is the King of cool.,"Private Detective Sam Spade epitomizes cool. Even while dealing with foriegners, psychopaths, angry police, a mysterious fat man, and a femme fatale, he still maintains an air of coolness, that hangs in the air around him like the smoke of his freshly rolled cigarettes."
5,Interesting and hard to put down!,"The other night I started ""The Dispossessed"" by Ursula Le Guin. I read for a few pages and struggled to pay attention. My thoughts wandered. There was nothing there to hook me. It was boring. I put it down.The next day I started this book. I was hooked by the second page. I stayed up late to finish it.The book is about Sam Spade, a detective agent in San Francisco. Spade is hired by multiple people to find a statue falcon and results in murder, double-crossing, and betrayal. You know, all that good stuff. It is said to be one of the best detective mysteries written, but I don't read enough of them to know. I do know it was very good.It's not a profound book. It doesn't deal with many ""great ideas."" It's not going to change your life, but it will be a great experience.Josh Sowinfireandknowledge.org"
4,The damsel in distress & the mystery bird,"When a beautiful red-head comes to Private Investigator Sam Spade's office asking him to help find her sister Sam does not believe her story for a minute. A wise man is Sam. For her story is just a front to find a missing treasure that people will kill for. Soon enough Sam's partner is dead and the police are trying to pin his death on Sam. For his own good he has to solve the mystey the red-head landed in his lap.Not having seen the movie of the same name I didn't know what to expect of this story, except that it is labelled a 'classic'. I found this an easy read, and a reasonably short novel. The solution mystery wasn't obvious till near the end and Sam is a classic hard boiled detective. The original man of few words. If you enjoy a good mystery this is one you should read if only see how little, in some ways, this genre has changed over the years."
2,doesn't translate,"Knowing that The Maltese Falcon is a bit of a classic in the noir genre, I wanted to give it a read. Perhaps this novel was good back when it was written, but I don't think it works today. Sam Spade is chauvanistic and almost comical at times. His language makes him a caricature. Mostly it was hard for me to take this seriously. It almost felt like a parody of 1920's detective novels. Perhaps that was the way people actually acted back then, but for me it just didn't ring true.Carl Alves - author of Two For Eternity"
3,The movie was better than the book,I was dissappointed but its not Hammett's fault. The characters are too familliar since film makers for decades have borrowed from these characters. My problem is I had a hard time distinguishing Spade from Bogie and Cairo from Peter Lorre. As I read the dialogue Bogie's voice was delivering the lines. I can fully appreciate why the American Film Institute rates the movie so highly. But I'm not rating the movie but the book and I did not enjoy it as much as I would have anticipated. It reads more like a screenplay than a novel. No wonder Hammett made his fame and fortune in Hollywood..
2,Hard time not pressing eject.,"Michael Prichard is no William Dufris whom I experienced listening to 'The Thin Man'. He was fabulously diverse.This book was tediously, unnecessarily, overly descriptive. At first I thought it was Prichards' stiff, non-inflexive, unimaginitive reading style that was bothering me but that wasn't the half of it! Did Hammett get paid by the syllable on this one? I found Brigids character annoying, not sympathetic or likable. I wanted to reach right through my ipod and slap her to make her stop repeating the same lame sentences over and over. I'm not a big Bogart fan but HE is more intriguing and 'lovable' than the Spade depicted in Hammetts' original writing. He seemed dull of wit and had no class. I guess he and Brigid were made for each other. I know from reading other Hammett books that he is better than this, so what's the hubub about? (The movie I guess.) Someone should have told him the truth before printing and gotten a better rewrite."
5,One of the best detective stories,"After a second reading of this book years later I still can say this is one of my favorite books. The first time I read this I was in high school and just starting to find my true love of reading. Since taste in literature was limited and I really only read two authors, my Dad recommended this to me. I had nothing else to read and it would be months before I had a new book so I gave it a try. Sam Spade is my favorite type of detective. The whole Noir style novel is one of my favorite types. Spade gets the job done but maybe not by the best of methods which makes for an interesting story. Some of the characters are a bit cheesy but considering how old this book is I can understand.This is just a fun read for Mystery lovers. It is shorter than most of the books I have read recently but it is fun to escape into this book from time to time. It has been over a decade since I read it the first time but it still holds a special place on my book shelf."
5,Life isnt Ha Ha He He,"As the reader/online reviewer above Saima Huq states, much to her disbelief and unsatisfaction this is NOT a story about ""PAKISTANI BRITISH"" Girls in England but about ""INDIAN BRITISH"" Girls and their tales of their lives. Very interesting book...Every INDIAN BRITISH can probably relate..."
2,Perhaps a B book at best,"while syal successfuly captures the punjabi culture and the complexities of living between two cultures, the plot is more like a made for tv movie than a novel. syal wavers between a style of writing that is beautiful and flowery and then just plain hasty and trite. many of syal's descriptions of events can only be described as cheesy and to top things off, this book is littered with small grammatical errors. while it was definetly an entertaining read i have to admit i was disapointed by a book that started off with such promise and just trailed off into mediocrity."
4,Better than you'd expect,"Almost every song is good. Some great. Some of his versions are arguably better than other bands' recorded versions (The Sorrows etc.). A lot of crisp rolling 'freakbeat' and fast pop with a hard edge and some growling. Some, more melodic fat-chords experimental pop beat rock crooner vocalizing.I RATE THIS: 3.3-4.1 stars (depending on mood)."
1,It could have been better w/out skold.,"This, the last album from the once-invincible KMFDM, was created by a core of Sascha K. and Skold. Gunther and En Esch made only brief appearances, as did Nina Hagen, Ogre, and William Rieflin. This album has ten tracks, over saturated with programming from Sascha and Skold, and it all blends together after awhile. No track, aside from D.I.Y., really stands out. They also seemed to be confused as to who was singing. En Esch sings on like three songs. On some tracks, the credits lists four vocalists. They should have just started MDFMK w/out the remnants from what used to be a good band. It wasn't wise to include Skold in this project, Sascha should have waited for MDFMK."
3,"Its good KMFDM, but not their best","I expected a little more from KMFDM, but they did deliver some good cuts. ""Today"" is very smooth and it is easily my favorite from the new album. The guitar is barely noticable in some songs. I think some more guitar would have given the album a little more edge. The beats are quite developed which drive most of the album. Overall, I would put this album in the mid-range of my KMFDM collection."
2,Tim-Tim and Sascha Need a Beatdown,"So the last album was really good. Right. And the best track was Anarchy with Tim Skold, so the new album with Tim working fulltime was going to be awesome. Right!? Nope. A major letdown. KMFDM has gone out with a beep. Picture KMFDM doing acid house techno... poorly. The highlights of the album are the Ogre tracks which sound like Skinny Puppy doing acid house techno. Otherwise not worth your money."
3,What happend!,"Well...call it what you will, but it's probably not! Adios & D.I.Y. are my pics of the albulm. But where my love for KMFDM lies within AGNST, NAIVE, and MONEY......But don't worry the ultra heavy beat of MDFMK is coming."
3,KMFDM dead??,"Without Raymond Watts, co-founder of KMFDM, Sascha pulls it off very well. I just don't believe that KMFDM is truly dead. In the meantime, we'll just have to wait for the ""Black Broth"", Pig's new album. Will Sascha have anything to do with it?"
4,Over and out and down the drain,"This is a great KMFDM disc! Not as incredible in some respects as previous attempts but very good nonetheless! I agree that the general consensus on 'That's all' and 'DIY' (Do it yourself?) are the best and some of the best work KMFDM's ever done. I like 'Today' a lot!? I'm not sure why people wouldn't... it's a lot different but it's good. 'Witness' has some crazy lyrics on it, but it is cool on occasion. The rest are all great too, especially 'Adios'. Anyhow... try it out!"
4,This album was interesting enough,"Well shoot, KMFDM's done gone an done it now boys. Those dangolewarmbeerdrinkinEurotrashsombeeches have mixed up a pretty good album. I mean, I miss the ole clangily guitars and that funkilicious En Esch voice. But, you know, that ole Tim Skold is funky. I mean, he gets his cool little groove going on ""Today"" and he sounds good. And that ""DIY"" song has appeal to us folks with band expierence. You know, whoever they sampled that good classic groove off of is OK with me. Anyway, if you like KMFDM you should buy this album. It is not the greatest but it's alright."
3,disappointing..,by far i was extremely disappointed with this album... tim is not a great contribution to kmfdm.. i was in fact really looking forward to this album before its release and then once i received it i wondered for what reason was there such a lack of en esch.... just about the only thing i enjoyed was ogre... all and all there are definately better kmfdm albums than this..
4,I am here to eat my words. Curses!!,"So, a few weeks ago i came on here and wrote a one star review of Adios. It is humble pie time, becaus i have been listening to it non-stop recently, and i have, embarassingly, totally changed my tune. I have thought long and hard about it, Adios is a great album. But I still haven't changed my mind about Nina Hagen, the woman is terrible, and the song she sings the main vocals on, which i have tried to put out of my mind (successfully, because i have forgotten the name) is an absolute travesty, ugh, horrible horrible song. But Adios, Beriet, Rubicon and the others are great stuff. Still maybe not as good as The other albums, but it is different, anyway. So different tht it took me a couple of months to get into it. But i admire their nerve, putting out an album that somehow seems calculated to annoy long-term fans. What a bizarre band."
5,wonderful last cd,"ADIOS was a wonderful last album for a pioneering band with an illustrious history. KMFDM was renowned for a new sound every album, but adios is amazingly unique. There is a much heavier emphasis on electronics that gives the music a smooth, quiet, and groovy feel. The song Sycophant is an example of the fruition of their flirtations with reggae, although its lyrics could have been more well-thought out. Skold worked very hard to ruin this album, but ogre stepped in with 'thats all' and 'full worm garden' to save the day. That chick that does vocals for Witness, that's Nina f'in Hagen, a legendary goth revolutionary godzilla. With cds like this, it breaks my heart that kmfdm broke up.Oh well, that's life. Could be worse. Kmfdm could have reformed without Esch and Schulz, as a conventional american metal band, and Skold could use kmfdm as a stepping stone to get into a pop group. Thank god that didn't happen."
2,Feels like a contract holdover,Though there are some truly killer tunes on this album (WITNESS and FULL WORM GARDEN being the best) most of it feels like unfinished music released to fulfill a contract obligation. Which I believe it is. This was the last album they did for WAX TRAX and easily their weakest work to date.But then coming on the heels of the 1997 expletive album (which was easily one of the best industrial dance records ever!) most anything will sound dissapointing. The next album as MDFMK is much better. So I beleive they pushed this out just to get out of WAX TRAX.
2,help,yes. i know this is not a review but i do have a question. What does KMFDM mean? i've been listening to the music for some time now and i just haen't bothered to figure out what KMFDM stands for. someone help me out please!
1,KMFDM: Take Singing Lessons,"KMFDM sound as if the microphone accidently slipped down the throat of the lead singer. It is amazing these guys have a record contract. Note to all kareoke fans: Swallow the mic, keep recording, and send a demo to TVT/Wax Trax Records and you'll get a contract. P.S. Dress in all black, write some controversal lyrics, and maintain a look resembling a middle-school drop-out and you will be off with your dream of being a ""recording artist"". Move over KMFDM!"
3,It's the upcoming MDFMK not the Old KMFDM,"it was good for a techno album, but i was expecting machine-gun guitars, a lot of loud angry shouts and some electronics. I thought it was more enjoyable to wait for hte release than actually listening to all tn songs.It's OK i bought it because it is their last album. Don't get me wrong, it was good, but not that good"
3,Good stuff? Absolutely! KMFDM? Not really...,"It appears KMFDM have already left the building. While this is undeniably cool in many parts, it's also undeniably -not- KMFDM in many parts. I haven't been a fan of Tim Skold's vocals since his arrival and this CD is chock full of him. The result - a CD that sounds like the bastard child of an unholy union between KMFDM, Low Pop Suicide and, the parent it resembles the most, Lords Of Acid. This Lords of Acid essence peaks with Nina Hagen's ultra-strange track: ""Witness"". The track would fit wonderfully on LoA's Voodoo-U CD, but here it's simply way out of character. The KMFDM I know and love finally pushes through the techno beats on track 7: ""That's All""...but by then, the end is approaching much too quickly. (Ultimately, 4-5 stars for what it is...but 3 stars as a KMFDM CD) If Skold's lightweight vocals are the future of MDFMK, then I'm not looking forward to it. Me? I'll stick with En Esch's next project - whatever it may be."
4,Fantastic Torch,I wouldn't say the Marvel Legends line are educational. But these figures are sure great to look at. This figure is great to play around with but I usually just have it in poses to display.
2,Verbatim Core for HP 20111124,"This is a worthless review, but a review where I learned that amazon.com really tries to make the customer as happy as possible. The core arrived. I was traveling. The core said empty when inserted in the printer. I was past the 30 days when I called. I was given a token compensation. I had a core that was taken to recycling. I learned a lesson about the 30-day rule. I am ..., well ..., not happy but I am happy. See, I wrote at the beginning that this was a worthless review! So, ..."
2,Saccharine-sweet biography of country's first family,"Given their lofty stature and influence on country music, there are oddly (or perhaps not so; they guarded their privacy offstage) few books or printed materials available on the Carter Family. While this sweet overview is not inaccurate or bad, it's value is primarily for completists. For almost thirty years after this volume was printed it was THE source of information on the Carters; but virtually everything in this book is included in the more comprehensive Will You Miss Me When I'm Gone."
2,Ordinary and dull,It's amazing what a masterpiece (Once upon a time in America movie) was done from such an ordinary book.It is really not worth reading.
2,The book isn't a patch on the movie.,"Sergio Leone's ""Once Upon a Time in America"" is one of the greatest gangster epics ever made. It's also based on this book which it took me six years to track down (a hugely impressive feat on the part of amazon.com). How a poorly written piece of cheap fiction like this managed to inspire one of the greatest works of modern cinema is way beyond me. Advice to other fans of the movie: your time will be much better spent locating the full-length, uncut version of the movie. And let me know when you find a copy."
5,My 40+ yr old paperback copy finally disintegrated!,"As an impressionable highschooler back in the 50's this book was so interesting I have never forgotten the characters after all these years. The mental images of the New York tenements, the bathroom in the hallway which was shared by these apartment dwellers....the progression of the tough kids growing up. The film 'Once Upon A Time In America' was one of the few movies where your memories of the written story were not distorted by a screenplay version. This is a book that I had to hide, lest my mother would find it and kill me!! I had similar hidden 'treasures of literature' of the same scandalous nature such as Peyton Place, From Here to Eternity, The Amboy Dukes....these were all very controversial in the 50's because they were about sex and profanity...my, how times have changed!"
4,"A terse, gangster tale","This book is the only one i've ever read with a narrative from a gangster.It's chock full of vice,circa teens and roaring twenties details and slang that i regard as pretty much priceless.I love the Sergio Leone epic, and the graceful violence and nostalgia, but i've come to regard the book and the film as two seperate entities. The book is not really much of an epic. It's the plainly stated tale of Jewish gangsters ( a rarity these days. I should know. I'm Jewish).And it's accessible for two reasons: For one,it's straightforward, but also, i think people, assuming this book ever gets back in print, will be fascinated by the anectdotes and episodes of violence."
5,AMAZING BOOK,"Once Upon a Time in America is an amazing movie, and once I found out that this was the book it was based on I had to read it; it did not disappoint.I recommmend this to anyone who loves anything about the underworld. My father always said that one of his Uncles may have been in this crew."
3,Interesting bit of history,"This is the book that was the basis for Sergio Leone's 'Once Upon a Time in America'. As a novel it's passable but nothing special. As a glimpse into the world of Jewish gangsters in the '30s told by one of the survivors, it's interesting. At least the book is not as ambiguous as the famous last scene of the film and more plausible. I was happy to find it in an inexpensive Kindle edition."
4,LOVE 'EM,I LOVE most of the various Osmonds music and this is no exception. They surpass expectations. Well done mix of their country hits.
1,So boring,"Just giving people a warning here. This game is very dull. The voice acting is poor, the dialogue is juvenile, and you can complete the game using a couple of buttons (just keep trying to hit something, maybe move around a little and eventually you'll kill it). Also, I have no idea why it is rated M. I wasn't looking for a gore fest or anything like that but this game would really be ok for a 12 year old (or younger) to play. Don't waste your money, please."
5,"Very Direct, Very Helpful","This book is simple. It is direct. It gives practical, beneficial advice for couples who want to maintain or re-create the intimacy in their relationship. I enjoyed it immensely and give it a rating of 5 stars for its excellent approach and its simplistic style. If you want more intimacy, get this book!"
4,Excellent when combined with (included) DVD,"I heartily reccommend the book especially when you supplement it with the DVD that comes with it. Between the book and the DVD demonstrations you can develop a sense of what you can do with each program and (very importantly) how far you don't want to go (at least not yet.)What a relief after sorting through a number of books on Photoshop Elements 3 (PS-3) that porport to be useable for Mac when in fact direction is almost exclusively Windows. iPhoto 5 will make you glad you are back in Mac country and will probably be able to most of your editing right there, without going on to PS-3. (The exception is layers, for which you have to go into PSE-3) but only really advanced photographers use this. And who knows, at this rate, iLife '06 might have layers, clone stamp etc as well. Apple is on a good roll here with iPhoto, as indicated by the fact that the editing possible is so much more powerful than in iLife '04."
3,Pope RULES,This guy is the real deal. His credibility is so rare when it comes to the subject of UFOs. It is very refreshing to hear accounts from someone I feel I can trust! So cool. This is the sort of information that makes you feel a little paranoid just knowing.
2,So so,"I'm a pretty big Marc Bolan and T. Rex fan, but I still found this release somewhat unsatisfying. Songs like ""Hippy Gumbo"" and ""Mustang Ford"" just lack the magic that is ever-present on his later (early 70's) material. Other tracks, such as ""Lunacy's Back"", and ""Cat Black"", hint at his potential as a song writer and mystical lyricist, but again, leave much to be desired. All this is forgivable, of course, as most of this is demoed material, and not really intended for mass release. This is only for absolute die-hard fans of Bolan, so I would not recommend this to the casual T.Rex listener. Start with Electric Warrior and The Slider, then move on to the earlier stuff, if you still have the craving..."
5,Among the best,"Year of Jubilo ranks with Cold Mountain, Killer Angeles and Black Flower as among the best comtemporary Civil War historical fiction. Bahr's descriptions of the smells, sounds, insects, birds, people, and places evoke a sense of time and place that transports the reader instantly to 1865. If historical novels are your preference, this one will be at the top of the list."
4,A Fantastic Story,"By the end of the novel, I was a bit tired of the whipporwills and the mockingbirds. The descriptions often got a bit out of hand, in my opinion, but the story is fantastic and Mr. Bahr has written another memorable Civil War novel. I can't wait to read ""The Judas Field""!Again, I'm scratching my head as to why ""Cold Mountain"" was so popular. Mr. Bahr tells a better story, in my opinion."
2,A Year of Words,"The author obviously thinks he is a nineteeenth writer composing a masterpiece. I could get no further into the book than the first chapter which I found stilted, wordy and affected. It can't be compared to Killer Angels which was gripping and powerful with nary a word wasted. For me The Year of Jubilo was a disappointment as I generally like historical novels especially those dealing with the Civil War. Based on other readers' reviews I guess I should have stuck with the book; it sounds like I missed a lot"
4,Harry S. is so cool!!,"You can smell the gunpowder(sort of).This provides you with an excellent snapshot of the post-civil war south. You've got free slaves, ex-rebles, a crazy grave digger and an ex slave catcher.The story is extremly solid but it does tend to go into the descriptive narative just a little too much.You will like this book if you like an above par civil war novel. In other words this book is not in the same leauge as ""North and South"".The only reason I don't give 5 stars is because of the ending, I didn't get it."
4,At Last a New BAHR,"Just purchased this book yesterday and stayed up all night to finish it....could not put it down. From the first chapter you feel part of the scene and what a tragic one it is. The Civil War has just ended, but the fighting and killing goes on. Bahr's BLACK FLOWER is a book that has stayed with me since I read it over three years ago....it is the ultimate Civil War novel and I was anxiously awaiting his new THE YEAR OF JUBILO and was not disappointed in the least....He has done it again...created a setting and characters that breathe life into the consequences of war and its aftermath. The description of the young blind boy hearing and ""seeing"" the slaughter of his mother and father by confederate ""soldiers"" sets the scene for the tragic aftermath of war and the revenge and retribution that both sides deemed necessary. Thank you Mr. Bahr for providing the reader with a part of history that has not previously been openly discussed and written about in such detail."
2,Vescera is done I guess,"Gone are the days of Windows, Animation, and The Altar, all of which had a happy sort of lilt to them. I used to be a huge Vescera fan, but this last project is awful; full of angst, Vescera just yells from one track to the next, the production is weak, a huge disappointment. Bummer :("
3,Why you shouldn't go to jail,"In my opinion this film was hard core. Ving Rhames portrayed his usual tough ghetto guy character. Personally,I stay away from his kind. And, the film clearly displays why you should stay away from him and his ideologies. Living in the inner city most of my life, I've encountered his character many times. So, I can relate to the issues protrayed in the film. Additionally, since I've never been to jail, the movie , supposedly, outlines the daily nature of the prison experience, caustic adversaries, and how to deal with them and the potential outcomes from this situation. And with a film titled ""The Animal 2"", did I get what I expected? Yes, I got education about prison life in triplicate because the acting was so real and believable."
2,Decent Low Budget Flick,This isn't the worst movie I've ever seen. The soundtrack and cinematography are alright but the plot itself is entirely unbelievable. The pacing of the story is suited more to a television series than a movie but I guess it's worth renting if you're a Ving Rhames fan.
5,As Advertised,This filter is everything K&N promised it would be. My 1999 Windstar saw a two mile per gallon increase and much better response to the gas pedal. I'm impressed.
2,Disappointment,"The other reviewers didn't like these Marzipan Rum balls, but I thought I'd try them anyway. Well, they were right,so add me to the list of disappointed buyers. They were artificial tasting and lacked any marzipan flavor."
