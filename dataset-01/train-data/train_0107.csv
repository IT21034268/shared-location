5,Best I've found,I read that Jennifer Aniston had used this forever and thought that was a good recommendation. I love it as it moisturizes without a greasy feeling - - very light. Got some for my daughter and it's all she'll use now and she has oily skin.
5,LIKE IT,I ordered it for my mom for Christmas and she was so happy as she had just run out of it that morning.
3,what size is this?,"this ad should state what size bottle this is??? is it the 3.4 oz or the 1 oznot clear at all, looks like the 3.4 oz bottle but I can't find the size listed anywhere???"
2,what were they thinking?,"Well, this is the first review I ever wrote. I bought this cd to help with my insomnia problem, but a little stress relief doesn't hurt either. Well, there are some interesting tips and advise on this cd, and I kind of liked the stress relief hypnosis section. The image of floating on a raft in warm water baking in sunshine is very relaxing. But he uses the same image again with the sleep hypnosis. A little variety would be nice!The worst part: After I finally started to doze off listening to the sleep hypnosis part I suddendly almost fell off my bed wide awake again because it was followed by a loud music and a cheerfull female voice advertising more products from Dr. Walton! What the heck were they thinking???"
3,It was ok,I would rather go to a hypnotist for your first session where they can address the actual issue or issues you may have. I am putting this cd back on ebay.
4,I thought that this CD was ok.,Some of the songs were great and the rest were for the dogs. I hate most of beats in Devil Nightmare and Get You freak on. All of these songs are great and they go with Tomb Raider.That is all. buh bye.
1,"Bad quality control, buyer beware","I bought this lamp in the floor model version. I was not able to assemble because of a missing part that was supposed to be permanently installed. Full Spectrum Solutions would only send me a replacement. Otherwise I would have to pay for shipping back to them. I did not like the quality of the lamp AND it was flawed - not my fault.So...the smart thing to do was let them send me a replacement. Then they have to pay for my shipping to them and their shipping the new one out to me. Ha! There went their profit.Even if the missing piece was there, the assemblage is awful - stuffing the wires up into the lamp - hardly enough room for them - then screwing cheap plastic to cheap plastic. I expected more for that price. Have not been able to turn it on yet. I will followup when I receive the replacement - provided I can even screw it together.Check out other brands - there is competition out there."
3,Blue Max desk lamp vs. floor lamp,Not sure that 3 * is the correct rating. I am returning the desk lamp as I can't seem to find the right angle to use it to light up my work surface. I like the type of light it throws and it is a nice kind of bright. The dimmer switch was not a real advantage. I would consider ordering the floor lamp in its place if I knew the light would be cast evenly over my work area. Not sure what my costs will be upon return. Plus - It shipped from the company quickly and came intact and the bulb was easy to insert.
1,Beware of return policy,"Bought the floor lamp three years ago. Should have read the policy more closely. I have to return the product at my expense. I have to find a box to fit this very large lamp. The burden is on me. It is there in black and white, their policy. But I didn't expect to have a problem with a lamp....after all we have lamps that are 30 years old and no problems. Do I like the lamp..yes. Do I like the service...no. Full Spectrum Solutions could do better than this."
4,A very early Laurel & Hardy,"The boys had not yet fully developed their immortal characters, but you can see the beginnings of them here.Stan and Ollie are the world`s worst detectives. They have been given the job of protecting judge Foozle (Jimmy Finlayson) fromthe murderous Tipton Slasher. Would give you a nice warm feeling wouldn`t it? Knowing that your life was in the hands of L&H.;While it`s not their best silent comedy you will still get plenty of laughs out of it."
3,Transit,It's a nice transit but I have followed all the steps to level it and I can't get it to level 360 degrees can anyone tell me a trick
3,Basic Level. Very BasicTransit,"Very poor instruction sheet.Quality of the instrument is good for basic leveling, fair for turning rough angles. Horizontal markings make it accurate to +/- 1 degree, larger than that on the veritcal."
4,Theodore Roosevelt; an Autobiography,A real American hero. A very interesting acount of dedication and perseverence of a down to earth President. The book is well written.
2,"Couldn't finish it, or maybe i did. i cant remember","He is one of my favorite presidents that i have read the least about. i don't mean to sound crazy, but i am a ferocious reader and this book wore me down. it started good and glossed over every part i wanted his personal view on. it was written during the falling out with taft/pissed at everybody phase of his life and the second half of the book turns into a babbling run on ranting sentence like this one. in short, some people are not meant to write about themselves."
4,Focused Concentration,The reading requires a certain amount of focused concentration to comprehend the literary language of the era. Powerful eloquence would be an appropriate descriptor.
5,Teddy Rides Again !,This book should be required reading for any student of American history. In it we learn how Theodore Roosevelt became one of America's greatest presidents. In his own words we can go back in time and see our country as he sawIt. It was a time in America when great wrongs were righted and great deeds we're done.I THOROUGHLY loved this book !Olin B.
5,Good story telling,I have just started to read it. I am reading it aloud to someone and find the phrasing a bit challenging but well worth the effort.
4,Theodore Roosevelt Autobiography,Very interesting I like to read biographies. Is interesting to know more about our Presidents past and present. I am still reading on it.
1,Sorry Teddy,"Sorry to be the pooper but this party is so extremely overrated it's sad. Teddy Roosevelt is a man's man and one of my favorite presidents but, at least in this instance, he's a pretty poor writer. I'm sorry to say that I just couldn't stomach the book it was so poorly written and I had to close it after choking down a little over half its contents. I know it must have been very painful for Teddy but he doesn't even mention his first wife, the love of his life, Alice. How can an autobiography be complete with valuable pieces of information missing?If you're looking for a good book try his biography written by Nathan Miller, ""Theodore Roosevelt, A Life."" Miller is a far better writer and seems to capture the Roosevelt that we all know and love. I have passed this book on to several friends and they have all come away with a heaping helpin' of respect for our 26th President.Again, I have to apologize to Teddy but there are just some folks who should not put pen to paper."
5,Bully!,"Teddy is definitely an egomaniac, but he does write well. He also benefits from a good plot, his extrodanary life. Jolly good read."
1,This man ...,"... was at first by his character and education a fasist with all his mind about chosen people, white Americans and him as Caucasian!!He is a shame in American history and foreraner of expanionistic politics of America.Sorry!"
4,a pretty good book,"Normaly I do not like autobiographies.I would just read them for school. But this one is pretty good. He writes in a style so that it's easy to keep reading, and easy to follow, even though he rabbit trails quite a bit. So over all I'd say, since it's free, buy it."
3,Good,"Written in his own words, this autobiography displays a personal side of Teddy Roosevelt. This does not replace a fully researched historical biography, but was easy to read."
5,"Teddy Roosevelt, the type of man our country needs","Teddy Roosevelt is the type of man our country needs. This book is a great picture of a man who gave of himself for others, who looked out for the interests of the common man, the poor, the needy, and yet didn't condemn the prosperous man either. He contended with those who would use injustice for personal gain and attacked wickedness wherever he found it. My hope is for God to raise up more men and women like T. Roosevelt in our country."
3,Good book,"Good book, great man, long read! This is a good book, just a little long. I browsed through for topics of interest to me."
3,good but hard to read,"T Roosevelt had a great life and is an inspiring person, but this book was writing in the early 20th century when they didn't believe in paragraphs. It's very long winded and talks about relationships that i find unimportant when trying to understand someone's life. It's full of good info, but a little tough to get through."
4,Teddy Roosevelt.(Autobio.) .great book,"Theodore Roosevelt: An AutobiographyIt's like he's speaking in the future, history is important, very smart man."
3,Decent Headphones,"I was tring to replace some head phones that I use for my PC. I wanted the larger style ear pieces, a long cord, plus an in-line external volume control. These headphone have all of this, but they are still missing something. The volume control, is very cheap feeling, and does not have much range. The Ear pieces are comforable for a short time, but become annoying after an hour or so. The sound quality is to be expected, there is some loss of quality in the low tones, and it doesn't reproduce low bass drops.Overall these were a good buy for the price, if you need high quality you just have to pay more. But if your like me and haveing had a hard time finding that exteranl, in-line volume control, I would give these a shot"
5,Not a copy of Tolkien or Robert Howard !,At last a fantasy world that is not a pale imitation of The lord of The Rings or Conan. its amazingly good and unique.
5,A Classic!,"This is one of the all-time great classics which every reader of science-fiction and fantasy should have. In many ways it is a brilliant example of what one could term science-fantasy sharing aspects of both genres. Each of the six stories is a masterpiece and one can see why Jack Vance was selected as one of the ""Grand Masters"" of science fiction.The ebook is well formatted with an excellent table of contents and includes information about the author, a link to the Gateway Science fiction website, and a useful list of other books by Vance organized according to the various series to which each work belongs.This is an excellent buy!"
3,Classic of the Genre,"Jack Vance's 'The Dying Earth' is not a novel, but rather a series of loosely connected stories set in a far future Earth, where the Sun is red, scattered humans live on the detritus of past civilizations and magic is common.When I first read this more than a decade ago I quite enjoyed it, as I had never read anything quite like it. Reading it again I am not quite as impressed. Still it is definitely a landmark achievement in fantasy, his ideas have been a big influence in the genre (including the 'cast and forget' magic system in Dungeons and Dragons). If you read it and much of it feels familiar remember Vance did it first more than 50 years ago."
4,Super Reader,"A science fantasy, perhaps? This is also the book that in some form the Dungeons and Dragons game appropriate the basic model for their magicsystem from way back when.Set waaaaaaaaaayyyyy into the future, bizarre creatures and peopleabound, as does the ability to memorise and cast one-shot 'magicspells'.Dying Earth : 1 Turjan of Miir - Jack VanceDying Earth : 2 Mazirian the Magician - Jack VanceDying Earth : 3 T'sais - Jack VanceDying Earth : 4 Liane the Wayfarer - Jack VanceDying Earth : 5 Ulan Dhor Ends a Dream - Jack VanceDying Earth : 6 Guyal of Sfere - Jack VanceMaking people and magic.3.5 out of 5Spell use needs to be judicious.4 out of 5Master magician, live sword, wayfarers and witches.3 out of 5Witchy Lith.3 out of 5Magic investigations and an air-car.3.5 out of 5Inquistive adventurer finds bunches of info.3 out of 5"
1,Good product - terrible instructions,"This product arrived with zero instuctions in the package, only a serial number card and cd with dubious software. I destroyed my motherboard before the intructions were retrieved from the Ratoc Systems Website. I think that this could be a useful product if it was accompanied by good instructions."
3,Not compatible with all SCSi devices,"Intel Imac running OS X 10.4.11 trying to connect to Canon FS4000US film scanner. No luck.Even though I could connect to it (the adapter) after some fiddling I could never get the scanner to show up as a SCSI device.Called Ratoc and they said the Canon FS4000US was ""unsupported"".You may want to check Ratoc's website to see if the hardware is supported before you buy (they have a pretty detailed list by manufacturer).Seems like a good product but didn't work for my equipment combination. Returned for a refund."
4,Actually works....so far.,"Got an old 1GB Jazz drive to work on my MacBook Pro with OS 10.5.7. YOU MUST read ALL documentation though, AND go to their website and read some more. Pretty much you have to run their software first, reboot, then 'disable' their utility program. Very odd. Didn't need a HD 50 pin terminator for the Jazz drive cause it's built in the drive. Seemed to work, good luck!"
5,Some Important Product Details,"Label: Barooni Catalog#: BAR003 Format: CD Country: Netherlands Released: 1991 Genre: Electronic Style: Future Jazz, Experimental, Ambient Notes: Eating And Sleeping (#15) was commisioned by the City Of Groningen in 1987. Tracklisting:1 Part One (18:34) 2 Part Two (14:26) 3 Part Three (16:30)"
3,Weak Tea,"Of the 3 T-Model Ford releases as of this date, this is by far the weakest. While there are a some good songs, there are several failed experiments (the remix is very bad). The raw guitar energy that characterizes his other two discs seems to come up short here.I just had to comment on the previous reviewers accusations. There are too many fantastic Ft Possum releases (like RL Burnside's ""Burnside on Burnside) for this theory to have any validity. I do think that the folks at Fat Possum understand some of the underlying connections betweeen Punk and Blues and have managed to market their music into places where there is not normally much interest. I think this is great as it expands everyone's listening and cultural horizons.I find it quite cynical to take a poor example of the record label and use it to put forth some kind of racist conspiracy throry. Too dismiss an entire label's artists as being untalented and exploited based on a bad record astonishes me."
4,T-Model casts a world for everyone to become part of.,"This is T-Model sitting under a tree inviting all people to come and enjoy his presence. Talk to him about taildragger and shake his hand and thank him for catching the world by the tail and taking humanity along. No stone unturned, everyone is called to help his life unfold. Ask him questions and he will direct you to a better day, playing two guitars with one hand, enjoying a drink, admiring beautiful women, singing to them his song of courtship. The day is long and time is short. Grab onto T-Model's cane and dance to his rhythms, enjoy this music and make his voice heard around the world. A reveiw by Olen Perkins"

4,KEVIN GOES SPACEY,"THE USUAL SUSPECTS is an unusual, well-crafted, if ultimately mystifying movie. Kevin Spacey won his first Oscar for his supporting role as the narrative force behind the drama. A plot as thick as New England molasses unfolds in flashbacks and present day, and with Spacey telling the story, what's truth and what is fiction? There are some interesting twists throughout the movie, and of course, the final one is a doozie, although if you watch the film closely, you can see it coming.Along with Spacey, director Bryan Singer gets good performances from Pete Postelthwaite as a conniving attorney; Stephen Baldwin, Kevin Pollak, Benicio Del Toro as members of the gang; and a good performance from Gabriel Byrne, the supposed mastermind of the gang.The identity of Kayser Solce is key to the film, and it's revelation forms the big surprise at the end.Well done, but not the classic others feel."
5,WOW!!!,All I can really say is this movie has one of the best endings ever! I was totally blown away the first time I saw it! My jaw dropped! Great cast! Great storyline! Great acting! Suspensful and unforgetable! Make this movie a part of your collection!
2,What's the Fuss?,"Part of the 'cult' appeal of this film, I'm fairly sure, lies in its trick ending. This is all very well, but it's not a trick ending in the sense that it provides any clue to preceding events. This reduces it to nonsense. The Usual Suspects is well acted, though shoddily filmed, clearly low-budget and cringingly self conscious. The premise itself - five criminals rounded up by a character who may or may not be Kaiser Szoze to commit a crime that we are never sure was actually committed - is the stuff of graduate film school. It's clever, but finally not clever enough. If you're going to take the best part of two hours to play an elaborate hoax, make sure the hoax is worth waiting for. This isn't. Don't give youself a headache trying to figure out what the ending really means. It doesn't mean anything at all. This, apparently, is Bryan Singer's 'trick' on his audience. Let's hope that Bryan is quite finished."
2,Shameful Blu-Ray release - no extras whatsoever,"I feel like a broken record at this point. Let's get one thing straight: I really enjoy The Usual Suspects. And the SE DVD has some great special features on it. So what does this Blu-Ray get? Bupkus. Thanks, guys. You won't be getting any of my money until you start respecting the consumer and release a proper Blu-Ray with AT LEAST all the standard DVD extras ported over."
2,too complex for comfort,"granted, this movie has a very clever ending. yet the other 90% of it simply left me scratching my head. not that i can never think while watching a movie, but a movie this convoluted needs a map or something."
3,"Entertaining, violent crime caper","You have a chance to see many of your fave actors, obviously having a good time with this romp. The movie is tongue in cheek and asks that you suspend disbelief. Do si, and enjoy the suspense instead!"
3,Kevin Spacey - WOW,"Kevin Spacey should be in every movie. How many ""Oscars"" does he have? He SHOULD have one for every movie he's ever been in - especially this one!"
1,Didn't review my DVD.,"I have never had any problems purchasing items from Amazon, so I was shocked when I saw that this DVD arrived at my place two weeks, ago when it never did. Will not buy from this supplier again. Have no idea where the item is. . . ."
3,Exercise in futility,"To paraphrase Jeff Shannon's fair warning: a) this production ultimately makes little or no sense at all, and; b) the final scene renders the entire movie pointless. An enjoyable cast (Kevin Spacey, Gabriel Byrne, Chazz Palmintieri, Stephen Baldwin, Kevin Pollak, Benicio Del Toro) pursues a twisted plot where much suspension of disbelief is expected. Consequently, its audience should extend a considerable degree of tolerance. Also, despite the admittedly intriguing premise, true wit is lacking, for which I would instead turn to Rene Clair's 'And Then There Were None;' Howard Hawks' 'The Big Sleep' or to Herbert Ross' 'The Last Of Sheila.'"
2,Yawn,"Great screenwriter, great actors and great dialogue. Even Baldwin did an impressive job in this movie. But it was so boring, I couldn't keep my eyelids open. Very, very, very boring movie. I can't even emphasize it enough how boring it was! Yes, the ending was really cool, but the rest of the movie had me falling asleep. I'd rather see a very entertaining movie with a stinky ending, than a boring movie with a cool ending, any day. A cult movie is a movie with a very high repeatability factor. I wouldn't watch this twice. Maybe just to see the Jaguar at the end, love that car."
1,The most painfully boring movie I've ever seen.,"This is the most painfully boring movie I have ever seen. And I hardly ever get bored, I watch everything from spy movies to documentaries on rodents. A good movie has to give some reason to be interested in what happens, a ""carrot"" to lead the viewer on to the rest of the movie, and The Usual Suspects holds back until the last five minutes. But by then it is an hour and a half too late.The ""suprise"" clincher ending could have saved it, if it had occured after the first 45 minutes. After an hour I started checking my watch wondering when the agony would be over. Watching cars drive by on the highway would have been more entertaining.It probably doesn't help that I saw the last five minutes on TV before I saw the movie."
1,Not Worth the Effort,"Hmmmmm, this movie is so bad that I'm not sure where to start. Surprise ending? Right! I guess all the people who are surprised at the ending don't read much. I think that all of the other reviewers that give this movie high ratings are trying to cover up the fact they are embarassed to admit that they didn't see it coming. The acting is pretty much bottom of the barrel. What's with the guy with the marbles in his mouth? I need subtitles to figure out what he's saying? Is he speaking English? Cinematography, poor, casting, poor, plot, stinks, too long, too boring, no surprise at the end. Other than that, it should be nominated for the Raspberry Award."
1,I did not receive the correct dvd,"I received the incorrect item, however it was inside the correct DVD case.In the DVD case was another DVD. I looked for the title. It was not on the Movie Header. Since the DVD header had the title missing from the introduction, is it an incomplete copy? I did indeed order The Usual Suspects. I had to order from another vendor,the DVD ""The Usual Suspects"" and got it. And it is great.Thank you."
5,Five big friggin' stars me son!,"Yes b'y, dat's right, 5 friggin stars. Dis movie is hawsome. D'actin is friggin great even doh one of dem dere Baldwins is in it. Da story is memorasizin, or sumtin like dat, and da endin...well da endin spun me right round and I landin on me arse. Dint mind doh, cause da movie's so friggin good! Radder watch dis movie den fish; dats how good tis. Tro dis one in your basket"
5,Greta movie,Thsi is one of the great ORIGINAL movies. this is the type of movie when you see it for the first time you want to watch it again to see all the things you missed. Great team of actors and wonderful story.
2,Hard to Follow,"I don't believe that you should have to watch a movie twice in order to ""get it."" A friend recommended I see ""The Usual Suspects"" after enjoying ""The Sixth Sense"" -- when I said that it felt good to be surprised. ""The Ususal Suspects"" fell short of surprising me -- my husband and I were watching for exactly what happened -- and the plot was hard to follow. The sequencing, specifically, made it hard to follow. I think the director was trying too hard to create the climax. It didn't feel natural. I don't get what all the hype was about."
3,"Great movie, but don't buy until they add the extras","A couple of years ago I bought a deluxe DVD of this amazing movie. None of the extras that were included on that DVD are included on the Blu-Ray; in fact, the only extra is a theatrical trailer. I wish that I had waited for a better edition. Anyway, I'll hold on to my DVD."
5,Some People have no balls,"I would be referring to the people who write and give this movie one star, claiming to have figured it out at the start. This is obviously an ego trip, and if it makes you feel better to make us all feel stupid, so be it. The truth is that the movie makes you feel stupid. The fact that you managed to wander over here and review it proves that it got you, or you would have forgotten it. The only thing i've ever felt after seeing a bad movie was a sense of wanting my money back. I certainly didn't get on the internet in hopes of trashing an oscar winning movie. Get a life. The Usual Suspects was da bomb, and it got you too, so deal with it like someone with some balls. Oh, notice how the one star people don't ever leave their e-mail addresses? :)"
5,Stunning Performances and Great Mystery,"This is a twist on the WhoDunIt plot with powerful performances by everyone but Spacey in particular. I love this movie and watch it over and over even though I know the plot and the ending. If you like good mysteries or Spacey movies, definetely get this movie."
5,Number #3 Crime Movie,"Who is Keyser Soze? The one most suspenseful question in this film. This is probably one of the best films ever with an ending that will leave you breathless. The story is about five criminals , Hockney (Kevin Pollack) , McManus (Stephen Baldwin) , Fenster (Benico Del Toro) , Dean Keaton (Gabriel Bryne) , and Verbal Kint (Kevin Spacey) , who are arrested. In prison overnight they decide to commit a crime that will cost most of them their lives. Also starring: Chazz Palminterri , Suzy Amis , Giancarlo Esposito and Dan Hedeya."
5,An absolutely awe-inspiring and satisfying film!,"The Usual Suspects is one of those films that doesn't come around that often. The sheer brilliance of it just pulled me in and right when I thought I had solved the mystery, the plot twisted again. It wasn't just the storyline that was utterly enjoyable, however, but the characters and the script as well. Watching such a serious and complex picture is extremely difficult without some comic relief, and that was provided exceptionally by Del Toro's Fenster and Pollak's Hockney. My favorite element of the entire film, though, was without a doubt, Kevin Spacey. I'm not saying everyone should share my opinion because he is my favorite actor, but to me his performance was absolutely flawless. This is a movie I will watch again and again and never grow tired of."
5,Excellent movie,This movie has the best ending of any movie I have ever seen. It breaks the mold of movies with predictable plots (finally)!

3,Round up the Usual Suspects.,"It's a one shot deal, don't buy this movie, rent it. maybe watch it a second time while keeping an eye out for all the clues, but that is no real way to watch a move. Maybe scene by scene. It was really good, and quite original yet still ultimatly forgettable."
2,"""Plot twist"" for the easily impressed","I'll say something good first: the dialog in this movie is good, and generally well-delivered.The plot, however, is ridiculously contrived.Furthermore, this movie's claim to fame is its ""amazing"" plot twist. I have news for all of you who consider what happens in this movie to be a plot twist:THERE IS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PLOT TWISTS AND NONSEQUITORS.Once the purported ""plot twist"" occurred, the entire movie to that point no longer made any sense whatsoever.In a real plot twist, everything up to the point of the twist is explainable given the twist - you just probably wouldn't have thought of the explanation beforehand. With this ""plot twist"", you have to actively ignore the ""twist"" when thinking about the parts of the movie before it occurred, unless you really don't care that they're no longer sensible."
1,The WORST movie of ALL TIME,My title says it all. How anyone can even find this movie remotely interesting is beyond me. It should be buried in a hole one mile deep in Siberia and forgotten forever. What an absolute FAILURE on all levels!
4,Worth Watching,This was a movie I had never seen until recently stubbling upon it. You will be surprised by what transpires from start to finish. Like actors chosen for main cast but choose Kevin Spacey as most valuable actor in this film.
5,An Unusual Modern Classic,"I must confess, I put off seeing this film for sometime, just because of the title. When someone finally lent me a copy during a spare moment, I reluctantly watched it. Wow! What a great film. To have missed this one would have been such a great loss indeed. It's one on the best films ever made. It's also a film that stays with you. Long after you leave it, the plot twists and ""what ifs"" spin around in your head. And finally if you think about it, you get it. None of it happened. The finest line from the film sums it all up. ""The greatest trick the Devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn't exist."" This is an intelligent movie for people who appreciate a feast, and after, you're left with dessert. It's a game played well. Great fodder for debate. Brilliant.Fine performances from all involved, especially Kevin Spacey, Gabriel Byrne and Director Bryan Singer. Great screenplay by Christopher McQuarrie."
5,I can't even count how many times I've watched this flick...,"It's awesome, pure genius. Not only does it boast a great cast like Gabriel Byrne, Chazz Palminteri, Kevin Spacey, and Kevin Pollak, it's just a fine script with terrific acting. It kept me on the edge of my seat and oddly enough it STILL does. And the music is haunting and eerie..it adds to the movie, perfectly done. Kevin Spacey is without a doubt one of the finest actors EVER to grace the silver screen. His diversity in roles is just amazing. This film couldn't have been done without his acting genius!!"
5,** KEVIN SPACEY IS THE MAN **,"Kevin Spacey won an Oscar for his work in this movie. Everything this man touches turns to gold, as far as I am concerned. This movie is definitely one of the new modern classics ... definitely within the top 50 movies of all times. Worth the price of admission 20 times over! Enjoy."
4,Film Falls Short of Classic Status,"There is much to recommend ""The Usual Suspects"" for. The film is surehandedly directed by first-timer Bryan Singer. The cast is uniformly excellent. The script, that won an Oscar, keeps you guessing until the very end. What I'm not certain of is whether this film meets the status as a modern day classic. It is certainly one of the more ambitious films in recent memory. In my mind, though, it may be a little to slick for it's own good and it wraps things up a little too tidy. That said, this film has a rabid partisan following that is understandable and I recommend this film to those who haven't seen it and let them judge it for themselves."
4,Kevin Spacey Delivers!,"This is the best Kevin Spacey movie yet. This movie will keep you rivited. It slows down a little in the middle, but it has the best ending of any movie yet. If this is the only movie you buy, you won't be disappointed."
5,WHAT IS GOING ON ? OUT OF PRINT ?,"PLEASE , I WAS GOING TO BUY THE DVD EDITION OF THE USUAL SUSPECTS , AND NOW THE MOVIE VANISHES ? CAN ANYONE TELL WHAT'S WRONG ? AMAZON ?"
5,...and then there is one !,"This one ! The Usual Suspects spins a web of intrigue around each sub-plot and unravels all (or does it ?) in the end. A stylish thriller, with gangster overtones that takes you on a journey through characters and a story you will not forget in a long, long time. Watch it without reservation and don't forget to dim the lights when you do..."
5,Made me a fan forever of Kevin Spacey,"Okay Okay although I absolutely LOVED THe Usual Suspects I can understand how a few people may not. These are the types of people who have to always be in control and hate being made a fool of. Howebver even these people must atleast recognive the brilliance and absolute creativeness involved in the film. However I cannot understand at all how some one can say that Kevin Spacey's performance was anything less than Oscar Winning. Just by saying it proves you know nothing about movies and even less about acting! I recommend you see LA Confidential, Seven, The Negotiator and about a dozen others of Kevin Spacey's films. None of his charecters are alike! He really challenges himself on everything he does and makes a success of it all too. If you are a bit hesitant about seeing this movie, trust me it is worht the money and the two hours ( though I'm sure you will wacth it many more times than just once)"
5,Remarkable!,"At the heart of this tidy little thriller is Christopher McQuarrie's Oscar-winning screenplay, which screeches around all sorts of twists and turns, coming to an abrupt (albeit surprising) stop at the end. Crackling with wonderful dialogue and performances, sporting the most perfect ending to a movie I have ever seen, as well as being certainly the most clever, THE USUAL SUSPECTS is, obviously, a *****-star film. So: ""How do you shoot the devil in the back? What if you miss?"""
5,Greatest Movie Ever!,"The only movie I bought on DVD without thinking twice! AMAZING movie! I told my friends that it was the greatest movie I've ever seen, and they didn't believe my praises till they saw it for themselves. They are now complete Usual Suspects fans and bought their own copies! The storyline, the acting, the directing, was simply out of this world! Greatest performance by Kevin Spacie! Beats American Beauty any day! Greatest Ending to a movie EVER! The first time a watched it I saw it 3 times that night! You are guaranteed to see it over and over again! Don't think twice, get the movie NOW!"
5,Spacey at his best,If you are a Kevin Spacey fan and haven't seen this movie you would be in for a treat as far as seeing what a well rounded actor he is by watching it. The movie on a whole is done well and the other actors all do a fine job. The plot is unique and not easy to figure out like many movies. The ending is excellent well thought out. Even if you rent it some where you should see it if you like movies that make you think.
3,A convoluted plot,"""The greatest trick the devil ever played was convincing the world he didn't exist,"" says con man Kint (Kevin Spacey), speaking of the ""heavy"" in the movie, Keyser Soze--whose identity is kept under wraps until the end of the film.Soze is depicted as a criminal mastermind who stays in the shadows, using people at every turn to attain his goals, which themselves lack clarity.Of course, the police force is under his thumb. Does anyone ever make a picture involving police in which they are not corrupt? There must be a reason why the usual fare foisted onto the American theatergoer always, ALWAYS shows our paid public servants (police, FBI, CIA, prison officers, etc.) as worse than the criminals we pay them to catch and keep behind bars.Anyway, this is a convoluted, confusing drama with a lot of explosions, violence and nastiness. Probably a lot of people will enjoy it.Joseph Pierre"
2,"Usual Suspects, Usual Movie, Usual Genre, Etc...","This movie was too confusing to be enjoyable, but that's probably what the director and screenwriter wanted - a film that baffles the viewer and leaves the audience 'guessing' until the end. Bah! In the effort to appeal to the movie-goer by way of ambiguity and mystery, this movie loses its luster. Perhaps if the makers of this film had a goal other than to baffle the viewer, the plot would have been better. Instead, the director concentrated on the audience rather than the film itself. Additionally, while the movie does have a few twists coupled with a surprise ending, it is nothing unique. Like many other films, this one has the same gun play, murder, and ultimate 'bad guy.' This film is nothing special, and I am surprised that so many people found it 'amaxing.' In short, this movie is confusing and the director obviously put too much emphasis on trying to fool the audience. Utterly ridiculous."
2,Load of Cliches,"This movie is just over-the-top Hollywood BS. The writer must think TV is real...he certainly absorbed every mannerism and cliched story line that every cop show and gangster movie ever used, and he strings them all together in a convoluted mush that goes from one supposedly tense moment to another. This is the story of a writer and director trying to outdo other writers and directors who are trying to outdo others in turn. Turn the dial up to eleven. It doesn't have three minutes in it that seem like anything that could ever happen in real life. You're just watching actors act and a parade of standard movie effects. You can all but see the crew standing around in every scene.Who cares? It's like the movie version of a video game. Slick trash, basically."
2,Overrated,"This film is overrated. Very, very overrated. I guessed the ""trick ending"" almost as the movie started. The whole damned film hinges on this ""trick ending"". Bad acting, bad plot, almost incomprehensible dialogue, and a lack of buildup to the twist at the end. We are given clues, but the end has no dramatic ""rightness"". It's just an ending, with no brilliance to it."
1,predictable,"Am I the only one who didn't like this movie. I saw it with my roomate, and we guessed the answer halfway thru the film"
1,so boring i didn't finish it,"when i rented this movie i thought that it would be something that was at least watchable. but it wasn't. i can now honestly say that i fell asleep during a movie. go ahead say this was a terrible review im just writing this to lower it's ratings so somebody doesn't waste their money buying or even renting it before they see it. this movie was boring, stupid, a waste of talent, poor directing, bad storyline, and a pointless plot. if you want to see a good movie see Fight Club or something, don't waste your money or even time on this piece of trash."
1,The Usual Suspects.,"The Usual Suspects movie is a bit obvious from the beginning who Keyser Soze is!(Kevin the communist chavez castro lover spacey)along with Benicio del Toro(Useful tool and che lover) the movie could have been better, I liked Kevin Pollack's performance, Even baldwin's.Chazz is Good. But the Movie isn't Genius. being called some type of Noir. what it is, is UN-Original. Now the movie is not Horrible, But certainly anybody with a brain could have figured out the ending."
5,talk about reinventing the wheel!!!!!!!,"what i mean by this is that this isnt the newest idea.that said,this is an absolutely fantastic,exciting take on the subject.every actor is incredible(yes,even the baldwin guy!)the one who steals the show is mr spacey.but youll have to find out why yourself.like i always say,LEAVE OUT RAPPERS/SINGERS/MODELS and your movie will be 80% better.but i dont think even the curse that is ice-t could have altered my rating for this masterpiece.keyser is the man!!!!!!!!lets start a petition for the return of keyser!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Mildly disappointing,"As a fan of the film, I purchased this disc (again) because of the extra features. In all fairness, the documentary 'featurettes' are interesting. But beware - the deleted scenes are a joke. A couple are about six seconds long. John Ottman's introductions are good, but the scenes are a letdown. Not to mention the fact that they seem to have come from a vhs tape with poor tracking. The gag reel is not funny, and is cut like a public access music video. Further, the 'remastered' image of the feature doesn't look much better than the previous release. Oh well, for 18 bucks, you get what you get."
2,"Junk food: goes down OK, leaves a bitter aftertaste","This is one of those movies whose failure is made worse because it seemed like it was going to be great. The first half of the movie was very entertaining, so you might want to set your alarm and turn it off after an hour. Once you guess who the big bad guy is, most of the interest disappears. Then there's the unfortunate ending that shoots a big hole in the rest of the plot. The ending ruined the movie for me and left me feeling cheated."
2,Worst DVD I own,"As much as I love the movie, the DVD disappoints. No 5.1 Audio, no English subtitles and no anamorphic widescreen. Three things I have come to expect from a DVD release. Let this be a lesson to me to pre-order a DVD w/out checking the technical specs here.Peter"
4,Another on my list of greats..,"Though this movie isn't as good as such films as Pulp Fiction or Goodfellas, it definately sits on the top of my shelf of DVD's. It drags on a little to long, but other than that Kevin Spacey and Benicio Del Toro make the movie great. I don't want to give away the surprise ending, although probably 90% of the country has seen it, so i'll stop there. Definatley will recommend it."
5,Great Movie!,This movie is on my list for one of the best movies ever. I would recommend every get this. Expect your mouth to be dropping at the end. BTW the music is great too.
5,Best movie of all time,"Im so serious when I say best movie of all time. My dad rented this and i watched it not knowing what it was at all. I had planned on falling asleep but found myself up at like 2 on a school night glued to the TV screen. This movie is funny, it has action, is interesting, has great acting and the best ending I have ever seen in any movie, it had me totally surprised at the end, I wasn't expecting it at all. I can not stress enough how important it is that everyone and I mean everyone see this movie."
4,Clever and brilliantly made,"The surprise ending wasn't as surprising as it might have been, but the film is so well written, well plotted, and well put together that it really doesn't matter. Many of the twists along the way were surprising. All in all it's a great movie with some fabulous performances. Although I found Benicio del Toro somewhat annoying as Fenster, the rest were all standouts, especially Kevin Spacey as the crippled and boring Verbal, Gabriel Byrne as the trying to reform Keaton, Chazz Palmintieri as a smart and sympathetic cop, and the underrated Pete Postlethwaite, doing a great accent."
5,Like Nothing You've Ever Seen Before!!!!,"This film is definitely THE best of its kind. Not only because it is a film with a unique story line, brilliant performances, great actors and super suspense, but because it is simply one of a kind! You would have to see the film to completely understand what I mean, but trust me, you absolutely have got to buy this film. The story is sort of difficult to put together and sort of confusing initially, but that is all part of the plan of a devilishly clever storyteller who's going to really, really knock your socks off in right time!! A must-have!"
1,The most overrated movie of the 90s...,"I'll admit, not only did I not guess the plot twist at the end, I thought it was ingenious. That said, this movie was REALLY BORING!!! I hated the characters, the plot was slow, the dialogue awful, and the bickering was way over the top. Personally, I think Kevin Spacey is a great actor, and, for the most part, that's evident here. But, this film is a chore to sit through, and by the time I did get to the end, I didn't care about the characters or the movie. Despite the accolades this movie has received, I suggest renting this film before buying it."
1,Puhleeeze.,"This silly tripe beat ""Braveheart"" for the 'best original screenplay' oscar? Give me a politically correct break."
1,No Big Deal,"A nearly total bore. How can anyone speak of a surprise ending? It should be painfully obvious to anyone with sense enough to devote even a moment's thought to the story. That people are actually astonished by the alleged 'complexity' of this film is a testament to the way audiences have been dumbed down by years and years of mindless drivel. For real complexity, see Scorsese's Raging Bull, or Coppola's Godfather films. The Usual Suspects is like Tinkertoys compared with those works of art."
3,Half clever & rather ridiculous.,"Mr. Super Criminal walks free smoking a cig at the end and we're supposed to think what a winner he is. However, aside from Soze having no friends, some rich people in North Carolina have legally ripped him off and Soze is too dumb to know it.----I mean the cigarettes he buys from the tobacco companies and the heart disease or cancer he probably will get.--The shareholders of Philip Morris Corp.(Altria Corp.) must have laughed their heads off if they watched this."
1,what's the big deal?,"I knew immediately what was going to happen. After I saw through the Big Surprise, I could only sit back and marvel at Kevin Spacey's somnambulistic performance (didn't they have any coffee on that set?). Lots of sound and fury, signifying absolutely nothing.There are much better movies out there. Look a little harder, you'll find one."
4,Can be watched over and over again,"A lot of movies with twist endings have no replay value. With this movie, I always find something interesting that I hadn't noticed the previous viewing."
3,Snoozer,"I had heard for year about what a great movie this was but when I finally got around to watching it I wasn't impressed. Great cast and I liked Kevin Spacey as always, but it literally put me to sleep."
5,One of Kevin Spacey's Finest,"This is the movie that first brought the Great acting of Kevin Spacey to my Attention. This movie is a good ""Thinker"" movie that keeps you guessing. Kevin is great in this movie, and I have to say this is a must see."
5,a NOT so usual film,"When I first began watching this movie, I was captivated. Its detailed plot and fascinating characters made for a remarkably intelligent story. If anyone cannot understand this simple movie, they should be shot. This was a fabulously written and directed movie with excellent actors; it is the one of the best modern classics of our time."
2,My BOO BOO!!,I thought I bought the DVD. Ended up with the authors rendition of this movie. I need to re-order with out all the commentary.Thx.Debbie
2,The Usual Suspects,"I rented this a couple years ago to think it was usually boring. I recently noticed it to be very popular among critics and fans, so I became a fan and saw it at the store ... The movie starts off annoying and slow and stays that way throughtout every now and then putting in not-boring parts to seemingly keep you from leaving the theater. When the end came it was a little cool but I was disappointed, because I felt that was the best and only good part. I really have to know how movies like this and The Godfather and Schindlers List got to be so loved by critics and movie fans. How did they????"
1,The Usual Suspects,"opened the sealed DVD case and Get Shorty was inside and not the Usual Suspects. I sent it back requesting a replacement and did not get a replacement. I got a credit, I think. Not sure. I would rather just have the correct movie."
4,"""Terrific Crime Thriller!""","Kevin Spacey, Gabriel Byrne & more star in Bryan Singer's1995 crime thriller. Five men pull off a successful heistthat brings the attention of an unseen crime figure.This is a terrific film with a great cast. This specialedition has nice picture and sound plus neat extras.Get this."
5,"An explosive, exciting book that's a puzzler until the end","The usual suspects is a great movie. It has great acting by Kevin Spacy, who plays the gymp. The movie itself at the start is quite confusing until the end where it brings it all together. END"
1,Horrible Digitization of a Great Motion Picture,"The fact of the matter is that Bryan Singer and Christopher McQuarrie's USUAL SUSPECTS is one of the best films to come out of the studio system in the last ten years. However, all of their marvelous work is for naught when MGM releases this horrible example of MPEG recording technology. No attention was paid to the cleanliness of the image, thereby creating a picture that looks like I downloaded it off the internet. Newton Thomas Sigel's contrasty neo-noir cinematography is jumbled with ghosts of character's shirts, velour blinds and other mistakes of modern technology. While DVD normally would provide the average cinephile everything they could possibly want, this sad example of the future is annoying and ultimately makes one pine for seeing it projected in a ratty neighborhood theatre. Do yourself a favor - find a widescreen VHS version."
4,Alway on Amazon,"I have found it is the only way to go - should you need the latest CD, video, hard to find vintage works either as a gift or for your own collection there is no easier or faster way then Amazon! Thank you."
3,"Sure, a decent movie, but...","The only reason I give this movie a 3 (and not a 4) is because I expected it to be a much better film. I heard and read good things. I was disappointed. The only thing that saved this movie was Kevin Spacey. I don't know who casted Benicio Del Toro but I really don't like that guy in a 'lively' movie. Without Spacey this movie falls short of even touching my emotions or eliciting any response. And the twist? I hate to say it but I'd have to join the small elite bunch who figured it out early on and didn't have much to watch afterwords. This movie is a good first watch, after that it seems like every other action/thriller with a twist ending but not as thrilling or action packed or dramatic or envoking or ..."
3,"Complex Scheme, w ith Surprise Ending","The Usual Suspects stars Stephen Baldwin, Kevin Spacey, Gabriel Byrne, Benico Del Toro and Kevin Pollak as five small-time criminals that get involved with a strange scheme I found hard to understand. The first scene is a line-up for a trumped up charge and as they wait together a plot is hatched to combine forces.Several crimes are committed successfully, leading up to one big hit for $91 million dollars. Beyond that there is a sub-plot of Keyser Soze, a terrible, secretive, underworld killer gang leader that no one can prove is real, other than stories of his cold, horrendous temper and killing binges.Because some of the dialogue is not easily understood, it was hard to keep an interest in most of the movie. The final thirty minutes make the Usual Suspects worth watching, strange yet fascinating surprise ending."
4,The usual 90's movie.,"I feel like they swore so much more in the mid-90's. Maybe I'm just getting old but every other line of this movie was f*ck, it seemed. So that kind of turned me off of the movie. However, on the hole this movie was good, good action, good plot and good mystery. Kevin Spacey did a great job with his role, it was a lot like his role in Seven. Kind of the relaxed sociopath with sarcastic humor.On Blue ray-HD the movie looked great, I watched it on a PS3 while sick one afternoon and it took my mind off of the stomach flu. And if thats not a great movie I don't know what is."
5,One of the best movies made,When I first saw this movie I was caught up in an interesting story and that alone makes it worth your time. When you get to the end of the movie it makes you glad that you spent the time watching it. It has one of the most unforgettable endings of all time. Definately one for your DVD collection. I love Kevin Spacey and Chaz Palminteri and they make this movie better with their acting. I have seen parts of this movie copied and used in others so you know it has made its mark.
4,What the ?,At the start this movie seems no more than a story about a group of thugs out to make big money. But when it is revealed that they have been brought together by a higher criminal it goes from confusion to amazement when the crime boss who brought the characters together reveals to be one of them and the least one to be expected.
4,Kevin Spacey makes the movie,"While the movie is great and a definite must-see it is Kevin Spacey's performance as the invalid narrator that makes this movie a true classic. He is simply incredible, yet also very believable. without him the ending would never have worked so well. You have to see this movie, even if only for Kevin Spacey (he won't let you down)."
5,The Usual Suspects DVD,"The Usual Suspects is an amazing, action-packed psychological drama/thriller type movie that will definately leave you guessing till the end! Amazing direction by Bryan Singer, great script with an OUTSTANDING ensemble cast including the amazingly talented Gabriel Byrne (the sexiest man alive), the brilliant Kevin Spacey and Kevin Pollack, possibly the most hilarious man alive. The DVD offers great features such as a number of cast and crew interviews, featurettes, and a gag roll, and lots of behind the scenes footage and deleted scenes. Not too mention, i find that the visuals of the DVD are FAR better than any VHS, it's a lot brighter and easier to see everything. All in all, this is a great, great cult classic for any movie freak. If you haven't seen this, you aren't a movie fanatic!!!"
5,An All-Around Incredible Film,"Wow!...That was my feeling after the first viewing of ""The Usual Suspects"". The entire movie is non-stop action. Between all the bomb explosions, interigation scenes, and intense situations lies a great plot. Then comes the end of the movie. The point where this goes from being a four star action film to one of the best movies i have ever seen. If you don't know what I'm talking about then you must see this film. It's definitely not your usual movie."
5,ONE OF THE GREATEST MIND PUZZLERS OF ALL TIME!!,"An incredible achievement for Brian Singer. An extraordinary film that keeps you guessing all the way to the end. The climax comes near the end of the movie with an ingenious surprise. The flashbacks are suspenseful gripping your mind making you rethink your own instincts when the film is over. The film demostrates how people stereotype charecteristics in others and how we can be wrong on our own judgements. Pay very close attention to names in this movie or you are going to lose track of what is going on. Kevin Spacey recieved a well deserved Oscar for his supporting role and because of this movie, I rent other movies with him in it. Destined to be a classic or in the hall of fame of films. Very similar style to Stephen King. A MUST SEE FOR ANYONE WHO HAS NOT SEEN IT!! A collectors item if you have it on DVD or VHS."
5,Can he act or what??,"This movie blew me away. I never expected it to be anything good, and a ""friend"" of mine had spoiled the ending anyway. But I was still shocked and amazed by the twist at the end. (The word 'twist' seems an understatement) Congrats to the writer for making an original and fresh script come to life. But the full congrats, and round of applause goes to Kevin Spacey - a phenomenal actor in a phenomenal role. Every sideways glance, every twitch of his face, every almost imperceptible smirk belonged to Verbal, and I never once looked on him as anything but. One of the greatest performances I have ever seen, in one of my favourite movies of all time. See It!"
1,very sad,"you can tell that the show in dubling was great, exciting and beautiful, and you wished you were there, but watching this video just makes you wanna talk to those who made it. you want to see it so much....and you cant!!!!!!the only thing you see is the camera changing constantly and some feets....you dont see the beautiful dance and the whole experience from watching this dvd is DISAPOINTING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!if you like the irish dance this dvd is unuseful......it is horrible and makes you very mad because you want to see it so much and can't and can't do anything about it either!!!!!dont buy it, waste of money and energy!"
2,I love to dance,I'm writing this for my seven year old grandaughter --she loves this DVD- she twirls and bounces and dances all the way thru it -- it transports her to an imaginary stage where she is the star-- I love watching her enjoy this dvd!!!
2,Lord Of The Dance,Very poor picture quality. Show taped in Ireland ..would have liked to see a recording from US
1,Lord of the Prance.,"The first show ""Riverdance"" was much, much better.""Lord of the Dance"" is just success gone crass...way too much in the way of blinding glitz.Even Seigfried and Roy would be aghast.There are too many egotistical close ups of himself grinning into the camera and not enough of the other fine dancers in the show.The first ""Riverdance"" show was much, much better."
3,Mucho zapateo y música monotona,"Probablemente desde el punto de vista musical y técnico, esta es una obra de cinco estrellas, pues la ejecución de los bailarines es perfecta. Sin embargo, a mi me aburrió, pues encontré mucho zapateo, la musica no relacionada entre si y monotona. Algunos temas son buenos, pero dentro de los 90 minutos, son pocos momentos buenos. La escenografía es pobre."
2,"Great show, terrible video","Lord of the Dance is a great show to see in person. It's flashier (and I guess sexier) than Riverdance, which makes it different, not better or worse. But you'll never know from the video. The switches between angles are much too quick, and the view is alternately murky with ""smoke"" and washed out by light. Perhaps this is a fine example of the vieographer's art, and if you want to appreciate that, fine. But don't buy this video if you want to see Lord of the Dance."
1,video quality very poor,"Dancing is wonderful, but is flawed by the poor video transfer. It has the look of a eight mm film."
5,mostly happy,"I was pleased with the item. I was pleased with the delivery time. I was not pleased with the lack of protective packaging. Since the disk was loose in its case, the lack of cushioning packing could have resulted in a damaged item."
2,"Lord of the Dance: Performance=4, film-making=0.","What a disappointment! There's fantastic talent and effort here, but it is thoroughly painful to watch, due to the film-making.The constant, rapid shifting of camera angles, including up through the glass floor, combined with the switches to slow-motion video, make the effort to enjoy the tempo and flow of the show effectively impossible. Further, the VHS version alternated between poor lighting and oversaturation of color. Too bad. The performance is high-energy and creative, although without the ""heart"" of Riverdance. It's a fair-to-poor 90-minute encouragement to see the stage show, if it is ever performed again. That's about it."
3,"Great content, poor production",Michael Flatley works great on his show. He moves you to another world with his dancing. But this DVD lacks quality. It could just be better than it is. For moments the sound (wich should be perfect) gets unclean and so ocurrs with the image. So you will enjoy this DVD once you become familiar with the idea that it is less than perfect on some aspects. If you're a demanding user of DVD you will be somehow disapointed.
3,"Exciting show, but filming is blurry on my HD TV","Michael Flatley never fails to impress; this show is similar to ""Feet of Flames"" which is actually much better onscreen; but whomever filmed this one seemed inexperienced with capturing the lighting properly so that the action onstage is nice and clear. The disc itself was fine; but the amateurish quality of the camera work regarding the lighting made it hard to see the dancers defined at all. A better purchase would be ""Feet of Flames"" also by Michael Flatley, which is superb in every way."
1,Lord of the Egotists,"As a fan of Riverdance, I was excited to get ""Lord of the Dance"" which I had heard many good things about. But, my gosh, what a disappointment!My first thought was, ""Weird.""The costumes, the songs, everything about it was just plain strange. And then in swaggers Michael Flatley--Lord of the dance, the hero, with feet of flames! Humbug. He'd better watch out, he might burn himself.And then I watched Riverdance again. I began to notice just how big his ego was, even then. Now, after seeing it several times, I can't stand it! He strikes the most ridiculous poses, in Riverdance, AND in Lord of the Dance. It's simply nauseating.Michael Flatley may be just about the greatest dancer, but he knows it. That's the whole problem.So, if you're a fan of Riverdance, don't think that because you love that, you're going to love this. ""Lord of the Dance"" is a waste of time and money."
3,"Good show, lousy video","The dancing is good, and the music, as much as one can hear it over noise from the audience is good. However, the video production I found to be lacking. Sound is, as I have indicated, poorly balanced. When bright lights are on the dancers, the contrast goes out the window.I'd buy Riverdance. Just as good a show, superior video."
2,Dissapointing,"I don't like Flatley. I never have. Not since he thought he was too good for RiverDance anyway. Would you believe that he wanted RiverDance to be actually called ""Michael Flatley's RiverDance""? I didn't at first. But after seeing his dance techniques on the video, I firmly believe that he is nothing but a show off. I mean, would you get up on stage in front of the world half naked?The dancing was very good and so was the music."
1,audio quality,The quality of the audio on this DVD is horrable. The VHS version has sound and volume quality 10 times greater then this DVD.
1,An insult to Irish dance and tradition,"This... was... terrible. The camera angles were awful, you never really get to see the dancing, and I am sorry, but I think that there are better Irish dancers than Michael Flatley. His ego overwhelms his dancing talent. This movie isn't about Irish dancing, it's about a fantasy in Flatley's mind. I'll stick with Riverdance, thanks."
3,Good,"My mom bought this. It came pretty quickly, and works well. No damage to the discs, and for a fan, it's perfect."
3,Good seller,"I was pleased with the seller. The shipment was prompt. I wasn't so happy with the actual product. It was new, in the package but the quality of the CD was not real good. It could be that it is an older product and they did not have the higher quality they now have but it could have been remastered."
5,Michael Flatley - Lord of the Dance (1997),Tres bon DVD ( Michael Flatley - Lord of the Dance (1997))J'aime beaucoup ces danses
5,Michael Flatley rocks!,You can't beat his talent...when the whole Riverdance fever took the world over a decade ago I tired of his stardom. However watching him in Lord if the Dance reminded me of his superb talent. It truly is an amazing show to watch and well worth every penny
4,A Celtic Dream,"After seeing Lord of the Dance live in Indianapolis, I had to get the video, because I was amazed with the show. After viewing the video, I believe that the best experience you could have, is to see it live. Because the video quality is only a fraction of what it is live. The images cut every few seconds, which can be somewhat distracting, and sometimes, the lighting in the video can be too much, and makes the entire screen look fuzzy blue. But, if you are an avid Lord of the Dance fan, I suggest buying this video, especially since Michael Flately is not preforming this show anymore."
5,Dance~tacular,I seen The LORD OF THE DANCE in person- The dance performances and music are verbally undescribale! It is a WONDERFUL production that renews the mind & soul!
1,5 Stars for Michael but...,"This rating is not for Michael Flatley, his crew or his fantastic show. But I think Mike should sue the DVD production company for ruining such a magnificient show. Whoever edited the disc was not even an amateur; He must be both deaf and blind. No audio video synchronisation even in the grand finale. Doesn't worth buying."
4,Flying Feet,"Michael Flatley leaves his original ""home"" with the Riverdance Troupe to deliver what is in essence a ballet-drama in this performance video. Although the story he tries to tell seems a bit murky at times, the dancing makes up for it. Definitely a keeper."
5,Heart pounding!!!,"I was first turned on to Lord of the Dance when it was shown on PBS for their telethon fund raising promotion...NOW, I have the video, I have the CD, I've seen the show in person and am going to see it again next month!!!! Even my husband and 4 year old son can't help themselves from tapping their feet and humming to the music. You won't be disappointed!!"
1,Phenomenal Show Destroyed by Disruptive Filming,The utter incompetance of the director totally destroys a wonderful performance. Constant angle changes and camera motion make it impossible to get a feel for the show. The motion of the camera is so disruptive and irritating that this film is nearly impossible to sit through. It is a complete shame that the pathetic filming ruins a stunning show.
2,Too much camera movement spoiled the show,"I am a fan of Michael Flatley and I have seen the Riverdance video but this one is badly made. The show itself is good but the video quality is misty and camera angle changes every 10 sec. I would recommend people to buy Feet of Flames video instead. It is practically the same show only newer and better. It has everything that LotD offer but with more dancers and the dancers dance more maturely too. Trust me, save your money to buy FoF instead."
1,There MUST be 2 releases,"I saw Lord of the Dance on PBS a few years ago and was astounded. I had hoped I was buying a recording of that spectacular event, but unfortunately the tape I received was something substancially different. It is quite simply incomprehesible that anyone would deem what I received an acceptable video presentation of anything, let alone Michael Flatley's venerable dance masterwork.Far beyond a matter of ""taste"", the video quality was substandard in every way; it's quality is more likened to that of a 15th generation bootleg.I've recovered from viewing the tape, and I can only conclude that there are 2 distinctly different releases of this title being sold in the same packaging. This is the only explaination I can fathom for the massive gap in opinion found in the Amazon reviews. Unless, of course, all of the positive reviewers were somehow involved in the production of this item...I would suggest that you RENT a copy =before= you purchase."
4,"bad, bad camera work",I loved LOrd of the Dance. I agree that the camera work and editing left a lot to be desired-it looks rather amaterish but the dancing makes up for it. The dancers are terrific and I wish the camera had focused more on the dancing than on Michael Flatley and his torso. I agree that the live performance is better by far but I don't think that anybody connected with the show thought that it would have the impact that it did-so they probably did't get top notch camera men-but its still worth having and worth seeing-more than once. I have both the DVD and the video and won't loan it out to anybody.
3,Lord of the Dance,"Got the title last weekend and couldn't wait to watch it. But it turned out to be somewhat of a disappointment. The lighting was very poor, and so was the camera movement. I have to deduct 2 stars. In addition, they used Dolby Digital 2.0 instead of 5.1 coding. It seems to me that they were in a hurry to make a few bucks. Just my personal opinion, no point deduction. If you like this dance, you might still want to buy it since this is the only DVD around. But I surely hope that a better version can be produced soon. Just my 2 cents."
2,Poor Video Quality,"The dancing and music were great, but the quality of the video was terrible. It looked like a tape of a tape. I felt as if I were trying to see the dancers through a cloud or mist."
3,One man show,"The video is really good, but Riverdance still outdoes this one. Michael Flatley is the only star of the show, outdancing even the other important characters. In most instances, the camera is zoomed to the ""lord's"" face and feet, so you actually see very little of the other dancers. He probably thinks he can do the show without the back-ups. The music is cool though."
2,atrocious audio and video,"The show itself is entertaining. It's no Riverdance, however. Despite his fabulous violin soloists, Mr. Flatley offers taped music while his adversary offers a complete orchestra as well as dancers. The audio is downright atrocious. The final mix sounds like an illegal bootleg, and the video is hazy."
2,A sad disappointment,"A travesty of Michael Flatley's earlier work in Riverdance, this soulless production is unworthy of the rare talents of Flatley and the other performers. The skillful dance is all but obliterated by flashing lights, smoke, and chaotic camera switches. Endless slow motion shots insult the dancers and the audience. The ""story line"" is phoney and gratuitous. Flatley makes a spectacle of himself, wandering away from the group in mid-dance to fondle and kiss the leading female dancer, casting himself in ridiculously self-aggrandizing poses, and whipping up the screaming live audience by shouting back at them, ""Yes ... yes!"" It's a sad thing to see Irish music and dance profaned by one of the very artists who brought them to the rest of the world."
2,"I agree, shoot the editor !","I agree with some other reviews. The performances are incredible, and Mr. Flatley is amazing. But the show falls flat on its face with editing seemingly done by a 2 year old. Switching every 2 seconds from camera to camera, and interspersing with slow-motion at the wrong times makes it impossible to enjoy the immense talent these performers have. Seeing this show in person in October 2005 at a small venue was outstanding, even without Mr. Flatley. Up close and personal, something this DVD totally lacks due to the poor editing."
4,Fast paced Irish dancing. A must see for ALL!!!,Great Action adventure ... and no guns needed! An excellent cinematographic version of a broadway great.
3,"great dancing, yet should have partial nudity rating","We loved the dancing its self, yet we would have liked to be warned about the nudity. We watched most of it before showing it to our entire family, to make sure it was suitable. We thought they would really like it. About 3/4 through the concert, the girls tore off their dresses and were left with just their bra and underwear on. That will teach us to view the entire film before showing it to our family."
5,Lord of the Dance,We always enjoy Michael Flatley and Riverdance in any form. Being able to watch it when I want instead of waiting till it comes back on TV is really great.
2,Definitely not their best.........YUK!!!,"This is definitely NOT the best from this brilliant group.Infact it's an insult compared to their other albums. But stilli managed to find a few grooves that i can get into,for instance,""Inside To Outside"" has a nice feel and ""Blue Sky"" is a nicespacey laidback jam. The rest sounds like disco. I truly hopethat this is not a sign of things to come from Matt Cooper andfriends. To get a feel of Outside's best,check out ""Almost In""This is their debut recording and in my opinion,their best workto date,followed by ""The Rough and The Smooth"" Each and everycut on both of these cd's is GREAT! ""Discoveries"" is the perfect experimental soundtrack for a movie.They all have a jazzy oldschool feel with great keyboards throughout. Hopefully they willget it back together again."
2,The Downward Slide Outside,"I can remember first hearing Matt Cooper, teamed with Cleaveland ""Origin"" Watkiss, on Outside's debut ""Almost In"". It was the CD that I used to [anger] my wife because I literally played it to death. Ditto for ""The Rough and the Smooth"". Since then, I've been a jilted (music) lover, waiting for another Outside CD to knock me out like those. That CD never came. But total disappointment in Matt Cooper's musical genius did.I'm not even sure if Outside is still a band, with Matt Cooper teaming up with Andreas ""something-or-other"" for a series of wannabe-eclectic tracks that sacrifice electronic raw grooves for experimental 'edge'. More like 'sledge'. ""Blue Sky"" is the ONLY track on Out of the Dark worth listening to. Too bad there was no single available.Hopefully, that old Outside mystique will come back to bless those of us tired of commercial radio schlock. Hopefully, Outside will come back 'in' again."
4,"Exciting, intriguing, under-rated film!","Has excellent acting by James Woods as well as supporting cast. Intriguing, multi-faceted plot keeps you on edge, with a variety of memorable depictions of shady characters. Includes a few highly sexy scenes. This film deserves to be seen more; certainly a must-see for Woods fans. I cannot understand why it is not available on DVD."
5,One Of James Wood's Best Performances,"I agree with the previous reviewers comments. Having been a favorite from years ago in VHS format. If ever there was a case to be made for a remaster to DVD,this would be at the top of the list. A super good view,fast action paced film. Highly recommended!"
2,Virtual Beauties 2020: The Ultimate 3d Graphic Collection,"Unimpressive. They just aren't beautiful, nor realistic. Sure the cover girl is gorgeous but that's it. If this is what passes for beauty in Japan... well I can find many many more beautiful and near photo realistic 3D graphic program generated beauties all over the internet. 2 stars for the cover girl. 1 star for the rest. Rip off."
2,"I like it, but my children don't :|",I love this product but I have a hard time with my children taking it because they don't like the taste. I did find that if you mix it with a little bit of juice they will drink it but they still complaint about the taste. It is so much trouble that I probably will not purchase it again. :\
5,Excellent product,I needed an Omega 3 product that would have the most benefit for my children without giving them extra sugar.. i found this product and love it! They get way more Omega fatty acids compared to the gummy versions you can buy. My children have taken this supplement for 5+ years.I do use a syring to give it to them. They won't drink it out of a small medicine cup.. too oily!! lol
2,5 stars? Really?,"I can't believe how many 5 star reviews this product got. I can get my son to take it (I have to coax him to do it), but he does not care for the taste. I am currently looking for a different product that has a taste that appeals to him."
4,Definitely in a class almost of its own,"Big points on the diversity of tracks here. There's a David Holmes-y love of music in all forms that makes it something special. I wouldn't agree with the previous review that all of the tracks flow together as well as they could, but it's also not the biggest deal in the world. If you're looking for something interesting, this is it. If you're looking for a sure-fire dance mix at any party, it might not be. Only those who like a little Traffic and Mary J. Blige with their leftfield and downtempo need apply."
1,Disgusting,"These are horrible. Horrible.Usually I can eat the snacks that my child rejects and if I can't stand them, the next-door neighbor's kids will demolish anything edible. These are sitting in my pantry after being tried by about 4 different families with a total of about 8 children and none of them wanted the leftovers to take home. The adults all grimace as soon as they eat them and I hate wasting food, but it's worth it just to see the expression on their faces. Hopefully I can give them away at the next food drive to someone who may want them, because our family couldn't stand the texture or the taste."
3,Not very much blueberry flavor,"I'm glad this is organic. That's nice, but the flavor is pretty boring. I don't think it tastes much like blueberries. My kids will eat it, but I think we will stick with the Amy's fruit gummy bunnies- which have a lot more flavor. For the price, I felt I didn't get much with these."
4,tasty,This is pretty good - a tasty and convenient snack. But it's not really blueberry. It's mostly apple - flavored with a little blueberry.
3,"Accomplished singing, but no useful notes.","The disk -- focused on Christmas music -- includes both chant and polyphony so it is not strictly ""Gregorian."" As a recording by one of the most renowned ensembles for the interpretation of chant it is available at a ludicrously low price. The singing is accomplished, but there are no useful notes or texts."
5,AUSSIES ROCKED TO HEADPINS TOO !,"IF ANYONE HAS ABSOLUTELY ANYTHING ON HEADPINS I NEED TO KNOW. I AM ORIGINALLY FROM SYDNEY,AUSTRALIA BUT NOW LIVE IN ENGLAND. I WORK IN MUSIC RADIO AND ARE DESPERATE TO GET MORE INFO ON THE 80'S BEST ROCK OUTFIT. IN 1984 I MANAGED TO GET HOLD OF A COPY OF ""LINE OF FIRE"", IN FACT I GOT 2 COPIES, ONE IS WITH ME NOW THE OTHER IS UNTOUCHED AND LIVING AT MY MUM'S PLACE BACK IN SYDNEY. ABOUT A YEAR AGO I MET A GUY WHO HAD A COPY OF ""HEAD OVER HEELS"", STUPIDLY HE LENT IT TO ME (LIKE HELL I'M GIVING IT BACK). BOTH ALBUMS ARE GREATLY CHERISHED AND GO EVERYWHERE WITH ME. I REMEMBER A TRIBUTE SHOW AND/OR A CONCERT BEING SHOWN ON U.K. TV AFTER THE PASSING OF BRIAN MacLEOD SHOWING FOOTAGE OF THEM PERFORMING LIVE. NO ONE SEEMS TO WHAT THE SHOW WAS SO IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO TRACE.I'VE NEVER SEEN THEM LIVE AND SADLY NEVER WILL. IF YOU CAN HELP PLEASE GIVE ME A SHOUT. CHEERS ANDY"
2,headpins,"Some people out there have shown interest in the band Headpins. I particularly remember an Aussie now living in England named Andy that was looking for particular information on Headpins. It might also intesrest him that i have the album ""turn it loud"" here, that i believe is missing from his collection. I unfortunately cannot get a hold of him since no e mail address has been forwarded. So Andy if you're out there, let me know what your address is. The anthology is poor because it holds no songs from their first and best album ""turn it loud""."
4,This is a completely rockin' album.,I had this album as a tape for years. I always used it to test new speakers and other new stereo components. It totally kicked butt and then I lent it out and its gone. Haven't been able to find it since anywhere. If anyone knows where to get a CD copy please write !!!
3,Where did that one go? Wow....the Headpins..cool!,"I can't find it, I don't have it anymore, I sometimes forget their name. What is it about this album(yes I said ""album"")that I can't get it out of my head. ""Feel My Body"" was like some Jr High anthem of mine, thinking I was ""all that"". I remember rumors about the lead singer being a silver medalist for the Canadian Olympic Ice Skating Team. I was really into this band knowing nothing about them. I've never seem them live. I gave the cassette to a girl in the mid- eighties somewhere and I don't think she truly appreciated what I was sharing with her. <g> I wish I could find a copy somewhere just to prove to my wife they exist. The album was a great listen all the way through from what I remember. I think today the music would really find a nice quiet niche and rock slowly and steadily. That's probably what they had in mind anyway."
3,Allerpet C -- lousy ad,"The product is OK, but the Amazon page does not give the quantity of the bottle, 12oz or 16oz. You can get it cheaper elsewhere if this is the 12oz."
4,DEEP AND POIGNANT READING,Jim Savio is a excellent writer who should get more recognition. If you would like to add to your short story collections. You should definately have THE FAIRY FLAG. I hope to read more from this author in the future.
1,I'D LIKE TO GIVE THIS A 5 BUT.... i NVR RECIEED THE ORDER,"I really enjoy john sykes, and i wan this album....thats why i ordered it a month agi..... it still hasn't arrived. My account says it was deliverd but i dont have it -- the help option is utterky useless, so i ve resorted to this, bad mouthing the album i want just becasue its the only way i can get some help... maybe. Any way, im sure this alubum is great if casutionary warning is any indication... it is a truley rocking song! hope ytou have better luck than me getting it though"
2,Not quite what I expected,"I was a little surprised to receive a book marked ""discard"" and the public library that discarded the book. I guess in this case I actually got what I paid for."
3,Informative and enjoyable,"It has been some time since I read this book. It was mostly about the raising of this special breed of bull, how they are selected and what they are exposed to. The ranches who raise them take great pride in their finished product. If my memory serves me correctly, I read the book after seeing the movie, The Sun Also Rises. If you like bullfighting and all aspects of it, you will like this book."
5,"I love, I love, I love...","I soooo love these boots.. the colour is great, different than any I ever had. They are also so very comfortable, even the first time I wore them. the leather did not need time to break like other boots. I love them, the colour, the feel and the height is just right!!"
3,"Poetic, fascinating horror film","I think that this is Val Lewton's second best horror film, the first being The Body Snatcher. Director Jacques Tourneur does a fine turn here and the acting is better than it was in Cat People which loses a lot on the small screen. The walk through the cane fields towards the voodoo ridden home fort is extremely impressive. The life in death theme which occupies so much of this film and Lewton's Seventh Victim is powerfully realized."
4,Chamber Pop,"A Great little pop record that has snuck out of a burgeoning Philly scene. Bea-utiful, restained passionate pop song, all framed by conscise cello and violin. I don't want to make those dreaded comparisons, but I can tell you their classic song, ""Measure"" ended up on a mix tape between some old XTC and some new Belle and Sebastian, and sounded quite at home."
5,The more whimsical world of Carmen Miranda!,"What the above listing DOESN'T tell you about this Particular Carmen Miranda collection is really how much fun this assortment of tunes is compared to ones containing nothing but her more serious native recordings. Sure you do have a few of those here - ""Diz Que Tem"", ""Arca De Noe"" and ""Nao Te Dou A Chupeta"" with her famous ""Bando da Lua"" which are great too. Also her ""Americanized"" recordings from some of her movies - even the post WWII bombs - she's still a hot pepper, but the movies are often exercises in splashy tedium. But the best and most whimsical of all on this are the pairings she did with the wonderful Andrews Sisters - ""Cuanto La Gusta"", ""I See, I See"", ""The Wedding Samba"" and one of the versions of ""The Matador"". If you purchase this for nothing else it would be those novelties! Overall a long-time favorite of mine in my whole Carmen Miranda collection of music!"
2,i thought itd be 'better than this',"this is definately not what i expected from onelinedrawing, im very dissapointed, this is not good, i shouldve listened to the samples before buying, do that and youll see what im talking about"
4,Great Philosophical Work,Great work by one of the greatest and controversial philosophical and philological minds in history. Difficult to really grasp without a supplemental reader but valuable piece for any philosophy collection.
5,Wonderful book,"Wonderful book, although Nietzche was as naive as hell. He understood everything about how to write a book but didn't understand his subject: Humans. Humans tend naturally to evil (Sorry :-( ) He intended for man to better himself but how? Have you ever read ""Notes from Underground"" written by Dostoyevski? That's the real human being driven by his own base instincts!For those of you who equal this book to Hitler and his nazis you are wrong! Nietzche intended a superhuman endowed with celestial qualities not a bunch of thugs and murderes as Hitler and his ""friends"" were. He, I'm certain, would be horrorized by what the nazis did and interpret and to what use they put his famous work. In my humble opinion, Nietzche didnñt live long enough to understand how vile humans can be."
1,outdated translation,"This translation is quite old (now public domain) and riddled with substantial errors. Have a look at the Kaufmann translation instead and spend a few extra bucks -- the book will make far more sense if you do! More enjoyable, too..."
3,Worth digging through the lofty language,"This edition has a useful preface written by the translator, explaining why he thinks it is superior to prior transaltions from the German. His interspersed explanations throughout the book were informative. Nietzche, of course, gives the reader more than he/she can handle. Even if you don't understand all his allegories and ideas, there are enough gems in here that anyone can enjoy. I suspect that a second reading would be even more rewarding."
3,Worth Reading,"Nietzsche has been said to be one of the greatest influances on modern philosophy, especially the existentialist movement and Zarathustra shows the reader just why he was a large influance. Nietzsche's works are truly like no ohter writer's, however, his philosophy seemed to be ignorant and sexist at times to myself, but none the less I do feel that everyone should read some of Nietzsche's works (or any philosopher's works for that matter). I do enjoy Nietzsche's argument against modern Christianity and the herd mentaility of the masses, but I think those two things would have to be my favorite philosophical views of Nietzsche. I give this book and Nietzsche in general, three stars because, while he will be an influance and is a good read, his philosophy is not the greatest at many points and is often misunderstood by people."
3,There are things here.,There are some things here. I like this book and found it interesting. This book says alot about solitude and many other things. This book has the rare ability to console and can even act as a friend when there is no friend. This book may allude to making solitude tolerable.
3,All Kindle versions are same!!,"There are many Kindle versions of Thus Spake Zarathustra and they ARE ALL THE SAME, from Project Gutenberg. Only one translation is therefore represented (the Common one). Don't pay for it, get it for free from Project Gutenberg"
3,good for what it is....,"first: there is no info on what translation they used for this audio book!ALSO- BE FOREWARNED THAT THIS IS AN ABRIDGED VERSION! there is no explanation of what they left out or why in the notes.i give it 3 stars only for how good it was read. the reader does an excellent job, and the ""intro narration"" is kept to a minimum. if only they had included all the text!!!!"
5,Rereadable,"This is a new gospell, as Nietzsche himself described it. Truth is only a few can read the book, but reading it again is always a possibility and each time it will be different. Nietzsche is in fac one of the greatest philosophers, the price of this book is an insult for its real value, well worth it."
2,Talk About Philosophical!,"After trying to put in an honest effort to read this book, I just gave up. The superman stuff and the level of philosophy was too much for me."
4,Persuasive but fundamentally flawed,"Nietzsche's tale of the prophet Zarathustra and his teachings is a persuasive story. Nietzsche does a remarkable job of presenting many compelling ideas through the words of his prophet Zarathustra: the problem is that atheism is not a base on which any completly rational base can be built. For instance, Razi Zacharias's book, Can Man Live Without God? presents a powerful counter-arguement to Nietzsche's ideas, while it is not centered on Nietzsche so much as Nietzsche's basic philosophy of atheism."
5,Pregnant With Ideas,"This is cleary a work of passion from a philosopher who said ""yes"" to life. What a wealth of ideas Nietzsche presents, from a man with an excessively intense mind. Philosophical, poetic, psychological, and sociological all juxposized into a amazing free flowing work of fiction from a philosopher and self proclaimed psychologist. Nietzsche had a torn yet brilliant mind, due to his excessive solitude and health problems.I have read this book three times and I never read a book more then once. One must read this book several times because all the ideas and insights crammed into such a short book. TSZ is Nietzsche at his best."
2,Archaic language destroys a masterpiece.,"T.S.Z. is easily one of Nietzsche's best books, and probably one of THE best books ever written, which can easily be gleaned from Kaufmann's and Hollingdale's translations, but this translation doesn't do the book any justice at all. It can be utterly unreadable at times, mostly unreadable the rest of the time. Obviously Common was trying to use the language of the King James Bible; language which was considered out-dated and archaic even when that book came out. But the language admittedly does have a certain force and power to it. Ludovici's afterward at the end can be a good read, as it does show certain ideas, such as the chapter ""Young and Old Women"", in a new light, and offers interesting interpretations. But besides that, you'd do best simply getting a different version.Let me just put it this way: if I had paid more than two dollars for this book, I would have felt ripped off."
1,Terrible Translation,"I got this version and the german version together at the same time. While reading the ""english"" version I came across absolute nonsense. Several times I had to look back on the german text to figure out what was going on. This is one of the worst translations I have seen. Several parts are incomprehensible or completely miss the point of the original text. Go out and buy a better version. This work is too important to be wasted on poor english."
2,Warning---not formatted correctly for Kindle.,"True, it was only $0.99, but it's principle at work here. I now know the value of previewing the book before buying. Don't assume the book is formatted correctly for the Kindle because it's in the Kindle book store. I don't know about the other versions of the book offered, but this specific one (Thus Spake Zarathustra - A Book For All And None) was entirely left-aligned (incorrectly, so that you'd have one whole line of text always followed by a half line, every two lines looked like the end of a paragraph) and had an unlinked TOC, making it a chore to simply get through the intro.Two'd because the content is classic, but the delivery is broken."
5,comprehensible,I have not done reading through but I could understand this version of translation at least compare to another oneI had long time ago.
2,Spelling/grammar errors,"This is not a critique of Nietzche, but of the publisher. This edition had too many spelling and grammatical errors for a work of this caliber."
4,"Too much thee, thou, doeth for my taste","Ah, heck. Call me uncouth or whatever, but reading these 150 year old philosophy works can often be taxing on a today-man like myself. Honestly, I wasn't ready for the thee, thou... Anyway, sorry I tarnisheth a worketh such as thiseth. My bad. Otherwise, love Nietzsche so far. I've only read two books of his, and I guess I'm surprised by how far ahead of his time he was on religious matters. Philosophy with a hammer, indeed."
5,Brilliant despite the flaws,"Zarathustra is a fascinating piece of art, best read as poetry rather than philsophy. I agree with Ayn Rand's comment on Nietzsche in her preface to her great novel ""The Fountainhead"" : ""as a poet, he projects at times (not consistently)a magnificent feeling for man's greatness, expressed in emotional, not intellectual terms.""Nietzsche, in Zarathustra, looked at Man's acceptance of Christianity, Statism, Collectivism, and Self-sacrifice, gave Man a slap, and laughed at him. Then he begged Man to overcome his faults and reach his highest potential."
5,Nietzsche is my messiah,Nietzsche is the messiah of the modern philosophical eon. Nietzsche looks god in the eyes and says you are dead! and god falls to his knees...
3,Warehouse Of Doom...,"THE BETRAYED is a rather long-winded ""thriller"" w/ few actual thrills. Melissa George (TURISTAS, TRIANGLE) is adequate in her role as Jamie Taylor, a woman who wakes up on the cold floor of a warehouse, wondering why she's there. About 99.98% of the ""action"" takes place in one small-ish room in the supposedly vast building. Oded Fehr (yeah, the MUMMY guy) plays the mysterious, masked captor, trying to get information from Jamie through intimidation, violence, and a weird sort of kindness (??). Things drag on until the final 20 minutes or so, when Alice Krige (GHOST STORY, SLEEPWALKERS, SILENT HILL) makes her appearance. Ms. Krige almost saves the entire movie, but is only in it for about 15 minutes. Still, she's fascinating to watch as always! Not a terrible movie, just don't expect any nail-biting..."
4,excellent!,"I really enjoyed this movie. It kept me curious of who the kidnappers were and if the husband was really involved with the gang. Overall, it was interesting!! A must watch!!!"
5,An inspirational book,"PJ!'s book is proof that international travel can be done quickly, cheaply, and most importantly, safely. PJ! writes about exploring the cultures of foreign nations without going to tourist spots and spending too much cash. His book inspires others to get off the couch and travel. I highly recommend this book for anyone with a sense for adventure."
3,"Somewhat interesting, but poorly written","Certainly P.J.'s travelling style isn't for everyone, but the book still holds interest for the sheer diversity of place and experiences he describes. P.J.'s personality comes through well, and keeps things entertaining for a while.Unfortunately, the writing just isn't very good--the style of description quickly becomes repetitious, and the need for editing and even simple proofreading is painfully obvious. The capsule histories are often highly oversimplified, and in a few cases are downright wrong.Perhaps in the spirit of the other reviews, I should say that I've known P.J. for a while, too. Yes, he's a great guy and all, but the book could've been much better with some extra effort."
2,Travelling without seeing,"It must be a terrible burden to travel while being weighed down by the burden of plenty, openly disdaining one's own home life while glorifying anything that is different. I really wanted to like this book. As an avid traveller and travellogue reader, I was interested in the outlook of the ADD generation. It is a wonder to check off so many names without actually noticing the places you rip through and deriding those who actually take the time to absorb another culture. I hope Parmar's sensibilities mature in time to actually notice where he travels even to the point where he can at least assemble a small list of favorite places instead of relying upon snarky answers.Granted, there are some interesting parts of this book. These occur when the travelers back off the hammer and actually try to see and experience an area. All he seems to have now is an extensive list of places as flat as the sheet of paper they are written upon."
2,Not what I was looking for,"A lovely book, but as I'm very new to Collecting Antiques, it is a little to indepth for me at present.However, it now sits on the coffee table, and has gained interest."
3,Kaurismaki tell stories that nobody else tells,"Minimalist tale of an alienated young proletarian with all the basic problems somebody can have in that situation: dysfunctional family, abuse and loneliness. The end seems like the only exit possible from the situation, and is a shame that is like this. Is not enchanting like ""Moving Clouds"" and doesn't have that kind of off-beat humor from ""The Man from Nowhere""... Is slow, methodical and inflexible, but nevertheless we feel for the protagonist (the same blond girl from those two films). Not for a depressing Saturday night."
1,bleak simplicity merged with sheer boredom,"70 wasted minutes, and I believe that I have a large interest and tolerance in trying out diverse films. There are far more clever and intriguing films out there that plumb the depths of revenge and meager existences."
4,Perfect emulation of the old Activision games. Interface is sloppy.,"The good:If you like the old Activision games for the Atari 2600, this is the software for you. The emulation is exact and includes pretty much all of the original Activision titles.The game allows you to use the keyboard, mouse (to simulate paddles) or a gamepad and it all works well.The bad:The retro 80's interface is more of a pain than anything. You have to use the keyboard to select the games, and then have to go through multiple steps to get there. A simple list of games to select would be better.Also, there is no documentation on how to play any games, and worse, you can select which game mode you want (the same as the game select on the old 2600), but there is no documentation on what the games are, so I hope you still have your old 2600 game documentation."
2,This one does not measure up.,I own several Calphalon pieces and was somewhat disappointed with this one. The overall thickness and weight of this piece does not measure up with my other pieces and the bottom is slightly warped. Those of you who cook on a glass top stove knows how frustrating that can be. The pan is constantly spinning around and the heat is not distributed evenly causing the food to cook faster in the center of the pan than everywhere else.
4,YES has begun!!!!!!!,This album is an early selection of songs by the first age of YES. It's a lot of magic moments for the 70's!!!!!..and the begin of a great and formidable chapter in the progressive rock history.
5,Montana's markers,"173 roadside markers are described in this book, arranged by section of the state. How many times have you been driving along a road when suddenly a historical marker appears along the side and there is no way to stop and read it? Books like this eliminate the frustration of passing those markers by. And from the amount of text on Montana's signs, it is much more convenient reading it from a book than from the sign itself. There is also a thorough index and a useful bibliography included. The book would be interesting to armchair travelers, too. A convenient way for travelers to learn Montana's history."
1,Extremely poor recording quality,"The quality is about as bad as on my earlier purchase ""Take Five"", also by Rhoda Scott. Waste of money.""Jake"" (Netherlands)"
2,Of another time,An 18th century author writing about the dark ages. It reads more like incidents within a narrative rather than a single story. I found the ending abrupt and not credible. I expected more of the creator of Sherlock Holmes.
3,Problem with the printing?,"I enjoyed the book and loved the illustrations. But the text on many of the pages in my copy is faded, like a bad photocopy. Legible, but faded. I'd return it, but if they're all like that, there's no point."
5,Absorbing and Enjoyable,"The White Company was said to be one of Canon Doyle's favorite creations, and it does show the great pains he took in research, both in speech and the customs of the day. The plot ramps up slowly at the start but once it gets going, hang on for the adventure of your life- it is non-stop heart pounding action. And throw in a budding romance and you have one heck of a tale. I found the White Company a more tightly constructed book then Sir Nigel, which was subsequently written as the prequel to the White Company. I found the final ending of the story a tad Hollywoodish, but I suppose he wanted a happy one. All in all, one of the most memorable books I've read."
1,Amateurish typesetting makes reading unpleasant,"If you are a bookworm like me, the first thing you will notice when you open this book are the very long lines. Of course this makes reading stressful: sometimes your eyes get lost as you jump from one line to the next. I actually counted around 85 characters (including letters and spaces but not punctuation) per line. Robert Bringhurst recommends from 45 to 75 characters, ideally 66.Also, the margins are so narrow that you need to contort the book to be able to read the letters near the middle.Another sign of amateurish typesetting is that ""symmetric"" quotes are used.I guess this work is public domain. Next time, instead of buying the cheaper edition, I'll look for a more reputable publisher.This is a review of the paperback edition, and refers only to the typesetting, not the contents of the book itself. (Actually I don't know if I'll be able to read it.)"
3,An informative novel.,"A company of archers, led by their captain, Sir Nigel, leave England to fight in Bordeaux, France, at the start of the Hundred Years War. A very historical book, containing much information about the War, which might be found in many history books. It may be slightly more of a history book rather than a truly fiction book, nonetheless, a book written exceptionally well, with action and suspense, in the style of Conan Doyle, a prolific author best known for his detective stories in Sherlock Holmes and also in the White Company's companian piece, Sir Nigel. This book is for anyone who would enjoy reading about medieval history and times."
4,Moody Piano Work,"I can't speak for the work in the film, but the music works pretty well on its own - mainly moody piano numbers. Give it a listen."
3,Not essential Hancock and lacks something without the film..,"I haven't seen this movie so I can't really comment on how it works with the film. I do have a lot of Herbie Hancock's stuff, and I don't feel that this music holds together well as independent compositions. It's really dark music as well in terms of its tonality and mood; probably very appropriate for the scenes it accompanies but a little depressing to me heard in stark isolation. I'd recommend this for Hancock completists, but all of his Blue Note albums, Headhunters stuff, even the Warner Brothers recordings would come way in advance of this one.--SD"
5,Daisy size,"There is no size given in the description of the white daisy appliques. I want to install them on a shower floor with 4 1/4 inch square tiles, and I don't want the decal to overlap onto the grout. Can someone tell me the size of these decals? Thanks!"
2,permanent,I ended up not using this product after realizing it would be permently affixed to my tub. I didnt feel like rueining my bath tub just for a little more grip.
2,Weak adhesive,"I bought these to make my shower safer for my upcoming hip surgery. I applied the ""stickers"" according to the manufacturers directions onto my clean, dry tiled shower floor. They worked fine for two months, but are starting to ""come up"" on their own. The manufacturer needs to apply a stronger adhesive to the product. I still have a few older (20+ years) stickers on my shower floor that I inherited with the house. These products are hard to find anymore, liability reasons?"
4,Lasted longer than others,"As a ""senior"", I needed some traction in the shower and after trying other brands that didn't last a week, got this one. It's been a year and a half now and the decals are still sticking! Just remember before placing them in shower/tub, you should thoroughly clean tub, rub with alcohol, and dry with hair dryer. After placing decals down, use rolling pin or similar to finish sticking. Works for me!"
3,"Old school, cute and effective","We did have 1 start to peel off already (after about a month or two), but otherwise they are fantastic and pretty cute in the tub."
1,Did not stay adhered for more than a week,Unfortunately they did not remain adhered to out bath for more than a week before most of them came off. We followed the directions for installation as specified. I would not recommend this product.
2,They don't stick.,After my wife first installed these we thought we had found the answer to a problem we have had. Other appliques did not stick well at all. In a matter of days they came off. The same thing happened with these. It just took a few more days.The appliques I had applied about 25 years ago almost had to be blasted off. Wish we could find some that would stick and stay stuck.
1,Waste of Money and a Safety Risk,"Very displeased with the item, it was not expensive, and hardly worth a return. They did not work! I followed all directions in application, including using the longest wait time suggested. They didn't seem exceptionally sticky to start with, but I thought maybe the curing process would make a difference.After three showers (two days) one fell off, I replaced it with a new one and three showers later it was off again as well as several others. They did not even make it to a 'cleaning' day to worry about cleaning products being an issue.I remember these from long ago, but obviously they used a different adhesive back then. Its more than how they look, they are unsafe if you expect it to keep you or your children from slipping. A waste of money and a safety issue waiting to happen!"
1,disppointment in product,"I am very disappointed in this product. I applied them to my tub per the directions on the package. Each decal has slipped from the area I applied them to. I have a handicapped parent using this tub and had they slipped while they were using the tub, the result could have been very hurtful"
1,Waste of money & time,"Adhesive shower/tub decals seem like a relatively easy product to get right. Unfortunately, as several reviewers had already mentioned, they last a week or two (it you're lucky). Then they begin to peel off very quickly. This was a waste of money, and a total waste of time on my part. Perhaps it would adhere to certain materials better than others, but a week's use out of these is unacceptable. This product is not recommended at all."
2,Dissapointed in bathtub decals,These bathtub decals don't stick very well. I'm glad I bought 2 packs because I am constantly having to replace them.
2,Two fails. I won't try again,"After the first time I bought these stickers and applied them to my tub shower, and they began to peel off, I figured maybe I did something wrong, so I decided to try again and ordered another package of these. I followed the instructions to the letter. I made sure the tub was bone dry. I applied them with substantial elbow grease. I made sure the surface didn't get wet for 24 hours as recommend, but I waited a full 2 days, by showering in the other bathroom. Everything I did, I did correctly. The stickers at the back of the tub, where I don't stand, remained in place (hey, that's worth 2 stars), but at the front of the tub, where I mostly stand during my showers, these decals began coming up within a week. The quality just isn't good enough. I'm now looking for a different brand."
2,not as good as I thought,"I bought a few packs of these decals because I didn't want my mom to slip and fall in her bathtub. A few days after applying, they started peeling off. I followed the directions: make sure the tub is dry before applying and wait 24 hours before using the tub again. I'm somewhat surprised at the results because most of the reviews on Amazon are positive. But considering the cheap price, I think the product is still worth a shot. It didn't work for me, but it might work for you."
1,these are worthless,These are the worst decals ever. I bought these in place of those rubber mats for the tub that get all gross and full of bacterial and mold. I followed the directions about how it said to wash the tub then wipe with alcohol to remove reside and soap build up. I stuck them to the floor of my tub once it was dry and reside free. Well 3 days later they started peeling off. Not all at once but a few each shower till they all came off. I was very disappointed. But for the price I wasn't going to complain (too much).
1,Junk,"These are useless. I followed the instructions to the letter, and also used a blow drier on the tub to ensure it was completely dry before applying the decals. I let them stay on for about 30 hours before using the shower, but a few minutes in to the first shower they started to peel off and float towards the drain....."
1,very dissatisfied,"I followed the instructions thoughly and gave them double the time to dry out than what was recommended. But, the decals started to peel off within 2 weeks. I do not recommend this product.Compac Select Safe-T-Shapes Bathtub Decals, Daisy"
1,non slip,"barely works! it seems like i need to buy another package to get what i want out of the item, i have only had for a few months and 3 of the pads have fallen off. i do not suggest to buy."
1,Starting to come unstuck !,"Followed direction to the tee. Now their coming undone after only eight months. What happened to the decals we had when we were kids. They stayed down forever! I wouldn't recommend these unless you wish to replace them every eight months. Now I have to find a better brand,since these suck!"
1,Poor Bathtub Safety Stickers,"After properly cleaning my bathtub and allowing to dry, I placed the safety stickers in the desired locations and the tub went unused for 24 hours. However, almost all of the stickers have peeled off and my 1 year old twins are sliding all over the place. The set I had as a child are still in my mothers tub, so I guess they do not make these as they used to either. Does not stay stuck, so it is a poor product and does not last past 1 - 2 weeks."
2,disappointed,"I followed the directions exactly, and allowed the decals to dry 36 hours (instead of the recommended 24). Within one week, one decal had peeled off. Within two weeks, three have peeled off and I'm once again slipping in the tub. Looks like I'll have to go back to the clunky and awkward bath mat, which is disappointing."
5,no fear of fall,"my husband is 84, and was afraid to stand up in the tub. Now he feels more sure footed; with the decals."
5,Great!,"They look very nice in the bottom of my bathtub. I feel like I am taking a shower in the meadow full of daisies. I feel very confident with them, my bathtub was very slippery before. After several months only one little flower came off, and I ordered another pack for future replacements. I love them!"
5,"For anyone who procrastinates, this is the book to read!",An excellent guide to developing tenacity and persistence in everything that you do...but especially in the workplace. Great tips and suggestions on how to follow through what you start!
2,Should have bought the single.,"Purchased because of ""The Hop"", but with the exception of one other song, the album reminds me too much of 1960s experimental jazz. I've really got to stop purchasing music without sampling it first."
2,So this is what it takes to get to space?,"For all the effort at giving us the minutia about how space travel will come to pass, Aldrin and Barnes have to invent spacefaring cats and a series of stupid moves by humans to get us off our earthbound duffs and to the stars. Buzz must be pretty frustrated with the progress of the space program to resort to such plot devices. Ignore the praise from Arthur C. Clarke, he must have been thinking about some other novel..."
2,This will not make your Book Recommendations Contest,"Although the technical detail of Buzz Aldrin's novelis refreshingly accurate, it is clear to me thatJohn Barnes has not held to his part of the bargain-- namely, to bring the same level of attention toplot and characterization to the novel as his associateDr. Aldrin has brought the realities of space flight.The novel samples a range of characters, none ofwhich are treated with enough concentration to make themmemorable. Any richness of character is sorely absent.I cared little for the number of faceless astronautsof the novel, but no less so than, evidently, Mr. Barnes.In my view, their collaborative effort is a failure: thenovel still reads with the flat ring of Buzz Aldrin,Scientist and Astronaut; Nowhere in it do I see any markat all of the artist's hand."
2,Dialogue silly; some inaccuracies in technical details,"I gave up on this book 250 pages though because it couldn't hold my interest. Aldrin and Barnes are more technically oriented than some but they went in a little over their heads. I appreciate technical details but they must be consistent and accurate, otherwise they annoy and detract from the plot. The plot wasn't all that coherent in the first place--this was not ""page turner"". The dialogue was not realistic. The charaters' speech were too artificial in their use to explain this and that. Some of the subjects the ""professionals"" spoke about were too simplistic for actual professionals to discuss. They sounded more like space enthusiasts. Maybe I would have enjoyed this more as a juvenile."
1,product showed up water damaged,"I would not buy from them again, the product was not as described it was obviously water damaged therefore nearly impossbile to read and turn the pages without breaking the spine. I will not buy from them again."
3,"Interesting plot with a few holes, poor to average writing","Somewhat unusual hard SF with a rather unique, very interesting basic plot premise. I would have loved this book except I couldn't stop thinking how unlikely it was that there could be a race like the Tiberians - very scientifically advanced yet seemingly as dumb as a stump when it comes to dealing with adverse conditions and primitive races. Come on guys - I guess you could blow it once but twice?? What did John Barnes do? I think all the NASA-type stuff and probably some of the physics as well came from Buzz, but where was the hand of the experienced author who should have been responsible for patching the holes in the plotline and improving the often sophomoric prose"
3,"Good in parts, but slow sometimes","I really liked Tiber. I like the concept of going back and forth in time and enjoyed seeing the view points of the different Tiberian races and the earthlings- maybe the BC earthlings should have had a bit more character. After all they were able to trick a species about 8000 years ahead of them, they should have had some more depth to them.I enjoyed the technical explanations to a point - I am a long time fan of Arthur C. Clarkes books and there is quite a bit of SF technical descriptions there - but at times it got to much from Aldrins descriptions of how things exactly might work. Even I had to scan over some paragraphs to not get too bored.Maybe the middle section with all the Tiberian views were a little too long and could had been interrupted a couple of times - also the end was very anti climactic - but it was fun anyway."
1,"Awful , Extremely Disappointed","Saw an older, elegant version of this book in 1984 in the Taos NM Library, with beautiful drawings and pictures and cover, on large paper. This edition is disappointing, bulky and heavy, in a standard textbook size, with an unispiring, ugly cover, zeroxed pages of the original, showing distracting lines of the original papers' edges. Big waste of space of paper, with enormous margins all the way around. So far, haven't seen any picures or drawings, which was primarily the reason I purchased this book. Would have returned it, if I hadn't opened it, but didn't know it was terrible until I did. Have buyer's remorse. Pricey and definitely not worth it. Would not recommend this edition at all. Stuck it in library shelves til I have the willingness to open it again."
5,Love this idea,"I first checked this book out at the library. Finding that I loved the concept and the templates she offers, I knew I had to buy it. The actual quilt may take forever, but I love the thought of slowly making each block. Good alternative color ideas also included."
5,A lifesaver in the kitchen!,"One of the best things about this pasta set was being able to throw away my plastic colander. This was worth its weight in gold from the day I brought this home. Pasta cooks very nicely in this combination, as does steamed vegetables. It's particularly helpful when boiling crab legs- much easier to simply lift out the insert than to take all those pesky legs and put them in a colander. This is also great for making pot roasts that could be made in a stockpot or crockpot- the strainer makes it very easy to separate the stock for making gravy. So many uses, so little time!"
5,Buy This Pot!,"I very nearly didn't, thanks to the comments of reviewer Glam72 in San Francisco. Having never used Calphalon, I didn't know how seriously to take the comment about it requiring 1/2 hour to heat the water, but did know that my life isn't about waiting around for pots to boil. However, after a fruitless search for another pasta cooker with an insert that goes clear to the bottom of the pot, I bought this set. Within five minutes of taking it out of the box, I had it on the stove with four quarts of cold water in it and my stopwatch running. 9.75 minutes from cold to rolling boil, and the only ""cheat"" was that I turned the burner on to begin heating while I was filling the pot. This I can live with. Given my new found passion for Italian cooking, I'm expecting this pot to become one of the ""couldn't live without's"" in my kitchen."
1,Not very good!!!,These were not very good. My children won't even eat them. The consistency was very strange and it didn't have much flavor at all. Never buy again!!
1,Astoundingly Boring and Pointless,"This book was a total waste of money and time. Boring, repetitive and uninspired photos taken years ago by an architectural photographer for his clients and I have no idea why someone thought this worthy of publication.I'm planning on returning it."
4,Better than I thought!,"I thought this would have barely any special effects or supernaturalness to it, but i was wrong. It was a lot more exciting and creepier than i first thought and I don't think it got the credit it deserved. They should have advertised better in the commercials, because it was a lot better than they had led me to believe. See for yourself though."
4,Great quality,"Had seen the movie before, and was just in the mood to watch it. The quality on amazon was great"
3,Review,"There were a couple of pixellation issues with this movie, especially considering I ordered the blu-ray version. Otherwise not too bad."
4,Eeirie!,Good movie with supernatural emphasis. As usual Bacon's acting is superb. I would buy it for a friend without hesitation.
1,God-Awful Movie,"Read the novel by Richard Matheson if you want a good ghost story. This movie is far too Hollywood and does nothing right except two scenes. It also blasphemies by including footage from Night of the Living Dead! I barely made it through w/o turning off the movie and returning it right then and there. This is one of those movies that feels like it's trying really hard to give you the finger. And ""Paint It black"" by The Rolling Stones, one of my favorite songs, appears only in one scene and it's just a lame cover. AWFUL MOVIE!"
1,Out of millions of people 500 people liked this movie,"that explains the good reviews they bought this dvd. The rest of the us should save our money, this is a disappointing film.y"
3,Kevin Bacon and eggs,"They could very easily have called this film ""Chopping The Sea Noodle."" Being an animal lover, I seldom enjoy films that do not have octopi in them, but this one was okay because dead people doing stuff sometimes make you think about stuff one wouldn't ordinarily think about. Man, this movie would have been better if I'd had some popcorn, but it makes me somewhat gassy. The popcorn I mean."
3,"Good acting, stunning visuals, mediocre plot","This movie is worth seeing, particularly if you're a Kevin Bacon fan. He does a great job here, playing a likeable, good-hearted guy. He gets excellent support from his fellow cast members, too. And the visual effects here, particularly during the ""hypnosis"" sequence, are awe-inspiring. However, the film overall was disappointing for me. I never felt that involved or interested in it. Not a bad rental, though."
1,poor,"When I recieved the movie in the mail, the case was broken in a few places but the disk was intact, but when I played the movie, it froze halfway through and wouldn't go any further.I don't drive so I couldn't take it to the post office to return."
2,Ive seen better ghosts movies then this,"This film is just like the The Sixth Sense film. Both films have the same borring plot.THE BORRING PLOT.In the two movies they have 2 boys who can see and speak to ghosts and in the 2 movies there are 2 teenagers girls who are ghosts who want help and showing the boy and man the people who had kill them. After the boy and the man shows and tells other people who has killed the 2 teenagers, the two teenager girls ghosts are happy and they are at pease at last.The Sixth Sense and this film is deserve to be seen only one time and after that you dont want to see again.If you are like me and love ghosts who are bad and evil and kills people, you will love 13 Ghosts. That film is what I called a good ghost film."
2,Yawn,"Hollywood loves to pump out a couple of the same plot line movies at the same time. For instance, first there was Deep Impact, then came Armageddon, followed shortly by a half dozen cheesy meteor movies.Stir of Echo is the weak effort of The Sixth Sense movie concept. ""I See Dead People Everywhere"" and so does Kevin in this movie.Why go for the bronze when you can go for the gold. Wait a few weeks and pick up the Sixth Sense, Echoes is barely worth renting, you certainly will not find this movie worth watching over and over."
2,Not even close to Sixth sense,"Sixth sense was a good movie, and this one isn't even close to beeing one. It starts off pretty promising with Kevin Bacon having very weird and scary dream sequences, and some encounters with the ghost that scared me quite a bit. But then the scary part of this movie ends and it focuses more on Kevin and his family. The last hour of the movie is really boring and predictable, and the end is the standard thriller ending. I understand why Sixth sense got all the attention and this film was left behind. Sixth sense is actually good."
4,stir of echoes,This was a great movie. It has alot of suspense and alot of excitement. If you liked stigmata or the sixth sense then this movie is for you.
3,Horrifying beginning...,This movie started out so scary that I actually screamed out loud at one point. But the movie sort of fizzled and then fell flat with a too typical ending... but the first part! ...definately made it worth seeing!
5,WOW WHAT A MOVIE,"I think this is definitely one of the best films i have ever saw. This movie had horror, suspense and a little mystery too it. It was better then the sixth sense, and I have watched it over and over again. If you want a movie that will scare you and make you wonder if there really are ghosts out there. This is the movie for you. WOW! I am amazed that this didn't get what it deserved in the theaters. A TRUE A++++++ FILM. The dvd is great just wished there was more like deleted scenes, or a different ending but this movie is fun to watch again and again."
5,very creepy thriller,"this movie was very creepy. it should not be compared to the sixth sense, but if it were, i feel this one wins out. it is a lot like the sixth sense in that it is about ghosts and has a little boy who can see them, it is unlike it in many ways. it is much scarier and very suspensful. enjoy the movi"
4,Don't Watch Before Bed!,"I didn't know what to expect of this movie when first renting it. I hadn't heard much about it, and didn't even remember it being on at the theater. But....let me tell you....I WAS TOTALLY CREEPED OUT AND LOVED IT! The movie had me tensed up through the whole thing, waiting to be spooked again. I think Stir of Echoes was so creepy because it is one of those movies where it can actually happen, unlike movies like Friday the 13th, Halloween, etc. I totally loved this movie, and even seeing Sixth Sense first, I was not the least bit disappointed by this one. I definetly recommend watching Stir of Echoes, just be sure to watch long before going to bed!"
2,A little disapointing...,"Although I loved this movie, the picture quality is one of the worst I've seen on Blu-ray to date. The picture was very soft, and grainy in parts. Despite these facts, it is still visually superior than its standard dvd counterparts but no match for most of the Blu-ray disc I've seen. The sound faired much better, there was lots of separation and bass."
2,Ok Movie but not HD,Save yourself the money and just by the DVD. This moving is not in HD. I am not sure why they would even offer it on Blu-ray other then to make more money. Just buy the standard DVD. Good story line though.
4,"Very eeerie, so much better than 'The Sixth Sense'","You might wonder why people keep comparing this film to ""The Sixth Sense"". For starters, it came out at the same time. Secondly, it has a similar theme.Kevin Bacon is outstanding in this film, quite possibly his best performance ever. He plays a loving husband with one child. One evening after experimenting with hypnotherapy, he acquires strange powers which allows him to see evil things that have occurred or are about to occur. This might sound far-fetched, but it really works, and does not deter from the quality of this script.When I first saw this film, I became very spooked, and had to check that all the doors were locked. Films that can create this sort of eeeriness are few and far between, and worth a look. Even if you do not like being freaked out, watch it with the view to the fine performances. Watch with the lights on, if that helps.A DVD which I highly recommend purchasing. Very happy to have it in my collection."
3,Murder Mystery disguised as a scary movie,"This was a good movie, a weird movie, and most of all a very predictable movie. It had several things which did not make sense, such as a small boy sees a dead girl named Samantha, and his father played by Kevin Bacon gets hypnotized at a party and can suddenly see the dead girl as well. This movie is a combination between the crazy hallucinations of Poltergeist, the dead people of the Sixth Sense, and its really a murder mystery movie disguised as a thriller / scary movie. As weird as the movie and the hallucinations of Kevin Bacon are, it does climax quite nicely and predictably at the end, making the movie worth a watch. There are very good amount of DVD features like a music video (which is terrible) enough TV spots on the DVD to get you bored of the movie before it starts."
2,It's just O.K. - predictable but well done,"I was going to put 3 stars but 3 should be for atleast ""good "" movies. STIR is just o.k.; good. Nothing special, nothingnew, very predictable... BUT it isn't bad either. It has good acting, decent but well known, used story and it shot, directed well. I rented the DVD, but STIR is a movie you can wait to see on HBO or Showtime. You can save your money."
4,First of all....I liked it.,"First of all....I liked it. Now here's a story of a boy who can see dead people...no I am not talking about the Bruce Willis movie, but Kevin Bacon's. The difference...while the little boy can see dead people...so can the dad. Stir of Echoes has the son seeing people he doesn't want to see and giving messages to people who may not want to hear them. Bacon, while at a party, gets hypnotized and the hypnotist throws a suggestion in his mind for Bacon to be more ""open minded""...this leads to his new ""look"" on life or death depending on your perspective. The filming is gritty, has some intense scenes, and a bit of the ""oh wow"" that comes from the audience makes for a great viewing experience. Stir of Echoes far surpasses the storyline of ""Sixth Sense"", but falls short at the box office. Bottom line...while some film storylines die right away...this one lives on and on and on."
4,"Not as good as ""Sixth Sense"" --- but still very good!","I was told by a friend that this movie was just as good as ""The Sixth Sense,"" so I rented it. It wasn't, but that doesn't mean it's not a good film! Some parts were excellent! Like ""Sixth Sense"" you've got a little kid who can see dead people, but this little kid isn't scared. His dad, on the other hand (played by Kevin Bacon) also acquires this ability --- by accident, after being hypnotized by his sister-in-law, who tells him under hynosis to keep ""an open mind,"" not realizing that this inadvertently OPENS HIS MIND in a way neither of them expected! There are some truly scary scenes in this one, like when the babysitter downstairs is listening to the sleeping little kid on the baby-monitor, and she hears him wake up and start whispering to an unknown somebody upstairs in his room! And there were several more scenes just as chilling! This isn't a slasher film, but it's scary none-the-less!"
5,Just as eerie as I remembered,"Dvd in excellent condition. Movie terrifying, yet interesting. It is something you can get very involved in. Not recommeded for anyone under 16."
3,"Formula ""Where is the body buried?""","Tom and Maggie Witzky (Kevin Bacon and Kathryn Erbe) go to what looks like a block party. There Tom is challenged to prove hypnosis is bunk. They get more than they bargained for when the hypnotizer, Lisa Weil (Illeana Douglas) leaves a post-hypnotic suggestion that Tom should ""open his mind""; boy does he open it and so do we.This film has some well-defined characters and the actors do not outshine their parts. The film is worth watching and watching over again. However, there is nothing exceptional about the story line or details. Most of the presentations predictable but still interesting to see how it is played out. The film renders itself well to Blu-ray and the big screen.Tremors Attack Pack (Tremors/ Tremors 2 - Aftershocks/ Tremors 3 - Back to Perfection/ Tremors 4 - The Legend Begins)"
5,Please check your pants after viewing this movie!,"WOW! This has to be the most underrated movie of 1999. This movie is guaranteed to freak you out. The visual effects, although low tech, are extremely well done and provide a very eerie look into the world of the paranormal. The plot is also done very well. Elements that are introduced throughout the film are tided together quite nicely in the end. The acting is superb, with Kevin Bacon giving the best performance of his career. He really makes you believe in his character, which is one of the elements that makes this movie work so well. I have the DVD edition, listening to this in 5.1 format is a must. The ghostlike voices that come from the rear speakers gives new meaning to the DVD experience, especially in a dark room."
4,SLEEP! DIG! GREAT HORROR MOVIE!,"""Stir of Echoes"" was a major surprise. Big time. I wanted to see it since I first saw the trailer in July but I never got around to it. I waited for video (Which most of you have probably done also) and was thoroughly impressed. So impressed in fact, that I went out and bought it the next night. It's sort of a mish-mash of ""Poltergeist"", ""The Shining"", ""Rosemary's Baby"", ""The Sixth Sense"" and whatever else ghost movies are out there for that matter. Kevin Bacon gives the performance of a lifetime and the movie has dazzling surprises that truly surprise. On the DVD, I LOVED that creepy cool menu beginning. All those flash cuts and stuff FREAKED ME OUT! If you LOVE good horror flicks, this one is for you! It's pretty scary."
4,Stir of Echoes,"A little slow at the beginning, but more than makes up for it in the long run.The performance of the three main characters was excellent, and they really let you feel the emotions.For those not into horror (like me), this movie was gripping, without being over the edge."
5,Killer Thriller,"Very good film. It's one of the few thrillers that of that decade that was actually thrilling. Each character was very real and surprisingly not annoying like in most movies in this genre. You know the characters I'm talking about where you're screaming at the screen ""What are you doing?!"" or ""Why wouldn't he/she bring a weapon with them?!"" (we've all done it). For the most part the idea and story was pretty original. Yeah there have been movies about spirits haunting houses and the people living in them before but this movie takes it to another level and introduces an interesting way as to how the spirit gets introduced to Kevin Bacon's character with the hypnosis. The cinematography was very well done especially in creating an eerie mood at the right times. Overall great film definitely one of my favorites. Worth multiple watches. Definitely buy this one."
2,Poor Film Adaption of a Good Book,"Read the book! it is shame that the novel is listed as only a ""basis"" for the film. (Elsie the seductive neighbor, the surprise ""twist"" at the end, Anne's struggle as a wife to understand Tom's condition-all left out. Why?) I think if they used more of the novel's elements the movie would have done better in light of the blockbuster ""Sixth Sense"" The acting is good, a few suspenful elements in the film, but Bacon' plays Tom Wallace as a ignorant blue collored worker that doesn't really tap the author's character in the book. I'm glad I rented it, but angry at the hatchet job Hollywood perform on a very good book."
4,Great edition!!!,This is a great edition of this movie... the interviews are awesome... but what?? no theatrical trailer...I was expecting the trailer since it was awesome...awesome trailer!!!the dvd menus are a little hard to manage since images change a lot and the pointers seem a little stuck... but be patient... the dvd edition is great...I love the fact that they made a special section for the kid actor... I thought he was awesome...highly recommended!
3,"Not a classic like ""The Sixth Sence"" or ""The Others""...","...but entertaining absolutely. And, no, I didn't ruin the experience by watching it during daylight, me and a friend of mine watched this one late and rainy night eager to get ""spooked"".Did we?Despite its' predictable outcome (of almost every scene, this has been done many times before now), well, yes -it did manage to be convinsing and creepy at times, it sure wasn't a waste of time. But it's made out of rather used material to put it like that, so for people not being too much fan of this thriller-kind of the genre I guess some would call it ""old"". And boring being that.Me myself, being a big fan of the genre -well, glad to have added this to my collection. Good acting, effective camera-work and sound-effects, mean-looking ghost -yes ""spooky"" indeed. Just a bit unoriginal."
5,Excellent movie on it's own,"Why people compare this to the SIXTH SENSE is beyond me. The psychic powers of the son occupy little more than a few minutes of screen time, and the most dramatic event associated with the son, the ""feathers"" scene, was more of a directorial attempt to avoid having to kill the child.This production has more unseen tricks than one can talk of in a small review, but suffice to say, the commentary track does have a lot of gems. Hopefully I can get the special edition, since I have some high expectations for that product.Anyways, this is a genre film, so it has common themese to a bunch of films, and is only very superficially in the vein of the SIXTH SENSE.It's a great film to watch, and Kevin Bacon does a great job."
2,Meh,"A poor man's Sixth Sense. I generally like Kevin Bacon but he's a little over the top with the Chicago working stiff act in this one. It doesn't help that the story's predictable and not particularly engaging (nor particularly scary). The Blu-Ray transfer seemed fine to me, but the video that plays in the menu background gives away key plot points, which is not cool at all."
3,Good Movie,"Stir of Echoes is a good, supernatural thriller. It's above the other movies nowadays. Bacon is great."
2,BOOOORRRIIIINNNGGG,"To start it off, let me say I'm a huge ghost story fan, a huge Kevin Bacon fan, and an even bigger Richard Matheson fan. Logically, the three of these together should be awesome. In actually, it turned out to be a feature length episode of Ghost Whisperer. Incredibley typical plot, annoying and illogical plot twists at the end, and a total of 3 minutes of screentime for the scary ghost. Who taught these people how to make movies? I only gave it two stars because, as I said, the ghost was pretty creepy. But don't try to solve the mystery along with the our hunky lead, because the answer comes out of left field. Total Dissapoinment."
3,No Spanish Subtitles,Hello! I bought a DVD (A Stir of Echoes) two months ago and I got ir around a week ago. The product is Ok except for the fact that it doesn't have Spanish subtitles. When I ordered it the description of the product said it had them but when I tried it I realized it didn't. Here I send the link where the description shows that the DVD has Spanish subtitles: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002DB54A/ref=oh_details_o01_s00_i02I hope we can find a solution to this problem. Thank you very much for your time!!!
4,Great film,"To bad ""Sitxh Sense"" was out at the same time. Great thinier movie. Kevin Bacon does a great job. Much better then in Hollowman. Very good - there is even a couple points in the film that WILL make you jump!"
4,Stir of Echos,"I heard good and bad things about this movie and I was a little skeptic about viewing it since I'm picky about what I watch because I'm so busy,,, anyway,,, I was very impressed,,,It has a very unique twist to it that you'll have to find out for yourself,,,,I wasn't going to say it but I must say that I enjoyed this film more than the SIXTH SENSE,, dare I say it??happy movie viewing......."
4,Surrealy Kris,"Surreal Thing is vintage Kristofferson that combines country and rock n' roll with a approprietly heavy back-up band. The fifth and last track show the most humor, while the seventh is the most romantic. The opening track is both in a great slow version with then-wife Rita. This is a wonderfully mood-minded album that should belong to any Kris-collector."
5,A much appreciated collection .,"Never owned the VHS version but always had those memories of the MTV videos of the past. No hesitation in purchasing the new DVD Anthology, especially in the expanded version. Also really wanted to experience the 5.1 Dolby Digital upgrade with this offering. The 5.1 is truely an upgrade sonically ! Don't put off getting that DVD machine any longer. Is great cruising through the old videos, and also seeing old concert footage --Thunderroad, both versions of Born to Run, Tunnel of Love tour footage, etc. Add the 2nd disc to the picture --brought up to the Reunion , and it nicely covers the span. A very satisfying product I must say. It assuredly is a 'must have' for the Springsteen enthusiast, collector, fan, believer. Would also highly recommend the other recent release ""Blood Brothers"" . And here's hoping for an additional treat with the possible release of a Reunion Tour DVD ."
3,Video is improtant also,"As much as I am thirilled to have all of these tracks now on DVD so I can hear the great audio, the video quality is horrible. The whole point of DVD is to have better video quality than on a VHS, this does not. Excuses can be made for the old concert footage, but even the newest of videos have alot of artifacts. In the end I will listen to this DVD often, but not watch it anymore. It can not hold a candle to the Beastie Boys Anthology."
2,An audio injustice,"I agree with the previous comments about the technical quality of this DVD. Compared to the Eagles ""Hell Freezes Over"" DTS DVD, the producers should be ashamed of this effort. It pales in comparison to other remastered material, like the Talking Heads ""Stop Making Sense"". Although a great selection of material by the Boss (perhaps a bit heavier on the 90's material than I'd prefer), the surround sound audio track if absolutely awful and I refuse to even play it anymore -- the standard PCM audio simulated into surround sound is much better."
2,Technically disappointing,"Although Springsteen fans doubtless won't care, this DVD was a big disappointment from a technical standpoint. The video is not especially sharp and suffers from many problems of live concert footage such as poor camera angles and lighting. Be aware also that this DVD is not in widescreen format. Likewise the sound quality was not up to my expectations - the surround sound aspect was limited and the clarity of the recording was far below any studio albums."
3,Good live performances on disk 1,Disk 1 is very good with live performances. Disk 2 was not that great and is videos. I wanted the song Rosalita as that is the best song and is missing from latest DVD's.
2,This Disc is Weak,"The only reason I gave it two stars is because I need to feel I didn't totally waste $24.00. I am a huge Bruce fan but this is the worst of Bruce. The acting videos are campy, the live videos are good. The acoustic Born in the USA is about the worst!!!! It is so pretentious, this is BAD blues at best. Also there is no DVD extras at all, no commentary, no interviews...nothing. This DVD is awful."
2,Buy the concert dvd instead,"New Springsteen fans may enjoy this anthology, but I was disappointed.The concert dvds are much better."
2,Please Tell Me A Concert DVD Of The Reunion Tour Is Coming,"I am a huge Bruce fan, but found this DVD extremely disappointing. I had forgotten just how cheesy those Born in the USA videos were. Bruce & the E Street Band would be perfect on a live concert DVD. Let's hope he puts one out."
3,Not bad,"I was drawn to these after Trader Joe's stopped selling their 25 cent fruit strips. These are quite similar, though they are unmistakably apple based. I found little difference from flavor to flavor, and the texture is a little grainy. However, they make good snacks."
3,Nice upgrade!!,"This pot is perfect for cooking a box of Macaroni & Cheese! The heat is distributed evenly... BUT BE CAREFUL - THE HANDLES GET EXTREMELY HOT! They aren't 'insulated' like other pots I've owned - I burned my fingers really bad the first time I took the lid off - Cosmetically, it is a beautiful pot - but don't get it confused with the ""Commercial"" version of Calphalon's ""Hard-Anodized"" cookware - they don't have the same appearance at all.... Anyways, happy eating!"
3,Ouch...,"This is a great pot for cooking, but the handles get very, very hot. My other pans have cool handles, so about once a week I accidently pick up this pan without hotpad holders and burn my fingers. Why would such a good pan come with such low-end handles? I will only buy Calphalon ""commercial"" pots and pans from now on--they have appropriate handles."
1,Waste of time and money.,Waste of time and money. The tape primarily consists of affirmation phrases with dopey music in the background. Totally useless.
1,Terrible,The worst audio book ever. They repeat the 10 mins or so of affirmations 2-3 times on each side of the casette wasting any time they might have had to teach you something and the affirmations are not even that good.
4,Plenty of Information,I like this one for the basic information to seek further facts of the old west. Many were locations I would like to visit.
4,a must-read for women of size,"This book is one that should be read by all women of size. The author's non-apologetic and positive approach to the subject matter can't help but encourage and empower the women who are fortunate enough to read this book. The writing style is direct, and the book is an easy read--unlike some self-improvement and self-help books on the market. I am already planning to share this book with the other bountiful women in my life."
3,NOT a 20-Inch Bear,"We bought this for our 5-year old daughter, who had been asking for a ""big bear"" for her birthday. We specifically looked for bears that were at least 20 inches and ended up buying this one. It's cute, soft and cuddly, but it's only 16 inches head toe... so it's not a BIG bear, and it's not 20 inches. If you don't care about the length, go for it."
4,RECOMMENDED,Written and directed by Finnish director Aki Kaurismäki in 1988. You'll love the style of this unique director who manages to mix tragedy and humour with elegance. Recommended.
2,HC,Bad specification. it is not aplicable for all models that are specified. Bad comunication with seller
1,Would never buy from again,Used the item for 3 days then it stopped working. I contacted the seller's customer service and they never got back to me.. I am very unsatisfied.
1,undersized-,"Hardly fit a 27 lb. dog very tightly- wonder what it would have looked like on a ""large"" as it said dog- I think it may have fit on one leg of my German Shepherd."
4,REMASTER IS NOT AS GOOD AS ORIGINAL?,"OKAY, I WON'T BOTHER WITH MY OPINIONS ON THE SONGS ON THIS ALBUM. IN BRIEF, SOME OF THE TUNES ARE BETTER REPRESENTED HERE, LIVE - WITH THE RAW ENERGY. THEN AGAIN, SOME OF THESE TUNES ARE BETTER AS THE ORIGINAL STUDIO RECORDINGS. HOWEVER, I OWN THIS REMASTERED ""IMPORT"" VERSION AND THE ORIGINAL DISC AND I FOUND THAT THIS REMASTERED VERSION HAS A ""SKIP"" TOWARDS THE END OF THE TRACK, ""WALK AWAY"". I OWNED TWO COPIES OF THIS SAME DISC AND THEY BOTH HAD IT, AND NEITHER SHOWED ANY SIGHS OF BEING SCRATCHED WHEN HELD UP TO THE LIGHT. THERE MUST HAVE BEEN SOME SORT OF MISPRINT OR SOMETHING AT THE PLANT WHILE THEY WERE MANUFACTURING IT. MY ORIGINAL RELEASE VERSION FORTUNATELY DOESN'T HAVE IT. DID ANYONE ELSE FIND THIS PROBLEM?"
2,Short and needs some remastering work bad!,"Joe Walsh cut three great CDs with his hometown (Cleveland) band, the James Gang: Yer Album, Rides Again, and Thirds. All three are great. I don't know why this sloppy live album was released unless it was to meet some contractual obligation following Joe's departure from the band. The album (yes, I had it on vinyl years ago) sounded horrible and was brief at 40-odd minutes, since most bands were releasing double live albums. Some of the James Gang's best songs are missing from this, and the audio, well, the digital age hasn't helped it. Joe, get in the studio, find some more source tapes and expand this to fill a full CD (or two!) and then have someone clean up the audio. THEN, this will be a CD worth owning. Until this, buyer beware. This, along with Joe's solo ""You Can't Argue With a Sick Mind"" (also a live album that bites, audio-wise), should be avoided until they've been expanded and remastered."
2,"It,s Frisbee material","Joe Walsh done the right thing as suggested by the song ""Walk Away"". I liked The James Gang rides again, and James Gang Bang. They had some good music. I never seen the ""Gang"" in concert and if this album represents their best on stage, I'm glad I never did."
4,James Gang - 'Live In Concert' (MCA),"Good 1971 live recording of the James Gang at their very best. Tracks that certainly had me sit up and take full notice were ""Stop"", their Albert King's cover ""You're Gonna Need Me"", their sole hit ""Walk Away"" and the awesome seventeen minute Yardbirds cover ""Lost Woman"". It's been so long since I've heard a James Gang lp or CD. Unforgetable great early '70's album rock to be fully taken in. Line-up: Joe Walsh-guitar, keyboards&vocals, Dale Peters-bass&vocals and Jim Fox-drums,organ&vocals. If you dug some of the era's better known bands like Bad Company, Mountain, Faces and Grand Funk, you should like this archive release a lot. A definite should-have."
3,3.5 Stars: Pretty Good,"I just bought this album and have listened to most of it. What I've heard I've liked. ""Stop"" is really good; ""Walk Away"" is even better. The rest of it is a bit trippy. I thought Walsh was more of a comic-rock kind of guy (As in his ""Ordinary Average Guy"" single). Better song writing than I'd expect. Cherck out the 71 version of ""Walk Away."" Amazing.The sound, however is not the greatest. It seems that they have the mics in the balconies rather than near the band. This might be the only detration from a pretty good record. I'm looking foreward to ""You Can't Argue With a Sick Mind"" from Walsh."
4,Nice flashback!,"Well I never got that LSD flashback that was promised to me by all those teachers. This is close, sort of. Price was right and it is still a great album...CD."
5,Awesome!,"This recording showcased an element of Joe Walsh that was never heard of again. I've listened to Yer' Album and Rides Again but I wasn't prepared for what I heard when I put this one on. This is quite simply some one the best progressive blues/rock live performances ever recorded. With the powerful riffs and sustained bends,wah wah and delay effects, Walsh did it all and did it well! The tone on his guitar had just enough distortion to play the notes clean, but when he cranked up the volume, it had you shakin in your boots. You could just imagine Walsh standing center stage, leaning back with his eyes closed and gritting his teeth as he let the high notes ring effortlessly. I had a new found respect for Walsh after hearing this one. I only wish it would have been a longer recording. That's my only gripe as it is too short. The James Gang will go down in my books as one of the greatest power trios ever."
1,Fools and their money should be separated,"$100 for a casserole dish? You have got to be kidding. I don't care how good it is. For $100 it better load itself up, walk itself over to the oven, turn it on and get in. I pity anyone who buys this. $100 is bad enough but look at it. What's wrong with cookware that looks like cookware?"
3,The queen of screwball comedy meets Hitchcock,Mr. and Mrs. Smith (Robert Montgomery and Carole Lombard) have a marriage with many ups and downs. One day at the office Mr. Smith finds out that he is not legally married. Surprise Mrs. Smith finds out also and waits for Mr. Smith to propose the make it legal. Some how he forgets to do this and drives her into the arms of his friend and partner.Why won't the cat eat the soup?How will all this turn out?This formula was popular in the time the movie was made. This version is a tad more complex but still is necessary to suspend reality. We do get a good look at the 1939 Worlds Fair. Carole Lombard is not quits as noisy. Robert Montgomery is good at almost slapstick situations.
1,DVDs stopped working!!,"After 4 years working perfectly, the DVDs for ""Foreign Correspondent"" and ""Dial M for Murder"" just stopped working! I've never seen this happen before!I've tried them on two DVD players, one Blu-ray player, one PC and one laptop, but I cannot see the ending to ""Dial M"" because the movie stops around the 1 hour 27 minute mark.This is very weird.Has this ever happened to anyone before?The DVDs are stored in a shelf, away from the sunlight, protected from dust and moisture... There's nothing wrong with them, but they just won't play!"
5,Great Set,I got this set for my father for Christmas. I don't think he has moved from in front of the TV since he opened them LOL. He LOVES all of them!
1,Mr. and Mrs. Smith,"A charmless, tiresome truly unfunny movie. Carole Lombard and Robert Montgomery play an unlikeable couple. Both are incredibly annoying and you'll find youself not caring one iota about these two self-absorbed grating people. This is easily Hitchcock's worst movie. Don't waste your money on this awful turkey."
4,Dial M for Murder,"I've seen ""Dial M for Murder"" in a restored 3-D theatrical presentation. The use of 3-D is the icing on the cake of this thriller. What a shame to not have released this classic in 3-D."
2,Screwball Director's Choice,"The original M&M; Smith (1941). In its own way, just as whacky as the recent Pitt/Jolie vehicle. But the similarities end there. Hitchcock's version is basically silly and not especially funny (he may have been a master of suspense, but not comedy), and headlines a slightly chubby Carol Lombard (Hitchcock's landlord who urged him to make the film--apparently against his better judgment). Robert Montgomery (not the Director's first choice) is the less-than-better half who seems over his acting head most of the time (especially compared to screwball-comedy veteran Lombard's performance).Outdoor soundstage sets look just plain phony while indoor sets look just plain cheap (and phony). Very distracting. Without Lombard, the film would have gone straight to DV...err, the drive-ins.WILLIAM FLANIGAN, Ph.D."
3,Delivered in bad condition,"The product came very quickly, however, the outer box was damaged (bent corners, plastic protective wrap shredded in some places), otherwise ok"
4,Great selection,"Good collection of Hitchcock movies!We ""killed them"" all off, in just a little over a week!"
1,Where was William Tracy?,"Hitchcock was right to stick with thrillers and suspense. This ""comedy"" offered no laughs and completely underutilized the talents of William Tracy. Although he received high billing in the film, he has one quick scene at the start and is never heard from again! Despite the tedious plot, tired acting, and predictable outcomes, I hung in there thinking we'd see more of Tracy, whose best role was in TheShop Around the Corneras Pepe Katona. Tracy was conspicuous by his absence, which may have been accentuated by the lack of engagement by the other actors. They all seemed to wish they were somewhere else other than in this film."
5,"this is not a run of the mill ""Hitchcock Movie.""","I love this movie because it nails the romantic comedy genre perfectly. Carole Lombard is still one of the greatest actresses ever and if you've never seen her before, now is a good time to go ahead and find out what you've been missing. The movie itself stands on its own without the star power. It is well-written and witty. Robert Montgomery is also fantastic. If you don't really like many Hitchcock films, don't worry, this one is different."
3,"A pretty creative idea, yet slightly overdone.","Alfred Hitchcock, master of suspense films, turned to comedy direction in this 1941 film. Even though sincerely Lombard and Montgomerey have done much better in other pictures (Carole Lombard for My Man Godfrey and Robert Montgomerey for Here Comes Mr. Jordan), this pair is delightful to view. For a better movie on the topic of marriage, check out The Awful Truth (1937) with Cary Grant and Irene Dunne."
3,It's okay.,"We were going to wait to give this to my son for christmas, however we did not. My son likes 4 out 10 of the movies on here. I only can tolerate the 1st one. The last 6 are put together into a cartoon catergory."
3,Not amazing but nice dvd,"For $5 I bought this DVD not expecting it to be 'amazing'. To be honest, the DVD is definitly not 'wow' factor but it is a cute dvd. My almost 3 year old loves it even when I was iffy of the quality. There are several shows on there and my daughter loved a few. For $5 I knew I shouldn't expect much."
3,they are what they say they are,"simple flash cards with poses pictured and not much detail on how to get into or hold each but it comes with a small book that gives a little more info. some of the cards are ""repeats"" because a pose may be included in Warm Up, Sun Salutation, Standing Poses and Finishing Poses."
4,Yoga Fun,"My Yoga class enjoyed playing a version of Texas Hold Em with this deck. It is also good for planning a session for class. The descriptions are terse, so it helps if you know the poses before hand. It is amusing, fun, if you already do Yoga."
1,FRAUD,The title clearly states that this offer is for a four count case of 1 gallon Windex bottles from this vendor. What arrived is a single gallon bottle in a box from Sam's Club. This is out and out fraud. I am so angry I can barely type. This better be a monumental screw up or I want somebody in handcuffs. Don't people understand that wire fraud is a felony?
4,Great Material...So-So Sound,"""Surrealistic Pillow"" is one of the 1960's albums that never seems to grow tired. With each listening, there seems to be a verse or a sound that resonates with current events. The Grace Slick classic ""Somebody to Love"" ignites the album and still sounds fresh and fiery. The hypnotic ""Today"" is one of the lesser-known tracks but Marty Balin's lead vocal is perfectly suited to the psychedelic music. The instrumental ""Embryonic Journey"" does'nt hold up as well but the next track, ""White Rabbit"" is the highlight of the album. Grace Slick's powerful, relentless vocal builds atop the bass and guitar chords to a screaming climax. The only flaw of this album - and it is major - ithe sound quality. There is notable suppression and hiss. A Remaster is sorely needed."
3,The Remaster Puzzle,"This is in support of the fan below who demands to know what RCA is doing (or not doing). ""All Music Guide"" says that SP was remastered and reissued in 1996 with complete mono and stereo versions and that the sound is fantastic! Can't see it listed anywhere. U.K. magazine ""Record Collector"" says that Mobile Fidelity released a gold remaster of both the mono and stereo mixes in 1995. Can't see it listed anywhere. This may explain the problem, however. Maybe RCA assigned the rights to it for a period of time or something. Someone must know what goes. I'm not buying it until it's fixed. I've heard enough 80's CD's of 60's albums to know they're to be avoided. And it's still at full price! The other two stars will have to wait."
1,Still sounds bad.,"There is no way this is a digitaly remaster as it still sucks for sound quality. The four additional tracks are remastered but the original songs from the album - no way. Save your dollars and skip this one. There is another remaster with oodles of additional tracks, perhaps it sounds better."
3,grace?,"I think marty does the best job in the group, and is/was underappreciated by them, as far as the rest of the music it is druggie music all the way."
2,So So - 60s,"Funny thing, time. As I remembered this album, it was really extra cool when it was first released; listening to it now on my recently purchased CD, it's simply alright. 'Guess ""Feeding Your Head,"" as Grace said, is still compulsory with listening to it now. Oh well. I suppose Alice still knows?A couple classic cuts makes it worth the sale price. But, it's a valid example of the old adage. . .""You Can Never Go Back."""
5,Surrealistic Pillow,"The collection of songs on this cd, particularly the after-market add-ons, make this cd a listening pleasure. They take me back to those heady nights at the fabulous Fillmore Auditorium in San Francisco."
1,"Great music, bad remastering","The music remains as gorgeous and inventive as ever. The remastering job, however, was terrible. It wasn't compressed to a fare-thee-well as some reissues are, but *something* made it sound harsh and wearying. I know the LP didn't sound like that. Maybe they used too heavy a hand with noise reduction? In any case, BMG should go back and do it again, this time with no fancy processing -- just a straight transfer of the tape."
4,Sure-it's-'licious pillow--sorry,"Whoops: I was expecting plastic bombastic psychedelia. In reality (!), it's one and a quarter sides of magnificence, and the lesser material isn't bad, definitely much better than that plastic stuff. I totally dig Grace Slick, wish she sang more, and I really dig Paul's vocals, or maybe that's Jorma I'm hearing. It's Jorma's riffs I'm feeling, especially on ""Somebody to Love,"" which would have made me turn off the stereo at one time. Not now."
4,"Good sounds,","Really enjoyed this disc, as it brought back the sound and mood of myteen years; also played it for a ""young person"" under 21,and had to order her a copy !!!!Good selection of tunes....."
3,A Fine Relic,"This album is really a relic of the era, if you are a fan of sixties psychedelic music you will enjoy it. Casual fans will doubtless find the hippy excesses off putting. Though the album contains mega hits `White Rabbit' and `Somebody To Love' most of the rest of the album is unexceptional. All but die-hards can stick to the comps."
3,I HAVE ONE QUESTION...,"Why has RCA chose to come out with new updated and remastered versions of all of JA's 60's albums except this one!?....which happens to be their best and most classic! The music is great, but because it sounds like it was recorded at the end of a bowling alley, I give this disc a 3....RCA, please wake up!"
5,My favorite album of the 60's,"I'm a big fan of The Doors and Velvet Underground, but it wasn't until recently that I discovered Jefferson Airplane. I had heard ""White Rabbit"" and ""Somebody To Love"" on the radio, however, I just never got around to listening to the rest of their material, I dismissed them as probably being a ""one-hit-wonder"" group... and what a mistake that was. Now I truly love them! Every song is great. I especially like Today, Comin' Back To Me, and She Has Funny Cars. Overall it's a jewel."
2,White Rabbit not 5 minutes,"I ordered this CD specifically because it says the song on track 17, White Rabbit, is 5 minutes long. It is not, it is the same length as the other, about 2:30 min. There is some break after White Rabbit track 17, and an instrumental, but this is not some extended version of White Rabbit."
5,awesome!,This vinyl is amazing. The music sounds so raw on a turn table. awesome album. Jefferson airplane is a psychadelic classic.
5,I have most of everything this band put out and this is their best,"This cd imo the best one they ever put out , it's so melodic and they are bridging folk rock and psych here in a way that sound just incredible. Of course they build on this as they move on into the next decades but here is where they cut loose. I love most of their cds and have everything right up onto the last starship cd. But this one defined a generation probably and lcd hadn't effected them as much as it would later musically as well as mentally.This one was more about just making great music and they succeeded with every song on here , from the hit's like 'white rabbit' to the pretty songs like 'comin back to me' get this one , even if you are not a completist like me you'll love the tunes on here."
4,RA,Glad to find a pair of jeans that is long enough. Why won't the stores in San Fransisco area carry jeans for women with long legs. I bought a pair in Seattle while traveling but came back to the San Francisco bay area and NO store had these in LONG. Macy's actually told me they don't carry the size I need and that they could not order them. Yet Seattle had lots in stock. Even Macy's web site didn't have them. I don't think it's fair that I also have to pay more than other women - I have to pay for shipping and fat chance I could ever find a pair of jeans that fits on sale. Gone are the days of costumer service.
3,These are NOT what I would call skinny jeans,"These are fairly nice quality straight leg jeans, not tapered or even particularly skinny in the leg. The denim is a nice even dark color and they fit true to size, but if you're looking for a clingy, ultra skinny jean, these aren't them LOL. More of a dress jean than I wanted or expected. Even though on the waistband it says skinny, I would call these a slim jean.p.s. they are darker than the picture."
3,Calvin Klein Skinny Jean,I am impressed with the quality of these jeans but they did not meet my expectations of a 'skinny' jean. In Australia a 'skinny' jean would be one which would easily fit inside a boot. These jeans are more like a boot leg cut. The size and colour were fine but not what I purchased them for.
5,great product,my son loves this product and I am disappointed that I was unable to get the pants to go with the shirts but according to the seller lthey were unable to get them.
5,Kickin butt,"These guys are the next Allman Brothers. Great unique sound, the crossover band to unite country boys and rockers. Go see them now in clubs, the word is spreading."
1,poor quality,The wood is cheap jointed pieces pretending to be solid wood. The main frame of the chaise gave way at one of these jointed areas the very first time the chaise was used. I am awaiting a refund. It's a pity because the design of the chaise is very nice and if it had held together it would have been a good buy.
2,Serviceable but don't expect more,"The well known phrase ""you get what you pay for"" certainly applies to this item. It's perfectly serviceable and is quite attractive but the wood is clearly of the cheapest quality and shows signs of splintering and wearing upon arrival. For example, the notches for adjusting the head of the lounge do not work smoothly and you need to give it a hand so to speak to help it settle into position. Not the end of the world but just know in advance that this is not a high quality product but certainly fine for knock-around."
4,"Splinters, anyone?","This is a nice looking lounge, quite comfortable, and the slide-out side table is very convenient. However, the surface of each piece is very rough and can give you a splinter or two while assembling it or lifting the piece to move it. The overall appearance is good, but close up one can see that the wood stain is very inconsistant. For this price, however, I still recommend it."
3,Wish I would of waited...,They look great put together but I haven't even had mine 3 months and where the seat is...its starting to split. I also noticed the splinter thing as did the other viewers. There decent but you get what you paid for. I should of put the money that I spent on these and got teak wood.
3,Size Matters,"I've been shopping for wooden chaise lounges for several months - pottery barn, crate &amp; barrel, discount stores and flea markets - trying to find a good value. I just couldn't see paying upwards of $800 per chair! I was THRILLED when I saw that Target had these chaises online...(including the cushion). We just got the chairs and my husband put them together - they look great - except one small problem - they're like miniature! I'm 5'9 and my husband is 6' and the chairs are not comfortable for us - my calves AND heels hang off the bottom. The other chairs I saw were much larger/more substantial. I didn't even think to look at the dimensions as all other chaises I looked at were comparable in size. Big disappointment... so my search continues.The 3 star rating is because it's a really great value for people who are like 5' tall..."
3,You get what you pay for,"The construction was pieced scrap cedar of varying colors. It seems sturdy enough and the seat back does recline all the way so you can lay flat and take a nap if you want.I plan to sand and paint this item only because there are VERY dark pieces of wood used and staining it would be a waste of time. (When I say dark, I mean almost black).On the plus side, it is VERY comfortable.The instructions were barely adequate, the quality of the cedar was okay and the construction was average. As far as quality for the money, it only gets 3 stars from me. This item is a good value if you must have wood patio furniture."
4,not bad especially for the price!,we typically buy Tidewater Workshops stuff for the deck. We couldn't resist the price of this one though and we were not dissapointed at all. Assembly was pretty simple though there were a couple of misaligned pilot holes. Easy to overlook when you can just drill new ones! Other than that its well worth the small investment.
4,Very satisfied with American Woods Chaise Lounge,"I ordered the lounge on December 19th with the understanding that delivery would be made between December 27-29. Much to my surprise, the lounge arrived in PERFECT condition on December 22!! It was a breeze to assemble (roughly 45 minutes) and is very comfortable. Because the lounge will be used outdoors year round, I gave it three light coats of polyurethane, as the original oil based finish would probably need to be renewed every two months (minimum). In all, I am a very satified customer."
4,Easy to assemble but...,"This chaise lounge was very easy to assemble and is quite comfortable to sit in. As previous reviewers mention, the wood used is very rough. Even though I knew this when I purchased the product, I was disappointed to find one entire side of the main piece to be pitted with large splintered areas. Sanding it wouldn't even help, the wood was that damaged. Luckily this is side that I don't see when I use it - if it had been I would have certainly returned the product. But, for the price, it was worth it."
1,...[Low quality],"I certainly got what I paid for in this instance. Screws were missing from the installation package, the wood has a laquer finish for preservation that makes the chaise an atrocious color. You need to be careful touching the chair as the wood splinters (I pulled two splinters out of my fingers) and once my husband sat on it, the side rail split about 12 inches. ..."
1,What a piece of *%#@,"I bought 2 of these chairs and within 1 season they were ruined. The wood is flimsy. The slats under the area where you sit all split because instead of using whole pieces of wood, they used joined pieces. A 6 year old climbed on the side table and it broke. I feel that this was totally wasted money. Get something else!"
5,Music lover,I too found my first album copy in a used record store during the early 70s. At first the blending of all the instruments was confusing. But then it grew on me. Now this is one of my most treasured CDs. I am familiar with brass instruments and can only marvel at the skill needed to be so creative in their use. This to me is far more creative that Chicago. It also reminds me of a bit of Quick Silver Messenger Service.
5,One of my favorites,"I was browsing a second-hand record shop in the mid 70s and bought this album on the strength of the cover. When I got the record home, I must confess I didn't like it at first listening. It seemed an eclectic jazz/rock blend of horns, sax, guitar and whatever else the band had handy within some fairly bizarre songwriting. But it grew on me - and grew - until it became one of my very favorite albums. When my vinyl copy finally died I was absolutely desperate for a CD - the local record shop tried for 6 months and failed. I can't tell you how relieved I was when I found copies on the internet. If you buy this album and you don't think you like it - don't put it away - keep listening - you'll grow to love it."
1,"Poor acoustics, mediocre performance","If you're on a really tight budget, you may want to settle for this, otherwise there are the real Creation recordings out there by Karajan, Shaw, Bernstein, just to name a few...Don't settle for this. The chorus is too distant and the recording is sort of a mess."
1,Terrible!!,"What a rip-off!! Please be warned that this is simply 2 pieces of driftwood that they have slapped together with a couple of screws and then covered the screws with ample amounts of hot glue that just peel right off. Mine came in a giant box with no packing, so it was broke when it got here. So there are now exposed wood screws. I am going to have to remove all of the hot glue (because my beardie would eat it) and take the screws out (because they are very sharp) and needless to say, broken, it will not stand stable in any way. so I guess I now have 2 very small expensive pieces of driftwood. I will never buy driftwood over the internet again!"
4,Well Done Collection of Vivaldi Concertos,"Looking for an inexpensive but well done Vivaldi concerto collection? One that includes the Four Seasons? One that has concertos for seven instruments? One that has three beautiful choral pieces? One that includes likes of such greats as Pepe Romero, Academny of St.Martin inthe Fields, Heinz Holliger among others?This is it then. Especially enjoy the mandolin concertos (two of them here) and the Two Cellos, as well as Holliger in Oboe work. Also, the Cum Sancto Spiritu is powerful and shows range of this tireless composer who influenced so many and still does. This is nice for someone looking to add a litte Vivaldi to their playing collection. Sheer enjoyment!"
2,Buyer beware,"When I saw a combined album with Rare Earth and Vanilla Fudge I was thinking this is great and was looking forward to hearing. I popped the CD in and track 1 started, and I listened about 20 seconds, and thought maybe I had the wrong CD in. Nope the label was correct, but the song did not sound anything close to what I was expecting. I flipped thru the tracks and the same sounds, even with the Vanilla Fudge tracks. This CD is another one of those 1960 groups who are performing 40 years after they 1st appeared on the scene. The voices and instruments were attrocious. If you are expecting hand picked songs from the original albums, forget it. I tossed the CD in the trash, which I have never done before."
5,Lucky Find,"I use travel guides extensively when I travel. I made a fortunate find in a new Hunter Travel Guide, ""The Alps"" by Krista Dana. It is titled as an adventure guide, yet it is much more than that. We enjoy visiting local festivals and this guide has acquainted us with many festivals throughout the region of the Alps. In addition to a wide variety of physical activities specifically detailed, other types of adventures are highlighted such as unique cable car rides, train journeys, and how to dig deeper into the history of some locales. The history aspect jumped out at me as being unique to this guide in that it gives a brief look at an area's past and its culture. I have found this guide very user friendly for me, with symbols clearly marking each section, candid reviews of places to eat or stay, and contact information for vendors of activities that I am interested in. The ""Adventure Guide to the Alps"" was a lucky find for me, so I thought others might want to know about it, as well."
3,Travel Guide,This is a good book with beautiful photos but somewhat dated. It was useful in providing facts about the sites I saw in Switzerland and Austria.
1,A Painful read...,"The first half of this book plods along, painfully. It jumps from thought to thought more than an ADD-stricken teenager. The language is disjointed and tough to follow. In my opinion, the only steam generated came in the last third. And though I'm an avid reader, it was almost the second book I couldn't finish. (The unabridged version of King's ""The Stand"" holds that honor)"
4,Great Diapers!,I really like these diapers because 1) they have greatly reduced my son's diaper rash 2) they are better on the environment and 3) other namebrand diapers made my hands itch while these don't. I don't miss the other diapers one bit.The one thing I don't like about these is that the elastic around the legs seems to be weaker than other diapers. I've twice been holding him and been peed on because the diaper had pulled away from his leg.
5,"Great fit, no bulk","Our grandson has been using Seventh Generation diapers since birth. They seem thinner and softer than standard disposables, but very secure. The tabs stretch so the fit is custom. Besides being as environmentally friendly as a disposable diaper can be (to be used when cloth is not an option), they are so easy to use and appear to be more comfortable on the baby. I highly recommend them."
5,Great product!,"I love these diapers! They fit great, and they don't have all the perfume and other chemicals that other disposable diapers have. Other than cloth, I will NOT use anything else on my baby."
3,Good concept,"These diapers were purchased in my efforts to maintain an earth-friendly lifestyle of disposables when my little guy isn't wearing his cloth diapers. However, while he wears a size 3 in most other disposable brands with room to grow, the seventh generation size 3 was quite small on him. They tend to be a little more likely to leak also. I love the fastener design and the concept, however."
3,"Good product, IF........","This product, in my opinion, runs small. I was disappointed in that. It held up well enough except, when this diaper is full, it is FULL. It won't take an ounce over. I don't leave my daughter in her diapers very long either, maybe 2 hours. She does drink a LOT of water through the day and therefore pees a lot, but these diapers still did leak a lot. I might try them again in the ""correct size"" which is way over her weight says. I love that they are eco friendly and therefore will give them another shot."
4,Great Green Diaper,"I have been using Seventh Generation diapers on my 4-month-old son almost exclusively since he was born. I did not like the idea of harsh chemicals being up against his sensitive skin, so these were an obvious choice. I have not been disappointed with their performance at all. Yes, he does leak if they have been on all night, but no more than the Huggies he wore when we ran out of the SG for a few days. They seem very comfortable and fit him very well. I am giving them 4 stars because they do leak sometimes, but honestly, it's totally worth the extra diaper change knowing that I'm protecting my child in whatever ways I can from toxic chemicals.I am a firm believer that parents must educate themselves on what to put in and on their children's bodies. Babies can't read labels and they depend on us to do what's best for them. I do not put anything on my son that I don't know the ingredients for, I follow the same standard for his diapers."
3,"Good Product, Bad Quality Control","I really liked the diapers and the environmental aspect, but one whole case was missing the tabs to secure the diapers on my child rendering them useless. I will continue to buy them though in hopes that it was a one time mistake."
5,Great Diapers,These environmentally friendly diapers work great and after using the usual diapers I really enjoy that these are not layden with fragrance.
2,Absolute horror,"We've been using 7th generation diapers for our daughter Alex since the day she was born. Old design is hands down much MUCH much better than the new one. The wider tabs leave horrible red marks on Alex's thighs, the tabs are too wide, the stretchy closure does nothing really. A have to agree they are less bulky, but I don't think it added to the comfort of my baby. She doesn't like diaper changes anymore, and before we started using the new design she really didn't mind them. Now, the size... new stage 2 is easily comparable in size to old S. I have put the two together, and they were practically identical. I put the old M to the stage 2 diaper, and it much MUCH bigger, and the fit is better as well. To those who are looking to try - find the old design and check it out first. SEVENTH GEN - please, bring the old design back!"
4,Vast Improvement,"These new diapers are much more like Pampers and Huggies in design. Now they are flexible and are in smaller sizes, so the fit is fabulous. Thrilled with new design. -- would give 5 stars, but they still use the gel beads."
4,Best disposable for the conscious minded parent,"We use to use G-diapers until they switched to their new ""improved"" style. Which has a horribly large slightly stiff elastic waste band that dug into my daughters belly and would scratch her.We love these diapers; we have never had any leakage problems. But we typically try to change her every 2-3 hours. They are not the best solution if you have a heavy night time wetter. I suggest using a G diaper insert inside the seven gen diaper for night time use. This works very well for my daughter even when she would nurse all night long. (thank goodness we're past that now)We've tried other ""greener"" disposable diapers that are out there and none were as good as these. We use cloth mostly when we're at home but for vacations and outings we use these. They still aren't the best for the environment, but they are much better for your baby and better for the environment then most disposables."
3,Cloth is best. These are better than most diposables.,"I like the Seventh Generation diapers the best out of all disposablediapers. The reason I am giving this product only 3 stars is because other than the fact that they are made without using clorine they are still not biodegradable or made with recycled content. Coming from a company that boasts its concerns with the planets well being for the next seven generations, I just don't think that this is enough. Therefore I have switched mainly to cloth diapers and only use these when I am travelling or need to do a load of diapers. I have twins and believe me, we go through a lot of diapers. Buying this product on Amazon is the best because of the free shipping, the great price and I don't have to drag my 6 month old twins and my 2 year old out to the grocery store.BTW my son just got potty trained!!!. 3 in diapers was a little much.lolSeventh Generation Chlorine Free Diapers, Stage 4 (22-37 Lbs), 34-Count Packages (Pack of 4) (136 Diapers)"
5,very good,"The diapers are almost exactly the same as other brands, but knowing that it has almost no chlorine makes it a winner for me. The only 1 problem I get with it, it is not strechy around baby (like the Huggies), and I can see that my baby sometimes tries to pull them up (maybe they come off?). So make sure you put them tied enough."
3,Problems with leaking!,"These diapers do not hold my breastfed baby's poop. I always end up having to change her cloths due to a leaky diaper. Also, the tabs are the only stretchy part. The side of the diaper the tab is attached to does not give at all creating a gap. The diapers seem to run on the small side as well."
3,Love the diapers but.............,"Beware of buying in bulk. These are the only diapers that I will put on my children. They work great, no leakage, and my child can move freely. Twice now we have received packages where the diapers had the cotton falling out from the seams. In each delivery, you get one box of four packages. In the box, at least one of the packages are defective. I am under the subscription program with Amazon. I do not know if because of the discount we get defective diapers or what. However, whenever I purchase them separately, I have no problems. If you plan on buying in bulk, do some research before you make the purchase."
2,Great in theory...,"PROS:- Environmentally friendly- AffordableCONS:- Gap where front and back of diaper meets allows blowouts at the sides and around the legs (I'm doing 3x as much laundry since switching to these).- Adhesive tabs irritate baby (she fusses every time I put one on her, and she has red marks above her legs where the tabs touch her skin)- Absorbent layer works great on pee, but not so great on poop (which tends to just slide around inside the diaper and make a mess - that is, what poop doesn't blow out the leg openings)I love the idea of biodegradable, environmentally friendly diapers, and I think Seventh Generation is *this* close to having a great product. But they need to address the design of their diaper (adding some waterproof tabs at the top of the leg openings, improving poop handling, and softening the adhesive tabs) before I'll become a convert.For now, it's back to Pampers Swaddlers."
4,great diapers,"I really like these diapers...They are softer for the baby and much less ""crackely"" than regular disposables. The only reason I did not give them a full five stars is the higher price (what will it take to get doing less damage to the environment costing less!?)and the slightly bulkier fit, which was not a problem for me, but might be for some people."
5,These are awesome,"I got these as a shower gift and was skeptical. I waited until all of my other diapers were gone before I opened them. I was so surprised. They work at guarding against leaks better than any other diaper I've used. I keep ordering them. They are great. Just a note, their diapers seem to run a bit small. So, keep that mind if you're fitting really well in a three in another brand, you may need a four in Seventh Gen."
3,"Softest material but ""swelling"" effect","Beyond doubt, these diapers are much softer than Huggies (rough) and has no odd odor like Pampers. However the problem is that the volume of the diaper is already quite big to start with, and once it is soaked, it enlarges like a rising dough such that it always wakes up my baby from his sleep. This forces me to switch to Huggies or Pampers at nap times and eventually giving up on this diaper altogether (too much trouble to manage 2 types of diapers). What a pity!"
4,A good option if you are after an environmentally aware disposable diaper,"I've never really used Pampers or Huggies brand diapers, but I have tried a lot of different 'eco-friendly' brands, both here and abroad. When re-usables stopped being a viable option for me I needed to find a disposable that soothed my conscience. Seventh Generation seems to tick most of the boxes - it's absorbent, soft against the delicate baby bits, and I've never had any leaking problems... and my daughter is prone to 'blaster-poops'. The price is reasonable too, especially if you buy in bulk. There are other brands out there that are more environmentally friendly, but I haven't found one yet that provides me with the same level of performance."
2,Disappointed,"As a working mother who needs disposable diapers I was thrilled to find what looked like a promising replacement for other brand name diapers. BUT, every diaper has leaked. The result has been increases in laundry. So the savings to the earth from lack of bleache go away with the increased water consumption. not to mention the messes on my clothes when I pick my son up with a leak. I won't be buying these again.Cause of leaks- the absorption material doesn't have all the coverage of my usual brand- Huggies. Back to Huggies I go."
2,More leaks than a New Orleans levee,"I bought these for my son in a smaller size when he was a newborn and they worked fine but these ones leak all over the place, they're terrible! He's 21lbs and these are supposed to work from 16 up to 28lbs, not a chance. Disappointing because I like that they are unbleached, that's the reason they got two stars instead of one."
4,Diapers Galore,"I just love Seventh Generation products! I have used them for over 13 years and since we adopted our now 16 month old son Seventh Generation diapers is all he has warn. Why do we need to have our diapers white when the Chlorine only pollutes our waters and iritates our skin. The only reason I gave it a 4 out of 5 is that the new style, with the elastic, leaves a gel residue on my son, which never occured with the older style. If they could bring back the old absorbant material my rating would definetly go up to a 5."
2,"Diapers are sized too small, cause leaks and diaper rash!","I have these diapers in size 1 and 2. They were both too small for my average sized baby, cause major leaks. I tried the entire pack of size one and they never seemed to fit correctly and also gave my baby diaper rash. He is currently 13 pounds and the size twos look way too tiny! The tabs cut into his legs even when I try to pull the diaper up more. I do not like these diapers. If you are looking for an eco-friendly diaper, I recommend gDiapers. I will not use these diapers again."
1,bad batch--leaked everytime,"i usually purchase these from a store but thought maybe cheaper online. the first time i used them they leaked, i didn't think about it, but everytime they leaked. i checked them and realized the crotch area was not wide enough, the padding on the sides didn't reach to the edges. so i ended up throwing them away. what a disappointment!"
3,"Seventh (7th) Generation, size 3+ diapers","7th Generation diapers did not work for us with our 1st child because we thought we had started to use them too late and that they just couldn't absoorb a 2 yr old's output. So, when our boy was born, we tried them immediately and were thrilled with the results ... until he got to the size 3 at @8.5mos.The bottom line is that if you are ""on it"" and change the diaper the moment it is wet or dirty, things are ok. Otherwise these diapers leak and you end up changing clothes & bedding. So, we use 7th Generation for day and Pampers for night. Quite frankly, with the number of 7th Generation diapers we go thru to keep them from leaking, I'm really not sure that we are doing anything ""for"" the environment at all."
2,Disappointed,"It is hard to believe that people report no leaks! I was so enthusiastic about getting these chlorine-free diapers that are environmentally friendly and better for my baby. However, I cannot wait to get this big box finished since I have to change my baby's clothes at least once a day for leaking reasons. It is very annoying since having to do more laundry does not help reduce the human impact on the planet. I am definitely going back to the P diapers that are so efficient. What a shame."
4,Nice product,We like the product but we just wish it could any cheaper compared to the other mainstream brands.
4,"Great stuff overall (4,5 stars really)",I gave 4 stars for couple of reasons:- sometimes diapers had glue on the inside- happen to get lopsided ones too.So Seventh Generation better take care of the quality.Good thing:- never had reaction to the diapers- looks to be comfortable
5,Great Diaper,"These diapers work as well as national, bleached brands. Once I figured out cloth diapers, much to my dismay, were not going to work for us I sought out the next best thing. I did very briefly have the issue like another reviewer of the tabs making a mark on the baby's leg. A simple adjustment upward solved that problem. These diapers don't leak and my baby's bottom remains free and clear of any rash."
4,good option for disposables,"I like the light brown color and they are not too stiff (WAY better than 365 (Whole Foods brand) chlorine-free diapers). However, they tend to clump up when wet, so leaks can happen without frequent changes. But frequent changes are healthier anyway. I like that they're biodegradable and scent-free. Babies R Us just started carrying them and I hope other stores follow suit, but I think the ""subscription"" option through Amazon is the best value!"
3,"The new tabs are not an ""improvement""","We have happily used Seventh Generation diapers for 20 months now, on our two daughters. I was excited at first when I saw the ""new and improved"" design, but that thrill soon faded. The stretchy tabs simply don't hold. I don't know what they're made of, but they just don't stay sealed. After a week of changing sheets each morning, I've reluctantly switched to non-environmentally-friendly diapers that will actually stay on my child. What a disappointment!"
4,Okay,The tabs are now too easy to be undone which is a drawback. I like that the diapers are eco friendly and unbleached. I do have a problem however with the gel crystals leaking out of the diaper and getting all over it is really gross. I did find that the size 4 do not fit as well as other size 4 diapers these actually fit like a size 3 rather small...
3,New and Improved???,"The ""new and improved"" diaper in my opinion is not better. I prefer the old version to the new ones. The only improvement I have found is that the new diaper is not as bulky as the older version. The new diaper tab does not stick very well and it keeps coming off or sticks to my son's clothes. I have to use packing tape over the tab to make sure it stays on. I notice that the new diapers leak more and they also, leave behind a gel substance on my son's skin which the older version didn't. I would not continue to buy these diapers if it wasn't for the fact that these diapers are chlorine free and free of many other chemicals that the commercial name brand diapers have. I will continue to purchase these diapers however; I am disappointed in the ""new and improved"" version and I hope they are working on making them better."
5,Great alternative to regular (bleached) diapers,"We chose to use Seventh Generation diapers when our son was born. We read about the use of chlorine in diapers and the dangers of it and decided that we would try an unbleached option. We have been using these ever since. He is now 2 1/2 and wears the size 6. We love these diapers. They work great. They don't leak as long as you change them before they are too saturated (just like with any diaper). We recommend them and feel relieved knowing that even though we didn't go the ""healthiest"" avenue with cloth diapers we have taken a good step in making a healthier choice for our son. They are definitely worth a try!"
5,Comfy for baby and holds everything in.,"We love these diapers, and feel good about them being more eco-friendly than other disposables. We've never had an issue with diaper rash, probably because these are hypoallergenic and don't contain chlorine. We did a lot of diaper research, and these are not only the best for earth and baby, but with the Amazon subscription program, also one of the cheapest options. I love that they come right to the door, no shipping, no tax."
5,7th Generation Diapers are Great!!,"These diapers are excellent quality. They do the job they are supposed to do, yet are chlorine free and do not leave the ""crystals"" on baby's bottom like the conventional diapers. Our son had no real diaper rash issues until we ran out of the 7th Gen and had to get some conventional while waiting for 7th Gen to come in - within a day he had irritation on his bum! They may not have the ""cool"" designs like the others, but I highly reccomend them - it is the right thing to do for your baby and the right thing to do for the environment."
4,great for sensitive skin,"I bought these on a whim and I'm very pleased -- my 6 month old has sensitive skin and the chronic diaper area skin irritation he had with pampers has disappeared. In addition, the back is stretchy/elasticized and we have had no problems with poo leaks. I also like the lack of the artificial smell that comes with conventional diapers. Furthermore I love that the diapers are just plain brown instead of covered with cartoon characters. I docked one star because rarely one of the diapers will have something wrong with the tabs (one diaper out of a case of four bags)."
3,nice plain diaper,"I like these because they don't have ANY designs on them (what happened to nice plain white diapers!>!>!) and they don't have any of those awful fragrances on them. They are as good as regular diapers in term so of absorbency, etc... because they have the same absorbent powder in them as regular diapers- the only eco thing about them is that they are produced without chlorine bleach. The only way to make these less expensive is to get the amazon subscription, which makes them the same cost as buying other name brand in the supermarket.Although I do buy these, it is only for cosmetic reasons- ie looks and smell! My son still has blow outs and occasionally leaks in these but he also has done so with all the other brands we have tried. Nothing is perfect!"
4,Good value,"Amazon provides a good value and convenience with these diapers. The diapers are chlorine free, and used at times when convenience is a factor (normally we use washables when at home). I have purchased them in smaller quantities at local retailers, but it is a better bargain to buy the lot through Amazon."
3,good but not easy to use,"I like the fact that these are chlorine free and use recycled materials. I don't like that they look fuzzy like an old worn sweater after only an hour of use. I especially don't like that the tabs lie under the baby when you have it open underneath to put on the diaper. In other words, you put the diaper under first, then when you want to go open the tabs you have to pull up your baby to reach under, which is really cumbersome when your baby doesn't like to lie still for a change (i.e. when they're over 9 months)."
5,No more rash,My son would continually get a diaper rash. We couldn't figure it out. Finally I saw this brand of diapers at Whole Foods and tried them. In about a week the rash went away and he hasn't had one since. If you have any doubts research on google all the junk they put in regular commercial diapers. Amazon is cheaper than WFoods and offers free shipping. Great buy.
3,Disappointed with these,"I love the Seventh Generation wipes and was really looking forward to these diapers for my baby. Although I think they fit a lot better than ""regular"" diapers, I find that they don't ""breathe"" as well. My son has sensitive skin and he always starts to get irritated every time I try to use these again. Once I go back to Pampers, everything is great. It's too bad because I love Seventh Generation products but I feel like these don't allow my baby's skin to breathe."
2,Previous design better,"I found an 'older version' stash of the same size 7thG diapers in the back of my closet. It was the 2T training pants. Now I can say for sure the older version holds more, and leaks a lot less. Also, becuase Diapers.com and Amazon charges tax, it's almost the same price to buy them at the grocery store, and $13+ per pack is not worth it at all. After three+ years of using these diapers, I am switching brands. Really disappointed with the new style. I would rather have the not-so-corpratized 'Trees and 1,2,3s' version over the Lorax version any day. They really sold out IMO."
2,Too small/short,"I found these diapers to be too small - and yes, I was using the sizing guide. For my little guy (currently 10 lbs and 22 in) they are just a tad too short. I actually found Earth's Best to be the better alternative."
4,Great! (but slight leakage problem),"These diapers are great--they are better than the Huggies i used to be loyal to, with a softer feel and no annoying ink transfers onto the clothes. The only difference is that they lack the double row of gathers, which does help to control leakage a bit more for (attention, graphic diaper descriptions to follow!) the extra big/runny no. 2's and 2nd or 3rd pees."
2,Leaky...,"I really wanted to like these diapers. I use Fuzzy Bunz cloth diapers on my 2 year old most of the time, but I use disposables for ""out and about"" and for night time. Before Seventh Generation, I always bought Pampers Cruisers, which are locally made for me.The two problems with this diaper are that it's very leaky. I always have to change my son's clothes. And it rubs strangely on my son's thighs and gives him a rash.Another more ""environmental"" problem is when you work out how much CO2 is released in getting these to me (I can't buy them locally) as opposed to purchasing locally made Pampers, I really don't think they're much more of an environmentally friendly option.After this case is finished, we will switch back to Fuzzy Bunz with Pampers alternative."
5,"as good as any, better than most","This is a solid product and we haven't had any problems with them over a year's time using them regularly (in conjunction with cloth diapers). In that time, we've not had any problems with leakage which is more than i can say for other pamper-type diapers. So you're getting both biodegradability and a well-functioning diaper here!"
5,Great Diapers!,"They work great, I like them. The fact that they are Chlorine free makes me feel even better about using them on my son. Don't forget to recycle the plastic bag where they come in!Luna y Sol."
5,These are the best diapers,"I was worried that because these diapers are better for the environment, that they wouldn't work as well. These work exactly like Huggies and Pampers except that my son doesn't get a rash from the poisons and bleach they put in Huggies and Pampers. They are just as absorbent and I've been using them for a year. They are great for my son, and much better for the environment."
1,Leaks every time,"I really wanted these diapers to work. I've been using the Kirkland diapers and these are not much more expensive and so much better for baby and the environment; but if I have to change baby's cloths every time I change diapers, then it's not better for either. I was really careful to be sure I had them on as good as possible, but no matter what I did, they leaked. I have problems with the Kirkland diapers at night some times, getting him wet, but never during the day and NEVER poop, like I had with these. Maybe they'd be better for girls, or very slender babies, I don't know, but for my boy, they just do not work at all. If you want to try them, I suggest signing up for the auto ship so you can get the best price, but schedule your next shipment for several months down the line, you can always change the ship times if you like the diapers and it gives you time to cancel if they don't work out for you."
1,Defective items,"I ordered 4 boxes and one box cantinas pack of 4 and i think almost every packs are all defective. The waist band are too short, so it is hard to grab and detach (i compared the same diapers (same size) which were bought at the whole food store and their diapers are all good). Also, randomly in a pack, there is a hard small grain on one of the end of the waist band which makes my baby hurts and cries. i wonder if i can return some of the left. anyway i won't buy seventh generation chlorine free diapers thru amazon.com again since they are not in good condition or defective. this is a good product, but I am really disappointed this item from your store."
4,Almost perfect,"This diaper is the best we have found. It holds everything, fits baby very well, and we love that there is no chlorine. However, that is really the only eco-friendly thing about them."
4,Great no-frills diaper,My daughter is allergic to all other disposable diapers due to something in the processing. These are the only ones she can use without breaking out in a terrible rash! I only wish they had a pullups variety!
4,The best 'natural' alternative to regular diapers,"I must admit that I think I liked these a little better before they 'reformulated' them, but they're still the only disposable diaper I'll buy. They beat Pampers and Huggies hands-down. I've never had a leak or a blow out using Seventh Generation. Love the fact that they're chlorine free - who wants chlorine is such close proximity to their kids skin?? Just wish they were a little more environmentally friendly - biodegradable would be great!"
2,Disappointed,"I really wanted to like these diapers. I bought a small pack to test them out because I do feel guilty using the mainstream brands. Not only did they leak out of the legs and waistband, but a couple of times they leaked right through the diaper itself. Such a disappointment. Definitely NOT overnight diapers or even long naps. And, because they don't absorb moisture that well, my son ended up with diaper rash. After having too many leaks and a red bottom, I ended up just getting rid of the rest of the pack."
2,Tabs are too big to be comfortable,"I picked these diapers because they were chlorine free and I like most of Seventh Generation's other products. Overall, they were good and didn't leak. However, the tabs to close the diapers are 2-3 inches wide, and would dig into my baby's skin on her stomach and thighs any time she sat down. Maybe it was just an issue of fit for her, but we switched brands because of this problem."
3,Seemed like factory seconds...,The gathering around the legs was uneven and seemed to be responsible for leaking. This was true for nearly all diapers in all four bags of diapers in the shipment. Lower quality than I usually find seventh generation diapers to be from grocery store. I will buy from my regular grocery in the future.
4,I like these diapers,I like the thought that these diapers is environmental friendly. Is affordable and my 1 month old son don't got any diaper rash so far!But sometime this diapers can be leak if it not change immediately!
5,Contains 'blowouts' well!,"Great product, fits really well and seems to contain 'blowouts' better than other brands that we have tried. Being environmentally friendlier you also do not feel so bad using them."
5,Seventh Generation Size 4 Diapers,These diapers are just as good as other brand names; but have the advantage of peace of mind in knowing there are no harmful chemicals touching your babys skin. Very comfortable. I definitely recommend these diapers.
1,"watch out for the tabs, ouch!","Similar story. We used the old style, loved them. We bought cases of the new style and are very disapointed. If your child is crying and you can't figure out what's wrong, check the diapers. The closure tabs have very sharp corners that will cut babies thigh and belly. We contacted Seventh Generation and they are aware of the problem and will be releasing an updated style mid-summer. ):"
2,sub-standard performance!,"I really had high hopes for these diapers. I bought them based on other reviews. I wanted to originally start using cloth diapers to be environmentally friendly but my little one poops and pee's so often at 8 weeks that I wouldn't be able to keep up with the laundry. I decided that these diapers would be the best of both worlds- environmentally friendly and disposible. To my dismay, 10 out of 14 diapers leaked both poop and pee. My baby sleeps with me on his own little pad and his pee leaked through the diaper, through the pad and onto my mattress. I tried folding the top in to catch excess, I made sure the elastic bits were properly positioned, and I made them tighter and nothing worked. I'm super bummed that I have to go back to pampers until I find another alternative. Maybe my baby is just made differently than those who rave about this product. I gave 2 stars because I liked the color and materials used."
5,WORTH THE MONEY +,MY GRANDSON KEPT A REAL BAD CASE OF DIAPER RASH FROM BIRTH UNTIL WE FOUND THESE DIAPERS. HE COULD NOT WEAR ANY BRAND OF DIAPERS AND WAS AT THE DOCTORS OFFICE CONSTANTLY BECAUSE HIS RASH WOULD GET SO BAD. WE KEPT HIM CLEAN AND COULD NOT FIGURE IT OUT. AFTER SWITCHING TO THE SEVENTH GENERATION DIAPERS NO MORE DIAPER RASH!!!HIGHLY RECOMMEND THESE!!!
2,major leakage problems with size 3,"I have used seventh generation diapers since my baby was born- in size 1 and size 2, and they were great. I love that they are unscented and have no icky chemicals. However, once my daughter grew into size 3, we began having MASSIVE leakage problems. Not once or twice, but atleast 10 times- I'm talking poo running down her legs. It wasn't even as though there was a lot of it- I was in denial at first thinking ""maybe I'm just putting these on wrong?!"" but really, how many ways can you put on a diaper? I'm so sad that these leak so badly, I feel like I have to choice but to switch brands."
2,Not so green,"I picked up a pack of these diapers at my local coop and loved the cloth-like feel and the fact that they were more environmentally friendly. When I saw them on Amazon I stocked up. However my experience with these was totally different. They feel cheaper (more plastic) and the velcro kept falling off the tabs. Out of the 192 diapers I received, at least 25 were useless. I even tried to tape some closed. I still haven't heard from the company about this issue, so I won't ever buy these again."
4,First time user,This is my first time using Seventh Generation products. I bought this mainly because it is environment friendly and I wanted to see if there was a difference in the way the diaper holds compared to the regular Huggies brand that I buy. It got my seal of approval and I will be buying this product again.
5,Excellent,"These diapers are fabulous! My husband says they are better than the leading brands. (Huggies,Pampers) They have stretchy closures much like that of Huggies. They don't leak and can take as much volume as the leading brands(if not more). They are not bulky and seem to be a comfy fit. Not only that, they aren't bad for your baby or the environment."
2,Old style WAS better,The old style diapers were the first we tried where our daughter would not rash. I agree the old style was better. I don't know why they changed. My daughter just leaks through these new ones. The old ones actually held liquid. It's a toss up whether to try to use these new ones with our new child or whether to switch to a major brand like huggies.
4,7th Generation Diapers,"So far have used 0, 1 & 2 size. All have preformed well and fit tightly with very few leaks."
4,"pretty good, but...","Other diapers we tried, pampers or hugguies, were leaking often times to my son. So, we tried this one and it never leaked. The only problem is it doesn't have good air flow, so we're considering to go back to pampers just for summer time."
5,Great product,I am very pleased with this product and enjoy the convenience of having them shipped to my residence.
5,Excellent natural choice,I have used these since my now 19 month old was born and haven't had a problem. The only time they leak was when she was close to needing the next size and then we just moved her up. We had diaper rash problems with scented diapers and have never had a an issue since switching. I am really happy with this product and the price on amazon is great.
5,best diapers ever!,"I've tried huggies, pampers, luvs, but none are as good as these! My 4 month old makes it through the night in these without waking up to be changed. I tried to switch to pampers swaddlers to see if the same would happen with them - nope! She woke up screaming from being wet every night I used them. I switched back to seventh generation, and she's sleeping soundly again. Her sleeping and my sanity are worth the extra few cents per diaper! Hope this helps!"
5,Great diaper,A great alternative to disposable diapers that contain chlorine. The diaper has a slightly stugger fit than Huggies.
3,"Great diaper, but a rash...","I decied that with my fourth child I would use disposable diapers, vs the cloth we use for the other three. As soon as we started using these diapers she developed a rash, I couldn't figure it out and tried every cream or lotion know to man to get rid of it. I found that baby powder worked the best but still wouldn't make it go completly away. I finaly tried a different diaper and the rash cleared up instantly, and hasn't reapeared since. It is a great diaper, but my daughter had a sensitivity to it. (and it was the first time I heard of any one having an issue with this type of diaper) I would recomend only buying a small package first and then going the bulk diapers to see how your baby's bottom does first. :)"
5,Very Very Nice,These were nice diapers. Most other diapers didn`t fit our son when he was born because he had a big tummy and no butt so they would fall off(like the pampers the hosipital sent home w/us) and it would be a mess but these were nice and snug and fit him wonderfully.
5,Excellent diapers,"We just love these diapers. They are very absorbant and rarely leak, even overnight (12 hours). I also feel better that they are non-chlorinated for baby and the environment. We don't use anything else!"
3,"Great idea, but the diapers fell short","My wife and I were very excited about these diapers for our newborn. We wanted to be as environmentally conscious as possible while keeping things fairly easy.Anyway, out of the three different diapers we've used, these were sadly our least favorite. They are very small for Size 1's; the straps are remarkably short. They also don't block odors or keep in waste very well. All things considered, we ended up switching to another brand.It's disappointing; with a few small tweaks, these diapers could be so much better."
2,Tabs Dig Into Legs,"I so wanted to like this diaper. It had so much going for it on the surface- good for baby (gentle product on skin) good for the environment (chlorine-free). However, the tabs are really quite large and dig into my baby's legs. I've tried other sizes, still no luck. I do hope Seventth Gen. will come up with a better design, as I've seen we aren't the only ones who have experienced this problem. Until then, back to Pampers."
1,"IT LEAKS, wouldn't recommend it","If someone pays me to use it, I wouldn't use itWe've never experienced so many leaks.... We had high expectations, but no matter how tight we wrapped our baby in this diaper, it just didn't work....The diapers are very THIN, and they feel very mushy after it's been wet."
3,Not perfect but better than others,Not a perfect diaper but I prefer it over other brands because the fastener stretches. They just seemed so much easier to put on. Spouse did not like the color.
4,Great Diaper,"Love these diapers- less toxic than a traditional diaper, yet my daughter can still wear them overnight without any leaks which is rare in a ""healthier"" diaper!"
5,Saving the world one diaper at a time.,The words on the package are very motivating to be using these diapers. They work great for my little one and do not irritate her at all.
3,A little too small...,"I love that the seventh generation diapers are chlorine free and better for the environment. What I don't like is that it seems that my baby grows out of them very quickly. (I bought size 3 for a 20 pound baby. Size 3 supposedly goes to 28 lbs.) From the last shipment that we received, we used one package before the diapers leaked horribly. Also, our baby is a heavy wetter so we have not been able to use the diapers at night. I will say that seventh generation diapers are great for healing and preventing diaper rashes. Once she gets a rash, I use these diapers and it clears up in a day. Overall this is a good diaper, I have just gotten frustrated with the leaks."
4,Liked the old model better,"In 2005, Seventh Generation changed the manufacturer of their diapers. We liked the old style better, but have found a solution in ordering the next size up from what you think you should order. It's a semi-green product - still has gels, but one of the better choices.In Toronto, the city now picks up disposable diapers with the recycling!"
1,Too rough for baby bottom,"I found Seventh Generation diapers to be too rough for my baby. I had only used two of them, and the skin on the sides of his bottom peeled off."
4,"Very absorbent, sometimes a little leaky","I started my 9-pounder on the Stage 1 and I really liked them but them when I went up to Stage 2, I thought they were pretty leaky. I set them aside and then recently went back to them now that he is bigger, and I think they are great again. In particular, they do seem to be more absorbent overnight than Huggies. Plus, I like the tabs on them - they are softer than most other brands we've tried. I think that like most diapers, different ones work for different shaped babies but these are easily as good as any of the other name brands."
5,Excellent product for babies with sensitive skin,"My baby had a pretty bad allergic reaction to regular diapers, so I gave this one a try. It was just a matter of days until the redness on her skin disappeared. This is the only diaper she uses now."
5,Best diapers on the market,"After our preemie baby came home from the hospital with diaper rash we started trying different brands. Most of them leaked and the diaper rash continued. We tried Seventh Generation and to our pleasure, no leaks and the diaper rash cleared. We have been loyal customers for the last year with no plans of switching. After our son turned 1 we noticed some leaking at night, but that was solved by using the next size larger for night time wear. I hope they come out with swim diapers too!"
5,The best diaper if you can't do cloth diapers,"We originally wanted to do cloth diapers, but it was too time consuming and stinky! We wanted to find the most environmentally friendly disposable and Seventh Generation is it. We feel good knowing that we aren't exposing our baby to dioxin (Google it to learn more).The diapers work great and the tabs seem to be working fine for us.No leaks and good for your baby and the environment. You can't ask for more than that!"
4,Good product,"They fit great, rarely any leaks, I feel good about purchasing the chlorine free diapers. No perfume smell."
4,Good diapers!,"They work very well! Pampers cruisers leave a gel on my daughter so we went with these. I have used them for several months. Very similiar in size to cruisers size 3. The only thing I don't like is the fastener tab.It is bigger than other brands . It has to be positioned just right so it won't irritate her skin. Other than that, they are great."
5,"great diapers, environmentally friendly","I usually use cloth diapers through a diaper service, however when traveling or in a pinch, I love these diapers. I am happy that they are unbleached and they work as well as the best disposables I have used (I have 3 children). I highly recommend these if you have to use disposables."
2,Write to Seventh Generation to switch back!,"I agree, the new design sucks. I've written the company with my opinion and I think enough people write to complain, they might go back to the old design. It can't hurt to try. Remember the when Coke introducted New Coke - people complained so much they brought the old formula back.I loved the old diapers and now they are a gloried expensive Luvs or Pampers. It's not worth paying the extra money.Seventh Generation's website is recycle@seventhgeneration.com"
3,Cost Cutting Redesign,"The new design of these diapers has probably only improved the product's profit margin, not my baby's gluteal comfort and hygeine. We agree with the other reviews listed here: we miss the old style.The new style is thinner, has leaked (the old ones never did for us), and now they leave little gel beads on the baby (like other, cheaper varieties) where the old style never did. Odor is also much more apparent when the baby is wet - the old style was much better at keeping smells in.We were happy to pay the premium on the five-star-worthy older style, but we've been much less loyal now that they're so similar to other mainstream brands we can get at the local megamart."
1,I really wanted to like these,"My wife and I purchased the STAGE 1 diapers and were very happy with them. We moved on to STAGE 2 when our son got bigger and they were a disaster. They leaked every time. Day and night. Not just a little. He was soaking wet each time. We switched to another brand and had no issues. More recently, we wanted to give these another shot and purchased the STAGE 3 diapers. Unfortuneately same results as STAGE 2. They leaked each time. We have a large amount of unused STAGE 2 and STAGE 3 diapers left. They are useless. I really wanted these to work. These seem to work for a lot of people; however there are a few reviewers who had the same results as we did. I suggest buying a small pack first to see if they work for you before investing in a large pack. Good luck."
1,"Good idea... ""leaky"" execution","While the idea of a less ""fake stuff"" and more ""environmental friendly"" diaper is appealing, it's only worth it if it actually works... I switched from pampers cruisers to the seventh generation about 3 months ago. My son constantly leaks through the sides of the seventh generation leaving his clothes soaked, no matter how frequently I change his diaper. I really wanted to like these diapers and even tried different sizes, but no matter what, they're just plain old leaky... I don't recommend these diapers."
3,"Comme ci, comme a.","Buy a size up. Yes it keeps the diaper rash at bay (Lasinoh Wipes and Dr Smiths Diaper Cream keep the rash away with ANY diaper, promise)... But, I am not longer going to use these diapers. One, they are two cents more each than Pampers. Two, my daughter is breastfed.. and these diapers can't seem to really keep the poop and pee from leaking out. I'm pretty adamant about changing her, so its the diapers, not me lol.The fit is weird. The product doesn't have wings on the velcros so the straps dig into my daughters sides a little. I don't know, they just didn't work for us. I love that their odorless, but will gladly go back to the wreak parfum of pampers to avoid blowouts and leaks.I wish these diapers and my baby could of had a better relationship."
5,Great diaper!,"Great diaper! 7th Generation makes a great other option when trying to decide about diapers. No chlorine helps the environment and your baby's sensitive skin. And the sides are tight with the inner and outer elastic- no problems with leaks. We've been really happy. Amazon gives good prices too, especially with delivery discount."
5,Review,"These are great, they were a much better fit for my baby than the several other brands i tried, besides the fact that they are chlorine free. Her diaper rash was reduced drastically and now i need to occasionally use a diaper rash creme in the night only. They don't leak either !"
5,These diapers are the best,I have been using these diapers for 8 months. I would never use anything else. They don't leak. They are better for the enviornment and they don't have silly cartoons on them.
3,Give it time ....,"I don't really know what to think of this book. It's not what I expected in relation to ""emotional anatomy"". Its not about somatics. Its a big book with big drawings and a description to these drawings. Its not for beginners. Its about the tubes, layer and pumps in the body and how these change depending on life's experiences which in this book are nearly all negative. I think this book is an acquired taste and with time I will understand it."
5,Psychological thriller with a surprise ending,"Ex-FBI agent turned private investigator, Alex Rourke, is called back to his hometown of Winter's End, Maine by old friend, Sheriff Dale Townsend to help solve a murder of a woman found lying dead on a dark roadway. A young man wielding knives sits besides her naked corpse. The man refuses to give his name and to answer any questions. Rourke is an expert interrogator, but suspect is more adept at playing mind games than he could have imagined. Rourke struggles as he confronts his own demons brought into the forefront by this mysterious suspect who has too much personal knowledge of him.WINTER'S END was an engrossing page-turner from the very first page; a very hard book to put down. The plot while not exactly realistic, was intricately plotted and very suspenseful. An excellent debut novel to what hopefully will become a series."
2,Playing by the rules,"As an avid reader of mystery and crime novels I was happy to stumble upon a new author in this area. The description on the back sounded interesting enough. Ex-FBI Agent Alex Rourke gets called down to his New England hometown to help the local sherrif with a puzzling murder case. Unfortunately, the author writes his book by the rules, sticking to a predictable plot carried out by one-dimensional characters. None of the so-called plot twists are surprising, and the outcome of the novel becomes clear about half-way through.It has to be said that the writing is decent and made the book an enjoyable read despite all its shortcomings. If Rickards works on his characterization and plotline, he might yet write a great book."
5,I LOVE IT!,"I am part of a small brass band and provide part of the background rhythm. I used a friends Guiro and really loved playing it, so I was looking for one, this one was PERFECT! It has a great sound from both sides and is fun to play, not to mention, it is a wonderful addition to our group.....thank You Amazon for listing this wonderful instrument!"
5,Perhaps the BEST work of Kris Kristofferson,"To the Bone, is perhaps one of Kristoffersons' best works as a singer/songwriter. The songs on this album are written and performed from the heart, with feelings and emotions seldom seen from Kris. Of all of Kris's albums, THIS ONE RANKS AS MY ALL-TIME FAVORITE. You will not be dis-appointed!"
1,Boring unless you' r an actor.,"Boring as hell!Heard about this great work by O'Neill for years and finally got to read it. Maybe this makes a decent play. Maybe if you sit and watch you canenjoy the performances and emotions, etc.But reading is bruatally boring.On and on and on....Maybe I am conditiioned by TV and movies for getting to the point alot faster."
2,Long Day's Journey Into Boredom,"Convinced by my computer teacher to read this play, I checked it out in the library and read it in within days. The result: A very dissatisfied reader.Something like this won the Pulitzer Prize? If any of his plays should have won it (which a couple of them did), it should have been All God's Chillun Got Wings, not this pointless play.The family in this play was MUCH too dysfunctional. All they did all day (which the whole play was in one day) was argue and argue and argue. And when at times it seemed as if the arguing would end, one of the four characters said something that would spark up a new argument.Woe be to my computer teacher for suggesting me this book, for it bore me into tears."
1,Shallow and Uneventfully Dull,"Why, pray tell, is this play so revered? It isthe most boring, over-hyped, and predictable playI have ever encountered. If you don't know everything that will happen by page five,there is something seriously wrong with you. Ifit were written particularly well, I could give itsome slack--but, REALLY! Save your money and readsome Tennessee Williams, who really IS America'sgreatest playwrite."
4,O'Neil highlights the basics human nature.,"It's a wonderfully sad story about the struggles of a family's struggles. In each of the characters you can feel a hint of yourself, and you feel the true pain of each of them. O'Neill's writing makes you feel like you are really there, which might might not be the place that you want to be. It's extremely sad and depressing, but abolutely wonderful."
2,Im not happy with this product,The book delivered was not the same as the one advertised. The cover was different and was not in good condition. I ended up going to my school library to buy another one to replace. False picture of the textbook
4,Depressive,"It's a gloom play with conversations full of anger, rage and sarcasm, grief and sorrow. It's the story of a family whose members have lost every connections between each other, four characters that desperately seek a last vestige of love to be confronted only with disappointment in the end. It's an autobiographical play, too. I read the book late at night, sometime after midnight had passed, along with a couple of cigarettes and some wine. And it really got me. The feeling of being detached from everything else, to be utterly alone with yourself and the thoughts of your mind, it crept more and more on me with every page I turned. These are genuine wounds that bloom before our eyes like the flowers of torment and sometimes I meant to even hear the echo of the cries of the hurt when my heart beat faster. But if one doesn't want to open up to the sinister and absolutely melancholic atmosphere of the book I can well understand that..."
5,excellent edition of classic play,"Bloom's introduction frames this American masterpiece with precision and insight. In my opinion, O'Neill's best play, Long Day's Journey Into Night is better read than performed as the nuance and poetry of his stage direction and descriptions of gestures are what make this play extraordinary. A dark and depressing book, it accurately depicts the ravages of addiction and its impact on the family."
2,"Long, Dull Read","Wow, what a depressing and dull read. I cannot imagine what it would have been like to actually sit there and watch this on a stage. I appreciate the style O'Neill brought with him when it came to details. That was really unusual and interesting. However, none of the characters were even somewhat likable and the story was so depressing. After reading this I am much more grateful for my family. We have our problems but nothing like this. I think it is worthwhile to take a look at this play because O'Neill's style is so different, but don't be surprised if you hate it."
3,This album deserves more stars for musicianship,"I only wanted to rate this album a mere ONE star, but the Ytse Jam gave the album a certain sense of purpose. The singer on the record is horrid. (sorry to say-no I'm not) Thank God they found James."
3,for DT fans only,"DT's first album was somewhat developmental in nature. While some of the stylistic elements can already be heard (particularly on the instrumental YTSEJAM, a perennial DT favorite), DT (particularly keyboardist Kevin Moore) were still trying to find their way. The hopelessly mismatched singer (James LaBrie first appears on the following album ""Images and Words"") does not help one bit. This is definitely better described as hard rock with louder keyboards than as progressive rock or even prog-metal.""The killing hand"" is quite a powerful track ---if somewhat too repetitive for my taste --- and there are nice bits scattered across other cuts (aside from the aforementioned YTSEJAM).If you're a DT fan you'll want to have this for the sake of completeness. If Europe's ""The final countdown"" is your thing, you may actually like this album. Otherwise, *any* other DT studio album --- even the much-maligned ""Falling into infinity"" --- is a much better buy."
4,Bad vocals,"I agree with some people here. I got used to LaBrie's vocals and Dominici's vocals came as shock. Sorry but when compared to LaBrie they really suck. Although music is very cool. By the way, my fave album is Awake."
4,I'm glad they finally released this one in the US.,"I had to buy it as an import. This stage of D-Ts development shows their strong influence by Rush, early singer Charlie Dominici's vocals being only the most obvious clue. But the road they chose heads in the direction of more instrumentals and mid-size songs (7-11 minutes) rather than Rush's more radio-friendly vocal numbers with the rare huge sidelong work, even back this far. This group is more metal-oriented than early-generation prog tends to be, so if you believe Black Sabbath can coexist with Genesis, this is your band."
2,A collector's item only,"I love Dream Theater, but this one is simply a collector's piece to let you know how the great band got its start. If you want to check out Dream Theater, try another CD. I seldom listen to it."
1,BE CAREFUL WHO YOU ORDER FROM,I CAN'T BELIEVE AMAZON IS ASKING ME FOR THE 2ND TIME TO REVIEW THIS ITEM I ORDERED FROM THEM THROUGH AN OUTSIDE VENDOR THAT I NEVER RECEIVED. ALL I CAN SAY IS THAT IF YOU'RE GOING ORDER MAKE SURE YOU GET IT FROM AMAZON AND NOT SOME OTHER COMPANY WHO WILL JUST TAKE YOUR MONEY.
2,The Prog- Metal Dilemma,"Altough this isn't horrible, I can't totally warm up to bands like Dream Theater. If you wanna be prog, go for it all the way and forget the Metallica crowd. For their info; Prog guitar IS Robert Fripp, Steve Hackett, Steve Howe not Van Halen and Yngwie Malmsteen(poofy haired macho metal posing). Occasional brilliance,especially(maybe only) the drumming, but in the end too 80's dated (the only decade where the sound doesn't translate to today)and too metal. I'd rather listen to Rush over these guys."
3,Good CD but the worst of the Theater,"This is a very good Cd but if we compare this one with the nexts DT albums could be the worst one, maybe is just that in my opinion James has give to the band on each song more thanC. Dominici gave in the entire disc. But any way was a good start."
3,"Good Musicianship, But Not Very Engaging","I bought Dream Theater's second album before I purchased this one. While their second release is very good, I find this one not to be up to the subsequent album's standards. Most of the songs are not too engaging and probably would have been better off as instrumentals than vocal songs. The vocals and instrumentation just don't seem to mesh well. The singer's not bad; reminds me of Geddy Lee sort of. The songs that are the best representations are ""Ytse Jam,"" and ""Afterlife."" For a debut, this album is not bad, but the production could've been better. One of the songs remind me of Fates Warning. All in all this is a pretty good album, just sounds kind of disjointed."
3,"interesting vocals, but a good album","Yes, Dominici may sound like a stoned C-3PO, but the thing to focus in on, as with all DT, is Petrucci and Portnoy. Altough his crowning moment is on once in a livetime's fantastic 8ish minute solo, you can hear his majestic work loud and clear. And about the lyrics: Dominici sounded slightly like Kc's Robert Fripp, so if you think about him, the vocals are ok."
4,Rare find for those DT fans,Happy to get this DT rare CD. Nice to experience the early days of DT without James Labrie. Not as great as their later albums but good nonetheless.
3,Aligning success,"Expectedly ambitious debut is sprinkled with technical intrigue mainly in the form of blistering guitar solo work, setting the stage for a long and fruitful career if not creating a downright irresistible first release."
3,shows potential,"There are two types of DT fans: those who listen to DT as heavy metal, and those who listen to them as adventurous, progressive music. I am the latter, so I was dissapointed that this album, while showing immense potential, is ultimately an above-average 80's metal CD. Charlie Dominici, the original vocalist, is not as bad as everyone says, and reminds me somewhat of Labrie, but with nowhere near the range + power. Kevin Moore on keys is a nice touch, though, and I prefer him to Derek Sherinian. (DT's new key man, Jordan Rudess, is sure to trash 'em both, however!) There are a few glimpses into odd meters (one song is in 9/4) and, of course, the classic Ytse Jam (DT's original name, Majesty, spelled backwards) is worth the entire price of the CD. If you've never heard DT, however, this is not the CD for you (unless you're a fan of 80's shred metal). Images + Words, or Awake would be a better jumping off point."
4,Very good beginning,"This CD displays the growing talents of the main members of Dream Theater. Though the vocals are not as soaring and powerful as they are with James Labre, this is a great beginning to THE best progressive bands around. Myung's bass has come a long way from this album. He seems to be a bit muted at times. The album has a touch of the 80's metal to it, but what sets it apart from the ""hair bands"" of the 80's is the intricate layering of notes and tempo shifts. If your a DT fan, you must check them out on this CD. Not their best CD, but it showcases a band with tremendous talent and hlighlights why they are a force to be considered in the Prog rock arena."
5,A substantial work on Nostradamus,"Lemesurier's book is a significant effort to reveal the written sources underlying the prophecies of Nostradamus. He especially manages to show convincingly how Nostradamus drew on contemporary publications for implicit references in his abundant use of omens. In this way Lemesurier reveals where Nostradamus really took his ""inspiration"" for many of his prophetic verses. This book represents one more substantial step in the critical evaluation of the work of the famous Renaissance prophet."
2,Not a genuine reprinting,"What I wanted was a modern reprint of the original. What I got is a book that has only the quatrains, but NONE of the images. The page numbers are also all off because of the omissions. I would also like to have the original verse along side the translation.This book is anything but complete. And is a waste if you want all of the clues intact. It's no wonder people can't understand it."
3,Good materials ... Just a little indescriptive.,"Perhaps if I were to read this prior to reading Erika Cheetham's book on Nostradamus: The Final Prophecies, I would have given this a 5-star review. However, this book lacks the translation fluidly given and found in Erika's book on the same subject. I had to put this book down as I was looking for more analysis of the gifted foreseer. Of course without God Nostradamus would never have the gift to foresee the troubles ahead and currently manifesting right before our eyes."
1,need a degree to understand,"I didn't understand a word in this book, either did my son. I sent back. I wanted a book that translates what he predicted to what we can understand."
2,NO ES MUY BUENO.,"EEL MATARIAL ES MUY INCOMODO PARA UNA BEBE, Y LA PELUCA NO SE AMOLDA BIEN ASI QUE UNA BEBE ACTIVA LA TIRA CONTANTEMENTE."
3,Princess Leia-Infant,I got this just in the nick of time.. but it was adorable on the grand baby. We didn't use the funky wig as she had her own hair that her mom put in cute little buns on each side of her head. LOVED IT!
2,made very cheaply,"Costume is made very cheaply, and the head piece tore as i took it out of the package. I wouldnt recommend this particular brand of costume if you plan on using this for more than one event."
2,"Cute, but falls apart","As soon as we took it out of the package, one of the ""hair buns"" fell right off. It also looks like the other one will soon. So we're already sewing it to fix it. We'll also have to make some kind of chin strap for it, because like one of the previous posters said, it's way too big for a newborn. When we ordered it, we we're on the fence on which size to get. We decided on the smaller one. It turns out the smaller one is even way too big. I can't imagine the land of giant babies where these must have been made. So, yeah, its cute, but it looks like they spent $1.50 on the materials and had a 2 year old sew it."
2,Too Big For My Newborn!,"I bought the smallest size for my little girl's first Halloween. She was born in May and has been in the 75th percentile all the way. So I was very surprised when I received this costume and it was HUGE on her. I even double checked the packaging, sure they had sent me the Infant (6-12 month) in error. Nope. Although she was 5 months old, the costume went a good twelve inches past her feet. So, we ended up getting a different costume for her for this year and hope she'll be able to wear it next year."
5,The BIg Sky,"This is a really great movie. Kirk Douglas was great, Arthur Hunnicutt as well, and Elizabeth Threatt was breathtaking in her role as Teal Eye. I was surprised to learn that this was the only movie that Elizabeth was ever in. I recommend this film to any who like the old westerns. This film is full of action from start to finish. I also appreciate the fact that the seller sent it promptly. My hat goes off to the seller. Thank you."
1,Bait and Switch,Don't purchase this if you're expecting to get a 1500 mAh Power2000 ACD-674 battery. They sent a 1300 mAh Digicom battery instead.
2,Misleading rubbish.,"With the exception of Voyage of the Acolyte and Darktown Steve Hackett's solo career has been a spotty mess. This disc is no different. Do not be misled by the packaging that heralds the presence of Marillion's Mosely and Trewavas. They play on one song. The songs are weak, the production dated and the drums sound as if they were miked to the inside of a dustbin. Hackett's got talent but seldom is able to pull it off as a frontman. Weak songs, poor supporting musicians usually sink his recordings and did so here...Simon"
4,A Great Classic (But With a Caveat),"While I concur wholeheartedly with the superlatives applied to this film by the other reviewers, I feel that I must point out that this release appears to have been mastered from a release print rather than one from the vaults. The film has not been restored. There are long, deep scratches running throughout the film that could have been remedied by careful restoration. Warners is usually much better about this. Please don't let this deter you from purchasing this film. It is truly a classic, but could have been better handled."
3,Good for it's time,"This film, while entertaining, is perhaps not the most well acted or presented film. The cinematography and score, however, can't be easily beat! It's a shame that a film with such amazing elements as the latter must be saddled with a simplistic and under represented plot. It is definitely very well done in the context of it's time!"
3,Judas Goat,"""The Informer"" is about how hard times will make a man turn in another to certain death, if there's enough money involved. Victor McLaglen turns in Wallace Ford to the Black and Tans, and spends the rest of the movie trying to come to terms with his actions. The movie was a bit too antique for my tastes, and seemed overly long as well. But it does show the occupation of Ireland by the British and the terrible effects it had on the native population."
5,the informer,"It's one of the best move to show the viewer an insight in the life so hard, but made more so by the english hold in Irland & it people, But on reading a number of review that set the move in 1922, I would not say that by 1922 the Irish war had come to a end on January 7. And on January 18, 1922, two days after the new Provisional Government took office, Michael Collins took possession of Dublin Castle, so bring a end to British rule in Ireland, One must write the true, so as not to give out the wrong info, as is give out by so many source today."
5,The Omen hooked me instantly as a great horror film.,"The Omen is one of the few good horror films out on the market. From the opening in Rome to the end in Washington, The Omen is worth viewing. It doesn't smudge the real biblical prophecies and adds a nice twist to the anti-christ revelation. Believe me, The Omen is good stuff!"
3,"Good, but a few flaws","I thought that this was a very entertaining movie for the most part and the acting by Gregory Peck and David Warner was very good. However, I thought that Lee Remick's performance was less than inspiring. I thought that this movie got off to a rough, slow start despite jumping right into the main plot. However, 20 minutes later I was enthralled in the plot. This was sustained until the end, which I found rather dissapointing despite a decent twist. You can basically tell that Omen II (which I have not yet scene) was on the minds of producers while they finished the original-- I never like that combination. Overall, though, a very adequate film and a great choice for fans of the genre."
3,666,The omen in many respects is a good movie but concentrates to much on Damien's father Robert Thorn trying to find out Damiens true identity and does not focuss enough on Damiens behavior etc.I like how in this film a lot of it is based on the bible.Some moments in this are good and stand out especially when the thorns visit the church and Damien goes mad lashing out at his mother and screaming.The Omen 2 is much better.
3,The movie of The Omen,"I think that the movie showed Gregory Peck trying to kill Damien at the end, but a cop thought Peck went nuts trying to kill a kid, so the cop shot him. I didn't know that in the book, Peck gets killed by a falling object. END"
4,THE OMEN IS A GOOD FILM BUT IT COULD DEFINATELY BE IMPROVED,"WHEN I FIRST SAW THE OMEN I THOUGHT THAT IT WAS GOING TO BE A REALLY GREAT FILM BUT IT WASN'T.IT DIDN'T HAVE SOME OF THE BITS I HEARD ABOUT: 1)DAMIEN WAS GOING TO ATTACK THE PRIEST THAT WAS BAPTISING HIM. 2)THE PRIEST THAT WAS TRYING TO WARN GREGORY PECK GOT KILLED WHEN A WOMAN OPENED HER WINDOW AND SOMETHING FELL ON HIM,INSTEAD HE GETS KILLED WHEN HE GOES TO THE CHURCH AND SOMETHING FALLS ON HIM AND SLICES HIM IN HALF! THE OMEN IS A GOOD FILM BUT IT COULD DEFENINATELY BE IMPROVED, LIKE AT THE MINUTE DAMIEN WAS BORN HE WOULD KNOW THAT HE WAS THE SON OF SATAN AND WHAT HIS MISSION WAS AND KILLING ANYONE THAT WAS IN HIS WAY.WOULD IT BE POSSIBLE TO REMASTER THE WHOLE FILM? END"
5,A Classic,"""The Omen"" is one of those few, infact very few realistic horror films. A story that is based on a real fact. Excellent chemistry between Greggory Peck and Lee Remick, the romantic score by Jerry Goldsmith is simply delightfull. Billie Whitelaw was fabulous as the evil Governess, she was very expressive and done her part really well. David Warner as usual gives his best performence. Last but not the least the child Harvey Stephens does very well, the evil expressions that easily potrayed from the little child. Haunting music from Jerry Goldsmith. Excellent scenarios and wonderfull direction makes the film a true classic. If you love classics, trust me you will definately love this one too."
1,"One star for this ""2 disc"" release only (5 stars for the movie)","Firstly, again, the rating is for this re-release only. Considering this release does NOT appear to be remastered I don't see the point of releasing this movie again over the previous incarnation. Nearly all the bonuses are already included in the previous release. All they seem to have done is split it on two discs which is supposed to make it ""special"". Granted there appears to be another commentary track, some still photos and a minor deleted scene ( by Mrs. Baylock attack) -- but that is not enough for those of us who already own it on the previous DVD release. If you don't all ready have it the by all means get it. Clearly a convenient cash grab on to celebrate June 6, 2006."
3,Watchable...,"...But its no Exorcist. Gets three stars from me for decent cinematography, Gregory Peck's performance and the scene with the mad baboons in the zoo attacking Damien and Lee Remick. The score by Jerry Goldsmith whose music I usually love is just awful. The direction is so so. Richard Donner still has not been able to top his work in Superman and the first two Lethal Weapon movies."
3,"Good Thriller, yet not disturbing","After seeing The Exorcist, I knew I would try this movie. Gregory Peck and Lee Remick are excellent as the parents of Damien. The child who plays him is equally creepy. Some people say this is as disturbing as The Exorcist, I don't think that. Although this was entertaining, it was not as disturbing as The Exorcist. The concept of Satan's son roming the earth and the unknowing parents who adopt him is the only disturbing part.Good to watch, but not as thrilling as some think it is."
5,CLASSIC,"THIS MOVIE IS ONE OF THE BEST HORROR MOVIES EVER MADE. WHO WOULD BELIVE A LITTLE BOY WHO IS SO CUTE BE SO EVIL. IT HAS ALL THE QUALITIES OF A CLASSIC. GREGORY PECK AND LEE REMICK ARE GREAT. YOU REALLY FEEL SORRY FOR THEM IN THIS MOVIE. THEY HAVE A BEAUTIFUL BABY BOY THAT TURNS OUT TO BE SO EVIL. AND THE DOG, TO THIS DAY I STAY AWAY FROM DOGS THAT LOOK LIKE IT. THE NANNY IS ALSO GOOD-SHE IS THE TYPE THAT YOU LOVE TO HATE. THIS MOVIE IS ALMOST AS SCARY AS THE EXORCIST. THERE ARE SOME GORY SCENCES, BUT IT IS BLENDED INTO THE MOVIE SO WELL THAT WITHOUT THEM THEY WOULD BE MISSED. I WOULD DEFINETLY RECCOMMEND THIS ONE."
5,666,"The Omen is another one of those classic movies. This was the first birth of the antichrist an original movie not based on others like Friday the 13th or Nightmare on Elm Street did to Texas Chainsaw. The kid that played damien was terrific he made the kid seem really scary. The plot was terrific and the background music made the scary seens even more frieghtning. This movie has it all scares, blood and gore, and of course a twisting plot. This makes just more afarid of 666 then normal. This rivals the Exorcist as the best horror movie ever."
1,Miscommunication somewhere,"I'm pretty sure I ordered the Gregory Peck version of The Omen, but got the 2006 remake. Obviously, a sub-par version and I am very disappointed in not receiving what I ordered."
5,Beware of what you think is a gift from heaven.,"The movie has all the genre of a mystery written by Stephen King, et al. The performances are outstanding. As an aside, does any one have more beautiful eyes than the leading lady? The ""nanny"" was outstanding. Mr. Peck is looking aged in this flick."
2,Severely Overrated,"Satan's son has arrived and he's not about to let his human parents get in his way. Christian horror movies tend to have overly simplistic, boring, juvenile theological foundations, and this is no exception. The hysterical priest is unintentionally comical in his over-the-top, Bellevue-esque rampages (I laughed out loud when he claimed that some dude named Bugenhagen was the only one on planet Earth who had a solution). The scoring is also surprisingly terrible. It's simply too overused, generic, abrupt, and intrusive to be enjoyable. It seemed like every single minute of running time ends with some kind of lame soundtrack getting blared in my ears in an amateurish attempt to force emotions onto me. There are a few cool death scenes, but they used too many ""animal going psycho"" scenarios which felt kinda lazy. Atmosphere is minimized, there's no sense of dread at any point, and the ending is unsatisfying. This is an overrated ""classic"" in my eyes."
2,Disappointment,I was disappointed with the content of this film. Next time that I buy a movie I will make sure that it is good and not the ametuer film making displayed in this picture.
1,weird movie,"How should i put this,um this movie was very pathetic kind of.The movie i'll admit had a good plot.But one thing is to have good efects in a movie.Now i know some people dont care about if a movie does or doesn't have any good effects but lets be a little realistic.I'm not going to say anything about who dies but if someone see's this movie like i did for the first time tonight with my friends i want someone to notice how each person dies its lame.I mean not lame how they die but notice when they die you can tell its fake.Oh well i dont care about renting the sequels to this movie."
5,SCARIER THAN ROSEMARY'S BABY!!!,"This is definately one of the scariest movies ever made, but in oreder for it to scare you, you do have to take it seriously!... I love this movie and I am in the process of buying it... Buy or Rent today!"
3,Bad Seed.,"The whole plot of THE OMEN revolves around the idea of the anti-Christ growing up and living amongst us, unknown to anyone until it's too late. The premise of the film is somewhat interesting, and was a farely new concept when the movie was released, but has become common place nowadays. The ""scariness"" of THE OMEN isn't in blood and guts, but in the shock value: we barely see a nanny hang herself outdoors from a window, but it is shocking; we've been told that Damien's mother was a jackal so when his adopted father searches the grave, we shouldn't be shocked, but we are; the newspaper photographer already showed us how he would die, but when it happens it is a bit shocking. The film really is dated now, but it contains a couple of gems, mainly the soundtrack and Gregory Peck. The movie probably isn't as spooky as it was originally, but it's still an interesting film to watch."
4,Political horror-thriller at its best,"The Omen is a movie you have to see if you want to understand the distrust that swept through America with Watergate, and never really died away. The name ""Damien"" has become synonymous with ""evil,"" proof that this movie has survived for 30 years with the same power it had in the 1970s, when it took 8 award nominations and won an Oscar. One of the most explicit skewerings of political ambition ever created, Damien stands for everything that is rotten and unfair in government. A cautionary tale that has as much to say today as it did then."
4,The Omen,"This was a great movie. I saw it a few times on American Movie Classics and then bought it on DVD. Gregory Peck gives an excellent performance as the adoptive father of the Anticrist. The little boy who played Damien also did an excdllent job. I was surprised that he didn't go on to act in other films.This is also a great DVD. It offers all sorts of special features and the theatrical trailer. It also has a great soundtrack. If you haven't seen it yet, it's defenately worth a rent."
4,You have been warned !,"Not many horror movies have stood the test of time for being able to terrify viewers from generation to generation.THE OMEN is one such example.The release of the 2-disc C.E. which is to celebrate its 30th anniversary includes a bulk of special features on the second disc.Aside from David Seltzer's interesting script and Richard Donner's masterful direction,what distinctly differentiates this movie from other horror movies is Jerry Goldsmith's Oscar-winning original score (Best Music 1976),which gives it a disturbingly eerie atmosphere of horror.Listening to it makes you feel as though you were listening to a medieval chant performed by a cult of devil worshippers.Extremely haunting.If you are squeamish,do not watch it alone !"
4,Good Movie,"Good movie, not all blood and guts. Like it much better than the remake that they did a while back."
4,Great Horror....No Gore Needed.....,"I don't have to go into all the details of this movie to say that this is a great film. Truly scary and suspenseful! Excellent cast.... especially the little ""demon"" who played a child possessed. Love the music in this movie which makes it even scarier. The Omen will always be a classic. Even though sequels have followed, this original will always be the best."
5,Makes THE EXORCIST look like MARY POPPINS,"This is a horror classic! A baby is born in Rome of a jackal, and adopted by the Thorns in England. When he begins to cause havoc - his nanny hangs herself and a priest is impaled after warning he is the son of the Devil, Robert Thorn, his stepfather, investigates and discovers a horrifying truth . . . This movie, even though it is old, is still sinister and menacing! I hope there is a DVD transfer in the works too. The main difference between this one, and its inspiration, THE EXORCIST, is that THE OMEN goes for mayhem and hysteria where EXORCIST goes for shock value(the crucifix scene). Gregory Peck and Lee Remick were brilliant in this one, and the hanging scene will remain imprinted on your mind for a long time. Oh, and David Warner also appears and gets decapitated! Excellent musical score by Jerry Goldsmith as well. Don't miss it."
5,ONE OF THE FEW THAT CAN HANG WITH 'THE EXORCIST',"The writing in this chiller was occasionally a bit too ostentatious, but the acting of Peck, Remick, and Warner was superb, Donner's direction was subtle, the cinematography was suitably creepy, and Jerry Goldsmith's unforgettable score was almost a seperate entity in one of the great classics of the horror genre. As with earlier masterpieces of the macabre ( THE HAUNTING, THE INNOCENTS, THE CHANGELING, THE LEGEND OF HELL HOUSE... ) buckets of blood ( with the notable exception of one particularly indelible scene ) weren't needed to create a truly sinister, and unrelenting sense of mounting terror. Kids can be so cute..."
1,ANOTHER WATHCES A DUMB MOVIE,Ok if you think this movie was a good horror movie then i dont want to know what you do in your spare time because this movie was dumb.I didn't even jump in the movie.The special effects if you even call them special effects were pathetic.I dont care if it was made in 1976 it still was stupid.Star Wars and Jaws were made at the same time and had good special effects.If you have about 2 hours to waste then watch this movie if you dont then dont watch this.
2,"poorly written,inaccurate",don't bother to buy this very poorly written book that has distorted facts.The author is basically repeating various quotes from many sources repeatedly.Boring...His facts are wrong.For example he states that Graham Nash was a very compromising person.In fact he was not and this has been verified with his past history with the Hollies.I am not a critical person but this book was a real disappointment to me...
2,Too Much of Nothing,"This book is filled with information on the LA singer song writer music scene focusing on the late sixties to the eighties. For me the scope was too broad with too many artists featured. The timelines get layered and out of synch. And there is way too much information on the music moguls to be of much interest to anybody but music business insiders. Complex relationships are reduced to the simplist: who slept with who, egos clashing, who was doing what drugs...My biggest complaint was the redundancy: the point that money, drugs and fame corrupts gets beaten to death.. There is really not enough focus on the music..saying all that, the book was chock full information and did a decent effort to capture the LA singer song writer scene of that time. That the author felt the music was that important to write this much detail is well... indulgent..Only a hand full of the artists he tracks thru time are worth the mention today..."
2,"jumbled assortment of info, some fascinating","If you're a fan of CSNY, Joni Mitchell, Jackson Browne, Eagles you may find this an interesting read. It does not read as a narrative given from an inside view. It appears to be a montage of info collected from various interviews with the players involved and those around them. The best part is the Laurel Canyon beginnings of the singer-songwriter movement in L.A.It stops rather abruptly in the early 80s, although he occassionally makes mention of happenings in the 90s and 2000s. I got the book from the library and enjoyed it. If I had paid for it, I probably would have been disappointed."
2,Hotel California,Nothing new or exciting in this book. The author tries to cover too much ground. It would have been better if he had concentrated on fewer people.
1,Hated It! Very Disappointing,"I bought this book because I love the music that came out of California's Laurel Canyon from 1965 to 1975ish. I am also a musician and was looking forward to reading about how these artists influenced each other's music. Instead, the book was filled with ALOT about managers and record companies. It was way more focused on the business side of this time period. I also don't like the way the author portrays the artists and gives his slanted opinion of some of their music - which, by the way, I totally disagree with. I am hugely disappointed and sorry that I spent the money and time to read it. YUK!"
4,A Thoroughly Enjoyable Summer Read,"This is the definitive story of Laurel Canyon and the rise and fall of the singer-songwriters that defined an era. Fabulous backstage gossip, great interviews, and a long, revealing look at David Geffen and his role in shaping the sound and artistry of so many great musicians -- Joni, Laura, CSNY, Gene Clark, JT, you name it.I enjoyed this book so much I didn't want it to end. It also turned me on to some forgotten songwriters and albums that got lost in the shuffle -- Judee Sill being one amazing example.An essential read for music fans."
2,Disappointing ....,"""Jack of all trades, master of none."" This cliche applies to this work. In trying to cover so many musicians over so much time, the author ends up skipping over a lot of what we readers would like to know about them."
1,Poor work on this book,"One star for some of the photos, nice to see some new ones from that time period, even if they're only in dull black and white. BUT, what a let-down this book otherwise is! He has one of the most fascinating topics to write about but he manages, chapter after tedious chapter, to dull the information with his writing style, trying to cover way too much territory, and I'm just glad that I found this at the local library and didn't waste any money on it.I feel that he went out of his way to take a whack at the entire 1970's southern Cali music scene, the likes of which we'll never know of again. Such a waste of energy this book is because of that."
3,"Hotel California: The True-Life Adventures of Crosby, Stills, Nash, Young, Mitchell, Taylor, Browne, Ronstadt, Geffen, the Eagle","No Pretender. Interesting insight into the genre of singer-songwriter and into the time period when music was becoming personal to a generation that would lay the groundwork music for future generations. Good background story on the artists and players, explaining with some detail the lyrics that still roll around in my head. Somewhat shallow story describing a shallow lifestyle that resulted in deep emotion. Too much repetition, would have been more interesting if more of the story was told with less dialogue. That said - it's worth the time, and the knowledge gain. Good to know who's behind Linda's ""You're no good"", and Joni's ""Case of You"" and why James went to ""Mexico"". Boomer fodder."
2,wasn't my favorite,"Having just read the John Hammond bio that I purchased at the same time, I was not as impressed with this book. Even though I am familiar with many of the artists, it just didn't hold my interest that well. The author did seem to know his material, though. I just saw Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young again this summer. I wonder how they feel about each other now with so much gone on in decades before! It's a wonder more of these people didn't die of drug overdoses or std's! If you want an uplifting experience, this isn't for you!"
4,California Dreaming,"I received this soon after ordering it. It was in perfect condition. It is very informative on the late 60's/70's California country-rock scene. It bounces back and forth a lot, sometimes leaving one unsure exactly when certain things happened, with a lot of names to follow and such, but it is still very interesting and informative. It's great to have as a reference for someone as into the scene as I am. It contains some really outta sight pics as well!"
2,hotel california,"poorly written and altogether trashy. if all your interested in is knowing who Joni Mitchell slept with, there are cheaper and faster ways of finding this out. author has the annoying habit of stringing along multiple adjectives to describe the qualities of his subject--it's like he has a checklist of modifiers and intensifiers and has to make his way thru the entire list. save your money!!by the way, laurel canyon (the book) covers much the same cultutral territory and historical period in a much more satisfying way."
5,A Real Page Turner for Fans of the California 70's Rock,I couldn't put this book down. It brought back memories of days at the Troubador and all the great music that was created by this group of musicians dwelling in Laurel Canyon.
2,"kind of boring , skips around too much, flow not good to the book. was nice to think about more free flowing days instead of how","kind of boring , skips around too much, flow not good to the book. was nice to think about more free flowing days instead of howmusic business is today"
2,Not as good as I thought,"While I enjoyed reading the history of some of my favorite musicians and bands, it wasn't quite the page turner I expected. Plus I found it difficult to read. Almost like Mr. Hoskyns set out to find rarely used descriptive words to make the story sound more interesting. Dennis Wilson was ""handsome and priapic""? ""Keith imbibed the sacred laws of country soul."" Not the book I thought it would be."
3,I love it.,"So far, it's performing very well. I'm making sure to follow the care instructions and hope to get many years of use out of it."
1,I am about to throw it away,After 2 and a half years of work (may be once a week only) I need to throw it away. Deeply disappointed.
2,wow! no wonder it's calphalon!!,"(Purchased in may 2003) I just have to say how excited I was when I bought this skillet because it was ""calphalon"" wooooo!!! Oh well after 2 months of using rubber spatulas, it's peeling!!! where is it now?, somewhere in a junkyard. I don't want to develop cancer from Calphalon you know. Too many law suits nowadays, anyway.... Those of you who enjoy it, more power to you. Me I'm a cast iron gal.Back to nature..."
5,NEVER KNEW COOKING COULD BE LIKE THIS...,"I just got this griddle, and I was surprised by how evenly it cooks. Omlets come out light and fluffy, perfectly heated throughout. Not a a speck of egg stuck either, making for easy cleanup. Great little pan for a great price!"
5,High end pan. Best pan I have ever bought. A+.,This is a great pan for frying eggs. Also good for pancakes. Pan is built to superior quality. I am convinced that this is the highest quality pan I have ever bought. Calphalon products are high end. This is not stuff you buy at your local department store.
2,Too shallow and hard to clean,this pan is too shallow to use for anything but eggs. It is too steep sided to really make and toss a crepe. It is of nice quality and the nonstick surface appears nice however this pan lacks multi functional use. I have no clue where all these glowing reviews come from.
5,"Liked it so much, ordered two more","My wife likes this pan so much, we ordered two more for Christmas gifts for our daughters... It is a nice size, heats evenly, and NO Stick!!"
5,Best little frying pan EVER,I originally bought this pan for my mother. I recently stayed with her and had the opportunity to try the pan out. What a joy! A non-stick pan that is truly non-stick; heavy for the size; nice even heating. It's a great pan!
5,Hard to beat,"I have 15 pieces of Calphalon purchased over the last 5 years, mostly in the commercial hard anodized line. I've been happy with all of them, but if I could only have 3, I would keep the 12"" everyday, the 2 1/2 qt shallow saucepan and the 10"" commercial nonstick crepe pan.The 12"" everyday is my favorite and the most versatile, but for perfect omlettes, crepes, tortillas or grilled sandwiches, nothing is going to beat this little gem. I've used it quite a bit over a couple of years and haven't noticed any deterioration in the coating, although I only use nylon utensils and no abrasive cleaners.This is a must have pan."
1,Non-Stick Surface Does Not Last,"I chose this pan for the calphalon name (and it was on sale). It was great for the first 2-3 months,...then unfortunately the non-stick surface self destructed, and the pan had to be tossed. This is despite taking very good care to always use plastic cooking utensils, teflon safe sponges etc. I was very dissapointed and expected way more from calphalon."
5,Best All Around pan there is,"This pan rocks! Last christmas I received a set of Calphlon Hard-Anodized pots & pans. I used the pan for eggs one time and that was it, never again. While shopping for other gifts I saw this pan at a large fashion retailer based out of MN. It was on sale and had the non-stick coating. So I bought it, because I knew the other pans wouldn't work for a lot of my cooking. I absolutely love this pan. I can warm the pan with out any oil, butter, or non-stick spray, drop an egg on it and it doesn't stick. I have yet to find anything that sticks to this surface. As far as durability, I have used it for a almost a year now, it does have a couple knicks (due to my wife using metal utensils), but for the most part it is flawless. All in all, the best non-stick pan for that price."
5,Calphalon Commercial Nonstick 10-Inch Pan,"Really nice product. Size is good, heats and cooks evenly, non-stick works well and is durable."
5,All around fantastic!,Just a great little gem - From crepes to omelets - It's a real handy little work horse indeed. You will not be dissapointed and the price is right!
3,NICE PAN...,"The pan was nice - feels heavier and more substantial than less expensive cookware. Only con, the handel is too narrow - not as easy to pick up and handel as it should be."
4,Was Great At First,"I have had two of these for a year now and after using about 3 times a week,I can tell a difference in performance.Mostly used to cook breakfast,you know the healthy stuff,bacon,eggs and hashbrowns.Foods are starting to stick a little.If they stay like this,it'll be O.K.I can only envision what happens to teflon pans,because that's all I've had in the past..getting worse,but these are not teflon.Hope they hold out."
4,LOVE THIS PAN,"THIS IS NOT A CHEAP CRAPPY PAN.IF YOU KNOW NOTHING ABOUT PANS READ THE REVIEWS AND TAKE THERE ADVISE, I DID.I LOVE MAKING SCRAMBLED EGGS THAT LOOK LIKE THE KIND YOU GET IN RESTAURANTS(YOU KNOW THE ONE )BUT MY OLD PANS KEPT BURNING THEM :( UNTIL I GOT THESE...BINGO.I GAVE IT 4 STARS BECAUSE THE HANDLES ARE TO THIN AND IF YOURE NOT CAREFUL YOU'LL TIP YOUR FOOD OVER.THATS ALL THERE IS TO IT, GET IT BEFORE THE BRING IT BACK TO THE ORIGINAL RETAIL PRICE."
5,Oooh I love it!,Best pan I've ever bought! Works beautifully for crepes omelettes etc with little or no fat
5,"Sits flat on burner, stays in place, cooks evenly at low heat","I like it a lot. It has weight to it and sits flat on the burner. Cooks evenly and quickly using a lot less heat - about half of what other pans use. Handle doesn't get that hot at all. Didn't need any butter, food did not stick to the surface. Very easy to clean."
4,"Calphalon 10"" round griddle",I am been using this product for last five years. I am very satisfied with the product. Since I have fiberglass cooking range only on this griddle I can make fresh totias(Indian Roti). Because it gets very hot the cover starts peeling after about six months that's the only problem.
5,What's not to love?,"Honestly, I would marry this pan if it would clean up after itself. Oh wait, it practically does... The invitations are in the mail!This pan makes picture perfect pancakes, it heats up in a flash, and it cleans like a dream. A great investment."
5,Calphalon Crepe Pan,"Wow, I love using this pan and will be adding to my Calphalon collection for years to come. Non-stick surface is terrific and a no fail product."
5,Fantastic,"I own a number of these pans. Crepes, here we go. Also useful for as a general purpose pan - I like it being shallow. Very good non-stick surface, seems in a great shape after 1/2 year of use.Update July 2012: The pans are still going strong. I still love them."
5,Great pan!!!,This is a wonderful quality pan. Making crepes for the very first time was very easy with this wonderful pan!
1,Worst product from the Brand,I thought this gonna last long. After 6 months of normal use it lost the nonstick coating. I always use wooden or nylon spoons. Very bad quality from Calphalon.DON'T BUY.
3,Beware- No dishwasher,I have loved this pan with the exception of the loss of the non-stick coating which is now occurring after 2 years of almost daily. I believe that putting it in the dishwasher was the cause of this problem. It is no longer non-stick and in fact encourages sticking. I depended on the review of another customer who advised she had always put one in the dishwasher without negative consequences. I should have heeded the manufacturers warning. Do not use Dishwasher.
3,Great until the coating deteriorated,This was everyone's favorite pan until something happened to the surface. Now food sticks and is hard to clean. We gave up on it. Too bad -- this was an excellent pan while it lasted.
1,A tale of two returns,"I never got my pans to the kitchen stove. My first pan had two significant pits in the nonstick surface, so I returned it and received a replacement pan that had one, even larger, pit in the nonstick surface, as well. My one star is for Amazon and their excellent customer service. I'm very disappointed that my experience seems to be so different from the majority of reviews."
4,Dandy pan for making omlettes,It's a good depth for cooking big omlettes. The metal handle means you can finish it off in the oven. The only reason it didn't have five stars is because I'd have liked it to have a lid (so I can use it for sauces as well).
2,Non-stick surface comes off,"I have had this pan for about three years and don't use it that often. The non-stick surface does not stand up to wear. Within a few uses, the coating started to come up. I made some pancakes on it this morning and have decided that it's time to retire the pan to the trash. I will be buying the Le Creuset cast iron pan. It's more cost effective to buy the more expensive pan if you don't have to throw it away!"
3,Egg Beaters stick....,"After reading all the great reviews I was looking forward to trying out this pan. I let it heat up a little extra long as suggested by others, poured in some Egg Beaters, and.....they stuck. They stuck a little worse than with my regular old pan. My husband used it for a grilled cheese and it seared the bread before getting close to melting the cheese....so use at a lower then normal temperature but let it heat up longer?It's still a nice pan....just doesn't live up to the hype so far."
5,Best Buy to date....,"I have tried quite a few non-stick griddles and I use them for a variety of things that i cook - pancakes, omlettes, crepes, etc. I have tried Teflon, Faberwear, Mirror, etcThis is the best one that i have used and I was so thrilled with my purchase. What i like best about it is that i use little or no oil and my crepes are the best tasting in the world.i would strongly suggest buying this griddle if you are looking for quality and value for money!!!"
5,"definate thumbs up, I love these pans and can't quit buying them.",we love these pans the cleanup is simple and the heat is distributed evenly over the entire surface.
3,Calphalon broke my heart,"I paid $28 for this pan with free shipping. I think that is a fair market value. It was not a deal at all.My first thought when I picked up the box: Oh no, they sent the wrong thing. This is not nearly heavy enough to be Calphalon.My first thought when I held the pan in my hands: Gee, maybe it will be nice to not always use really heavy pans.Yeah. Then I turned on the light in my kitchen.Calphalon, you done us wrong.It's a nice enough pan. It is not Calphalon quality by any stretch.It came with small scratches on the bottom of the pan and the handle. Not enough to send it back.The workmanship is sadly lacking. The handle is small and not heat-resistant as it should be.The rivets are secure and seem sturdy, but are very poorly machined and ugly, showing cut marks and uneven surfaces.The underside of the inadequate handle is not finished.So please, Calphalon, call this stuff Calphalon II, or EveryDay, but don't lead us to think it is the quality we enjoy from Toledo, Ohio."
4,Grilled Cheese/Eggs Anyone?,"I have enjoyed this pan. It cooks so quickly and easily. It makes perfect eggs anyway you like them and browns grilled cheese to perfection even when using spreadable margarines. One reviewer said that you could not cook on high heat. Well, you don't want to. Because this pan heats up quickly, a lower heat is best. I put it on my electric range on number 3 (2 numbers from the lowest setting), let it heat up for a few minutes, and pour my scrambled eggs in. They come out PERFECT! Cooking on high heat with these types of pans will ruin the suface on the inside in a very short period of time as well as heating it with nothing in it for a period of time. I give this four because I'm still not sure how long the inside surface will last. For now, I am enjoying the even heating and the superslick non stick interior. For the price, it's wonderful!"
4,Awesome!,Great pan-no problems. The only draw back is it's a lot heavier than my wife's previous crepe pan and it took her a while to get used to it's heft.
3,Good omlet pan,"This is a good pan. It's heavy, heats fairly evenly over a gas burner and the non-stick works well without any oil or grease. Good omlet and crepe pan, grill cheese etc. Too small for pancakes or a full skillet of meat or vegtables."
3,Calphalon NonStick?,"This is a great pan, when it is new. However, after a couple of years the teflon will start to flake, and everything will stick, at this point it is useless. Might I suggest theScanpan Classic Ceramic Titanium 10-Inch Crepe Pan, it is more expensive but it will last much longer, and you will not need to handle it with kid gloves."
3,Nice Design. Non Stick surface peeling.,"It have had this pan for about 8 months. It was great for several months of daily use. I hand wash with and never use metal utensils. But after about 6 months of near daily use (I have an omelet or a cooked egg every morning) that the center non stick coating began to peel off. By eight months, the coating pieces began showing up in my egg. I had to throw the pan away. I have an older 12"" Anolon that I have gone back to. The Anolon is over 2 years old the non-stick surface is just fine. I like the size and design of the 10"" Calphalon. It is just not as reliable."
5,What an awesome pan for an awesome price!,"I have owned restaurants and therefore am pretty demanding when it comes to cookware and knives after having used top of the line professional equipment. I saw this pan as I was looking to replace my Wolfgang Puck pan that started losing it's ""non-stick"" after 1.5 years. When I saw the list price on this I thought I should give it a try considering it's drastic price reduction. Although it did take over a week to arrive, it arrived in perfect condition and worked wonderfully this morning for omelettes. It was also a bit bigger than I expected! It's a nice heavy pan but my only complaint is the sleek metal handle is a big hard to hold onto and work with and I wish it was a bigger handle. A pan of this quality would be at least $40+ at any department store and this quality cannot be found at Wal-mart. I would recommend it both as a gift and for personal use."
3,great size,I loved the skillet when i first got it and thought the non-stick would last forever. I'm finding pitting in the non-stick surface now even though I've been very careful not to use any non-stick sprays and have been careful to clean it properly. The size is great for eggs in the morning. I just wish the surface would have held up better.
5,Best price during Firday Only Sale,"Watch for the $19.99 price during Amazon's Friday Only sale. Great non-stick pan for that price. Beware that it is made in China, not the usual Calphalon production. And note the size - rather small so if you are looking for a family size pan, skip this one."
2,Good for the first year...,"Bought this two years ago and there is a significant amount of the teflon coating that has ended up in my food. After about 1 year it started to come off and now I don't want to use it any more. Great price, but Cast Iron will last forever and not end up in my food. Back to using Lodge, FOR GOOD!"
2,Hard to Handle,"OK, like everyone else I read all the reviews before deciding on this pan. And everyone was right about the phenomenal properties of this nonstick. However, no one seemed to mention that the handle is far from ergonomically correct. It is way too small for the heft of this pan. The pan actually turns over in my hand when I'm lifting it, and I'm not a tiny person with small hands. I'm sticking with the professional line until I see some design changes. C'mon, Calphalon, do some homework!! And in spite of what anyone says about the professional becoming less than nonstick over time, I've had mine for over a year, and with daily use it's still like new. Take good care of it, and remember there's a lifetime warranty against defect."
3,3 Years in and non-stick kaput...,"I've had this pan for 3 years now and it's never seen a dishwasher, metal utensil, or steel wool. The finish is wearing away nonetheless and it's non-stick properties are history. I still use it with non-stick spray because of the size and convenience, but I won't buy it again. All my commercial hard anodized Calphalon still looks great and performs wonderfully (I got a boatload when they were on clearance), but I won't try the non-stick again."
3,"Good pan, bad handling","I have three crepe pans. One is an Anolon, one is Member's Mark (Sam's Club) and this is the third. Unfortunately it came out as number three on the rankings not because of it's crepe making, but because of its handling. The crepes come out great and I have no problem with the surface or heat conduction, but the handle is unforgivable. It is narrow and makes the pan very difficult to maneuver. For $20, it's a steal, but I'd buy three more if there was a better handle (I make a LOT of crepes)."
3,"Perfect size pan for eggs, etc.","This is the perfect pan for making eggs, grilled cheese,et. I picked this up on a Friday special for $19.99. It's worth it with free shipping. The only thing I dislike is the cheap non-stick coating. I thought it would be Teflon, but it's some cheap coating instead."
4,Works well good pan for the price,We have used this pan for over a month now and no problems to report. Solidly built and non-stick surface seems durable and works well. No complaints at this point.
5,Caphalon pan,I love this pan. We use it to cook everything. Clean up is a breeze. I highly recommend this product.
4,Handy kitchen item,This griddle pan is of a nice quality and of sturdy construction. Fairly light weight and cleans easily.
4,just what I needed,"A very nice pan, easy to clean. Shallower than I was expecting, but otherwise perfect, for omlettes, pancakes, steak."
2,Nonstick? Really?,"I've followed the directions on use and care of this thing and since I got it in 2006, it's never really been ""nonstick"". It's impossible to clean up when cooking anything. I actually think it may be defective so I just wrote Calphalon for warranty replacement. Based upon my experience, I wouldn't get this pan again, nor would I ever get any sort of nonstick product."
2,Non-Stick No More,"First, to be fair, I want to be upfront and say I put this pan in the dishwasher. Honestly, I do this with all my non-stick pots and pans because I find it cheaper( cost = time, energy, and money ) to put non-stick pans in the dishwasher and just replace them every X years as needed. T-Fal is really the only company I can find that claims there pans are non-stick and dishwasher safe. I can say that although that may not be entirely true they will last and be fully non-stick for a very long time before they need to be replaced and they do have a lifetime warranty for the frugal minded. This pan didn't even make it through one or two washings, which for me really draws into question of the quality of the pan. Of course the warranty is void by putting it in the dishwasher and sadly the only use for a sticky crepe pan is to take up space in a landfill. Would someone please make a high quality, glass lid, oven safe handled, nonstick set of pots and pans, pretty please!!!"
4,"Useful, but small",I found this pan very useful for my crepe needs. The non stick part is good. I only wish it was a little bigger in size and was dishwasherable. But it's definitely a good addition to your cutlery.
1,One time use only,"This is a disposable piece of junk. I had high hopes in the beginning. Before I put it on the stove. The first time, it started to stick. Yes I use only plastic utensils. But the poor quality reflects badly on Caphalon since they are supposedly high end. I had better luck with $5 pans. Take a pass on this. If it were so heavy, I wouldve returned it."
1,Butter sticks to this pan,I puchased this pan along with a few others after being under the false impression that it was of superior quality. It is heavy and solidly built but the non-skid coating is junk. I have never put it in the dishwasher and always washed with care but after a couple of months the non skid was nonfunctional. I mean everything sticks to this pan....very frustrating. I have since purchased a Scanpan skillet and it workes 10 times better for alot less $$
3,Average at Best,"This crepe pan/griddle was purchased years ago from Amazon. This item had just turned up in search results as I was researching a new purchase. Why not a review...The finish didn't last long at all, maybe 3-4 months at best. We all know that the smallest little scratch on this type of surface leads to quick deterioration. Truth be told - we need better technology that won't inadvertently poison us.This pan is very shallow, make sure you have a specific purpose in mind if willing to invest the money. Wicked for making crepes or pancakes ... .... . . $79!? I felt as if I overpaid back in '06 when I spent $29."
3,Just opened the box,I just opened the box containing this pan. It smells awful and has a nasty metallic powder all over it. I'll have to think about keeping this pan.Made in China
3,Good pan but too small,"We've had this pan for a couple months. Its quality seems good, but we found it too small and shallow for serious cooking, e.g. stir fries."
5,Restored My Faith in Nonstick Pans,"I recently purcahsed this pan from Amazon, and I couldn't be more happy! I've been a hard-core Nonstick protester for most of my life, but I thought I'd give it another shot. This pan has excellent heat distribution and cooks as flawlessly as my stainless steel pans. Both the nonstick and hard anodized surfaces clean easily and barely require much more than a rinse. I like the size because it's large enough for crepes, quesadillas, etc...but still small enough to use for a few eggs. Transferring to the oven is great, but would be easier with an opposing handle. Overall, I love this pan!!!"
4,Wife loves it,"My wife has always said all non-stick pans are the same until I bought this for her. It's solid, the handle has not gotten hot yet, and it continues to be non-stick. I do wish that we could put it in the dishwasher."
3,"I am disappointed,","This is my first item of Calaphon. I love my Technique hard annodized cookware, but always thought Calaphon was the top of the line. However, I recently purchased this pan and have been very disappointed, especially with the nonstick surface. Specifically, I cooked scrambled eggs, and thought I would never get it clean. I will stick to Technique, thanks."
2,not that durable,"in very poor condition (flaking of surface) after 4 years. my 10 yr old Calphalon Commercial Nonstick saucepan is still doing fine, so i wonder if quality standards dropped after mfg moved offshore."
5,Great nonstick griddle,"I purchased this pan predominantly to make pancakes. It is such a handy griddle pan that I find myself using it for everything. The size, weight and even heat make this a great all around pan."
4,pleased,Much lighter than the 12 inch which I found to heavy. Sides are a little low and the rivets that hold the handle are NOT non stick. This means food sticks here.
1,Not useful,"I was under the impression this was a different, larger pan when I brought it, and after realizing my mistake (i.e., after opening the box) it was too expensive to return.This pan is too small for regular cooking, and too steep sided for making crepes. It is also too small for making breakfast for a family. The nonstick coating is inferior to the anodized line, and the pan still can't be washed in the dishwasher. For $3 more, you can get a real pan, one you can use every day for 15 years for every type of cooking (14"" anodized skillet w/ lid)that heats evenly and cooks wonderfully."
1,Calphalon griddle/crepe pan,"This is my 2nd Calphalon investment and I am enjoying cooking in these pans immensely.They are so versatile, clean- up is a Breeze and any/all foods I have used these pans for has turned out great."
2,Very disappointed!,"I've been using Calphalon and Circulon products for the past 16+ years and so far this has been one of my very big disappointments. It should not be categorized as ""commercial"" because a chef would have thrown it out of the window after just a couple of uses!!!"
5,"Great product, inconsistent price","The pan is just as good as everyone says. I have purchased many over the years. The problem is, if you're not careful, you can really overpay. I've seen it priced between $18. to $30 and then back to $18.. All at Amazon."
5,A great kitchen pan for daily use,"This is a great pan for small family of 2-3 people. Makes great pancakes, egg omlets, tortilla, etc. It's a bit shallow for stir fry, but still useable if you want to make sautee mushrooms or something in that nature.Non-stick, I've used it only for a few weeks, so not sure how long it lasts. But just from looking at the finish and the few weeks of use, it looks to last a fairly long time. Typically have to change the cheap non-stick pans every 6-10 month, this one costs about $10 more, but the material really looks like it's going to last at least 2x longer."
3,meh,I still use it for frying things with grease and other nonstick things like sausage but for the price the nonstick was not very good or long lasting
4,Good,"This is one of the first purchases for my kitchen. I had breakfast foods in mind. Earlier trials with non-stick cookware resulted in frusration as the teflon coating wore off & the pans never really worked well as they did'nt retain heat.Inexpensive, nice clean design with a stay cool handle & the non stick surface is easy to keep clean. A little on the heavier side, the pan performs beautifully after it's heated for a few minutes as the retained heat allows foods to cook better/faster. Have had it for two years now, and used it to cook eggs, crepes, pancakes & warm up foods. A good pan at a great price."
4,good - recommended,"this is light weight, easy to clean, not too big, ideal for omlettes or indian flat breads"
5,Great addition to your kitchen!,I love Calphalon to begin with and this is just another great pan available. It is heavy but it is built solid and for use. Heats evenly and handle stays cool to the touch. Great pan to finish off items in the oven. I think this is a great pan for doing egg crepes.
4,Great performance/value ratio,"A versatile pan that stows easily, heats evenly, and cleans up quickly. Since we don't make crepes, I wish the sides were a bit taller."
5,calphalon grill/crepe pan,If you think that what you cook in doesn't make a difference you have got to try this pan.Wonderful even heat nonstick and the food just tastes better.
5,I love Calphalon.,My neighbor turned me on to Calphalon about a year ago and they are amazing! The best quality and the cooking heat is so even. They also clean up real nice and if you have a tough spot you can buy the Calphalon cleaner and it works great! I have a large collection of these pans now and they make cooking even more fun.
5,A Great Omlette Pan!,My first Calphalon purchase and for a great price on Amazon. Makes great omlettes and grilled cheese. A perfect 10 inch size skillet for my smooth surface cook top. Extremely easy clean up and the non-stick surface is perfect!! Will look for more items similar to this in hopefully as good a price range on Amazon. Purchased additional's of this item for gifts.
2,Scratches easily,I bought this pan in hopes that it would be more durable than other nonstick pans I have tried. Not so. It scratches very easily. You can't forget to use plastic utensils. One use of a metal fork to stir something and the pan is scratched. Also if you burn something in the pan it is very difficult to get clean (and it takes some the nonstick off even when you use a dobi pad and softscrub as recommended by the manufacturer).
5,"Good price, great weight....","Great product, can't beat the price! Great for everyday uses, like grilled cheese!"
4,Collection of American Classics,A good collection of American classical songs. Well recorded and good performances. Not a toe-tapper though; it's more like going to the opera.
3,Okay but would have like more vocals,"I was looking for more vocal music , more songs to sing along with but there is more instrumental music then what I expected. The song selection is great and what singing there is I enjoy but I wanted more."
2,way too intense,"I needed a traditional CD of patriotic songs to teach my Girl Scout troop but they wouldn't listen to this one past the first song. It is way to intense. The huge orchestra and the operatic voices,although truly beautiful, will not appeal to a mass audience."
4,A Song for Dr. Rose by Margaret Holt (Large Print Mills & Boon Medical Romance),"Description from the book back cover:Dr. Rose Gillis knew that Dr. Leigh McDowie spelled trouble! Although a medical registrar, and senior to her in rank, he wanted a refresher in obstetrics, and that meant she would be his boss on the maternity ward at Beltonshaw General Hospital. Leigh's medical skills were excellent, but Rose found his laid-back attitude and flirtatious sense of humor hard to handle. They also had fundamental working differences, but, despite that, Leigh was a tower of strength when she needed him. Perhaps there was more to Leigh than Rose would let herself believe ..."
2,Poor workmenship,"On both chair the holes for screws did not align at all on the top back of chair, and new holes had to be drilled."
4,Nice chairs,"Assembly was fairly easy, no missing hardware, comfortable to sit on. The preservative smell (and tackiness) disappeared after the chairs spent the night on the porch. They don't wobble and they look okay. No regrets here"
4,Nothing Lost In Translation Here,This is a great book for any Shavian scholar to own. The themes and philosophies of George Bernard Shaw's last full length play are examined with great care. The book is comprehensive and thorough. It provides valuable insight into Shaw's process of revision and as to how the text changed in translation. This book is a great resource for a Masters Thesis or Doctoral Dissertation.
3,poor writing style bogs down reading,"I love Chuck Berry and was eager to read his memoirs. I came away with mixed feelings.I liked that he tells stories about writing his greatest songs. That was a good chapter. Also intriguing were his scrapes with racism, his (many) dalliances with women over the years, and his prison terms in the early-60s and late-70s. Does he reveal everything? Of course not. No autobiography does, but he can be candid.What I didn't like was Chuck's clumsy writing style with run-on sentences, use of arcane words when simpler ones would've sufficed, and weird changes in active/passive voice. His style comes off as pretentious and distracts the reader from what he's trying to say. (I actually preferred Springsteen's foreword which told a good story in clear terms.)For hardcore Berry fans, really."
4,Chuck Berry is Rock and Roll,"Like most autobiographies, Chuck's is rather self serving, and his writing style may dismay some, but hey, this is a rock and roll legend, not an English major.Chuck writes about his early musical influences by performers such as Louis Jordan, his meeting with Muddy Waters, and how he came to write many of his hits. The origin of the famous ""duck walk"" is told and Chuck tells about his brushes with the law.I am not alone in my opinion that he is the most important R&R; figure of the twentieth century. I believe it was John Lennon who said that if you needed another name for R&R; it could be Chuck Berry, most fans will thoroughly this book."
5,Purchase and Share,"""If an adult calls you teacher...""--buy this book.Feeling isolated teaching in a college? Wondering if your school is the only one treating faculty so poorly? Berry helps us see the big picture and provides strategies for essentially saving the American higher ed. system."
3,OK,"If you are looking to learn Assembler, this is definitely the text for you. It kind of breezes over the basics. I would like to have seen more example circuits."
1,Boring,"From the very beginning this documentary seemed like it droned on and on. From the monotone voices to the inaccuracies reported, this documentary was horrible written and horribly put together. It was a waste of money and a waste of time. The only good thing about this is that it put me to sleep within 20 minutes."
2,Too Basic for a College Text,"Though the selections in this book are excellent and unexpected, Birkerts seems in his analyses to be overly elementary. He draws too many concrete inferences from ambiguous material and situations. I'm quite dissapointed with his analyses..... they seem much better suited as introductory high school texts than college ones. His analyses and writings about his chosen subject seem rather dry. I reccomend this text only for its selection of international authors whom I may not have discovered had it not been for this text. The content of discussion is dismissible, however. As an alternative, I suggest Ciardi's ""How Does A Poem Mean?"" He covers basically the same territory, but does so with passion and an obvious joy in the unnailable. A much more thoughtful treatment, ultimately leaving the task of determining meaning & appreciation of a piece (or Performance, as he explains) to the reader."
5,Where Was This Book When I Was A Teen?,"Alex Packer has written a funny, educational, and comprehensive book on alternatives to getting high with alcohol or other drugs. The book includes examples of alternative highs from teenagers along with humorous illustrations and up-to-date links to websites. I hadn't realized how many non-chemical alternatives there were to getting high. I can't wait to pass this book on to my teenage nephew. I only wish such a book had been available when I was his age!"
4,"Other reviewers are misled, this is a solid gun.","First of all, the other reviewers are, for the most part, not active airsoft enthusiasts.This is an M249 SAW, not some M4 that you do recon with and certainly not some low grade spring gun for a backyard skirmish. The purpose of the SAW is to lay down cover fire, not give you 700fps out of the box.I've played with other players who own one of these, and it is a very good gun. It's a real beast on the field but obviously not for the beginner. I've been shot by it and if you think that ""350fps is nothing"" then you have another thing coming. And to those complaining about the price, do some research first. It's $900 for a reason."
4,Great gun except the price,this is a good gun and needed for any airsoft war but it is slightly over priced i bought a clone for under $300 on airsplat which is slightly better because it comes upgraded and it comes with the 2400 round electric box mag
4,about the SAW,that other kid id right if u play in a team depending on the size u need one. myself i have been playing for about 5 years. my team has 3 of the things and let me tell u if u are trying to get up the feild u want some on who can put the knid of fire power down so u need a saw. I have a SAW like this and it is great durable becasue of medal (more money) i have had plastic don't get them they break. I also have a full meadl m16 with M203. with ups and extras about $600. treats me nice. hope this helps
3,the guns a air rifle nota airsoft,the gosh DANG GUN IS NOT AN AIRSOFT GUN ITS A FREAKIN AIR RIFLE. I GOT ONE OF THESE AFTER 5 YEARS OF HARD LABOR. IT LOOKED SO COOL I HAD TO GET IT. I SHOOTS THE THINGS REAL FAST AND KILLS.
4,Finding time for love,I enjoyed this book because it wove into the story line being a Big Sister which is a volunteer organization I hope to get involved in. Casey James is a social worker who is very serious about her job. She finds herself attracted to Alfred Willingham who is a very successful buy man. Alfred is willing to try to make room in his schedule for a woman he falls in love with and his daughter.He has to prove he can put his family before his business. Not always easy to do.
4,First-rate recording at an exquisite price...,"This CD is the first of the two. The recording is high quality, and the singing is superb (for plainsong). At less than seven dollars, this CD is one you must add to your library - if only for the 'Miserere' and the 'Pange lingua'!"
4,Very good buy,"-First off, each chant is very similar. I personally don't mind that, and if you listen to them you will pick up on the unique differences of each.-Very good buy, well worth it.-If you like chant, definitely go for it."
4,beautiful,"This cd is amazing in the fact that it doesn't come with the normal cristian dogma.It's entirly in latin and it takes me back to a time only a few years after Crist graced this earth. The time this chanting is from is a pure time, a time that came before the church established it's hierarchy.The chanting is fluid and fills one with a peace and escape from this often stressful and busy world."
3,Early Glasgow,"Nick Burr is the son of a poor farmer; he is about to apprentice in a law firm when he decides to take a job in a store instead (his family needs the money). He gets involved in politics and is dynamic and honest, and soon rises to the governor's chair. Later he is killed by a mob about to lynch a black man as he tries to intervene to stop it. Nick's love is for Eugenia Battle, whom he pursues throughout the novel; she is an upper-class girl who decides to marry within her own class and Nick's loss. Already in this early novel Glasgow is establishing two of her major themes as a writer: the role of race and class in Southern society. Her gift as a writer is evident here, though the story is slow in spots. Better efforts were to come."
2,Replace the O with an A,One more example of an album I bought years ago because of the artificial hype. The reviews at the time said this was great. It wasn't. It isn't. Boring.
2,"Decent, but completely full of itself","The book has some nice simple recipes, although it is not written in a ""simple"" way. This is a good $5 used book, not a $20 new one.The preface is demanding and esoteric and was a total turn-off. The Preface is written in a manner that reminds me of Joyce, yet the difficulty in deciphering it is almost a lesson in futility. My advice, skip the preface and enjoy the recipes.The Jaques Pepin books are much easier to read and use."
3,Too Wordy,"This is a good book if you are interested in studying foods and ways to cook, not necessarily quick and simple recipes. For the amateur chef, like myself, this book tends to make assumptions that you know many cooking definitions. I found the book too wordy. The recipes I have made are delicious and are truly French."
2,"Nothing ""simple"" about it","Preparing cow brains and eels might be simple for some, but most will find this a very impractical guide to French cooking. ""Pretentious French Food,"" would be a more appropriate title."
5,Simple French Food by Richard Olney,"An inspirational classic with for the most part simple, tasty recipes imbibed with the essence & tradition of French cooking. Whatever other favorite cookbooks you have it's a relief to dip into this small volume to charge the cooking batteries & be amazed at old traditional yet fresh & superb ways of dealing with simple favorites like eggs, pork, soups salads etc, it's about the essence of food & taste & not just a string of recipes, Alice Waters called it her inspiration for Chez Panisse & cooked from it for 20 years, Nuff said. If you love to cook get it immediately why waste time being without it? & it's inexpensive in paperback."
2,low budget redneck action flick,This review is for the Amazon VOD rental of this film. This is a low budgetaction flick about bootleg alcohol in the deep south. It has a decent storyline and ok acting but does not provide any real thrills. This kind of filmgives Rednecks a bad name.
5,Favorite router base,This is the off-table base I use the most. It's comfortable and being able to turn the router on without taking my hands off the handle is great.I have all three bases. The fixed base is mounted under my router table. The plunge base I use when it is necessary. This base is the one the router motor sits in most of the time.
3,Bat a problem,"We have purchased this product before and for some reason we always have problems with the bat. I think the quality of the bat could be upgraded because it seems if you hit the balls too hard, the bat loses a connection to the machine or even breaks in two. My boys love playing with it, but the life of the bat is always in question."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS TOY!!!!,"It was given to my 7 yr. old as a gift. We thought, this will be the best ever. It was so poorly manufactured that we weren't even able to get it to function. When we tried to contact the company, we discovered that they have filed for bankruptcy so we a stuck holding the bag. AGAIN< DO NOT BUY THIS TOY!"
4,fun patriotic music,"My daughter (6) has had this CD for two years. She still likes it. Recently listened on a long car ride with grandparents who recognized many of the songs and were happy to sing along, which amused my daughter."
4,Great price but I think there is a hidden agenda,90% of these songs are great. The production and quality is good. Kids love the sound and it isn't too tiresome for kids. My problems is that 10% of the songs have very religious messages which is not clear on the labeling. I deleted these from my playlist (I ripped the CD to my ipod) and it is OK. I have no problem with religious songs I just want to know what I am buying
1,Great for church or school!,Delivery was quick so that I could use it right away and the quality is super!
3,Great for Summer Fun,"I'm teaching 3 year olds this summer and our summer theme is ""America the Beautiful"". I downloaded this for my kids to listen to, and they love it. They especially love singing and dancing to Yankee Doodle and the Star Spangled Banner while marching around the room. I would def recommend this CD to any teacher of young children."
2,Poor Recording Quality/Scratched from Amazon,"I read the reviews about the poor quality of the recording and I hate to say it, but it's true. Some of the chants have a choppy, ""Luuke I am your faaahtha"" fan sound to them that truly does mimic what it sounds like when you sing into a fan. I don't know if it was an effect or what, but it's distracting. Also several portions of 2 songs skip and I ordered this disc from Amazon, brand new.Overall, the chants are lovely and it's what I wanted on that level, BUT had I known it would skip and have the fan effect, I would've purchased a different recording/CD."
5,Gregorian Chants: The Best of the Benedictine Monks of St. Michael's,"The CD was in perfect shape, was shipped very promptly and I have enjoyed listening to it - especially when feeling stressed."
5,cd order,"This order arrived super fast, the price was good, the product as described and I am completely satisfied with this purchase."
4,nice and mellow,Bought this as a Christmas gift for my husband. He loved it and wanted to buy more. Would highly recommend to those who like chants.
2,"Bargain--but, bargain as I expected.","There are various kinds of music but a calm and monotones of in 49 minutes. Judging from the CD, it seemd that the Director had something expectatins for the work. For example, ringing bell, resounding chorus, by instruments... But, they could not make me feel meditation at all.The terribly echo rather spoiled a feeling of a space. It is not profound, but is simply unclear. In the end it spoiled the calm of the whole work. I do not recommend."
5,"Beautiful, with great depth of sound","One really hears the passion and life in the voices of these monks--keep in mind that this is not merely a group of singers who have assembled in the studio to record a CD, but rather, men whose lives are totally wrapped up in the mysteries of which they sing. I can really hear their struggles and love for God in their chants, and their harmonies are creative and sweet to the ear. True, if one is not familiar with this type of music--Gregorian Chant--it may sound a little spooky and strangely other-wordly. I would encourage the listener to look up on the Internet the portions of the Latin mass that are on this CD--the Gloria (#11), for example, and read the words in English along to sound of the song. That way, you can have a sense of the things about which the monks sing, which will bridge the distance between the listener and this genre of music."
2,Unbiased reponse to Caesarmagnus,"Agreed, the fan IS there, but I must admit they are actually singing well in the actual Solesmes style (based on these samples). I have heard superb chant and frighteningly bad chant. This is not as bad as it gets I assure you. Try to find something from a Seminary or Monastery."
5,Very Nice,"This is an excellent CD. Much better than the Benedictine Monks of Santo Domingo De Silos. St. Michael's are much more melodic, with better harmonies. The use of bells also helps."
4,very nice,"I've got a Jornada 548 and a Handspring Visor and recently got the Palm m505. It is by far the best handheld computer I've used. The color screen is not quite bright enough indoors unless the backlight is turned on. Outside the screen is much better than the handspring. The color screen is not needed unless you've got color images you need to store.The Palm 4.0 OS is a slight improvement over the other Palm OS versions. It is a well designed product, compact and functional."
3,Needs a brighter screen,"After using the Handspring Visor Standard for the past year I decided to upgrade to a Palm Computer with 8Mb of memory. I have been a fan of the size and weight of the Palm V but preferred the expandability and the ease of the USB cradle of the Handspring products. When I saw information on the new Palm M500 and M505 I figured it would be the best of both worlds, a Palm V with the benefits of a Handspring Visor. Seeing that there was only a $50 difference between the mono and color units I decided to go color.After using it for the past two days I whish I saved the $50 and went with the M500 instead. The color display is so washed out looking it's hard to even tell that it is color. Other than the display I am very pleased with the product. Syncing with the USB cradle is a snap. The faster processor is noticeably quicker than my old Handspring Visor when trying to perform a find function in a large address database."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS!!,"I am so glad that I went to the store before I bought this item. Currently, I have the PALM IIIC and I like it a lot. The only option that I wish it had was an expansion slot like the Visor products. Along comes the M505 solving the expansion slot problem and I really wanted to trade up. I went Best Buy to get a demo and let me tell you, the screen is awful. It is very dim and even with the backlight on, it doesn't compare to the IIIC. Save your money. I opted for the Visor Prism instead."
2,Screen not bright,The unit appeared to work fine but the screen just is not bright enough to do any work with. I returned it to the vendor and he is in the process of swapping it with a unit from another manufacturer.
3,Ehh...,"I bought two M505 for my staff as soon as they came out earlier this year. I have mixed feelings for this product. As you may know, the M505 comes with a USB cradle. About 2 weeks after I bought my Palms, one of them stop Syncing. After a while with technical support, they sent me a whole new unit. Again after about 3 weeks, it again stopped syncing. Again, I called tech support and again they sent me a new one. Wouldn't you know that it stopped again!This time, instead of reexplaining myself with Palm support for the third time, I bought a serial cradle. I haven't had problems since.A couple of months later a friend won a Palm M505. It sycronized once, and can you guess.... it stopped working. This time I knew.My palm experiences have left me a little shaken. If you have to buy a Palm M505, be ready to buy a serial cradle."
3,"Satisfying gadget, but steep cost.","The reigning king of PDAs, at least for now. The device comes with 16MB of memory - and a small removable storage slot for additional space - more than enough room for phone numbers, appointments and applications. The color screen is crisp and clear, though the backlighting is fairly dim. In addition, the m505 rates high on the 'coolness' scale with a sleek design that rivals gadget king Sony. Still, the price is steep. And with recent introductions of a new generation of PDAs by HP, Sony and Compaq, the m505's time at the top may be waning. If you can find the right price, I say go for it."
4,"Not as improved as I expected for the ""next generation""","I am a loyal Palm user and I will say this, the m505 is better then the Palm V which I previously owned. The problem was I expected the improvements to be more...spectacular. There are improvements: memory cards, color, improved speed. But they are better in the sense of an upgrade, not a new line all together. This is Palm 1.1 NOT 2.0. Think upgrade and you have the right idea, maybe even that this is a beta version, but not that this is the next new thing. Its not new, its tweeked. If you are new to Palms or digital assitants you will love this and wonder why the other people are so disappointed. If you have had a PDA for a while you will probably expect more."
4,How you use it drives the M505's suitability,"The biggest issue around the M505 has to be the screen. While the color intensity/brightness is no match for the Clie (for Palm platform) or the Casio E-125 (PocketPC platform) it is still the best form factor for use in a work environment where portability and minimal size is key. While the color screen is far from vivid, it is respectable. Palm has posted an application modification that will allow you to leave the backlight on whenever the unit is powered up. Even with the light on, the unit only needs charging every 3-4 days with moderate daily use. The M505 provides an acceptable color screen for 90% of the applications. The shortfall is if you opt to use the M505 for pictures or intense gaming. There it falls short and you should look to the Sony or a PocketPC. For daily use as a PDA (datebook, contact list, etc.) it's a great choice."
2,Disappointed!,"I've waited for a month with great anticipation of upgrading my Palm to the new Palm M505. I picked it up today and what a disappointment!! The screen is so dark and muted it is more difficult to see than my current monochrome screen. The styling is great and up to now I have been loyal to Palm, but I'm taking the M505 back today and buying a Handspring Visor."
1,"Do not buy this, fatal design flaw","I cannot believe that a company like Palm would let this happen. I have owned others (III & V) which work fine. The problem with the m505 is that the buttons below the screen (calendar, phone, etc) are not recessed, so when you close the cover with the slightest pressure, the buttons get pressed, the Palm gets turned on again. Once it is on any pressure on the scroll key keeps it running (you can hear it clicking away) and in no time the battery is dead.I got one for a friend who spent hours entering his 200 names & addresses etc while we were on a trip. Then he recharged it, put it in his suitcase and one week later when he opened it up again the battery was dead and all the memory had been erased. Totally unacceptable! I think the whole m505 line should be recalled."
2,Disappointing,"I have used Palm for several years having beenn disappointed by the demise of the Apple Newton. My palm V and then my palm 111C worked for me flawlessly. I have now ""upgraded"" to the Palm m505 and have just sent in my third return. Not one of my new palm m505 has synchronized properly. One of them didn't even go on right out of the box. My brother also bought a m505 also and he has just sent for a replacement, having experienced similar problems. The color is also disappointing and pails in comparison to the color of the 111c. If my next exchange is also deffective I will ask for a refund, and think about an alternative product."
4,better than the Palm V,"I love my palm V, but ran out of memory. I am a physician and use the Epocrates and Qid programs which exceed the 2MB available on the PalmV. The m505 works just as well as the V with a few improvements: more memory, an expansion slot which I have not needed yet, a color screen(very faint color, but still an improvement over black and green), much faster hot synching and a few nice touches like being able to store photos. So far, it is just as reliable as my palm, the software installed flawlessly and kept all my prior settings so I didn't need to reconfigure my mail settings(I use Outlook 2000)."
2,What color? Where's the wireless?,"I can only rate the screen as [terrible]... to call this dull display color is a joke. Where's the contrast adjustment, don't bother - there isn't one! I can't believe anyone is building their 'flagship' PDA without either built in wireless or a PCMCIA slot to add a wireless modem. The 'mobile Internet' option doesn't count - dragging around a data ready cell phone with a connecting cable is not 'wireless'. They better improve with the v 5.0 OS and upcoming models... or they're done. By the way the incompatible cradle data connector is one more bad move."
3,Definite weaknesses,"The display and the battery are definite weaknesses. I'm surprised this model is still offered since the advent of the m515.Otherwise, the basic Palm is great for organizing. Great for the busy person, or someone who needs reminders. This model at 8MB has room for more games than anyone needs, or some more useful applications. I have 2 versions of the Bible and still plenty of room."
2,Try the Pocket PC first!,"If you are debating between a Pocket PC and a PALM the Pocket PC wins hands down. We have both in our household and the advantages of the Pocket PC are many. For example, go to your local retailer and try out the handwriting recognition. The Pocket PC's is almost flawless and does not require anything other than gradeschool letters. The special characters for ordinary letters required by the PALM often don't work and the screen always seems to need to be realigned. You don't need to use an extra stroke for numbers or capitals on the Pocket PC. And word compleation is a real timesaver over the PALM. The calander is much easier to read and the display looks much more professional. There is a great deal more functionality, with the ability to read and create Word and Excel documents. Games are better as well.And if you have a Palm and run out of battery, LOOK OUT. If you didn't sync recently, you may lose everything, which just happened with our household PALM!"
1,Dim Display,The display is more disappointing than reviews mention. You will think it is monochrome instead of color when you see or use it.
4,Brilliant colors? Not so!!,"This is my second Palm. I had the PalmIII XE before I purchased the PalmM505. I wanted the updated operating system, but I chose the M505 because I thought the screen would be easier to see than the monochrome screen, since the color screens appeared cleared. Yet for all the price, the screen on the M505 is not clear, even with the ""front light"" on. It is not as clear as the Palm IIIC. Palm is aware of this problem, yet they continue to advertise that it has ""brilliant color"". Everything else about the M505 is great, but if you don't want to be disapointed in the screen, buy the monochrome or black and white one (M500)."
1,HotSync problem!,Do not buy this product. HotSync problem due to electrostatic discharge. Shoddy help. I lost my back-up file on my PC after they suggested I uninstall the software (and uninstalled my personal data). This ESD problem is not easily fixable and they will not simply replace your handheld. Would stay away from Palm. I am going to get a PocketPC.
1,m505 has issues.,"Palm is not posting facts about the m505. The m505 can at times develop a hotsync problem. Users who get replacement devices have limited success with them. I received a replacement device today and the hotsync did not work. Palm has not FAQ's on their web site addressing the problem and generally seem to want to cover it up. Not every one has these problems but more people have them then should.With having Palm cover up these issues, and the only resolution being to use a serial cradle for slower syncing why would you want to buy one?When the device works it's pretty good, a semi-fast processor, back-light is a bit weak, battery life is good. But remember the potential you have for future problems."
2,Hmmmmmm,"I too have owned several palms and frankly I am quite disappointed. Considering the availability of other Palm OS and Windows CE PDAs, I am surprised Palm even bothered coming out with this one. It lacks so many features that other models on the market have had for a while now. As mentioned above, the quality of the color screen is probably THE biggest disappointment. Also, the lack of compatability with older international kits etc is a big bummer. I too will most likely be shifting to a Windows CE PDA after this one unless Palm gets their act together.Memory is a factor but the expansion slot meant nothing to me..."
3,Where are all the accessories?,"When I bought the m505 Palm, my decision was based upon the review by editors here. Unfortunately, I didn't check to see if accessories were available. Sure, the catalog touts several neat things such as the new auxillary memory cards, etc. But something as simple as a travel charge kit cannot be found locally. I haven't been able to find these on Amazon either. Everywhere I go, there are tons of accessories for the older Palm models, but very few for the newer ones. No wonder Palm is taking a hit in the stock market. There is obviously a glut of older stuff in inventories, and nothing for the new models.If I had it to do over again, I probably would have purchased the HP for about the same price."
4,"great for an organizer, poor for a gameboy","I'm glad to own the m505 personally. I agree that the screen is less vivid than some other color handhelds, but its bautiful in direct sunlight, also unlike some other handhelds. It looks sleek and refined, and unlike the prism it doesn't look like a glorified gameboy. While the contrast of the screen could have been made adustable, i like everything about my m505 so far... especially its performance and price (at $100 less than the new clie)"
3,"sweet, but not worth the money","First reaction on using the new m505 is that it looks sexy, has a great screen, and will offer major improvements over its predecessors. Unfortunately it does not live up to that expectation.For the money, the older V series offers everything significant but the color screen, and I actually found the screen on the V to be easier to read! And since that V is now... less than the m505, its a no brainer.I don't think that Palm put in enough new features to justify the expense. Its all sizzle and no steak. Save your money and keep your old Palm, or buy the V series and put (money) into your pocket."
4,M505 is getting an unjustified bad wrap,"There seem to be a lot of comments about the M505's bad color screen. I have had mine for one week now and am not disappointed at all. After all it's a PDA not a high definition television. For what it does I think it's excellent. My only reservation so far is that most of the software out there for the palm O/S is still B&W. I am however expecting this to improve with all the color models coming out this summer. I think the package as a whole is leek and elegant.Basically, I am very happy and it was well worth the wait."
3,"Good Device, but one serious problem","Overall, I like my m505. I had no problems with it until yesterday, when it stopped hotsyncing with the USB cradle. I researched this on the web, and it turns out it's a known problem caused by static discharge.Palm will exchange the device (and the cradle), but youget a refurbished palm pilot. This means that somebody else used and abused it (and ultimately zapped it). There have been quality problems with these.More to the point, it's just a temporary fix... the problems can and do occur again. Check out the horror stories on the web, particularly at places like palminfocenter.comThe good news: This doesn't seem to affect the serial interface. That's what I use now. It's slower, but more reliable. And for a tool such as this, isn't reliability the most important virtue it can have?"
2,"Great PDA, Bad Color!","The Palm 505 is a great PDA, but the color, the brightness and the contrast needs a lot of work. The 505 is just like any other palm, versatile, useful and all and it really is a good Palm except for the screen which is half the reason why you buy a unit! I can't help but compare the 505 with the 3C... they are worlds apart. Why can't palm put 3C's screen on a 505? THe 515 is better, but not that much better. I suggest you wait until Palm comes out with a better screen."
3,Christmas gift to Husband.,"I took a quick peek at what the screen looks like since it had poor ratings. In my opinion, since the product is so small, we should not expect the detail of a large screen. It appears to be bright enough to read, but it does need to moved around to compensate for lighting around you."
3,Want to love it ..... Can't,"I purchased this handheld about a week ago. I upgraded from a Vx. With the back light on, it is AWESOME! Unfortunately, the back light does not help in office lighting or overcast daylight. Without the back light I am afraid I will go blind trying to use this product. I am going to hold onto it, however, and hope that Palm comes to it's sensed and publishes an O/S patch to allow for contrast adjustment or recall the unit for hardware repair/upgrade.Palm, if you are listening, do the right thing and fix this!"
3,poor screen visability,"The new technology for longer battery time has created a screen with poor color and contrast. The overall poor visibility is very disappointing, because it's function capacity and size are wonderful. Posssibly, palm could create a program to improve the m505's color and contrast."
3,Really Lousy Display,"Wow -- I'm glad I looked at this in the store before buying. The display is so dim that I couldn't even see the colors -- for a few minutes, I thought I was looking at the monochrome version. You can't adjust this, either. It's truly hard on the eyes. I see no reason to pay extra money for this over the Palm Vx, unless you need the extra memory slot."
1,It's a good thing they are replacing it.,"I owned one for a day. The touch screen kept getting false readings until I had to reset. The display at the store seemed to have the same problem. The cradle makes an loud crack when you remove it and as we all know the color screen isn't that impressive to begin with.My wife's Palm Vx is a high quality device. The M505 I purchased is not. I don't know if it a quality control issue or poor design, but this is not a product I would recomend for anyone."
2,Terrible color screen,This screen with the 505 is absolutly terrible. I can not look past the grid lines to even see the pixels. I get dizzy. Stay with the monochrome and you will not regret it. I am returning mine tomorrow for a Vx!The pictures on this web site does not show how bad the screen is.
3,Terrible Color Screen,"I upgraded to the M505 from the V and I could not wait to get the color screen. It is horrible. The Amazon review is right on the money. You cannot see what is on the screen in the normal lighting in your office. I am going to return it and stick the the V or get the M500 which is monochrome. If you want to buy this product, I would suggest that you go to a store and turn one on so that you know what a poor screen it has before you buy. I did not do this and instead bought it online sight unseen. Big mistake. Big disappointment. Beware."
3,"Slow video playback, access to SD card and poor screen","I've had my palm M505 for nearly a year now. A few things to keep in mind if you decide to buy one. Video playback from an SD card is slow. It's even slower if you use an MMC card. Second, if you have a few dozen photos on a 16MB SD card and you access the pictures you'll need to wait 15 seconds before it lists all your photo files. The brightness of the screen is a disappointment, too. If I had my time over again I would have bought one of the Pocket PCs. However, there's lots of great software for the palm and this model is so seductively sleek and stylish."
2,Not worth it.,"If you're a person who needs a PDA to keep your schedules, notes, do calculations, etc... This unit is not for you. All you have to do is get the cheapest PDA, I recommend PALM for your simple needs, and use it. Also, for color PDAs, I suggest gettin a Pocket PC, possibly a Philips, Compaq, or HP brand."
4,Good but...,"Overall quite a nice little gadget. More stable and faster than my previous Visor Deluxe. Yes the colours are nice/vivid but you have to have the backlight on because it is not that bright. One of my biggest problems with it is the fact the buttons (4 of them below the screen) are not recessed which means that when in your pocket, and when the cover is pushed, it activates the Palm. Not only does it make the iritating ""beep"" sound but also keeps it on for a while. Do it a few times and it'll drain the batteries. A few flaws but overall not too bad!"
5,Works fine for me,"What's the big deal about the color? I don't see any problems with this handheld at all. I also have a Handspring Visor Deluxe and when you look from one to the other, the Visor display is green and faded and makes me sick now. The white background and crisp coloring and contrast really work for me.I've had my m505 for a month now and have no complaints about it. The price is kinda steep and may be a big investment for newbies that aren't sure what they want to do....Although I love my m505, I am still kinda kicking myself for not being patient enough for the new Sony Clie (supports mp3 playback and memory sticks)."
3,Ok . . . But,"I never thought I'd use the PALM III when I first got it. It wasn't until I began inputting directly from the computer and hot synching that I began to grow in love and then use the darn thing continually.When the 505 first came out, I got it for: the color screen; the option to add more memory (I told you I use it a lot); and, the rechargable battery.The color screen is the opening one. Come on PALM, you couldn't provide us with color on the date book or the calendar? Adding the memory card is almost too easy and it works. Adding an e-book or a memory hog like Vindigo which has to weekly update is now a non-issue. There is plenty of room for add-ons and expansions.But PALM has made no attempt to resolve issues like back lighting and the difficult writing method PALM is suppose to use.So, if you use your PALM for everything and don't mind the limited color programs, this PALM is for you."
5,Seems good to me,"I dont understand the reviewers complaints about the screen. I find it to be perfectly acceptable. The contrast and lighting is less intense than say the IIIC or the IPAQ, but that is a GOOD THING. THe IIIC's colors for example have a terrible tendancy to 'drip', making it a very messy screen in general. The IPAQ screen is beautiful because of its higher resolution, but i found that in both cases i had a headache after about 30mins use : these screens were much too bright. At least with the 505 i could switch off the backlight and in normal lighting condition could fool around endlessly without going into furiously heavy blinking mode after 20mins use. The rest is standard Palm : synchronising is perfect, AvantGo is brilliant for those of us wanting web content on the go, and the expansion slot is a bonus. Add the fact that you can upgrade the OS, and its the smallest color PDA on the market, makes it for me the clear winner !"
2,Try a Visor Prism Instead,I too have been a long-time Palm user and currently own a IIIc and VIIx. I have been looking for a 65k color screen and waited to see the 505 - I was really disappointed - I agree with most of the negative reviews here - the screen is miserable. I have opted to purchase a Visor Prism instead - plus the Springboard slot in the Visor is much more robust than the Palm card slot.
2,What's with that screen??,"I must say that I'm VERY dissapointed with the m505. I've onwed Palm III and Palm Vx before, and never thought that I will be switching, however when it came time to upgrade (just last week,)I had a chance to compare the Sony Clie 610C ... and the m505 side-by-side. This should be recommended to everybody before they purchase the m505, because the Sony screen is SO MUCH BETTER. It is actually bright, you can see colors clearly, it is great outdoors, and has 320x320 resolution as oposed to m505's standard 160x160. The detail, sharpness and brightness of the Sony are simply in a different category.To sum it up, shame on you Palm for selling the MOST ... Palm OS based PDA that has such a poor screen."
2,dissapointed,"Review of Palm 505,I've owned the Palm IIIXe and was satisfied until it died after 3 years. I then decided to upgrade to the Palm 505, because of the expansion card and the color. I loved it!!!! and used it everyday at home and work. I consider the Palm instrumental, but on Jan 1,2002 my Palm 505 crashed, I lost all data including Epocrates, Id, Pt files, Photo software, Printing software, Patientkeeper data files and all appointments and my work schedules. To make matters worse I was also unable to synchronize with the desktop and have not been able to do so since 01/01/02.I'm still trying to contact Palm without success. As of today, I will switch to Handspring Prism. By the way ,several of my colleagues have the same issues with the Palm 505, we thought it was a virus. Many have switched to the HP Jornada."
1,m505 has disappointing subjective image quality,"The Palm m505 has a dull looking screen, with subjectively low contrast. Black text appears painted on a gray background, instead of on a crisp white background. I don't care if the Palm m505 is a technological marvel inside the case, when the image on the screen is so poor, subjectively.Palm should hire some experts in human visual perception and image quality, and release a product with a better screen."
2,Hardware problems,"I have owned by Palm m505 for four months and I have had to send the cradle in twice for replacement. It has become a real problem for me because I use it for everything and I have to send in both my palm and the cradle to the factory and I have to live without it for at least a week. I love my palm, but if I had to do it over again, I would have waited for the 515. The color on the 505 is not all that great and I almost always have to turn the backlight on. The ease of use is great, but the hardware problems are extremely frustrating."
1,Palm m505 may sink the Palm line,"I was so excited about the new color Palm that I just couldn't bear the wait. I ran out and got one as soon as it came out. What a colossal disappointment. I couldn't tell the color screen from previous monochrome screens. The m505 has the dullest, hardest to read screen ever(in ANY light). Who is responsible for this travesty? I'm sure he/she works for Handspring and wants to drive Palm out of business. I have loved my Palm IIIc from day one and had high hopes of the m505 surpassing it in brilliance and clarity. I think I'll stick with my IIIc and hope that the near future will bring a new VASTLY improved color screen for the m505. Palm needs to seriously re-think the m505."
2,What a Huge Disappointment,"I was waiting to spend an Amazon gift certificate towards a new Palm. My old PDA died months ago and I dropped to paper for a few months anticipating the new speedy, colorful,lots of memory Palm. I struggled with the screen on the old monochrome. So Color was the only way for me. UGH!!! Even with the backlight on it's barely acceptable. Palm has pulled a hoax on the public. The picture of the Palm 505 in their brochures is far brighter than the actual Palm. If it matters that you can see the screen, don't buy this one.Oct. 2003... I can't believe Amazon lets you edit your reviews. I finally ditched the 505 for a new Tungsten C. Palm finally got this one right. It colorful, bright, fast, lots of memory and with the wireless router in my house I can sit at the kitchen table and drink my coffee and read my e-mail before leaving the house."
3,Not Really Color!,"The Palm m505 is not all I expected. Yes, it is a step forward but the color features are not that good. For the basic Palm functions that we all know, very little of it is in color. So little in fact that I call Palm tech support to confirm mine was not defective. The rest of it is ""a bit better to have""."
5,My favorite Palm yet!,"The is my third Palm. First I used the Palm Vx. I liked it because of its small size. I then went to the Palm IIIc for the color. The new Palm M505 combines the best of both. Granted, the screen could be a bit brigher, but I have found it very comfortable to view in almost every setting. Unlike the IIIc, you can actually use it in direct sunlight. That's a big help to me because I use it in my car a lot. The expansion slot is also a big improvement. I hightly recommend this Palm."
2,The color could be better . . .,"The screen gives me a headache--literally. The color is okay with the backlight on but it drains on the battery. Other than that, it is a good gadget. Still, I'm probably not going to keep mine."
2,DO NOT BUY THE m505,"I'll make this short: The monitor is so bad that you can't read it in normal office lighting without holding it at an angle. Unforgiveable for Palm to put out a product like this. It looks good and it has fast performance, but you can't read the display.Neither can you see the colors. Terrible. Whoever designed this display for Palm should be bend over the president's knee and paddled. This device is Amateur at best. I am actually embarrased to show it to people becaue they always tell me that they can't read it. One guy actually laughed at me when he looked at the display and after I told him what I paid for it.DO NOT BUY."
4,so so cool except for one thing the color,"the M 505 is awsome!! I have one and it is fast you dont have to wait for it to to load or anything like that. i take it to school every day to write notes in and do my home work.it has lots of memory and it has no problem storing all my tons of information and games. the one problem that kept me from giving it 5 stars was that the color is not really bright like other palms pilots. the screen is colorful i mean this palm has 65,000 colors but they arent that bright. Even when you turn on the light it gets brighter but it drains the battery fast. despite the not very bright color on the screen I highly suggest buying this palm!! i love it!!"
1,Known defect,"Review of the bulletin boards and the amazon reviews reveals that product has a known defect with the cradle. Like some of the other reviewers, my cradled worked fine for a few days, then just quit. Customer support is virtually impossible to obtain and Palm's web-site makes no mention of this known defect. After 45 minutes on hold, on a long-distance call, I finally talked to a customer support rep who admitted there was a problem and offered to send a ""refurbished"" cradle. Unacceptable,--I paid for a new one and they want to give me a used one. There are many web-sites which discuss this flaw, ..."
1,"DO NOT BUY IT, buy a CLIE instead","The internal device that locks the expansion card is very sensitive, if by any reason you push the card beyond what it was designed for (Who calculated that force was maybe a little 2 years old kid), you can brake it and therefore you will not be able to insert it back (it will not lock)..."
2,"Great for a year, then no Hotsync Twice!!!","My boss and I both bought 505s at the same time. After one year mine would not hotsync. After several days working with support, I was told it must have taken a static electricity charge and will not work. It was just out of warranty. Palm offered me 20% off of a new PDA. Two weeks later the same thing happened to my boss. After investigating we learned this is a known problem and happens frequently. It was a great tool while it lasted. Without hotsync, it is worthless to me."
3,MENOS DE LO ESPERADO CON LA NUEVA PALM M505,"Tenia una Palm Vx, la cambie por el nuevo modelo PALM m505 esperando encontrarme con una agenda mucho mejor, pero no fue asi, este modelo a pesar de ser a color no es atractivo a la vista, no ofrece nada nuevo ni mejoras sustanciales a lo que ya se tenia en la Vx. Ademas de que muchos de los programas ya existentes para la Palm Vx no funcionan correctamente o no son compatibles con esta Palm M505. Despues de esta decepcion mejor me cambie a las Pocket Pc (IPAQ). En mi experiencia personal si ya tienes una Palm Vx, no vale la pena la inversion en este nuevo modelo de Palm, yo preferiria conservar mi Palm Vx. Mucho dinero por pocos cambios.Antonio."
3,My ebook experience,"This is my first ebook, and it may be the last for a while. I was able to download the ebook from Amazon without trouble, but I was not able to transfer the ebook from one computer to another, because I couldn't get my Adobe Reader 6.0 activated. Unfortunately, I used my desktop computer to download the ebook, because it is connected to DSL. What I want is to have the ebook on my laptop (not connected to DSL, though), so I can read the ebook at work. The good news is that this ebook didn't cost very much. I also don't think this is Amazon's problem, but they happen to be the messenger.So far I have read one page of the book, which is not neither good nor bad (meaning 2.5 stars). One of these days I'll get a hold of a hard copy and read the entire book."
4,A WINNER ALL THE WAY,"Don't trust Leonard Maltin on that one and look at the movie with friendly eyes.We have a very nice screenplay by MELVILLE SHAVELSON one of the many talented Bob Hope boys), later a film director, from a story by Leo RostenThe RKO cinematography by Robert de Grasse is superior grade. The songs by Sammy Cahn and Jule Styne are very good.We had heard Groucho Marx sing: he can sing with Sinatra too, his acting is really good, very subtle. Sinatra shows how he became a great actor.Jane Russell was a good actress, a very intelligent woman and a superb looking woman, unless the blonde somebody. In fact, all the acting is pretty good.The film is very funny, did I forget to say it?I may have become soft in the head in my old age, but the owner of the bank surely is ROBERT BENCHLEY (uncredited). All my files which I kept by hand are out of reach, may the gods of the french movie buffs spare me if I am wrong."
3,Single Dynamite,"Best for Sinatra singing from his bed and for Groucho doing his thing. Otherwise, strictly B movie material. If you LOVE Sintra, it's always worth a look."
3,fun early Sinatra vehicle,"I wasn't expecting to like DOUBLE DYNAMITE as much as I did. This is a really fun little movie! Frank Sinatra (at the height of his early RKO days) stars as bank clerk Johnny Dalton, whose pending marriage to fellow employee Mildred ""Mibs"" Goodhue (Jane Russell) is threatened because he cannot secure a pay rise.Enter a shady gangster, whom Johnny saves from some thugs. He gives Johnny $1000, which quickly appreciates when the money is used to bet on a few winning horses. Now Johnny has the money to marry ""Mibs"", but the bank managers believe it's been stolen from missing funds!Sure it's not the most sophisticated movie you'll ever see, but it does boast the hilarious Groucho Marx as a wisecracking restaurant waiter who takes Johnny under-wing; not to mention the chart-topping duet ""Kisses and Tears"" for Sinatra and Russell. It's a refreshing change seeing Ms Russell play against her brassy bombshell stereotype, and young Sinatra is always a pleasure. Recommended."
4,A fairly good flick,"I didn,t order this movie. My wife did because she knew Jayne Russell. But I found a pretty good vehicle for Groucho Marx fans for which I am. All the great one liners and fast wit I,ve grown up with. OH YEAH, Sinatra was ok. And get this, Russell played against type.She was rather dull. Overall it wasn,t bad."
4,King and I still a classic,I bought it because our Theater Group is doing this Musical this summer. It had been any years since I had last seen it. With all of the new technology that has come along it's just amazing how wonderful it looks.
3,"amusing, and all fiction","This movie, and the book it came from, will never be shown in Thailand, as it is very much at variance with how the Thais recall things. OK, this is charming, it's just not real. The author, Anna, was a tutor in Thailand, but seems to have fantasized a good part of her story. Good Hollywood fare, and of course Hollywoodized into fiction."
5,Great,"This was a gift. The anniversary edition was a great upgrade from the standard DVD. Not a lot more money, either."
5,Yul Brenner's Best Role,"In my opinion the role of The King in ""The King and I"" was best played by Yul Brenner. Debra Kerr was an excellant choice for the counter-part of Anna. Together they gave the movie class and enchantment. I have loved this movie since my childhood days, and had to add the aniversary issue to my collection."
5,Classic musical film,Film and music buffs will enjoy this classic musical with Brenner. The digital quality of the CD made this sit at home film experience the best.
3,"Brilliant, Excellent, etc., etc.","For me it's a little boring as it drags on at times, but love the singing and dancing. Rita Moreno is excellent."
5,Enduring classic,"It was wonderful when I watched it as a child, it's is wonderful to come back to it with my daughter!"
5,good times,"Classic film that allows new generations, as my children, appreciate the film classic and amazing actors missing and they could not know"
2,"Not ""Something Wonderful"" This Time Around","Yul Brynner's performance in ""The King And I"" must stand out as one of a handful of truly memorable film performances. Rodgers and Hammerstein's sweeping musical/drama has been the subject of much critical debate. The Siamese continue to feel that both the play and the film present their monarch as a simple thug converted by colonialism as represented, at least here, by the stunning person of Deborah Kerr. As a musical this is definitely one of the all time greats. It's just such a shame that Fox, the company responsible for this DVD, hasn't realized this. The non-anamorphic DVD is loaded with digital imperfections, aliasing, shimmering, grain and dirt that make for a pretty dismal visual presentation. Also, extras are zero, not even a featurette or interviews. What a disappointment. This is definitely a title that needs to be revisited and soon."
5,I loved it.,"Though this story is almost completly fictional (just BASED on facts, as many stories are), it is so beautiful. What captured me most about the movie (other than the music) was the romance. I mean, they managed to have an intimate relationship without much personal contact. That dance after the dinner, (with my favorite song from this musical, Shall We Dance) left me almost breathless. As someone said to me, it's hard to create a romance with no kissing and sex but Rodgers and Hammerstein did it. And did it well. Buy this movie today!"
5,SENSATIONAL--ESPECIALLY IN THE WIDESCREEN DVD VERSION,You don't need to read another rave review of one of the greatest movie musicals of all time.I'm not a DVD techie but I have to say that I was blown away by the widescreen version of the movie--which adds manages to add scope of the picture in practically every scene. I saw it 35 years ago on the big screen and have always wondered why repeated videe and TV viewings never seemed as sumptuous--the widescreeen makes a huge difference.
2,BLASTFOMY!!!!!,"Mr.Hammerstein and Mr. Rogers must be turning over in their graves! Fred Astaire always demanded that his movies never showed just his feet. He was so dedicated to the art of dance that he wanted the audience to see the ENTIRE STEP with his entire body flowing. Well, this film gave us just the feet. ""I have dreamed"" is one of my favorite songs. Its a classic Rogers and Hammerstein number. When I got to that part of the movie I told my family to be quiet and turn up the AV system. ""Here it comes"" i said ""This is the most beautiful song in the film""...HA! The joke was on me. It was cut from the DVD along with ""Toads"" and ""should I tell you what i think of you"" This is the problem when uninspired corporate jr. executives are in charge of managing priceless works of art. I wonder how many of the people who decided to cut these musical treasures from the DVD have even heard of Yul Brenner or Deborah Kerr. For the sake of the bottom line we got just the feet. Not the whole body."
3,Disapointing DVD of Outstanding Musical,"The King and I is a great musical. Unfortunately, this DVD does not include a number of the songs (see other reviews) that made The King and I such a great musical. In addition, it is in cinamascope wide screen, which even on a 16:9 ratio TV gives a relatively small picture (it fills only about half of the screen).Were it not for these two faults, I would have rated it 5 stars, since everyone sang and acted very well, and the scenery & costumes were excellent."
3,Would Have Been Great with All the Music,"As rolnel2 pointed out in his review of this DVD, two musical numbers, which are especially important to the story, were left out of the DVD version of this glorious musical: ""Shall I Tell You What I Think of You"" (with Anna combing her hair while mimicing the royal court and the King catching her in the act) and ""My Lord and Master"" (which explains Tuptim's unhappiness, not just because she's in love with Lum Tha, but because of her place in Siamese society). They were in the original movie release and are in the soundtrack. It's unfortunate that they were cut for later viewings. Their inclusion, and a better widescreen showing, would have made this 5 stars instead of 3."
1,where's the pivotal scene?,"If this is the same video that came on the market about 2.5 years ago, it is missing the scene in which Anna tells the King off in a soliloquy (first line: ""Shall I tell you what I think of you? You're spoiled!"") Since that scene focuses the show's central conflict, eliminating it eviscerates the film. (If there's a different edition from the one I describe, please make it known!)"
5,a classic,A true musical theater classic. Wonderful melodies that will last for years to come.Other classics not to forget about are:Mary PoppinsMy Fair LadyThe Wizard of OzChitty Chitty Bang BandThe first Charlie and the Chocolate FactoryThe Sound of MusicOliverWest Side StoryFiddler on the RoofSinging in the RainThe WizLittle MermaidAladdinBeauty and the BeastGreaseThe King and IOklahomaThe Music ManSouth PacificMy Voice Students are always asking me for recommendations so I though I'd post it for all! We can't forget about these great musicals!
1,insulting to Thai monarchy,"I live in Siam. Have seen this movie in US theatres.It is banned in Siam as being insulting to King Mongkut(The king Rama IV). Historically inaccuate, It portrays Anna as having an influence on the king which is simply not true! She was nothing more than a tutor for Mongkut's son(Chulalongkorn Rama V) who succeeded his father as King and is generally regarded here as a combination George Washingon, Abraham Lincoln. Anna upon leaving the Royal Court here exagerated her importance for self agrandizment Also the movies portrayal of the Kings devotions to Lord Buddha is insulting to Buddhism. In Thailand all the kings are highly regarded and can easily earn jail time for Less majesty for anything derogatory about the monarchy or Buddhism. I've ordered it to show my Thai friends for their oppinion. Hopping it will make it through customs.I guess historical accuracy is not important as long as it sells tickets!!"
5,Something Wonderful!,"KON-NICHI-WA! ""Shall we dance?"" is one the most famous musical number in Japan. I love this movie, and Yul Brynner as the King of Siam, very much. YES! This movie is the miracle. The King, Anna, and the children are so wonderful forever!"
1,Very disappointed,"When I purchased this video I was expecting to see the movie. Instead I got a review of the movie, interviews with the actors, and the like. No where did I see when I ordered this movie, anything to the fact that this video was NOT a movie. I think I got ripped off. Don't think I'll be buying anymore movies on Amazon."
3,Great play,"I loved the play and this movie, but the DVD version will not enhance your enjoyment of this classic much. Buy the movie, but stick with cheapest format. Yul was born to play the King."
2,What happened to the color?,"I just bought the DVD, after reading all the glorious reviews on this web site. I was very disappointed in the color. Specifically, my copy had a large purple discoloration of the film image about a quarter in from the right screen margin. It was there for at least 3/4 of the movie and was quite distracting. Has any other viewer seen this? Could it be a defective disc?"
3,Love the story,Picture was blury on full screen and sound was low. Made it hard to watch and hear. Don't know what else to say.
5,The King and I (50th Anniversary Edition),"I bought this as a gift for my mother and she loved it. When I received it in the mail, I checked it over and noted that there was no damage and the DVD was not lose in the case. I was well pleased with the condition and how quickly I got it after ordering it."
5,The King and I,Awesome! This was my first time seeing this show and I was totally impressed. Deborah Kerr was phenomenal as I knew she would be. Yul Brynner was fantastic as well! I recommend this for any age.
4,A great Musical,"The King and I is one of Rogers and Hammerstein's greatest musicals. It is the musical version of ""Anna and the King"". The cinematography and scenery greatly captures the beauty and mystery of 19th century Siam. The story centers around the story of Anna Leowens who is hired to be the governess to the Kings adorable children. There is abattle of wills right from the begining between Anna and the King. Anna begins to fall in love with the children. She expresses this love with the song ""Getting to know you"". Anna brings in her Western Ideals and begins to have an effect on the king. One dramatic scene is when he tries to whip a runaway slave girl (Tuptim). Because of Anna's influence he can not do it. One of the best scenes is when Anna teaches the King to dance. This has to be the greatest dance sequence ever recorded on film (even better than Fred Astair and Ginger Rogers in ""Top Hat"")."
5,CLASSIC HOLLYWOOD!!!,"I WATCHED THIS FILM, WHEN I WAS A TEENAGER, SO I WANTED TO BUY IT SINCE LONG AGO, THE PRODUCT IS EXCELLENT, PERFECT CONDITIONS, I'M SO HAPPY TO HAVE IT. THE PERFORMANCES ARE AMAZING, AND YUL BRYNNER IS UNFORGETALBLE LIKE ALWAYS, DEBORAH KERR IS SO TENDER AND LOVELY! IT'S A CLASSIC YOU'LL LOVE!!"
2,A big disappointment,"I've felt for many years that this was the best of Rogers and Hammerstein's musicals and the original film was nothing short of magnificent. But the DVD is a terrible disappointment. The video is fine, but the sound is sorry indeed. (Perhaps they weren't able to recover the original tracks). But the real tragedy is the loss of two of the show's beautiful songs: ""My Lord and Master"" and ""I Have Dreamed."" The original film was very long by today's standards, but leaving out these two numbers left a big hole for me. Darn!"
3,"Well done, but very little new information","As someone who has taught A Chorus Line and read several books or accounts about it's inception, this DVD was quite disappointing. They relied heavily on telling the story of the inception of the original A Chorus Line, which I would argue is fairly well known (at least through theatre circles anyway). Several people I know saw it in the theatres and said it was SO great, truly one of the best documentaries of the year, yet I thought it _dragged_. They left out how several key characters were cast (Morales anyone?) and there were no extras on the DVD that examined the middling success of this revival or updates from the cast of the current or previous incarnations. It was fun to see Tyce Diorio, now famous for his ""cancer dance"" on SYTYCD to be so blantantly egocentric to the point where he lost the part, but that was about the only thing I found exciting."
5,I will watch more than once!,"From 1980 - 1985 I lived close to New York and saw ""Chorus Line"" on Broadway 5 or 6 times. My all time favorite Broadway musical. The movie was horrible, and there is no DVD available of the show as it appeared on stage. This DVD is the next best thing as it takes you through auditions for a revival, and refers back to the process of getting the first show produced. I would recommend this for anyone who loves ""Chorus Line"" and even for those who have not seen the play on stage, but love Broadway musicals."
5,Incredible. A must have for any Broadway fan!,Stellar! Incredible and rare look inside the process of selecting a Broadway cast of an iconic show. Fascinating & riveting! You will watch this again & again. Great extras & incredible commentary! Do yourself a favor and run do not walk to buy this for yourself.
5,Don't miss disc 2!,"It is rare for the supplemental disc to be just as good as the primary, but the commentary and interviews add even more insight and joy to the movie itself. And there is more about auditioners who didn't make the cut. The movie was a brilliant idea and the second disk only builds on it. The musical and this movie capture so well what we felt when we first came to New York to start our careers. The original, the revival and now this movie--all fresh and captivating: only few classics can make that claim. And Every Little Step surely is rewarding to those who missed Chorus Line on stage.Nikki and Barry"
5,This is one of the most useful books I have read recently,"In fact, I purchased several copies as gifts. The online assessment is worth the price of this book. As a business coach, I have tremendous appreciation for the breadth of his Gallup-based research. When we focus on our strengths we become better. I strongly recommend this book for anyone interested in developing their career. I should add that his points about selecting a sales career that matches strengths with relationship with your manager is congruent with my experiePassionate Action: 5 Steps to Extraordinary Success in Life and Worknce. I have 2 family members who are sales managers. And I work with many salespeople who struggle with career satisfaction. Hence, I srongle endorse this book. Doug Gray, PCC, and author of"
5,Extremely helpful,"It is a book about increasing performances. The authors were right when they wrote "" Strenghts are based on talent,and great performances comes from strenghts."" By doing more of what you do best, you will increase your performance. A must read book."
4,Excellent Sales Skills Resource!,"Excellent material! (I do like the original, ""Now, Discover your strengths"", better as a book. I think the original is more smoothly written, but sales people like to read sales examples.)We are using this book with our(pharma)sales reps and also with the corporate personel they work with. This book and the strengthsfinder assessment helps sales people identify their strengths and really focus on them. I have moved to this model in my sales skills training as well as in our performance management model and coaching sessions."
3,Great Book for Sales Managers,"This book is great for those who have not read Now, Discover Your Strengths. There are some great statistics and ideas for sales managers, however, not too great for sales personnel. I would have liked to have seen more of a sales oriented spin on the interpretation strengthfinder assessment. It was the same interpretation as the assessment for Now, Discover Your Strengths."
5,It's noodles!,As someone milk allergic it's insanely difficult to find ramen that has no milk-based ingredients and that is not made on equipment shared with dairy. Tradition's products are not made to cater to the allergic but being Kosher parve means they're suitable. Since they're parve they should also be fine for vegans although I haven't looked into it.They have a taste almost identical to your standard beef cup noodle. The vegetables rehydrate nicely and the noodles don't swell up hideously if you let it sit for longer than directed. I was quite pleased since these were the first ramen I've been able to eat in about three years.
3,Not too impressed,"I picked this up as a sample of Jean-Jacques Goldberg's early work. The allmusic entry for Tai Phong lead me to expect French-Vietnamese prog rock. I don't really hear that at all. It ends up being rather generic-sounding 70s rock, and most disappointingly of all, it's all sung in English. I had hoped something in French and/or Vietnamese to at least offer the exotic aspect of the language."
1,this cd causes anxiety,"This cd had the potential to be awesome.Instead, it's filled with anxious and obnoxious rythms.All the songs sound too similar.Don't get me wrong, Osburn has great talent, but he didn't use any of it writing this album.Seriously, this cd causes anxiety."
3,Holiday Music,"Maybe it's not the best solo album from the Pink Floyd crew, but it's quite relaxing as background music. Or just to chill out on your sofa. It's well played and produced. It's a pity it's out of print as it's not worth the prices it gets on the used-market!"
3,Worth buying,"If you want to complete your collection of solo albums of Pink Floyd members, it is worth it. The music doesn't set the world on fire but it is easy on the ears."
3,This album is another tasty treat to listen to.,I like this album alot. I would've liked it more if Rick would have sang in more of the songs. He has a really lovely english accent and it would be a beneficiary if he would use it more on this album.
3,Richard Wright - 'Wet Dream' (One Way Records),"Review no. 43. Recorded in 1978, however didn't get a proper release until 1994 on One Way Records. This was his first out of two solo records. Tracks that I thought showed some promise were ""Against The Odds"", the soothing jazz-like ""Cat Cruise"", ""Mad Yannis Dance"" and another jazz-like tune ""Waves"" {jazzy but, still good]. Much like his 'Broken China' title (see my review), this piece is okay and all - simply not exactly what I had maybe expected. Line-up: Richard Wright - keyboards, synthesizer & vocals, Snowy White (Thin Lizzy) - guitar, Larry Steele (.38 Special) - bass, Mel Collins (King Crimson) - saxaphone & flute and Reg Isadore (Robin Trower - I thought I recognized the name) - drums."
1,Give me a break,"This is the worst album I have ever heard in my entire life, I feel like the time I spent listening to this was wasted"
3,Really Don't Know,"With all the positive reviews, it surprising this was never re-released perhaps David Gilmour will think of doing what he did for his friend as he did with Syd."
2,Not worth it. A waste of my time and money,"Carol Queen is obsessed with sex much more than she should be, and I don't say this as a fundamental fanatic. I grew up in NYC and find Queen's analysis of sex and sexual preferences goes far beyond the need to classify a person's feelings toward sex. I skipped roughly 70% of the book's chapters to avoid the author's incessant ramblings. Reading the book made me feel I was sitting through a horrible, post-feminist unending lecture, in which Queen makes lame attempts to identify every single sexual preference under the sun, while poorly and boringly validating every sex industry career move she has ever made.Chronicles of a Sex-Positive Culture only goes to prove how some people try to dismantle the mystical erotic pleasure derived from every exciting form of sex."
5,Hot new pop group goes to town!,"I had an enjoyable time watching and listening to The Corrs in concert. I was first attracted to the group from listening to the Quest for Camelot soundtrack, which featured Andrea Corr as the singing voice of Kayley. Her style of innocence with emotion caught my attention. The DVD is a great way to get the feel of the concert without actually being there. The 5.1 channel definition is great. The DVD concert features all the songs from the first 2 CDs...one right after another with little break in between songs...just enough to introduce the title of the song! The Corrs are a talented group of family musicians/singers...It has been a while since I have remembered a similar group.Enjoy!"
5,"Attractive & Talented, don't you just hate people like that?","I'm a big fan of the Corrs, so obviously my opinion is going to be slanted their way quite a bit. This DVD is proof that the Corrs are just as good live on stage as they are in the studio. I just wish they'd hurry up and make a DVD of their ""Unplugged"" appearance."
4,Corrs,"Corrs is the first band that I fell in love with. 'Royal Albert Hall' is a very good video to relax and entertain yourself after office burn-out. If you are energetic and want more powerful dose, you might try 'The Best of Corrs'. If you want to delve into their past, you might try 'Way Back Home'."
4,Royal Albert Hall,"There are very few performers who enhance the Royal Albert Hall venue. While the Corrs are wonderful, it was the Royal Albert Hall that made them worthy of the venue."
5,Live Show,"This is a great show. I have it on video, sound and picture quality are fantastic. I have been to 3 live concerts in Australia and this video brings back alot of memories. This is a MUST HAVE for any Corrs fan."
5,5 of 5,The book was on time and my wife enjoyes it.The price was fair and the packaging also the right size and protection.
5,A must have for all trumpet fans,"What else can really be said about the group Chase ? I was a big MF fan (and still am) but when I heard Open Up Wide, I was hooked, Chase and everything he every recording he ever played on became a big part of my life. This album is a classic."
5,Trumpet Screaming at its Finest!,"My H.S. Band Director introduced me to this CD when I was a freshman, and since then I've collected all three CD's. No one plays higher and with more control than Bill Chase!!! Who knows where jazz trumpet would be if he were still here today."
5,Jazz Rock at its best - Outstanding!!,Chase was one of a kind as a group. Each individual knew their instrument and blended incredibly well. I've never forgotten attending a jazz clinic the band put on in the early 70's. Dart Brown was an incredible bassist and led me to buy my Gibson Ripper Bass....one I still have. Get It On has always been a favorite to just listen to the trumpet harmonies on the musical rifs. I only wish I still had my quadraphonic 8thrack of this one!
5,Bill Chase,"Sadly enough very few people have heard of Bill Chase. But he is one of my favorite trumpet players of all time. Being a trumpet player myself I liked him from the begining when my dad first pulled out the viynal and put it on and said listen to this. Ever scince i was hooked on him. Just the first song on the album ""Open Up Wide"" sends shivers through my spine. And the classic song ""Get It On"" is so great. I like introducing Chase to some of my fellow trumpet players and non-trumpet players and seeing their reaction to how amazing he is. I don't know anyone yet who doesn't like the album. And all the songs on it are good not just the other two I mentioned. So i would recomend anyone to buy this album and enjoy it. And spread the word on of Bill Chase."
5,Truely unique - just as good in person,I probably love this group because I played trumpet but also because a couple of friends played with the group. I lost one in the plane crash and it was a music industy loss. They sounded as good in person when I heard them in Dallas in the early 70's. TRUE sound - not a lot of gimmicks. Bill could really blow and Wally... you're the still the best. Dennis is the most outrageous basssist. Play on! Wish they were still playing.
5,Ahead of it's time! A sound not yet duplicated to date.,"Bill Chase captured the hottest Jazz Rock of it's time and to date this sound has not been recreated by anyone. His cutting edge chord progressions and innovative, extreme upper-register brass voicing still produce high energy nearly 30 years later. Sadly, there is no current artist that produces this style of music. Record companies would be wise to offer re-releases of the other two Chase albums; Chase/Ennea and Chase/Pure Music. Also of interest to rock and jazz enthusiasts would be any unreleased recordings of the group."
3,Its all the same!,"Yes, Chase can play high and with control, but after the 4th tune with four screeching trumpets, only trumpet players care. The group has talent, but it need some variety - trombone, sax - something to break up the trumpet sound. The recording has OK vocals, good tunes (Hello Groceries is a fav), but overall, 3 stars."
2,Scale not to size,"I received my table a few days ago. It is alright but I think the picture makes it look nicer. I also have found that the legs are very short. The table is not of normal height, so needless to say I am very disappointed. If you are going to purchase this item you need to be aware of the height of the table.Thank you."
2,"not worth the money, legs break easily","I've had this table a couple of years now, as well as the matching chairs. The chairs are okay. But the table is worse than awful. The legs are fastened by an obliquely set screw in the bare wood, and any pressure on the leg, such as moving the table slightly,or even tightening the screw too much, causes the triangle of brittle wood that holds the leg to the table to break off at the screw point, making the leg useless. You can then turn the leg upside down and drill a new hole to hold the leg in place, but eventually you end up going to a lumber store to replace the legs. The table top is very poorly made, with patched wood and filler. It is maybe worth $80. Certainly for $300, you can get something much better."
3,Looks Cool,"This clock looks really cool lit up at night. However, it is pretty hard to read when it is dark in the room."
1,big disappointment,"have all the kings x, ty tabor solo, platypus, poundhound stuff, and have kings x 10+ times. this is by far the biggest disappointment and the money would have been better spent on the new one black like sunday (heard a few new tracks live at their most recent show and the tunes were great!). gave this cd away to a friend who thought it was ok."
4,This is not a masterpiece but...,"it is much better than any of King's X's studio efforts since joining Metal Blade. There are some stellar tracks here. For instance, both 'Flowers' and 'C'Mon' are very catchy pop-hard rock songs that might have seen much airplay if released 20 years ago. This is worth a look if you like both old KX and the Foo Fighters. I disagree with the other reviewer's comparison to Belew and The Bears; Car Caught Fire is much better than this."
4,Love Light Houses,Very educational found a couple things i missed on my last visit ..now i know..Video is short but educational.I will review next trip love the outer banks.
4,Not Jane Austen at her 5 Star Best...but for the devotee... one sees the artist growing....,"This book reminded me of all the things I like about Jane Austen, so I am reading every novel she wrote. Northanger Abbey is weak in ways I don't expect Austen to be weak, but for the person who seeks to watch her art in progress, this is an excellent example of the author learning her way toward her great masterpieces.You consequently will not be as swept off your feet, but you will learn a great deal about Austen's development as a unique and incomparable author in her time and place.I for one am always watching the way she develops her main female protagonist...giving her a mind in a day and age when women were seldom expected to have a mind, much less put it to any good use!I learned from this book...and for me that made the reading of it well worth it."
3,Mildly Enjoyable,"An interesting look at the customs of the day, but not a page-turner. No climax to speak of. Yet I do still love the challenge of reading Austen's works and will continue to do so."
4,Wonderful,This is my favorite of Jane Austen's so far! It was very easy to understand the dialogue and it is the type of book that kept me reading it till I finished non-stop. It has the perfect amount of romance for me!
4,Will not forget Northanger Abbey,I pushed myself to finish this classic and I am glad that I did. The olde english is very interesting. Northanger Abbey gives the reader a chance to sample life in another era.
4,Jane Austen lite but still enjoyable,"This is actually one of Austen's first works, she kept it for fifteen years, polishing it. It is her lightest work but it is still very good, we all need something light once in a while.Our heroine is Catherine, she is a rather silly young girl who has read too many gothic romances. ""The Mysteries of Udolpho"" in particular has turned her silly head. She seems to see a gothic mystery everywhere she looks. Catherine soon learns that the world is not all melodrama and eventually matures and marries a very sensible man. What keeps Catherine likable is her capacity to learn from her mistakes. She is certainly the least mature of Austen's heroines but she is never boring.This is a marvelous book to start with if you want to get into Jane Austen, it does not have as many characters or subplots as her other works and it is very breezy. I enjoyed it and am now reading Udolpho myself. We'll see what happens. ;-)"
3,The (slightly funny)Opposite of A Thriller,"Catherine Morland succesfully captures the image of a bookish and curious teenager. Although sometimes it was embarassing seeing her faults so amplified...sometimes it was funny.The story is shorter the Austen's other works *happy sigh* and the format of writing it like an adventure with a ""heroine"" was entertaining because it was the story of everyday life.So many people have summarized the novel...I just want to add that it was surprisingly relatable considering it was written 200+ yrs ago. An example of this is her parents response to what happens.Her mother's lectures made me chuckle and I was wowed when her mum went to get the essay that would help Catherine deal with her moodiness. Of course it takes a while because of domestic distractions.It was an okay read. I didn't find the story that interesting or the focal charcters that appealing though."
3,KES Evenstar,"The herione is Catherine Morland. This novel talks of her entering society. But then she's invited to a spooky old abbey like in her gothic novels and daydreams, she begins to suspect her friends wrongly and not suspicious enough of her enemies. She eventually sees reality without dark-colored glasses, and realizes that she is not living in a book. And in life, actions come with humiliation."
4,enjoyable and funny,"A 17 year-old girl,Catherine Morland travels to Bath with Mr and Mrs.Allen,the family's neighbours and friends.There she meets some friends,including a man that Catherine will fall in love with,a polite gentleman,Henry Tilney.She is invited by the Tilneys to spend some weeks in Northanger Abbey,where Catherine ,influenced by the reading of The Misteries of Udolfo and naive as she is,starts to have the most absurdings ideas about the place and about Henry's father!!This is a very funny,enjoyable book.It's ironic and satirical in a delightful way."
5,A different Jane Austin,"I am a Jane Austin fan so I am reading all her books this year I was surprised at how different Northanger is. But i absolutely loved it. Catherine is a great heroine the story is magical. I found it a lot easier of a read. Sometimes the old english writing of the Jane Austin books makes me have to concentrate harder, but this was written in a style easier to read. It's a page turner. You won't want to put it down. For those who love Jane Austin and love her take on the gothic novels of her time enjoy!!"
3,read it because I love the movie,"So I wanted to read this book because I love the movie so much, and I wanted to read all the Jane Austen books. But I found that the movie was more dramatic than the book...well of course it had to be or else it wouldnt have done well. I did like the book, but it was like pulling my hair out to get through it. I like Jane Austen, but I feel like her books are too wordy. I felt that it was true for Northanger Abbey too."
2,Northanger Abbey,Not the best book from Austen. Still fun to read though. Like the description of English country side and life
2,just not good,"Many of the references Austen made in Northanger Abbey were meant to be satirical towards the gothic writing style prevalent in her time. Certain elements of wordplay in her characters' dialogue will also sound dated to a modern reader. For example, Catherine describes a popular gothic novel as being ""Horrible"", which can be taken as ""Awful"" or that the book was scary, which is a way the word was used in the author's time.Having said this, the book is slow, and is not as easy and interesting to read as her other novels, which can be explained by saying that this is her first attempt, and improvement was inevitable. The characters were not well-developed; I didn't understand the love-interest and I didn't believe that these two people were suited for each other. Again, she improved later.If you choose to read this book, try to get an edition with notes on the text.It will help a great deal in clarifying that which is now a centuries-old inside joke."
3,"Northanger Abbey is not great, but good","It isn't a wonderful book, it isn't a great book, but it's a pretty good book and a nice read.Catherine Morland is a great character, and the plot is light hearted and fun. Some of the scenes are really funny, and it's a good light read.On the other hand, the whole thing has had an air of ""rich people without problems amusing themselves"", which is annoying, and parts of the book are dry. If you want a good book to waste away an afternoon, choose this. If you want a great classic, go elsewhere."
1,Audio Kindle Book,The voices on the book are hard on the hear speaking with no feeling or expression. Are there other voices you can chose from.Shona
4,Enjoyable ... for a first novel,"When Jane Austen sold her first book to her first publisher. He locked it up and did not intend to ever publish it. This was probably because it was entertaining but still the work of an amateur. Worth a read and not only because it can help you understand the growth of Jane Austen as an authoress.Catherine Morland, an unlikely heroine as Jane states herself,is invited to go to Bath with her neighbors. Where she learns what society is all about and the difference between reality and imagination."
4,A good read,"Although not one of Jane Austen's more well-read novels, I found this one enjoyable to read. I thought it was a little darker than some of her other novels. Formatting needs some help, but what do you expect when the book is free? Otherwise, a good read."
4,Not What I Expected,"This was my first Jane Austen novel, very much against the recommendation of others. The novel does not paint detailed pictures, but the cleverness of Austen's wit is worth the read in itself. I was disturbed in a one place where Austen broke the continuity of the story for a personal rant, but overall the subtly and intricacy of the plot was much more than I expected, and in the later half of the book I was particularly on edge.I also think that this would be a good book for young people trying to understand relationships. Austen very powerfully demonstrates the underlying manipulation and frivolity that so often accompanies young men and women."
2,Jane Austin didn't deliver,"Jane Austin struck out. I love Emma, Pride and Prejedice, etc. but gave up on this one because I felt as if I were reading some vapid little teenager's tweet."
3,Northanger Anney,Wish she could've written more.The language of that era is charming. Why do I have to write more. moreWords
4,A good selection,"After being disappointed with a couple of Austen's books after P&P;, I was glad to enjoy this one. Her wit is rarely as good as she accomplishes here. The characters are back, too and here we have both a decent leading man and lady.As a work of satire and literary criticism, the story works. Although I am not familiar with the genre she criticizes (past Frankenstein), it lampoons the fans as much as the genre and there are many parallels in today's genre fans.I put ""The Mysteries of Udolpho"" on my list to round out my opinion, but it is huge and I won't be getting at it any time soon."
4,MUCH better than anticipated,"Knowing this was one of the first of Jane Austin's works, I was a bit wary when I began to read it. It was thoroughly enjoyable.Catherine Moreland's imagination is in full swing. Much is harmless and no more than a young girl enjoying herself. An imagination out of control gets her in to a bit of trouble. In the end, all's well that ends well.... well worth the read!In fact, a few weeks after I read it, I was pleasantly suprised to find it showing on Masterpiece Theater! After seeing it on the screen, it made me want to read the book all over again!(P.S. Making an attempt at Mansfield Park, and I must say Northanger Abby is MUCH, MUCH better!)"
3,Nothing to shout about,Much ado about nothing. Poor girl at the mercy of rich people and the main character seemed to be very weak. I guess she was just young.
4,Thoughts,It would have been five stars had I not gotten so annoyed by Catherine's naivety an overactive imagination. Twas funny and well written and I grew to love and hate the characters in a short time.
3,Snoozer,"I do know this was meant as some kind of satire, and that was very obvious to be shortly into the book. But there's satire and then there is over-kill. This is the latter. I only give it three full stars because I have severe insomnia and it worked better than any drug I have ever been prescribed for it."
4,Northanger Abby,I usually like Jane Austen books. I liked the movie and usually read book that are connected to movies. I would recommend if someone asked.
4,Fill out your Austen collection,"As a lover of Austen novels, it is well worth reading ""Northanger Abby"", which was Austen's first (but last published) novel. As her first novel, her writing style is still rough and lacks some of the refinment of her later works, but she still brings her sharp eye for satire and examination of societal/marriage topics. Catherine Morland pales in comparison to later strong heronies like Elizabeth Bennet or Fanny Price, but she's delightful to read and chuckle about her naive outlook on life."
2,very slow,"This is my first Austen novel, and I must say, I don't know what all the hype is about. I thought it was excruciatingly slow at times, and then all of a sudden it was fast and over. Some of the writing was beautiful and poetic, but that is like 5% of the book. The other 95% of the book was pretty boring to me. Maybe I am jaded by all the horror and mysteries I read where I am used to fast paced suspense, but seriously, I would read one chapter a day or maybe two with this book and that was all I could handle, because it would make me tired. I felt no connection with the main character Catherine, and I found myself not caring what happened to her, good or bad. I just wanted the book to be over."
2,Not interesting,"I had to read this for a class, and I ended up skimming through the book because I thought it was boring."
1,Buyer beware: No vampires!,"I was promised vampires. There were no vampires. Not even the sparkly ones.Curse you, James Austin. Curse you and the army of undead vampires that you totally failed to deliver."
2,"Austen's first effort, and it shows","First let me say, I like Jane Austen. I'm not kissing up to my wife, and I don't feel less masculine in admitting it. I like good writing, and Austen is clearly a good storyteller.That said, I'm not always really into the subject matter of her stories - romance, coming of age, etc. But she writes well enough that I generally want to keep reading. Additionally, I've always enjoyed the many film adaptations of her books.But I wasn't crazy about Northanger Abbey. It was her first novel, and you can tell. The story is painfully slow, the characters (except for the heroine) are underdeveloped, and in general the love story feels very Jr. High (except with wealth and British accents).If you're reading the whole Austen corpus, then by all means read this. But if you are picking and choosing, I'd put Northanger Abbey at the bottom of the list."
2,Miserable Experience,"I've been working on reading all of Ms. Austen's oeuvre, and all I have left is Persuasion. Reading Northanger Abbey was a miserable experience. The heroine is so insipid, and I could care less about the parody of the gothic novel. I'm reading Austen for her character-building abilities, not for her making fun of old novels I haven't read.The other characters were abominable too--Mr. and Ms. Thorpe, the Allens, the whole lot of them, Catherine as a child. And I thought for so long that the widower General was hitting on Catherine himself.I even had to listen to the audio version to try and move things along but it still made me grit my teeth and at times bored me to the end of my nerves.Well, if you only have one Austen to skip, skip this one. Or read it only if you're a diehard fan, which I am not."
4,Her Best Work,"4 1/2 Stars:Northanger Abbey is my favorite book out of all Jane Austen's works. I really liked Catherine, and her wide open heart and indomitable spirit. She was so easy to relate to and likable. All her adventures were interesting and kept me turning the pages. Catherine was defiantly my favorite Jane Austen heroine and out of all Austen's male character's, Henry Tilney is my favorite because he isn't pretentious (like Darcy in Pride and Prejudice), there is a lot of dialogue between the two (unlike Darcy and Captain Wentworth-Persuasion) and there's a type of friendship between them. Overall, I really enjoyed the whole book and would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys classic literature with heart and humor."
4,Another classic from Austen,"Jane Austen is the queen of subtle satire, and in Northanger Abbey she turns a sardonic eye toward the Gothic novels that are beloved by the protagonist, Catherine Morland, while also weaving a critical view of social conventions and women's roles. This is as riveting as her other works, with the addition of some laugh out loud moments as Catherine explores the ""secrets"" of Northanger Abbey with a foreboding instilled by her reading habits.There is spookiness, family drama, thwarted love, betrayal, deception and manipulation, as well as the sense that integrity and goodness will win the day as they usually do in Austen's works. This is another unforgettable classic."
3,"Good read,but a little trite.","Good read, but a little trite. Fun to read, but little overall message to it. The general theme is a bit lame."
5,Love it!,"Its jane austen, what more can i say, its a great read and its a great writer! More than happy!"
2,Meh,I didn't expect much and didn't get much in return. Only the faux Gothic parts were fun. Only read if you are a dedicated Austenite.
4,You don't have to read satire into the book to enjoy it,"eBook downloaded from Gutenberg. Catherine Morland's visit to Bath is enlivened by friendship with the shallow Thorpes and the fascinating Tilneys. Invited to accompany Miss Tilney to their ancient home, Northanger Abbey, Catherine expects to wander crumbling, mysterious halls but finds a modern, comfortable residence. The dictatorial General is the fly in the ointment, oppressing Catherine as well as both of his children.This is an early Austen and it shows. Austen's oddly cynical attitude permeates this unusual tale, frequently contrasting what is actually happening with what would usually happen in a novel. The story is disjointed and wraps up in a hurry, as if she had run out of paper suddenly. But the portrayals of both innocent and calculating characters are dead-on, as only Austen can manage."
5,"Nice font, easy to read","This is more a review of the free Kindle version of this book than of the book itself. It's Jane, so it's a good book. It's one from her earlier years when she was still using a much more exagerrated view of society, so it can be a bit silly, but I still enjoyed it. I read it years ago and had forgotten most of it.The formatting for this Kindle version was just great. It's not in Courier, probably Georgia or another similar font. Quite readable and I had no problems at all with it.Kudos to Amazon for making these free versions of the classics available to all. No reason to pay for classics that are out of copyright just to get a graphic cover. Who sees your Kindle covers? :D"
4,very funny!!,"Cathrine, the main character, is a great reader of dramatic Gothic novels. so her life is written like a Gothic novel. she is always thinking dramatic things are going on, like in the books she reads, and is so preoccupied with her own thoughts that she seems to be missing just living life. interesting things do happen in her life, travel, engagements, broken engagements, balls, etc. but she really is too busy looking for foreboding and giving everything a Gothic twist that, when all events turn out to be perfectly normal her ideas had only served to make the incidents funnier."
5,Fantastic!,"Although the introduction does give away the entire story, I thoroughly enjoyed reading about the adventures of naive Catherine Morland. The book is full of a cast of wonderful characters who you get to understand better not only from the author's descriptions, but also from their candid dialogues. I didn't put the book down until I had read it from cover to cover."
3,"An okay read, would not really recommend it","This book was okay, but the storyline was weak wrt the protagonist Catherine. I felt zero compatibility, or affection or passion between her and Mr. Tilney, so much so that their engagement at the end seemed forced and unbelievable. I didn't even bother to read the last few pages, I was pretty much done with the book after that. The only characters I actually endeared to were the Thorpe siblings, John and Isabella. I love a good book and this just was not up to par."
2,Ehhhh....,"Not one of Jane Austin's best works. Feels rushed, lack of story. It builds and builds and then just deflates, a little abruptly. Left me wondering where the other half of the story is."
5,Amazing Austin,"What is there to say.... Jane Austin was the most dedicated writer of her time. Inclusive of love triangles, mystery, intrigue and of course deceit. For an author writing in the 1800's she is just simply amazing. I will warn readers to give yourself a chance to decifer the ""language of the day"". It is well worth the effort because the result is a series of books that are unrelated to each other but formidable and of the out-most literary content. Enjoy every word I know I did!"
5,Great book,This was exactly as described. I was not disappointed with it. Bought as a gift and they loved it very much. Would recommend.
2,typical jane austen,"another book of hers i've read, and i swear, i can't tell them apart in my mind. it's almost as if you read one, you've read them all. most of them i don't even finish, though i did finish this one. not quite as good as P & P, but that could just be because that was the first of austen's work i read, and they all seem like P&P. the ending to northanger was awful. all tell and no show. but that seems to be a common problem with her, she summarizes too much and doesn't really tell us a story. still, one of her worthier books."
2,Not Cool,"I was not too happy with this seller. Yet, I am not sure if there was a problem with the shipping and handling or not. I needed this book for a class this semester and I received the book a few days before I needed to read it. We are reading it right now in class and it is a funny and classy book! I recommend reading the book! I do not recommend buying from this seller though."
2,Not an enjoyable read for me...,"This was my classic read for the month....since it was supposed to be funny, I picked it...Although it takes you into the English countryside and shows you the lives of people in this era, the story line was just too contrived and frivolous for me to get into.Jane introduces you into the lives of three women whose lives revolve around taking walks in the countryside and looking for husbands to marry...Jane's later works were so much better!"
2,I guess you have to like the genre,"I was mildly amused at first, but as the novel bogged down halfway through, I couldn't help but wonder if there was ever going to be an ending? What trivial and boring lives Austen satirized. Yes, this is satire, but it is not high satire. It's barely noticeable satire. I finally put the book aside, not even caring if the heroine ever gets the man who makes her heart thrill, or any man at all."
3,The Great Gatsby,"F. Scott Fitzgerald's masterpiece, The Great Gatsby, is definitely considered a classic for many reasons. The vivid details and outstanding descriptions of the setting are truly amazing. The major theme of this novel is the American dream which is portrayed with excellent hard evidence of the exact ear of the 1920's included.This has to be one of the greatest books I've ever had the pleasure of reading. The plot flows which makes for easy reading, but is also very interesting which makes the book impossible to put down. I strongly suggest that every person make time to read this amazing piece of American literature. It is truly a work of art which has be studied for generations, and will continue to be studdied for many years to come."
2,very hard to read and follow,"for me it was a very hard novel ,one of my friend recommanded that as a great book.I didn't finish it"
4,"American Social History - ""Old Sport""","F. Scott Fitzgerald has written a classical portrait of life in the 1920's in America. Nick Carraway narrates this tale from the sidlines more as a spectator rather than as a participant. Jay Gatsby, the main character in this engrossing tale of life among the party set of what has become known as the roaring twenties, is a somewhat vague shadow of a character especially when compared with the other richly portrayed personalities. Perhaps it a virtue of the book that Gatsby remain a mystery man to the reader. ""Old sport"" is a phrase overused ad nauseum and gives Gatsby a grating personal quirk that was off-putting to this reader. Perhaps this was intentional on the part of Fitzgerald to keep Gatsby from being a more sympathetic rather than tragic figure. This novel has become a standard literature piece in the college-level curriculum as it lends itself to many insights to the human condition."
3,A reader,"It is an average book with respect to everything: storyline, style, pace, and characters. I couldn't finish reading it even though it is a thin book."
1,"I have to rate this book even though I have not read it. Its for my Grand daughters English class,so this is not a rating",I had to order this book for my Grand daughter who is in High School and they have to read this book for English 3
4,Gatsby,"The Great Gatsby is simply a classic, I truly enjoyed it. Looking forward to the movie and seeing DiCaprio as Gatsby."
4,Really really good.,"Good fiction should offer some things to think about, but there's no reason the reader should have to force himself. A good writer ought to tell a story that is interesting enough to spark a natural curiosity in the reader over its deeper implications. The Great Gatsby is a good example of this. Fitzgerald subtly interweves social commentary into a solid story, providing entertainment for the casual reader and enough material for the critical reader to keep himself occupied.I only had two problems with this book: First, Fitzgerald's drawn-out, boring writing style, and secondly, the novel's climax, which seemed a little hokey to me. Other than that the Great Gatsby is a very good novel that I would recommend to anyone who has the patience to sit through boring narration (thankfully the story wraps up in less than 200 pages)."
3,An entertaining read,"Though it starts off slow (like most novels) and doesn't have a lot of descriptive detail, which I like, the characters and rest of the story are well done. I thought the theme and underlying message (i.e., image & materialsm don't equate happiness) was good. When reading the one review where the guy says he identifies w/Gatsby, I chuckled, thinking, 'Must be a doctor or lawyer' and wouldn't you know, he was a lawyer. What is it about these 2 professions? Maybe they're in their occupations for the shallow prestige and phony status, similiar to what Fitzgerald talked about. Enough of my ranting. Overall I'd say it was a good and worthwhile read."
4,American Classic,"Although a bit dry in some sections, ""The Great Gatsby"" can certainly qualify as one of the greatest novels in American literature."
2,See the movie,"Great Gatsby is required reading often in college, but why in the world did my book club choose to read it? We all have masters degrees and above and are all teachers or retired teachers and we had no clue what was going on in this renowned book. It was short and wordy. That is amazing in itself when you think about it. I even knew the story from having read it in college and didn't understand much of what I was reading. I had to go on schmoop after (a great site with summaries of classic novels) to find out what I was reading. This is a classic but far from what I consider great reading. I guess I am going to stick to newer choices after reading this or see the movie when it comes out in December."
4,Easy Read,"The story was interesting, but not spellbinding. It is a short, easy read. Not sure why it is considered a classic."
5,"Terrible editing for Kindle, amazing book","The book, of course, is wonderful and gets a million stars. But the editing in the Kindle edition is, frankly, an embarrassment. There are odd things going on with line breaks and egregious typos that occasionally confused the meaning of the text. For example, the following passage should read as follows:-- ""I couldn't get to the house,"" he remarked.-- ""Neither could anybody else.""-- ""Go on!"" He started. ""Why, my God! They used to go there by the hundreds."" He took off his glasses and wiped them again, outside and in.In the Kindle version, however, it reads:-- ""I couldn't get to the house,"" he remarked. ""Neither could anybody else.""-- ""Go on!"" He started. ""Why, my God! They used to go there by the hundreds.""-- He took off his glasses and wiped them again, outside and in.This was my first Kindle purchase and I am extremely disappointed."
4,The Great Gatsby,"The Great Gatsby is a novel written in the 1920s about the American Dream. The characters are striving for wealth and popularity and there are several conflicts on the way. The Great Gatsby is told in first person by a man named Nick, who just moved to New York for a more extravagant lifestyle. Jay Gatsby, Nick's mysterious neighbor throws lavish parties where only the wealthy residents are invited. Nick attends these parties and becomes close to Gatsby and learns many of his secrets.Many love triangles form due to extra-marital affairs which adds to the development of the plot. An old relationship is rekindled between Gatsby and Daisy, but Daisy has a husband. Daisy is ultimately faced with the decision to choose between her long lost love or her husband.By reading this novel, the reader gains an understanding as to what life was like in the 1920s. The Great Gatsby is a thrilling novel where you are constantly turning the pages to find out what happens next."
4,why so upset?,"Mariangeles, why are you so upset? Everyone is entitled to their opinions, and if you didn't like the book, there is no reason to berate others who do. I read this book in my summer school english class, and although it took me a while to get into it, I thought that The Great Gatsby was a well-written American classic."
4,Very good introduction to Fitzgerald,"This is the very first book by F.Scott Fitzgerald that I have read, and it was actually engrossing and interesting. There are parts that seem to move slow, but the author makes up for it with his amazing lyrical writing/description and his great characterization. The way he writes of the character's reactions and emotions seems so realistic, that is what I beleive will make it easy for one to read and get ""into"", so to speak.Now, yes, Fitzgerald was an alcholic, but that does not mean that he wrote this while being drunk. Quite the contrary; Fitzgerald is known for his notorious revisions - in which 'Gatsby' was revised several times before he was satisfied with it.I am saying this to basically let the reader know that it is very worth giving it a chance, and even though by the end it may not be ones' ""favorite"" story, however it is a very good introduction into the writings of F. Scott Fitzgerald."
4,An interesting & romantic novel,"At first I didn't want anything to do with this book. It was assigned as summer reading for my American Studies class. Before reading the book, I came online & read some of the reviews it received. I saw that a lot people thought this book was excellent. Well I have to agree with them. Fitzgerald moves a little slow in the beginning, but this story is so romantic and it didn't bore me at all."
5,A story of a rich man and his devotion to the woman he loves,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It's a wonderful book, which I couldn't put down. Though it may only be a story of a man, he was indeed a memorable one."
3,A Classic-Not A Masterpiece,"Fiztgerald's The Great Gatsby is the tragedy if not death of the American Dream. Jay Gatsby longs to become rich and captivate his only love. It depicts the longing to relive the past intricately yet adds a feeling of grand admiration for Gatsby. Gatsby was just a man, surrounded by attitudes and consequences. This book only lets the reader admire a fictional character while leaving him or her without a learned lesson or a thought to ponder over. I truly believe the essence of this book is powerful yet only for the main character not the public. I recommend this book to anyone who likes to read of made-up legends and unique characters but not to the the vivid reader who hopes to find a momentum to retrive from it and carry in throughout life."
3,Leaves you wanting more.,"This is a good book but not a great book. After deciding to go back and read some of the classics I fell upon ""The Great Gatsby"". The problem I have with this book is it leaves to much up in the air and you want to know more. You get a feeling for the 20's but not much since this is such a short novel and very little is written describing the 1920's parties and events. The people seem interesting at first but you never learn anything of value about them and why they are in their current condition. After reading 1984 and Slaughter House 5 I was enthralled by their charters and their situation but that just didn't happen here. Maybe Fitzgerald is showing how shallow the 20's era and people are bye making everything so empty and non-descriptive but that doesn't make for great reading by my standard."
3,"Good But Not ""Great"" (for me anyway...)","I really enjoyed This Side Of Paradise"" so I thought I'd have a go with this one. It is very well written,of course, and it does create a mood,but it failed to truly move me. I guess it was the narrator's detached air. I realize that literature is a subjective art form,so I'm not going to say""Don't read this book!"" because it might really ""speak"" to the next person who reads it. So get the book,read it and draw your own conclusions..!"
2,None,"The first time i read this book iwas bored because i didnt fully understand how Fitzgerald conveyed the plot of the story. But now i have read it again with a more mature state of mind I really find it like a soap oprah... there was evidence of gossip that placed a ""umph"" to the supension I had when reading. The love story between Daisy and Gatsby, with Nick and Jordon, Tom and Myrtle, and Daisy too, interuptions not to mention their individual ives, and how FItzgerald cleverly used elements of prose and literary devices, to convey confusion and suspense highlights the fact that this story was well written and will remain one of the best years to come."
4,Good classic,"I decided to finally re-read The Great Gatsby since I only read the cliff notes edition back in high school :) Great story, really transplants you right in the thick of things - 1920's New York City glamor."
5,What a book,Do yourself a favour if you haven't read this book.Pick it up and enjoy!!This book is a classic so just do it!
3,Not sure what the big deal is...,"I enjoyed the book but not sure what the accolades are about. I do, however think it will make a great movie see how all the party scenes are brought to life."
4,Gatsby,"Solid book. Interesting story/characters, great vocab, and a well-written glimpse into an earlier time in the high society of the US."
5,Perfect,"I recently re-read this after having first encountered it 14 years ago. What amazed me is how so many of Fitzgerald's phrasings remained with me during that time. It was like the story and the characters were timeless. My perspective on some of the individuals, however, did change. As a younger person, I saw Daisy as a more innocent actor in the final tragedy. As an older person, I recognize her silent complicity in evil. Years ago, I also saw Nick as naive. This time, I recognized that, in many ways, he grows throughout the story and becomes a good man.This is the first book in my lifetime that I've re-read. Based on the experience, I imagine I'll be doing it again and again with books I read as a younger person."
5,The great gatsby,"A classic tale that I can read again and again, still delighting in the artistry of the language and story."
1,Print too small - 6 point,"The print in this version of The Great Gatsby is too small to read comfortably - even for a 16 year old. It is only 6 point based on measuring only about 2mm tall. Buy another version. By the way, Amazon's return system is great. They are coming to pick it up from my house tomorrow, free of charge and I am getting the other version just two days after delivery of the small point version. Good service! I just could not take reading the small print this time."
4,The Great Gatsby,"Set in the 1902s, The Great Gatsby, is a captivatinig story about finding the ""American Dream"" of happiness. Nick Carraway tells the story of 1922 summer when he meets Gatsby. Love triangles form and disastrous events occur. Will the welth of the characters be enough to buy them the happiness they are sheraching for?I found the book to be interesting and thought it was well written. The story line was interesting and kept your attention. It portrayed the ways of the wealthy in the 1920s well."
5,The Great Gatsby,"The Great Gatsby is a story about the rich in New York in the 1920's, told through Nick Carraway's eyes. The main character is Jay Gatsby, an idealistic and materialistic character. Gatsby acquires his wealth to gain his lost love, Daisy. The Great Gatsby is a story that questions, ""What really brings happiness?"" This story written by F. Scott Fitzgerald is a critically acclaimed novel and is a must read for anyone over the age of 13."
3,A disappointment,"I had heard a lot about this book, but when I finally read it, I was disappointed. The plot is just too silly and predictable.... The only positive thing I have to say about this book is that Fitzergald writes it well. This novel is another example (along with ""Great Expectations"" and ""To Kill a Mockingbird"") of a bad plot well written."
2,i only read this book because my english teacher assigned it,"Truly, I know this is a American novel. This book to me, got boring really fast. The book didn't describe all of the characters enough, and I feel that if a book wants to be a good one, it should describe the characters. Anyways, like I said, I only read it because it was assigned to me."
4,The Great Gatsby,I have always meant to read this classic book - have enjoyed the film and now it coming out again with Leonardo Decaprio as the Great Gatsby I finally took the plunge. It was excellent - I must admit it me took a little while to get into the old style of writing - but once there it was worth the effort. No wonder it is a classic - it is wonderful to take yourself back to a bygone era when money and perceptions took over and no-one really knew where someone came from or how they got there. I loved it - would highly recommend everyone reads this book at least once in their lives.
5,The Great Gatsby,Reading this book in high school I did not fully understand how great of a novel this really is. Fitzgerald did a magnificent job in taking me into the jazz era and getting a taste of how mezmerizing and transforming the era was. One of my favorites.
2,The Great Gatsby is far too predictable,"This book is too predictable. I don't know if anyone who has read the book, didnt see the conclusion before the climax. To top it off every theme is spelled out for the reader. The title bewilders me and the allure of millions confuses me. All in all 'The Great Gatsby' should've stayed a flop, just as it was in Fitzgerald's day."
5,A decent classic worth a read,"This book is, yes, a classic, but a decent one. Most people have read it and most love it, but there seems to be a stubborn group of Fitzgerald-haters, so it's obviously not for everyone.The imagery stood out among all other good parts of the book. It is very lyrical, almost poetic. If nothing else, F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote a beautiful novel.Gatsby is the best part of the whole thing, too. Dark, mysterious, and rich, we never really get a good look at him (don't watch the movie for this reason), but he's an intriguing character, worth at least a glance.I don't know if this book is a classic, but I don't know what makes a classic. The story is well written and the scenery is gorgeous even if the plot is a little convoluted. This book won't change your life, as is noted by another reader a few reveiws down, but is worth reading once for any number of reasons."
2,a bookcover is different,I thought I was getting the one I saw on a picture but when I received it it had a different cover. I know I shouldn't judge a book by its cover but this one had NOW A MAJOR MOTION PICTURE printed on it. Not happy!
4,The Great Gatsby,"The Great GatsbyI enjoyed re-reading this classic because it gave me a picture of the world my parents lived in while dating, and it is such a powerful comment about how people in every era have a number of different levels in their personalities."
3,Good Book,"The Great Gatsby is a complex novel to fully understand. While many view it as a wonderful novel of romance, it is actually a tale of a man, Gatsby, who is wealthy and has every thing he desires except for the love of one person, Daisey. Daisey, however is portrayed as such a shallow minded person. Gatsby trusts her, and she takes his heart only to butcher it. Tom is an arrogant pompous man who is just as careless as Daisey, his wife. The story ends in such a tragic way, eventhough the event is foreshadowed throughout the entire book."
2,Dull. VERY dull.,"This is supposed to be an American classic? Personally, I've read better children's books then this. It's boring, useless, and basically states that rich people are boring, drunken snobs. The story went about no where, and I can't believe I even wasted my time to read it. The writing style was good. Imagine what he could of done if he had actually had a good idea for a story."
5,Aged to perfection,"And I mean the book and me. Although I am not perfectly aged. I mean by my title that with age, I have been able to really appreciate the beautifully poetic words that Fitzgerald used for his story. I think that teachers must assign this because they think the simplicity of Fitzgerald's words are easy for teenagers to understand. They may be able to understand all the words, but I really don't think most teenagers can truly understand the meaning behind the beautiful word choices Fitzgerald made. I for one, did not and I just loved this book the second time around. Life experiences make it easier to see Daisy and Gatsby for what they truly are, very shallow people. I think only Tom shockingly looks good in this book. He recognizes his life for what it is. When I was young, I really thought Tom was a bad guy. I feel differently after reading it the second time. I still see this as such a sad, sad story, where nothing happy takes place.A must read!"
5,a classic,"This classic book got my daughters attention when we saw a trailer for it when we saw the movie Lincoln, I put it in her stocking and she's already dug in. I remember reading this in high school, well worth reading again when she's done with it. Came very quickly and packaged well."
5,so much is packed in in a fairly short story,"not only is the an incredible snapshot of the 20s, it is a haunting story that asks powerful, difficult questions that are still relevant. One of my favourite books, ever."
4,A great book--to be read again and again,"Beautiful language. I can now say I've both read this book and listened to a reading of it, and there's so much complexity in the subtext that each time the tone suggested something slightly different.Regarding the story itself, more of a short story really, it seemed to me somewhat unremarkable. My primary pleasure came from wanting to learn more about this mysterious man Gatsby, who he is and what motivates him.The Great Gatsby is such an idolized staple of American literature that I grant myself several more re-reads to fully appreciate its genius."
5,Love love love it!,First off i'm probablly one of the least likely individuals that you would think would read this. I read this the summer before my freshman year of high school. I figured it would be easy since it's under 200 pages but I couldn't really apprecitate all of the literary genius used throughout the book. When I read it I really felt like I was living in the Jazz age and all the characters are distinictly different. This book really captures the spirit of America during this time period. This is one of my top favortie books and F. Scott Fitzgerald's greatest work. If you're considering reading it READ IT
4,Good book,This is a well written classic. I read it back in high school and enjoyed it so much that I bought it. Great read!
3,...,"For the most part I liked this book. The descriptions of the things, people, and places really brought you into the world."
4,"Great, just stick with it","I found the first few chapters of this book a struggle to read and enjoy, but once the love story line was set up and the two characters of Gatsby and Daisy were finally introduced (or re introduced) to one another I pretty much read the rest of the book in one sitting as I was so desperate to find out what happened to them. All in all, very glad I finished this and never gave up, great read."
3,hmmmmm,"I was both touched and frustrated by the style of writing. Pay attention to every line or you may miss something. The over arching message is universal, that wealthy people can make big mistakes in life too...The author seems to want to blame wealth for irresponsibility...a theme that is difficult for me to buy. Everyone can be there no matter what station in life. The real tragedy was Gatsby's investment in worthlessness. For that point I commend the author."
5,Best American novel of all time,"Classic story of the American Dream built around a romantic quest to recapture a love lost. Exciting, deep, poetic - I read it every year. The Kindle version is well edited."
3,Would read again,"I read this book in high school. But I didn't fully enjoy or understand it. Now that I have reread it, it makes a whole lot mo sense. I would recommend reading this book, it is a classic."
3,Seller had even highlighted important points in book! YAY!,"Took a little longer than expected, but book was in good shape (daughter needed it for a book report) and had no issues."
4,I love the 1920s,"This book is one of the 1920s most popular, and shows how life was back then. Before the depression, people had fun and would dance carelessly in the night to big bands and fox trot. Gatsby was an interesting character who had sort of a charm to him, and it just shows how during the 20s, not many people cared about affairs, racism, nor drinking. I feel Nick is obsessed with Gatsby because Gatsby has the personality and class he doesn't. The story is somewhat hard to follow at parts, especially near the end, but it has a nostalgic feeling to it, and basically is a portrayal of life during this time period."
5,One of the Great Stories of Its Era,"I reread this recently and loved it so much more than when I had to read it in high school. Fitzgerald's humor is so much more subtle than most humor writer's today and the funny lines are tucked between such beautifully crafted prose. The story is so simple - basically just describes a few parties at a mysterious Gatsby's mansion - but the humor and just enough foreshadowing keep you wanting to move forward. His observations of the young rich would fit in almost perfectly today. Inspired me to get back to writing my own book!By Jaimal Yogis, author ofSaltwater Buddha: A Surfer's Quest to Find Zen on the Sea"
2,The most overrated novel ever,"I really, honestly do not understand why this book is supposed to be a classic. True, it's a fairly nice love story, but there have been many better love stories written. The characters all seemed very one-dimensional to me, and the story was fairly dull. It's not a *bad* novel, but I cannot fathom why on Earth the Modern Library would rank in #2 on their top 100 list. I wouldn't have put it in the top 100. Or the top 1000, for that matter.If you want to read classic American lit, don't read the Great Gatsby - read Twain or Steinbeck or Salinger. Their worst books are probably better than this one."
2,You get what you pay for.,"The book arrived in a timely manner. The price was wonderful. What wasn't so wonderful was all the handwritten notes throughout the book. It made it difficult for my high schooler to focus on the author's actual writing because of the writing, underlined marks, notes in the margins, etc. I wish the bookseller had stated the extra marks. I would have picked a new book or maybe another vendor. Guess I learned my lesson, you do get what you pay for."
3,Not bad,This book was not as bad as I thought it was going to be. It was able to hold my interest. I want to read more books by this author.
5,The essence of the American Dream,"I've yet to read a better crafted book than The Great Gatsby. It is simply the most beautiful book you can come across. The prose is gorgeous and deceptively simple, all the more stunning for its simplicity, because it almost makes you believe you could write a book like this yourself. You can read the novel on many levels. Few readers can avoid finding symbolism. Daisy is the untouchable American Dream, perhaps, and Gatsby is the immigrant who, like all new Americans, throws himself fully into the idea of America while ignoring or hiding his own and America's reality. The opulence and decadence of 20s America is brilliantly conveyed, and there is also a considerably amount of realistic description of the time. The Great Gatsby more than any other book made me realise just how pervasive and persuasive the idea of the American Dream is, and just how empty the reality can often be."
5,Brilliant,"""~Although the Great Gatsby is a required read for 10th graders in the state of CO, my class did not have enough time to let us read it as a group. So, my curiousity got the better of me and I soon ran to my local bookstore and purchased a copy.""~ awe."
2,Soap Opera without a plot,"Although Fitzgeralds writing style is unique and diffrent, he failed to include a valid plot worthy of praise. His ""novel"" on the demoralization of America is nothing more than a over edited piece of literature. I fail to see how this book got an average of 5 stars."
2,"what is up with all the symbols..eyes, yellow, etc.","This book totally confuses me i'm supposed to do an art project on it and i have no idea what to do. The book had so many drags, why did the author use his symbols. What happened really at the end? And can some one give me an art project to do/"
5,The introduction comes after the conclusion.,"At the end of this novel, I finally understood why it is considered a piece of classic literature. Fitzgerald vividly depicts the gildedness of the Jazz Age without being obvious. Several plots are intertwined at once, offering an intriguing complexity that keeps your interest without confusing you. Nick's omniscient narration offers the reader a unique perspective on the corruption of high society, considering he is not a part of it. The poignancy of the story doesn't hit you until the end, but the ride on the way there is wonderful."
4,Perfect setting for moral decay,"Set in the 1920s, this now-classic-piece of literature has more than stood the test of time. Fitzgerald has so perfectly captured the era between WWI and the Great Depression, that it is forever engraved in our minds--the colors, sights, sounds, and even moral forays of the time. And all of this melds wonderfully with Fitzgerald's characters; the way carry on with reckless abandon. But don't think that Fitzgerald is preachy. No, he simply presents the material and lets you decided what kind of karma, if any, should be passed around. The beauty of this book lies in its simplicity (seeming) and execution. This is a keeper. Also very much enjoyed ""The Scarlet Letter, Bark of the Dogwood, Of Mice and Men, and Catch 22."""
2,not so great Gatsby,"This is the most overrated book of all time. It's all about ritzy partying, about the things that happen to people who party a lot. That's the great American dream -- sappy unrequited love before and after partying. I can't understand why it's revered in American literature. It doesn't have anything to offer but a melodramatic peek at the lives of very shallow characters. The characters sounded as if they were culled straight out of Beverly Hills 90210: The Jazz Age Version. The prose is masterfully done, but the story is just pathetic."
1,The Great Gatsby,"It was too ""wordy"". Members of the Book Club that I am involved in did not give it a good review. What makes it a ""classic""?"
2,Very boring book,It's one of the worst book I ever had to read. Mind numbing things that this guy does. I just don't understand why it's suppose to be one of the classic. I wouldn't have read it if I had the choice.
5,The Great Gatsby,My book was in perfect condition with no marks or tears in the pages. Great experience. I would buy from Amazon again.
1,The Great Gatsby,"I fail to see why this book is such a literary rave. It's the story about spoiled rich people with no meaning to their lives. If this is the best of the author's works, I won't read any more of his books. There are too many truly good books in the library."
1,why is this a classic?,"A bunch of rich snobs complain about how boring life is while putting down or bullying poorer people. Wow, great literature. I read about 30 pages, skimmed ahead, still didn't see anything of value, and gave up. Life is too short too waste on overrated crap."
1,not as advertised!,"The book cover shown in the ad and the name of the publisher are both different from what Amazon has for sale. The book actually is the commonly available Schribner edition with the so-called classic cover painted especially for the book. Click the look inside button to see what you are actually ordering. If the Oxford World's Classics edition is what you are looking for, you will be disappointed."
1,what's all the rave about,I don't like writing bad reviews for books since I would never want to defer anyone from reading a book just because I said it was bad but I just have to say how I feel exactly about this book. To be quite honest I have never been more disappointed in a book before. I heard many praises about this book but when I actually read it I kept asking myself what is wrong with so many people who think this is a great book...I guess it's because the title of the book has the word great in it.All it's about is this guy who becomes way too obsessed with a so said 'golden girl' and just dedicates all her accomplishments to her. It's a book about doomed marriages that ulitmately results in infidelity (what a surprise). It's no wonder the book is classified as a tragedy.
1,Wanted to know 300 words fun purchase detail,The following is a cut-up of other one-star reviews of this product.Exciting needs to stretch the mind. Mass-produced tickertape parade of sleeping pills. It needs to use sci-fi interest. Imagination murder is what makes the mind. A man spliced together out of old newsreels. 1920s self pity is a wonderful thing. View love in a distant manner.
5,A skillful warning about the pitfalls of the American Dream,"This book is written superbly. Fitzgerald does an amazing job of creating the feeling for his reader of being there with his characters. The characters themselves are purposely soulless people who have chosen to chase after the emptiest form of the American Dream, capturing its trappings without any of its sense of accomplishment. The characters and story are gradually exposed as you make your way through the story, learning who the characters are and how they became the way they are.Long after you finish the novel, you still feel transported to another time and place when you think about it. A wonderful American tragedy. Highly recommended."
1,Definitely not part of my book collection,"Bought this book because it was recommended as a great american classic.Once I finished reading it, I threw it into the ""poubelle""."
1,but why is it loved so...,"There is no need to establish that this novel is considered to be one of the finest pieces of American literature of the twentieth century, but why does this work deserve such praise, it's storyline is common, it's prose bore most, it's seems more related to a soap opera magazine than to a novel, but it is loved so dear to many, ... WHY? I recommend that this book is read just so people can say to themselves ""why"""
3,Overrated but insightful,"I am not surprised that this book falls into the category of one of the greats of American literature. The eloquence with which Fitzgerald writes with is somewhat rare, however the story would not have worked had he not. I was required to read the novel for my English class, and although I despise analysing literature I found the story impossible to understand without analysing it. It's a plot that you don't get engrossed in, but one that you eventually want to know the outcome. Recommend it to anyone? Yes. It's worth the read. Rave about it? No. It's not worth arguing if you meet some opposition."
4,Classic read,"I finally read ""one of the greatest American novels of all time"" as I've heard The Great Gatsby referred to. That statement may be a bit hyped up but it's defiantly a good read. Not a happy ending but some good lessons about wasting today chasing dreams from the past and what happens when we aren't happy with what and who we have now. Plenty of intrigue and drama will keep you reading. Most of the characters display the ugly, selfish side of human nature which contributes to the authenticity of this book."
5,Really good book,"This book was for my son that was reading it at school, It is a great book, full of excitement. The book was shipped quickly and was in great condition."
3,"Fab as ever, but microscopic print on this one!","I am so surprised that no one mentioned that you need a magnifying glass to read this edition of an amazing classic. I have 20/20 vision, but opened this and was shocked. This review has nothing to do with the story -- a true timeless masterpiece -- but this edition is not for the sight-challenged."
3,Intriguing,I am currently reading The Great Gatsby for my English class. I have found the beginning of the book a bit difficult to read because it jumps around. But I must say I'm intrigued and cannot wait to finish the book.
4,ANGRY REVIEWER,I would have given this book 5 stars if I hadn't read the reviews of a couple of idiots several columns down that give away the ending and key plot surprizes in their review. (You F#*@ing Idiots!!!). It completely destroyed my experience of reading one of the highest rated books written this century. If you are just checking out the reviews before read. WARNING: Do not read 10 reviews past the next. (THOSE F#*@ING IDIOTS).
2,Extensively marked up book,"Book arrived promptly. Sadly, though presented as in GOOD condition, the book was EXTENSIVELY marked up.Reading through these distractions degrades my reading experience."
2,"Depressing, Pointless (semi-spoiler)","As with so many ""classics"", this book does not hold up over time. It's not that I don't think we currently live in a society where most believe that wealth and fame will make us feel loved and happy. It's that in this day and age, it doesn't work to end a story without hope. We live in an age of mass consiousness raising. Yes, show us the ""evils"" in the world, but then show us what the alternatives are. Show us the answers. This book, and many that were ground-breaking in their day, tells the story of tormented people and was written by a tormented person, all who's lives ended tragically."
2,Pretty depressing,I thought it was a pretty depressing story and especially the ending. It didn't leave you wanting to read more.
4,Great classic,"Great classic literature. I never read this book in school, but read it along with my teenage daughter. I appreciated the book's story and glad I read it with her."
3,Decent,"I read it after the new movie was announced, decent book well written in simple english..nothing fancy at all. The writer does not create a 500 page monster by describing the hem line on dresses and instead keeps it short and sweet and at the same time gives you a visual idea of the scene. A simple story about rise and fall of Mr.Gatsby narrated by a another character."
2,"Too ""performed"" - avoid.","I am hooked on audio books. I have a long commute to and from work everyday and I can't wait to get in the car so I can get back to my audio book of the week. I was so excited at the prospect of listening to Tim Robbins narrating The Great Gatsby, a book I have wanted to read for a long time. I am a third of the way through and am terribly disappointed. This is the first audio book that I am struggling with. I am a huge fan of Tim's on-screen work but he is ""performing"" here and it's distracting. The variations in his voice are irritating as well...I am constantly adjusting the volume. There are other narrations of this classic out there - buy one of those."
4,Richly shallow,"What can really be said about The Great Gatsby that hasn't already been said? The novel itself is near perfection. In this Fitzgerald is a genius. Using as few words as possible, Fitzgerald has richly constructed a story as fitting of the American experience in 2009 as it was during the Jazz age--all glitz and glitter, pomp and circumstance based on thin air, imorality, and chimeric dreams. The Great Gatsby as a novel is a great achievement. As a story, it is bankrupt."
3,Great writing that didn't Sweep me Away,"This is not a bad book but it doesn't have the compelling story to me. I found the author very capable of crafting words, but I did not sense a ""I can't wait to know"" moments. Of course like all classics you have to over look the vernacular. The author also used a few words that I was not familiar with. This would make this book better for a more sophisticated reader. I am interested in reading other reviews by more learned people to see just how much I might of missed."
3,At least it was nice and short,"The writing is pretty good but unfortunately that doesn't make up for a weak storyline. The plot is so far-fetched in places that it spoiled my enjoyment of the book. The ending was particularly trite and melodramatic. The fact that this book comes in at less than 200 pages long is good because if you don't like it, well at least you didn't waste a lot of time. This is the sort of book that other ""celebrated authors"" apparently think highly of but many ""casual readers"" don't really enjoy it and I am one of the latter. Sorry, but only 3 stars."
2,"Great Symbolism, Unlikable Characters","Fitzgerald makes great use of color as symbolism in this book, particularly in the ironic use of the color white which represents innocence. It is to be noted, however, that if I hadn't had to do an assignment on the use of color in the book, I may not have noticed.As far as the story goes, I could not like any of the characters, nor could I understand their motivations behind any of their actions. I found myself questioning why they were willing to do so much for a woman who wasn't in the least bit interesting at all. This generally made it a read that I dreaded."
3,Not as Great as it Seems...,"While this is not a bad book, it is not the master-piece I expected. One of the reviewers before actually gave it a 4 star review despite the fact that she or he admittedly did not even finish it! This is probably what you'd call a biased judgement. The Great Gatsby is certainly an interesting book to study (as would be any book, in my opinion) but I cannot say I enjoyed it too much, even if the images and underlying themes are interesting. I have to say I read it in the Penguin edition, so I don't know about the preface of this one, but I found helpful the essay displayed there (always read these introductions and stuff AFTER you read the novel, otherwise it's merely a spoiler and it can't deepen your understanding of the book since you know nothing of it at that moment).Despite all this I cannot bring myself to give it more than 3 stars, I hesitated longly between 2 and 3 to be honest."
3,A book for a select audience,"I read this book twice - both times many years ago. Twice because after reading criticisms of the work I thought I must have missed something the first time. Still, the impression that I have is that of a book with a limited artistic range. Yes he used his colors well, but to me they're tepid and there's not enough of them. I think I ended throwing a few of my own in, projecting into the characters a frustration with themselves having to operate on such a shallow level. Gatsby himself - the most complex depiction - even he couldn't convince me that his desires, drives, motives, emotions, were inspiring enough to merit a book of his own."
2,REVIEW,"The novel, The Great Gatsby by Scott Fitzgerald is not a book for me. I felt like the novel was too boring, and dull. It was really hard to get into. This novel is about a man named Nick that lives next to Gatsby, who throws parties at his mansion every Saturday. He then befriends Gatsby. In the beginning of the novel, it was confusing when Tom showed Nick, his mistress. I felt like nothing really actually happened in the book. There wasn't really a plot. This book is supposed to be a reflection of the 1920s, but doesn't really exude it. The 1920s was fun and exciting, and this novel was not. Also the actual writing was way too eloquent and he used lots of big words, that was distracting from the actual plot. His writing was way to flowery, which made it unenjoyable. This book was just basically about affairs. I also didn't like how Nick was narrating it, because he wasn't a sole part of the plot. He was just there; nothing important. I don't understand why this is a classic..."
5,A classic?,When I was reading this I kept wondering how it could be a classic. After I finished it I realized I kept thinking about the characters and the things they do and what makes them tick. This is what makes it a classic.HOw Fitzgerald weaves elements of time into the plot and how shallow relationships can be.
2,Very articulate and slow moving book,Your suppose to read this in high school but I never did. I can understand now why I didn't. For all those people that can't sleep at night but this book it will definantly put you to sleep and make you get a good nights sleep.
4,Bought this book for my 16 year old,"My son needed this specific book for school, he wasn't to wired to read it, but once he did he actually like it!!"
3,Good but not Great,"I didn't find this book to be as great as everyone says. I was reading each night before falling asleep, though, and likely wasn't awake enough to fully comprehend everything. I'll probably read it again in a few years."
3,The Great Gatsby,My first encounter with Fitzgerald and I found his delivery strange at first butgot a grip on the society of the time and the hedonistic lifestyle practicesthat seem so far removed from the general populace. Interesting as a historicaldocument.
4,What's so great about the great gatsby?,"For sure, if i hadn't been told that THE GREAT GATSBY is a great american novel and that it has deep symbolism and profound meaning, i don't know if i could haue gotten through it. In fact, if i hadn't seen the movie (which i liked) i don't know if i could have gotten through it twice more (just to see if there was any there there), because the movie made the book come alive for me.The character of gatsby is dry, flat and incnmprehensible--i have never been able to relate him to any living, breathing person i have ever known. As a matter of fact, the only almost three-dimensional character is nick carraway (or is that sam waterston?)"
3,Gatsby,"Good read, worth the time. It didn't end how I thought it would but I liked it none the less. Hopefully the movie does it justice."
4,An important look at American society.,"Told from the point of view of an not always unbiased narrator, this novel captures the essence of the 20's as well as an earlyview of the divide in our country. Aside from the social aspects, it also tries to show the individual's responsibilities incontributing to that society and the failure of many of taking responsibility for anything other than personal needs.It is easy to see why this book is often used in literature classes and I would recommend it to serious readers."
4,It was sad and sweet and I knew it complete,This book takes a slice of a certain aspect of American life and holds itself up to inspection. What is love? How does expectation versus desire affect who we are and what we do?
2,The Great Gatsby,The Great Gatsby is a story of one man's struggle to find happiness during the booming 20's. He surrounds himself with wealth and throws parties he does not attend to bring back his one true love. This story captures life during the 1920's very accurately and shows that wealth can not buy a person's love or happiness.
2,The Great Gatsby,"Nick Carraway, a young man in the ""Roaring Twenties"", relates the tale of his friend, Jay Gatsby. The story follows Gatsby's search for an unattainable ideal of love through wealth, eventually leading to his downfall. This novel portrays the very spirit of the 1920's, also exposing its dark side. Very well written, but a dull plot. It failed to draw the reader into the story, nor did it make the reader really care about the characters."
5,The Best Book Ever!,"The Great Gatsby is a wonderful tale of an era. It is intriguiging, suspensful, and a well-written novel. The TNT movie of this is just as great!"
4,Life Without Meaning,"Firstly let me say I found this book unusually interesting and unlike many ""classics"" easy to read. The tale is a romance, Jay Gatsby longs to be with Daisy, a girl from a different social world that he knew for a short period of time mamy years before. On a different level the book describes the pointless existence of the idle rich and their dissatisfaction with their lot, although set in the 1920's it is still applicable today in many ways. The characters Fitzgerald paints are shallow and undeserving, having achieved their wealth through inheritance or crime. The author clearly is critical of his creations, but at the same time seems to be entranced by their mixture of style without substance. My one dissapointment was the lack of any character I felt I could identify with or empathise with, even the narrator Nick Carroway came across to me as having few if any endearing qualities. Probably just my personal prejudice in a novel rather than any literary requirement."
5,Oh to be a flapper.,"The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald is a piece of Americana. I read this book in high school, of course this book was assigned to us and boy did I love this little tale of murder and love in the Roaring '20s. Gatsby and Daisy's secret passion for each other kept this book a page turner, it's intriguing and i love the twist ending, if you don't like this book then there is something desperately wrong with you. One of the best books I've read, the first is The Catcher in the Rye. I hope teens are still reading this in high schools today. Classic, great style of writing from Fitzgerald, flows well and easy to read. Buy The Great Gatsby today!"
5,Loverly,This is book is one of the best books I ever read. Fitzgerald's drunken mind was at its best in this one. The illustrated version is the best. I never knew women could even get in that position. Probably comes from the schitzopherenia...Pop Tarts will steal your atm card when you aren't looking! The bannana in this pie envies my cold stare. READ THE BOOK and save the Rice Krispies.
3,The Pretty Good Gatsby,"There is little to say about this ""classic"" that was written over a half a century ago. Not as timeless as some would have you believe. Not as bad as others my age would have you believe. Read it if you are really patient."
2,Eek,"Yes, I'm but another unfortunate soul who had to go through this book because of the wretched school. Let me try to be fair, the book started decent. I thought the writing style of the author was good, but nothing egregrious. I was interested in finding out about the narrator, of course, the story turns and introduced a mob of characters from parties and dreaded plots. It was plainly, and simply and tediously S-L-O-W. Reading this book is a torture. Okay, that was my first impression of the book. After finally reading it through, however, I guess I should say it was better than I thought. The story speeds up a little, still retaining the air of elusiveness. It is hard to grasp the theme of The Great Gatsby. But perhaps when you do it is worthwhile to you. Though I still feel unable to relate this story very well. But different people have different opinions."
2,Awful. Like Reading the Yellow Pages,"If you're thinking of buying the Great Gatsby (a classic example of the literature elite trying to cram a book down the people's mouths as a ""classic""), read the yellow pages instead. It is that moving.With so many truly great books out there (anything by Vonnegut, Catcher in the Rye, anything by Voltaire, etc.), why waste your time on this?"
1,Uninspired,It grieves me deeply that we Americans should take as our classic a book that is no more than a lengthy description of the doings of fops.You would do better reading the Iliad.
1,Not a review of the book. A review of the eBook.,"If an eBook costs money, like this one does, I expect it to have a searchable contents, so that I can easily skip to any chapter I wish. This is shoddy from Amazon. Don't sell it, or make it free, if it can't have that most simplest of things. Makes me wish I'd pirated it instead of wasting my money."
1,I just don't get the big deal,"For years I have seen this book on every list of great, must-read books. I finally got around to it, and I was left confused and incredibly disappointed. At no point did I really care about any of the characters or the plot. I kept waiting for it to get better. I kept waiting for something dramatic or enlightening to occur. Nothing ever happened that made me understand why so many critics, scholars, and avid readers adore this book. I am an educated woman and was an English major in college, so I don't think this book was ""over my head."" I would gladly read Chaucer, Shakespeare, Milton, Steinbeck, etc. over and over again, but I don't think I'll read Fitzgerald ever again! The Great Gatsby is an oxymoron because it is NOT great!"
1,Boring,This is one of those novels you hear about your entire life and finally get around to reading.What a bore.The stilted language is like trying muddle your way through Beowulf in Middle English.Save your money if you're just dying to read this book and get a used paperback version.
1,This book is so bad,"The Great Gatsby is a book that I absolutly hated. I could never get in to this book. It was so slow and I could never pay attention. Every time I would read it I would fall asleep. I could never get through 3 pages with out taking a break or already sleeping. If you were to ask me what it was about I really would not be able to tell you, because it was horrible.It was a bunch of people that were friends and I do not even remember if there was truly a point to this book. I do not even know what the plot was. I know that there was one but i do not know what it was. It was not even that long ago that I read the book and I do not even remember what it was about.Actually I do not even think that i finished the book because I just could not bring myself to finish it.Well, if you are looking to buy this book to read for pleasure then I suggest that you pick another and if you have to read this book for a class or something then I am so sorry."
2,gatsby wasn't that great at all.,"Use this book for my ESL english class, but as an story the book is to short and the best is in the middle and too simple for the new generation in this time when there is better books out there. Un libro muy simple y muy corto, la historia no es tan buena pero te deja un poco corto de reading. no es el mejor y para las nuevas generaciones hay muchos libros mejores que este."
1,so boring i wanted to kill myself,"back in high school, after we were finished with the book, my english teacher told us he never understood why this book was so highly regarded. he called it ""stupid."" i had never agreed with a teacher until that moment."
2,"A good story, poorly told","I skipped this in high school, reading it now for the first time at 55 years of age.Despite the rave reviews, this emperor has no clothes. In fact, this book is a model of how NOT to tell a story.The tale itself is excellent; compact and full of surprises and irony. But it is submerged in such a wordy, tedious, self-absorbed monotone that the reader can only appreciate it in retrospect, when they have dragged it out of the muck, shaken it free of detritus and seen its bare form.Prose, be damned. A good story, told for the ear of the reader, that's where prose is.I feel genuinely sorry for every young person forced to read this when there are thousands of better choices."
1,"Boring, Boring, Boring","I hated this book with a passion. I am a sophmore in high school and was made to read this book for class and I despised every minute of it. Maybe it's a book for an older crowd, I don't know, but it was a complete waste of my time. The love story was predictable and the characters were obnoxious. I like books when I can fall in love with at least one character. That was not the case with this book. My advice- don't waste your money."
4,"How about ""The Very Good Gatsby""","I don't think ""The Great Gatsby"" is a perfect novel, but it is better than most I have read. I enjoyed the story (in as much as a story of this kind can be enjoyed). Reccomended."
3,Its made out to be more than it is,"This novel started out very slow and elongated a plot that beomes tedious to read. The pace picks up toward the middle and devolops a decent ending. I felt Fitzgerald could have been more manifest in the book's overall meaning and sumed up the general meaning in fewer words. This book is not all it's hyped up to be yet a decent novel. I might have enjoyed the book a little more if it hadn't been put up on such a high pedestal. If you decide to read this novel, dont go into it with high expectations. However the author does do a good job of tying the book up together in an organized fashion."
5,"It's the prose, stupid!","I think Fitzgerald has the smoothest-flowing prose in American fiction. That's why I got so absorbed in this book -- even though some of the characters are people I know I wouldn't especially like in real life. I found myself questioning myself ""Why are you continuing to read about these fatuous individuals? Do you really care what happens to them?"" But I couldn't put the book down. I felt I was right there, actually participating in the storied 1920's decade, albeit a certain slice of that famous decade (which many liken to the 1990's). That's the magic of good writing.While Great Gatsby brings a distant generation to you, today's young generation (or a certain slice of it) comes right to you in ""Love Songs of the Tone-Deaf"" by Asher Brauner. In a similar way, this book has a hero you don't especially like at first, but the whole story is so engaging and the humor is so charming that you can't put it down either."
4,THe Great Gatsby,"I thought that the book was very interesting. It was about the only book that I was able to read and like in English class. I thought that the ending was unexpecting, and I loved it for that . I love surprises. I really recommend this book to those of you that are thinking of reading it. I really liked it. I hope you will too."
2,The Great American PC Bore,"Wouldn't read Fitzgerald after the obligatory HS Gatsby tour. Boring progressive high school teachers of course praise a ""cautionary tale"" that warns about the ""meaninglessness"" of the ""American Dream"" (progressive trademark attached to that phrase) as if there were a mass disorder everyone who doesn't subscribe to their pablum suffers from.Then, I read the short stories collected in Flappers and Philosophers and a couple of novels, This Side of Paradise, The Beautiful and Damned. Well, Fitzgerald had quite the cool imagination. I tried to re-read Gatsby to see if my opinion had changed.Leave Gatsby to those who think The Catcher In The Rye is a great book. Catcher was written by a phony using the subjective voice of a phony adolescent surrounded by straw-phonies. Fitting choice of protagonist.Nick C. is not much of an improvement on Holden C.Fitzgerald can really write, so 2 stars. Read Flappers and Philosophers, This Side of Paradise or The Beautiful and Damned instead."
4,It's an amazing written piece !,"I am a 16 years old girl, and just finished reading the Great Gatsby ! When we got the assignment to read this book, I thought: ""Oh no, another boring book to read this year !"" But this one is certainly different ! Fitzgerald, describes everything so carefully, that you immediatly start imagining yourself the scene. It's like you are there, standing next to the main characters, listening to them very carefully! Every word is precisely chosen to explain us the character emotions and the mood in a particular scene ! This is simply an outstanding book, which makes you understand how difficult writing must be."
2,Overrated,"I just dont get all the praise heaped on this book. There are some good passages, but in the end it left me sorely disappointed. Compared to Garcia Marquez or Proust just doesn't have a way with words. And shallow characters are given better treatment in Hemingway's The Sun Also Rises."
1,Great Gastby,"The book was a spark not version of the book, and it did not state that ANYWHERE in the description of the book. i am highly disapointed because i now have to go out and buy the actual book. it was very a big disapointment. i will never buy something from amazon again."
2,I HATED IT!,"AM I THE ONLY PERSON IN THE WORLD WHO HATES THIS BOOK?!?!?! I found the characters insipid, vacant and superficial, and I know that's the point Fitzgerald was trying to make, but instead of being deeply moved and inspired by the depiction of our society as shallow and meaningless like THE REST OF THE WORLD, I found myself incredibly disgusted and repulsed. I know this is the Great American Novel. I know that I'm supposed to appreciate it for its sublime beauty and honest portrayal of the Diseased Elite. But I don't."
2,I liked Raise the Red Lantern much better,"Perhaps as a previous reviewer noted I missed some fundamental points of this novel. I hated it and couldn't stand the characters. I also couldn't help thinking of Su Tong's novella, Raise the Red Lantern. It takes place during the same time period, but in China. It's also about some wealthy individuals who make ruining other people's lives a sport. The difference is that Raise the Red Lantern is a much more interesting and suspenseful book."
1,Wrong Version,The book details say it is a Scribner edition.I needed the Scribner version for class.I received the Collin Classics version.USELESS.
1,The Great Gatsby.....a big disappointment,"Very disappointed in this book, which is supposed to be a classic. Did not even finish the book. This will be my first and last experience with F. Scott FitzgeraldThe Great Gatsby"
2,INCREDIBLY slow unless you understand the symbolism,"To understand the book, it's a good idea to understand the meaing behind colors and to identify the pages where the colors appear and how they correlate with the books content and overall message. This is not a novel that is simply an enjoable read. Constant analyzation and understanding is needed throughout the process of reading it. Only after understanding does the novel become a literary classic and icon."
