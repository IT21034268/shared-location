3,it fits the bill,"This subwoofer appears well matched with its price. If you live in an apartment or townhouse thisserves your needs well, it won't bother your neighbors and it offers a fair articulation of notes withphysical bass note body pressure."
4,Great Sub,"I'm an audiophile with a small house so when it came time to buy a sub, size was one of the primary concerns. There are smaller subs that use 6.5 inch speaker(s) but I had room for this 8 incher and I am very pleased with it. It seems to be very flexible in it's configurations. I have a sub output from my preamp so that is how I connect to it and it works just fine adding plenty of bass to my system."
2,Reliability/Quality Control issues,"The first unit I received made a constant rumbling sound, even with no input signal applied. The seller (Electronics Expo LLC) replaced this unit promptly. The new unit arrived and went into use. Six months later the PSW111 failed, and now does not power up. The protective fuse is blown, indicating internal component failure. Although I am satisified with how this unit sounds, I am alarmed by the rate of defects."
4,powerful and beautiful compact woofer,"Watching movie is very good. But when listen to music you need set the volume be over half then you can feel difference. It is an excellent woofer. I like the sound, size and style."
5,Saved $164.00,"Looking around for a sub that would fit my budget for my Family room I found the Polk PSW111. This is going to be my 2nd sub, my main sub in my main room is a veloydne but the budget required me to look at other subs. The PSW111 does a great job on movie soundtracks, such as the canons in Master and Commander. The punch was right on and even a slight ringging of the canons can be heard after the shot. All in all a fine sub for the price. With coupon code WS901X5750 I was able to get the sub for $154.99 shipped at Electronics expo!"
4,Put this in our RV...,Used this to upgrade the home (RV) theater.. :-)It was a big improvement over what came in the coach - but doesn't have the punch a larger unit would put out.We were space constrained and this is what would fit in the space we had. I would say we are happy - but could behappier.. :-)Great Value and Price..
5,Great little sub,"I was looking for the best subwoofer that gave a good kick, but was still affordable. I stumbled upon this and read several reviews before settling on it. Its fairly compact, but gives a great kick. I have it set up in my living room that's about 18'X18', so my room isn't large, but it also isn't small. For the size of the room, the sound is great and i only have it up about 60-70% of the way. I would definitely recommend this to everyone looking for an affordable, but still rocking, sub."
4,Polk PSW111 Subwoofer,"The Polk PSW111 is a good subwoofer if you are looking for one that is small and can be hidden in the corner of a room. However, don't expect it to produce the ""bone rattling"" vibrations of the larger options."
2,Not too impressive,The footprint of the subwoofer is small but so is the sound from it -- nothing very impressive. Perhaps that is why they were giving it away with other speakers purchased.
5,Great room filling bass,Adding this speaker to a new set of satellite speakers really turned the system into a great quality system.
3,sub woofer,"Seems like a well made product, sturdy and attractive. Sound-wise, it seems like the it could do a better job with overall bass rather than being very heavily weighted toward the sub-bass. Yes, I know, it's a SUB woofer. Maybe it's just not what I was looking for."
5,Major league subwoofer,Polk Audio doesn't fool around. This baby delivers a lot of bass - enough that I need to turn it down a bit.
4,Great sub for the price but needs corner placement,"I would have given this 4.5 stars. The deduction is because it is extremely affected by placement, though to be fair that's true of any subwoofer. I'm a little surprised that this one has lost almost all its punch now that I've moved it out of the corner, though. I would recommend a bigger sub if you need to place it along a wall in anything bigger than a 12x12 room. My living room is a little cavernous and I probably should have bought a bigger sub myself.If you've got a corner for this, though, the sound is tight, the connections are good, and I think it's a very attractive piece of audio equipment. I've got it hooked up to a Polk SurroundBar 50 and the overall effect is very nice for not much more than $1000 total."
4,Very Impressed,"I got two of these for free at my local Frys for purchasing a certain amount of Polk Audio spearkers. I was kinda hesitant of wanting these because I didn't think 8"" subs would give me the sound and power that I needed. Boy was I wrong, just one sub alone really impressed me with the amount of low frequencies it produced without giving me that rattling noises. I say I got a really good deal."
1,Buyer Beware,I can see only negatives; and returned the very same day.I have other polk speakers which i like but this product is a shame to Polk's profile.CONS -1. Bad construction.2. Speaker grill flimsy and can break any time.3. No tight bass4. Muddy and boomy sound5. Bad price point6. Control Switches at the back are cheapo and can break any time.7. Packaging was bad as mine had the outer box ripped off.8. Very heavy compared to other counterparts given its small stature9. Package does not come with subwoofer cable.10. Return was bit difficult as i has to call multiple time to send the RMA since it is was not sold by Amazon.
3,Dissapointed,"After all the rave reviews for this speaker, I was looking forward to hearing it for myself. I found myself needing a new CD player and receiver.I chose the yamaha CD player which I like and the Yamaha RX 471 receiver. When I added the Polk subwoofer I was Dissapointed in its performance. I maxed out on the volume and still could not get the amount I was needing. What I got sounded good but not what I wanted and I was not looking for a mega bass sound. I thought maybe I had a problem with the cable going to it. I changed cables but still no improvement. After trying different solutions I decided to send it back and look for something else."
4,Anatomy Not Physiology,"My thirteen year old daughter just completed this course and did very well. It is a very good human anatomy course. It is excels in definitions and body functions. It is not a physiology course as it is advertised to be. The chemistry is nominal. There are no chemical equations or reactions to learn. Besides, no high schooler has enough organic chemistry to really understand physiology. This is not an advanced placement course. It is a good high school level course in human anatomy. Do buy the CD Rom with the book otherwise you will miss the videos of the lab techniques."
5,As reviewed by Amber - A Real Witch: I like it!,"Entertaining and accurate, a lighthearted yet serious adventure highlighted by history, truth, and witch-wiseness. Is Eisenkraft-Palazzola sure SHE'S not a witch? No, it's not a book of Wicca, as other reviewers have noted, but something very different, engaging, and wise.Thanks. Blessed be."
3,weakest of the lot,"I first met the club as a tween in the 7os. I've just re-read the first two, and read the last two for the first time as an adult of 42. The first two hold their charm, but the Big Chunk of Ice goes in too many plot directions with mad character Axel and ghosts, as well as being bogged down by very very dated 60's slang speech patterns of the ""hep college girls"". Also from a feminist perspective it's very backward."
2,Stay away,"As a child, I loved the first book of short stories. When, in my post college years, I found The New Adventures, I loved those too. The Big Kerplop was pretty good. This one, however, should have stayed unpublished. The Professor is irritating, and gives a horrible view of science. The girls are ok, if dated. The boys in the club really don't do much of anything. Where's the cool techie toys (ham radio and so on) that were in the short stories? Where's the adventure? The only sense of wonder in the entire thing is when the boys are finding the passageways in the castle.So again, give this one a pass. There are reasons it wasn't published 30 years ago. It is the Mad Scientist's Club, so I won't give it only one star, but ..."
3,Disappointing in the end,"I bought the book to complete my set. It has its fun moments, such as when the mayor pulls every string he can - including those of Washington - to ensure the boys get off on schedule because he will do anything to be rid of them for a while, or when the boys navigate the Blimp. And the fun with geography and Germanic phrases is a riot. It isn't quite the same without Harmon Muldoon, but having the boys face dangers on the glacier and meet up with creepy guys like the butler Axel and ""The Smellow Fellows"" makes a change of scene.However, in the end I was disappointed, but I can't say why without giving any spoilers. And having the two student girls named Angela Angelino and Angelina Angelo is just way too absurd to be even coincidence! Brinley probably intended it for comic relief (he has a lot of fun with people's names in the book) but it's not even funny because it stretches credibility too far."
3,Not up to MSC standards,"Having read the original short stories so many, many times, and always with enjoyment, I waited with great anticipation for this final installment. I suspect that the author's manuscript was largely unfinished and this was finished by someone else, perhaps someone without his background in science, as it is much different from the short stories or ""The Big Kerplop."" I'd say it's 30% Brinley and 70% editors. Too much silliness and far too little science from Henry, Jeff, and the rest of the gang. The professor routinely says things that Dinky or Freddie would find ludicrous. The girls are not an ornament to their sex either."
4,WALKING WITH MOHAMMED,"A bittersweet coming-of-age story set in Tehren during the years 1909-1940. I became absorbed in young Mohammed's life whose joys are few but whose spirit guides him through poverty, seductions, and betrayal. He is a man trying to find Home.Shary's research and knowledge of the Persian landscape gives the story a richly textured setting. She explores the different lifestyles between the classes and between the genders. Political and societal progress is noted as Mohammed finds he must change, first, his mode of transportation and then, his alliances.For those who like finely drawn exotic landscapes and a happy ending after much travail, this book is definitely for you."
1,This is music?,"The truth, indeed, shall set you free! Unfortunately this title is way off because there's nothing about truth in this guy's music. It's all lies. I gave it one star because there was no option to give it zero stars. This music belongs in the garbage. Dudes like this market thier trash to young people which I think is dispicable. This garbage belongs on porn sites and in the sewer. Don't support that kind of garbage by purchasing this!"
5,this mixtape is a killa,"man ever song on this is tight. i got this cd but it is called pre-release theraphy. these are the same tracks. if anybody would have heard this, they would killed to get luda's new cd."
1,disappointed,"I had this item for less than six weeks, actually microwaved in it less than 100 times(six minute intervals max) and the glass the glass tray cracked! The warranty states one year on all parts. The glass tray cost forty dollars(including delivery)and Panasonic reps say the glass tray is not part of the warranty. I had to decide if I wanted to spend another forty dollars on a glass tray that might explode again and the company refuses to examine the cause of the cracking. You can determine if the cracking was due to abuse or thermal in nature. Caution on purchasing this product. Examine your glass tray prior to use!"
2,also disappointed,"thought this was a great microwave while it worked, but it only lasted 14 months in a single person household. it had a good review with Consumer's."
4,"All in all, a rather decent book","The good points: first, the book's emphasis is on trading the open, offering a straight forward strategy for playing momentum type gaps. Second, the book has a thorough review of TA basics filtered by practical and experienced advice. Third, there were several odds and ends (like NASDAQ having two data feeds, do the S&P Futures really say anything, etc) that were indeed helpful.The not so good points: while, its all there, you have to really read the text carefully to extract what you need - meaning it could have been better organized for flow in some chapters. Second, a week in the life ""Trading Week"" would have been more satisfying if it had been two weeks long and not one (the author might disagree).All in all, a rather decent book that I value for its level-headed, lets stick to the basics, here's what really works kind of thinking."
4,A good map of Portland,This is a good and inexpensive resource for Portland. It easily folds up to fit in a small purse or pocket. It is also waterproof and easy to read.
3,Meh,Not everything it is cracked up to be. I would go with a regular map that they sell everywhere instead.
4,Easy to work with,"I have a couple of these Streetwise Maps now and find them a joy to use. In Portland there are a few streets I can't find, so an index of some kind would be good. But generally they are so easy to work with - no complicating folding schemes - that I would recommend getting one today. I also have an Artwise Map of London by the same company. Terrific!"
2,I should 've saved my money.......,"I liked the idea of a small and portable map of Portland, Oregon but found this one mostly worthless and was left home when I travelled. Perhaps it would be alright for someone familar with Portland(in which case why have the map)but for my usage I found it confusing and hard to read. If I didn't travel with a Garmin GPS in the car I'd still be driving in circles in downtown Portland."
2,Not at all helpful.,You can hardly read anything on this map it is so small. Waste of my money especially since it doesn't cover northeast Portland very well.
5,Utters do it again' S/T 's really are the stand outs,"Im suprised alot of people dont like this installment to the swingin' utters already amazing discography, i would recommend this to anybody with an inquiring mind. I am into the street punk genre but to be perfectly honest there later installments are just great in comparison with there slightly bland earlier efforts (which are still good) so pick up a copy if you can and just listen to the utters perform at there best. One more thing the drumming is fine throughout the album which is good with the exception of ""the note"" its really out of time ..."
5,Marvelous,"It's about time Collective Soul comes out with a concert DVD, and this one does not disappoint. The addition of the symphony orchestra gives Collective Soul's already timeless songs an extra punch sure to send chills down your spine. A must have for anyone who has ever remotely enjoyed Collective Soul's sound."
5,"Collective Soul ""Home"" DVD & CD","TOTALLY AWESOME! One of THE best collaborations with a symphony orchestra I've ever heard, and best of all, it's a ""Youth"" orchestra which collectively goes hand in hand with their recent CD release titled appropriately, ""Youth"" (have ya got it yet?)The CD with the orchestra is just awesome and the DVD as well, along with the great music it also has great pictures and behind the scenes footage! IF you haven't heard of CS, why not??? Well if ya haven't then go get your copy ASAP because you ARE missing the BEST!!! ANYONE who hasn't picked up their copy yet needs to rush out & get one today, you don't know what you're missing...music history in my opinion...MUSIC HISTORY!Sincerely,Collective Soul Forever & AlwaysKimberly C."
5,they hit this one out of the park,I've been a collective soul fan from the start and album's like this is why I keep listening.Done very tastefully
5,"Another hit from the ""Soul Machine""",This is an incredible live show. To hear Collective Soul accompanied by the AYSO was completely amazing! It gave me chills to watch and to listen to! Thanks CS.
5,Home live,"CS is one of those groups who sound better live, in many ways, than they do in the studio. They have a much fuller, stronger sound, which is enhanced by the orchestra. Ed's voice wobbles a bit at times, but he is a great showman. Love the dvd of this, love the cd. This is a MUST HAVE for any CS fan."
5,awesome DVD!,I think it is a great dvd. The entire dvd is amazing! I love all of the songs. Collective Soul sounds just as good live as they do on cds. This is a must have.
5,El mejor DVD que tengo,"Una super produccion, con todos los exitos de CS y las nuevas canciones de Youth el cual es un excelente cd, uno de los mejores de CS..... lo recomiendo"
1,Collective Soul,Love the album if I could listen to it completely. there is a nice scratch in the middle of the cd. I love Collective Soul and have seen them several times in concert just a shame I got a crappy cd.
3,"Good acting , so so plot",A model is offered a sum of money to pose nude for a shady agency. What follows is a strange chain of events that eventually ends in murder. The model fearing for her life decides to lay low and is swept into a web of lies and deceit as she finds none of the people around her can be trusted.
2,This Controller is Garbage,"I bought this as a replacement for one of my original xbox controllers thinking, well hey -- it's a little cheaper and my kids love Spidey. What a mistake. This controller is flimsy and poorly made; the buttons are squidgy; the cord is *not* one of the break-a-way kind; and whatever vibrating unit they stuck in there is . . . well, it's just not right.Stick with the Microsoft controller, or at least try the others out in the store before you lay down the money. The Spiderman design just isn't worth using such a rotten controller."
4,Too Big for Females,"This neck warmer is too big for females, but it was easy enough to sew a straight line up the back side to make it smaller. I love the material!"
5,Pickachu Cake Pan,"Easy directions to follow. Pickachu is my daughter's favorite Pokemon character, so this was a big hit for her birthday. I would recommend this cake pan."
1,"High Price, Low Abilities.","3 people claim that they like it. I wonder if they are associated with Just Home Medical and/or the bedwettingstore.com.The transmitter is an uncomfortable blob worn at the waist. From there a wire leads to a clip attached to briefs like a regular Malem alarm. So the basic difference here is that the wire for the wireless alarm is shorter than the wire for the standard alarm. Still a wire! The receiver is a battery driven item. Don't expect too much of it. Also, the transmission is only one way - from the transmitter to as many receivers as may be used. All of them have to be within range of the transmitter on the child's waist. What a waste. Also no remote to control anything. For this high price, this item should have more abilities than ANY other wireless alarms. And some of the others are truly wireless. Look for detailed descriptions and comparisons of wireless bed-wettingalarms . Then you can be your own judge."
1,consumer alert,"I too like the last few reviewers have been ripped off by this company. I saw the laser storm on tv and ordered one and never received it and then my nightmare really started when I saw on my statement that I was charged for two. I called the company and literally waited 1 hour before I could speak to someone, and within 2 minutes of my conversation was disconnected. I called back and waited another 45 minutes and spoke to someone who informed me that there were no vacuums available and that my refund would be in 12 weeks I was furious and now here it is 12 weeks later I have no response to my email or phone calls and am going to get the local news involved. If anyone reads this and would like to take action with me email me at IBARX@AOL.COM This is unbelievable that they are getting away with this."
1,singerlaser is a RIPPOFF!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I ordered 3 singerlasers in Aug of 2005 didn't receive them I was told I would get a full refund and I never got a refund either. This company is ripping everyone off No one is receiving their vaccums or getting their refunds.You people should be ashamed of yourselves doing business with them I will never order anything from Amazon.com again Anyway when I did order from you morons you sent me the wrong btu's for one of my air conditioners So you ____ ripped me off too!!! Oh by the way This item is rated minus 000000000
1,Don't waste your money!,"How Singer can give their reputable name to a piece of trash like the 'Lazer Storm' vaccum is beside me. I received two vaccums (one was supposed to be free) one didn't work, the other worked but after every 5 x 5 feet I had to empty out the vaccum as it cloggs up and won't 'suck' again until it was emptied. The extra long cord they have is no longer than any other vaccum I have tried. The filter has to be washed every time the vaccum was used because the fine dust etc. clogs it up. If you're looking for any type of customer service from this company, forget it! It's totally non-exsistant! I phoned many many times and found there was absolutely no option of speaking to a human. Email? I was sent an email that told me to phone the 1800 number, then absolutely no reply to any other emails that I sent. I was charged for things I didn't order, and didn't receive. Save your money and buy a decent vaccum."
1,0 Stars----Singer is Bad News,"I ordered this vacuum after viewing Singers infomercial. What a mistake!!! I ordered 1 vacuum for 79.99 and was supposed to receive a 2nd vacuum for free. Imagine my surprise when they deducted 400.00 from my checking account!!! I immediately called to cancel my order, which they did and assured me my chcking account would be credited with the total amount. Big mistake...it was all down hill from there. It has been over 6 months and they still have not refunded my money. Bottom line...I have no idea of the quality of this vacuum...BUT the company is uncaring, unethical...and they Lie!!!"
1,A sucker born every minute,"This was THE worst purchase I think I've ever made.You should consider the info-mercial hosts nothing more than side-show barkers, rounding up suckers.My biggest complaint is that the filter gets clogged very quickly and since simply tapping dust off (as suggested in the afore mentioned info-mercial) does absolutly nothing to dislodge the dust from the filter, it must be rinsed to clean.They also forget to mention that filter must air-dry before returning it to your vacuum. What did I ever do to Singer?I am NOT a happy ""Stay at home Mom""."
1,"not original, p[eo-PLE!","Now where have i heard this before?? Duh! Of course, its the music style first heard on the soundtrack to The Triplets of bellville, music performed on the 76sth Oscars by French band Betty!!! So go get that and leave these imposters on the shelf."
4,Great sprayer,"This is a great sprayer. I like the fact that it holds 3 gal. The gallon marks are clearly visible, making it easy to know how much liquid you have. The pump screws into the top of the sprayer so you don't have to bend to pump it up, which is great. There is a pressure release valve to vent the sprayer at the end of the job, which is very useful. The green top has a handle to cary the sprayer and I would suggest being careful not to tote it by the pump - you don't want the pump to break off. For those who care, the hose and sprayer trigger and nozzle are all plastic."
1,"leaks,short hose,junk nozzle= trash!","The relief valve on these are just junk. The nozzle is junk. Hose too short. For a company that builds a junk product and aims it toward people with bad backs and disabled people on fixed incomes, they should be ashamed. I have no respect for them. It will be the last Gilmour product I purchase. I returned this garbage and bought a better brand. The word china on this is only an upgrade. Total waste of plastic.tall pump does no good if I have to hold it up to spray with it because the hose is too short. Then its still a back breaker.Anyone who thinks this sprayer is good has never had a good sprayer. I have an 8.00 sprayer that works much better than this."
3,Gilmour Sprayer,"The merchandise arrived on time and in good condition. However, the nozzle has a small leak. Do not know if the leak will get worse with use."
1,Doesn't spray,"Not sure what I'm doing wrong. I pumped it full of pressure, but the design of having the liquid always below the spray hose prevents the material from coming out to spray unless you hold the stupid thing upside down. Is there a part missing?"
1,Pump didn't hold up to normal use,I have had this sprayer about two years and was happy with it until the pump stopped working today. The pump is a plastic cartridge that is not meant to be opened or repaired. It feels as if the plunger handle became detached from the part on the inside which pushes the air. Today I also went to lookup a heavy duty metal oscillating sprinkler I have that stopped working and discovered that it is a Gilmour product too. Needless to say I'll be avoiding buying anything more from Gilmour.
4,Gilmour Pump Sprayer,"This is my second Gilmour Pump Sprayer. I bough one a couple years ago to spray insect killer on my yard and bought another this year to spray weed killer. I saw some complaints on other reviews where people have had problems, but I have never had a minute of trouble with either of mine, and I use them a lot. I like the pump being above the liquid level and I like it being higher so I don't have to bend as far to pump it. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that I wish the wand was a little longer; I have to bend over to spray close to the ground when spraying selected weeds. They have longer wands for sale, but they cost too much. The advertisement reads as though you get 3 spray nozzles, but you don't. The one spray nozzle that comes with it is adjustable and works fine. If I buy another pump sprayer, it will be a Gilmour."
1,noose,"a noose, thats all you need to go with this music. every second is torture. i now really hate tool, and piano music, and music,thanx tool!"
2,universal iphone holder,"I wasn't overly pleased with how the ""universal holder"" barely fits my iphone. I have a Jeep Wranger and an Iphone with the Speck tough case.....and it's practically sticking out half way...Also, the holder isn't too stable when i try to adjust it to my cup, it frequently tips over. The whole mount feels very unstable and the connecting piece on top often won't snap back in place. If i had to do over again, i would buy a different mount...all in all it works but it's very annoying to use."
3,Irregular results,"In the dual cup-holder in my Chrysler Pacifica, this rig fit in the driver's side half of the holder, but was actually too large to fit in the passenger side. No amount of adjustment helped, so I'm stuck having to reach around it to move the shifter.In its normal state, though, it's stable, holds my Droid securely, and doesn't tip. With a dash as big as mine - and as far away from the power adapter as a window-mount would have been - this was a nice alternative, at a decent price."
4,Arkon Cup Holder for iphone - Back for seconds,"I have had my Arkon cup holder for about 2 years. It's not perfect, but it is very good. I am using it in a Ford Explorer. After two years, the grip and release is starting to fail, but it has gotten a lot of use. I use a case on my iphone that makes the fit tight, but it works great."
1,what is this?,"I would really rather buy a nice house than get a three foot cable. i can't beleive you patches made this 1,000,000 dollars"
1,It doesn't like the picture ???,"It seen that stuff has two drum caliper (on the picture), but in fact they send me that product whit one drum caliper. It is very disappointingBecause I'm looking for cherokee brake caliper with two drum (like seen on the picture)"
3,"Good book, but not very informative","""Civil War Re-Enactment"" is hardly informative about the Civil War or Re-enactments, nonetheless, it is a good book with excellent photographs. I purchased this book in hope of discovering the mechanics of certain uniforms or the workings of re-enactments, this book did not help me at all. But, I do not regret buying. If you want a book just for the pictures, this book is for you. If you want a book with any information whatsoever, look somewhere else."
3,"Great pictures, not much else","I would only recromend this book to fellow reenactors who like looking for comrades in the photos, or for people who enjoy real pictures of men in action. Though it could have gone into more detail. The only text in the book is captions for the pictures. I've tried to figure out which events are which, but have come up blank. The main reason that I purchased this book was because it had a picture of my 1st Sgt and Captain. This book is recromended for reenactors and fans of good photography."
5,Works Great,"I have two of these. Connected to one is my HD TiVo, Xbox 360, Wii (wired), and HD-DVD player. This switch, in turn, is connected to a 2nd switch of the same make via a long (50-foot or so), cheap Cat5e cable. Connected to the 2nd switch is two computers, another TiVo, and my VoIP telephone. This switch is then connected to my Verizion FiOS router. Connections to all devices are just as fast as you'd expect and I get my full 15mbps on the WAN side (which I better, seeing as how they're 100Mbps switches). The bang for the buck is very good for this switch, IMO."
5,Works great,"Allows 7 Computers to share the same connection. This is the main backbone for my college house, directly connected to it are a wireless access point, xbox 360, playstation3, 2-laptops that suck with wireless and PC setup as a media server streaming to all computers on the network. Excellent work with no noticeable lag. Wish I would have bought a second one when circuit city was going out of business because it works great for setting up a full house to run wired internet. Yes, I know wireless is wonderful but you can't beat the security, stability, and currently faster speeds of wired. Have unit attached to DI 604 Router, also that is another great feature, no need to know about uplink ports as it can automatically detect making it perfect for novices.CONS:It isn't a gigabit ethernet which is what things are drifting towards, but if you don't require bandwidth intensive transfers between computers on your network it perfect for internet sharing as well as file."
5,Quick and easy way to expand a network.,"The most difficult part of the installation was removing the clear wrapper from the box. Connect power to the switch, plug in the ethernet cables, and the switch starts moving data. Under Windows 7 Home Premium 64-bit, no drivers or configuration was needed. The front panel LED are unobtrusive. I wish everything could be this easy."
4,"Nice, simple...",does the job! Light weight so it doesn't become cumbersome when plugged in to my little Sansa clip. I can plug into the front RCA inputs and just let the MP-3 dangle.
4,Great fun to read and look at,"When you're a parent and you read 3 or 4 books before bedtime, finding books which are fun to read is a priority (especially when you read the same book over and over again.) This is one that my son and I both enjoy--about a man who goes on a cruise and finds that he's sharing his cabin with a group of mischievous and misbehaving pigs. Though they get in everyone's way, he comes to love them. Great fun to read (it's written in verse) and fun illustrations as well."
5,Help is here!,"So this is what motivates Gen Xers! This is an outstanding book, especially the chapter about 21st Century challenges. The content about telecommuting, matrix management, appraising when there is more than one supervisor, and flex time is a big help in guiding me through the challenges of a new era in management. I have bookmarked numerous pages in this refreshing new book and I recommend it to both managers and their employees."
4,"fun for dogs in their ""teenager"" years",Our 10 month old Labradoodle had other toys and was a good dog. Then he started shredding a few things and not minding after we'd been at work all day. Our vet suggested puzzle style toys to see if he was bored and needed a mental challenge. We bought a few but this one is BY FAR his favorite. He loves his Bee's. There are a few tiny holes but he plays with this non stop. After 3 weeks this is still his go to toy. Resist the urge to help your pup early on. It may take him a few days to get the bee's out but your pet will get it. All in all this is a well made toy that made a big difference in our high energy dogs behavior.
2,2-stars only because my dog loved it,"I have a dachshund mix and when I first bought this it loved this. However one of the bees broke after 2 hours and the hive broke after the first day. Its a cool idea but its just cheapy material, but for $10 I was expecting a it to last a little longer."
5,Super Fun,"This is a toy that your kids and your dogs will love. Your kids will love putting the bees inside the hive and then your dog will love finding them, pulling them out and running all over the house playing with them."
2,Not very sturdy.,"One of my dogs had the hive and one of the bees ripped to shreds in one day. I have lots of toys around, and this is the first one to be destroyed. I've had the squirrels-in-a-log version for ten years, and it's still intact. Been through five different dogs."
3,Cute toy-but NOT durable,"I gave this to my Border Collie at Christmas time. Today is Jan 5th and I have already had to sew the bees back together twice and replace 2 of the squeakers. He LOVES the toy- too much I guess. Unfortunately he is also smart enough to get all 3 bees out in 30 seconds or less. So, for fun I rate it 5 stars... for durability, 2 (but typical for any plush dog toy)...for challenging/time consuming, a disappointed 1. I don't necessarily regret the purchase because he enjoys it so much but I will not be buying another."
4,bbbbzzz,"I got these for my dog Bea. She loves playing with the bees and pulling them out of the hive. I'll also stick other things in the hive for her to get.One down side, she tore the hive first time she played with it. I would like it to be a bit sturdier."
2,Cute Idea but my Cavalier chewed through them in 5 minutes,I loved the idea of this puzzle/toy but expected it to last longer than 5 minutes. May be OK for a dog who doesn't like to chew. I wouldn't recommend it for dogs who DO like to chew.
4,Fun dog toy!,"My 8 lb maltese just loves this toy. I often put treats in the ""hive"" and then put the bees in it and let it entertain him. We also play ""fetch"" with the individual bees.I only gave it 4 stars because I think a more ""intense"" dog will probably have this thing shredded after a while. My dog is not that intense with his toys and rarely destroys them."
5,Interactive Toy,My dogs love this. It is sturdily made so it can take a lot of chewing and throwing around. Good value.
4,Keeps your pet occupied,"A little harder to remove the Bees from thier hive(compared to hide a squirrel) but still as entertaining. I have a Pit Bull so she destroy's everything, ripping out the stuffing. So far the bees are still buzzing, when I come home from work it is the first thing she grabs, she loves it."
4,Love these!!,"I don't know what it is about these bees, but my girl loves them!! She has the squirrels but they were getting a bit ratty after 6yrs of play so I ordered the bees. She loves taking them out of the hive and carrying them around. I frequently find the bees in the couch or under the covers in bed. Great toy!"
4,Not bad for the price,"My two dogs (a 12 pound rat terrier and a 16 pound terrier-mix puppy) really like this toy. The whole item is much bigger than I expected, and my little girls just love to squeak the bees! This is well-worth $4.00!"
4,Kyjen Hide-A-Bee Pet Toy,My dogs loved this toy. Very well made. The only drawback was the hair on top of the bees heads. My 2 small dogs as soon as they got the toy had some of the hair in their mouths. I just trimmed the hair down. I do not understand why alot of dog toys have this sort of hair on them. This can easily be chewed off and swallowed.
3,"At least for my dog, did not relieve destructive tendencies","I have a beagle terrier mix, who loved plush toys, but would destroy them within minutes as a puppy. Many recommended the Hide-A-Bee because removing the bees from the hive would satiate her destructive tendencies. It took her a minute or two figure out how to remove the bees the first time, but she went right to destroying the individual bees, and I had to remove them from me. After her first time, she could remove the bees in less than 30 seconds and she was back to trying to remove the squeakers.I did not give it a terrible review, as it seems to work for many dogs, but if you do buy this toy expecting it to cure destructive chewers, you may be disappointed."
4,Okay - Don't Last Long,"Got these for our lab for Christmas. He loves eviscerating the the toys to get to the squeeker. It took him approximately 5 minutes to gut and remove the squeeker from the three bees. We purchased a replacement bag of four bees, and in another five minutes had those squeekers removed. Just trying to buy time so he would leave kids alone while they tried to open their own presents. So bottom line is that the dog loved them, but they just were no match for a rambunctious 100 pound lab."
3,"My dog loved it, but the bees slowly got ruined one by one.","My pit terrier took 2 months to slowly rip this to shreds, but before he did he loved it! This one is alot easier than the others, I feel like he took 2 seconds to get all the bees out of the hive. He loved sticking his snout into the holes andjust walking around like that, LOL. I wish it was stronger, but for what I paid for it he got his use out of it."
3,Dog chewed up the bees!,This product had so much potential! My dog liked playing with it and was nosing his way in to get to the bees. The problem came after he got to them! He started working on bee #1 and by the end of the day he had chewed through all three! He is a pretty dedicated chewer so I don't know how an average chewer would do with this. He still plays with the bee hive and carries it all around the house! :)
4,It's good product but my dog doesn't know how to play,My dog doesn't have patience to dig out every bee. He shoke one out and kept biting on that same bee. He doesn't get an idea what this game is supposed to be. Not the product's fault though.Large size is perfect for my 13 lbs poodle mix.
5,Very cute dog toy,"My two dogs love this toy. Keeps them busy and out of trouble, at least for a little while.Very fast delivery and a durable toy. Was also a great value."
1,STRONG CHEMICAL ODOR,"I got this for our Grandpug for Easter. It's a great toy and he loves it and therefore should have 5 stars.BUT there is a very strong chemical odor to it and the box too. I put it outside for a few days, but the smell was still there. Only after spraying it every day for a week with febreeze, and I mean saturating it everyday, the odor got less but there was still an odor. I had the empty box that it came in in my garage and the chemical odor was nauseating. This product is made in China. I would not order anything made by that company again unless I can find it in a store and smell it first."
2,Pomeranian chewed bee eyes off in 5 minutes!,"This is an adorable little toy--however, my year-old Pomeranian male chewed the eyes off one of the little baby bees in five minutes! We have yet to FIND THE EYES! Wonder where they went? Would I buy it again?--probably not--I don't want to be worried about my dog swallowing toy parts(eyes and stuffing) and waiting for it to come out the other end!NOT GOOD! Cute, but not a good match for Bandit!"
3,Squirrel one better,"I bought this for our dog this year as he enjoyed the squirrel one so much last year. Well it took a few months for him to destroy all the squirrels and a year to completed destroy the house part, this year it took about 5 for him to rip the heads off the bumble bees. The house section appears to be of the same quality as the squirrel one. They should redesign the bumble bee."
3,OK,"My puppy really liked this at first, but now he is bored with it. He really only is interested in it if I am there playing with it (squeaking the squirrels and hiding them) with him."
5,Toys,"My dogs love it, play all the time and sleep with them. Arrived in time and I would tell everyone this is a must have."
4,My Beagle loves these!,Just like the squirrel set (which I highly recommend as well) this set keeps my Beagle entertained for hours. This set is smaller than the squirrel set as you get 3 bees but the bees are fairly large. The yellow is a nice difference from the multiple squirrel sets (though I don't think he cares) but the shape is different which gives his a different challenge. The bees don't seem to last quite as long as the squirrels. Not sure but the squirrels are stitched in such a way that makes them very durable. Rated a 4 star because of this but for a small dog I would give 5 stars.
1,Hide-A-Bee Pet Toy....would not recommend for strong chewers,I was very excited to purchase the Hide-A-Bee pet toy for my dogs but the excitement was short lived. I purchased two of them and within a couple of hours they had them shredded and had stuffing/squeakers all over the house. Both Rosie and Tinkerbell can be rough with toys but this is the first time I've ever witnessed them chewing a toy apart so quickly. After I cleaned up the mess Tinkebell found one of the squeakers she had hidden somewhere in the house and almost choked to death. I had to wedge my fingers in her mouth and perform a doggie heimlich to get it out....very scarey but thankfully she's okay now.I would NOT recommend this toy if you have strong chewers in your home and it was a big waste of money. I'll stick with the large rubber kongs for them from now on.
3,"Cute toy, not the best","I bought this toy and the ""hide-a-squirrel"". Though my dogs like the squeakers on the bees, they don't ""dig"" into it like they do the squirrel. Not sure if it is because there isn't a hole in the top like the squirrels....If you are looking at this toy, look at the squirrels first. All 3 of my dogs go NUTS over them, the bees are left for whomever didn't get the squirrels fast enough! (This is still a good toy....I would just recommend it 2nd to the squirrels)"
1,Pit Fail,"My pit bull was having a blast with this toy, but as soon as I left the room for a minute I came back to bits of fabric and stuffing all over. I managed to salvage the bee hive for a nice nest for my sugar gliders, but this toy was definitley not made for larger dogs."
5,Doggie Loved It,"Innovative and fun product. This is even something a little kid would like. Also very durable, my dog usually is able to take the stuffing out of anything but this has held up for 6 months now."
5,A great dog toy!,"We bought this toy after purchasing the ""hide a squirrel "" toy and our dogs enjoy this just as much. It washes in the machine and comes out good as new. Very happy with this and is good quality"
2,Consider this my dog's review,"I thought this toy would become a favorite, but despite the appealing concept, the size and ease of chewing, Max, the toy poodle, simply never showed any interest in it. You just never know what will strike your dog's fancy; it's a guess every time."
1,10lb dog ripped it up in a week.,"The idea of this toy is great. Our 10lb Cavachon (Bichon/King Cavalier Spaniel) loved playing with it and getting the little bees out. Unfortunately in less than a 1/2 hr of opening the package one of the bees was ripped open. The next day the 2nd bee was torn apart and finally, within a week the 3rd bee had a wing ripped off of it. Our dog isn't even that rough with toys! I figured at least we had the hive that we were still able to stick other toys into and she could have fun with that...until last night when I found her chewing the white stuffing out of that too! This was a total disappointment after reading such positive reviews."
1,Do not buy if you have a large dog!,"My 90 boxer had this in shreds in a matter of hours! Cute concept, but not made for a larger dog. He does still enjoy playing with the bees though."
3,Fun but not much of a challenge for our lab,He still enjoys yanking the bees out of the hive but it doesn't take him long at all. We'd picked this up while searching for toys that would challenge him intellectually.
1,Not durable at all,"My dogs really liked this when it first came out of the box but within less than an hour, the bees were unstuffed and ruined and the hive had been torn apart. This might be great for a non-chewer or a tiny dog but definitely wasn't meant for strong chewers or big dogs."
5,CHILL OUT?,"Somebody wrote, you should turn down the lights light a candle and chill out to Exuma. You can't 'chill out' when Exuma is on the box. I remember hearing this album for the 1st time at a party in Queens about '70 or '71. Obeah Man came on and the whole crowd got into this groove. I was like a man who'd just discovered fire. I needed to share this with the world. After obtaining a copy of the album, I played it at a party in Philadelphia. Weird. The whole crowd walked in an orderly line and cleared the joint out in 3 minutes. Tried it at another party in Philly, some of the same people but the atmosphere was different. The crowd caught the groove and it was like New York all over again. Then I knew Exuma is special. The instrumentation: awesome. The lyrics: awesome. The concept: awesome. I CAME DOWN ON A LIGHTNING BOLT. NINE MONTHS IN MY MOTHER'S BELLY. WHEN I WAS BORN THE MIDWIFE SCREAMED AND SHOUT. I HAD FIRE AND BRIMSTONE COMING OUT OF MY MOUTH. I'M EXUMA. I'M THE OBEAH MAN."
5,EXOTIC EXUMA,"I love this recording not only for the intrinsic experience of it, but also because it takes me back to a wonderful period of time. We acquired it in the early seventies, while we were planning to leave our life in NYC and travel in a camper with our family for an indeterminate length of time. It was one of about sixty audiotapes that we took with us on our odyssey. We rarely got radio reception while we lived on the road, so we listened to those sixty tapes repeatedly for two years. Exuma's sounds always carried us to even more exotic places than those through which we were passing. When we settled down, we continued listening to it. Somewhere along the line, the audiotape was lost. I was thrilled to find that it had been reissued as a CD. I still listen to it every week or so, even though my personal music library is a lot bigger than sixty albums."
4,Mill. Classical review,"This is a great set of recordings for the money, the only problem was I've had to clean some of the CD's before they played correctly."
3,disappointing,"I have bought some excellent Laserlight box sets in the past: Piano Dreams, and Meditation - Classical Relaxation. I have also bought some other Laserlight box sets where the sound quality was awful. The sound quality here is quite OK and the performances are passable for those who don't know better, but the selections are disappointing. You should beware of what you are getting: 20CD's, each containing the greatest hits of single composer. One CD of Bach, Beethoven, Mozart ...and one of Richard Strauss(?), Ravel(?) and Grieg(?). Where is music from early in the millenium, and where is Bartok, Shostakovich and Stravinsky? Where is the thoughtful organization that let's us hear the evolution of our music? The title of this box set is a bit of a sales gimmick..."
5,"an excellent introductory set, but don't buy at this price!","i can't believe this set is selling for $80 here. i bought this set years ago at circuit city for $35. last time i visited, there was still one on the shelf. *shrug* i would definitely try and find it cheaper, but even at this price you're not getting ripped off completely. all of the recordings are of good quality and the selections are actually pretty damn good compared to other ""best of"" sets."
2,ineresting,"This unconventional novel is about German society after WWII. It is unconventional in the way it tells the story and some of the quirky devices such as the lack of use of quotation marks. They are not really missed though. The story, what there is of it, comes through in snapshot like paragraphs. Much is left out and left up to the reader to figure out. It is an intelligent work. Not compelling but certainly interesting both for what is says and how it says it."
3,Don't keep as solid as ice,"They're good for times when you don't want leaks. However, they don't stay as cold as ice cubes I think."
4,Icy cools,The icy cools are perfect for what I wanted and I do reccommend them. I used them to keep some medicines cool while I was flying to North Carolina.It was mission accomplished without the mess of real ice cubes melting.
3,"Okay, but...","These will stay cold long enough to drink a beverage in a glass, but the manufacturer claim about 30-50% longer than ice is a stretch. The advantage with these cubes obviously is that they won't dilute the drink.Buy two packs, not one. You'll be surprised how little volume you get in one pack.I haven't had any break. Each and every one works as intended."
1,Its ok.,"They don't stay cold for very long and they take up too much space. I wouldn't recommend these. If you use them in drinks, they do end up making the drink taste funny. My husband tried them with his water jug for work and didn't like them at all."
4,Great Product...Could be a little bit better!,"These things are so close to being the perfect substitute for the real deal. Like a lot of the other reviewers say, they leak easily and have to be thrown out one by one. But the benifits of these gems, do make it worth replacing them when you get low.My thought is this: Why can't they make these little guys more durable?!?! I know I'd pay a little more if we could just keep them from leaking! (I know, the company likes that they leak so they can sell us more.)"
3,too small and hard to clean if putting into liquids,"These are about 1 tablespoon of water apiece. An ice cube that small doesn't pack a lot of cooling power. That isn't so much of a problem since you can use lots of them, what IS a problem is cleaning them if you use them in drinks and the like.I bought these because I thought they'd be great helping me cool soups and stews so that I could put them in the fridge safely. The concept of tossing them into the liquid and having them chill without diluting the way plain ice cubes would was attractive. But then you have to clean them... Try washing a few dozen tiny pieces the size of a tablespoon of water and it gets old quickly.So if you are getting these to pack around items they probably work great; the small size lets them conform easily. But if you want to toss them into something to chill it without diluting it by melting, probably not the best for that."
3,"Handy for small spaces, but don't provide high enough temps","These were helpful for lunches that were tightly packed, but didn't keep the lunch cold all day. We had to switch back to a larger ice pack."
4,Reusable Ice Pillows,"I do taste demos weekly, and these are wonderful at keeping my taste samples cold. They normally stay frozen for 1 1/2 hours, but as they start to melt, keep their cool temps for about 3. The only downside to these little gems are, they leak pretty easily after a couple uses. But their postives far out weigh the negatives. As I'm doing my shows, people are amazed of this ""concept"". Great product!!"
3,Fun Read,"I really enjoyed reading this. I got through it in less than a day.There were a few places where the book felt lacking. First was diagrams, while he rattled on and on about various alphabets, I would have liked to see some graphics to help illustrate the advancement of the each written language. Also, there were times when I just wanted to skip certain areas of the book, but I am glad I finished it. I lent it to some of my friends (some who were language enthusiasts and historians) and not everyone else could even finish it, because they didn't agree with some historical views in the book.Overall, I'm glad I read it. But I definitely feel like it was more of a light introduction into the topic of how writing developed rather than a definitive resource."
1,Hard to make it through,"I love Ironman. I have done two. I think the stories of how most people get there are amazing. That is not captured in this book. Even as someone who loves the sport, I had to force my way through the book."
5,Great Read!,This book is a great read for someone training for their first IM. The stories give you an idea of what to expect when the big day comes. They also are very inspiring.
3,Wasn't what I thought,This book is great to read about different stories of various people who become Ironman. Just a collection of short stories. It was interesting.
2,Bad Interviews,"I found this book very amateurish. The author purports to tell the story in each subject's own words. Sometimes, though, ones own words aren't very good - that's what authors are supposed to do - think through the words! I guess some of the stories were inspiring, heartwarming and even somewhat interesting, but in the end I didn't get much more of this than ""I decided to run the Ironman, so I trained really hard and I did it""."
4,Works great,This little heater keeps my Generac 4.6L diesel warm and ready to start in all the cool tempratures we have in south Texas.
4,This is a history book and everyone should own it.,"I learned allot about the Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade and that there were also white indentured servants. This book has over 5oo biographical essays on some of the most important Africans in our history. It covers music to religion and science to sports, ranging over a 400 years period. I love reading it and learning about a part of American History that was left out of my history classes.I would recommend it to all students in school and all students of life."
4,Just the product I've been waiting for,I ordered this produCt for my 5th child who loves the water and loves his hip carrier. It really helps me to be able to play with the other kids and it keeps his head out of the water when I'm in reasonably deep water. I use it almost every day. I did take it on a trip to a water park and my back was hurting by the end of the day because the weight of the baby is entirely on my shoulder and back and not on my hips. I would have given it 5 stars if it had a hip belt to take some of his weight off of my back.
4,very complete,"The stiff little fingers are a great band and this CD is a very complete collection of SLF songs, unfortunatly the SLFs are also very hit and miss most of there songs are really good but some just dont quite do it for me. I was also a little disapointed in the ""barbed wire love"" version they descided to put on this CD. But over all if your a SLFs fan this is a must buy"
4,punk rock,This group of musicians have been around for years. If you like old punk rock this cd is for you. Every song has a message of sorts.
3,Not Bad... Three and a half,"Ok, This wasnt a bad book, and the ending tied in really well with the first two books. Bradley must have had it all worked out ahead of time and that is refreshing to see in the world of fantasy where many people just write to put out another volume...Cough *Robert Jordan... Anyhow my problem with this book is that it was 20 years after Scions Lady and when i bought the book i was assuming TIg would have some adventures in the interim. I dont like books that leap far into the future...some of the majic always gets left behind. If you read the first two books then by all means oyu have to read this one as well to see how Tig (and his son) resovle the issue of the lady pain...3 and a half stars.... definatly worth a read..."
4,Quick and easy!,We use these labels and the matching printer (OL-500) for our small business. These have a little strip of stickerless paper down the side to make the labels easy to pull of the backing.Makes labeling a breeze!
4,"Quality roll, very high price","Doberman makes the same product for half the cost. If you want Brother name, then go for it. It's a great product. If you want to save some money, go to Doberman."
1,traveling garment bag,Quality not apparent. Returned this to amazon for another brand that was very good. This seemed to be a promotional item.
4,NOT CARRYON size,"Great design, but i wish it was a carry on size. I thought it was. So for a check on bag, i dont think its worth the small size."
3,Does it's job,"It is not so fancy, but it does it's job. I wouldn't buy a second one, but for the cheap price it got the job done."
3,Ok for the price,This is okay for the price. Did not hold exactly the amount I thought it would but overall is okay.
5,Product as described,I'd traveled twice in two long flight trips and the luggage still perfect. For the price it's an excellent purchase. Thxs.
5,Awesome garment bag,"Not only is this a garment bag, it can hold a couple days personals and undergarments. I would recommend for anyone who travels to trade symposiums or the like."
1,Terrible.... and the seeler is worse,"awful bag, awful store selling defective merchandise and then tells you there is nothing they can do. I would not recommend this bag to anyone, pieces fall off the 1st time you use it. CSN stores, the retailer for my bag, would not allow me to return and provided little help in contacting the manufacturer for a refund."
4,Buena compra a buen precio!,Esta maleta es una buena compra. Es fácil de manejar y acomodar en los viajes y el precio esta excelente!
1,"Horrible, cheap, do not buy!","Cheap quality, waste of money, do not buy. My bag broke 3 weeks after I purchammsed. Buy a better product, save your money.Many others to buy."
4,Pleasantly Surprised,"I am very happy with my purchase. It arrived in great condition. There were no defects in the bag and it seems very sturdy. I like that there are compartments on the inside of the bag to use all the space it has. I will post pictures. I haven't used it yet, but will this week. I will update my review if I have any problems."
2,NOT carry-on friendly...,"I ordered this hoping for a bag on the smaller side. It's not small, it's quite large. The dimensions are not compatible with most airline carry-on requirements. It also seemed a bit heavy to me. I did return this item for the reasons I mentioned, and found a smaller, lighter bag - though not a garment bag. Another thing about this bag: the clothes will hang upside down (i.e. the top of the garment/hanger will be in the bottom of the bag, so your things might slide down). I was planning to take a skirt suit in this bag, and honestly, my clothes are tiny, and most likely would have slipped down to the bottom in a wrinkled heap. Not a great look for an interview!Check the dimensions of the luggage you intend to order very carefully...Not the greatest item I've ever seen. A disappointment overall."
2,Rolling Garment Bag,"I was disappointed when I first saw it, craftmanship was lacking and I questioned weather or not it would stand up to the airlines abuse. The hanging mechanism is very cheap and we had to tie it to keep it closed while traveling.The good news about it is: when we arrived at our destination the clothes were not wrinkled at all. So for that reason I would give it a 5 stars but quality of product no."
4,Excellent Biography,"This book is not only an excellent biography of a gifted man, but it also contains valuable information about the world in which he lived. Beautiful color illustrations add to the easy readability of this resource. Excellent resource for a wide range of studies."
4,Old Hollywood...,Old Hollywood always is a great story. These types of biographies are very educating.You can see how the business has evolved.
4,I beg to differ,"This is clearly the best cd that Angra has done. It mixes classical elements with powerful and well played metal. I will admit Andre's voice is not the best but I think does a fine job on this cd. He has decent range and is clear. I must have heard this cd over 30 times and strongly endorse it for fans of Rhapsody, Helloween and bands in those veins. Enjoy."
3,Good,"I really don't have any taste for singer Andre Matos' voice, which is pure imitation of singers like Geoff Tate of QUeensryche and has no ""feeling"" at all. But I have to admit the songs on this album are fantastic, the best thing ever done by a Brazilian metal band, and it is the best Angra album."
2,"A band without personality, but great effort in this one.","This is the second greatest Brazilian metal band (after SEPULTURA). Their problem is that they only copy bands like Helloween, Gamma Ray, IRon Maiden and ohter ""Melodic metal"" bands. SInger Andre Matos has the same problems he had in his other Brazilian band, called VIPER: he has incredible vocal reach, but uses it in a boring manner, so in the middle of the album you're already wanting to kill the singer! Anyway, this is the best CD by Angra. But an indication of the band's limitations is the fact that the best song of the album is a cover version of Kate Bush's ""Wutering Heights"" (it got amazing!)"
1,Don't waste your time and money,"I think this must be the worst band in the planet. Yes ,Japan really loves them, but let's face it: Japan likes anything that is told them to like. Andre's voice is very, very weak and has no personality at all. The music is pure cliché. I just can't find the best reason why you should NOT buy this."
5,Must Buy,Unbelievable album. These guys are great. The guitar work is as good as it gets. I have read some criticism of the singing. You won't get it from me. He has awesome range and great power. There are some similarities with Helloween. All the more reason to buy it!
4,Useful Product,"I purchased this product for use with my iPhone. The iPhone fits in this perfectly and nice and snug. It has cushions to protect your phone/device so it does not get scratched. While there is no chance of the iPhone falling out of it, the holder does come detached from the vent. If you hit it wrong while driving, it is easy to knock it out. I do love the convenience and hands free use of my phone that this product affords me. I wish there was a way to stabilize it to prevent it from falling out of the vent but I have yet to come up with a way to do that.Overall, this is a really great product and I don't regret buying it. If you need an easy hands free solution to be able to access your phone while you drive, this is a great product!"
2,Move Along...,"I ordered this after my Vonage provided modem died. Bought this one and it worked fine for a while, then stopped working. It was probably a matter of months. Dissapointed. I dont know if I just got a bad one, but it left a bad taste in my mouth with vonage in general. In my cancellation call, I told them I had been through 2 modems now, and they mailed me one for free. It has been working fine for 6 months now.BTW, I keep all my electronics on UPS so it did not get smokeed by lightning or a surge.Pros:Worked fine while it lastedCons:Quality Control! (Or lack thereof...)"
4,Higher output. Not High output.,"Soundwise somewhere between a Little 59 and a traditional Tele bridge. You lose the ice-picky highs, but you are sacrificing some of the traditional twang here. It's a good choice if you play rock and roll on a tele- particularly if you use a moderate amount of gain."
2,DVD is intentionally crippled,"The show may be good, but this DVD isn't. I bought the DVD but ran into all sorts of problems when I tried to copy it to my home's media center. Apparently Comedy Central thought it would be a good idea to cripple the disc with some sort of copy protection that ends up making it unplayable on many systems (including software DVD players such as VLC). But worse, it makes it very difficult to transfer it to your computer or media center (even though you have the legal right to do so). Their copy protection makes it difficult for us consumers to use the product if they buy the DVD legally, but this show is easy to find on torrent sites because the pirates apparently had no problem circumventing the protection. So ironically that's the best place to find a usable version of this media, not by buying the DVD."
4,"Demitri Martin ""Important Things""","Very clever, fresh and funny. He has a delightful innocence that is refreshing. It's easily digestible since it is divided into 20-minute segments. You can watch one per evening, or two or three segments and then return a few days later to catch a few more."
2,WEAK,"I bought this to complete my collection, I could have done without this one. Weak songs, lyrics, guitar and vocals, buyers beware listen before you buy. Two Hearts is not much better, these I think are his worst the rest of his CD,S are good to great."
3,"Gentle Little Lion: Nice story, bad summary","OK, to start, my internet nickname is StoryMaker. Gentle Little Lion is about a lion who just wants to play with the other animals and dosen't want to learn to hunt. Great story, especially for youngsters who don't like how lions hunt other animals, but the reason why the rating is 3 out of 5 stars is because of the summmary at the title page. It gives away half of the story! Amazon.com desplays this summary (calling it the ""card catalog description"") so if someone goes to this page and reads it, half the plot will be given away! Still, I love the story and the lion facts at the back. Signed, StoryMaker. ""Gotta trust the kid's review!"""
2,"Sexy video , but bad performence","I think this video is really sexy and it shows Madonna's nasty side. However, I would have liked to see more of her in the video and for her to take that stupid blind fold off! And what's with the ""Making of the Sex book"" part? It's tottaly rated ""X""! NOT FOR CHILDREN,MTV BANNED THIS VIDEO FOR EXPLICIT SEXUAL CONTENT!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,You can change something,"Things don't always work out the way you think they're going to, and this book shows you how to take the hand you're given and stop the negative thinking. Less Drama More Fun is a book I'd highly recommend to anyone who gets themselves wigged out over little (and big) setbacks in life. I found the information to be simple, but insightful and the exercises help you discover who you are, where you're going and offers tips on how to get where you want to be. It certainly helped me. Coming from an ex- professional worry wart, the timing of this book couldn't have been better. It certainly helped me through a huge career change. Read it. And then read it again!"
3,Nothing special,"My 8yo got this as a gift. We wouldn't have bought it, because he doesn't even like Scooby Doo, and he probably didn't play it for more than 5 hours - he got bored halfway through. Although it is a fun, harmless adventure for kids, and it has a wonderful Scooby retro feel to it, it just isn't gripping enough to hold interest."
2,"Zoinks! Like, this game is lame, man!","Being a fan of Scooby-Doo since birth, I must say that Mystery Mayhem is probably the worst game based on SD, and in general, one of the WORST games I've ever played in my life! The graphics are horrible even for a PlayStation 2 game released in 2004, Scooby & Shaggy get easily scared, and you have to start the ENTIRE level back from where you left off, especially when you've gotten most of the ghosts or have almost finished off the boss in the level. You can only jump onto locations that are marked, which sucks. In Night of One Hundred Frights, you can jump anywhere you want to. The controls are weak, you have to keep pressing the same buttons over and over and over again, Shaggy is just worthless, and Scooby seems to be the only useful character, because he can crawl through hard to reach places. Why do we even need Shaggy?! Again, he's just completely worthless! Honestly, I liked Night of 100 frights and Cyber chase a lot better. 2/5"
3,"It's not that bad, but not as fun as 100 Frights.....","Mystery Mayhem is not THAT bad, but no it's not as fun as Night of 100 Frights. If you're considering Mystery M. but have not played N.of 100 Frights please start with N. 100 F. first!!! Rent Mystery Mayhem because you can probably finish it during the rental period, unless you have cheats for 100 Frights I doubt you'll be able to rent once & finish.I'm a female in my mid 20 and I'm not a serious gamer, Mystery Mayhem is not all that challenging but finding all the goodies is time consuming enough to keep my interest. If you like the following girly kiddie games then rent don't by Mystery Mayhem: Monopoly, the Mario Parties, Shrek Party, any Mario Nintendo game, Simpson's Hit & Run and Road Rage. Night of 100 Frights is a masterpiece compared to Mystery Mayhem, but M.M. is not that bad."
1,Very Sad,"Night of 100 Frights was really cool -- my 5 year old and I (over 40) had the best time playing over and over and over. Mystery Mayhem, well, it's a mystery ... how/why it ever got made... the graphics are poor, story line/presentation is lame, no excitement, no challenge, even my 5 year old played for about an hour and then looked very sad, dejected, disappointed, and hasn't returned since. (Can I get a refund?) I suggest you go blow spit bubbles before buying this game, it will be more fun. Trust me."
5,BEST OF HANDEL,5 stars BECAUSE this is a great sounding cd. This one of the better sounding albums to here.Here is another rare album worth buying.
1,Company with bad attitude,"After the way Panasonic treated me, after I purchased a lemon, yes, not all their new products work, I wont buy a Panasonic item ever again.Panasonic does not understand customer service. They do not deserve to have customers."
2,No User Program Buttons,We bought this as a backup to our old Quasar which has three one-touch user programmable buttons. This unit has none. This was always the handiest feature. If it is important to you be aware.
5,the Cadillac of my kitchen,"This is my 4th panasonic microwave in the past 30 years and I have to say this one is the cadillac of all microwaves. I'm so impressed with it - appearance, ease of use, perfect cooking every time, etc. I researched the prices of this item all over the internet and Amazon had the best price by far! Thanks Amazon!"
5,"Great Microwave, great price","This is an excellent microwave. Like the other reviewers said, it even defrosts well. As for the green color, it's just the protective ""skin"" put on to keep the stainless steel clean. You can pull it off with no problem."
1,"Reprint of 1913 edition with ""wrong names""-- save your money","Save your pennies for a copy of the 1952 edition (out of print) from a used book dealer. The 1913 edition uses a set of names known as ""American Code"" that botanists haven't used since the 1950's; the services of a professional taxonomist is practically required to update the changes, and few people will know what you're talking about if you use an ""American Code"" name for a plant. The 1952 edition updates all of that, and includes quite a few more species. In my opinion, Dover did a real disservice to botany by reissuing the 1913 edition. Kay Lancaster (plant taxonomist)"
3,Fun tailgate item,"Who doesn't love to hear Fight on State? Giving it 3 stars due to durability, since we have gone through a couple. (Maybe we just use it too much) However, it is such a fun opener that we just keep replacing."
4,Soulful Women Duets of South Texas,I really enjoyed listening to this cd. It captured the true Tajano roots. It is great that someone has paid tribute to these wonderful artists.
3,"Good experience, not great","The camera overall is very good. However, I was told that everything on it was functioning and it wasn't. The camera comes with 2 different memory card slots. One for a SD card and one for a compact flash card. The SD card slot doesn't work which was the type of card I already had. So, I had to go purchase a $25 compact flash card and a $30 card reader for my computer to be able to use it. The camera otherwise takes excellent pictures and works fine. I received the order earlier than told which was nice, but would like to have known the SD card slot was broken."
5,Mini cycling encyclopedia....,"Excellent reference volume for any cyclist. Nearly all aspects of biking including basic set-up, maintenance, physical conditioning,and honing riding skills are dealt with in ""blocks"" consisting of a few pages to full chapters. I find myself checking a section for a few minutes in the ""library"" and then rereading full chapters."
3,Somewhat out of date,"This book is an intro to cycling that would be good to read before you buy your first bike as it has an awful lot of information on bike sizing. The sizing part starts to sound like an infomercial for Zinn's bike shop, so I ended up skipping the end of it to get to the rest of the stuff about workouts, massage, and stretching. Zinn's views on self-massage and stretching are sensible enough, but they're kind of thin. A better bike book would expand this part and shorten the bike sizing message."
3,"A good book, but mistitled","I have no doubt that Zinn knows a lot about bicycles and bicycling, and I have gleaned a useful tip or several from this book. But be alerted to the fact that this is not a primer (defined as a book that deals with the basics of a subject). This is a book for the intermediate cyclist--and probably one who is preparing for serious cycling or competition. Those looking for information for beginners should look elsewhere."
4,Great product,"This product and the related printer are exceptional. I love that they ink is built right into it.*note~ I give the product 5 stars, but ranked it with only 4 since Amazon has some sort of weird limit to how much you can purchase with your account. Amazon... this is crazy, how can you sell someone a printer and than limit selling them the printing tape that goes with it???????"
3,OK but,"This set of labels works, but I found an awful lot of waste in the one-half inch products. Also, their presized labels never seem to be the size I want. I have converted my labels to continuous and then they fit where I want them."
3,About prison,"It wasn't bad, I liked Fox In A Box much better. This is when she first started. She is very sexy indeed."
3,It takes a long time to load,"I bought this game because pinball is one of the only games I can handle to play for any length of time. The game is great but it is not a multiple player game, and it takes a long time for this game to load when switching tables or players"
3,Decent Pinball for the Casual Player,"The average person ( if not pinball purists and fanatics ) will enjoy this title just fine. The graphics are detailed, colorful, and nicely rendered. The physics work well and the sound effects are pretty good. You will have to finagle the angle and the view a bit to get a good look at the table. Overall, the price is right ( wasn't Pacman for the 2600 about $10 more when first released ? ) and will take up good amount of your time.p.s. The girls on the box ( as far as I can tell ) have little or nothing to do with the game and only serve to make the buyer look somewhat lecherous. The original pre-release box was better."
3,It was XBOX,A fine game with plenty of play up until the XBOX was replaced with XBOX 360. Now what use is it?
3,Good Pinball Game,"The game is good, and the price of under $20 makes it worth it. But for any true pinball enthusiast, the reason I give this game the three stars is the fact that each game gives you five balls, not the traditional three. And you can not change the settings to fix this problem.The graphics are good, and the physics are true to life. The five ball rule is really the only things that takes away from this great game. I would not pay more than the $20 asking price."
1,"really bad, but works on 360",This game sucks. It's all ramps and lanes. No drop targets or stand up targets. And the flipper is really weak. you can't even go up a ramp because the flippers are so weak. The graphics are ugly and not clear even when playing in hd on xbox 360. avoid it. maybe worth it for 5 bucks to play once and toss in garbage.
3,One hit album,"This is one of those albums that I ended up buying based off one song and got burned. I heard ""Smells Like Candy"" on Pandora and had to have everything that this band could churn out. I had high hopes that they could produce more stuff just as good. I listened to the song previews and although they didn't sound like ""Smells"", I was swayed by the glowing reviews and comments including the one saying that the previews don't do the songs justice.If you're looking for more songs that sound like ""Smells Like Candy"", you won't find them on this album. Just buy the one track and keep moving. If you like the kind of music you hear in the previews, by all means go ahead and buy this, it's just not my cup of tea. I don't know why they would put ""Smells"" on this album; it sticks out like a sore thumb."
3,Be wary of contact resistance .... HEAT!,"Be wary of lead resistance. The lead (contact) resistance for these fuses is non-trival. When moving more than 50Amps, certain fuse holders get hot an may melt. These fuses generally do NOT have gold plated contacts."
5,Gotta love Columbo,Another video filled with Columbo episodes. I love them all. This came in great condition and was delivered quickly.
3,Somewhat disappointing,"All but one of the movies worked on my dvd players. I have fairly new players and took a gamble on buying this despite the comments which warned it didn't work properly in the USA. Still, I would rather have it than not, so I am not going to return it."
3,The movie versions of Columbo,"As much as I love watching Columbo annoy everyone as he solves a crime, the movie versions, at least to me, are not nearly as entertaining as the regular episodes. I may not be able to fully describe the differences, but the movie versions just don't have what the epsiodes have and can be drawn out and boring, especially in the beginnings. Personally, I like the episode versions of Columbo much better than the movies. I will collect all the seasons of Columbo before I buy any more movie collections."
3,columbo lovers,These are not in widescreen!!the 1991 and later releases are in ws format. much better they fill up the entire screen.
5,TV mystery drama at its best,"Over the years there have been many fairly entertaining series on TV, many of which are now available on DVD. But, as one looks back, it is clear that only a few TV series went beyond being fairly entertaining and stood out sharply from the crowd as being both unique in concept and very well done. One such series was Columbo, which definitely was unique in concept and went beyond very well done to excellent. Peter Falk was superb as Columbo and deserved the Emmy awards he received for this role. But each episode was also very well written and directed and the guest stars were consistently outstanding. Quite simply, Columbo was TV drama at its best. I heartily recommend this DVD."
4,Any word on more Columbo DVD's?,I'm addicted to Columbo DVD's - any word on the next batch? I'm assuming they'd be 1990 TV movies - it's been a while since the '89 set - and they were coming out left and right before that. I'd like to know! Thanks in advance for any info.
3,COLUMBO DVD WATCHING,"i hate to have to give this columbo (mystery movie collection, 1989) dvd a 3 star, but i have to admit i was a bit disappointed on this one. i am a huge fan of columbo and love watching my dvd's every nite and alway to find something i missed from watching it the time before, but i don't know, these columbos were boring to me...i have had no trouble with the dvds at all and i have been lucky with my other ones too. amazon always comes thru with the best quality...""just one more thing"" i will of course always be the first one in line to get the new dvd to come out of my COLUMBO!!"
3,SUB STANDARD MATERIAL,"COLUMBO GOES TO THE GUILLOTINE is good, mainly because of magic-ESP. (Would you stick your head in that contraption?) The other four installments are weak. There is not much preplanning or execution by the killer. In 1989, the producers got too artistic, instead of sticking to the standard format. There are scenes that should have been cut. The viewers will never see most of these on TV reruns.(But the show gets better later in the years.) If you're a fan, you will want these. If not, start with season 1, and work your way forward. There is no Mrs Columbo, which I liked. Instead, they have a feature called: AMERICA'S TOP SLEUTHS. Interesting that six of the top ten are from Universal. I like two shows: Rockford and Columbo. Hawaii Five-0, Dragnet, and Kojack are missing. Looks like the list is rigged. Oh, I forgot to mention that there are no known stars in this bunch (of Columbo). Nothing like the high quality of the earlier, or later programs."
2,Where is it?,Estimated arrival time was June 13th. It's now June 26. It's always been kinda slow when it comes to DVD's. Gettin a little worried.
2,bad series,"I'm glad i didn't buy this. no matter how he tries, is far away from original seasons (wich is my favorite movie), is older, is moving slower, talk slower, modern music in movies, not talking about uninspired stories.The movie with Guillotine, OMG what a shame at the end, Columbo takes a gun with a flag and sais that is very very happy to arrest him, the killer. Columbo is never happy about that.Neither other actors are better.Disapointed per total, i saw series 8 and 9, this dvd contains 8 and one movie from 9."
1,Confused,"Last week Amazon said this was a region two dvd, so I opted not to buy something that I can't play in my dvd player. This week, they claim it a region one dvd. Some of the reviewers says it works, and some say it doesn't. I don't want waste my money on a product that I can't play in my machine. Can some thoughtful person at Amazon, please clear up this confusion once and for all. I hestiate to buy it this week and then next week the information is changedonce again to read region two dvd."
5,#1 COLUMBO FAN,"I am a fan of any and every columbo episode. If your a columbo fan like me you must complete your video libraryColumbo - Mystery Movie Collection, 1989Columbo - The Complete Fifth SeasonColumbo - The Complete Sixth and Seventh Seasonsoh ""JUST ONE MORE QUESTION"""
1,Very dissapointed,I have been a Columbo fan since the 70's. I have watched those movies over and over and over because they are that good.I bought the 1989 collection and was very disappointed in the series. The acting is horrible by ALL actors and the story lines are terrible. The plots are even worse.As much as I hate to dis the Columbo movies... do yourself a favor and save your money.
4,Columbo 1989,"Sound and picture ok on my set.All pretty good. MURDER, A SELF PORTRAIT, a little strange; Wife, ex-wife and lover, co-mingling?C.W.C."
5,Wonderful,"This is a poignant and moving book. It is well constructed. It addresses the daily activities, as well as the overall significance, of women on the Oregon Trail. The book weaves together (and is centered around) excerpts from diaries and other first hand writings. Hearing the stories from those who experienced the journey was an emotional and educational treat."
4,Interesting women's history,"If you are interested in the day to day lives of women as they walked the Oregon Trail, you'll enjoy this book."
1,Very poor image quality,The transfer used for this disc is of very poor quality and not representative of the quality of the photography of this film. It's not worthy of a Blu Ray release since it's even below good DVD quality. Calling it HD is misleading. There is no HD detail there nor the proper look and texture of 35mm film.
1,electrical connection only works sometimes,"Now I have to buy a whole new kit because I don't want to deal with Audiovox to get this one fixed and I don't want to have to buy a whole new receiver and kit for the car. Oh well. They're going to get another 50 of my dollars. Sirius does rock, though."
3,Antenna is worthless,Dont bother purchasing this unless you plan on replacing the antenna. I live on a 3rd story apartment building luckily facing east where there is a bunch of trees. I get spotty reception that drives be insane. So I bought the Terk SIR6 Outdoor Home Antenna (which you can find here too) and I'm hoping it will improve the reception
1,I stopped using these products.,I used this shampoo and conditioner for 2 months and I finally decided to stop using them. This product may work for some people but definitely not for me. I didn't see any result at all. I felt I was losing hair more than when I used other products.
3,"Great music, weak vocals","One thing is clear: Angra writes great songs. Their implementation of symphonic instruments is beautiful and it works with their hard metal edge in wonderful ways. Unfortunately, the whiny vocalist lacks the power to match the music. Still, I think this album is worth getting. Carolina IV is an incredible song, and it alone almost justifies buying the album, but there's a lot of other good material hear too."
3,"A step up, still plagued with bad production quality","I think the songs on Holy Land are probably better than they sound. Perhaps one day the band will re-record this with the production quality of their more recent albums (plus they could have Edu sing them).The songs here are better composed than on their previous album. Silence and Distance, Carolina IV, Holy Land, Z.I.T.O., and the Queen-sounding Deep Blue are all excellent examples of the kind of music the band is capable of. Plus, you have loads of classical and cultural themes embedded in the prog-metal. It's quite original.I give the album 7.0/10, or 3 stars. Again, the detractors for the album are poor production quality, and a nasal vocalist."
1,ARGHHH!,"I will not say that AMAZON should have the zero-star rating, because zero is too much for this band. Technically the boys are okay, but it seems it's all they care about. Poor songwriting, lack of personality ( 1000 bands sound like this ) and a thin, ugly voice on top of that. Believe you me, stay away!"
1,Antiquated,"I was so looking forward to reading ""How to be an Assertive (Not Aggressive..."" However, as I started the book I felt I was back in the 70's. Women have come along way, and yes, we still have a long way to go if we choose to be ""accepted"" into a ""mans world"". This book is out dated."
4,"what, old-fashioned twang music from the Rust Belt?","You better believe it ... this group of Clevelanders have found the original soul of country and western music, and are breathing life into it their own way. The group are all musically talented, and these songs come off very tight and well-done. I'll only give them four stars though, because as good as this album is, it doesn't hold a candle to their live performances."
4,I Loved this Group And Their Songs!,"What I liked special about this group was that they are so ""Down to Earth"". Hillbilly Idol isn't like other country/folk groups. They are so natural. Believe me, I've met them. In fact, I took fiddle lessons from one of them."
4,Lots of hard work put together,"Although this might not be the most comprehensive language reference I've ever read, it adds new views and ingredients for my lesson plans.Recommended to people who are serious about English and its usage. A sure library item for writing teachers."
4,One of the top Blaxploitation flicks,"Whenever I tell people (who haven't seen it) that Blacula is one of my favorite guilty pleasures, they inevitably laugh, and I find myself defending it. People who've seen it usually don't laugh. True, it's not a horror classic on the level of Bride of Frankenstein, but it's not meant to be. What it does have is a literate script, solid acting (esp. William Marshall's commanding performance), a great score, and some fun shocks. It's not just the best of the Blaxploitation horror films, it may be the best Blaxploitation film period."
4,Superior! Great film--,"Gary, Ind. born William Marshall adds real pathos to the perennial movie villain of the vampire-- dumbed down and familar ever since Bela Lugosi, Marshall made him aristocratic on a level comparable to Christopher Lee's Dracula in the Hammer Films.. There is much political allegory to be seen in this film, as the black monarch is attacked and 'enslaved' by European vampire-colonialism, and subsequently, becomes as obsessed with blood-lust as they are-- feeding on his own people and perpetuating a bizarre form of genocide-- much to the chagrin of his contemporaries in Watts. Mamuwalde is aware of what he has become, and hates it-- but, seemingly, can do nothing about it-- is the curse of racism, essentially, too great to overcome?"
3,very cheesy movie but quite entertaining,"I bought the movie blacula because it would be a classic thing to have, but the first time i saw it was when it was listed under HORROR in the video store. This movie turns more into a comedy in my point of view just because of the funky music in the background and the cheesy special effects. I enjoyed it though because the name BLACULA itself brought a smile to my face. Buy it if you want something to add to your collection of corny movies."
3,kinda funky,I bought this movie because i am a fan of Blacksploitation movies and if u like thses u will love this. With it's funky music and costumes.
3,Has anyone but me noticed...,"There is a scene in this great movie that I have never heard or read any comments about. I can't possibly be the only person who's noticed. It's the scene directly after the opening credits and the discovery of the coffin, where the box is lifted by a crane and deposited in the back of a pickup truck: this scene is lifted directly from the opening of the movie 'Count Yorga, Vampire', from the previous year!"
1,Alright Then...,"This is quite a...bizarre...movie. I thought it would be some sort of a comedy or maybe a black comedy or maybe even a horror black comedy. It's not really any ot these. I think it's supposed to be a horror, but the story's so old and the plot in this movie is so predictible it's not scary. I don't think it was supposed to be a comedy, but I found humor in how fake it looked when Blacula transformed into a bat. I have to admit, they could have made a great whack-ass comedy type parody out of this, but they tried to take it seriously and got...this. I think someone like Marlon or Damon Wayans should remake this and make it intentionally funny. But seriously, this is a baaaad movie. Stay away."
1,Blacula Sucks,"This was made in the height of the weak genre 'blaxploitation', it is one of the worse films ever put into frame. If you like horror movies you will certainly not like this one, it was even followed up by a sequel which was twice as bad. Avoid it and check out Roger Corman's stuff better, no need to look at 8 foot afros!"
4,Flashback 1970's Scary Fun,"I use to watch this late nites on channel 5 or 9, great scary fun. I am happy to see it fully restored by MGM the DVD has only the original Trailer and it would have been nice if they had added some extras as Anchor Bay does with most of the great horror titles they distribute. William Marshall who later made apperances in Pee Wee's playhouse is what makes this movie stand out. Fun twist on the Dracula theme with an almost all black cast and lotsa 70's themes. This movie is no spoof,but a scary action packed horror film which has humor in all the right places. The sequel tho is not as good. I also recomend The Return of Count Yorga which is on VHS only i think, as another 70's scary fun film. Worth buying and adding to your Horror collection."
1,I'm curious?,"How come Kevin has gray hair on the cover of this book, but in his later book he has dark hair? Did he discover a cure for graying hair too! The man's a genius! (Pun intended)."
1,Waste of time and money!!,This book wasn't what was expected. Author repeats self in an effort to put down words. This was a total waste of time and money.Most of the information is commom sense issues and can be found else where at no cost.
5,Great book,I have read Kevin Trudeau's first book which was great and I feel this one is even better. I highly recommend this book. After I was diagnosed with diabetes and on medication for 5 months I read Kevin Trudeau's first book and decided to see a naturopath. Come to find out I had a Vitamin D deficiency and after 4 days on a Vitamin D3 supplement I no longer needed the medication and to this day I am no longer diabetic. There are also other things in his book I have tried and have found very effective.
1,More Natural Cures Revealed: Previously Censored Brand Name Products That Cure Disease,A waiste of money - Don't bother
1,Total Conman and NO Credibility,"Just for the record, I have a strong science background, a medical doctorate with long-term experience, and finishing an MBA. . .This guy's a total phony . . . just promoting himself and some really loose, if not dangerous, mass-hysteria misbeliefs. He started off as a scammer, and he's still at it . . . just this time he's legally taking -- no, you're GIVING him -- your hard-earned money from your pocket through the use of a PR team who knows how to promote UTTER garbage. It would be nice if you could just hand the PR people your money, because they at least deserve it for a job well done. I can EASILY pull apart just about everything in this book."
3,Book review,"I am excited to have the book More Natural ""Cures"" Revealed, however I did find that I could have gotten the book at a much cheaper rate by ordering it from television. I order many things from Amazon.com and I am always pleased with their service."
1,Not Worth it.,"I've read several of his self help books at the area library, this is another that I'm glad I never purchased. He should write about how to hoodwink the general public, that is an area he knows well. Don't waste your money on this book look further to the works of accomplished Doctors and Nutritionists."
3,Interesting read,Not a whole lot of WOW factor... Many alternative treatment options for many conditions. I'm just not sure how much research and evidence based information is really provided in this book.
1,Trudeau Rips Us Off Again,Kevin Trudeau is up to his old tricks again. All his previous books failed to deliver on his promise to reveal natural cures. This one will be no different. Don't buy his books.JRM
1,If your're looking for a list of brand name products that cure disease,then you'll be better off using Google.Trudeau writes to eat whole real foods because the food companies put additives that are addicting in food that are not whole. I believe that but where is the list of the brand names that cure?
1,DO YOU LIKE SCARY GARBAGE ON YOUR BOOKSHELF?,"Then buy this book! If this book is so great, and his other one, then why can't we view the table of contents, or a sample page via Amazon? Apparantly this book is so full of crap that the publisher has not enabled this feature, cause they probably don't want you to see what's in it, until you've paid your money for it! Just read through a few reviews on Amazon, you'll get the real picture. Apparantly, even the marketing group has been busy doing damage control on Amazon. It's simply amazing and sad, how easily people let themselves be conned."
1,More Natural Cures,"I bought one of Kevin's books, ""Natural cures that they don't want you to know about"". I read the whole book and it did not contain ONE cure of any kind. I think he is a con artist and should be arrested. I sent the book back to the company I bought it from and they gave me credit for it. The public should not have to put up with a jerk like Kevin.."
1,"Lotsa hype, no valuable content","I was looking for a holistic approach to healing. Hoped to find home remedies, alternatives to pharmaceuticals. Not in this book!"
5,Good Reading,"Trudeau continues with his last book. Again, he repeats himself quite a bit, but his points need to be repeated. Good reading..."
2,Save Your Money...,"The book wasn't clear, concise, or to the point regarding debt--not even close! It was repetitious and quite boring to be quite honest. Having the audio format, had I heard the phrase ""it's a scam"", one more time, I would have flung the disc out of the window, instead...I returned it for refund--I couldn't take it any more! Remember--timely delivery, straight forward, and a less whiney approach in conveying a message,Debt Cures ""They"" Don't Want You to Know Aboutis what it's all about!"
1,Biggest Con artist in the USA,"This guy will sell you his mother if you'd pay him. There was a 20/20 a few months back that he is a scam artist. He use to false advertise on those home shopping network shows and made big bucks...so big the government fined him & took away 2 of his houses. He sells lies as a book now because there is no law against it. His comments can be considered an opinion and nothing can be done to stop him. Check out the 20/20 Exclusive, he's no further from a killer because people die when they listen to him and stop taking life sustaining medications."
1,This man is a fraud,"Were I able to give a book zero stars, I would. Aside from the fact that the book contains no natural cures (Heres a hint why: There arenent any) but its just a big shill for you to buy Kevins website subscription all the while bashing REAL medicine that actual helps people.Look up his history, you will see he has been in trouble MANY times because of the lies he tells. He is not on your side, he is on his wallets side."
2,incomplete,Kevin seems to give a lot of incomplete information that you can only get the rest of the story by paying to access his webb site
5,Pretty good!,I drive an hour to work and an hour home and this kept me sane.. scared but sane!He really informs you about a ton of things you may not know.I've changed quite a few things and re-think about a few things before I do them (if they are un-avoidable)Worth listening too if you don't have time to read the book!
2,A big disappointment,"Kevin Trudeau leads his readers into believing they will get the solutions they are looking for but when the time for presenting them comes, he sends his readers to his website where they have to pay an outrageous membership fee. He condemns those who are out to make money at our expense then turns around does the same thing. I give it two stars because there is some knowledge to be gained but no solution unless you are willing to pay. A big disappointment."
1,Scam Artist,"Please be careful when using his suggestions. I have a friend that died, because she thought he was the real deal and did everything he suggested. Please be careful. Anyone wanting to know more about him, Google him. You might be surprised to learn what he is really about."
1,I Would Rather Circumcise My Eyeballs Than Continue Reading Any More of Convict Kevin Trudeau's Ignorant Medical Advice,"Kevin Trudeau's latest collection of medical ignorance and grammatical flaws is an insult to the literate, human mind.Trudeau knows more about bending over to pick up the soap in a maximum security prison, than he does about medicine, physiology, and how to compose a paragraph in English.Instead of purchasing Trudeau's silly book to cure your ills, save your $30.00 for the co-pay to visit your family doctor."
1,More Natural Cures Revealed: Previously Censored Brand Name Products That Cure Disease,Nothing new! Same old complaining about the Gov. and the Pharm. Industries. Waste of money - like the first book he wrote
2,Natural Cures Revealed,"I have only read about half of the book so far. The reason is: that the book tends to put me to sleep. I only read about 4 pages and my eyes start getting heavy, then I am gone. I would like to read the rest of the book but, will later this year when I have more time. I don't really agree with what he has to say, 100%. He states that what is written in the book is his opinion and I beleive that to be true. I have a limited medical background so I find some of the things, he says, to be questionable."
3,"ordered it by phone, they tried to sell me magazines, etc,",They took up 15- 20 min of time of hard selling for a book I could have gotten on Amazon or store. It was 11 days ago and still don't have it. I won't try to order anything on those infomerecials again. I have the first book and liked it. Janice
1,Don't bother!,"I bought this book and thought maybe it had some tips on natural cures that could cure disease. What a joke. I sent it back. When I started reading about how I should only eat Kosher products and not use air conditioning I decided right then and there to send it back. I thought this book might give some useful tips. Not just stupid ""the world is out to kill you"" ideas. Pass on this one! It is not worth the money."
1,He knows every (dirty) trick in the book! What a RIP OFF artist.,"I ordered his ""FREE"" books on TV. I only had to pay (INFLATED) shipping costs. It was to be a present and should have arrived in 4 to 6 weeks. However, 2 months later I called and found the order had NOT been shipped. The gal told me they could not cancel an order but she would rush the books to me. It didn't matter that the event I needed them for was past and I no longer wanted the items. They wanted their ""Shipping"" money. Now if I do not keep the mis-directed package. Not only will I receive NO refund (I only paid an exorbitant amount on shipping), but I will also have to ship back the books at my own expense! IF you decide to buy this book, buy it used from a seller on Amazon or borrow it from the library and DO NOT bend over for Kevin Trudeau!"
2,People Don't Get It,"Trudeau's ramblings continue in this book, and in his soon to be released diet cure book. The man is just a business man who makes a buck by enticing people to find ""miracles."" As one reader suggests, you wade through pages and pages looking for ""tidbits"" that will help make you well. The ""You"" books don't do it either, but they're backed by Oprah. Trudeau pumps money into infomercials, and is still in the top 200 on Amazon. Check out the smaller press books, or books like ""Prescription for Nutritional Healing,"" ""Forget the Cures, Find the Cause,""(An obvious blast at Trudeau, but wonderfully written.) Stop feeding this guy bucks just because he knows how to ""scare"" you into buying a book that may reveal something you think you don't know."
4,good stuff,"This is a real eye-opening book. I have read some of his book referrals, and he isn't just blowing hot air. These doctors really do state of alot of what he says in this book. Just wish he would have given credit where credit is due in regards to speaking positive. This started out as a bibilical principle. I don't think he should take credit for that. But overall, I recommend this book"
2,an incomplete promo for premium products,"While ths is at times a provocative and intriguing book it does not deliver on specifics (regarding its miracle cancer/ heart-disease cures etc) and degenerates in its final chapters to questionable bromides (for example ""do not eat after six pm"", ""don't read the newspaper"", ""breathe"") and references his web-sites that offer premium health care products."
4,more nautral cures,"Well I have both of kevins books and though he may seem to add ""spice"" to his books I beleive the overall outcome of the books are worth buying.what he does say about medical dr's and all that goes along with it, is quite accureate. I was a pharmacy tech and know exactly how medications are killing people. Anyway with an open mind should read these books if you are willing to put some of the things into practice.Yes the alien thing kinda threw me, since I dont believe in them but I think he adds some things in there like that to spice it up. Everything he says about the fda, and other organizations are true. The fda is not out to protect you, you learn alot working in a hospital.Every one should know what they are doing to our foods that we buy. Buy organic or grown your own, I do.Overall books are recommeded- you can get the, for less than .50 off amazon give em a try"
3,Kevin Trudeau Cured My Acne!,"I know many people say Kevin Trudeau is full of it, and I also think he slightly is. However, the man makes good points. There is usefull info to be had from his book. You just have to look extremely hard for it.I used to have moderatly bad acne-nothing seemed to help it, not clearasil, Proactiv, retin a, hormonal therapy-nothing! I thumbed through Kevin's book at Sam's club( I never actually even purchased this book)and looked up acne-one of the ""cures"" listed was evening primrose oil. It can be purchased at any store that sells vitamins. Within a week, I saw major improvement, and a month later I was blemish free!!!! And the evening primrose oil helped my bad PMS to boot!!! My skin has been clear for a long time now.Call him a quack if you will, but the man has changed my life!!"
4,Trudeau's second book gives more insight,"of the food and drug industry. After only following a few of Trudeau's guidelines, I feel much better. I believe my cancer will not recur. I also lost about 10 pounds without really trying."
1,More Natural Cures Revealed: Previously Censored Brand Name Products That Cure Disease,"I did not receive the book as it was returned by DHL although I received the other book that was in my original order. Please resend and ensure that my telephon 671-653-3416 and my locaction address where Postal delivery is not available is provided to DHL at 454 Ch. Pale Ramon Haya; Yigo, Guam 96929."
1,"Con-artist, sleaze bag","This convict has been preying on ignorant people for years. Talk to your doctor, your local health store, ANYBODY - but don't waste your time with this snake oil salesman."
1,More of Kevin Trudeau's Natural Cure Cons,Trudeau knows more about bending over to pick up the soap in a federal penitentiary than he does about the medical field.
1,The $30 Cost of This Book Would Be Better Spent on Your Family Doctor's Co-Pay,"More refuse in book form from the uneducated, felony convicted, infomerical king, Kevin Trudeau."
2,Such a Disappointment,"I was looking for a cure for a chronic condition that Trudeau specifically advertised that there was a cure for. Instead of giving specific information about natural cures for various conditions, the book goes on and on AND ON about his battles with Western Medicine, the Big Pharma and the Federal Government. While I think much of this may be true, I bought this book for the natural cures, not for his life story!The book referred me to his website, where you have to buy a membership to get information about the cures. It offers a free trial, but you have to give them a credit card number and then cancel in 7 days. It also referred me to other resources where I could buy MORE BOOKS to get the information I was looking for. What a waste!"
1,Do your homework b4 you buy,"I was going to by this book through the info commercials that he has as it advertised free shipping. So I called the number.As usual, with the free shipping they had add ons for additional books, which is understandableBut, when I told her all I wanted was the book and the free shipping, she told me that it would take 4 to 6 weeks to receive my book unless I paid extra for the express delivery fee. I explained to her that, in this time and age to receive something after 4-6 weeks have gone by is just a rip off and I cancelled the orderAfter doing a bit of homework after that situation I saw a recommendation for Mikhail Tombak books and I bought them and they are great reading for someone that is proactive in their health care......and he is an actual biologist"
3,Too much conspiracy,"I feel this book certainly pointed me in the right direction concerning my health and what I can do for it on a smaller, personal scale. It is an eye opener, it makes very good, factual points about health issues we are currently facing in America. However, I think most people buy this book because they want to improve their health--not because the want to read the correspondence between Kevin Trudeau and the FDA. The constant mention of government conspiracies [FDA, FTC] towards deteriorating public health, was merely used to fill up the book, was overly emphasized, and it is mostly a personal grudge. It gave it a rather unnecessary conspiracy theory book feel in my opinion."
2,sales pitch,"This book has some good information, but on most subjects, you get just enough information to whet your appetite. If you want more, you have to subscribe to the website. This book isn't much more than a 358 page sales pitch for the ""natural cures"" website."
1,Don't bother with this book.,"Maybe there is some effective health tip in this book. I wouldn't know. I've tried to read it. I've flipped through it. If I open to any random page, it's a page on which he is ranting about the government/drug companies/whoever being evil and how persecuted he is. Apparently, he thinks crying out about the government being out to get him makes him more credible.The tone is dreadful. There's too little information, and too much raving.I would rather have given it NO stars."
2,needs serious editing,"As a professional journalist and author of three books, I was shocked at the lack of editing in Trudeau's book. The first five chapters of this book basically said the same thing (over and over). He made his point in chapter one but kept repeating himself in the next five chapters. I stopped reading after chapter five. Also he kept plugging his earlier book Natural Cures ""They"" Don't Want You to Know About. Many times he wrote the following: ""If you have not read this book [his first book] I strongly suggest that you read it cover to cover.""If he could take his anti-pharmaceutical message and cut out the self-promotion and constant repetition, then it might have been a decent read. As it is, I have to give it 2 stars."
2,A Mostly Nonsensical Book,"I picked this up at a thrift store for ten cents--by page 58 or so, I knew my money was wasted. It's one thing to promote natural medicine; quite another to do so with little or no factual back-up--just self-grandiosing. This man writes at a sixth grade level, constantly repeating himself with vague, convoluted sentences. It is people like Mr. Trudeau who give alternative medicine a bad name. What a shame since there are many health ideas and lifestyles mentioned in the book that actually have merit."
1,Stop the Insanity - This guy should be in Jail (again!),"I unfortunately bought this book and read it- what a crock! I immediately returned it (after a huge runaround by the CS dept) and they tried to sell me on the website. After I told them no they gave me a ""free"" membership which I could use to look at it for a year. I looked at it a year later and there was nothing of any use on it - no ""cures"" no effective treatments or anything of value. This guy is a con artist and it makes me crazy that he's still allowed on TV and is still allowed to sell books and make money with his bogus ""cures & treatments"". I think that anyone who tried them and had something work is probably the result of positive thinking more than his suggestion.He is a felon and a liar. I can't believe that people are still willing to give him their hard-earned money. DO THE RESEARCH BEFORE YOU BUY! Listen to the nay-sayers here - they are telling the truth."
1,Nonsense,"This is a collection of every spurious potion, notion and promotion ever known to mankind presented with particular hotility to commone sense and science."
1,Dont waste your money,Before you purchse this book check this gentleman out firstOur health is too priceless to be putting up with this fellas nonsense
2,"Love it, but it broke after 3 weeks","I love, love, love this device, but it stopped working after 3 weeks. That said, I am returning it and buying a new one. I will post how the new one goes, I'm hoping I just got a lemon."
5,this is great!,"We have Bob for over 3 months now and we are totally satisfied with it. Our boys learned to manage their tv/video time judiciously and when the time is up, there's no arguments AND they start doing other things together -- like play in the backyard! We love it. Only regret? Not finding this product sooner."
1,Does not work with Teens on new TVs,New TVs comes with a power cord which can be removed and replaced. So how do you control if you Teen bypower cord by replacing the TV power cord. Good for TVs with a fixed power cord.
1,Do not buy this product,"We bought this a few months ago. It worked beautifully and allowed us to control our children's tv and wii time. Then, it just stopped working. Tried the reset button and everything else we could think of. Emailed the company. 2 weeks later and no response. Called the company - the number is disconnected. Save yourself the $60 loss and find a comparable product with a better company."
3,Locked compartment can be pried open...,"Today, our 9-year-old discovered he can pry the locked compartment open and bypass BOB pretty easily. The cover and its tabs are not broken, and after turning the lock it can be replaced and relocked, but for us at least, what's the point?Otherwise, and before today, the BOB managed XBox/Wii time really well for us and we were totally satisfied. We would gladly buy a newer model if they can make the plug compartment more secure. You may be satisfied if your child is not both mechanically inclined and dedicated to defeating the device."
4,Works Good,"The TV Bob works good. We just wish you could program each individual day. We give more time on weekends, so we have to add time on weekends to make it work for us."
5,BOB - Screen Time Manager,We did not find it difficult to attach a heavy cord as some have suggested. These units are performing exactly as described.Definitely worth the $.
4,Good tool for monitoring time on tv or computer,We own two bobs and use one on the TV and the other on our computer monitor. Easy to use. One broke before the warranty was up. We had to be very persistant with the company to get a replacement. This would be our only complaint.
1,Any tween or teen can crack this one.,"I bought Bob, and I thought it was working fine. But my thirteen-year-old son had simply unscrewed it and pried it a little. (Maybe he was twelve when he did it; who knows how long Bob had been compromised?) He made Bob look like it was working, but he was taking the plug out of the back whenever he wanted to.My kid has no great talent when it comes to taking things apart. This product allowed him to use the TV for quite a while without my knowledge. I threw the thing away."
3,"Not bad, but could use improvements","I like this product for the most part; however, when the power goes out, you have to reset the time. This is a pain if you have multiple BOBs in your home. Also, I wish there was a way to quickly add time for time earned. This device lets you setup a daily or weekly time allowance. Not so good for adding time on the fly based on earning it.Another negative is if you have guests, you have to provide them with a PIN in order to watch your TV. That is not real convenient. I don't know any way around this.Like I said, overall a good product, but could use some improvements. Like a place for a battery backup for when the power goes out and the ability to add earned time on the fly.Donna"
5,!!!!!Finally!!!!!!,Bob is great!! I have been waiting for a product like this. it is easy to use and it gets the job done! we now have no more fighting over tv time. I bought three. you can tell how good a company is by how they handle the problems. One of my bob's had a l.c.d. screen malfunction. They immediatly sent a new one and a shipping lable to return the old one. I was so impressed with this system because this way I was not stuck for a week without a unit. Their customer service is the best I have ever seen!! A sincere thank you to the inventors of Bob.
3,bob review: setting revision,"Bob was fairly easy to set up with one of two flat screen tvs...both Samsung, one plasma and the other LCD. With the LCD TV, Bob would spontaneously shut off the TV. After futzing around with this for an hour or so, I called the manufacturer and they stepped me through changing one of the settings. Bob worked fine after that but I have to remember to push the ""off"" button three times to turn off the device and the timer.....Obviously, something special to remember just for this TV but not a show stopper. The manufacturer also mentioned that this fix can only be done for the 'newer', 'made in china', Bobs vs older, 'made in the USA devices'. If one has the 'made in USA' devices and one experiences the above anomaly, the manufacturer will switch them out free of charge to a newer device...."
2,Stef Willen is mentally ill so it's no stretch,"The actress, Stef Willen, suffers from Antisocial Personality disorder and pathological lying. I haven't seen this because of revulsion. It is hard to imagine that such a sick woman can produce any work of value. Her huge shoulders and crazed bug eyes don't help credibility. I see a bleak future for her."
3,Not for heavy chewers,"This is a very cute toy and my dog instantly took to it, however, it didn't last 24 hours with my 10 month golden retriever. She had the legs torn off and the stuffing and sqeakers out within a day. She loves to chew and the fabric isn't strong enough for a heavy chewer. I also bought the intellibone plush toy and she hasn't destroyed that yet, I think because the fabric is more durable. Puzzle Pup is a great toy for the dog who doesn't like to take things apart!!"
4,A doggone good time,"My 55(ish) pound mutt, Lulu, likes this toy when I play with it with her, but she's not very interested in playing with it by herself. I guess that's ok, because Lulu's version of ""playing by herself"" mostly involves the systematic destruction of a toy!I like ""interactive"" toys (though any toy, even a sock, can be interactive). Lulu enjoys pulling the rings off while I hold on to one end of the center piece. My husband and I enjoy putting the rings on Lulu's legs and watching her kick them off! (I think she likes it, too, since she waits patiently while we put them on.)However, Lulu doesn't get nearly as psyched about the Puzzle Pup as she does aboutKyjen PP01056 Hide-A-Squirrel Pet Toy, Large. That one's the bomb."
5,5 ARF'S,We have 3 dogs and they all love this toy. It's great because it is actually several toys in one. The pup's love taking it apart but they each have a favorite section that they like to chew on.Not for strong chewers but overall one of the best toys ever.
4,Great rainy day toy,"I have two pups, One is a little over a year and the other is only 5 months. Lily the one year old is very smart and gets board very easily. Meeka isn't quite as smart but quickly learns from her big sister. So I have a stash of toys that I only bring out on days that they are looking a little extra board or when it's too rainy to play out side. This was a perfect addition to our rainy day collection. They have a blast playing with this toy! Its actually very entertaining for me as well. They love to take the rings off one by one and then fight over it for a bit then go for the next ring. I love this toy for my girls, but they are not hard on their toys. So if you have a dog who destroys stuffed toys I definitely woud not recommend this. The girls tug on the rings and squeak them and so far there is no tearing, but I can see it becoming a problem in the future."
4,Will never listen to regular radio again,"Sirius Satallite Radio is probably one of the best purchases I've made in years. This has something for everyone..even truck drivers. What I like about it is the commercial free, uncensored music and of course Howard Stern.the reciever gets warm, which I thought was a bit weird. Other than that I had no problem with it. The reception however, is horrible and drove me absolutly nuts. dont bother purchasing Sirius without an antenna. I purchased the Terk SIR6 Outdoor Home Antenna and I'll update it on how it improvedUPDATE: Reception is horrible where I live...even with the new antenna...if you live in an area with trees, and you have no roof access, dont bother getting sirius satallite radio. Pisses me off that I didnt do the homework that I should have before I bought all of this"
1,Don't EVER buy an Audiovox Product,"This is one of the worst electronic buys I have ever made. The product never worked right from the beginning. I had to jump through hoop after hoop to get it repaired. On top of that, the people at Audiovox have the worst customer service. Everyone was rude and did not seem even the least interested in helping me. They have no desire to serve the customer."
4,Interesting read but not factually accurate,"Once again Larry McMurtry spins a tale of the Wild West. The characters in Buffalo Girls are well-illustrated, with interesting character sketches about their appearances, thoughts, foibles, and quirks. The story is poignant, describing the adventures of a rag-tag bunch of the last of dying breed: those who settled the West. There is a sense of sadness about this book, which reflects the characters' own melancholy. I felt that McMurtry used his creative license well, especially in the ""letters to Jane"" approach, but towards the end of the story the historical bent is completely off-track. While much of Calamity's life is lost to history, it is known that she married and did have a daughter. This is completely ignored in the book. I will give him credit, though--McMurty knows how to end a story! Worthy of your time and consideration, especially if it leads you to read the excellent Lonesome Dove."
5,if you love stories about the old west and it characters,"You will love this one by McMurtry ... he captures, as only he can. the humor and ultimately, the sadness of a disappearing life and the people that helped to shape this part of America"
2,eh,"I'm honestly very surprised by how many people enjoyed this book. I enjoyed the beginning and even part of the middle but the book just kept going for too long. It was rambling, and not in a good way, and barely seemed to have a point. The ending was just weird, though I had an inkling as to what it would be. (But then I had never heard of the rumors that the ending is apparently based on so perhaps that's why I found it weird.) I think that you could find a far better book about the same people if you just want to read a story about Calamity Jane, Buffalo Bill, and others."
2,Poor Condition,"This book was described as being in ""good condition"". That wasn't the case when I received it. I'd say it was in poor condition as the book was coming apart at the spine."
4,Nice Tale,"This book was abosrbing, once it got going. It seemed to take a LONG time before a ""story"" developed. However, McMurtry spends a lot of time setting and introducing the characters. Sad book, about the final gasps of the Old West. I noticed, however, that some of the characters seemed quite a bit like the ones from Lonesome Dove... Same mannerisms and habits, which was a bit bothersome. Otherwise worth reading!"
4,"Yeah, well","An enjoyable and informative read, though at times presented too romantically and subjectively. A fine job of portraying Dietrich from many angles, fleshing her out (though the author is irritatingly fond of the word ""plump"")... Spoto seems to approach his subject with celestial reverence, as though trying to conceal his own crush behind historical voyeurism (the discussion of debauched 1920s Berlin is particularly gratifying). Sometimes he speculates too much on possible motivations instead of simply offering facts, but he also makes good use of others' reminiscences of Dietrich to back up some of his insightful conjectures. Enjoyable but not riveting."
4,Awesome...,"There are so many of these so-called pop/punk bands out now, but only a few of them are worth listening to. Junction 18 is definately thats worth a chance. ""This Vicious Cycle"" really has no bad songs on it and you can tell this band has talent. Its ashame that most of the good bands today like Junction 18 never get the respect they deserve, while garbage like Creed and Bare Naked Ladies control the air-waves. If you're into bands like The Ataris or Weezer then you'll probubly like Junction 18."
5,One HELL of a CD,"This is a must have for fans of melodic post punk. These guys are busting out on the music scene and it appears they are here to stay with this valiant effort. At such a young age it is going to be very interesting to see how they progress from here. Great sound and well put together lyrics. Not to mention words that touch the soul. Pick this disc up, you won't be disappointed."
2,Another undifferentiated entry into the sea of pop-punk,"There really isn't much new here. If you've heard a lot of pop-punk, and you like that sort of thing, you'll like this. But there isn't anything different in this than, say, yellowcard. Not original and therefore not worth buying, in my opinion."
2,not what i expected,got the key fob and was real excited. read the instructions and from there it was down hill. i emailed the company and someone emailed me back and informed me that i may have to take the fob to a locksmith. if the locksmith doesn't work out i may take it to a dealership. lol this is and was a joke. plan on returning it minus the restock fee they charge which is 20% of the total price. my first and last time ever ordering anything electronic site unseen from god knows who.
5,yummerific!,"Just ordered the Parmesan & Garlic, soooo much cheaper to order a case than to buy them one at a time for $2.99 a bag! However, I did just that with this flavor and WOW...they're fabulous! Gonna order a case of these, too...not sure where I'll put them. Try them with Sabra roasted garlic hummus...heaven!"
3,"For the idea of music, not music itself","Let me first say that we are pleased with the purchase. We got it for our two-year-old in hopes of a greater love of music later on. And for that it has been perfect. Pretty well made, it handles the general bumps that come from a toddler carrying it around. He will often play with me as I play my own. But I have attempted to get good sounds out of it myself, with 'no' result. I tune it to itself...no good. I tune it to my guitar...no good. I even tune it to a specific chord...still no good (at least beyond that chord). I'm no expert, but something is wrong.So we are happy with it for our own reasons, but I would not recommend it if you are actually desiring correct sounds when played."
5,Fabulous,My husband and I love this book. We have now been to 108 B&B's and plan on visiting our 109 at the end of the month. A must have and they make great gifts.
5,GREAT DEAL,"This book came with a free night certificate that you could use if you bought one night. You got the second night for free. What a deal! I took a quick, weekend get away and it saved me over $150. Can't beat that. There were over a thousand inns to choose from. I went to their website, [...] to see even more inns. It will make a great gift."
2,Did not Disclose,I purchased this book for a gift - have done so in years past. It has a coupon in it for a free nights lodging at a bed and breakfast of your choosing when purchasing another night. However when I received it the coupon had only 3 weeks left on it before it expired. The dates of use should have been disclosed under the description at the very least. Rather embarressing!!
5,The Program EVER!!!!!,I am so happy that they are continuing with this program. I have been buying this book with it's free night certificate for many years. You can not get a better deal!My husband and I only stay in B+B's now. They are so much more personable and this program makes it so much more affordable. I have informed other guests of the program as well as friends and coworkers. I look forward to my next B+B stay.Robin
2,Superficial,"We have done a lot of traveling along the East Coast of United States and read several country inn and bed and breakfast guidebooks. This one is one of the most superficial ones that we have reviewed and it offers very limited coverage of the best inns in a given region. Furthermore, the description is brief, superficial and not very informative. The author sacrifices detailed description for the sheer size and geographical coverage of the book. I would not recommend this book to anyone interested in a particular region or some the more charming inns. Obviously, one author cannot cover the whole country and have thorough knowledge of the inns in a particular region. The book is superficial, lacks detail even though it covers the whole country. If you travel along the Atlantic coast you would not want to read a chapter on North Dakota, but would like to learn more about the inns in your region. This is not a book for traveler, but a general overview."

1,EXPIRED coupon,do not purchase this it has an expired coupon...please be aware the coupon is expired!!!! Buy the most updated book~!
5,Big Bang,A fun show to watch. The disk quality is good making for hours of good viewing. Recommend this to many.
5,big bang,I have truly enjoyed the Big Bang Theory.. The fourth season is no different.. I believe that the Big Bang Theory is one of the best sitcoms on television today..possibly even one of the best ones for a really long time..
5,Big bang theory season 4,I love The Big Bang theory and this season was really funny. Sheldon gets a girl friend and its not penny. I love that the cast grew and those who were added. They bring even more smiles to my face.
4,A Step Backward From Previous Years,"Though The Big Bang Theory is still must watch viewing for me, this season felt like something like a step backward from previous years. To be fair, this season has its' share of good moments like Howard's unfortunate incident with the robotic hand for example. I'm concerned that the producers moved too quickly from the original premise of the show of these super-smart guys who struggle to deal with the real world, I would've personally waited another year or two to carry out some of the developments persued in this season.Concearning the actual DVD's: You get the season four episodes, three actor on actor features, a couple of Barenaked Ladies features (making of the theme song video & the actual video, and the customary gag reel.)If your a fan of the show or know one, they'll probably love this set, but this may not be the best season to introduce a new fan to The Big Bang Theory."
4,Funny and enjoyable.,"I enjoy watching The Bang Series, but I do feel all the women on the show brought it down a notch this season."
5,Laughter at your mailbox.,Service great. Item arrived at promised. Haven't viewed DVD's as yet since watching previoius seasons' DVDs first... which are hilarious! Laughing keeps you young! :-)
5,Big Bang Theory,I haven't watched the video yet but I'm sure I will love it. I love the show anyway. Very entertaining.
5,Love it!!,My son loved this series. It's wonderful to hear such laughter from him - he watched the whole series in 2 days
5,Good show,Had many laughs and a great show to watch again and again. Don't let the title get you its really about making fun of science.
1,The Big Bang Theory 4th season,"This set of DVDs would not play. I had to reorder it twice. The third time was a charm, if I recall. I still have the other two sets. The envelope I kept says Cariboo Park in California so I'm not sure if this is where the good one came from or not. You can check your records to see where the third set was from."
4,TBBT is better in Blu-Ray,"I mean it's a tv show season for your own, it's a great show, I enjoy it. I prefer it on blu-ray to maximize the most of my entertainment setup but yeah I think buying it through amazon was cheaper than going through my local best buy. im content with my purchase."
3,Gift for My Husband,"The Big Bang Theory has lost some of the sweetness of earlier seasons, and I feel the humor is more and more cutting. Seems like the writers should be able to maintain the humor of the show while having the characters evolve. I'm disappointed that the characters have shown no growth over the years. Walowitz is the exception, still obnoxious but admitting he needs Bernadette and only Bernadette. Having said that, there are still fine moments of comedy and my husband loves this show. He. Laughs. At. Every. Single. Season."
5,Late Viewer,We came upon BBT by accident and loved it. Have since bought all 4 Seasons and we have really enjoyed watching them. Looking foward for Season 5 to come out on DVD.
5,The Big Bang Theory - Season 4,I love the Big Ban Theory! I can watch the episodes over and over again. I plan to buy all of them.
5,Favorite current series!,"BAZINGA! Can't get enough of Sheldon, Leonard, Penny, Raj, and Wolowitz!!!! And now Amy Farrah Fowler!!! Just PERFECT for Sheldon!!"
3,"4 Stars for Show; 2 Stars for DVD Quality,","I'm really annoyed with the so-called ""DVD"" quality of Season 4. It's about as high-res as a youtube video-clip expanded in fullscreen mode, where low-resolution ""pixelation"" occurs throughout all the shows. There's a very big difference between the video quality of this season compared to seasons 1 through 3, which I also own. The worst example is on Disc 1's advert to let people know that TBBT will be showing 5 days a week before the video loads into the menu screen - it's horrible.This makes me wonder whether I got a pirated disc instead of the original. If you have a similar experience, please let me know! I don't know if this is WB's problem or the seller I bought from."
5,Big Bang Theory Season 4,"I love the Big Bang Theory, can't go wrong with Season 4. I have all the preceding Seasons and love them all"
3,Some funny moments,"It was okay. I like all the big band theory episodes. Some are better than others but overall, if you like the big band theory than you want the whole collection no matter if some are better than others. So that is why I gave it 3 stars because for the big bang theory likers we'll buy it no matter if it is good or bad as long as we can add it to the collection."
5,Super Fan,Nothing makes me laugh more than Sheldon and Penny. I love The Big Bang. I can watch all day long.
2,disappointed,"I recieved this movie in a timely manner but discs 1 and 3 are making a horrible noice and play for a bit and stop, the discs look warped. I have tried emailing but no one responded. I would really like to return it and get what i paid for."
3,lost a bit of the lustre.,I loved the first three seasons of this show but my complaint is that there are getting to be to many characters. I eventually got used to Amy but I lost all interest in Howards girl. He was much funnier when he was on the constant prowl. It seems to me too many things and people are being crammed in each episode.
1,The Big Bang Theory Season 4 DVD,"Season 4, is, of course...brilliant, but not so the DVD version. Watched disc #1 of 3 and will be bringing it back to the store today. The audio is dull, lifeless, bass heavy and not in sync with the video. Also, the player rejected the disc at Episode 6. Tried various sound fields and none worked well. Even tried to sync the audio with the video and neither the player (Denon A1UDCI), nor the receiver (Denon AVR-4810CI) could accomplish the task. Tried it on our other audio video system using a Denon 5910CI player and the audio was just as bad.Fair warning--buy this disc and it might have to be returned, but the video part is fun to watch. Too bad about the rest....."
5,great but too sexual,"I absolutely LOVED this season! Amy and Bernadette made it so much nicer. I love the character of Amy and how she and Sheldon interact. I know a lot of people are upset Sheldon has a friend girl and that her character is evolving. I think it's perfect and realistic. She is able to help him assimilate in the real world since she always has a logical explanation for the new behavior. If Amy left the show, I would be devastated. However, I think this season is focused a little too much on sex. Every other line is a reference to masturbation or sex, etc. It's funny, but it's a bit too much. It's sometimes uncomfortable to watch because of all the sex."
1,PreOrder Big Bang Theory,The fouth season of the Big Bang Theory video quality is not good at all. I am very disappointed in it. I have ordered the first 3 sessions and they were great. I preordered the one last year and the DVD was great. For some reason this season didn't have the same quality. The picture is blurry and you cant see the great reactions on the characters faces.
1,Is unable to be viewed on our DVD player,"I purchased seasons 1 through 5....there was only one vendor at the time with season 4. It just so happened that vendor was from the UK. The postage was only a few dollars, so I purchased it. A few weeks after delivery, I was ready for season 4. Upon trying to view it, I discovered that it was not compatible with our DVD player. I will be trying to get a refund."
1,"Elaine was enough, why not so for Penny?","Elaine could hold her own with 'the guys' on Seinfeld, so why not Penny in BBT? Penny was doing a great job, so why has her role been so drastically cut in Season 4? Mr. Lorre ('Mister' as a sign of respect because I am a huge fan), look at your Mike and Molly: It has many characters, but they all seem to blend better that BBT....Toooooo many girlfriends? In fact, Amy is getting too much of a chunk of the show. Loved seasons 1-2-3..... now the thrill is gone. I won't be purchasing Season 4.... not funny enough to re-watch. Hope to see an improved Season 5!"
3,Great show but. . .,I am a huge fan of The Big Bang Theory. I have Seasons 1-3 on DVD and while I want to get season 4 i've got one nagging issue.I am so tired of the character of Amy Farrah Fowler. So much so that as of the last episode I no longer want to watch the show when it airs without an episode summary to let me know if she is in it or not.Please I love this show but Amy Farrah Fowler is just killing it.
3,Who staged the bukake themed cover image?!,"It's a bit shocking and distasteful that they chose to go with a bukake theme for the cover image.If you think I'm overreacting look at at the large version of the image. Note the right hand of the guy on our left. I know, he's playing air guitar. But that right hand isn't playing any kind of air guitar I'm familiar with... it looks more like pocket pool.And the bent knee poses of him and the guy on our right... while the poor woman lays at their feet on a ""water""proof floor and a ""water""proof outfit....Just disgusting.... but this is not intended as a comment on the quality of the show itself!"
4,This is so funny,So relaxing after long work day to just laugh at these funny guys and Penny I have all the seasons terrific purchase!
5,"""Big Bang"" Keeps You Laughing","""The Big Bang Theory"" reveals the hilarious results when book smarts fail to transfer into life skills. Of all 4 series, this is the best."
2,Priya Has To Go. I miss Penny.,"I'm not sure if they brought Priya in to replace Penny, or what, but she has to go. She's a great actress but there just is not any chemistry there, scenes with her are just too serious. Penny worked. Her character worked. She brought a balance to their nerdiness.Also, I enjoy Amy in the show, I think she brings a nice touch and I keep waiting for them to hook her and Sheldon up on a real date... as is my family and circle of friends.Also, I miss the quirkiness of the first season. I miss what made the show unique and special and funny! And I've grown rather tired of all the sexual tensions and crap, I say save that for ""2 and a Half Men"" or some other show. Return this to the near-family friendly show that it was."
4,"Not the best Season, but still great","I am about halfway through the season. It is entertaining, but not the best season. Not many shows at their best can match Big Bang at its worst."
5,Best Comedy on TV,Big Bang Theory is the funniest show on TV. The DVD is great quality and we enjoy watching the episodes over and over again. And we got a GREAT price on Amazon.com!!!
3,big bang,"great cast fuuny stories good one liner, only problem is most of the shows are dark. poss bad copy over all the show is great"
5,Fun,Was a Christmas gift for my neice and she loved it! I received the item quickly and in good condition.
4,love the show.... amy HAS to go,"I have always loved Big Bang Theory, and this season is no different with the exception of the character of Amy. I have an extremely hard time watching the episodes that she is in, and a lot of time end up skipping those episodes."
5,A hilarious comedy,I hope this show has a few more years of ideas. not manny shows make me laugh out loud. This one does.
5,Great buy!!,Big Bang Theory is even better in Season 4 as the cast is developing into an even more hilarious group than they were before. Definitely worth the price for the laughs!!
3,The magic is gone,"I'm still watching this series because I like the characters. However, the magic has died and I doubt I'll bother with season 5. It's turned into a show about (1) relationship humor (2) how quirky Sheldon is. The characters have become a sum of their idiosyncrasies and it's been dumbed-down so even the geeky references are borderline pop-culture."
5,Fantastic,Funniest show on television in a long time! The interaction between characters is well scripted. Even though some of the physics commentary is incorrect it still provides great entertainment.
4,Very Good,"Consistently good script-writing makes each episode in this season worth viewing; some episodes are even brilliant. Overall, this season is a bit more consistent than Season 3, which has its most moments of brilliance but from time to time suffers from mediocre writing.Even then, the characters are awesome and will compel you to keep watching. Before you know it, you're done. Really great show!"
5,FYI: Futuretense Revealed :)_,"As stated on the TV On DVD website ""Big Bang Theory 4.0"" due on 09-13-11, 24 episodes on four disks, SRP (HA...Ha..ha)$44.98 from the W.B.Does anybody really charge anything but $0.99 in reality ?Have fun :)"
4,Big Bang,I really enjoy the Big Bang Theory...I enjoyed it a lot more when it was not as sexual as it is now...I would rather them stay with the science aspect of it opposed to conforming to society and just doing the whole sex sells thing...don't get me wrong the humor is still there just more sex related stuff than the past.
1,Big Bang,I never got the product as I live outside the US yet I paid for it.Is it possible to have my money bacy?
4,Quite Lovely,"These are truly lovely - just as they're pictured. They seem well made (the stones are even sized and pretty, and the backings seem ok). Seriously, a great value!"
4,Terry Shower Wrap,"I think its a great product! Soft, absorbs water well, and feels good! My only complaint is it is about, 5"" too long for my personal taste, I think if I could cut if off, and then have somebody hem it, it would be 5 stars!"
4,still rockin',was a little upset that products ordered from same person were mailed separately & THIRD PRODUCT WAS NOT REC'D EVEN THOUGH IT HAD BEEEN LISTED AS AVAILABLE
2,Just Couldn't Keep It Down,"I almost bought this album.. thank goodness for the song list that included such sad, sorry songs as ""We Built This City"", Hold On Loosly"", and ""Heart of Rock & Roll"". I saved a lot of dollars. The rest of it had some promise. I am a HUGE fan of '80s music, but these songs were so over-played, I'm still sick of them."
4,My 4 year old loves it!,"I bought this as an Easter present for my 4 year old son, who loves Scooby Doo. He absolutely loves this game! A few parts are a little hard, problem solving and running back and forth to unlock doors and what-not; but with a little help he moves along just fine. It's much easier than the other Gamecube Scooby games, and he is definitely getting plenty of gameplay out of it. The only reason I give it 4 stars is because sometimes the problem solving parts are pretty hard, and I can't even help him. But that being said, I would highly recommend this game!"
2,A little too hard for me,This game seems to be hard. Especially for me. I think the graphics are fine but the only problem is that Velma's hands look too big indeed. Although I haven't gotten too far in this game. I am stuck on Episode 3: Weird Wild West. I always like to play as both Shaggy and Scooby Doo. The only Scooby Doo game that I enjoy is ScoobyDoo Night of 100 Frights. All of the other Scooby Doo games I don't enjoy.
2,So-So,"I struggled to get through this book. I thought it would be more along the lines of true stories about women who had visited a remote clinic for fistulas. Instead, it was an accounting of the history of a fistula hospital, the fundraising efforts to run the hospital and a few anectodal mentions of the women who passed through their doors. I got tired of the author waxing prolific about how wonderful and hardworking her husband was (""OK... fine. I get it already. He was wonderful, a saint, blah blah blah"" I thought to myself many times). The author also repeated herself several times throughout the book and I think parts of it could have been edited better to avoid this.At this point I have no desire to read more books about fistual patients and fistula hospitals. I was drawn to this book after reading ""Cutting for Stone"" but this just didn't do it for me and would have a hard time recommending it to anyone else."
5,Book review,This is an excellent book! I purchased it for a friend after having read it myself. It is inspiring and heartbreaking. If you enjoy non-fiction I highly recommend it.
5,"Food for Thought, Particularly in Today's Crises","Despite his stuffy early-20th century journalistic style, Mr. Stoddard has an admirable blend of narrative eloquence and historical plotting. The tale of the sad land now known as Haiti is as repugnant a fable as can be imagined; yet Stoddard doggedly plows through it, with every atrocity and mass-murder duly noted. It is a signal warning to modern Americans."
1,TINY PITCHER!,"Only holds 4 cups!! Very tiny pitcher, not sure why anyone would buy it. I returned mine."
4,the revolutionary king,"I had learnded a lot about the king RAMAiX 'life,his idea and opinions and actions. I am knowing more about the royal children and the Queen.The author give a fair biography of the King in spite he was invited by the King to write the biography. This book is good book to Thai people to read."
4,Great Price for What it is!,"We got this ring for me to wear while my fiance was having a tension set titanium ring designed and made for me locally. I feel that the size runs slightly large. The best thing about this ring is that it is SO durable. I NEVER take it off(I now wear it on my right hand). I do yard work, cook, work on my car and even have laid a brick fireplace. I am NOT a large person, 5'4"" and have VERY small hands and I don't feel as though this ring is too large. The description states the width in millimeters, if you don't want a wide band, this one is not for you!"
3,"'one problem""","This is an excellent, stereo, two album collection with fine remastering except for one problem. Track one, the title song ""Have Mercy"" has a tracking error rendering this track unplayable on my computer, my car CD player, my DVD players or my home stereo CD players. All of the rest of the songs on the CD play flawlessly. The error cannot be repaired by scandisc either. I liked the CD so much that I purchased another one from Amazon. The 2nd CD had the same problem. This is a defect overlooked by the people who press CD's for the Koch label. I have other Koch recordings in my collection and have not had this problem. I hope they will place more emphasis on quality control. This is a 5 star CD that I can only give 3 stars due to the error."
2,i think this book is boring,my mom said i could by any book from amazon for christmas so i bawt this one but its boring the people dont cast spels and there arent any dragons but it was kind of fun.
4,Nice Easy To Read Book to Create Your Persona with!,"I learned how to market myself more effectively from Seth and Jay.I really like all the neat packaged strategies people can implement for business and for getting immediate results.Chapter Six on Application:It's a great chapter.I did the exercises.I got results.This books is for Neuro Linguistic Programmers,Trainers, Entrepreneurs or anybody who doesn'tknow jack about MARKETING YOURSELF!"
4,some good ideas here,"they may appear basic to some, but the fact is that we often forget to do the basics . . . this book will help you to remember them!"
4,Punk Rawk Show,"Well Punk Rawk Show was allright. Such punk bands as AFI, MxPx, and Pennywise appear on the movie. They show a ""behide the scenes"" of a Blink-182 video. I gave it a 4, I would have given it a 5, but Blink-182 killed it as always. Either than that go get it now."
1,S.S.S.(Space Saving Stand),"The vertical stand allows for space to be used efficiently, besides, it looks cool!"
1,Dont Waste Your money,"I have bought this from a local retailer. I thought that it would somehow elevate my PS2, so that it might not suck in any extra dirt. Well it sits flattly under the PS2, and is nothing more than cosmetic. And it barely even does that!"
2,"Very cool looking, but a waste of money...","According to Sony, when the PlayStation 2 was first designed, it included the blue bar that comes with the horizontal stand. For whatever reason, they decided to remove this feature. Maybe to get to get us to dish out another 10 bucks, but most likely because while it looks cool in the horizontal position, the blue bar would look pretty bad when the PS2 is used in the vertical position. Asides from that, the horizontal stand is completely useless. It does not add any extra stability to the unit, and when you pick up the PS2 to move it you must move the stand too, they do not become attached. If I were you, (and I did the same thing), I would put the 10 bucks towards a vertical stand, which is both cool looking and useful."
4,Good Lookin,I think that this looks good and that's all. It's pretty useless because the PS2 is already horizontal.
1,This Product is a Waste of Money,"I was one of the lucky people to get a PS2, so i wanted to buy the stand but its a waste of money. All it does is prop your PS2 up a couple of inches....THATS IT! this is a waste of money and so is the vertical stand. your PS2 stands verticaly perfectly fine by itself. DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!"
2,Not worth it,I bought the horizontal stand for my PS2 thinking that it would be better than the vertical one. I was afraid that it would be hard to load games with the vertical stand. But it turns out that it is just as easy to load games with the PS2 standing vertically and also the system looks a lot cooler standing vertically. The horizontal stand does not serve any purpose. I sudjest that you save your ten dollars or that you buy the vertical stand.
3,Horizontal stand not to good,"I dont think this is a great item, it does nothing really for the game console and it cant hold games or accessories so i would say unless you have ... to blow and want your psx2 to look pretty get it but if not dont.!"
2,You Don't Really Need This,"Most people who already have their Playstation 2 in a secure cabinet or on a table don't need this. But, if you have you PS2 just sitting on the floor you might want to think about buying one these. Some people might think that this is safer than vertical stand but it really isn't. On the PS2's DVD-ROM there is an extra piece of plastic that holds your game in place if you have the vertical stand. If you live somewhere there are a lot of earthquakes and you are paranoided about your PS2 then get the vertical stand."
5,Grow in your walk with God and as a parent,This devotional book is excellent and is relevant to parents with children of all ages from birth to the soon to be married. It is both informative and encouraging. The book includes excerpts from other parenting books thus providing variety and other sources to develop strong Christian parenting skills. I have enjoyed this book so much that I plan to purchase copies to give to new parents whom I teach in Prepared Parenting Classes.
4,Another good one from this series,"I have read all of the books in this series and they are all pleasent to read. Will be interesting to see what the author does with Savanah's love life.. The mysteries are always well thought out, and all of the secondary characters are wonderful and add a nice touch to this series. If you haven't started this series, you might want to, start with the 1st book though."
4,A GREAT Boris,"Alexander Kipnis was such a highly regarded interpreter of the title role of Boris Godunov that his costume as Boris is in the Smithsonian. One of the great basses of the first half of the 20th century, he emigrated to America where he lived in Westport, Connecticut and made his career at the Metropolitan Opera.But this is more than just an historical recording. The pre-World War II recording sound is not great, but it is plenty good enough to give you an accurate picture of Kipnis' glorious voice and tremendous artistry."
3,Kipnis delivers somewhat,"When I saw that this was being offered i figured, what could i lose? the best tracks on this CD are the ones from the ""Song of the Flea"" onward. I, in particular, did I enjoy the voice and piano works on this CD. It is certainly not the best output of such a distinguished artist, but it is not his worst either."
5,Furiously Good,"Sherman writes in a mastetrful and compelling fashion. The only baffling thing is you can't put this book down. Be ready to give up sleep. Great story telling, well developed characters. These are my all time favorite books."
4,Kicks some alien @$$,"The 34th is still embroiled in its battle against the invading aliens on the planet of Kingdom and like most militaries, it has as much trouble with the politicians as it does with the enemies. They are also still doing so with élan, spirit de corps and good old fashioned jarhead toughness.The aliens are quite different than your normal science fiction fare. They are amphibians and instead of using fancy ray guns, they use acid. They are tough and utterly alien but they are also up against the finest military tradition on earth.The book feels the loss of Gunnery Sgt. Bass, apparently killed in the last volume, but there is reason for hope. A character who is probably him turns up for a few pages at the very end. Now I just have to wait for the next book to come in.It's a good story."
2,"Great Product, deceptive sale!","I specifically ordered the 100mL & received the 75ml; I intentionally PAID MORE for the extra 25ml, yet did NOT receive the larger size. I WILL NOT be ordering from THIS company again! They clearly state the 100 mL, this is VERY upsetting because I LOVE this Hauschka product! I feel very deceived. Shame on you!"
5,Amazing melodic metal in its finest form !!!,"Okay I borrowed this CD about a year ago and I really couldn't get into it then but after hearing Soilwork and other melodic metal bands lately I decided to give In Flames another shot. This CD is what I'm currently listening to right now. I love it. I really like the melodic interludes placed throughout the disc. Gives it a true metal feel. The guitar riffs, drumming and vocals are top notch. Now I can understand why everyone likes this band so much. A must have in any metal collection !!!"
5,Brilliant!,"I have to agree with most of the reviewers when they say that this is the most intense and energetic effort by In Flames. While it lacks a little of the epic feel of ""Jester Race"", and ""Whoracle"", ""Colony"" makes up for it in sheer non-stop intensity, brilliant songwriting, and emotional lyrics and vocals. If you consider yourself a fan of death metal, particularly the gothenburg scene, you definitely need to make this your next purchase. This cd is my third In Flames purchase, after ""Jester Race"", and ""Whoracle"", and now I plan on getting ""Clayman"".My only complaint with this cd lies in the production. Maybe its just me, but the bass on this cd seems to be severely lacking, compared to their other releases. I don't believe this is a flaw in musicianship, I believe it is a flaw in production, thats why I still gave it 5 stars. Has anyone else noticed this?"
5,A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!,"the first week i had this album it had overplayed it's self. i love it. the guitars are great,drums are great, as well as the vocals. anders' singing voice can be heard in 'ordinary story' and itsounds really good. that track is my most frequently listened to song off the album. you should check this album out cause it knocked me flat when i popped it in the player."
4,wicked headbanging music,"When I heard their songs, I was completely blown away. In Flames really separates themselves off from the typical death metal sound. I have no means to disrespect other ""death"" fanatics,but most bands in the same genre just totally suck, they sound all the same, and have no sense of musicianship."
4,"Rock, this cd is awesome!!!!!","this cd is awesome, i think it sound similar to to the previous ones but hey, it's their work, if they want to borrow some of it they can, this cd is the bomb and i hope that they keep producing albums as good as theese."
5,One of the best,"In Flames is just simply amazing. The way the guitars weave an amazing sound over the best rhythm section in metal is just awe inspiring. Colony is also In Flames best album IMO, just because it has one of the best songs ever in Zombie Inc.The album starts off with the great and ends great, even the acoustic track fits in perfectly. Every member of the band is incredibly talent and if you like music in general you need to give this album a spin.A couple other bands you have to check out are Dark Tranquility, Opeth, and At The Gates."
3,Sweedish death metal.,"Good album but not as good as some other sweedish bands, like Therion. The songs in 'Colony' rarely reach 4 minutes and the construction of the compositions aren't so complex. Vocals ala Phil Anselmo here. But hey, this is a sweedish death metal band, it's still great, how couldn't it? This combination always works."
3,Three out of Five Stars is probally pushing it!,"By far this is not In Flames best cd! The harmonies sucked the acoustic interludes were not there, and it just does not sound like the old In Flames that everyone loves. But, I should not leave out that the cd was somewhat good. They had some good guitar riffs in certain songs and Resin kinda sounds like ""Gyroscope"", which was a kick a** song off ""Whoracle""! The rest of the cd was good, but it just doesn't hold up to the Subterrainean, Jester Race, and Whoracle albums! I suggest listening to it before you make the decision to buy it or not..."
5,Winding Plotline,Several generations of families are thrown into various tragedies as the plot twists and turns to offer many surprises.
1,"ok, but in flames worst","well, i actually rate this 3 stars, but too many people overrated this album at 5 stars, so i rated low to compensate. not that it'll change things anyway :) this one just doesn't have the melodies of jester race or whoracle. If you want an updated in flames sound, get clayman before this. I rank the albums in this order: Jester Race JUST edges out clayman (CLOSE!), whoracle, lunar strain/subterranean, then colony. I really don't know how in flames fans praise this album, it really has nothing compared to the other albums. Don't get me wrong, it's still decent, but not great. The real moment of brilliance on this CD is on song 5 (zombie, inc) from about 2:10 in to 3:18. That's some good stuff! but the rest is so-so. Do yourself a favor and get Jester Race and Clayman first, comming from a true fan, from back in the day."
3,Sweedish death metal.,"Good album but not as good as some other sweedish bands, like Therion. The songs in 'Colony' rarely reach 4 minutes and the construction of the compositions aren't complex. But hey, this is a sweedish death metal band, it's still great, how couldn't it? This combination always works."
5,This thing kicks,"Ratings on Amazon tend to be inflated; I guess people typically review what they are interested in (and hence usually like). But I had never listened to In Flames before this album. I can't think of anything to compare it to. The music is extremely heavy, yet melodic and uplifting. Production is very clear, and the songs are varied and distinct. Fun to listen to, and very high-energy. It may not satisfy death metal purists (not evil-sounding) but forget categories, this is good stuff . I imagine it could be popular if the band got more exposure. The only weak point is the lyrics; although the subject of the songs is worthy they are a bit weird; you can tell they don't speak English too well. But with their sound, who cares."
4,Colony,"Just like Whoracle, Colony starts off with unleashed fury! Ripping into songs like embody the invisible and Scorn, In flames' third release is seeing the band progress and losing a lot of the medieval influence they had in their two previous albums. Replacing it with a more aggressive style. While the medieval influence is still there, it's not very noticable. The trademark twin guitar harmonies and Anders fierce vocals are still present on the album. Although there is a change in the line-up, guitarist Glenn Ljungstrom left, replaced by drummer Bjorn Gelotte and they got Sacrlege's drummer and singer Daniel Svensson for drums. While Colony is one of my favorite In Flames' albums, it does drag after the fifth song. Nonetheless, Colony kicks a lot of ass. Period."
5,Metal to make the world go round,"In Flames, Colony has to be the best cd in my metal collection. Right off the bat with Embody the Invisible you just want to get up and kick the furniture. Ordinary Story takes the tone down until you get used to it then it jumps up again and kicks you in the nuts. The title track is just amazing and Zombie Inc says it like it is if you look around. Behind Space 99 is as brutal as it gets. When the song kicks it up a notch after the first minute all control goes out the window and you will begin to swing your arms wildly against any will you have left. If you do not have this cd then you cannot full understand what I speak of. Buy it now. If there ever was a cd to buy, this is it"
3,This CD has an amazing start...,"especially the first 6 songs, which blew my mind when i first heard them. My favorite part of this album is between the 2:09 - 3:10 in the song ""Zombie Inc."". This is where some of In Flames musical friggin genius absolutely shines. Yet after ""Pallars Anders Visa"", the CD just about stops with me taking it out and replacing it. I love the first songs, yet really dislike the 2nd half."
3,ive heard better,the first track is one of the best on the cd but ordinary story and scorn have tons of nu metal elements including computerized vocals which are annoying. zombies inc. is an amazing track. truly shows their skill. if only the album had been this good. pallars anders visa is an alrite acoustic track yet not as good as jesters dance or any dissection accoustics. after the acoustic most of the tracks are alrite but nothing stands out.the guitars are amazing in some tracks and less than par in others.the drums serve their purpose but don't stand out as anything special.bass seems unimportant with the guitars dominating over it. the bass deserves more time to be heard and a more important part in a metal band.annoying vocals litter this album. yet when the vocalist growls without a computer changing his voice its awesome sounding. lyrically zombies inc. is the best track as well and other tracks lyrics seem less poetic than expected.
5,perfection of the melodic death metal sound,"when i first heard of in flames, i thought they were just another one of those cheesy bands that gets up there and screams about death, dying, and how much life sucks. I was proven dead wrong. This is one of my favorite albums. every single song on here is good. even the acoustic ""pallar anders visa"" adds a nice mix to the bunch. If your into any kind of heavy music (hardcore, metal, etc.) this is for you. Colony is far more than worthy of your hard-earned cash."
4,Solid album to add to your playlist,"You can NEVER go wrong with these guys, listen to the diverse and melodic change that has occurred from their early days to present Playground album."
5,EXCELLENT!!!!!!!!!,"Whoa! What an album! Where can I start. This album has everything..melody, hardcore riffs, melodic riffs, mind pumelling drumming, and I love the guy's voice..I've neard heard nothing like this..the album keeps your head banging and also manages to keep beautiful melodies..its sort of a cross between Slayer and Iron Maiden...but this vocalist is much better than Tom or Dickinson...Definitely buy this masterpiece!!!!!!"
3,In Flames - Decent,"This was my first In Flames cd, and it was recommended to me from a metal-loving buddy. The first time I picked it up and listened to it, I was about to throw it away, take a Tylenol, and ask my friend ""what the hell was that supposed to be?"". However, upon a few more listens, I really grew attached to the music. I love the guitar riffs and all, but what about the vocals! The guy rarely sings, its all the same kind of monotone growling. ""Coerced Coexistence"" is probably my favorite song because he actually sings the chorus. And the dude REALLY CAN SING! It blows me away. If he has this much talent, he should use it! The sad thing is, if he does, he'll probably be considered a sellout by his so-called fans. Bummer."
1,BE AWARE OF THIS SELLER!,"I ordered an 'Original HP LaserJet 13X Black Cartridge in Retail Packaging'. What I received was a re-manufactured laser toner cartridge in an Office Depot box that says remanufactured on it. Also, the cartridge I received is defective - the strip cannot be pulled out of the cartridge, and there is a large chip on the drum. I have made repeated demands of ab4dd0n to allow me to return this item and refund all monies, but they refuse. They say they advertised the Office Depot cartridge. They did not. I have sent them proof of what their ad said, but they ignore everything I have sent them. They also have not addressed the defect problems. This appears to me to be a 'bait and switch' situation. I do not feel ab4dd0n should be allowed to get away with this. EVERYONE SHOULD AVOID DOING BUSINESS WITH ab4dd0n! I had to file a claim through Amazon to get my money back which I was able to do. Thank goodness for their A-to-Z Guarantee program!"
1,Fake Toner,"This was not a genuine HP toner -- from the very first page, it produced terrible, light, marked-up, illegible print-outs. Do not buy products from CVrink!I had bought it early as a back-up so I could not even return it when I discovered the problem. I ended up buying another toner directly from HP which is working beautifully."
2,HP 13X,"I first ordered the product, and was given a reasonable delivery date.I later received an e-mail confirming the aBOVE, BUT GIVING ME A DELIVERY DATE MUCH LATER. i NEEDED THE PRODUCT MUCH SOONER, AND HAD TO GO OUT AND PURCHASE THE PRODUCT.WHEN THE PRODUCTS CAME IN, THE FIRST ONE I TRIED WAS DEFECTIVE. I THEN E-MAILED THE VENDOR, WHO REPLIED THAT THEY WERE ON VACATION THAT WEEK BUT WOULD SEND ME A REPLACEMENT THE FOLLOING WEEK. THAT WEEK HAS COME & GONE, & STILL NO REPLACEMENT."
1,bad album by Dionne,I bought a cd of this album upon one recommendation from Amazon and wish I hadn't. It doesn't even sound like her singing. Dionne is famous for her passionate music with rich low notes. It's totally missing in this album. This sounds like one of her first albums before developing her own style. I love Dionne's rich style of singing and it just isn't on this album.
4,good,"I was a little skeptical at first of the arm band was going to be too bright than seems to be in the picture, and it is, however it is more comfortable and easier to wear than the others I have purchased in the past. also the armband is more likely to stay on during my more physical workouts,"
5,Frighteningly Funny,"What can one say? These politicians are every bit as ludicrously funny as one might expect...although it certainly gives one pause. Who's more stupid? We who vote for these people or those for whom we vote? Well, at least they give us a well-deserved laugh on the taxpayer dollar. This is a very funny book, although I tend to think the compilers could have made it much longer! Shall we expect vols. 2, 3, 4, 5, etc.? I hope so."
3,"Will Make You Say ""Huh?""","I bought this book for my dad because he's into politics. I read the book myself and a lot of the quotes made me go, ""Huh?"" That's exactly what the quotes in this book will do to you. Many politicians, I guess, have said things that don't make sense or are just downright dumb. For example, there's the one about the politician who tries to order a Chablis at McDonald's. A Chablis at McDonald's?! Helll-ooo! Where did he think he was, anyway? Sadly, politicians have also said things that are downright racist or sexist, which shows how ignorant they can really be. And these are the people who are supposed to be representing us."
2,YUK...my least favorite thus far...,"Shaped like Mushroom Caps and similar consistency.......Loma Linda Tender Bits, 19-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)....I paid $70.45 for 12 of these I also bought several of the other products from this brand....They are Heavy ALL were shipped in On large box...SEVERAL cans have HUGE dents in them..."
2,High Sodium!,"Is there some reason, still, even today, when we know better, that canned food, even Vegan canned food, is so salty we could use it to repel snails and slugs?If you want to make these palatable, soak in clear water for a few hours before preparing - after soaking they don't taste half bad."
5,I love these!,"I love these, they are tasty and easy to incorporate into your favorite non-chicken recipe! I like the texture and the flavor is good too. I wish they were easier to find. I have only been able to find them at Amazon. I would love for Worthington/Loma Linda to bring back their TUNO. That is my absolute favorite food in the world and they discontinued it."
1,Loma Linda Tender Bits,"Recieved my order quickly, unfortunately, Loma Linda Linketts were shipped instead of the Tender Bits. I was so in the mood, these are so wonderful fried w/ a little crisp around the edges."
1,Horrible!,"If you've ever eaten real meat, or you are currently a meat eater trying to go veggie, this is not the product for you.Putting aside that this stuff doesn't taste like chicken (forgivable because it isn't chicken); it does taste like a cross between cardboard box and dog food. It's a sort of brownish color, a terrible texture (like when you cook chicken and there's a bit of cooked blood--imagine someone sculpting a patty out of that).I coated and fried mine. It was so awful that none of us could eat it and we ended up going out for dinner."
2,not my favorite chicken substitute,"after reading al the reviews, i tried this product and do not like the consistency. I found that if i cook it in the microwave for a few minutes before using in recipes it is slightly more palatable. this is not my favorite chicken substitute - prefer the fri chik over this product."
3,"OK, but not as good as other Loma LInda products","I would rate this product as just OK, but not as good as other Loma LInda products. I love the Salisbury Steak and the Big Franks, but this one is a big disappointing. It has no chicken flavor, but is useful as a protein substitute and tastes very bland and OK. I would also like the same amount in a case, but in smaller cans."
5,AMAZING- Only if Fried!!!!,"I make these and non-vegetarians beg for more. I'm forbidden from bringing anything else to potlucks.I first ate these in a stir fry and they were terrible.Then, after re-reading the reviews, I drained them, patted them dry, and dredged them in a flour/paprika mixture and fried them til dark golden. They're amazing dipped in BBQ sauce, honey mustard, a hot sauce/butter mixture, general tso's sauce - you name it. DELICIOUS! My friend's love them and none of them are vegetarians. Even my extremely picky vegetarian husband will eat them."
5,"brown them, stir fry",These make a great addition to stir fry. I've also just dipped them into sauces after frying them (breaded or not). Can't beat the nutritional value or the taste with any other canned chicken substitute I've found.
4,stores a charge,Works fine at this point. Have to wait and see how it lasts. Wish it would have come with some type of mounting bracket.
4,Overlooked orchestra of jazz/fusion,"""Go Away"" a song from the HenHouse Sessions Volume One album is what prompted me to buy this album, Wishful Thinkin'. Although ""Go Away"" sounds most groovy and better than the songs here, this album is far from a miss. By the way, ""Go Away"" is NOT on this album. Bummer.Jazz/fusion throughout the disc in a smooth fashion within the 8 members of House Brew. The tunes worth the while, all of them, except the skits and interludes of ""Prelude"", ""One More"", ""Message 26"" and ""Tomorrow's My Reprise"". But my choice tunes are ""Tomorrow's My Surprise"", the title track and ""If I Ever""."
5,Joyful,"Honestly, a beautiful CD. Really good musicians lovin what their doin. Danny Moynahan's lead vocals are authentic and pure. A lot of fun from start to finish."
1,Ewww,Really big and gaudy and the gemstones fell out in the box before I even had a chance to put it in. Not worth the price!!!
1,I don't see how a Supertramp fan could like this,"If you've never heard of Supertramp and you wanted to write a term paper about the band, this is the video for you. This is almost entirely a video of critics and analysts dissecting the music of Supertramp.But even with that, in the first 5 minutes there is a terribly critical error. Two of the analysts talk about their use of the Rhodes piano. This ruined any credibility that I could have had. Supertramp used a Wurlizter electric piano and an acoustic piano. They even show tons of video footage of the Wurlizter. So how good are these critics then?"
2,Disappointed,"I originally bought this dvd because it appeared to include tracks of their music , which I enjoy a great deal. Unfortunately there was little of this"
2,"""Painfully"" small screen","The screen on this handheld tetris is very very small. After playing this for 20 minutes my eyes felt terrible and I got a headache. I'm 28 years old, played countless handhelds in my life and I am on my droid cellphone all day long with no problems. This is just a horrible design and should be taken off the market. The entire unit is a nice size and I'm having trouble understanding why they would make the screen so small in relation to the rest of the unit. Don't waste your money on this and I wouldn't let children use it, it can't be good for eye health."
4,Great for small arms,I really like this sport armband! I'm a girl with small arms and this fits perfect! My only negative comment is that you have to take the ipod out of the case to use the dial because the clear coating is so thick. I really like it though!! I just hope the Velcro holds up!
5,Rebecca Foster is my new favorite author,Read her first book because it was free and the first of a series. Have enjoyed each one more than the last. The only think I don't like is the cover on the hard/paperback books. Scary!
3,a good series,"this is the third of the witness series.in spite of the flaws of the two previous books (typos and missed punctuation marks) this is another good read.one of the things that i appreciate in the series is the fact that not all clients that josie handles are guiltless. in a sense, there is no real formula.it is suggested too, that you must read the previous books because characters are no longer introduced like in the first book. and while this series is a legal thriller, not everything is centeted inside the courtroom. there still remains an adventure to enjoy and the courtroom is just the backdrop.if you enjoyed the first two books, there is a big chance you will like this too."
5,Privileged Witness,This is one of a series from Rebecca Forster and I have read them all. Very enjoyable. Excellent read. Recommended.
2,Privileged Witness,I have always been a James Patterson reader. Rebbecca Forester is just as good! Highly recommend her books:) Great series.
4,Somewhat predictable but a good excape read,"Although the plot and story line is predicable, it was a good read.... the story line was interesting and kept me interested. glad I read it."
4,Terrific Book But...,"I gave this book 4 stars, it was an excellent story and now I have read all three in the Witness Series and enjoyed everyone one of them. The story and characters are believable and I really enjoyed this book as well as the first two. However, I have to agree with another reviewer about the mistakes in regards to editing throughout the entire book. It was very bad and I was very disappointed with that aspect of the book. It does take away from the enjoyment of reading a book. I would have given the book 5 stars but for all the errors, I do not think any author or editor should allow this to be passed on to customers.Having said that, I would love to read more about Josie, Archer and Hannah. I hope there are more books to follow in this series."
5,Book No. 3,I just finished the 3rd book in the witness series. Story within story line... it's a great book. Getting to know the charactors so well and I love it. Moving onto the 4th book in the seriex and am looking forward to it. These books are great... You'll enjoy them if you like legal thrillers. Ms Forester is a great author.
3,okay,"It is okay, the first 2 books were a lot better, slow reading some typo's in it. Over all not horrible"
4,Fast Read,"Consistent Forster style that enables the reader to visualize characters and scenes. This was a fast read that kept me interested. I was disappointed with the predictability of th ending. Overall, Forster fans will enjoy the book."
2,Very disappointing,"In the first novel of the witness series ""The Hostile Witness"" Josie the central character was so likeable with her ideal attributes like confidence, intelligence and determination. Cutting to the current novel (3rd one in the series) now she comes across as almost crazy, ever ready to get in to fight with everyone around her. There is a fine line between confidence and arrogance but Josie has crossed over to the dark side. You know you will not like the novel if you hate the central character and that's what happened to me. Save yourself some time by avoiding it."
5,Excellent Book.,"I am loving Rebecca Forster's books, they keep you in suspense and Priviledged Witness had an ending one could have never guessed."
4,Privileged Witness,The Witness Series (all 4) we very good. Rebecca Forster kept you in suspense throughout the entire books. Looking forward to reading more of her books.
5,Priviledge Witness,"Read all four books by Rebecca Forster.Read them in Order and you wil be glad you did. They are so good.She will keep you so interested in all the books.Hostile Witness, Silent Witness, Priviledged Witness and Expert Witness"
4,Bring on the 4th,Loving this series.Can't wait to see who the next intriguing client Josie Bates defends and what's in stall for Josie and Hanna.
3,"OK, but not great","I've read four books by Rebecca forester now. All have similar plots with changes to the names and settings. Leaves a lot of details open, but generally enjoyable."
2,Bad editing can ruin a book,"I have never read a book with so many errors. It got so distracting that I could hardly finish it. I had ready another of her books, Hostile Witness, and enjoyed it and didn't notice so many errors. But misspelled words, incorrectly placed words and punctuation, and repeats of words made it impossible for me to enjoy what appeared to be a pretty good story line."
2,Privileged Witness,If you like detective stories it was ok. Not a long book. To fill in a bit of time great.
5,REBECCA FORSTER GETS BETTER AND BETTER,"First let me say to go after the star rating of a book because of editing, please. Rate the book, question the editing. Rebecca Forster's Witness Series is on my favoritse list, so far three books read and each one has gotten better. PRIVILEGED WITNESS is an excellent story, keeps you guessing and Josie Baylor-Bates is a great character in the legal/courtroom gendre. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this book and the entire series. On to book four."
4,Great Series,I sure hope this isn't the end of the series. The characters are becoming family and am curious to see more of them. Great book. Formatting was great on Kindle.
4,A Good Book,Enjoyed the book a lot. A very good read. The writer keeps you interested from biginning to end. Will buy her again
2,Not as pleased with this witness novel as the others,"I enjoyed the first 2 novels in the witness series a lot. This one was kind of redundant and was all over the place. The book didn't seem to flow as the others did. The author established that Matthew and Josie had a history, but in the novel made it seem as this was something Archer should be threatened by but there were no lead ins to this. There were no clues or events given that illustrated that Matthew and Josie were interested in one another at the current time. The novel also was quite disjointed. A lot of the events happened with no suspense or details to lead up to it. All in all I did not enjoy this read as much as the first 2 novels in this series."
5,Keeps you guessing... Should be turned into a Lifetime Movie!,"This book was such a mystery. Every time i thought i knew what was going on and who did what, there was a change in direction. Kept me guessing. I liked how there were high profile people involved and i liked the fact that the main character had a history with him. GREAT BOOK Rebecca."
5,Very enjoyable fusion of traditional Indian folk melodies,"I heard Habib Khan live on New Years Eve and it was a lovely traditional sitar & tabla performance. Evening Light mellow fusions with western instruments based more in indian folk melodies. Overall this recording is inovative and unique. I recomend listening to the many choices available on his web site. He is an excellent musician and inovator, one of the best clasical Indian sitarist/musicians I have heard."
1,"Lacks clarity, gets lost in details","I use Plone a lot in my job and I bought both this book and The Definitive Guide to Plone by Andy Mc Kay.I find this book to be confusing at best, maybe because it tries to cover too much ground. When it describes the portlets, it goes on for SIX pages describing each portlet, with a screen capture for each portlet! It talks about REST for over a page, although this architecture has really nothing to do with Plone. Etc. Etc.All in all, it seems to me that too many technical editors have worked on this book, making it overly technical and complicated. Even the font they use make the content look cluttered!It is very difficult to write something clear and simple, especially for a very piece of technical software such as Plone. In my humble opinion, this book has failed in that regard.I almost never use this book on my everyday job. Get Andy Mc Kay's book, you'll get a much better value for your money."
1,review,"I bought this book together with another interviewing book (""Nail Your Law Job Interview"") as a gift for a friend's law school graduation. She thought this book offered very little practical advice and was a long and boring read. She really liked the other book though and felt it was much more useful. Having reviewed both of these books myself, I tend to agree with her. This book reads more like a personal bio than a practical guide. I don't think it's worth the money. But I would recommend buying ""Nail Your Law Job Interview"" - it was a fun read."
2,review,"Only read this book if you want to learn about the history of legal practice. It's written by person about his own experiences, and there is very little actual advice. I was dissapointed about how little, if anything, it taught me about interviews."
4,scooby doo doll,this doll is just what my granddaughter was wanting. thank you. the doll was more than i was expecting
2,tiny,"Although it lists how tall this toy is at 13"", it still looked very small to me, especially for the price of 19.99 plus shipping. I was a bit disappointed. The toy is very soft however, which is nice for cuddling."
1,A RIP OFF who advertizes for OTHER RIP-OFFS!,"This leads most people to think this is an audio CD, which, ofcourse it is not. Unless someone reads the opinions/reviews, they would never know the difference. furthermore, the site leads to you another site (at the top of their site) that advertizes for AUDIO that has a ""safety"" insignia at the bottom that looks like some sort of United States national seal. When you click on THAT, nothing comes up - just googles of SIMILAR stuff...which indicates another rip-off! ( TRY IT!)"
3,Confusing at times,"I had a hard time choosing between 2 and 3 stars for this book so I'm giving it a 2.5. The first part of Your Eyes in Stars wasn't bad. The characters were interesting, but I just didn't feel that wow factor. There were times when I was a little confused by the writing. I'm not really sure what Slater Carr had to do with the book. He could have been left out of the book completely and I don't think it would have hurt the story. I kind of felt like his part should have gone somewhere at least, but it just ends. To be honest, I probably would have given this a 2 star rating if not for part two. I wish the whole book would have been written in the form of letters. I couldn't put it down once I started reading that part. The ending left me feeling sad, but I'm glad I found out what eventually happened to Jess and Elisa."
1,What were they listening to?,"Hmmm, well, to each his/her own, I suppose. I purchased this record based on the four glowing recommendations, and on an interest in dub style music, but it's hard to believe that those four reviewers were listening to the same record. Frankly, I thought this sucked. One of the reviewers claims that these guys are top-notch musicians with an impressive resume of studio work, but none of that was in evidence here. To me, the songwriting was boring, the recording quality was poor, and the performances uneven. The drummer's attempt at double bass on one of the tracks was simply lame. It's an interest idea, I suppose, to blend ""punk"" with ""reggae dub,"" but when there are other and better examples of those styles at both ends of the spectrum, why waste your money on this?"
5,Reliable company,This product is exactly as advertised and the company is outstanding. I had a problem with an order and they made sure I was happy. Very reliable service and I will be sure to buy from them again.
1,Incorrect measures!,"The measures drawn on the cup are incorrect by 30ml, as can be seen by conducting a simple experiment:1. Fill in the cup up to 700ml2. Pour out 200ml to a separate vessel, so that this cup shows 500ml.3. Remove the 500ml from the cup.4. Pout back in the 200ml you have saved elsewhere.5. Ta-da! The measuring cup shows 220-230ml!This product is worse than useless, it will actually cause damage to your recipe!Returning my to Amazon, hopefully this faulty product gets removed from the market altogether."
4,good product,"It is a good product for the price. I was looking for awhile for a plastic one, since my kids have broken about ten of the glass ones. This is totally what I expected. If you want a plastic measuring cup this is as good as they come. It does all that is needed and is at a great price and with free shipping on top with my prime membership, you can't beat it."
2,"what good is a measuring cup, if the measuring labels come off?","I think my title says it all. I'm talking less than 2 years of frequent use, much of the red writing is coming off and illegible. Pay a little more and buy something decent. This is now only good for pouring water into the coffee machine."
1,should have packaged it better,"arrived cracked, should have just gone to the store for it and not ordered online, if they aren't going to package it nice why bother selling it??"
5,it's what it says it is,"it wasn't actually what i was hoping for, but it is was it says it is. works. easy to read. cleanable."
4,measuring cup,great cup and does wonders for all the measuring that a person does when they do cooking so good job
4,The Thrill is On in this Book,"I really don't read suspense and thriller books but, Ms Coleman, I really enjoyed this one. It was different and it keep me on wheels to find out the next unsolved mystery. It had it all, including the romance that I enjoy."
1,"""FAST FOOD"" READING","I would not recommend this book to any serious reader of thrillers/mysteries, or fiction. First, the subplot is much more interesting than the main plot. Further, the main character, Patricia Conley, is the least interesting and most unsympathetic (and pathetic) character in the story. In fact, this character is annoying. Throughout the book, she refers to her fiancee by both his first and last name. Who does that? In addition, the character makes sweeping statements that are unfounded and untrue. For example, Patricia Conley analogizes what she states to be black folks' universal disavowal of slavery with the guilt felt by rape victims! Ugh! Needless to say, the book was painful to read; but I stuck with it, only to be further disappointed with the book's final plot twist. The book would have been much better if the final plot twist had been left out. It was only until I read the final pages that I thought reading the book may have been a total waste of time."
2,Not what I expected,"This book was not what I expected. The heroine seemed very contrived. This book left a lot to be desired.While the story was interesting, the characters were not. The main character hardly appeared capable of functioning in the real (or unreal) world. I found it unbeleivable that she could solve a mystery much less figure that something was wrong."
5,"This is a thrilling, well-written, high-energy book!","As an African-American woman, I'm starving for books like this about smart black women. Coleman presents a variety of topics and issues in such an appealing way -- without lecturing. But this book should appeal to everyone because (and I don't know how she did it) it's original! As other reviewers noted, I also scold the publishers for making the book jacket look like yet another ""Waiting to Exhale"" novel. No gripe with Terry McMillian, but did the publishers read the book? African-Americans are not homogenous and aren't just focused on one issue. Read Coleman's book and you'll learn that. This book was great to read on the train. I had to slow down at the end because I didn't want to leave the main character. I also liked the action scenes (perhaps living vicariously?). I am WAITING for Coleman's next book."
1,Too Unrealistic,"I am a mystery fan, and this book did have a lot of surprises, but the author has a very vivid imagination. I know this is fiction, but everything about Patricia speaking to the grandfather was too ""out there"" for me. She mixed reality with fiction so much that I didn't know what was real - like is there really a Dogon tribe with the beliefs she talked about?"
2,I did not like this book.,"I thought that from the title and the cover that this would be a great book, full of action, mystery, suspense, with just a little romance. It was full of all that but none of it fit together into an enjoyable book. I finished it to see if the plot could get any sillier, and it did. I really thought that the heroin's personality was a bit all over the place. She was just as insane as the plot. It did have a few good points, but you may not want to waste your time finding them."
2,How Did This Book Get Published?,"Eve Coleman had this Woman going in too many directions. So much until you start to think that everything is taking place in year 3500, on some unknown planet. Outrageous! Two stars for the sistah's vivid imagination."
2,"Engaging, but Lacking","While this book kept my attention, and was engaging, I was surprised by the lack of consistency in one respect and very disappointed overall. The lack of consistency surfaced often in Ira Bernstein. For example, on page 316, Ira could not decide on whether it was the white race, or the vhite race. Whether it was William, or Villiam. I was disappointed because of the extent to which vulgarity was used. I look forward to the day when black authors,especially female black authors, will choose to refrain from using vulgarity and rely on their true God-given abilities to 'tell' a story."
1,Not Worth the Wait,"This complicated, well thought out mystery started out with a bang, but as soon as the main character started her long, dangerous journey to find out what happened to her boyfriend, it was downhill all the way. Though I admire Ms. Coleman's sense of humor and the knowledge she displays on the subjects she introduced, I found there to be too many twists and turns in the plot, thereby taking away from the enjoyment. Most of the book I found to be just plain BORING. The subject matter was one of interest, it just took much too long to get to the climax. The old adage ""I Love a Mystery"" just didn't apply here."
4,Unexpected Ending,"Nicolas Etheridge, prominent San Antonio tax attorney, is murdered. His staked out body is discovered within a few miles of THE HOUSE OF CORRECTION. During the investigation Terrell Newman, head of SA's Homicide Division, becomes aware of the BDSM community and some of its practices/practitioners. Newman must interview Edward Harrison, English expat who owns HC. During a tour of the buildings and grounds, Harrison explains some of the activities that take place at HC and some of the people involved.The journal of Nic Etheridge is used to explain his reasons for involving himself in BDSM and his desire to find a mistress. Miserable marriage. Hiding his real self behind a public image. It is an intersing way to explain a lot of detail without making it seem like a lot of detail.The endinging was not what I had expected."
5,"Fine 7th, buy it for Lemminkäinen","First a word about Saraste and Sibelius on other labels. The box set of the 1-7 is out of print, but worth looking up used.Saraste recorded those for Finlandia records and the individual tracks made it to other labels. The 7th is sold with the 3rd and 6th.This disc with the 7th is form his RCA recordings in Helsinki in 1989. Similar to Berglund recordings of that period. The recording is fine.But if you are a Saraste fan, you want to get this Lemminkäinen suite. There is no other recording. The suite runs some 50 minutes, the symphony about 20.Several other conductors have the Lemminkäinen suite. This is quite good. And the Swan of Tuonela is 2nd where it should be. Fine work by cellist and English horn player."
5,Loved it!,I was pleased with this product. It arrived in a very timely fashion and in great shape. My sister (for whom I bought it) uses it on a daily basis and loves it. Great work to all who had a part in this!
2,Very US - and not very EU,"Hmmm..a bit on the dull side. Although some funny numbers, the humour is somewhat sporadic. Also clearly targeted for the US listeners (not a hint of 'Monty Python-like' ga(g)s). The Xmas numbers are funny, although...The obvious 'soundeffects' are a bit monotomous..."
1,"if youre immature, this is for you","i have to admit, some of the farting noises and other disgusting things are kind of funny, they are best to be kept among you and your friends. if you love fart noises and other immature things like that, this cd is just what you need. otherwise, keep the perverted lines and fart noises with you and your friends."
4,Good so far so,Player is good doing what it is suppose to. Will decide if the XM service is really what I want by the time the three month trail is over.
2,Bad format of bad quality,"This video if it may be called that consists of a bunch of slides (photos) of rather poor quality. Since I viewed some pictures in PBS website of Hubble's photos I was excited at what I thought would be of the same fine quality. Boy was I wrong. There is no flow to this ""video"" and no audio background other than a choice of a few hot numbers to play while you click on the remote to get it to go to the next picture. Rather feeble."
5,Hart to Hart,I enjoyed this video as well as the other season dvd sets. I think Robert Wagoner and Stephanie Powers are terrific chemistry together. I liked them when the show was in real time and I enjoy it even more now. Ron
2,"Nice Pictures, poor diagrams of signs","I was very disappointed with this book. Although the photos of the animals are adorable, the accompanying sign for the animal is only 1""x1"" hardly big enough for an adult to learn from let alone a 2 year old. I realize this is a baby book, but I am teaching my son to sign and he learns from looking at the picture also."
2,It was nice while it lasted.,"I loved this belly jewelry. However, I wore it for a matter of a week and it fell apart. I guess you really do get what you pay for, and that isn't much."
5,The fastest growing team sport in America,"A Native American sport going back centuries, Lacrosse was introduced to Europeans and became on of the most popular sports world wide. It is currently the fastest growing team sport in America. ""Backyard Lacrosse"" is an instructional 38-minute DVD showcasing creative drills and fundamental techniques of interest to both novice and experienced lacrosse players. Each of these exercises can be down in an ordinary backyard, school playground, and either alone or with teammates. Appropriate for players ages 10 and older (especially the competitive high school player), ""Backyard Lacrosse"" covers stick control, scooping fundamentals, cradling, shooting techniques, creative drills, dodging, an equipment over view, and a wealth of practical tips that will enhance lacrosse player performance. ""Backyard Lacrosse"" is a strongly recommended addition to personal, school, community center, and community library Sports & Athletics instructional DVD collections."
1,Wait forever for your Photos,"If you are in no hurry for your pictures, like maybe two or three weeks, then this is the service for you. If you e-mail Ofoto to complain, then a non-specific autoserver will send you a cheerful message about how ""greater than expected"" usage is slowing down processing. After using the service, I would never trust them to process anything that I really cared about. If you upload your pictures, it's a little faster, but if you're on the east coast then there are much better services."
2,Wearily weird,2 1/2Organic electronica focusing more on instrumentation and composition doesn't sound as awkward as when FSOL went all Isness but unfortunately feels too indulgent to make its amazing parts last.
5,Awesome,"I am truly amazed at what Dan Snaith has put down. He is one brilliant man. Up In Flames may have been a rock meets electronica affair but Milk of Human Kindness is electronica that's got a bit of funk, folk and FM.This album starts off with a fast moving romp that will probably be the closest thing Dan will actually get to recording a dance track. If Madonna had done some experimental drugs when she was recording Ray of Light, it might have sounded like this. It then takes some bends and turns touching on 50's and 60's doo-wop, 70's funk, 80's hip-hop.... It's really a journey through a lot of musical styles. It puts a really interesting spin on the music as does his hypnotic Beck-like vocals.This is definitely one of the best this year. All the songs are great but the standout tracks are YETI, LORD LEOPARD, BEES, DRUMHELLER (a small town in the heart of the Alberta badlands where the dinosaurs roamed - very cool landscape up there) and PELICAN NARROWS."
5,memory upgrade,"The product doubled my laptop RAM, increased the speed with which I could access data and perform simultaneous functions. It was delivered quic kly at a reasonable price and performed as promised."
3,Works well but so so value,"HP LaserJet 13A (Q2613A) is one of two toners designed for HP LaserJet 1300-series. Although you can get a cheaper toner from 3rd party, doing so may void warranty and may even damage your printer. I can certainly understand the temptation though. The 13A is rated for 2500 pages (at 5% page coverage), which translates to higher than average printing cost.If you want better value, I suggest HP LaserJet 13X (Q2613X). While it costs about 20% more, it prints 37.5% more (4000 pages)."
5,Great Product,I needed toner so I purchase a refilled cartridge because it was very cheap and truly all I could afford. I wasn't sure what to expect but it shipped fast and it works perfect. Just as well as a brand new one. I am very happy.
1,Didn't use,I purchased this cartridge along with another one for another printer. The other cartridge was bad so I didn't even use this one. I'll never buy another recycled cartridge. The onther one left black smeared marks all over the page. I returned both cartridges to the seller and was taken care of very quickly. The seller helped me with my return.
5,REALLY TOUCHING,"I LOVE THIS ANIME, THE WHOLE STORY IS REALLY TOUCHING BUT THIS LAST DVD ARE THE MOST."
2,Practically Inaudible,"This is a live recording very badly done. It is a strain to hear what the actors are saying and the audience laughter doesn't help. I am amazed that American audiences laugh so heartily at what is wry or wistful humour.In the large box is ONE tape, costing $19.95.I shall not be interested in LA Theatre Works' productions in the future."
1,las vegas nexgen edge spot poker chip,"Not worth buying at all. Recived my chips and was extremely disappointed with the quality and color. First off i didn't even get what the picture shows, instead these uglier designs. These chips are so light and absolutely do not have any authentic sound or feel. Just feels like old plastic."
2,Warning label on goggles!,"My 9 year old twins and I opened up our set today. There are a lot of instructions to read. This is not something that children can do on their own, it was a lot of watching mommy handle the chemicals and boiling water. The thing that disturbs me most is the protective goggles included with the set. My son pointed out the warning label on them which reads ""WARNING! This is a toy. Does not provide protection."""
4,Kids enjoyed it.... many laughs.,"Watched with the kids (10 yol daughter, 6 yol son). They were entertained. Lots of luaghs,... they seemed amazed at the impossible and silly situations..... It's a fun fantasy kids movie.There's not much in the ""special features"" of the DVD. Only a trailer of the movie itself, and ""Behind the scenes"". You can also turn on/off english subtitling.Possible spoiler alert:....... The ""Monster Mutt"" does not look very realistic,... a bit like a puppet,... made me think a of the big flying dog-like animal in Never Ending Story (tough funier and with lots more energy),... but still good and fun. Perhaps the fact that it's not 100% realisitc even helped with my kids enjoying this movie. Especially my 6 year old. He could relate that it's just ""silly and impossible""."
5,Enjoyed it thoroughly for what it was!!! Just go with it...,"I watched this with my 11yr old son and some of his friends. Was the monster dog realistic looking? No, but who cares, it was a fun movie to watch with the kids."
2,A REAL DOG,MONSTER MUTT looks like a movie from the 60's--from its by the numbers plot to its horrible acting and its laughable monster dog effects.Small children might get a few chuckles but sane adults will cringe and find something else to do while the kids watch.I watched the whole thing just to see how bad it was gonna get. MONSTER MUTT is just a really bad movie!
3,"Watch ok, Band stinks","I have owned 2 of these watches, the watches are good, the bands are not. The band on my 1st watch broke about a year after I bought it. No one I can find could repair or replace the band. I would have to ship it to Seiko, I thought I got a fluke, so I bought another just like it, again watck ok, band loose on 1 end and the small metal catches on the band stick into your wrist, think I'll try another brand."
2,Better to stick to the original Holmes stories,"The story was disappointing. Holmes goes afterJack the Ripper but the ending left much to bedesired. To avoid spoiling the story, I won'tsay how the ending turned out but it was absolutely unsurprising and anticlimatic."
3,Very Interesting,"The story was very interesting. It showed an aspect of Holmes that had not been explored much before, failure. The author apparently did much research in order to make the atory realistic and exciting. I recommend not to read this late at night. At times the story was very detailed. This is a book that any Sherlockian should read, either to criticize or to enjoy."
5,still one of the best,"Had Munch recorded a Brahms third symphony to match his versions of the other three, the cycle would have been one of the best. This second symphony is attuned to the lyrical,pastoral qualities in it, especially in the first three movements. Opus 73breathes the same air as the opus 77 Violin Concerto, especially its first two movements. Munch does not dawdle or rush, even in the cyclonic fourth movement, maintaining balance and clarity amid the storm. The BSO is superb here as well as in the moredour Tragic Overture.Competition is fierce for the symphony. My favorite version that of Karl Bohm (BPO/DG). Also Szell/Sony, Jochum/DG and EMI,and Klemperer/EMI, and Carlos Kleiber/VPO/DG. But Munch is definite a peer"
4,If you want history and great recipes........,"This was my first Jessica Harris cookbook, but I now own all of them. In the early 90's it was not so common to include history as precursor to a recipe, but it has always been her style. A great beginning cookbook which embraces the African Diaspora."
4,deeetroit!,"those planet e cats! Mike Clark did a good stop mixing, but that last track had no binness being up in this piece. all and all, it made for good listening..."
4,PS2 (new design) primary home DVD player? Not yet.,Love the fact that it's so small and portable. Plus the built in ethernet ports (the 1st generation required you buy the adapter).My only complaint is the DVD player function. This model still has trouble with lightly scratched DVDs. DVDs that play just fine in my 2001 DVD player.I thought by now the second generation PS2 would've worked out all the playback bugs.Looks like we can't retire our old DVD players just yet...
3,slim PS2 keeps on freezing in middle of gameplay...,"I play FIFA soccer often on my new PS2 and every now and then, the game freezes. I think ToysRUs gave me a defective model. I don't know if other users of the slim PS2 experience the freezing problem"
2,"Cute , But Heats up Fast & Long..","It almost melts your games if you play over an hour! Maybe I got a ""refurbished"" sold as brand new from EB Games, I dunno, mine worries me while i'm playing it! Kinda sorry I sold my old ps2..."
3,THE BLUE DISK CONTINUED.....................,The reason im giving this platform 3 stars is beacause it will play the gold colered disks flawlessly but the blue ones EVEN IF THERE BRAND NEW IT SIMPLY CANT PLAY THEM THIS IS WHY I BOUGT A NEW PS2 BECAUSE I HAD THE SAME PROBLEM WITH MY LAST ONE AND THIS NEW ONES NOT EVEN A YEAR OLD THERE MUST BE A FLAW IN THE SYTEM AND I AM NOT RUFF WITH THE SYTEM ONCE AGAIN DOES ANYONE KNOW HOW TO CORRECT THIS!!!???!!!???!!those dreaded blue disks.........
4,Ps2 Slim is way better then Ps2 but still cannot beat xbox,"If u want a ps2 u should get this but if ur new to gamming u should first get an XBOX, i just bought a ps2 for Final Fantasy! Sony has really over priced there ps2!"
5,ps2 rocks but why get the small ps2 If you have a regulerps2,for people out there who already have a ps2 (like me)you shouldn't get the new slim one becase it dousn't have any new capeability's its just smaller but for those who dont have ps2's you really should get one (get the small one or wait for a new sony product sony's the best!!)trust me if you buy a ps2 you won't regret it ps2 has the best grafics everthanks sony you built a realllllllllllly great product sony's #1!!!!
2,Out of stock all over. Buy the XBOX!,"They release this thing at Christmas and can't even put enough in the stores to keep shelves stocked. True it's a a good system but it's the same thing in a new package. Do yourself a favor. When you get the OUT OF STOCK message, buy an XBOX it's a technically better system. The games always perform and look better on the xbox, and yes it has plenty of great no stop titles. PS2, NO FABLE, DOOM 3, Knights of the Old Republic, or HALO for you.Also look out for price gouging on the shops that still have it in stock."
1,Piece of Junk,If you buy a new Playstation 2 you are asking for it. Nothing but read errors. You are better off with an X Box. They look better and come with more features none being disk read errors. Seriously the PS2 is a real piece of crap.
1,Xbox 360 will blow it out of the water,"the Playstation line of consoles have been sitting comfortably atop the console charts for almost 10 years. PS2 accounts for 43% of current console sales. but there is a new preditor closing in on them, known as xbox 360. ign.com compared the ps3 power with the xbox 360 power and have found that the xbox 360 is actually more powerful overall. yes, there are some dimensions of the ps3 that beat out the 360, but the 360 wins overall. but power isnt everything, right? just to make a mockery of sony's new console, microsoft plans to release Halo 3 for Xbox 360 on or around ps3's release date. there are also tons of other good games coming exclusively to xbox 360, and almost all of the good ps3 ones are going to be available for the 360 also. and there is no way on earth that sony can ever hope to match up to Xbox Live when it comes to online play. man-oh-barry manillow, i cant wait for xbox 360 to come out."
1,The Wrong System at the Wrong Time,"Shouldn't Sony be focusing on the PS2? Since they are diverting their resources to the PSTwo, the PS2 must be throwing in the towel."
1,Don't buy the Chumpstation 2!!,"Xbox is for the serious gamers. If you like crappy graphics, horrible online play, and little kid games like Rachet and Clink, Spongebob Squarepants, and Crash Bandicoot then my all means buy the Chumpstation. If you are a serious gamer and like your unit with its own memory that you can download music to, online play that is insane, amazing graphics, more serious and adult games like Halo and Mechassualt then buy the XboxChumpstation 2 - Ages 4 - 9 yrs oldXbox - Ages 10 and over"
5,Totaly Awesome,The PS2 no matter how bad the reviews are this is the BEST system.DVD PlayerAwesome Graphics (don't listen to anyone who says they are bad)Wide selection of gamesDO NOT BUY AN XBOX they are the worstI HATE MICROSOFT
2,Doesn't always work,Me and my brother have had the original PS2 for a while and if you play silver games (Ones that are silver on the bottom) a lot and than you try to play a blue game it says disk read error. I really enjoy ps2 but be careful in buying games.
2,Mr,HELLO POEPLE I HERE TO BUY A COMPUTER GAME IN THE CREDIT CARD HOW CAN I SEE THE PLACE THAT POEPLE CAN BUY IT.
1,POS!!!!,"this is overall the worst playstation ever made. Suprisingly, the first one i got was for my bday and it broke on me. then the second one i got was even worse. after the day i got it, it wouldnt even go on. at least the first one actually worked for some time now. anyway, if u are a true gamer, then u can take ur chances and get it. however, if ur only getting it just cause its new, dont get it. waste of money"
4,Nice,My original PS2 stopped working. I replaced it with this one and love the slim design. I had no problems with it. I actually hooked it into a portable dvd player to play on the road why traveling (not while I was driving). I like it much better than the original.
4,"Good System, Tired of Lies","I am tired of hearing people saying this ps2 has no fan. It does. It has an internal fan. I have had no problems out of it. I can sit and play gta san andreas and not have to worry about over heating. So if u don't have one, and u have that old piece of crap ps2. Don't judge this one"
5,Multitap,"I already had a playstation 2, however I bought the newer version with the slimer design. I love it. What I do not love, is the fact that even though I know that my old Multitap will not work on this one, I cannot find the new one that will operate on this system anywhere. I have went to Major retailers looking for the new Multitap and no one has them. Just the old ones. Needless to say, if your are going to sell a product that requires a new Multitap, then you should make that Multitap available to the public. I wish now that I would have just kept the old one, or bought an x-box."
1,BEWARE OF BAD GAME COMPATABLITY!!,"I just recently purchased a Playstation2 in the 70000 series and after purchasing games and bringing them home, I found out that they do not work. After exchanging them, thinking the disks were bad, I was about to have the lens on the system professionally cleaned, when I though I would hop on the sony playstation website and see what customer service reccomends. I found there a list of 44 games that are not reading/working properly on the new redesigned systems- Several of which were made by Sony themselves!! On top of that, I have also experienced problems with the console not recognizing the blue-back disks. Although there are some games that work without problems, and the system is smaller, I see no benefit to purchasing this console. I was outraged when I found out that I cannot return the system or games, and Sony is not concerned about the malfunctioning console. SAVE YOUR MONEY!"
5,"Nice, but it still depends","I'm now NOT competeing with the next generation or else this system would clearly be blowned away as last place. For PS2's generation, it all depends on taste. PS2 is the weakest system of the big 3. However is tpyically the favorite for RPG type of players. Xbox...., I don't know other than Halo. Gamecube to be all honest was somewhat of a dissapointment since the games were not as good as N64 and so far, not as good as the unreleased Nin Rev. Regardless, GC still has better games than Xbox (Metroid Prime, Pikmin, Mario Sunshine, Zelda, Super Smash B M). Playstation has the largest library due to the fact that it is backward compatible with PS1. I personally have a GC, but I know PS2 well enough."
4,It's pretty good but...,"My dad bought this system when it first came out. (he let somebody borrow his PS1 and it got dropped down the stairs when he was taking it home. So he just bought the 'new' PS2.)I's a pretty good system. But the games are bring or just hard to play. Sometimes, you could only play from certain angles and I personally find some of the PS1 games more fun such as some of the boardgames released on PS1.(Monopoly,LIFE?) Or Gran Turismo. Those were fun games. But the only few games I have found entertaining were The Simpsons: Road Rage and The Sims Bustin' Out. But some of this systems games are just boring. Either way, I am getting a Gamecube and just letting my sisters have the PS2. So I end saying this: Playstation 2 is good but not great."
3,comparing (three stars for graphics),PS2 has vary bad grapgics.If you are planning on getting one then you should try it out first.XBOX has awesome graphics I know this cause I have an XBOX.If you want to play online with ps2 then you better check the monthly price witch is $26 a month.But if you like cheap stuff then think of XBOX live $6 a month or $70 a year.Really XBOX is better buy the graphics and online.Oh did I mention that Xbox can download music.I'm 13 years old
1,BOOOOO,I got one cause my old 1 died and it was smaller than a sheet of paper It had no HDD bay to play online and messed with the gameplay of my games I say booo because no HDD bay no HDD bay means no more online play they tried to replace it with ethernet all that does is browse the net wich im doing now :P to you sony
3,It's Getting Old,"You know Sony's in trouble when they start making a smaller console for more money and still keep it at the same overpriced $150. At that price you could buy a Nintendo Gamecube which far beats the next PS2 and add a great game, or you could buy just a Xbox because either way it's better then the new PS2. Sony just needs to give up they've sold tons of consoles and are easily the winner of the console wars but now that no one wants the PS2 Sony is trying to think of stupid ideas for some more money. Buy a old used PS2 anyways cause you'll get it 10 times cheaper."
1,Should Have Been Free!!,Sony thinks that they can make up for the PS2s short-comings by releasing a new one right before the next-gen consoles are released?! This should have been exchanged for all of the old PS2s cause they break the DAY after the warranty finishes. Sony has lost yet another customer. Save your cash for the Xbox 360.
1,simply defective,this machine is simply defective ive got three brand new games sitting here its a 4 month old machine 4 months!!!i think it may be the fact that there all blue. because ive got 2 other silver games that work fine on it my freinds machine wont play the blue ones they should put on the of the case WARNING THIS DISK IS BLUE it has to be defective wich pretty much means i wasted 125 dollers on those games and they just wont play so decide for yourself.
3,How did I see this one coming...,"Ok Sony, you and I and they rest of your customers know that we really don't give a darn about your compact console. All everyone cars about is PS3. The only reason why people bought the PSOne is because the Play Station was crappy looking and the change was kind of refreshing. It was also $99.99; not bad. But, not only did you waste your time designing it, you over-priced it! I doubt this was good for business because supply seems about 50x more than demand. Look at Nintendo. They made their console (even their discs) small from the beginning. Microsoft better not try anything dumb, because by the time you're done paying for the system, the DVD compatibility, and XBOX Live, not to mention games, needless to say you've lost a few pounds in the hip area. Basically, Sony hasn't made many bad descisions, I guess they were over-due."
2,I was a fan of you,"Sony, i was a fan of your ps2. but now for some reason you sold a lot of your great games to microsoft xbox. Maybe you're going out of buisness or something who knows. Sony sold their entire grand theft auto series to xbox, and their max payne series to xbox. So now xbox has grand theft auto, max payne plus halo and halo 2 and half life."
2,maybe the ps3 will work better,first of all i think this sytem is very fun two play but im now on my third one in 2 years and im now starting two have trouble with this one as well and its about 3 months old my to preaveous sytems were the old model and they stoped reading disks so i heard this one would be better but now its starting to break i bought this last one beacase i enjoy playing these ps2 games (i now have 23)wich is why i bought this one because i think its a fun system to play and im gentle with them but its defective and i have read alot of reveiws that are saying the same thing so this will probably be the last one i buy so maybe theyll build the ps3 to last longer also there are alot of reviews saying the game cube is bad well at least it is reliable weve had the same one since its realease so lets hope the ps3 is more of a qaulity pruduct
1,Slim Twos....Don't buy!,"Hello,I do not recommend this product. The new PSTwos, the SLim Twos have problems. If you read the info about this product throughtout the Internet, you will see the Slim Twos have probelms with laser going out and over heating problems. This product will have problems, even if you modify the console with or without a MOD Chip. As for now, there are not hard drive support. I heard they are working on a USB to external hard drive but the communication and transfer rate is very slow.If I were you, I would go back to the last BIG version of the Playstation, v9 or v10."
1,Not Enough Ram,I wish I had done my homework before purchasing this system. It has half the ram of an regular xbox console. Game performance was slow. Navigating was slow. Size is great. It will fit anywhere.
4,To Buy? or Not Buy?,"I bought this for my kids for christmas and they love it. Although, my nephew, who works for sony, told me that they will release the new Playstation Five. (PSX, PSONE, PS2, PSTwo, and PS5) I thought over it and thought, ""When is the PS5 coming out,"" so, I bought the PSTwo. I'm glad I did."
1,Bad deal,"In my country I could buy a console with a higher number (modern), but you send me one a little OLD. So, this console get burn !!!. I did not return this item because is very expensive for me, I live in Costa Rica."
4,ps2,"The ps2 slim is better than the original in that it operates a little faster, it's more space efficient, and it has the upgrades, such as the IR port for remote control access, and all that. It seems a little frail if standing on its side with a stand, but there are other aftermarket stands for horizontal and verticle that make it more sturdy. I used wireless controllers, so I didn't worry about cords pulling the unit off the stand."
2,Good Design bad Deal,Now I like this new design and it seems very cool but I have a network adaptor and a multitap and now I have to go out and buy a new multitap because my multitap doesn't fit the new design. Do not buy this if you have a multitap and you like to use your multitap otherwise you will be out buying snaller multitaps and possibly smaller controllers depending on the controller you have. You may want this so bad but it is not the best thing it is still a ps2 just a smaller design.
4,Great new PS2,"This new and redesigned ps2 is awesome. It has the great features of the first ps2 but it is extremely smaller and has a built in internet modem/ethernet port thing. trust me, it is really tiny and easy to transport. I got GTA San Andreas with it so far and it is so cool. Anyway, if you are thinking about getting the slim ps2 I strongly suggest that you do, you won't regret it. Below I have listed pros and a couple of cons:Pros:1. Very small and lightweight2. More games than xbox and gamecube, possibly more games than xbox and gamecube combined3.excellent graphics4. Disc holder can be opened with system turned off5. DVD playerCons:1. In order to use multiplayer, you have to buy a multitap adapter which costs about $20-$252. No built in memory like xbox3. No Halo games"
3,remember ps one?,"We all remember the ps one right? It was way smaller, way quieter, not as near as ugly, and cost like 150 or 100. Every kid's grandmother bought them one, yet the ps2 was around in full swing, and fully backwards compatible. This is sony's chance to perhaps correct the mistakes they have had with their lazer eyes, that have plagued many of our ps2's, and make some more ps2 bucks. Well mine will last for another year, with some tweaking I did, until the ps3 comes out. It is 200 times as fast as the ps2, backward compatible, and if you wait a little longer they are coming out with a full programming version, that should be able to do anything your pc does, with a linux operating system. In a year the ""new"" ps2 will be in pawn shops for 50 bucks. I can't remember the site I saw on the ps3, but any common search engine should find you something. Patience is a virtue. Xbox watch out."
3,Well I know it's compact..,"I'm sure that you all probably like the smaller, slimmer version of this Console system, but I am a little reculant with it, I got this for Easter, at first I was afraid of it being easy to break, trust me, it feels like it can break easily...I like the bigger one better, it's more sturdy! And but I do like the fact that the disc doors Wwill NEVER malfunction.. That was really annoying, whenever I opened the disc on the bulkier one, it'd close if I tapped it jsut lightly..And the discs never have any more errors now.. A good fact about this.. But I don't like the cords.. They get burnt out after six months..Well I really just feel safer with the bigger one since it's harder to break in half."
3,The blue disk...........................,First of all my plastation is about 8 monthes old nowyou go to pick up a new game you bring it home and your itching to play it you open it up and..........GOOD LORD!!!!! ITS A BLUE DISK U TRY HOPING IT MAY STILL work than those unholy words disk read error pops up it ticks me off does anyone know how to correct this PROBLEM!!????
4,Playstation 2...,"The new sleek design is unbelievable. The unit fits into the smallest of spaces and weighs next to nothing!However the power adapter is a little bulky, but I guess that could not be avoided.The improved game startup and loading speeds are also a plus. No problems so far.Good product."
3,ps2 not as advertised buyer beware,did not send what was advertised poor customer service was supposed to be a ps2 with a modem port but they sent broadband only. I tried to work it out with there dismal customer service even told them the model numbers that have a modem port. All they said was they could not specify what model to ship from their distribution center and that it would be hit or miss as to whether I would get the right one. I will never do business with that company again. It would have been a simple thing to call their warehouse or even attach a message with the shipping address to make sure i got the right part but like I said the customer service was almost non existent . In the end I got my money back. I ended up buying one somewhere else and it works great Can even play online now that I have the right one with a modem port
5,Excellent Buy,I am definately impressed with the new model PS2. There are a few comprimises like no more hard drive support but it makes up with its portibility and performance. I used to have plenty of trouble lugging my old model ps2 around but now in since this model came out that is no longer a problem. The new model still has all the features of the original (Well almost) and can still perform just as well. This model can still acheive high frame rates and offer you its DVD playing capabilities while being as portable as a GameCube. Also sony's massive third party game support makes this a system for all ages with more titles than Gamecube or XBox.
3,Great game system but get older version,"The playstation 2 system has been around since October 2000. When it first came out, it had a motorized tray to put the disc in and it also had a cooling fan (which is a good thing to have). The new version of the PS2 which came out in November 2004 is slimmer yes but doesn't have the two options listed above. It's a lot less durable and it heats up A LOT faster! My friend has one and after playing it only 2 hours, the bottom is really hot. Anyone who knows anything about electronics knows that heat is not the best thing for electrica parts. In most cities that have used video game stores, most stores sell the older PS2 systems for around $100. I'd hightly recommend buying one of those as opposed to the new version. You can't beat an original!"
1,ive had it with this!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,Well ive been playing the ps2 for a while now and im DONE i finally got my hands on a game that ive been looking for and long behold you guessed it it was BLUE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!SURE U CAN try and adjust the laser if u want to break it u cant ask to open a game before u buy it they wont let and it seems like more disks are being made blue so stay away from this.
1,Final Fantasy XI/Hardrive,Playstation 2 is a nice system more slime design and all the other stuff that comes with it. The problem is for people who has the old system and have the Hard Drive for it to save games on and play final fantasy XI but with the new design there is no place to put the harddrive now why is the reason for that is it because sony doesnt want a hardrive anymore. Well who knows other than that it is a nice system.
5,Savage Frontier,This book is a great book just to read for pleasure. If you are into Texas genealogy it is even better.
2,Portable but not very responsive,"This item was purchased for me by my former employer for ergonomic reasons. The keypad is versatile to be on either side of a keyboard but the keys are not very responsive. As it turns out, I end up having to rekey (more often than not) numbers because the initial keying doesn't register. This adds to more reptitive motions due to the rekeying of numbers. Not sure of why, but I'm about to give up on using this thing and return to a regular keyboard. Their articulated keyboard is very good."
5,i have bought several copies of this tape for friends,"the minute i heard it i loved it and responded to it. dr. estes weaves myth together with her sharp insights about people, the soul, conflict and creativity and makes an irresistible tape about what drives us. she views creativity as a life force and her stories about it take this point of view, which she explains convincingly and with passion.i have been thoroughly inspired by this work and i recommend it to everyone, no matter who you are or what you do."
5,Pure Joy,"This set of discs, no matter how often one listens, brings the pure joy and excitement that contact with the soul always brings. Clarissa Pinkola Estes is not only a master story-teller and a trained Jungian scholar with a beautiful voice, but she is KIND, and the kindness comes through in her work. A must-have. It makes one delighted to be alive!"
3,Getting out of the way,"This is a wonderful collection of storys that will help you understand where your creativity goes and how to get out of the way and let it flow naturally! A wonderful book, I got it in audio form, so I can listen to the storys over again as I worked in my studio."
2,Visioneer 9220 Scanner with paperport,"All I can say is ""Buyer Beware"". The system requirements list Windows XP, however the driver and paperport software do not run under Windows XP Service Pack 2. New computers now come with SP2 and anyone using Microsoft's automatic updates has probably been updated to SP2. Visioneer makes no mention of this in their product information and you really have to dig through their knowledge base to find out the scanner will not work with your system, once you've already bought it and the software fails to install. What a disappointment. Visioneer recommends that you uninstall Service Pack 2 and completely uninstall the paperport software. After you do that and if you still have a viable operating system, the scanner software will install and work."
2,PERFORMANCE DETERIORATED,"My 9220 replaced an earlier model 6200, but was never as good. The higher speed scan was at the expense of quality and I had to bump DPI settings way up to 400 to get legible scans. As the machine aged, the scans got fainter, so I had to change to gray scale to be able to read printed docs and invoices after scanning. Then the color gave up and produced only garish reds in the scan. If it was a color printer I'd say that the black cartridge was empty!We need a photo scanner and this one can't produce a usable color copy. I like the PaperPort software and will be looking for a compatible TWAIN scanner to use it with. Maybe Canon."

1,Faulty Dual Pack,"I will warn purchasers that I just opened the following dual pack: 2: Brand New (6000 Page Yield/ea) HP Q2610A, 10A, Q2610X Compatible Laser toner cartridge for Laserjet 2300, 2300D, 2300DN, 2300DTN,2300L, 2300N, Black Color, 2 Packs total 12,000 Page Yield. ONLY SOLD BY: Best Deal Toner (Purchased on 08/26/2009)The delivery actually states JP Quality, Indianapolis, IN1. The original shipment was lost, and a replacement order was several days late being delivered.2. I had to order a third cartridge from a retail store to serve while waiting for re-delivery. (worked perfectly for 5 months)3. Both cartridges are faulty, one had grey marks moving over the paper, and the other one the spring on the arm that moves the cover fell off before I even removed the toner tape.We are out the purchase price, and according to Amazon's policy I can't get my money back so many months after purchase."
4,Lasts a long time,"These cartridges aren't cheap, but give great printout for a long, long time. I do mostly duplex (2-sided) printing, and the results are clear and sharp."
5,great,The toner is great and it lasts a long time. We are a busy law office and we do a lot of printing and we really dont have to change it that often.
1,Watch price increases,"Just witnessed what's been in the media of late, that e-sellers increase an item's price when a potential buyer returns to view the item. In my case, it was the third view.Needless to say, no purchase.Consumer beware!!"
1,Defective Product,Sorry but this cartridge does not work. It leaves dark smudges when printing. Disapointed and would like my money back or a replacement.Philippe
3,Too short and uninvolving,"This book racks in at 72 pages, but it starts on page 6, and 25 of the remaining 66 pages are illustrations. That turns this book into a 40 page book. The art is excellent, up to Dorman's standards, creepy, photorealistic, and lots of fun to look at. But the writing leaves a lot to be desired. Overlong senteces and too many big words obscure some really neat scenes. The story's pretty good, though, and it introduces the idea of a ""berserker"" unit that will be brought back later in Perry's novel. This book is a neat addition to the Aliens series, it just costs too much for too little content."
5,Excellent writing with even better art work.,"The writing on this graphic novel/book is very good, and the artwork is some of the best I have ever seen."
5,DVD-RAM PURCHASE,"An easy purchase with timely delivery. No problems and no surpises. Unless this product becomes available locally(backwards South Texas), I will buy from this company again."
5,High Quality,"I've only used these Panasonic DVD-RAM discs for about 2 weeks but the quality is unsurpased. They are flawless and crystal clear for recording TV, erasing, and re-recording. I will purchase nothing but this brand from now on."
1,Disapointed in product,"I was led to believe that this item would play on most any DVD player after recording----This is false, it will only play on the one that records it---I have three other players in my home and in my RV and none of these will recognize the RAM disc----I am very disapointed......"
4,Excellent Product,"I've transferred video from my Toshiba recorder to my Panasonic recorder many times and had very few problems. Unlike a DVD-R you don't have to finalize the disc. I'm surprised this product is no longer sold in major stores such as Best Buy, Sears or Radio Shack."
5,Panasonic DVD-RAM Discs,"This is a great product which stores tons of data. This one box should last me the rest of my life. Now if I can get my wife to switch from using VCR tapes to the discs, I would be set."
5,Ram disks as agreed,I have used Panasonic RAM disks for years to convert my DVR into a poor man's Tivo. These disks make that possible and economically too.
5,Couldn't find them anywhere else,"I guess this item is going to be discontinued????? I couldn't find them at the usual locations, but there they were on Amazon.com!Thanks!"
4,Good Enough,Bought this for a Panasonic DVD recorder. It was supposed to let me record 8 hours but it doesn't. Not the fault of the DVD - but Panasonic.
3,2princessesmom,"I bought one of these cameras for each of my girls. I gotta say ya get what cha pay for. There is no flash, so unless you are in extra bright light-all the photos come out blurry or too dark to distinguish what they are. It is all manual frame advancing, winding up the roll of film after it's finished with that tiny crank-BLAH!!!I previously had a Strawberry Shortcake camera for my then 4 year old-that one was about the same price but at least it came with a flash-although it did not last long either as you can tell from my getting her this one eh??? Cute, but I really would not recommend you waste your time, money or your last nerve on this product."
2,Needs a Flash!,"My daughter recv'd this camera set as a Christmas gift. She was so excited. It is a very cute girly camera. BUT...it is a manual 35mm camera, which means you have to have to manually rewind the film when the pictures have all been taken. It was annoying. My daughter had a blast taking all of her ""own"" photos. The camera does not have a flash. We took them in for development...and to our disapointment...they were all dark. We couldn't even make out who the people were! WASTE of money!!! I know the camera is cheap...but film and developing are not. Buy a REAL camera w/ a flash for REAL pictures."
2,Arrived torn.,"I got this to use as a ball pit, but it was far too small. I think it would be too small as a pool for a baby to play in as well. It also arrived torn, I used the patch and it seemed to work-at least for the few hours I tried it before I sent it back."
2,you get what you pay for...,This pool looks like something from the dollar store.. I can't seem to inflate it round as in the picture...
1,too small and doesn't blow up round,"i purchased this for my 14 month old. it is very small (he can sit in it, but only with his legs bent), and when blown up, it creases in several places creating a strangely lopsided hexagon. also, the plastic smell was so strong! it made my throat hurt. don't waste your time or money."
4,Intex My First Pool,"Bought this for my Great-Grandson. It really was his first pool and at 1 1/2 he really enjoyed it. Fortunately, it's not too expensive because it really only lasts for one season. But now he's ready for a bigger pool, so that's okay."
2,toddler tub for shower,"bought pool for granddaughter to use as a tub in shower. this pool was not as durable as one bought from Walmart. However, WM doesn't carry the pool any more. Had a puncture after one month's use."
4,Great pool for a little one,"Great pool for a little one. Its not very deep, but I didn't want that anyways. It's just enough for my little guy to splash around in."
3,OK for the price,"While I can't complain about the great price on this sheet set (less than $30 for a king-sized set) I can't really gush about the softness of the set given that it's supposed to be 500 thread count. It's not horribly uncomfortable but it certainly doesn't even remotely approach the kind of quality I would expect with this high of a thread count. Even after washing the sheets feel stiff and almost a bit scratchy. But you get what you pay for. If I'd paid what is listed as ""retail price"" for this set I'd certainly be upset but like I said, less than $30 is a reasonable price for these sheets."
2,Could be much softer,I have lower thread-count sheets that are much softer than these. They are very 'loud' - like rolling around on paper.
4,Nice sheets,Nice sheets. Still soft after a few washes. I need to rest on them some more before my final review.
2,Not high quality,"I own a set of 400 thread count sheets from Wamsutta and LOVE them, but haven't bought another set because they are pretty expensive. I thought I was getting a great deal with this set, but when I received them they were rough, and much thinner then my current set. I'm sending them back. They are not worth the price even if they are inexpensive."
4,still a good deal,"The sheet set is much softer than other 500 ct sets I've bought previously. They get even softer after washing. My only complaint is that the pillowcases are too short. I have standard pillows, but the pillowcases barely cover them. However, the price is unbeatable. I'd buy them again. Kohl's had 500 ct queen sets at 50% off and they're still twice the price of these sets."
1,Scratchy and unpleasant,"i seem to have gotten different sheets from every other reviewer on here! i wish i could say i loved these sheets, as they were SO pretty and white. but alas... after i washed and dried them, i found them crispy and uncomfortable. i didn't try to send them back, but gave them to a friend for her guest bed. oh well!"
2,These sheets are not that great.,"Perhaps when we ordered these sheets, Amazon sent us a different set than they've been sending everyone else who describes these as comfortable and soft.That's not true, of course. The truth is that these sheets just aren't that great. They're scratchy, they're noisy when you roll around on them. We have lower thread-count sheets (that we paid more for, mind you) that are of much higher quality than these.I gave them two stars because they fit very well. But a good fit does not a comfortable sheet make.Not recommended."
3,Pillow cases too short,"The sheets are great - but the pillow cases are 18 3/4 W by 25""L. I measured the other great sheets I bought at Amazon, Divatex 420 ct they were 21 x 31 1/2 W thats 6 inches longer over 2"" wider- and $15 cheaper and they are very soft -great sheet for price and great size pillow cases. These sheets are great but these little pillow cases I won't use - can't too short for my pillows - which are just standard pillows. Sheets are a 5 star but pillow cases are a 1 star. As usual - Amazon was quick with shipping - Amazon is the place to shop."
3,Doesn't Feel Like 500 TC Sateen Sheets,"These sheets are good for the money, but truthfully, my 250 tc from Target are much softer. These sheets are well tailored and don't shrink much after washings, but are more crisp than soft. Yes, if you purchased 500 tc sateen sheets from a retail store you would pay three times this price, but you would also find a world of difference in the softness. This is the third (and last) time I will purchase sheets online because of the 'good deal' I thought I would be getting. If you have ever had 500 tc sateen sheets before, don't expect these to feel the same."
2,wrinkles galore,"They feel great but I have never seen such tight, set in wrinkles in anything coming out of the dryer...Hoping as they get older they will wrinkle less."
4,good quality sheets,"I bought this set of sheets when they were offered on the Friday Sale for $29.99 for King size. I had never seen sheets with 500 thread count at such a bargain price before. Even though I have a Cal King bed, the regular King size set fits pretty good (that was all they had available). The sheets felt very smooth compared to other sheets when new. After washing, they didn't have quite the same silky smoothness, but they are 100% cotton and I expect they will just get softer the more I wash them. As with most 100% cotton sheets, they can wrinkle in the dryer. I usually dry by hanging on the line--good breeze will ""iron"" them nicely."
2,Deep pockets but....,I just washed my new sheets and yes I have a top and bottom sheet and two pillow cases and the pockets depth is fantastic just what my new mattress needed but.... hmmmmm where did the sateen go? (they did feel sateeny just before I washed them.. soft too) Why do they now feel like the thread count is 200 not 500? They don't feel really scratchy but they don't feel soft either :( The adage is true.. you get what you pay for! Pay more and get what you really want....soft sateeny sheets...don't buy these unless all you're concered with is the depth of the pockets.
5,For the cost - Great Value,"If you want to pay over $100 you can find much better quality, but for 70% less this is a fantastic value."
1,These are terrible!,"I wish I had my $49 back! After washing they are just one big wrinkle. Even straight out of the dryer that are unusable. I tried all types of fabric softner/wrinkle reducer, etc. Maybe if I had all day to iron these I could use them. They do feel good to the touch but look terrible after washing."
1,Don't Buy,"All I can say is don't buy these sheets. While they are very soft, they wrinkle like crazy after being washed and need to be ironed. I'm returning mine for a refund!"
2,Item Description is Incorrect,"I bought these sheets because they advertised that they were 18 inch pockets. When they arrived, the packaging showed 16 inch pockets that fit and 18 inch mattress."
3,so-so,I would have thought at 500 tc they would have been softer! Wrinkles? You bet! I washed in cold water and dried on lowest dryer setting and still tons of wrinkles. I have 300tc sheets that are much softer and don't wrinkle nearly as much.
5,Bonanza review,"I found the quality superb. The color, sound, and overall quality was excellent. The case it came in was damaged, however. I was dissapointed. The bottom of the case was broken. It didn't look like a shipping issue so I have to conclude it got shipped from stock that way. If I could get a hold of the original seller I would like to give them a chance to correct the matter. Aside from that, the DVD's themselves were extraordinarry.I hope someone contacts me to resolve this issue in the near future.Dennis Sullivan"
5,Serving Life!,"I first saw this movie at a Hospice Center near us. I was very impressed because I am a Volunteer for Hospice & to watch a Documentary with Convicts doing Hospice Care totally Amazed Me! I honestly Prayed for them & I ended up watching this movie 4 times, so far. To care for people that are passing, is Very Difficult,but it also can be very rewarding!"
5,"Nice variety, great songs & music - hope to hear more","This CD has good down-home music with meaningful lyrics. It has country, a little romance, a touch of spanish, and down to earth. People can relate to the songs at the same time enjoy great music. I'm recommending it to my friends and hope to hear more of where this came from."
3,Don't Buy this,"I suppose if you were looking for special features, or something importnat you would buy this, but it says $170.00 as the price, so if you want to watch this movie, and own this movie buy the collection:Gunslinger Western CollectionIt has this movie, which I am in love with, plus 3 more movies. And, you won't have to pay $170.00 to watch If you Meet Sartana, Pray for Your Death"
4,Excellent mix of theory and applied work.,"This book is the perfect liasion between the microeconomics realm of information economics and the real world of banking and financial intermediation. It supplies a healthy dose of microeconomic theory to fully understand the underlying features of the most common financial instruments used in modern banking practice, all explained thoroughly with down to earth narratives and doable math/game theoretic instruments. It makes a wonderful preview before going on with Freixas text, or at least as its companion."
3,Rare piece of history...,"This incident is little-known among the general public -- perhaps because the would-be assassin was a mentally unstable black woman? Unfortunately, Pearson's writing style is choppy and meandering; the book needed more editing before publication. I also wish he had given more background on Izola Curry, the woman wielding the penknife. What became of her after her confinement to a state psychiatric facility? A historical writer should try to answer the questions readers are likely to ask as best as possible."
3,Sheds light on a little known part of history,I'd never heard the story of how MLK nearly lost his life in 1958. The attacker was a black woman with mental problems. The author does a fine job of telling the story and giving an overview as to what was going on in the country and New York at the time of the attack.
1,Ick... too much.,"Lead singer's voice is nice, the music is actually beautiful and good... but it's just WAY too much together. By the third song, I was thoroughly irritated. The overly-unnecessary girly background singers just crammed it into the wall and I couldn't bare it anymore. Very strong and classic styles combined harshly. With some thoughtful arranging, I think they could've smoothly blended them together.I love flamenco music--especially sung by strong women's voices, and I grew up with latin music, and it's all a nice idea, but they must've been so in love with this ""high concept,"" it just bashes you over the head without tempering it with a light little kiss. You know, like good jazz. They had to take it further than just a good concept.Sorry to say I was disappointed. I wanted to love it."
5,Great product!,"Love this item. Really good quality, looks great on my wall! I love the traditional patriots logo too."
2,useful,"Si vous doutiez que le travail du son, les voix de Lee Ranaldo et de Kim Gordon, les textes de Thuston Moore, sont des composantes essentielles de la musique de Sonic Youth, ce CD vous en convaincra définitivement.Si vous parvenez à l'écouter jusqu'au bout, je vous conseille également dans la mme collection ""Ze Pipo & guimbarde tribiote to Jean-Michel Jarre"" ainsi que ""Le meilleur de Pierre Henry par les Petits chanteurs à la croix de bois""."
4,"Interesting, but there are some Kindle issues!","While I enjoyed the book, I did find myself checking to see how many pages were left. I felt the writing was aimed more for a high school student than an adult. I haven't decided if I will read the second one and I was disappointed at how this one ended. I felt that the love story was ""pushed"" on the reader and it would have been more passionate if the two had actually taken longer to declare their love to one another. It seemed rushed. Also, if you are ordering this on a kindle beware, there are MANY issues w/ spelling. Sometimes the words had a zero instead of an O or the names were misspelled or pushed together to form one long word. It did not show up that way in the sample. All in all it was pretty good, there are certainly better historical fiction books out there."
4,politics and romance in 18th cent Poland,"A wonderfully readable true story, based on the diary of Countess Beresowska (a friend of the author's is a descendent of the countess and had the diary) which also gives a great look at history at the time. You see the influence of the american revolution, and how far back Russia's desire to invade its neighbors goes! Poland was the play thing of all her neighbors and the character's lives are turned upside down by the events of the time. The writing is not the best I've read, but as the story gets going it improves. The story is riveting and moving, and in the end the author does a good job of telling it."
5,Push not the River swept me away,"I love historical fiction and James Conroyd Martin provided me with a saga of Polish pride that was impossible to put down. I took this book everywhere with me so that if I was allowed a few minutes I could keep up with the life of Anna Maria and her conniving cousin Zofia as they interacted with the constant political changes of the area and threat of Russian rule. It gave me insight to the horrible conditions that existed for peasants and women of the time and their bravery and determination to survive protecting family and each other while their men fought for their country and land. Read Push Not The River first, and avoid making the mistake I did. You will come back to Amazon for Against A Crimson Sky. I'm glad I got both together in one order. I only took me a few days to finish both and now I can't wait for his third."
5,I just finished reading PUSH NOT THE RIVER,"The characters are still romping around in my head. I want a sequel to this book. I want it now. LOL When I picked up this book, I knew nothing about Polish history, but as I read the book and saw the spirit in the Polish population in the late 1700s, I recognized it as the same spirit we watched in the early 1980s when Lech Walesa stood up to the Communist government.Based on real people and the events that took place in Poland from 1792 thru 1794, PUSH NOT THE RIVER is a must read for anyone who enjoys historical fiction. It has it all, three dimensional characters, love, hate, greed, more twists and turns than a lonely mountain road, life, death, deception, and hope, above all, hope."
5,Best novel I've read all year!,"What a fantastic story! I'm a huge fan of historical novels and just happened to come across this one. What a great writer! I've never known much about Poland or Polish history, but I am really interested in finding out more after reading this story. The characters really come alive-and knowing that they really did exist makes it even more engrossing. I seriously could not put this book down-I just had to keep reading to find out what happened to Anna. Her story has really stayed with me, and I am dying to read the sequel. This is a definite must read for fans of historical novels, and really anyone who enjoys a good story well told. I've never taken the time to write a review before, but I really just want to get the word out on what a superior novel this is. Read it! You will love it!"
5,A new favorite book,"Excellent, excellent, excellent writing. I could not put the book down. Anna's decendant's must be proud to see her story retold by Mr. Martin."
3,"Not bad, but not great","I heard someone compare this novel to ""Gone With the Wind"", so I had to try it. However, the heroine, Anna, is dull as rocks compared to Scarlett O'Hara. She never became a real person to me. Zofia, her cousin, is more in the Scarlett bent as she flouts convention and takes lovers, but her character is never explored and she seems to be mostly someone who moves the plot along. There are ridiculous coincidences, questions that are supposed to be compelling- but the answers are obvious before the book reveals them, and I have to say not one real, interesting character in the entire book. Jan, Anna's love interest, is flat as cardboard.That said, it's a fun, light read. Just don't expect ""Gone With the Wind""!"
5,Reality History,"Forget reality TV, read Reality History! You'll be fascinated! Based on the actual diary of a Polish Countess in the late 1700's, this is an amazing portrayal of life in Poland during a difficult political period for the country and its people. But it's not a documentary- it's told through the eyes of the Countess Anna Maria with all the emotions and adventures that you will not believe anyone could endure and survive. You will not be able to put it down."
3,A Very Naive Woman,"It's true, this novel is hard to put down. Yet it has several problems. Much of the writing is awkward (and by an English teacher). But the most distracting element for me was Anna Maria's extreme naivete. She trusted her cousin long after she knew that Zofia was the catalyst that almost ruined her life (something she never confronts her over either)Furthermore, no one in their right mind would have gone off to Russia (in the dead of winter no less) to meet with her husband under the suspicious circumstances in which she did.Were these plot points devised by the author, or was this woman really so gullible?"
1,Couldn't Stay Awake,"This book was sure cure for my insomnia. Just a few pages and I was out like a light. Comparing this story to Gone with the Wind is like comparing a McDonald's hamburger to filet mignon. If you are interested in Polish history, check out Wikipedia - its more interesting and won't waste hours of your time and bore you with one-dimensional characters and predictable outcomes."
5,An excellent book,This book is a fantastic read. The fast action and interesting characters make it hard to put down before reading the last page. I would highly recommend this book to any historical fiction lover.
2,Could Put it Down,"If you're an insomniac, this is the book for you. I'm sure the story could have been handled better, but comparing this book to ""Gone With the Wind"" is sinful. The characters were flat, and the author just seemed to plunck down the bits and pieces of the real history, at will.If you like romance novels, this is the book for you. But calling it historical fiction is a bit of a stretch. I'm sorry I wasted several days finishing this, only to be disappointed even further when it was obvious that a sequel was in the offing. And, I won't be wasting my time on that either since the characters in this novel were boring and one dimensional."
4,Still not sure how I feel....,"At times I was caught up in the story. Other times, as I read yet again how powerless the Countess Gronska had become in her own home, I'd say to myself, ""Yes, we know that already....move it along."" As the main character's love, Jan, was absent for most of the story, (and a long story it was), I kind of lost interest in him, nor cared if they reunited in the end. The ending was anticlimatic for me. I did enjoy the story, but just can't rave about it. As for my rating, I flip-flop between 3 & 4. I probably went with 4 because of peer pressure!! (So many other fabulous reviews!)"
2,Get a Guide Book,"It's a high quality map, very attractive and waterproof. But it's not that useful on the ground. Get a good guide book with zone maps instead. We never referred to this even once in-country."
2,TERRIBLE,"this is one of the worst maps i have ever read. the streets are printed so small it is near impossible to read, and the street index is impossible to use due to the fact that some of the streets are listed by the article and others by the first word. give yourself a break and just pick up a free map at any of the numerous tourist information boards located around the city, most notably in grand place. the only reason to get this map is if you are going to be traveling in the brussels suburbs, where the free maps do not cover.oh, and one more thing. the easiest way to get around brussels is through their easy and free subway system. this map does not have any of the stops on it, as opposed to any of the free maps."
4,Map,"Very nice map, especially in rainy London. Wish it were a little bigger, or wish the title box was a little smaller."
4,Great overview of scenic hikes,"This book provides both a high level overview of 23 hikes from around the world, and some planning details such as transportation, dangers, seasons, etc. Highly recommended for people interested in hikes that are both scenic and challenging. The book is a little weighted toward north american hikes."
5,"Beautiful, and practical, too","I bought this book to get some information about a trip I'm planning with a friend. But the photos are nice enough that I'm leaving it on my coffee table. This is a great source of inspiration for many adventures, with enough practical information to help move beyond the fantasy stage to actually plan a trip."
3,Science kit,"I was a little disapointed with this kit. We have seen better. I have to say that it does have educational notes in with each experiment to help teach what is going on. I was expecting a wider variety of experiments and more props. Kids love most of all to mix things and there were no droppers or little scoops to allow them to do that. The ""chemicals"" were all in opaque silver lined bags so they were hard to pour and impossible to get a hand in to dig contents out meaning that mom had to pour it all into the one measuring spoon taking some of the fun out of it all. A different kit we had purchased came with test tubes, droppers, measuring cups, little scoops etc. and they had more fun when they were able to do more things themselves! It's not a bad product just looks more involved from the box than it really is."
4,Fun for Two,"This kit was purchased as a gift for our 6 year old son. It has been a way for two (our son and one of us) to get together for some wholesome, educational, and quality fun time. We would highly recommend this kit. It is great to have everything you need for some basic experiments in one box."
4,Obviously not the same movie.,"I've seen this film and enjoyed it a great deal. I've read the review below this one and I'm wondering if we've seen the same movie because I never saw any scene where the actor lays on the ground and entrails are pulled out from under the actors shirt. I've actualy watched this about 12 times and only remember seeing appliance type of effects that were done quite well. Some of the zombie make-up effects arn't quite as good as others, but the gore is all top notch.As for the Brunet in the movie, who's name is actualy Amy something or another, she is a cutie, but I don't know if I would say her acting was good enough to base a whole movie around her. I guess it depends on wether your wanting to watch an action/gore flick or a soft core flick. It's obvious some people don't get enough late night Cinemax."
2,"Umm, what?","C'mon people, let's be serious. There is no way this is a 4 or 5 star movie. I know the people who worked on this movie had little to no capital to make this movie, and the fact that they had some nice gore and so many people on the project is commendable.However, a coherent story and good dialogue costs nothing and that is what this movie lacks. Gory, shoestring budget B movies do not have to seem like they were written by a deranged person. Look at what George Romero did with ""Night of the Lving Dead"". Almost no budget, and he prodced a classic. It's films like this that give these low budget movies a bad name and made zombie movies a laughing stock. Invest in a screenwriting book next time, please.And when your main character is flying around in Halloween fairy wing costume in front of a green screen, it's time for a rewrite."
1,Zombie Cult Amateur,"Why are there zombies in this movie?--how did they come into existence?--and why does the devil have floppy boobs?The quality of this movie is worse than the usual low-budget fan-fare, virtually unwatchable on any standard. I loved Shatter-dead and the Meat Market films, but the production values on this heap are terrible.The movie cares more about the members of a cult who spend fifteen minutes of the movie singing along to a band while the preacher 'jams out' and the rest of the movie jabbering about how it sucks not to have sex. Meanwhile, zombies are wandering outside the perimeter of their camp. Why isn't the rest of the world being eaten? Why are the dead back to life? The viewer never finds out, and I disengaged.The computer effects on this are embarrassing and unnecessary. It looks like an arcade game from the 80's.I was very let-down after watching this. It looks promising, the reviewers on the VHS are good, but I'm telling you...this movie sucks!"
2,guitar,"I thought it would be more usable as a ""real"" guitar. Very hard to tune and strings were loose. Disappointed for what it costs."
2,Disappointed,I originally had a different guitar picked out for my 3 year and 5 year old grandsons. I switched to this one based on its description (even though it didn't have a recommended age group in the description). It was not packaged well at all. The box was dented but the guitar was unharmed. The steel strings on both guitars were rusted. I was going to ask for replacement strings but decided these were more than I was looking for for this age group. I will be sending them both back.
4,Great Guitar for a Toddler,From the other reviews it would appear that this is not ideal for an older child learning to play guitar as it slips out of tune.I was looking for a guitar for a three year old toddler who loves to pretend to play guitar and sing along.I had tried out other 1/2 size guitars but this seems more robust than the previous one I bought and the nylon strings are definitely easier on the fingers.I would have preferred that it came with a strap but I think that other than this it is a great guitar for a 3 or 4 year old to play with.
2,Not much better than a toy guitar you'd buy at Walmart,"This thing is a piece of junk. I know the price is right, and if you're buying it to shut your kid up for a few minutes I'm sure it'll do the trick. But if you expect anything remotely resembling decent sound to come from it, think again. The tuners are crap, the intonation is horrible.Mine arrived with a sharp dent in the back of the neck and several scuffs on the neck and body. On top of that, the frets were freaking rusted! I don't mean a spot of tarnish here and there, literally 50% of what was supposed to be silver was rust.I don't know what damp shed this thing came from, but judging by the rusted frets I'm guessing this thing would have warped after a few months in my dry house. I didn't give it the chance and immediately returned it. The only reason it got two stars is because I didn't expect it to be perfect for the price. But this was unacceptable."
4,Not bad at all,"Bought this for my son's 3rd birthday. He likes to play mine but I don't really care to let a 3 year old run around with a Fender Strat American Classic so we got him this to play and learn on. The strings are not metal so it doesn't hurt his fingers and that's a plus. The one thing I don't like about the guitar is that there are no attachments for a strap, I can remedy this myself, but shouldn't have to. Other than that great little student guitar."
2,Can't hold its tuning,"I got this guitar for my 5 year old, she loved it, and proceeded immediately to decorate it with Hello Kitty stickers. The guitar looks reasonably well made (for the price) and arrived without major finish flaws; however the tuners can't seem to hold the guitar in tune for more than a few minutes. This makes the guitar less than useful."
2,"Nice in cosmetics, bad in mechanics and sound quality","At first look, I loved it. But once get on tuning and playing, I realized this is not a playable instrument. I was going to give this to my 11 yr daughter, but no way. I could not make any chord sound right. Tuning after tuning, it doesn't stay tuned for more than 10 seconds. Even playing with one string from E,F,G,H,I going up by frets ... didn't make a right note sound. Low E sting makes just dead beat sound. Badly designed and manufactured instrument... I returned it."
1,Bridge broke away from body.,"I chose this 1/4 size guitar for my 5 year old Grandaughter for Christmas. While patiently tuning this guitar over several hours using a chromatic tuner for proper pitch the bridge broke away from the body. I've been playing,stringing and tuning guitars for over forty years. I was quite surprised and disapointed when the bridge suddenly broke away from the body. This was on Christmas eve. Perhaps a design flaw on this particular instrument, not enough glue, bad batch of glue? She had been asking Santa for a guitar of her own and wondered why Santa forgot it. I'm currently unemployed so otherwise I would have bought a more expensive model. She's still asking for it. I guess you get what you pay for."
3,Time will tell...,"It's smaller than I thought, but should be okay for the 6yr old I am gifting it to. As other reviewers have stated, it does not stay tuned for even an hour! I think this could be due to the nylon strings, and I tune it several times a day, hoping that by the time I gift it, the strings will have adjusted and will stay tuned. I have played accoustic guitar for many many years and new nylon strings can be a problem, although I have never encounted this much of a tuning nightmare... Also, the lower E string is has higher lift than the other strings but I can't see that the neck is warped. I have to say that every time I look at this guitar, I kind of giggle. It's the cutest d**n thing! Time will tell if it's more than just a toy, as the description indicates..."
4,A beginner guitar for a child,"It has a nice look, small size and okay sound. It will be just right for a young child to become acquainted with a guitar."
1,Absolute Junk!!!!!`,"Ive been plaing guitar for over 20 years and against my better judgment I bought this for my child based soley on the reviews. I was stationed overseas and couldnt get to a store to test one out. When I got home for Christmas, I went to tune it the entire bridge snapped off in front of my eagerly awaiting child..... needless to say we were both disappointed. Spend the extra money and get a better guitar."
3,Guitar For Kids,"i got this guitar for my nephews they lovin it, they were surprise it doesn't come with the guitar picks"
4,Not bad but hard to keep in tune,"I thought that this would be a good guitar for someone I know who has small hands. It isn't bad in general, but we have had one problem with it. It refuses to stay in tune long enough to play more than one song. And the tuning pins seems to slip a little. It must be tuned so frequently that this has become rather frustrating. Perhaps it just needs more time for the strings to settle in, but my other guitars are not this difficult to keep in tune. If you can deal with the tuning problem, I guess it would be a good beginner's guitar. For what I paid for it, I guess you can't complain. I suppose you could say that it's good for a beginner to have to do frequent tuning and that way he learns very quickly the notes of each open string! Just be aware that if you would be frustrated by frequent tuning, this one may not be for you."
3,Decent but doesn't hold a tuning.,"I bought this guitar for my son's 4th birthday. He likes it and it's well-sized for him but it doesn't hold a tune. I.e. it needs to be re-tuned every 5-10 minutes or so. I don't know if this is because it's a nylon-string or what, but it's definitely a pain."
5,Good starter guitar for child,I got this guitar for my 5-year-old granddaughter because she wanted to learn to play but my husband's guitar was too big for her hands. He's teaching her some chords and I think this is a great way for her to figure out if she wants to seriously take up the guitar someday.
3,"Build Quality is Nice, Strings... Not So Much","I like this guitar with two exceptions. Half of the strings are plastic. It makes it tough to tune and learn when the strings sound so different. MOST ANNOYING is the lack of fret markings on the face of the fret board. The packaging shows the almost ubiquitous white dots on the fret board, but these only exist on the narrow sides of the fret board. They're more visible to someone learning guitar, but it would have been nice to have them on the wide fretboard face. That's what they're showing in sales images."
1,Lauren LA 36 Guitar,I bought this guitar for Christmas 2012 for my grandson and it did not include at least one pick. how much does a pick cost 10 cents. I wish it said does not include picks.
2,Not the best FIFTEEN album,"I'll just say this....if you are new to ""Fifteen"" and want to check out one of their C.D's don't buy this one. The best one by far is ""Swains First Bike Ride"". Aside from a few random good songs the other albums aren't that great. I've known this band personally since inception and even during the Crimpshrine days and if you want their(jeff's)best music in my humble opinion then buy the ""Swain"" album."
5,Awesome!!,"We ordered this to make warning stickers in a Mechanical Room (Hot Surfaces, Rotating Parts, etc). The ink doesn't smear even if you put water on it and TRY to smear it. You can insert clip art images which is pretty cool (I inserted some industry standard warning images). It was quite a bit cheaper then what other major office chains are selling it. Also, it shipped from Amazon LLC, not Pex like two other reviewers had said, and it was the correct product-- Yellow Film with Black Ink. Whatever the problem was with shipping the wrong product in the past, Amazon/Brother has corrected it. Very pleased!"
3,Not what I wanted,It says clear but it has a white background. Misleading title. Clear is like transparent tape clear. I need to keep searching for the right product.
1,beware of depth and installation,"I took this back to the store after spending $21 on shipping that they would not refund, which I am not happy about ( I bought from sharper image directly). If your cabinets are standard depth (12"") this product will stick out about a 1/2"". What they don't tell you is that when you connect the tv antenna to the back it sticks out an inch. Also, they include a template to help you drill the holes in the right place BUT the hole on the template don't match the hole in the unit!Seems like all around poor planning."
4,Great little TV system for the price,"I'm not sure what people expect from a modestly priced kitchen TV system, but this particular model has served me well.The picture quality and sound quality are excellent. Considering the handling it gets, it is quite sturdy. The remote and the panel buttons are ingeniously designed so that even with wet hands one can adjust channels and volume. Setting the time, programming radio stations and the like are intuitive in design, easy to do without directions.I advise anyone to use care with measurements, as if you have a very tight space, you may struggle with installation. I had no problems myself, but you need enough room not only for the unit, but for the cables in the back. Once you've mounted this thing under the cabinet, it may be difficult to plug new things into the back, if it's mounted close against the wall. Think about exactly what you intend to plug into the back and do so before screwing this into the cabinet mounts."
1,An inescapably bad movie,"My other review was not posted, so I'll sum up. The actors were uninspired, though they occasionally seemed to be having fun, at least. The script had a few good moments that were mostly ruined by the direction and acting, and a lot of bad moments. The climax was boring and confusing. The whole thing lacked the beauty of the cartoons, the gentle charm of the TV show, the style of the previous movies, and the zest, wit, and good spirit of any of them.Like its own version of Lurch, this movie is a Frankenstein monster, part this, part that; it borrows from and alters things from the TV show and previous movies. But while Lurch, according to the script, ""has the *heart* of an Addams,"" the movie does not."
3,Not-Bad Direct to Video.,"When the Addams Family are invited to go on a little vacation to be in a Reunion from a letter but that letter was from another different Addams Family.Directed by Dave Payne made This is a Direct to Video with a different Cast, expect for two family members from the first two films are Back (Carel Struycken & Christopher Hart). Tim Curry as Gomez and Darly Hannah as Moticia are Quite Good in this one, Jerry Messing as Pugsley, Nicole Fugere as Wesnesday and Patrick Thomas as Uncle Fester are Replacing the Original first two films. It`s has some good humor but this is Weakest in the Series. Too bad, this film is shot on a Limited Budget, it`s shows. Grade:B-."
3,Seen the movie on TV back in 1998 and like it.,"I always thought that one day I would buy the movie, the only problem is that I have been waiting for Addams Family Reunion to be released on DVD and so far I have met with disappointment of it steel being unavailable in any other form than VHS. I do keep on holding on to the hope that Addams Family Reunion will someday be released to DVD, then and only then will I buy the movie. I promise you when I do see it in stores on DVD that I'll say ""At long last, it has come to DVD. I getting it before it will become unavailable to be gotten at all."" Giving that to be said, I would hope that someone would seriously consider release Addams Family Reunion to DVD."
1,Plain and simple ....STUPID!!!,1.It didn't start where Addams Family Values left off. 2.The ONLY original characters were Lurch and Thing.
5,very good,"product came earlier than expected so i was very pleased about that. The box was in good condition and nothing was wrong with the video itself,"
2,"Not Boring, Not a Waste of Time","This movie was not boring but not a waste of time. I can't rate it above 2 stars, that being the standard for mediocrity. It even picked up the ball dropped by the 80s version, but this is not the classic Addams family from TV. Tim Curry as Gomez gives it that made for TV horror feel, but Darryl Hanna as Morticica doesn't get that sultry but elegant, still sexy look for an older woman. For wanting Addams right here right now, it's not boring and is devoid of foul language. A mediocre movie from a Hollywood name that seen troubles since the classic 50s TV show. TV shows in other deacades played up the montrous elements of the characters, as on the 80s version; I guess this is the closest thing you'll get for Addams Family right here right now- that's not being disturbing."
1,Terrible...,"I thought I'd seen the worst movie EVER when I suffered through NASTY RABBIT. Ha! At least I made it all the way through that hideous disaster! ADDAMS FAMILY REUNION is a total embarassment! I could only stomach about 15-20 minutes of this wretchedness before shutting it down! Tim Curry as Gomez? Darryl Hannah as Morticia?? C'mon! These two have certainly seen better days, but hey, no one could possibly save this toilet-boat! Raoul Julia and John Astin must be spinning in their graves like cyclones over this! I only hope it never sees the light of DVD! Please, if you want to recreate the effect of this movie on the brain, do it the cheap way. Just punch yourself in the temples while slamming your face with a door! You have been warned... -- Update (2-6-10): John Astin lives! Sorry..."
2,Are you kidding?,"This movie was absolutly horrible. I saw so many horrible reveiws on this movie so it made me want to see it. I did stay alive through this. I did give it a chance, but it is a horrible movie. There! I said it. I happen to love The Addams family the movie and The Addams family vaules, but this? No way. My favorite character is Wednesday, but I have to say she was just plain stupid in this. So was Pugsley. Gomez and Martisha didn`t look anything like themselfs. Even Fester and Thing didn`t even act or look like themselfs. I don`t know about Mama, but I know COusin Itt was nothing like his character/ real self. Everyone says that Pugsley and Wednesday make no sense, but truely they sort of make sense. Ugh!!!!! Sheesh!"
2,IM BAACCK,"OK, I saw it. Made it thru pretty much. Yes I was right it did suck pretty bad. Supriseingly Hannah was pretty good. I think she tried to get to the original Morticia. While she is obviously no Angelica Huston she would have been good if I had not seen AH first. Tim Curry totally sucked. Whats her name who played Wednesday could not hope to shine Christina Ricchie's boots. Fester was lame too but who could possibly live up to Christopher Loyd ? So just don't bother, there are only 2 Addams family movies."
3,Another Addams Adventure,"It's not very, very, good.The mistake they made was, Morticia's parents are the only ones alive. Gomez's parents are Dead. It's not a very good plot.Tim Kully is a good Gomez, but he dosen't really Look like Gomez. Dayrl Hannah is an okay Morticia, and the Wendsday and Pugsly are bad.Pugsly, like in the first two is fat, but not tooooooooo overweight, like this one. Wednsday, does not look like Christina Ricci as Wedsnday.I think that they could have made a better movie."
5,How to organize a garden for inclement weather,"From hail and ice to summer droughts, gardens can face daunting seasonal survival challenges. Enter gardening expert Charles Smith's Weather-resilient Garden: a ""user friendly"" guide to planting a garden tough enough to withstand almost any kind of weather change. Blend an encyclopedia of 100 hardy plants with expert advice on how to organize a garden for inclement weather and you have a solid key to a lasting, beautiful garden."
3,sort of disappointed,"UPon reading this book, I talked to my Dr. about the exercises 'not recommended'. ie: forward bends and movements similar to those. I have exercised all of my life and maintaining flexibility in my spine is very important. The Dr. said to continue those exercises. Why would one want to NOT keep the spine flexible? It is a good book tho, the exercises are easy to do and it is clearly written and the pictures are helpful."
5,"As a Yoga Teacher, I highly recommed this book","Karena Lineback has done an excellent job with her book, Osteopilates. I am a former Rockette and Broadway dancer, and as I near my forties, I find this infomation extremely helpful. Many of my Yoga students are menopausal, the precautions listed definitely apply to them. Karena has included some excellent recipes, charts dealing with calcium percentages, as well as guides to practicing at home complete with photos. The book is loaded with valuable advice and written in an easy, conversational style. Her many years of training in dance and Pilates shine through."
2,working w/ the book Osteopliates by K. T. Lineback,The charts were difficult to figure out. I could not place my own Tscores on the chart with any sense at all. I showed the book to pilates instructors as well as doctors without making sense of the chart. I have been doing pilaes for 3 years and the modified versions of the exercizes did not make me feel that I was getting a good workout.
3,ur!,"ur kidding right? the production is below average, and although far from mainstream, and I love a good underground vibe and production (90% of what i now listen to is underground), the lyrics are very simplistic and songs get so focused on their message, they forget to flex skills... very simple and old school...their next 2 albums are MADNESS, but i regret adding this to my collection!peace,"
4,The L-E-X-I to the C-O-N,"Yo, i'be been feelin these guys for a long time. I had their first ep, and their record, and then I thought they disapeered and they hit me wit this!! The beats are dope, and the lyrics are dope, but the songs put together as a whole are incredible. My favorite is Change the Times and Complicated is on point too and so is 6 shooter. Yo, they are all on point. This and Loot Pack are the best albums comin out the west right now. Buy this album!!"
1,Factory Reject?,"The very first time my Boxer pup played with this toy he couldn't get the rings off! That's fine....but when he finally did, the rings and bone had come apart at the seams. Luckily I was watching him play so I caught it right away and he didn't eat the stuffing. I don't know if this was a defective product or what but it certainly was a disappointment.I have hand sewn the seams together and he is playing with it but one shouldn't have to do that with a brand new toy. We own the Hide a Squirrel, by Kyjen, and have had NO issues at all."
1,Flimsy.,"I bought this toy for a 3 month old puppy. He chews but is not a heavy chewer.Within the first 24 hours one of the rings was coming apart at the seams.In the next 24 hours the blue bone was ripped at the seam, the squeaker was out of the stuffing and another ring was torn.I can't imagine a dog that could play with this gently enough not to destroy it within days.No good."
3,So So Toy...Not as unique as I had hoped,"This was just an average toy for my 16 mos. lab. She loves soft-type toys. She doesn't really see the toy as a puzzle but rather as a 'fetch' toy so it doesn't really stimulate her intelligence. She likes playing with the detached rings and squeekies; but doesn't seem interested in pulling the rings off the bone. Fortunately, she is pretty easy on 'stuffed toys' in general as these are not that durable for chewers and/or tearers. One of the seams of one of the rings split fairly easily within the 1st few days. My pet peeve with this toy is its SMELL. The material and/or stuffing have a mildew type smell. I've tried airing it, sunning it, Febreezing it, disinfecting it, etc.; but with No success. It was made in China and somehow acquired this noxious (to me at least) smell. My Lab doesn't seem to care however. While it's an OK toy, I think others are better value."
1,Comes apart at the seams,"I got this toy for my 7 month old corgi. I read the instructions, which said to start off by removing the rings and letting your dog play with them first. I was glad I did, because I could see right away that the main seam on the blue bone was coming unstitched --- even before my dog played with it! Then I took a good look at the rings and half of them were coming apart at the seams too. Another disappointing dog toy. Note to dog toy makers: I will gladly pay more for toys that work! How can you stay in business when your products are so poorly made? I have a puppy, not some power-chewer, and I'm getting to the point where I don't know what kind of toys to buy for him. I don't want him to ingest stuffing made from Lord knows what in China. Please - give us something that is durable, fun for the the dog, and most of all, SAFE. Made in America would be nice too."
1,Very poorly constructed!!!,"as soon as she grabbed the toy she pierced the 1st ring!!! The insides came out, she was trying to swallow & almost choked! Went right into the trash!! UNSAFE!"
4,Great fun for our lab,Our lab has many toys. We pick them up and place them in a crate in the corner.We'll put the rings back on the bone and he'll get it out and play with it. Working the rings off the bone isn't much of a challenge for him anymore but he still likes this toy.The quality isn't the most sturdy and we're seeing some wear at the seams on the bone part that the rings go onto.Thankfully our lab lives up to his breed and he's a soft chewer. This toy wouldn't last long with our friend's boxer / rot mix. She's a power chewer.
4,"Not really a ""puzzle"" toy...","This isn't really a ""puzzle"" toy. If you're looking for something that will take your dog 10+ minutes to solve, then this isn't really right for you. It only took a few minutes to pull all the donuts off the bone for my jack russell. I don't think there is much mental stimulus involved with this toy. But other than that, it's a great squeaky toy that can be played with for a while. He will pull off all the donuts and squeak away. I've only had it for a week, but so far it seems like a very durable toy even for a chewer."
3,IntelliBone Dog Toy,"My Lab enjoys the IntelliBone. She carries it around the house, with and without the rings. She just got this for Christmas, and after a few days has gotten the hang of taking some of the rings off, though she seems to prefer playing with the rings as ""toss and fetch"" toys.**Update: Although my dog truly enjoyed playing with this toy, the seams ripped easily. I had to sew them together a number of times. Little by little, the pieces have ended up in the trash. I don't know if I would recommend the ""IntelliBone"". The dog liked it, but it didn't hold up very well."
2,squeakers,"my dogs' only intent is to find the squeaker inside. needless to say this toy didnt last very long because of that. they never actually took the time to remove the rings from the bone. i removed one or two for them to see they came off but once removed, they only seemed interested in finding the squeaker inside. so the plush bone and the rings were destroyed within a week. the dogs loved the toy!! but they love the squeakers more. the small was the perfect size for both my yorkie-poo and min pin. the rottweiler liked playing with it too. i would probably buy another one because they liked it so much."
2,halloweeny queeny,"Normally my family LOVES the Goosebumps movies, but this one didn't keep us interested at all! I was really quite surprised, considering we do enjoy all of them. Ghost Beach gets a thumbs down. Sorry Mr. Stine ~"
3,color,don't like the dark gr color of this fiesta plate. prefer the lighter green. like the product just not this color.
4,Good solid plates,These are good solid plates with very few complaints. They have seen some use and have a few dings out of them. Someone needs to make some heavy duty plastic plates that are microwavable. Since they don't then I am happy with these.
2,Show funny. DVDs poorly put-together,"I'd like to see the show from beginning to end instead of clipped together, but this isn't a complete deal-killer, given this is a variety show format. But what annoys me about this is that each volume only contains about an hour's worth of material (presumably so Time-Life can send you one volume at a time and charge you an arm and a leg without you realizing it). The other problem with the disc, decidedly more dumb, is the inability to pause the disc in order to take a short break. That was not an oversight, that was a deliberate disabling of a disc feature and for what reason, I have no idea. But in order to make the disc stop, you have to press ""stop."" When you restart, you start over from the beginning. I would NEVER pay money for this. I'm glad I was able to get it through my library, but I won't be bothering to get subsequent volumes."
5,love Dean Martin!,"I know a lot of people would poo-poo the idea of buying VHS, but when you see how much these sets normally go for, you'd buy them, too. I have a combo player, so whatever style I buy is fine, doesn't really matter. The quality of this video is excellent. It looks like it was just filmed last week. If you are a ""green-minded"" person, you should be buying these products anyway, to keep them out of a landfill."
1,DevaCurl Products,"Well, not what it was hoped to be. I've used it all, all that comes in the bag, followed every step just as they said, but it was no better than every other ""curl"" product I've tried. Of course my hair is not what someone else's is so it may be just what you're looking for. I have corse, thick, curly, wavy, frizzy hair. The straight iron is my best friend. I would love to not be so tied down. Be able to go swimming and scrunch something in the hair and sit on the beach or by the pool and look normal. This won't do it for me either. It made my hair feel dirty, like straw and stiff as a board. Sorry, I wish I had better news."
2,The Long Season,I too was hoping for more about Bruno's racing experiences than reading about racing in Europe. There are other books for that. What he did write about his own experiences I enjoyed. I only wish there was more of it.
3,"Not bad, but...","Bruno chronicles his amateur cycle racing season and a parallel pro season, as seen through TV coverage. He captures the monomania that seems to be a part of racing, and the descriptions of his races are quite good--the long frustrations, punctuated by occasional flashes of glory when you can do no wrong or simply get lucky. The descriptions of the pro season are less successful. I was left wishing for more of his racing and training, and less of his second-hand view of the pro peleton.This book could have been something like _Caught Inside_, Daniel Duane's similar account of surfing for a year on the California coast. I don't think the author has quite found his own voice yet--the writing is too self-conciously Hemingwayesque, and he flinches from the idea that readers may actually be more interested in a struggling cat 3 than in the heroes in Europe."
2,where is his racing experiences?,if i wanted a second by second account of the tour de france and other races i would have watched the videos. i read my velo news and this is what i expect but not from a book that supposedly is about a personal experience of amateur racing..maybe 2 percent of this book was his actual racing..and that is not what i expected..
5,Teens will love this book!,"I am a Sunday School teacher for High School aged kids. I bought this book hoping to use it at the beginning of my classes as a 5 minute devotion. Right away it turned into the entire lesson each week. The devotions are wonderful, and really sparked some great conversations from the youth. I highly recommend this book!"
4,The beast of Dio,"This disk contains most of Dio's best songs. Most songs on this disk are good, but not all of them. My favourites are Rainbow In The Dark, Dream Evil, and Holy Diver. If you're a Dio fan, you must own this disk, unless you have all the previous Dio albums."
4,Dio's best compilation album,"I don't think I have experienced this album very much so I don't really have much to say about this album But I think any body who's new to ronnie james dio's solo project should pick this album up and give it a spin, It has pretty much all of dio's best songs such as stand up and shout any many more from his older classical metal albums.I got my copy of this album from my local walmart and walmart seems to have a very poor selection of good music these days but I get a discount since I work there.\m/ stay metal \m/RIP ronnie james dio (July 10, 1942 - May 16, 2010) you will be missed!"
3,Gran recopilatorio pero falto de joyas,"Indudablemente Ronnie es una de las voces maestras del Metal, bien demostrado en Black Sabbath y Rainbow, pero su trayectoria en solitario, estuvo marcada por el ""Holy Diver"" del 83, su mejor disco sin duda, ahí estan clásicos como ""Rainbow in the dark"", y la propio ""Holy Diver"", después, solo quedan, ""Last in line"", ""Sacred Heart"" y ""Don't talk to strangers"", se echa de menos la gran balada ""Egypt""."
1,"Like Tenacious D says, ""NO MORE ROCKING FOR YOU!""","Ugh! How did this man become a heavy metal messiah? This is nothing more than disguised hair metal with Satan somehow stuck in between. He wants to be tough, so he makes really crappy lyrics and really crappy chord progression and 80's laser keyboards. Why dosen't he scream in the middle of a song, ""DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDIIIIIIIIIIIIIOOOOOOOOOOO!"" fr 45 minutes? That would make him even more cheesier."
4,"It's time to ""Stand Up And Shout""!","All I can say, is that if you have no Dio in your metal collection, then you have an incomplete metal collection. When it comes to hard rock, he is the ""King Of Rock and Roll"". Diehards might miss a song or three, but this is perfect for the casual fan. In order of release, 4 tracks from ""Holy Diver"", including ""Rainbow In The Dark"" and the classic title song. 3 from ""Last In Line"", including that track, and the rocking ""We Rock"". 4 from the ""Sacred Heart"" album, which has that excellent title track, as well as ""Rock 'N' Roll Children"". Toss on a live ""Man On The Silver Mountain"", and the better songs from his later albums, and this collection lives up to it's title. Be you a fan of Black Sabbath, Tenacious D, or metal in general, it's time to accept Dio into your life."
4,Near Perfect,Only missing 1 awesome song from R.J.D's band Dio Gypsy which can be found on the Holy Diver album and I would have also liked to have heard the album version of Man on the Silver Mountain by Rainbow anotof Dio's bands that rocks ass
4,Classic Power Metal from the 80's,"This compilation from Rhino is probably all you need to own from Dio to have a complete overview of Ronnie James Dio career. This CD is focused on the most succesful 80's albums (Holy Diver, Sacred Heart and Last in Line). After these, Dio slowly faded away in the 90's but continued to released records.Dio was not the most representative band of the 80's power metal scene but this compilation shows that it was an inspired band with a very powerful singer."
3,A little disappointed.,"Perhaps I expected a little too much from this book. As an Englishman born at the very end of the war I still seek answers to the devastation I saw as a child and didn't receive then. I was hoping that with the journalistic skills of the author that this was going to be the definitive work on the bombing of our capital city, London. I found the anecdotal nature of this work distracting from it's stated primary intention. As with all criticism however, it is just the critics opinion and in this case this critics disappointment, but there is a lot to be gained by reading this work for anyone who had no knowledge of the blitz and who would be more accepting of it's format."
1,To the cut-out bin,"I read a lot of books and this one did not all at all catch my interest. In the 1970's when an album did not sell it was consigned to the cut-out bin, to be sold for $1.99, etc. Such should be the book-equivalent fate for this book. My time reading it was not well-spent, and I regret that I did not use that time reading something worthwhile. Especially do not buy it if you are a WWII buff and have an interest in the December 29, 1940 air raid- you will be very disappointed."
2,Great for the 12 min. it lasted!,"My pet really likes this, but this is by no means durable. My dog had it for about 12 min. before a squirrel lost a leg and the stuffing was everywhere. After removing that one, the ""stump"" part also got a big tear in it within a 1/2 hour. Maybe the X-Large version would have been better for my 60 lb dog, but I won't be spending the money to find out."
3,My dog loved it.,"My dog loved the squirrels and they are in his constant rotation of toys. Unfortunately he's already destroyed two of the three squirrels, so the durability of the toy is not great ( it's been about a month since we got them)."
5,Hide a squirrel pet toy.,My dog loves this toy! Of course she loves chasing squirrels too. She has played with it so much that the squeakers are no longer working.
1,waste of money,"After being impressed with the advertisement and speaking with some highly motivated Kyjen representatives, I bought a few Kyjen toys. Unfortunately, my dogs either destroyed some in a few minutes or simply were not at all interested in the others."
3,"Love the toy, wish the quality were better","I love the concept of this toy and so does my dog, who took to it right away! However, within a couple minutes of her playing with the toy, she was instantly able to rip off the ears to one of the squirrels/chipmunks. Within a couple of days, she had opened up the seams to all three squirrels and could access the stuffing and potentially the squeakers. Although she's a puppy (5 mo) and teething, she's not an aggressive chewer and hasn't been able to rip apart other toys, which indicates to me this product could have been better made. Would certainly love to purchase more squirrels in the future if they are better made!"
3,"Dog loves it, but it's already falling apart!","Within an hour of opening the box my dog had torn the stitches out of the back of one of the squirrels. I took them all and reinforced the seams, but now he's got a hole in the fur of another squirrel and the squeaker is dead in one as well. THIS IS DAY ONE! He LOVES the toy, but it sure falls apart quickly. I think I'm going to throw out the squirrels but keep the tree trunk and just hide other stuff in it."
5,My 11 pound Yorkie Poo's favorite toy - size large,I am ordering two more of these. My YorkiePoo went through her first one in about three years. She chewed out the plastic in the bottom in about 12 months when she was a puppy but stilled played with the stump for 2 more years - There is a second bottom so even after she destroyed the plastic and the outside bottom we could still hide the squirrels in it. She is on her second one now. 80% of the time when she brings a toy to play fetch with it is the stump. She plays with the squirrels some but mainly the stump.
4,Great fun...except for one thing.,"My dog (a chihuahua) really enjoyed playing with this toy when I first brought it home. It was especially satisfying to her if I place a couple of treats inside. The quality is good (so far), the size is perfect for her, and the squeakers really encourage play.However, there's one flaw. The holes are smaller than you'd expect and lined with very inflexible trim. I have a small chihuahua, and she's gotten her head stuck inside on more than one occasion. The toy should have used an elastic trim instead...which would have offered resistance but not enough to potentially frighten the animal and prevent them from sticking their snouts in a second time. She's a little wary of it now and while she still grabs at the squirrel, she doesn't go looking inside for treats.Also, the size is a bit deceptive. I purchased a ""large,"" and while the height and width of it are perfect for my dogs, my dogs are all under 5 pounds."
4,"Loved the ""chipmunks"" to death in three days.","This ""squirrel"" (truly, chipmunk) toy is well made as plush goes. But it can only get about a grade of ""C"" for durability. And my Golden is really not an aggressive chewer. I give it an ""A"" for fun. The trunk still looks fine, but she has loved two ""chipmunks"" to death in three days. Part of this is because she enjoys this toy A LOT, and the interactive nature of it gets her rather worked up. I bought the Large size, and that turned out to very much be the right size for my Golden retriever."
5,so cool,"my dog loves this thing. for a four month old vizsla this is the cadillac of plush dog toys. unless your dog is an idiot, theyll have no problem figuring it out."
3,pet toy,"My pug loves toys, but didn't really care for this. It seems like a cute item, but my dog just didn't seem to like it. Maybe yours will."
5,Cleverest Yet,"It didn't take my 4-month-puppy long to learn how to remove the squirrels from the stump. She loved watching them be put back in the holes, and, on that first encounter, would happily have kept me at it all day long."
5,My dog went nuts for this,My Jack Russel went crazy for this - he loved it. I say loved in the past tense because he hid all the squirrels somewhere in the house and now he just worries the tree. But he still seems to like the empty tree and the squirrels whenever I find one.
3,makes them think,"But they don't play with it very often. When they do, they seem to enjoy it. Not sure they realize the squirrels squeak."
4,good toy,"My husky pup likes this toy but he only likes to bite the little squirrels and make them squeak. To him it's not so much of a puzzle. As he grows bigger the squirrels are smaller to him and sometimes I am afraid he's going to swallow them. But he still likes to pick them up and squeak them. I'd say if you have a medium or small breed dog it will be a great toy. They held up, to my surprise, since my pup tears up stuffed toys very quickly."
3,We had our first Squirrel Casualty After a Week.,"I know everyone is talking about how they got this for their big dogs but I bought this for my FOUR pound Maltese. My puppy loves toys bigger than her and loves to play. She plays REALLY REALLY HARD and she's BY FAR the smartest dog I have ever seen so I figured she'd love this toy. Of course she did. The problem was the quality of the Squirrels. She got this toy on Christmas Day and she had the ear off and the back seams torn out of one of the Squirrels...but she loves that one eared Squirrel and takes it with her everywhere. Good thing they make refills for the Squirrels. She doesn't really like the Tree Trunk but I think it's because she hasn't played around with it much yet. (She got a ton of toys for Christmas and is still exploring them all).I would recommend this product. However, I would just suggest you buy extra Squirrels right away."
3,"Dog wasn't interested, but cute","My foster dog wasn't interested in playing with it at all, but my children loved it. I'm going to be sending this to a friend to use for her dogs as I'm not longer fostering dogs, hopefully they'll get some use out of it. The price was right when I bought it though, so I'm not too upset about it. I gave it 3 stars because my foster wasn't interested, but it seems really well made and a cute idea on how to keep your dog mentally stimulated without tearing up your yard."
4,"squirrels good, squirrel house not so good","I got this toy for my 3 1/2 month old whippet. He absolutely loved it - especially the house. Unfortunately, the squirrel house only lasted 2 weeks because he tore at the light fabric on the inside and started chewing on the plastic disc on the bottom. That was the end of the house, which was his favourite part. He still enjoys the squirrels (VERY LOUD) and loves it when I take them for play sessions in the park."
5,My dog loves this toy!,She is a bigger dog who loves to rip apart stuffed toys. I figured this was worth a shot because pulling the little squirrel's out might prevent her from destroying the toy so quickly. It has worked quite well. Though she has still chewed up the tree part a little bit - the amount of time this thing survived compared to other plush toys is ten fold.
5,Fun,"This is a quality toy for our Corgis. They love to ""find"" and remove the squeaking squirrels. It took many months to destroy all of the squirrels, but I was more than happy to order replacements."
4,Love it but the squirrels don't always stand up to chewing,"I first purchased the large version and then the ginormous. The large one was great, but if the squirrels weren't in the log, my dog would chew on the log. Eventually the log got chewed up pretty bad, and I was hoping to keep my dog busy for longer. That's when I bought the ginormous one, which has more squirrels. The original 3 squirrels from the large version where holding up well even with lots of chewing, but the new squirrels that came with the ginormous one have been tearing at the seams. I keep trying to sew them up, but my dog just keeps going through them. That being said, I love the toy and will just have to buy replacement squirrels at some point. My puppy loves the squirrels and that's what matters."
1,Gone in a half hour!,"I ordered 2 of these and they came today. One was for my Border Collie, and one was for my English Bulldog.Now, don't get me wrong, the dogs loved them, especially my Border Collie. He figured out how to get the squirrels out immediately, and proceeded to rip all 6 of them apart, right down to the squeaker. Both tree trunks are still good, but no more squirrels! And I realize that I can order more squirrels, but I can see where this cold turn out to be pricey.I'll give kudos for a toy that dogs love, but the squirrels are not durable and rip apart in minutes. I've got torn up squirrels and stuffing all over the yard, and my dogs are now whining for more squirrels."
4,My dogs love this!,-Wow! What a hit! I have a medium size dog and a Cha-wienie. The little dog goes nuts with this toy. Pretty soon the bigger one gets involved and its a party going on! SQUIRREL!!!
3,Did not hold up,I have a pitbull mix and she had the squirrels shredded in less than 20 minutes. The only reason I have given this three stars is we still use the log to hide her other toys.
5,Great Quality My Lab Loves this,Great Quality My Lab Loves this. Another great product from Kyjen. Will continue to purchase all my dog's toys from them.
5,And that's not all,"My grandpuppy loves this toy and has even discoverd new ways to play with it. Perhaps not what the manufacturer intended, but we have renamed it ""Hump-A-Stump""."
2,Endless hours of fun? Try minutes to destroy.,"I was so excited to get this product for my German Shepherd as it was recommended on another site for my dog. When I got it she immediately sorted it out. After about three times in a row of pulling out all the ""squirrels"" - she immediately got bored and tore apart one of the squirrels tails. I took it away after she ripped it up, but then she started in on another one. The tree part seems to be very strong, but the squirrels - - - not so much. I'm going to look for something small and tough to take their place.Recommendation - use for a small dog or one that isn't a chewer and/or isn't rough on their toys."
2,Cute idea... In theory,"Mr. Buddy ate this in about 20 min. All the squirrels disappeared very quickly, into the trash.It's a cute idea but it is easily torn apart."
3,Happy with similar product but the sizing was confusing,I love this toy! The only thing was is that the Junior size was too small for my mini aussie. We actually needed to get the large size for him which originally i thought might have been to big but the large was perfect. he loves this toy and i recommend it to anyone with a dog who needs a distraction.
3,Smaller than we thought...,"Overall, this toy is smaller than we thought it would be. I have a golden retriever (approx. 95 lbs) and I was scared he would eat one of the squirrels! Once he learned that they were a toy and not a snack, he really enjoyed it. I do like that the toy stores itself well. I can easily shove the squirrels back into the log and they don't end up all over the house. My dog likes to play with them, but he may be too big for this toy. Overall, I would recommend it for medium/smaller dogs."
5,Great Toy,"My yorkie-poo puppy loves this toy. Although she figured out right away how to get the squirrels out, I hide other toys and treats in the ""tree trunk"" and she enjoys the challenge. She also loves the little squirrels and carries them around with her. I recommend this toy and am happy with my purchase."
5,Great dog toy!,"I recently purchased this for my 9-month-old pitbull/lab mix. He's a pretty heavy-duty chewer (he often demolishes frisbees and rope bones in under 20 minutes), so I wasn't sure how long this toy would stand up to him. We've had it for almost a week now and it's still in perfect condition, despite the fact that he plays with it multiple times a day. From the moment I took it out of the package, he loved to carry the little squirrels around while squeaking them. I put a couple of treats inside along with the squirrels the first couple of times and he figured out pretty quickly how to pull them out. Now he brings me the tree every couple of hours to have me put the squirrels back in. Overall, the ""puzzle"" part is a little too easy for him (it takes him about 30 seconds to pull out all three squirrels), but that doesn't seem to reduce his appeal. I will certainly be buying more toys like this."
2,"Cute, but destroyed quickly","My Border Collie really loved this toy, however, he had the squirrels out in seconds. After getting the squirrels out he proceeded to tear up every one of them quickly. Finally, he ripped the tree to shreds. So, if your dog is rough on toys this is not for you. It's too bad because it is a cute idea and a cute toy. If they made a sturdier version I would buy again."
5,Awesome!,I have a 1.5 year old beagle and he LOVES this toy! He loves pulling out the squirrels and on top of that the squirrels are fun for him to play with! They are perfect! They squeak and have a fuzzy tail which he loves! Great idea and GREAT product!! So glad I bought this. WOrth the money:)
4,NOT for agressive chewers. Do your research first.,"A wonderful toy, unfortunately my dog destroyed it within a day or so, the tree first and then squirrels later. I should have known by now not to buy stuffed toys for my Lab, but it was his 1 year birthday gift :("
2,Very cute but not durable,"I boughts five of these for Christmas presents for my dog and my granddogs. The dogs loved them, but it wasn't long before the squeakers were pulled out and the stuffing was all over the floor."
1,Didn't last long,"Toy was interesting at first, but now, about two weeks after receiving it, my terrier mix has done something with the squirrels/chipmunks and we cannot find them. Sometimes she will play with the house, but what good is that without the critters that go in it? Definitely requires parental supervision! Maybe these should be tethered together somehow...too expensive to have missing pieces."
2,Not dog-proof....,"We have bought stuffed dog toys that employ some form of ""chew-guard"" backing to help the toy withstand the chewing that's to be expected with a dog. I wouldn't expect toys like this to last forever, but I do expect them to survive at least a few days (to hopefully a few weeks). Unfortunately, This toy doesn't seem to be designed with dogs in mind. He had already torn open the first squirrel within 5 minutes of play. So although this is a great LOOKING toy, it doesn't appear to be durable."
4,Puppy loves it but...,My 6 lb mini doxie loves this toy and plays with it a lot. Just be careful to supervise your pets. Maggie got her head caught in one of the holes while trying to retrieve a squirrel. She could not free herself and it was difficult to get her head out. We bought the large size and the holes aren't that big. Our puppy is just very good at getting herself caught in difficult situations. It is a very cute and fun toy but we will make it a supervised toy only from now on. 4 stars because of this problem.
5,My dog loves this!,"My frenchie looooooves this toy. in fact, i've bought my second one because after about a year she destroyed the ""tree trunk"" and also chewed off the eyes and tails of the squirrels.... so I bought her another one!I've also bought the bees in a hive toy from the same company. She loves that one too, but I think she likes the squirrel one better."
5,Awesome Toy,"This is the second time I have purchased this toy. The last one I had was ripped into pieces by one of my dogs, but he absolutely loved it. I bought this again for my puppy knowing that he would love it too. I know the item is not well made for dogs, but seeing how happy it makes my puppy I'll keep buying it for him. I wish they sold all three of these toys (bumble bee hive) in one package."
5,Entertained dogs are good dogs.,This toy offers a challenge for your dog getting the squirrels out of their tree stump and then the reward is to have them squeak for the dog. Plus your dog then can interact with you by playing fetch with the squirrels. Endless fun and keeps your dog out of mischief! Plus it looks cute around the house. Good conversation piece for guests.
3,"Good, but not great","I got this for my westie mix. HE LOVES IT (a little too much). He likes chewing on the toys and pulls the stuffing out. He started this behavior about 3 weeeks after I got it. Overall it's a good product, but I wish the squirrels were more durable.ps. Putting food inside really keeps him interested."
2,poorly made,I bought this for my 12 pound pomapoo the squirrels were torn in five minutes. The tree lasted ten minutes. Not well made. If you have chewer stick to plastic.
5,Amuses the Dog and His Human Too,"I bought this toy 10+ years ago for my Labs and they loved it! They didn't need to be taught to remove the squirrels from the tree stump--that came quite naturally. I still have a couple of squirrels from the original set. This Christmas, my mom gave a new set to my dogs. My Border Collie mix just loves it! He's a little rough on toys (destroys a tennis ball in 2 minutes) so I only let him play with this one while supervised. The tiny squirrels are a favorite to carry around squeaking in his mouth. I think it's more amusing for me to watch him get the squirrels out of the stump than for the dog. I recommend this toy and have even gifted it to dog friends."
2,Kept pup occupied for two days,In two days my puppy got to the squeaker / stuffing in 2 of the three toy squirrels (trashed). The tree is not to far behind. Definitely not a toy for puppies.
5,Smaller than expected,"I got this toy for my teething puppy to chew on. The little chipmunks are small, but they're perfectly sized for him to carry around. They are basically squeakers with a little stuffing in the head, so I don't have to worry about my puppy swallowing stuffing. He's torn apart all his other toys but these are holding up well."
2,Was fun while it lasted...,"My dog loved it! But it was destroyed in less than 24 hours. My dog does destroy most toys though. Wish it would of lasted, he had fun with it."
1,Many squirrels ordered over the years- one bad batch,We have ordered the squirrels many time with no issues - this order had one box that immediately the seams ripped on each squirrel. The faulty set was given to the oldest dog who loved her first batch of squirrels and was recently diagnosed with cancer thru out her system. I knew she would love some new squirrels. I had to stitch up each squirrel around the entire tail area and other portions of the body; obvious issue with stitching. The other box went to a 9 month old puppy who plays continuously with the squirrels and not one of them had to be repaired. First bad experience with my order of squirrels.
4,My two puppies love this product,"I bought this for my two siberian husky puppies. They love this toy, especially the ""tree stump"". They often both bite onto opposite sides and play tug-a-war with it. The only complaint I have about this product is that the green leaves that are sewn onto the stump have now been removed by my puppies constant tearing at them."
4,Dog Loves - Little Tear After 3rd Day of Play,"My dog loves this toy. She has such a good time trying to get the little squirrels out of the tree truck. She figured it out pretty quickly, but does not get bored doing it over and over.I have a 40 pound boxer/pitt bull mix. We ordered the Jumbo size, which is a good size for her. The toy appears and feels durable, but after the 3rd day of play there is a little tear in a seem and some stuffing has come out. I am going to sew it shut, so I am not too upset about this, but this is why I gave the toy 4 instead of 5 stars.Overall, me and my dog are pleased with this purchase!"
2,"He loved it, it lasted 2 hours.","My Boston Terrier puppy (5 mos.) loved this toy. He loves the squirrels still, but he can no longer love the tree stump. After 2 hours of playing with the squirrels and getting them out of the tree stump, it started to rip and the stuffing was coming out so I had to discard the stump. I am not sure if this is shotty material, because he is a bit rough on some of his toys. If you buy this, make sure that your dog isn't rough on toys."
5,A+ for this dog toy!,"I wish I was as easily amused as a golden-doodle, cause she loves this thing.. each squirl squeeks and apparently it's quite fun to pull them out of the fuzzy tree stump (you can also load it up with other squeaky fun toys, there's room)!"
2,Not Durable,"My puppy LOVED this toy, but it is marketed as durable, and within 24 hours she had ripped open the bottom of the toy and eaten the cardboard that was sewn in the bottom. She threw it up, and although she is still playing with the toy I feel reluctant to recommend!"
3,Not very robust,"Based on other people's reviews, I bought this for my two year old Havapoo (half Havanese; half Poodle). She was intrigued by it but essentially used it as a chew toy. She got tired of it in a few minutes. However, she prefers things she can chew on (like Nylabones), so this toy may work for dogs that are not hard chewers."
2,Rips way too easily,"Our 7 mo. Golden Retriever puppy instantly loved this toy, jamming her nose into the plush tree holes to get at the squeaky critters and carry them around a bit. Though we adored seeing her happy and supervised her closely, I think this toy has one considerable flaw- it seems poorly constructed. The concept is great, but the object just didn't hold up for the recommended play. Just by playing at our feet for a few minutes at a time, she popped a hole in the bottom, ripped the thread holding the felt leaves and seams holding the tree trunk together, and yanked out loose stuffing. She also easily ripped off the weakly adhered fur on the animal tails. We use and love interactive toys, but even for a supervised toy, it didn't stay intact for even a few days. She's had the iQube too, which was a bit sturdier. I wish this company would make a better product for the good concepts they have."
3,Easily disemboweled,"The dog (1 yr. old Husky) loved it and really liked the hiding squirrels. She gently carried them all over the house and played hide and seek with them very well. Unfortunately she liked them too much and they all lost their innerds and squeekers in a matter of days. I will try replacement squirrels but if they deflate quickly again, she will have to just continue playing with the log - she still does like that part."
3,Didn't last very long,"My 5 month old whippet was able to tear apart the stuffed squirrels pretty quick. The tree trunk part of the toy is decent, I forced a softball in it and he likes trying to figure out how to get that out. He still plays with the tree trunk part but the squirrels only lasted about 2 days. I won't be buying from this company again, mostly because I need tougher toys."
4,I holds up,My Shih Tzu destroys most of her toys. This held up pretty well and kept her entertained so I'm happy with the product.
3,"Neat idea, my dog doesn't get it","Maybe it's because he's too big or maybe he's not very smart (I'll never admit that!), but he doesn't get this toy at all. He treats the ""stump"" as it's own toy, and doesn't try to get the squirrels out. Oh well, he enjoys it nonetheless!"
3,Ripped apart too easily,"We just picked this up from the post office a few hours ago, the tree stump is already torn apart and one squirrel is missing a leg and stuffing after about 45 min of playing.Don't get me wrong it's a great toy and keeps our 50lb German Shepard X entertained but she's ripped apart the area between the two holes. Maybe she wanted quicker access to the squirrels but I would have hoped it stayed together longer than 45 min.So, if your dog is a ripper of all things stuffed, this toy doesn't stand a chance."
1,destroyed in minutes,"our dog is a plush toy killer - we learned it with this toy. within minutes the tails were off, then the feet, and then squirrel stuffing guts galore. if your dog is like ours, stay away from wasting your money."
2,Squirrels are not as durrable,"I have ordered the large hide a squirrel in the past and eventually my dog busted through all the squirrels (which is fine we knew he would, but the toy is so cheap that we planned to rebuy). I went for the ginormous version this time to change it up and the squirrels didn't last a day! The seems busted much faster with the ginormous. Also, I have a 60 lb lab mix and he seems to like the large stump more. He doesn't really stick his head in this ginormous one."
2,could be a good toy,But my little dogs ripped the squirrels up within one day. Stuffing everywhere. Why can't they make these more durable. I have resorted to buying other tough little toys to hide in the tree and we still use the stump. I won't bother buying replacement squirrels they are an inferier product. I give the squirrels a 5 for cuteness and a 1 I hate it for durability.
1,dogs did love it,"The dogs really did enjoy this, but did not last with a Lab and Rottweiler. they killed the poor little squirrels in a day or two. It was fun watching them. This would be better for a smaller less destructive breed."
4,Cute but does need supervision if your dog likes to tear things apart like mine.,Cute but does need supervision if your dog likes to tear things apart like mine. My dog is a super chewer and would destuff in an instant if I didn't play with it with her.
5,Golden Retrievers Love It!,"I have two Golden Retrievers who absolutely love this toy. It is the perfect size for them too. They have destroyed other toys in the past in no time at all, but this one is still holding up. They wag their tails when they walk around with the log in their mouth and the baby squirrels poking there little heads out of the log. I would recommend this toy to any dog lover who wants to please their pooch!"
2,Puppy ripped open all the squirrels,"My 3 month old portuguese water dog, loved the squirrels but also loved to play tug of war. So she ripped open all the squirrels fairly quickly and I had to throw them away because there is this green stuffing and plastic squek toy part. She does still have the larger part which is intact. Not good for tug of war."
3,"Cute, but not my dogs liking",I thought this would be a great toy for my Shiba Inu since he likes to stick his nose in holes. When we first introduced it he would just bite the whole thing and shake them out. It actually worked for him. I tried to out smart him and used iron plates and stuffed the bottom. Long story short he rather play with the tree that the squirrels live in instead of the squirrels themselves.
1,Don't believe the ratings!,"I don't know if the quality of the product has diminished over the years, but I wouldn't suggest anyone waste their money on such a poor quality item. I was so excited to receive my package. However, the squirrels barely squeaked. I kept on trying to squeeze them, but all I heard was the puff of air. Wow, what a let down! I knew the price was too good to be true. Sometimes it's true; you get what you pay for. I plan to still let my pet play with the toy. It's not like he knows the toy is suppose to squeak."
4,Kyjen Hide-A-Squirrel Pet Toy,My 2 puppies love playing with this toy. The only drawback was the whiskers that were on the squirrels faces. I had to cut them off because they were made out of a heavy string or wire that possibly could of caused a scratch in the dogs eyes or they could possibly chew off. I have a pug which I have to be careful of because of his eyes somewhat protude out. I do recommend buying this toy but trim the whiskers off of the squirrels.
5,Kyjen Hide-A-Squirrel Puzzle Toy for Dogs,"Purchased this for a Christmas gift; however, our Coton fetched the package, so we just let her open it, with help, of course! She is an 8 pound Coton de Tulear and always barks at real squirrels, so she loves pulling out and making the little fake squirrels squeak. It is a good toy to insert other of her toys and treats inside. Nice gift for someone, who has other of the typical plush toys. Quite well made."
3,Cute but squirrels are dead,"I got the Jr. size for my two yorkies and they loved it. They were having a blast with the squirrels. Unfortunately I had to throw away all three of them because the dogs ripped them open and started taking the stuffing out. I found cotton all over the place and one of the squeaky plastics was on the floor all chewed up. The trunk is fine, thankfully, so I use it to hide other toys in it. They still play with the trunk but are not as in to it as they were with the squirrels."
5,My 6M old 3.6lb Chihuahua baby LOVES this toy! A++++,"Length:: 0:54 MinsOne issue:I did cut the whiskers off.....they are a hazard to her little eyeballs! LOLShe is a 3.6lb Chihuahua and the ""large"" size Hide a Squirrel works great!"
4,Great Concept & Fun,"I bought the large toy for my Maltese and I'm glad I did! He is relativly small, weighs 4.5 pounds, and this toy is the perfect size for him. He can almost fit his whole head in the holes where the squirrels are, and enjoys pulling them out. The squirrels themselves are the perfect size for him also. He likes to carry them around and he enjoys the squeaker aspect of them as well. It is a little bit too easy to do as it only takes about a minute to pull all of the squirrels out, but he does like playing with just the squirrels as well."
3,too easy,It took my dog what seemed like less than a minute to extract the chipmunks from the house. Not a challenging toy at all for my poodle/bichon mix. The chipmunks and their house are well made.
4,"Didn't keep my dog occupied, but cute toy","Cute toy, but I had hoped it would keep my puppy occupied a little while. My 5 month old Golden Doodle puppy had all 3 squirrels out of the ""tree"" in about 15 seconds.It is a good toy for training ""fetch"" or ""get the squirrel"" and ""drop""."
2,Didn't Last Long.....,I got the large toy even though I have a minature poodle cause I figured this would be made tougher since it was suppose to be for larger dogs. The first day he started playing with this he loved it. And we had tons of fun playing. By the end the night the fun was done however. He had two squirrels ripped apart on top which appeared to be a seam area. He doesn't have much interest in it now with just one squirrel left. If this was meant for larger dogs they really should of made the stitching much stronger.
3,Great for Non Chewers,"I begrudgingly give this toy a 3 star rating. I was so excited when this arrived and I just knew it would keep my dog (a shih tzu) entertained for hours on end. Such was not the case. She figured out real fast how to get the squirrels out of the tree trunk. However, she then proceeded to chew and tear open the stuffed squirrels. I highly recommend this if your dog is not a chewer that destroys all of their toys. The tree trunk part is still intact so I put her other toys in it to let her dig out. I know that they sell replacement squirrels but I see no need to do that since she'll have them torn up within a matter of minutes. Otherwise, I'd rate this toy a 5 star rating."
5,Lightweight and fun!,My dog really likes to play with the house not so much the smaller squirrels. I know you are supposed to take some time to teach them how to play with the hide-a-squirrels. I put some treats in there and he has so many other small dog toys that he wasn't really excited. He flips and tosses the house and runs after it. He really likes it but not for the purpose of the hide a squirrel part LOL. Whatever. It is super light and it rolls around.
2,Not Good for Large Dog,"Our dog loved the toy, but it took under five minutes for it to be torn through. Not a great buy for large dogs."
1,"Dog loves the toy, but's it is a piece of crap.","Multiple attempts to get assistance or even a response from the manufacturer (phone, email, letter) have been useless. I have a 3 pound Yorkie who totally destroyed the squirrels within the first two hours of playing with it. The dog loved the toy and I bought the large model (for my tiny dog) thinking it would help the durability. If my 3 pound Yorkie can destroy these squirrels that fast, I'd hate to see how long they last with a bigger dog. Great toy for engaging and stimulating the dog. The quality of the materials is horrible. The response from the company is nothing."
1,Not challenging- just buy any small stuffed toy,I tried this with my toller and it took him about 15seconds to remove all squirrels from the tree. Sure he loves the small squirrels and just carrying around the big trunk but he could have the same excitement from any small squeaky toys. I was hoping that it would take him a bit longer to get the squirrels out but alas it takes me longer to stuff them in.
1,"2nd review submitted, still have not received the iten that I ordered","This is the second time that I have submitted a review without any results. Ordered the ""JUMBO"" hide a squirrel ( check sellers advertisement ) , received the regular size.After Amazon contacted the seller, they called and stated that the Jumbo dog toy would be sent to me with a mail it back label to send the original toy back.It's Sept. 27th- haven't received anything ?????Edward S. Baker"
2,Very destructible,"My puppy destroyed this toy in minutes. Labrador retriever tore out the lining of the ""tree"" and began eating it. The squirrel/chipmunk's whiskers stuck in his throat and the squeakers were history. Very entertaining toy for five minutes."
4,Not Interested!?,"I am giving this toy four stars because it is cute and durable, but my dog was simply not interested. She is a fan of plush toys and I thought she would have fun trying to remove the squirrels, but she mostly just ignored it."
3,Hide-a-toy-squirrel,"We bought one of these three years ago for our dog. It was a wonderful toy, he could not destroy it! Well after three years only one of the squirrels stopped squeaking and the thing got pretty smelly from constant use from our pet. We decided to treat him to a new one. Well the quality of the toy has sure changed over the past three years. The log is already ripped and the stuffing is coming out. The squirrels aren't of the same quality either. You can just look at them and tell how much cheaper they have gotten. I was dissapointed at the change but my dog can't tell the difference. He still oves the thing. One of his favorite toys. I guess you should ask him to write a review? Thanks,"
1,Lasted Only a Few Minutes,"I saw all the good reviews on the Hide a Squirrel so I bought it for my 10 lb Westie puppy. She must have really sharp teeth or the toy is junk. She had it ripped in minutes, she enjoyed it but I had to take it away and throw it away because she ripped the trunk up in no time at all. I feel like I took my money and ripped it up. I guess her teeth are just stronger than other dog's but she destroyed it in minutes and I feel really cheated out of the money I spent and feel bad that I had to throw out something she was enjoying but she was pulling it apart in tiny pieces and I was afraid she'd swallow it. I had the same issue with another of this companie's toys so I won't buy another. I'll get her the cheap ones from Walmart, at least I don't feel so bad when they are ripped up. I sent a letter of complaint to the company but I am sure I'll never hear back from them."
1,not durable,"My puppy (Rhodesian Ridgeback) was able to pull all the squirrels out within a few minutes. Furthermore, within 5 hours of playing, she had the stuffing torn out of 2 of the 3 squirrels."
3,Fun toy but not durable,Just got it in the mail today! Our 4 month puppy has been enthusiastic since it came out of the box! But sadly after about 2 hours he's already killed 2 out of the 3 squirrels.
5,FABULOUS PER TOY!,"My 11 mos., 11 lb., malti-poo puppy ABSOLUTELY LOVES THIS TOY!! She keeps herself busy pulling the 3 squirrels out for at least an hour if not more. Then plays another 1/2 hr.tossing & running around with the squirrels. She loves that the squirrels squeak too. I also bought the same toy, but The Bumble Bees. I switch off from day to day so she doesn't get bored of one. BUY THIS TOY!!!! P.S. My 4-legged Granddaughter- who is at least 45 lbs. loves these toys also!"
5,This is the BEST toy!,"My 5 month old puppy didn't really play with any of her toys UNTIL I got this in the mail! She LOVES it and will play with it for over an hour.........so amazing! She carries it with her everywhere, which is funny because she is only 6 lbs. What a GREAT product!"
2,"Cute, but quickly destroyed","While a cute set and fun to play with our 10lb chihuhua/daschund mix, re-inserting the little critters for him to retrieve again, leaving him to play with this alone for 15 minutes ended up with stuffing spread around and the tree trunk left shredded open... This is not for any chewers without supervision."
2,NOT for medium or bigger dogs,"So two of the squirrels lasted for (drum roll please)................ 5 minutes tops. Wow I was frustrated. I thought the squirrels were stuck inside the tree and when the dog went to grab them they retreated inside. Instead, the squirrels come out and can be completely chewed. One squirrel got lost under the couch so it lasted for awhile. The tree itself was more fun for the dog as it was bigger. The tree lasted for 3 weeks before the stuffing started flying out. Boooo this toy! I would have given this product 1 star if the tree did not last for 3 weeks. The dog actually got some entertainment out of that."
2,plush,It is a cute toy and my dog loves it.....maybe too much.. the plush tree trunk part that you put the squirrel/chipmunks in was destroyed in a matter of minutes by my 7 month old Westie. She loves the squirrels and has removed the tail from one of them already.. was a fun toy for a minute.
3,For puppies or small dogs,My 7 year old Golden is not interested in this toy at all. She just picks up the whole stump and carries it around.
2,Not Great,"My dog really loved this toy, BUT the squirrels are in pieces after 3 days! And my dog is a tiny little fellow (chihuahua/corgi mix)."
5,Good chew toy,"Bought this for Christmas and now have had this for about 4 months. At that time, we had 4 dogs. The two youngest (a 5 yo chihuahua and a 8 yo maltese) both enjoyed it. Recently we got a papillon puppy. The puppy adores this toy. She plays with it every day. The toy has held up very well. She seems to have a lot of fun pulling the squirrels out and playing with them and then beating up on the nest. None show any wear or tear. It's still soft and the dogs still enjoy it."
3,Puzzle for my dog.....,"I put a treat in the bottom, demonstrated with removing the squirrels, and he watched. He knew how to get the treat by removing the top squirrel and rooted around throught the top hole for the treat. He had his whole face inside at one time! We are still learning ! But a fun toy for both of us.....and he likes the little squirrels just for chewing. I am sure he will eventually remove all three squirrels to get the treat....."
4,Dog loved it a little too much,"I wasn't sure if my dog would like this or get the point of it, but I bought it given all the good reviews on Amazon. My dog absolutely loves this toy and will endlessly pull out the squirrels. She has been entertained by this toy longer than other things I have bought for her in the past. However, my one complaint is that the squirrels are easily torn apart and one had lost its stuffing and squeaker by the second day. But if they could make the same thing with a more chew resistant fabric, I would definitely buy it!"
1,Waste of money!,"I learned a lesson as my dog is newly adopted - no more fabric toys of any kind. 3 year old lab mix tore this thing apart in less than 5 minutes. He's not aggressive at all, but likes things that squeak. I didn't expect it to last forever, but this was ridiculous. Literally just a few bites and the stitching was split open and stuffing was flying. Save your money!"
2,Disappointed.,"My dog simply doesn't care for this toy. He likes the squirrels, but after lots of effort to get him excited, I will put the squirrel in the trunk, and then he will try for 5 seconds to get it out of the trunk, but then give up. It's a cute idea, though."
3,"Loved it, but...","Our Springer Spaniel loved it. For 2 whole days. When it was completely destroyed. A few of the squirrels/chipmunks have survived and he's playing with those until they split open and are ruined also. He is young, but doesn't chew that much and most of his stuffed animals last quite a long time so I was very disappointed in this. I Think part of the design problem is that there are a lot of seams which split open easily. If it had fewer seams, there would be fewer weak points. But, he did love looking for the squirrels and as a super smart pup will look for his squirrels if you tell him to. I may just buy a few of the ""refills"" since he did love them, knowing they're essentially a disposable toy."
5,Hide a Squirrel!,"This was a HUGE hit with my Basset, Charlie! It's always the first toy he heads for in the morning.. I have to beat him there to put the squirrels back in.. HE LOVES THIS TOY!!!"
1,Dont Waste your money with HideASquirrel toy,"The Hide-A-Squirrel pet toy is very cute and come in a nice box. I have 2 young boston terriers; one is 10 lbs. the other is 15 lbs. Both dogs started to play with it right away.I kid you not, 15 minutes after giving this toy to my dogs, I went into the bedroom and found stuffing material everywhere on the floor. Yes, they had a blast with it. Only problem, it is not built to last. I gave it 1 star because it looks good in the box and displays it attractively."
5,A winner!,Great toy . Our dog crazy about it. Lets them be a little mentally challenged. Our dog tends to be a chewer so not as long lasting as we would like but affordable to replace and it's the favorite go to toy
3,Fun but poorly made,"Our 1 yr old Cavachon loves the new toy. It didn't take her long to figure out how to pull the squirrels out, but she enjoys playing with each one individually. I only gave it 3 stars because some of the seams were already coming apart, after about 10-15 minutes of playing. Our puppy is around 14 lbs, so she's fairly small, which means the toy was not constructed well. Unfortunately, we'll probably have to throw some of the squirrels away soon."
5,my dog loved this toy for a long time,"Our dog, Walter, loved this toy. He knew exactly what to do with it and worked on the puzzle until he had extracted and sufficiently tortured the chipmonks. Then he would bring us the trunk and wait for it to be reloaded. The fabric was tough and the chipmonks survived all the tug-o-wars. Most toys will give up their fluff in less than an hour. Walter, however, did successfully destroy the trunk... it took many hours and nothing will withstand a determined chewer like Walter. We are definitely buying another... perhaps a different puzzle but the same brand. Great product!"
3,Not for Chewers,"This cute toy has 3 squirrels in a tree stump, all filled toys, of course. My miniature Schnauzer enjoyed ""hunting"" the squirrels, but quickly figured out how to get them out of the various holes. He then proceeded to rip each one's tail off, then rip apart each squirrel, ""de-stuff"" them, and leave stuffing all over the floor. It's a cute toy, but no good for aggressive chewers!"
2,Very cute,"The squirrel tower is adorable, funny and a great idea. The squirrels were destroyed in 1.5 minutes. My dogs tore them up faster than most of their toys. It was funny to watch them but depressing it lasted such a short time. The tower however is still in one piece. My Jack Russells think nothing of pulling out the squirrels and tearing out the guts. I am now left with stuffing everywhere and squeakers shreddded."
4,Great Pet Toy,My dog loved this toy and it is well made for a pet that like to chew up toys.He loves to take them out of the tree house.
2,Not quite as entertaining for my dog,"The Hide-A-Squirrel toy is designed to encourage your dog to interact with it by enticing the dog to try and get all of the squirrels out of the tree stump. Unfortunately my dog didn't have any interest in taking the squirrels out of the tree, as much as I encouraged him, although he was interested in the squirrels themselves. He just tossed the tree stump around for a bit, and the little squirrels were chewed to pieces within minutes."
5,Great fun for dogs,"I bought two of these for my three dogs to share. They love playing with the squeaky squirrels by themselves as well as inside the tree toy. Suzy, my pit bull, likes to take one little squirrel in her mouth and make it squeak over and over - to the point where she whines and growls at the little squirrel, something I've never seen her do with any other toy."
4,Stump you very much,"My dog thinks this is great. She's a Belgian/Border Collie and doesn't chew much but she does love to get the squeaker going.The little squirrels are fun and I bought extra although I didn't need to, they are all in perfect shape. The stump that they came in is fairing nicely too although the bottom contains some kind of plastic that is covered by the cloth and she also likes to chomp on this for some kind of doggie pleasure. It has gotten a little bent out of shape but you can still shove the squirrels inside and she goes to town removing them."
4,My Mini Dachshunds love this.,"We have both the small and large sized trunks for our mini dachshunds and they love them. It did not take them very long to figure out how to get the squirrels out, but I just stuff the trunks full of other toys to make it more challenging for them. My only complaint is that they were able to shred the fur off of the littlest squirrels very quickly - they are not so much into breaking into stuffing as ripping off surface details. The fact that the squirrels are now bald doesn't seem to bother them and it is still a favorite toy."
3,Hide-a-squirrel,"OK but chewed squirrels ears off first,pulled out stuffing.Eating the cardboard in the bottom of the 'tree' I had to remove that.I use the 'tree' to put other rubber squeaky toys in for her to try to pull out.So I guess it wasn't a complete waste of money."
1,began to fall apart within 10 minutes,"One of the squirrels began unraveling along the top seam (it was NOT chewed through by our dog) within 10 minutes of play. We have had conventional stuffed animals as dog toys that have lasted years.Aside from falling apart, it seemed like an ok toy. The dogs (a 7 year old Blue Healer mix, and a 9 year old pit mix) figured out how to get the squirrels out within about 2 minutes, but were still enjoying themselves chewing on the squeaky little squirrels. It was a bit too easy for them though, and if I were to buy another one (which I'm not, since the quality is crap) I'd probably get one of the toys with a single hole."
5,Dogs love this!,"I don't know what it is about this toy but my dogs love this! Anytime I put the ""squirrels"" in they will await eagerly for me to put it on the ground. They even go after the trunk when the squirrels have been taken out already. I have a chihuahua mix and an yorkie mix and I ordered the small size. It was really tiny and at first I thought I would return it as I thought there was no way the yorkie could get in there and get them out but eventually I put it down just to see. I was pleasantly surprised to see his enthusiasm and the fact he could actually get to those squirrels. Now if they look bored I stuff the squirrels in and squeak them a few times tell them to ""get the squirrel"" and they are off. Great Toy!"
5,Made big dog very silly- and kept him busy,"Tucker, our very large shepherd/whatever dog has not torn this up yet. We keep stuffing the squirrels back into the tree trunk, plus other toys too. He throws it in the air, rolls on it and can get very focused on taking things out of it. He usually can destroy toys-- remove squeakers etc in very short order. This is still intact. It is a great toy. BTW all the squirrels squeak!"
3,Great concept that needs better construction,The idea makes this better than the average dog toy but the little animals within need to be more durable.My dogs have loved it and I can get more little toys to put in it but the squirrels should have been durable enough to make it more than a couple of days.
3,"Nice toy, not for a CHEWER","This was a nice toy. The dog loved it. She also destroyed it within 15 minutes. She is a 27 pound mixed pup. This is not the toy for a stronger chewer. If your dog doesn't destroy stuffed toys, this would be a very nice toy for them."
1,Disinterested and destroyed,"I have a Golden Retriever who is almost 8. He's not particularly destructive. I gave him the squirrels about 45 minutes ago. He's not really interested, they're lying next to him now, with some in the trunk and he's not bothered about removing them because he has one little one ripped open next to him. He had about 10 minutes of enjoying squeaking them and then destroyed two by chewing on them. The $5 Petsmart toys survive for few months longer than this did (all of 30 minutes). Disappointing. After good reviews I'd hoped he might find this fun."
2,supervision only,"My dog's single purpose in life seems to be the removal of squeakers from toys. This product did not last long. BUT after squeaker & stuffing removal I was able to triage the squirrels with a few stitches and they have managed to hang around. The same cannot be said for the stump/house thing. The bottom is filled with cardboard, which my dog discovered and chewed into tiny, wet pieces. The stump was trashed.Mangled, amputee squirrels still going."
4,fun doggie toy.,"our mini dachshund loves this product. she enjoys pulling the squirrels out of the trunk. only issue is that the toys can tears, so watch your pup."
3,"Good for some dogs, not all.","I have three dogs; two Chihuahuas and a papillon. The chihuahuas like soft, cuddly toys and are gently with them. The papillon destroyed all three squirrels (and ate, then proceeded to yack up one when I turned away for a few moments.) Moral of the story; if your dogs are well behaved, and do well with other stuffed animals, get it; it's great for them. If your dog makes it his mission to destroy any toy, this won't last long."
3,Love the concept but,"My dog absolutely loves navigating the baby squirrels out of the 'tree'; however, the squirrels are poorly made and don't last long at all. Three of the six were torn within 30 minutes of play and had to be thrown away. It's a shame, as she is really enjoying playing with this toy.Three stars for durabilityFive stars for fun"
3,Lower quality than expected,"This toy is okay, but if I knew what I know now, I would not have purchased it. It's smaller than I was imagining (although I admittedly didn't check the dimensions before buying), and it seems rather poorly made. The tree stump part of the toy has an area where it wasn't properly sewed, so there is an open gap. The bottom of the stump is made of a hard material to keep its form, and I worry about our chewer making it to the level and injuring herself if we are not monitoring her with it. I have purchased cheaper toys that my dogs like just as much--if not more--that also appear to be better constructed."
5,Very well made,My dog loves this toy. He has a lot of energy and this toy keeps him busy for awhile. He likes both just toss the squeaky squirrels around and finding them in the tree. My 22-month old son also loves to play with it;)
3,Dog Loved it but tore it up,"My 7-8 month old golden retriever (yes they are very ""mouthy"" pups), loved this toy.We stuffed the squirrels in over and over and he would get them out.Within a couple of weeks I had ""squirrel"" skins lying around each time I came home.He would rip there heads off and unstuff them.Great while it lasted (about 3 weeks). Still have the tree part and you can actually stuff it with any toy your dog likes."
4,Great and fun,Great and fun product. My dog looooved digging for the little squirrels!!!Not very durable however. Already ripped all of the squirrels and now is in the midst of ripping the stuffed tree part...
3,Great toy but NOT for a chewer,"My dog absolutely loved this....for the 30 minutes it took him to destroy it. I have an 80lb Husky who LOVES squeaky toys. He can get really destructive so I try to find toys that will provide him some mental stimulation. He had a great time getting the squirrels out and chewing on them but he ripped up their ""house"" within 30 minutes. If your dog is not destructive like mine then this is definitely an awesome toy for them."
4,Chipmunk missles,"Other than being chipmunks rather than squirrels, this is a pretty cute toy. We stuff extra toys in it to make the fit tighter, since my pit/lab mix's delicate extraction method is to shake it with a couple of G-forces until the chipmunks / tigers / whatever else we've stuffed in, fly out. One chipmunk flew up and hit the ceiling.....so they do end up getting pretty scattered around the house."
3,nice toy,"This is a good concept however, my dog is also too smart for this toy. She is a bischon frise, and she found out how to get the little stuff animals out. She picks up the bottle of the trunk with her mouth and shakes all of the little critters out. It's a good toy, but for my dog it is okay. The toy seem to not hold her interest or attention very long."
2,Toys are fragile,"My dog loves the toys. Tears them out of the stump cheerfully. The issue is that she also pulled the stuffing and squeaker out within 10 minutes. So six squirrels would make about and hour of play time. My dog is not huge, about 45 pounds. Was hoping for better durability...."
5,My dog loves it,I got it to fill an ordee for free shipping and it was more then worth it. I like to stick treats and other toys he enjoys in the tree. He loves it.
3,My dog loved it!,"I purchased this product for my Min Pin. He loved it to death! I think he especially liked the way he could carry it around in his mouth. However, as much as he loved it, once he got past about 8 months old, I had to take it away from him, because he started ripping it to shreds; therefore, it wasn't safe for him to play with.As far as fun for the dog goes, I would rate it a 5; however, when it comes to durability it only gets a 3. I would not recommend this toy for a dog that rips stuffed animals apart, because it will be history before the hour is up.Perhaps, when my dog gets older, as he is now 14 months old, and when/IF he stops that phase of tearing it to shreds, I would definitely buy it again."
4,Good toy,"I usually put several plush toys and some treats into this toy. When my maltese was a puppy, he would remove a couple toys and then roll the tree stump in order to have the treats fall out. Very entertaining for my maltese to play with.It doesn't seem to be durable for heavy chewers, so I'd recommend to monitor your dog(s) when playing with this toy.My other dog a poodle mix was really good at chewing off the ears of the squirrels and the fluff out of their tails. Although the squirrels lasted a while, they eventually lost the fight!"
5,LITTLE DOGS LOVED THEM,"Bought these as a gift for friends two little puppies, they would get their head stuck in them trying to get the squirrels or snack out of the tree. They got faster and faster each time. They love the squirrels too."
2,"Great toy, shame about the stitching","I purchased this toy for my 7-month-old Border Collie and had it sent on to me in New Zealand by a friend in the US. Unfortunately, this means I'd need to jump through hoops (and big shipping expense) to return it or it would be on its way back.The packaging arrived in perfect condition but on opening the box I noticed that one of the squirrels had stuffing poking out of its head. On closer inspection it was obvious that the stitching hasn't been done properly. Two of the squirrels have holes and need to be sewn up before my puppy can play with it.I bought the Jumbo size in the hope that my dog would get plenty of playtime with the toy and its very disappointing that the quality is so poor. Thankfully, I noticed these before my dog got to play with the toy as I doubt she would have been able to resist pulling the stuffing out!"
1,toy lasted 10 min,I got this as a gift or a joke My 100 pound dog didn't hesitate he ripped it apart quickly.I guess he doesn't like cute cuddly squirrels...
1,"Just received the item, squeaky does not work!!!","Edit: so I exchanged it but unfortunately, my dog doesnt like it at all. After the initial time she played with it - 5 minutes at most, it is just sitting in the corner and has not been touched since we received the product.Shopped for over $100 worth of toys for my doggie! Because of rave reviews, I ordered this along with many other toys. Due note that I just received this item about an hour ago! I gave it to my 10 lb shih tzu to play with. After 5 minutes of playing with it, I noticed that one of the squirrel's squeaky no longer worked. She literally played with it for 5 minutes!!!! Grrrrr!!!!! What a waste!!!!"
4,Awesome!,"I have a 10pound toy fox terrier who thinks he is a fearless hunter of squirrels and he LOVES this! It is like a squirrel dispenser - he can get one whenever he wants. He especially enjoys it if I hold onto the log and keep re-stuffing squirrels into the top and squeeking them from the inside. Sometimes he gets so excited we have to take a break.One small caution, however, the squirrels' whiskers (which are made of a black fishing-line type stuff) can come out when chewing on the squirrels - especially if your dog likes to floss. I think they are long enough to be dangerous if swallowed (in a small dog, anyway, I can't speak for bigger pooches but probably best avoided for any furry friend...). Easy workaround was to just snip and remove them all for safer play. If not for this safety issue, I would give this 5 stars!"
3,Dog loves it but final hand stitching is poor,"Our 4 month old Labrador puppy absolutely LOVES this toy. She's a light chewer and loves to play with her toys rather than tear them up or perform a squeakectomy to remove the squeakers.However, there is one significant flaw to the squirrels. On all three of the squirrels, the final hand stitching on the backs are poor at best. On one of the squirrels there's only two stitches to close a 1"" gap. On another the stitching is loose and on the third the stitching came apart within minutes, only pulling out the squirrels a few times.I'm giving this toy 3 stars instead of 1 star because I think I can fix the squirrels pretty easily. And because our puppy loves playing with it so much it's worth it. Keeps her busy and saves all of our things that she's not supposed to be chewing on!! If you buy this I'd recommend taking a few minutes to inspect the back stitching and maybe even reinforce it before giving it to your dog."
5,amazing gift for my Yorkie,"I've bought this toy for my 3 month old Yorkie and she loves it so much, size was junior, exactly for her: )"
5,Review of Hide-a-Squirrel,My two dogs love this toy. They play with it for hours and somehow manage not to completely rip it apart.They both even brought a squirrel with them into their dogs beds a few nights. I highly recommend it to other dog owners.
3,"a little too small, but otherwise good toy","It's a little too small for my mini-schnauzer and he's more interested in playing fetch with the tree than trying to get the squirrels out. He likes it, but would probably be better for a smaller dog."
5,Great buy!,"This is a great toy. It keeps my Yorkie busy. She figured out pretty quickly how to get the squirrels out, but loves doing it over and over, and also plays with them separately."
3,Our dogs love it,"Our dogs go crazy over this item, unfortunately it doesn't last very long. They usually have the squirrels gutted and ripped apart within hours. The nest takes a little longer, but before they masacre it, I am able to hide other toys in it. They love this."
3,Very Fun - Very Cute - Not Durable,"Our 1-year old doxies think that pulling the chipmunks out of the trunk is loads of fun -- then they immediately go into ""tear the little critter to shreds"" - and they would if we let them. So far we have been using this toy for short periods of time that are mostly supervised. So far all of the chipmunks have their little legs torn off, the knob on the stump is de-stuffed, and one squeaker is mangled. BUT it is such a cute toy - - and they really do have fun digging the little critters out. I don't know how long we'll ""supervise"" them with this toy before we let them destroy it. It was a Christmas gift and it's now 1 week after Christmas. It was fun while it lasted!"
1,NOT RECOMMENDED FOR 45 POUND PLUS LABRADOR RETRIEVER,"This review is for Kyjen PP01058 Hide-A-Squirrel Pet Toy, JUMBO SIZE.My dog WINNIE enjoyed getting a new toy for CHRISTMAS! First, I inspected the SQUIRRELS which didn't seem all that durable. She promptly found one of the SQUIRRELS in less than 10 seconds. The only problem was IT'S HEAD CAME OFF AS SOON AS SHE PULLED IT OUT! I quickly replaced this product with her KONG TOY which has lasted for over [2] years. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS TOY FOR LARGE DOGS"
5,Best dog toy ever! especially if you have multiple dogs.,"I have 3 dogs, rottweiler, pomeranian and a Chihuahua. This was there Xmas present and boy was it a hit! There was a squeeky toy for each of them plus the ""tree stump"". They all love it! They love pulling the squirrels out of the tree, stealing them from each other and the Chihuahua will even try to put the squirrels back in the tree.Great toy!"
2,Cute Toy but Not Chew Proof,"After purchasing the Kyjen 6 squeaker snake from PetsMart and realizing that it was a great toy I quickly looked up Kyjen online and found/purchased several other toys. One of which was the large hide-a-squirrel toy. The website never claimed that this toy was chew resistant and I should have known better but it was too cute to pass up. I have an American Bulldog/Chow mix with razor sharp teeth at the peak of her puppy chewing stage. I quickly realized that she was going to destroy this toy within a day so I took it away from her after a half an hour of play time. On a positive note, she loved this toy until I took it away from her. She really enjoyed pulling the little squirrels out of the tree trunk. I ended up leaving the toy with my mom, a squirrel lover, for her cats. Surprisingly, her cats love this toy just as much as my dog did so it worked out just fine. I would recommend this product to someone with a dog that doesn't try to chew up their toys."
5,Great Toy For Soft-mouthed Dogs,"We have a 80 pound 10 year old golden retriever/lab mix and she loves this toy. We had to encourage her to play with it at first, but now she gets it! We have had the toy for 9 months now and it's holding up well. Only recently a tail on one of the squirrels has started to come loose. The squirrels have held up much longer than other dog toys we have bought in the past, so we plan to order a set of replacement squirrels as our dog seems to really enjoy rooting them out of the tree trunk."
1,Fell apart in 15 minutes,"We have a one year old Giant Schnauzer who needs to chew and he inhales rawhide, so after reading reviews I thought it sounded sturdy... 15 minutes after getting the toy, which is really cute & he loved it, my daughter was sewing it back together. I know he's a big powerful boy, this toy is not for big dogs."
5,Hours of Fun!,Perfect size for my Maltese. He loves pulling out the squirrels inside and playing with them. He never tires of 'hunting' then out :)
3,Bara,"it is a great toy for small dogs,my pitbull girl took all the whistles out of the babies and then lost interest.Maybe if I put another squeakers inside again she may get into it,Right now I am stuffing it with her other stuff,but its not as exiting for her anymore since she enjoys tearing something apart,oh well I tried!"
1,Did not even last an hour,"My 20 pound dog destroyed this cheap piece of garbage after playing with it for less than an hour. The ""trunk"" part of the toy was ripped apart and its stuffing pulled out with no effort at all. I blame cheap stitching. What a waste of money. I would recommend instead getting some durable squeak toys and skipping this product. I honestly have no idea why it is the highest rated dog toy on Amazon."
1,Dont be fooled! Do not buy!!!,"I purchased this for my 1 year old small dog. I've purchased several dog toys on Amazon and never had a problem. I thought this was cute and would be great. But there are major problems with this toy. Listed below:1. The ""fake"" whiskers on each of the squirrels are cheap plastic strips that came off in the first day and I had to prevent my dog from chewing/eating it!!!2. My dog enjoyed it for a while when he didn't know how to take the squirrels out at first, but then every 5 seconds I have to put all 3 in the thing because it's way to easy to get them out. Not much enjoyed really. So basically you just get a stuffed jar and 3 little squeakers. :(3. After only a WEEK! All 3 of the squirrels are ripped to shreds and my dog got all the stuffing and plastic squeaker thing out of them. What a waste of money. Very poorly made... Stuffing everywhere I had to pick up and throw away."
2,Had potential,"My puppy loved this, she wouldn't stop playing with it for 30 minutes, however within that time one of the squekers caved in and doesn't work anymore."
5,great activity for dogs,my little boston terrier tears up every toy she owns but these squirrels really hold up. she loves pulling the squirrels out to find the treats i hide underneath them. i also own the hide-a-bee and they are both great products
3,question,this is my first time shopping and im being asked for a commercial invoice for this toy.. can someone tell me how to get one?
5,Great doggie fun,It's a great toy for a dog if they are not of a destructive nature. Our dog is gentle but did destroy the log house. However she still has the 3 squirrels and loves them because they are small and easy to carry around in her mouth. She loves to squeak them! We just hide them under pillows and blankets and the game is on!
5,Its a favorite!,My chihuahua loves this toy! The junior size is just perfect. We stuff treats inside under the squirrels and give it to him when we are leaving the house. It also keeps him occupied for a while when he's full of energy. He's not a chewer and doesn't have strong jaws so he's not as interested in getting the squirrels out to attack. So it works best for us with the treats. I definitely recommend and will buy again!
3,Fun while it lasts,I bought this toy probably 8 months ago.I still have the tree. The squirrels lasted about 5 minutes each.The dogs loved the toy but just destroyed all the squirrels.Its even worse if you have more than one dog.These squirrels will be ripped apart within minutes once the tug a war starts.
5,Awesome toy!,"I got the large, because my dog is small, but I wanted him to have something to actually be able to hold on to. This item was fantastic - my dog loves it, I hide little treats in it with the squirrels in it, and he plays with it and bats it around until he gets the treats. I'm always looking for a toy to keep my little guy interested, and this did it!"
5,What a cute toy,I bought this for our grand doggies for Christmas and it was really fun watching them pull the little animals out of the house. It wasn't played with much (at least in my presence) but the initial joy was there.
2,Not recommended for chewers,"This was fun for my dogs for the first few minutes but then all they want to do is chew up the squirrels, which are not very durable. So I constantly have to take then away from them. If your dog likes to chew on their toys I wouldn't recommend."
5,Love this toy and so does the Boxer,My 55lb Boxer is a stuffed toy destroyer but he's played with this many times a day since Christmas and only popped one squeaker. Other reviewers talked about the mess from being ripped up and that's what I expected but it's inexpensive enough I didn't care. Nothing ripped yet! The Ginormous isn't really that big. When I restuff it he loves to shake the trunk and watch the squirrels fly everywhere. It's been well worth the money.
3,Poor Quality Construction,"I bought this for my golden retriever and he absolutely loves it; however, it arrived with one squeaker broken in one of the squirrels. Within a week the other two squirrels' seams were coming apart on their backs and a seam is opening up on the bottom of the log. My dog is not rough with the toy so I can't blame him for it. I stitched everything back up and it seems to be holding together. Overall, poorly made toy but my dog loves it so I guess I can't complain."
3,Maybe a little more sewing?,"I have a very big Labradoodle who just destroys stuffed animals. He LOVES squeaky stuffed animals more than any other toy. It's hard to find one of good quality construction that will last more than 10 minutes under his powerful jaws. And I've found that paying $20 for a large ""good"" toy doesn't seem to matter much. These are middle of the line constructed. The squirrels were torn from the ""trunk"" w/in minutes. The squirrels were tail-less w/in an hour. He still plays with the ""carcasses"" though so that's a bonus. A little more time spent on seems and sewing the squirrels inside to the trunk would be great. And every time I put the squirrels back into the trunk he had them out in a matter of seconds. Maybe smaller holes in the trunk section would be helpful to make the toy more interactive? Not a total loss but I had higher hopes."
3,"Great concept, but squirrels are pretty weak.","Love the idea of this toy, but within minutes of opening it on Christmas morning our miniature beagle destroy one squirrel. By the day after Christmas all three were shredded. The issue I have with this is that the holes were not from the fabric tearing, but from the stitching across the backs of the squirrels easily coming apart with very little effort. The same applies to the stitching holding the tails to the body. The tree stump has held up, but then the dog does not really play with it much. We now use it to put other toys and tennis balls in it."
2,Abby not really taken with this . . .,"and the first day she pulled a string on one little squirrel and next I knew there was STUFFING to get away from her! Also, even though Kyjen's website tells you about Kyle and Jennifer it does NOT disclose these toys are made in CHINA!"
4,Surprisingly my dog hasn't murdered all the squirrels yet...,"This pet toy is very cute. I showed it off to a couple of different friends and they both immediately ordered one from Amazon. The quality is excellent. Very detailed construction. The squirrels/chipmunks whatever you prefer are adorable. Our dog is a 70 pound German short hair that lives to tear all of the stuffing out of every toy we buy her. Immediately!! Most toys last less than an hour and then she carries around the pelt. She's been playing with these since Christmas and only this evening decided to rip into one of the squirrels but didn't really finish the job. He (the squirrel) is just sort of gimpy at the moment and holding on to a ""shred"" of his former self. She does like to chew on the lip of the stump now and then. Which I don't really think the manufacturer had in mind but she completely ignores me when I tell her that. Not sure how long it will last. Good product. We got it on sale before Christmas so good price as well."
2,Figured it out!,My dog mastered this toy in about 30 seconds. It's not very difficult to pull the squirrels out of it. It certainly doesn't keep him occupied by himself! He just treats it like any other squeaky toy.
3,4 Toys in 1.,"I liked that this toy came with 3 squeaking squirrels and a tree trunk for them to go in. My dog enjoys shredding toys so I thought this might be a good toy to try to refocus his energy.He likes the squirrels and will pull one out and play with it. So far, it's still all in one piece which is good for him. My only issue and why this received 3 stars is because the hole on the top of the trunk is too large. If I get my dog to focus on the sides, it will take him a little big of time to remove one. But if he goes through the top, there is no struggle for him.The toy still makes a great deal having the 3 squirrels and the trunk. The trunk could be used to hold other items for the dog to remove. I was considering trying to find something that would be difficult to get out of the top hole but we shall see."
4,Hours of Entertainment,"My dog, Charlie, instantly fell in love with this toy!! Not only that, but he enjoyed playing with it for over an hour--he usually loses interest within five minutes). It's so much fun to watch him play with. The only problem is that Charlie was able to destroy the squeakers in the stuffed squirrels pretty quickly. Even with the squirrels no longer squeaking, he still enjoys playing with this! The replacement squirrels are more expensive than the toy itself, so I've ordered extras of this item instead. This is truly a great toy!"
4,"pup loves it, but...","my pup loves the toy, but within 2 weeks one of the squirrels got torn apart. i will be sewing it back together.. other than that, its a great toy, keeps her busy. oh and its also wonderful that they sell replacement squirrels, too."
3,The squirels are all eaten up,I know my border collie loves squirels so I bought this great toy for her but she had all the squirells tore up in a matter of minutes I would love to see this product in a rubber form so she wouldnt be able to destroy them so quickly
5,GREAT!!,This really is a great toy. My dachshund plays with this thing for hours and hours. She doesn't seem to care about any other toy now. Only bad thing is i wish they had more then 3 spots to put the toys. My dachshund takes out the squirrels in mins and expects me to restock them.
4,Poodle figured it our too fast. And later news:,"My standard poodle loves this, but he takes about 14 seconds to get all the squirrels out of it. He likes to get them out, give them to me and have me toss them down the hall. Goes crazy when they are all in and I reach in and squeak one of them. Fun toy, but was hoping for more challenge.Later comment:This was destroyed way too soon. Not recommended for any dog with teeth!"
4,Well made toy,The toy appears to be well made. Our dog likes to play with the squirrels but has yet to really get the hang of pulling them out of the log. The toy was worth the price I paid.
2,"its called ""Ginormous"" but it's far from it","the tree used to hide the squirrels in is much smaller than expected, about 14"" tall, and has a small string on top I assume you are supposed to hang it buy. Our dogs see it just as much as a toy to chew on and run around the house with than anything else. It is too flimsy to stand on its own in order for the dogs to get the toys from. I am glad I got this on the gold box deal because I am disappointed in it overall"
5,Fav toy ever!!,"This is our 2 month doggy's fav toy ever!!!! She loves it and has a ball with the lil squeeks !The only thing i would suggest is that you pull the ""whiskers"" out as they came out easily and I did not like that at all."
5,My Wheaten Terrier loves this toy,"My wife and I have a six year old Wheaten terrier. He is an extremely playful dog, very high energy and has grown out of the puppy phase of totally destroying his toys.He absolutely LOVES this toy and will bring it to me on the sofa when he wants me to 'reload' his squirrels so that he can pull them out again. He will also drag the toy over to where he is laying on the floor so that he knows it is close by.If he was younger he might destroy this toy, but in two weeks or so of ownership the most he has done is nipped off one of the squirrels ears. Since replacement squirrels are available it's not much of a concern if he should lose or rip one up... you could really use any small stuffed toy, but the replacement squirrels are cheap and of course this toy comes with six, which is a lot for the price.This toy is worth every penny and absolutely our dogs favorite. The designers of this thing know exactly what to do to build a toy that entertains a dog."
5,Best toy yet!!,"Our corgi is crazy for all the squirrels, never seen her so focused on a toy! It also shipped super fast and is a great looking toy!"
1,Not worth the money,"I just recieved this toy and gave it to my 4 pound Miki puppy to play with. What a disappointment... This toy is a piece of junk. My pup literally played with it for one day and the squirrels starting coming apart.Don't bother buying this toy, it is not made well enough as a dog toy.Amazon, I am very disappointed that you would even consider selling this garbage."
5,Dog loves it!,My dog has a fascination with watching squirrels outside. When I bought this for her she didn't quite understand it but after hiding treats into the trunk it became a fun game for her! This is a great toy for any dog!
4,Even the large is small,"Even though I got a large, it was still quite small. My dog is 40lb and this was just about the right size. She couldn't grapse the educational aspect, but enjoyed chewing though the tree trunk!"
4,"There's Three, but the Stump is History","Even though my 13-lb Papillon/mix destroyed the trunk within one week, she still loves her chipmunks which keeps her busy at the ripe age of 10. I also provided shelter for a 2yr/80lb German Shepherd/mix for six months and the chipmunks withheld the beating. This is a wonderful toy for all sizes and ages. I rated it a four due to the trunk. Safe to say, the chipmunks are still intact."
3,Annie loves it,"She will pull the squirrels out...but not put them back in. :) She has already eaten one of the ears off, and stuffing was all over the carpet...so he is in the ""hospital"" waiting to have surgery. She seems to play with the trunk more than the critters. It is a cute toy though. Go figure."
4,Great toy!,My dogs liked the sqeaky squirells but didn't really get into the little squirrel cave came. They lost interest pretty quickly.
3,all squeaked out,My dogs loved this toy for an evening. They had fun with the small squeaking squirrels. By the next morning the squirrels' squeakers had all been removed. So this is a great toy but doesn't last very long.
1,Should have read the reviews first. Squirrels lasted about a week!,"My Hairless Chinese Crested LOVED this toy! He figured out how to get the squirrels out and loved the challenge. He is not a destructive dog, just obsessive about his toys.One by one the squeakers stopped squeaking within a week. They simply collapsed and stopped making any noise.It is a great concept, just poor quality. I could have bought 3 toys from Walmart that would lasted longer.Lesson learned."
3,Not for a chewer,"If you have a chewer, the house will be destroyed rendering this game ineffective. Our german shepherd/doberman mix loves the different parts of this toy, but had the squirrels out in seconds, and within a week she had chewed the section between the top and the first hole so it no longer holds the squirrels. Essentially this became 4 soft chew toys in one. On the plus side, she loves to carry the squirrels around and the ""amputation"" of the squirrels ears and legs has provided her with much amusement."
4,I like this toy more than the dog.,"I think this toy is so cute! The animals inside are definitely chipmunks though, not squirrels. Unfortunately my dog is too dumb to enjoy this toy. I tried to introduce it to her the way that the packaging suggests but she still doesn't realize that the animals are inside. She will play with the chipmunks on their own if I remove them or she will carry around the large stump with all of the chipmunks inside. She also has never been interested in her Kong toy either so if you're dog isn't on the smarter end of the spectrum this toy may not be for them. Also, my dog is ~30 pounds and these chipmunks are a little small for her. They are smaller than what I would call the ""average"" dog toy size."
3,Didn't Survive,Dog tore squirrels apart in a short time period. At first it was fun but he grew bored with it.
1,Dog destroyed it in under 10 miniutes,Definitely not for larger breeds even if they're puppies. She tore though it after 10 minutes and it is ruined ans useless.
3,Very Small,"This toy was quite a bit smaller than I thought it would be. My pug could swallow these squirrels whole. He loved the toy, but he had to be supervised with it and within the first week he has pulled the stuffing out of the squirrel. Wish it was bigger and sturdier."
1,"Terrier loved it, but it didn't even last 1 day","My Cairn Terrier absolutely loved this toy and it took him only a few seconds to become an expert at getting the squirrels out of the trunk. He walked around for hours with one of the squirrels in his mouth, then finally sat down and proceeded to tear it up and eat the stuffing. It made him terribly sick and was a real mess to clean up. Much to his dismay, I had to take this toy away from him for his own good. I do not recommend this toy, at least not for this breed of dog."
4,Small,I bought the smallest one for my minuature schnauzer and her mouth doesn't fit inside the holes of the tree. She still loves the little squirles but even if you have a small dog maybe its better to go with the medium size.
2,Cute and fun but not very durable :o(,"I have two mini daschunds who love toys...especially squeaky toys. Since daschunds are bred for badger hunting, I just knew they would love seeking the squirrels inside this ""log"". They were absolutely thrilled and couldn't leave it alone for about 45 minutes. However, the squirrels were relieved of their squeakers and ripped to shreds in short order. I continued to ""hide"" the squirrels inside the log and then throw it for them to dig them out again, but because the squirrels guts and squeakers were gone, so was the challenge. Great idea for an interactive dog toy, it just didn't hold up well to my two little guys. :o("
5,My Greyhound LOVES this toy!,"Pixie loves these squirrels and played with this toy until she literally tore the plastic bottom out of the trunk. Mind you, it took her more than 6 months to get this task completed, so the toy definitely stood up to her constant harassment valiantly! She still plays with the squirrels, though two of the three eventually lost their squeak. I'm actually pretty impressed with that, because Pixie's main goal in life is to KILL THE SQUEAK! With most soft toys, she simply rips at the seams until she can get the squeaker out - these little squirrels are too small for her to manipulate in that way, so they survived much longer! I hadn't seen this toy in the store in a long time, so I thought it was discontinued, SO glad to see it here - I'm buying her a new one!"
4,Great product,i have a dog who loves pit bull who loves plush toys rather than big bones so this was a perfect christmas present. He enjoys the squeaky noise the squirrels make as well.
3,"Great concept, but didn't last long.","I bought this for my lab puppy that was 5 months at the time. She loved that the squirels squeaked and she learned the concept fast, but the stitches on the squirrels' heads were loose and falling off just after 20 minutes. She wasn't excessive chewing on them -- especially being that I watched her like an eagle (I had paid nearly 20 after shipping). Ohh well, she loved it while they lasted. We still have the squirrels, and may one day, sew them back together."
5,The fun never ends!,"I recently picked this up for my two dogs. Both of them have fallen in love with it instantly. One of my dogs is always a bit quicker at puzzle toys than the other, but they both figured out how to get the squirrels out of the tree quickly. I love watching them work to get the toys out. So far they they haven't tired of taking the squirrels out, no matter how many times I snatch them up and put them back inside the tree. The little squirrels are really cute and seem relatively durable for how small they are, but I do watch the dogs carefully when they play with the toy because if not supervised, I do fear they could be chewed up easily. One of the other reviewers said you can buy replacement squirrels, so I might look into that and pick some up. Overall, this is a great toy at a great price. The pups and I both love it!"
2,Destroyed on the first day,"My minuature poodle loved the toy. To be fair, it arrived very quickly and my dog loved it immediately. However, the squirrels fell apart within hours, and he removed and chewed up the plastic squeakers. Very disappointed!"
4,"Fun, but not tough","I have 2 dogs, a basset hound and a mutt. This item is really cute, the dogs absolutely LOVE it. It only took them about 5 minutes to figure out how the toy works,they love carrying the little squirrels around. But as with most stuffed animal toys, they have started to work away at the squirrels and the trunks stuffing.So while it is fun and entertaining, I have to keep an eye on them when they are playing with it so they don't chow down on the squeakers inside the squirrels!"
4,"Fun dog toy, keeps them entertained","This has been fun for my 18 month old Shar Pei, she LOVES stuffies and has quite a few. She mostly just carried this around the first few days, but she has started figuring out how to get at least one or two squirrels out. I wouldn't say it is THAT much greater than just a regular stuffie toy, but she does like it all the same and it sure is cute."
2,Are they intentionally so easy to break ?,"I mean most dog toys do break sooner or later, but these break so fast with my small dog that it's pathetic. I mean I know the company wants us to buy replacement squirrels, but they just got too greedy here by making the life of the product so short. So I am replacing those squirrel with Kong brand toys, they know how to make tough toys and they will get my business. I give an extra star just because the trunk is pretty tough (showing that the company could but did not make the squirrels tough too)."
5,Dog loves it,My dog loves looking and pulling out all the squirrels. Keeps her busy for a while. I've also bought the bee's and looking to buy the birds.
3,Two squirrels torn up,"Bought this due to the great reviews on the site. Once I took it out of the box, my dog loved it instantly. However, when I left him alone with for 5 or 10 minutes, I noticed that two of the squirrels were torn. Too bad. It is going back."
5,Perfect for playful Aussie,My puppy loves this and carries the little squirrels around with him! Keeps him entertained for awhile. If your dog is a chewer it won't last long. Recommend buying replacement squirrels and stuff all of them in the tree for a challenge.
5,Exactly as expected,Very cute. Not sure the dogs won't destry it in a couple of days but neat idea for a gift
3,Squirrels,"My dog destroyed the squirrels almost instantly. However, the burrow that they come in is very sturdy. This would be nicer if the squirrels weren't so flimsy."
2,Cute idea but....,"My dogs had this entire toy ripped apart in a couple hours. The dogs ""killed"" all the squirrels and even the tree trunk. I had to throw it all away before someone swallowed a ""dead"" squirrel."
5,Adorable Toy!,"My Shih Tzu/Maltese mix loves this toy. She got out all the squirrels, played with them, then played with the house part without the squirrels...lol. I got her the small one which is perfect for her. Highly recommend if your dog likes soft, squeaky toys."
3,Squirrels (or chipmunks) have lasted but . . .,"Gus, my 10 month old, 13 pound Havanese, had great fun with the toy initially. Within 2 days he bored of the ""tree house"" and just played with the chipmunks. On the third day, he started playing with tree house again, but just to get to the cardboard sewn it to it.Two weeks later the destroyed tree house is a landfill somewhere but the 3 chipmunks are still going strong and squeaking well.Two stars for the chipmunks.Steve & Gus.EDIT 1/12/2010: I've added a third star. The 3 Chipmunk/Squirrels have remained a favorite toy of Gus's and he plays with them daily."
2,It's okay - not worth the money.,I have a jack russell puppy and he pulled the squirrels out within a minute of me handing him the toy. He does play with the little squirrels and he loves to shake the tree stump. But it wasn't stimulating for him at all.
2,Loved it until seams split open,"I bought the large size so my 4 month old pug puppy and my 8 year old retriever mix could both play with it. They did both enjoy it. Unfortunately the pug puppy is a chewer and in less than a week all 3 'squirrels' had multiple open seams. Squirrel 1 had open seams the day after it arrived. Squirrel 2 had the same problem 3 days after it arrived. The final squirrel lasted a week. The description said ""Durable enough to withstand tough play"". Nope. I've had puppies that were much harder on toys than this pug too. Part of the problem seems to be a quality control issue as no other toy we've had has had seams open like this.The 'log' part is great for putting other toys in though - and they enjoy chasing the empty 'log' around. Its pretty funny to see a puppy carrying this thing around when its half her size.So - if I were rating the FUN, it would be 5 stars. For a few days. Durability? 1 star."
2,great fun until somebody swallows a tail,"Our Goldendoodles (8 months and 5 months) absolutely loved this toy. The squirrels are ideal for self play, easy to sling around in the air, toss, juggle, throw, fetch, hide; and they loved digging the squirrels out of tree trunk as well -- this kept them occupied and never bored. Problem: the squirrels are not durable... within one day of getting our 5-month-old (a chewer, but not an extreme chewer -- he doesn't even have all his adult teeth yet!), he easily ripped off the tail of one of the squirrels and swallowed it whole... now we are very worried that he is going to have to have surgery to remove it from his digestive system. Hopefully it will pass through (gross). We are never letting them play with these squirrels again because they aren't safe. Maybe we should have purchased the larger one or maybe Kyjen should make the squirrels more durable to cater to larger breeds with stronger mouths."
1,Not Durable At All!,"I bought this based on the reviewers who claim their dogs cannot destroy this toy. My yellow lab took about 2 minutes to rip the holes in the tree wide enough for the squirrels to fall right out. It's obvious just looking at the material that it is not built to take much abuse as it's the same cheap cloth and stitching found on the majority of dog toys out there. This might be good for a dog who does not usually tear up toys, but for a typical dog like mine this toy is worthless - a complete waste of money!"
3,TRICKED AGAIN,"I purchased the Kyjen - Hide-A-Squirrel Pet Toy (Jumbo) for my 14 month old boxer. It arrived on 10/3/2011. I paid $14.02, for this item. My dog's very first interaction with this (So Call) well built toy, was disappointing for me. Also I felt ""TRICKED AGAIN"" ripped off. The house where the squirrels are put in, ripped when my dog put his stount in to get the squirrels out. Because my dog appears to really like this toy, I sewed the material back together. This is very disturbing. The TOYS are made for pets. Why not make these doys do what your advertising says it will do, or don't charge so much for them. $14.02 for a toy that couldn't with stand the first interaction? PLEASE..."
2,Play time,"Hide a Squirrel is a fun interactive toy, however, interactive is the key word. My dog likes the game but she likes one of us to play with her. Not a toy to keep her happy in our absence. Once I put a few treats in, that is all she wanted to look for & had no interest in pulling out the squirrels."
2,Fun for the 5 minutes it took him to tear it apart,"Our cattle dog/corgi mix loved it. To death.Unfortunately, that only took 5 minutes. He does still play with the squirrels if I throw them, but he's just as happy with a tennis ball. I wouldn't recommend this for any dog that likes to chew or pull on his or her toys."
2,Not that durable,"The ""tree"" has a plastic disk in the bottom, between 2 layers of fabric. My westie became obsessed with chewing the plastic and eventually chewed right through the fabric and would have eaten pieces of the plastic had I not taken it away. I ended up ripping out the inner layer of fabric and the trunk has been ok since. The squirrels are not that durable. One's squeaker was silenced while my dog was trying to get it out of the tree. Two of the squirrels are starting to come apart already and will need some mending. All that being said, it's pretty cute to watch her with the tiny squirrels. So, provided you don't mind making a few modifications if needed and making minor repairs to the squirrels this is a pretty good toy."
3,Hide a squirrel,This toy is cute and my dog loved it. Product is said to be durable and only lasted 1 week. My dog tore through the tree trunk in a few days and the entire toy was shredded within a week.
3,Not As Entertaining As Hoped,"My sister's 4 month old puppy figured it out within the first couple of minutes. The dog should've been named Einstein. She's aced every puzzle toy she's gotten so far. She also tore apart one of the squirrels within the first week. The other two survive. Rosie the Dog loves her toys. Even though she's a Labrador Pit Bull mix the Lab side must not be dominant. Rosie didn't get the concept of ""fetch"". BUT she will fetch and play if one of her squirrels is tossed. THAT she'll retreive and bring back to play again. Balls, frisbies, not so much. Go figure!"
3,Our dog is too smart for this toy,"I handed it to her and she immediately pulled the squirrels out and looked at me like, ""what next?"" She destroyed all the squeakers easily in the squirrels and has completely ignored the ""tree."" Not the end of the world, but it didn't last as long (or entertain her) as I was hoping"
2,Great until shredded,My Corgi and I enjoyed this for about three weeks until first the log got shredded and then one by one the squirrels were eviscerated. I'm still finding fluffs of the stuffing under furniture weeks later.
4,Adorable toy keeps my dog's attention.,"My dog loves her Ginormous Hide-A-Squirrel toy. It occupies her longer than most toys do because she keeps playing until she gets all of the ""squirrels"" out of the ""tree trunk."" Then she picks one squirrel out of the bunch to continue playing with. This is a great toy to stimulate a dog's problem-solving skills, especially if she must be left alone for a while. Do you suppose I can train her to put them all back inside the plush trunk? Maybe not. She still doesn't return her toys to her toybox!"
2,dog doesn't like,"my corgi doesn't like this toy, very much. I got her to play with it once or twice, she got bored with it because she got one squirrel out and wouldn't even they to get the other ones, she left it alone and went and got another toy to play with, so i made a mistake buying this toy"
5,Excellent art book for all Christians,"This is a thick soft cover art book that accompanies Biblical passages with art objects - paintings, sculptures from all cultures, Italian Renaissance to Modern Chinese water-colour that attempts to IMAGE the WORD - the gospel, and puts the love of Jesus in Christianity into a non-preachy, very emotionally and aesthetically moving document that appeals to the modern, intellectual, sophisticated, sensitive, cultured but atheist reader. It makes the Bible come alive in a fantasy of visual ecstasy. A marvellous gift for those who are hurting from a lack of understanding God's love. A spiritually soothing gift in a coffee-table book format."
3,Good book with lots of interesting ideas,An interesting read with many ideas thrown out there to consider. Worth a look if you are open minded and curious.
1,The title of this book is misleading!,"This book came up when I searched for ""aquatic exercise"". Since there was no synopsis, I took a chance. Boy, was I surprised! This book is better classified as alternative medicine and includes such useful topics as enemas, compresses, steam baths, foot soaks, etc. Definately not what I was expecting!"
3,Not very happy,"In the advertisement, it says this is a Seiko Men' s Automatic Diver Watch, but, it is a Kinetic watch. Moreover, it was not made in Japan, but Malaysia. All of the Seiko watches that I have had worn before were made in Japan. All Seiko watches were made in Japan, that is why I bought Seiko watches. I am very disappointed."
4,Very Tough & Gets Lot Of Remarks,"I purchased this watch from Amazon 3 years ago. I was in the Army at that time and needed a watch that would hold up to desert conditions. It stood the environment well. It is still functioning well.You should know that this watch requires you to wear it so it keeps time. I sometimes don't feel like wearing a watch, and it if sits more than a day you will have to reset the time, day of month and day of week which takes maybe 15 seconds.Also, the rubber band is quite tough and heavy. In the summer, any sweat may cause minor irritation.This watch is quite heavy, but I have been impressed with its toughness.You will probably get at least one compliment a day when wearing it too.Highly recommended."
5,7 years old and like brand new,"I bought my Seiko in July 2003 and I haven't had one issue with it. The bands last me 2-3 years depending on how much I'm in salt water. I have dove with it several times, but only to a depth of 50ft. It definately is fast by about 5 minutes every two weeks for me. Just put on a new band that I purchased through Amazon, cleaned up the watch and it looks brand new. Crystal is very tough and I would say this watch is extremely durable. It also gets alot of comments, mostly from other dive watch fans. I also have a Citizen 200M non-automatic that keeps better time, but seems less durable as I have had to have it serviced twice in ten years. I would recommend this watch without reservation."
3,Manage your expectations,"It's a very good looking watch and is fine for swimming and diving. Visibility under water is very good. However, my experience over the past month has been that you need to wear it at least every other day or it will stop running. In addition, the casing is very thick (I guess not for a diving watch) and it doesn't fit comfortably under standard shirt sleeves and jackets. As a result I use it mainly for recreation, I don't use it for work."
1,Jewelry not a watch,"I love the look of the watch and it does catch attention.I work in an office, but get around and do someminimal physical work also.Nonetheless, my watch is typically losingapprox 5 min/day.In addition, it periodically stops (especiallywhen I take it off for the night). It shouldnot need to be worn 24/7.I've had other selfwinding (automatic) watches in thepast and never had this trouble.I will be trying to find out how to have it serviced.At the moment, a watch you can not trust is simply apiece of jewelry.- The stopping problem became worse and worse....I have now sent this watch back to Seiko and am awaiting theirresponse-------------I sent the watch back to Seiko, they fixed it and UPS lost it....Seiko sent me a new watch....The new one seems to be fine..... it is keeping time and I am now happy.Thanks Guys!"
1,Disgusted,"I am so disgusted. I have ordered this watch twice and both times it did not work... then I don't even get the full refund. That's it, I'm done with this."
1,Watch didnt work-- waiting for refund,the watch came to me and the second hand keep getting stuck at the 12:00 hr.I sent it back on 9/16/07 and still do not have a refund. I expect a full refund including what it cost me to return it. What is taking so long? I want an answer!!!
2,made in Mayaysia?,"When you buy a Seiko, make sure it's made in Japan. Those are the good ones. I don't trust the ones made in Malaysia. Okay? okay.."
3,"Great looks, but practical?","I thought this watch was awesome! I wore it for several days in a row and it worked great. Then, I didn't wear it for one day, and it stopped running, so I had to wind-it and reset the date/time.If you have a few watches that you like to switch between, like I do, this watch probably isn't for you. It must be worn EVERYDAY in order to work consistently. Even just deciding not to wear it for one day will make it stop working, then require resetting. To me this was a big nuisance, and I didn't realize this before I bought it. Wish Seiko made it with a battery, solar-power, or kinetic battery, then this watch would be perfect."
2,Great Watch...But Defective as Delivered,"I have owned many Seiko Diver's models over the years, and I think I know a thing or two about them. This SKXA35 was delivered quite defective - it runs incredibly fast, about 3 hours per day fast! Something is definitely broken in it, probably in the balance assembly. Seiko's with the 7S26 movement should not exceed + or - 45 seconds per day (this is straight from Seiko). So I am in the process of an exchange. I hope Amazon comes through, because the quality of the watch initially was very impressive, and I loved the yellow dial."
4,Great AUTOMATIC drive watch,"This is a great knock-around watch as well as a great dive watch. If you're thinking of buying one be awhere that it is an automatic watch, once called autowind watch. This watch doesn't use a battery and is wound by the movement of your arm. If you set it down for a couple of days, it will stop. I guess we're all too use to quartz battery watches to remember the old days of winding watches."
4,Great watch for the price!,"I can't think of anyone who makes a more robust automatic watch for the money. I have had a half dozen Seiko divers and they have all been exceptionally reliable & durable. Accuracy is on par with a mechanical/automatic watch in this price point. +/- 15 seconds per day is pretty normal. If you want/need better accuracy, I would advise you to buy this watch (or a similar Seiko diver) in the quartz version.The yellow dial is very sharp! Really gives it a pop of color and looks great with the black rubber strap.The hardlex crystal will scratch (although less easily than mineral crystal and a LOT less easily than acrylic).....if it had a Sapphire crystal, I would have given it 5 stars. But then again, the price would probably be $50-100 more."
5,Great Deal!,"Finally got one of these, saw them a few years ago and wanted it but they were going for over $300 at the local malls, etc. Had been checking for something else and found this on Amazon and could not order it fast enough, great watch, durable band, maybe a little stiff yet as it's still new. After getting it I googled it and could not find it for a lesser price anywhere, in fact typically quite a bit more elsewhere. It was brand new in a nice, nice box! Last divers watch was a Casio which was about the same price and the band broke in less than one year! It was one of those GShock, the cost of the band replacement is what drove this purchase!"
2,Seiko Diver takes a dive after 1year,"This is a nice looking, well working watch for the price....but....after a year of service both the bezel and the screw down crown went south. The cost estimate to repair by Seiko (no local jeweler in Princeton NJ will touch it)is half the original cost. Now Im left to decide if I should spend the money to repair mine or just dump it and buy another. My prior Seiko diver ran 10 years without a problem which is why I purchased this one. I guess some things never change and some do."
2,quality not up to scratch,Warning this is not a seiko made in japan. The time piece was made in Malaysia and the strap in China and I dont think the quality control has traveled well. I bought this watch in summer 2008 and within a month it stopped working. Pretty good service- watch was repaired as back to me within 3 weeks. Just found out its now going seriously fast ( 6 minutes fast per hour).Strangely the warranty is 3 years in the states but only 1 year elsewhere. Now there is faith in your product!
5,MUST HAVE!!!,"I thoroughly enjoy Curtis' music, which prompted me a while back to see if he had any CDs. I purchased ""Sacred Revolution"" and have taken a lot from this wonderful album! Every song speaks to you in a different way about the powerful and awesome love of God. If you want music that makes you think honestly about your faith and strengthens your love for Christ, this is a must have! I played it for my mother who ended up buying 5 albums to give her friends as gifts!I would also highly recommend purchasing ""Through The Storm""."
2,I've read better-,"This is my second Sasha Lord book- The first was ""In A Wild Wood""-which I really enjoyed once I got past the whole rape thing. I gave this book 2 stars because, although it's taken me a long time to finish, I feel the NEED to finish it,wanting to know how it ends- BUT--I couldn't get past the ""ick factor"" in the fact Istabelle thought Ruark was her cousin and still made love to him and how Ruark left her with her most hated enemy for over a month to be beaten and for all he knew worse, any true hero would have save her right away no matter what. But all in all I will read more of her books."
2,Waste of time,"I read this book because i had read ""In a Wild Wood"" by the same author. I did not find this book interesting on any level. I used to read romances although i am not in any way a romantic. I just read the ones i think will be amusing. I expected far better from this author. It was just..boring. There was no chemistry between the characters, it was not funny, and i just could not find any real reason to like the hero or heroine. Ive read many entertaining romances. Ive even read some that actually displayed real human sentiment. This one offered nothing."
3,Beyond the Wild Wind,"Though she is brave and daring, a lady Robin Hood/Captain Blood, Istabelle O'Bannon does need help from a man, and so she turns to the only one she trusts, her cousin Mangan. However, she has not seen the man in years, and so when he is unable to come and sends another man, Ruark Haagen, she assumes Ruark is Mangan and never gives him a chance to explain. So, although Ruark finds that he is powerfully attracted to the lady, since she is his ""cousin"", she's off limits; and although Mangen is really the only man who can help Istabelle, Ruark does his best to help in any case.*** Vivid imagery and sweeping scenes will carry a historical romance fan back to another time and place. Although much of the action is built on the strength of miscommunications, the powerful prose compensates for the slightly weak premise. ***Amanda Killgore"
2,"Good bones, no meat!","I watched this dvd knowing nothing of its background. I didn't know it had been a popular book and I knew nothing of the story line. The whole time I was watching the movie, I found myself wanting to see more of the culture of Savannah and wanted to 'feel' more of that Southern Charm. There was some, but not enough. There are a couple of stand-out characters, one of them being 'the man with the flies'. I also felt as if this movie was trying to preach the acceptance of the homosexual lifestyle. I don't like movies that try to 'preach' anything! And frankly, I think Kevin Spacey was too good for this role. There weren't enough 'meaty' scenes to merit casting an actor of his calibur in the role. I was left with an empty, incomplete feeling when this movie was over. In a way, the story line was left hanging. This is one of those movies that makes me want to shout ""DO OVER! DO OVER!"""
2,Love the movie - disapointed with the product I was sent.,"Midnight in the Garden of Good & Evil [VHS]Recieved my movie in just a short time - matter of days actually - which was fantastic. However, upon receiving it I immediatly saw on the cover that it was a ""Special viewing copy - NOT TO BE SOLD OR RENTED"" I was a tad irritated. Then when I viewed the movie and the same disclaimer about the movie was repeatedly splashed accross the screen I was ticked off!!Not happy and pretty surprised that someone would sell that on Amazon, ship it out to a customer not mentioning a bit of it in the discription - and expect someone to be happy with it.Bad business and bad ethics for a company in my opinion...Sent an email to them and waiting to hear back - hoping they will correct the problem."
2,Bad Adaptation of a Wonderful Novel,"Hated it. The loveable John Cusak is completely wasted. Kevin Spacey is o.k. What is Clint's daughter doing as an imagined love interest, and why have her sing. Uggghhhh. What a missed opportunity. Save your $11."
4,The eternal thirst of ambition,"Savannah, Georgia. This will be the beautiful stage in which a tense drama will take place, when a very wealthy man appears like the principal responsible for the death of his nephew.The opulence, the double moral and the multiple arms the power has to deal with, are superbly told and ravishingly photographed in this formidable thriller of Clint Eastwood.Kevin Spacey is particularly effective as the ruthless millionaire, John Cussack is perfect like the irreverent photographer and we have to remark the excellent edition, the superb illumination and the splendid artistic direction that reminded to one of the unsaid influences of Mr. Eastwood: Luchino Visconti."
3,"Not bad, but the book is much better!","This is a very good movie, but the book ""Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil"" is so much better. Based on a true story, the film is set in Savannah, Georgia, as a murder mystery unravels and plays out among the city's colorful residents. This film boasts a wonderful cast, especially the Lady Chablis, who portrays herself. However, I just thought that so many of the details from the book were lost in the movie version, especially the characteristics of Savannah's various personalities. Clint Eastwood directed this film, which is surprising because it truly is one of his worst, which is saying a lot because the film is decent. However, Clint probably shouldn't have wasted so much time on his talentless daughter, Allison Eastwood, who didn't do much in the way of acting besides this film...and it's easy to see why! My advice is to read the incredible book first, and then follow up with the film if you so desire."
3,Kevin Spacy's best performance,"I vacationed in Savannah this past June. All the guides talk about is the book and this movie. With all the history in that part of the country, I think they are missing the mark. I had seen this movie when it was first released. I recently bought it, hoping to see more of Savannah. I ws disappointed in that respect, but it held my interest. Spacy was perfect in the role of the wealthy guy who lived in that beautiful house. Mercer House. True Crime is always facinating. Joy Wood"
4,"Not great, but good","I saw the movie when it came out in the mid 90's and after visiting Savannah this past summer & touring the Mercer house and then reading the book for the fist time, I just had to see it again. I remembered it as being better than I now rate it, but I also read the book before seeing it the second time & I found several things lacking or rushed when comparing it to the book. It is still a must see if you liked the book, but remember that a movie always cuts & changes some things that you just can't figure out why, like why is the young man's name Billy in the movie & Danny in the book ?"
4,Great movie!,"This movie is great. It is entertaining, exciting, and full of ""suspense"" in that it keeps you guessing. At the same time, it has a few ""holes"" in it whereas it remains unclear the exact purpose of some of the characters, the ""squirrel lady"" in particular. I am hoping that the book lends more insight into this significant character. It does encourage me to read the book. I feel that the movie slights her real interaction with the overall plot. For that reason, I give this movie a four-star rating instead of a five. Meanwhile, don't be discouraged. The movie is quite enjoyable, and remains one of my favorites."
2,I liked this movie...,"...back when it was called ""The Great Gatsby!"" This movie (and book) is a thinly-veiled rip-off of The Great Gatsby."
1,Boring !,I was disappointed in viewing this movie after reading the book. The book was captivating and thrilling while the screen version was anything but that. Perhaps what they say is true the book is always better than the movie!
2,Only So-So...Too Long...Tepid...But the Lady Chablis Rocks !,"I bought the DVD of this so-so film so I could watch the scenes with The Lady Chablis repeatedly. ""She"" is a riot...sassy and silly and ultimately the only redeeming feature of Clint Eastwood's disappointing version of the mega-selling book. Though John Cusack is charming in ""Grosse Pointe Blank"" and ""High Fidelity,"" he exudes no personality here and even looks pasty and exhausted. Kevin Spacey's Jim Williams is under- developed and creates neither sympathy nor loathing. The atmosphere of Savannah and the vodoo element are also wasted. This unfortunate combination allows Chablis to walk off with the picture... and she manages to make Cusack, Spacey, and the rest of the cast the straight (no pun intended) pawns in her hilarious act."
3,Decent movie...read the book,"This movie has an excellent cast--too bad it moves at a snail's pace. Also, they tried to make it into every possible type of genre; murder mystery, drama, comedy, documentary, romance, etc. It is still worth watching, though. Just keep your expectations low, and things will work out fine."
3,Not what I hoped it'd be,"I was hoping that this movie would show all the beauty that John Berendt described in the book that the movie was based on. This movie doesn't show everything that was in the book, nor does it show everyone. If you're hoping this movie is going to illustrate the book, then this isn't what you're looking for. The movie itself was OK. It was interesting and I didn't find myself getting bored while watching it. It seemed a bit rushed though - there wasn't enough detail. I think that too much of it was about the case rather than the characters. Unlike the book, I never really got close to the characters - they didn't really seem to have any depth."
2,Garden of Good and Evil Produces Weeds,"Clint Eastwood should have been the last person to direct ""Midnight In The Garden of Good and Evil"". He completely misses the issues of homophobia, racism and ridiculous elitism of the book's true story. The film falls flat and so does Eastwood's attempt at any humor as well. The drag queen, who brought the book to life and gave us some relief from the overall darkness of the book, is almost non-existent. The issues 'she' seriously brought forth in the book about racism and homophobia are never brought to the screen. Some of the quirky characters who also gave the book distinction are omitted too so what we have is a story about southern decadence, charm and most of all a southern city--Savannah, Georgia--that was a character of itself--cut to the quick and edited to the point of boredom. The only thing growing is this graden is weeds."
3,hummmmmm,"Well, this is definately a different movie! Kevin Spacey is one of the best actors of all time, that's the best thing about this movie, even though this is not one of his best performances. I thought it was kind of boring, for the fact that it is a very long movie, but yet there is nothing to it. The story is just Kevin shooting someone, then going to trial for murder, with a bunch of nothing in between. So if you like Kevin Spacey you should see this, and if not, you still may like it anyway."
2,Men are all a little gay,"With all the inbreeding down south I suppose explains a lot about the plot of this movie or why they lost the war. I thought it was ok buy I liked the book better. Even Clint Eastwood has to direct at least one stinker. I did enjoy the female impersonator ""Chablis"", he was terrific. In all fairness though this was hard material to make a movie of, and it shows."
1,An even bigger disappointment than I expected.,"Despite the amazing acting and directing talent associated with this film, it was undoubtedly the biggest disappointment of the last year. Eastwood's straightforward style did little to capture the elegance and romance of one of America's most scenic and historical cities. While adapting this novel for the big screen was not an easy task, I still expected a much more engaging plot. Cusak, as always, did a better than fair job, adding some quirky humor in surprising places, but Spacey seemed to sleep walk his way through. I was truly relieved when the movie was finally over. In a nutshell, the confusing plot dragged on painfully, and I would not recommend this film to anyone. Even the biggest Eastwood, Cusak or Spacey fan is going to find just about any of their other films a better bet-they are an incredibly talented ensemble, but they didn't hit the mark here."
1,You messed up,"I received an empty carton with no movies disc included. It was so complicated to try and get satisfaction from you that I just ate the charge and got the movie ""Midnight in The Garden of Good and Evil"" from someone else."
1,B-O-R-I-N-G,"This movie ranks up there with Dick Tracy (Warren Beatty, Madonna) as ""Most Boring Movie"". There are some nice scenes of the city of Savannah and its people but that doesn't make up for the movie's boring and seemingly unending plot. Very disappointed"
1,An underwhelming movie,"What a shame to turn such a well constructed story into a very poor movie. All of the nuances and interesting details of the city, the characters and the murder have been lost in this movie. If you are interested in the story, read the book and don't bother with the movie."
3,Good Movie,"I rented this movie because I recently visited Savannah and the tour guide recommended it. I enjoyed the movie, but it's not in my top ten of favorites."
3,Not too impressed,I think I may have liked this movie if I did not read the book. The book was just so good and this movie was just okay. I do not like how they changed the movie so far from the book. To me a movie based on a book needs to follow at least the same time-line as the book. They changed the way some major events happened. I did not like that. But if I would not have read the book I'm sure I would have found this movie very enjoyable.
4,A must read if you are traveling to Savannah,"I stopped in Savannah with no knowledge of the book or movie and therefore didn't ""GET"" Savannah according to one local. The ""BOOK"" is apparently the key to unlocking the quirkiness of this beautiful southern town. There are tours dedicated to it. I am a fan of Cusak and Spacey so I read the book first then watched the movie. It did give me a better understanding of the town and it's people."
4,Next to excellent and definitely remarkable!,"Very good film - in top 1% of all Hollywood creations. The reason I am giving it 4 stars is an existance of Kieslowski, Antonioni, Tarkovski, etc. Most ""regular"" mass-productions are not worth a fraction of a positive grade. One thing bothers, though. How did mass culture manage to mess up Eastwood's life by making him dirtyharriish when he is actually capable of mastering real Art?!? Heil McDonald's!"
3,The book was much better,"This film just couldn't do the book justice. I read the book and loved it-- it depicted life in the South so vividly. In the book, the characters were complex, the story was well-written. Although the movie was good, you have to read the book to get the full effect. It's just impossible to fit all of that detail onto a movie screen. Worth watching, though."
4,Not Bad At All,"So many critics suggest that this film was not as good as the literature, but and gave this film a bad score. Also someof the viewer suggested that this film was too long, Well, I will love to view this film 10 times than watching Titanic even just once (I had actually wasted 3 hours and $4.5 in theater for that sinked ship. The greatest thing about this movie ia the acting. From kelso- Wilams- Chabli- Joe- Mendy to Minerva, the verbal and non- verbal expression showed the credits of this film. If you are a viewer who will like to watch the great actings, you can think about to get this video."
5,DVD review,our family was going to Savannah in 15 days when I ordered this DVD that was a murder mystery that happened in Savannah and Clint Eastwood filmed the movie there in the same house and town. I was very happy that it arrived in 7 days which gave me plenty of time to watch it before we went on our trip. I would definately order from this company again.
3,"Nobel attempt, but misses the mark","It's hard not to compare this screen adaptation to its wildly popular source material. For those who haven't read the book, the movie probably works better than for those who have. What's unfortunately missing from the movie is any real sense of pace and that crucial--and admittedly hard to capture--FEELING of southern decadence. It's not really enough to just show drag queens and men with flies on a leash--the truly great directors create the ATMOSPHERE that such eccentrics inhabit. That said, the additional material contains on the DVD is a real bonus."
5,A classic,One of the best classic films - I've watched it many times and still love it! the perfect southern murder thriller
4,midnight in the garden of good and evil,"Enjoyed this movie, especially the Savannah sceneryIt's one of those movies that you learn something neweverytime you watch it. Amazon is the bomb,great pricesand fabulous selection!"
2,A REAL DISAPPOINTMENT,"The book this movie was based on is such a good book! The movie, unfortunately is not even on the same level. I thought Kevin Spacey was wonderful as the eccentric, Jim Williams. However, the plot of the movie was patchy at best , leaving out details that made the story seem incomplete. Some of the details that were touched on in the movie, had no background information, so they did not make sense, if you had not read the book. I was very disappointed in the movie!"
3,Solid (but long) movie,"This is a good movie overall, however there are a couple of complaints. First would be the wandering plot---could've been tightened up more as well as shortened. Everyone I have talked to about the movie mentions how long it was.Second, Lady Chablis is overused...she is kinda gimmicky in my opinion and wears thin in a couple scenes. Her type of novel character is better used in small doses, not as the main focus.that is all go watch this joint and see what YOU think"
3,"Not as good as the book, but worth watching","This Clint Eastwood film shadows the book by John Berendt closely; the acting is superb and the cinematography impressive. Sounds pretty good, right? It is ""pretty good"", but not great, as many thought it would be.Overall, something is missing. The movie lags in places but then picks up the pace, only to become stale again minutes later. Personally I think the focus was too wide; the director tried to embrace the whole world of Savannah in one film---it doesn't really work.Kevin Spacey is excellent is this film."
5,Great movie,"This is a great movie that I'll revisit time and again. Great acting, great storyline. Also, it beautifully reflects life in Savannah, a place I've often visited, and it makes me want to return there a great deal. I suspect that the Savannah Visitors Bureau benefits greatly from it. PS: The dog, Uga, can, in fact, be seen daily taking its walk, What a place."
3,A Fun Romp but then again I live in Georgia,"A fun movie, not particularly well acted but it was great fun for me since I am from GA. There really are people here like that although not as much anymore. The South has been completely diluted by an influx of people from all over the world. Even as recently as the '80s it was entirely possible to see these type of characters here, but alas no more.I want to read the book. I have a feeling it will be much better and even a lot more fun than this cliff notes type movie of the Savannah culture. Lady Chiblis is very authentic and fun to watch although some of her dialog is just silly. John Cusack, while a complete yummy hunk, doesn't carry his role very well. Nice to look at though.LOVED SEEING UGA!"
3,medicore,"The ""Book"" started the whole fascination with Savannah, so it was obvious that a movie would be made. A lot of people slammed this film for various reasons, but truth be told it is not a bad movie. It just isn't up to par with the magic of Berendt's best-selling book, which is a real shame considering the level of talent present for the film. The movie suffers from a slow-moving plot, as well as an attempt to include every little facet of the book. The entertaining scenes are there, problem is they are few and far between. This film is worth watching nonetheless simply for the footage in Savannah and of Mercer House, but the book leaves this dvd squarely in the bargain bin."
4,I really enjoyed the movie!!!!,Personally I enjoyed the movie. I found it rather interesting and it caught my attention being that I am a Georgia native. I am about two hours from Savannah and was familiar with some of the happenings. I was truly amused with the Lady Chablis. I've watched this movie more than once and I purchased it through Amazon.Com. I enjoyed the movie though I thought that it needed a little work.
2,Book was better,"After visiting Savannah and reading the book, I was disappointed in the movie. I love Kevin Spacey, but he was flat in this movie."
3,Looked like it was from a library,"When you buy a used DVD, you expect it to have the standard packaging. This copy still had stickers and a cover from a library."
3,midnight,"It was OK, not nearly as good as the book and it some parts both the movie and the book were boring"
3,Subtitled,"Having recently returned from a trip to Savannah, we were excited to see this movie. Can't figure out why it's subtitled. It's annoying to watch."
3,Too long but ....,"an interesting way to learn some about Savannah, it is often mentioned in the tours. Our B&B also had a copy for us to watch."
4,FAIR REPRESENTATION OF BOOK,Bought the movie because we had read the book. It brough to life many of the characters and incidents written about and we would enjoy watching it again
4,excellent movie,"I loved this movie, even watched it twice right away to see if I missed anything and of course I did,I am a huge john cusack fan, so I was surpried at kevin spacy, he was great in this movieits a keeper.."
3,dramatic movie,"The movie is of medium interest, especially if you have read the book. Dont expect the movie to be as intricate & involved in character detail as the book is."
5,Southern Culture on the Skids!,"The beauty of Savannah is captured in this quirky tale of a wealthy gentlemen charged with the murder of his crass protege. The camera does justice to the elegance of the city, its buildings, homes, and park-like squares. Characters abound, in every sense of the word. Less would have been more in the case of Lady Chablis, Savanah's most famous female impersonator. However, Kevin Spacey was great as the central character of the movie, John Cusack was great as usual, and the rest of the cast was up to their lead. This is a film whose charm comes from its fine cinematography, interesting plot, and particularly the eccentricities of its subjects. Definitely different, and very entertaining."
3,SOUTHERN DISCOMFORT,"Clint Eastwood's direction usually brings out excellent performances from his cast and this one is no exception. John Cusack as writer John Kelso; Kevin Spacey as nouveau riche Jim Williams; Jack Thompson as the cunning lawyer Sunny, and The Lady Chablis as him/herself all grasp their roles eagerly and make the most of their screen time. Ms. Chablis does at times outstay her welcome, but the drag queen chews up the role with a marvelous energetic fury. Based on a true story, MIDNIGHT is a bit long in the tooth and the leisurely pace focuses more on the characters than any suspense or real mystery. This may be what Eastwood intended, and he certainly has captured the beautiful Southern glory of Savannah. But the story goes on too long and the voodoo inclusion seems forced and ultimately unnecessary. Irma Hall is marvelous as the voodoo priestess, but the movie left me wanting more or probably even less. A good but not great picture."
4,I enjoyed this movie,I bought the movie to watch because it is based on a true story and it involved the friend of a friend. It's a good one. I recommend the movie and the seller.
