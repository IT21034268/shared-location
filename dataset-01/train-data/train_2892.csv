1,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,"This game was horrible, I wasted my money on it and I recomend that you don't waste yours. I have never played such a bad game, there is no action and too much violence, this game is not appropriate for young kids under the age of 12 regardless what the label says."
1,Ugh.,"The item never arrived. Pure and simple. Please note that the one star rating is given BECAUSE it wasn't received. The game itself I am sure is fine, and in fact, years ago I played it, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. It was incompetent shipping that leads to the poor review."
2,I couldn't get very far into this one...,"Not being Wiccan myself, I perhaps would have found Ms. Lipp's writing to be more personally resonating if I followed her path.However, there was an essential problem to this book that prevented me from taking what she said to heart. Certainly she gives ""reasons"" for her arguments, such as mentioning that perhaps the Gods would be displeased with merely tealights as representations of the elements-- but is this really a reason? There are equally good arguments for any arrangement of symbols in ritual.Logical fallacies and narrow-minded assumptions aboud. This text was not for me."
1,a grave disappointment,"The most glaring concern in this book: the reference to aligning Wicca with idolatry bothered me greatly. As one of the reviewers referenced, the use of statuary in ritual and in our homes does not mean we worship them as the Gods...I cannot begin to fathom worshipping a statue. As representations, as reminders of the beauty of this world and our Gods, treasured focal points on our altars, yes, absolutely YES! Idol worship? Never.Save your money, Grey Cat's ""Deepening Witchcraft"" is much better than this and covers witchcraft in a deeper, more meaningful way, especially for those interested in leadership issues within witchcraft and the challenges our faith faces."
1,Danger Will Robinson Danger!!!,"We are presently using this book as an example of how not to teach ritual. This book is highly opinionated and you can easily see the influence of her ex-husband (a Druid) throughout the book. There are many books that are much better guides including Simms Circle of the Cosmic Muse, Harrows Book and Currott's, WitchCrafting. Each is more detailed and more enlightening than this ponderous tome. The regrettable thing is someone new to the Path may pick this book up and use it for a guide. Fortunately my co-teacher and I have the experience (each over 30 years) to see the fallacies in this book. Enter with skepticism and verify everything with other sources.SageOne"
1,Not worth the read,"It seems many people liked this book, but I found it way too long-winded and way too opinionated. While I am open to hearing of other ways of doing things, I prefer to do what works for me and felt that the author was forcing her opinions on the reader as if there was one and only one way to do stuff - hers!"
5,advanced Topics in Wiccan PRACTICE.,"I bought this book and Wicca 333: Advanced Topics in Wiccan Belief at the same time, and the two worked really well together. That one about the beliefs of Wiccans and why they hold them, this one about what Wiccans do. Beliefs vs Practice, Theology vs Theurgy, Thinking Vs Doing.As a practitioner with over 20 years experience myself, this book spoke to MY needs, although I wish it came out 10 years ago or so.Little of it was revelatory-I learned little new-but I now have a compendium I can pass out to people who want to learn more about what I do and why, a compendium better than ""what Witches do"" and WAY better than ""when someone you love is Wiccan"""
5,A delightful read,"With all of the Wicca 101 and spell books out there, it's nice to read a book that doesn't just cover the basics, actually explains the why's and doesn't resemble a cookbook.Deborah Lipp, in addition to publishing under a name that can be taken seriously, not only gives a more detailed description of the typical ritual formate, but gives the why?'s and explains the steps and how they relate to different aspects of a person's faith, the air, or intellectual, the water, or emotional, the earth, or practical, and the fire, or mystical. If you have a serious interest in Wicca or rituals, this book is for you. If you are looking to get revenge on your ex or make a certain cute member of the opposite sex fall in love with you, don't let this book slow you down on your quest."
3,Not my way but a good read,"I think its a very informative read but I felt like it was against what I love about paganism. It was too rigid and not personal enough to the person. Yes in every ritual there are certain things that one should do for protection sake or ritual sake but there were so many rules, I felt like I had lost my reasoning for my beliefs. But I think its good to see why and how and then mix it up with what you feel in your heart is YOUR right way."
3,A New Light In The Prog World,"A solid effort by an extremely promising new progressive rock band. The sound of Tr3nity, (cool band name) is a nice mix of late 70's Genesis, Fish era Marillion, Styx and Pink Floyd. It is very apparent that the band's influences are from the 1970's, however Tr3nity are not rehashing a dated 70's sound. The Cold Light of Darkness contains good production, solid songwriting, great musical performances, especially from the band's keyboard and guitar player and tells a good story lyrically. Tr3nity is not breaking any new ground, however I find this cd to be a nice addition to my progressive rock collection. I highly recommend this cd for fans of Genesis, Marillion, IQ, Pendragon, Arena, Jadis."
5,A must-have for Stranglers fans,"As others have said Hugh talks about every song in varying detail, though you may be disappointed when one of your favorites is only discussed briefly. Many have an interesting personal story attached to them as well. All notable events in the band's history are discussed. One thing I found interesting is Hugh's claim that he or JJ (John in the book) wrote all the music and lyrics before getting together w/ Dave and Jet to add the keyboards and base. Based on the finished product(s) I think he sells the other half of the band a little short."
3,"Cornwell Does Not Tell All, But He Does Not Need To!",This was a fairly quick read as Hugh Cornwell tells us his version of THE STRANGLERS history song by song. Using this format it is far from the full story that you could read in NO MERCY (the other Stranglers biography that Hugh claims is Jet Black's version even though he is not the author)As a fan of Hugh's music I truly enjoyed reading this.He tells the history of each song instead of a biography of The Stranglers. If you are a big Hugh fan as well you need this. A casual fan or someone looking for a true band biography should read No Mercy.
3,Caught,I thought it was pretty good. Seemed to drag in some points. I've always wanted to see Maria in a nude scene. She seemed a little awkward when she did them though but she is still beautiful.Great performances from the main actors....
1,the worst nudity movie i have ever seen in my life!!!!!!,i give this movie 1 star because there is way to much nudity in it ...my friend said that it is a bad movie and i ageri with her!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! and i wish thay never made this movie! and i mean it!!!!!...
5,A GREAT FIND,"I didn't even know this film existed until I ran across it on the Bravo channel; it is a real find.Although it is indeed a variation on The Postman Always Rings Twice, it certainly stands up on its own rights.The acting performanes are all excellent and the film is filled with suspense; the ending is not entirely predictable either"
4,helpful,"I think this book is a helpful guide. It is a quick, easy read when you are using it by the month. ""Baby Steps"" gives an accurate overview of where your child is at physically and emotionally--just as the title says. I feel like it sheds light on the mystery and subtlety of a new baby for a first time parent."
3,Good info but ...,"This book is full of good information, organized by 1 month per chapter. I only wish there was more information in each chapter, because I'm only reading the month my son is old, and its a quick read. Then I wait another month to read the next chapter. My biggest complaint, and I saw someone else said this also in a review when I ordered the book, is the print quality is awful. The printed text is blurred or smudged or missing in some places. Not sure I would order this again."
4,Informative Book,"This was one of my favorite books through my daughter's first 2 years. I liked that it was organized as a chapter for each month of development. I found the info to be very thorough. Development happens at a different pace for each child and there were months where I had slight panic that my daughter was behind. I learned though to apply a 3 month rule and I would find in a month or two she hit those development milestones. The author provides information periodically about critical developmental milestones your child should have reached. One other note, it is not a quick reference guide - it is a book you need to dedicate 15 minutes to read a chapter. I found it to be informative and the book I read consistently as my child grew in the first 2 years."
3,"It's interesting, but very scientific.","This book is interesting, but it's not really for general, light reading. It is very technical and scientific discussing the cognitive development of babies. I was looking more for a basic overview. It's a good book, but just a bit above my head and what I was looking for."
2,I am really surprised that everyone loved this book,I just purchased several baby books. I also ordered Your Baby's First Year by the AAP and Your Baby's First Year Week by Week by Glade Curtis and liked both books much better than the Baby Steps book. I felt like the book was not organized in an easy to read format. I like to see nice headers for the paragraphs to make it easy to find things. I did not find the book easy to read and have barely used it. I felt like I was reading a college text book.
5,MEG IS BACK!,"LOVED THIS BOOK! I was somewhat apprehensive to read her new book because I didn't want the let down her last book, All American Girl: Ready or Not. I have read all of her books and was discourraged at her last book, totally not the author I loved. But this book revived my love for her writing and hope there is a sequel to this gripping storyline. Deffinately suggest reading this one!"
1,Avalon High - Really?,"Sure, I'm almost 20 and that makes me not in the intended age group, but it was recommended by my sister who said it was a pretty good story. Sure, the story was good, but the execution? Terrible. By the end of the first chapter I was ready to get a pen and start crossing out instances of the word ""whatever."" I was a junior in high school not too long ago, and I never thought like that. It was almost painful to read in some parts.It was a giant waste of 2 hours. The story had so much potential, but it never even came close. Too bad I can't unread this."
3,Not Meg's Best...,"I would first off like to say that I love Meg Cabot, so please do not take this as a flame. I am also 18, which would also change any thoughts as, this is a Young Adult Book. I thought the plot line was perfect. Perfect, but the entire book seemed rushed. Even the chapters were short. I also think this would be a good start to a series. The characters were believable, even the quirky parents, but everything was much to rushed in my opinion (character development, emotions, etc). I would recommend getting it at the library."
5,Awesome read,This book was great! I usually hate teen fiction but I felt like I could relate to the main character. The book was so fun to read and I loved every page.
2,ugh already,didnt work for me. just like with all the guns amd stuff its like really. and comparing her with the lady of shalott. whoop dee doo. and its just like other meg cabot books. the hot populr guy madly in love with the tsll dorky girl. WELL WHERE HAVE WE SEEN THAT BEFORE??? oh i dont know maybe about evry meg cabot book??sry bouut all the typing errors not rly used to typing on kindle.
5,Review,I liked it all. I cannot point to any specific part of teh book that I enjoyed more than any other.
1,How could she have witten this?,"This is M. Cabot's worst novel EVER. Every other sentence consisted of ""like"", ""I mean"", and ""whatever""s. The story line could have been passable is the characters weren't so freaking slow. Come on they're supposed to be juniors and seniors and none of them could bring two and two together.And the stereotyping oh just because someone has a tattoo or a piercing means their a criminal? This book seems to say so.I was practically bored to death and I had to force myself to finish it.Not even worth the paper its printed on."
4,Good book for the pre-teen/teenager,"This is a good book for the pre-teen/teenager range. It is focused more to a female audience but guys could read it and enjoy it as well. It is a fresh take on the age-old story of Arthur and his court. If you are looking for something to read, and are interested at all in the Arthurian tale I would recommend this book."
3,What you see is what you get.,"This one was kind of a disappointment. I was hoping (especially after reading the blurb) that this would be different than Meg Cabot's usual style; maybe a bit deeper with all the mythology. No. Just no. In true Meg Cabot fashion, it was a chick-lit through and through. Instead of the intense, thrilling novel I was expecting, I got fluff. Just fluff. Maybe I set my expectations too high, but knowing the story of King Arthur, this novel didn't cut it for me."
4,"Different then what I am used to, but a good read",I found this book entertaining. The King Arthur modern stuff was a new twist that was kind of fun although a little weird. I recommend reading it.
4,Pretty Good Book,"I'm a huge fan of Meg Cabot, especially her Princess Diaries series. I liked this book very much. It doesn't top the Princess Diaries but it was still a great read and I'd advise anyone looking for a quick but intriguing read to get this book."
5,best book ever here is a age rage,"One of the best books ever. Marco says one bad word,he also call someone a bad name,two kissing sceans. But over all really amazing,I would say between the 10-15 age range."
4,One of the best of the breed,"Farnam's texts on defensive rifle and shotgun shooting are among the best available resources on the subject. The subject matter is covered in comprehensive fashion, with a fine attention to detail of the truly important aspects of defensive long gun handling and operation. While no substitute for taking one of Farnam's classes, this book can provide a sound foundation for the beginner and give even those with advanced defensive training several things to think about.The only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is that the book is slightly (but only slightly) dated in some regards and could use a revised edition, or an updated introduction or appendix to reflect on developments in firearms, ammunition, accessories, etc. since the original writing. Still, the book as-is is well worth the purchase price -- and then some."
4,The Farnam Method of Defensive Shotgun and Rifle Shooting,Yes I learned the differance between a carbine and a rifle and much more. Learn as much as you can from the masters of shooting. Nobody knows it all.
3,It's all right,"This DVD is okay. It's only a mix of clips from CKY2K and CKY3. It's still hilarious, don't get me wrong! But it'd be better if you get the whole versions of The CKY Box Set. It might cost more, but it's better"
2,lots of levels but way to easy,This game would have been a lot better if the levels were harder. I could just ollie the whole time and beet the game. Dont let the price fool you thats how much its worth. I would just save your money and bye Tony Hawk 2. The players dont even have names. One of the only good parts is that u can choos between skateboardind or rollerbladeing.
5,Practical Guide for Teaching Social Skills,"This is a wonderful book for teachers, parents or anyone who wants to become more effective in helping children to use good social skills. It is very practical and useful. Various skills that children frequently have difficulty with are broken down into simple steps, easy to master and practice. For example: How to Accept Criticism; How to Disagree; How to Accepts No for an answer. What is difficult and often vague is simpified for children in a very clever and interesting way. For this middle school teacher, it was a great help and a very effective and easy way to teach what is so often lacking and difficult for children this age."
3,GOOD CD,Like the music.Was wondering what happened to Buddy after Nashville Star and was glad to see he was still recording.
5,An Excellent Debut,"Buddy Jewell is the real deal. The man and his music are authentically country. This is real country music, not pop country or country rock, sung with passion and commitment by an enormously talented man.Buddy's voice is stunningly expressive. You feel these songs as much as hear them. Nowhere is this more evident than on the beautiful and moving ""Help Pour Out The Rain(Lacey's Song),"" one of my two favorites on the disc. My other favorite is ""Abilene On Her Mind."" Both of these songs were written by Buddy and they are truly modern classics.There are several other gems on the disc, as well. ""I Wanna Thank Everyone"" is a lot of fun, as is ""O'Reilly Luck."" Another Buddy composition, ""One In A Row,"" is a haunting and mournful country ballad in the classic style.Overall, this is simply a fantastic disc, one that I'll be playing over and over again. I can't wait to hear what Buddy Jewell does in the future. This man is going to be around for a long, long time."
5,"LOVE IT, LOVE IT, LOVE IT!!!","I picked the top three and Buddy to win the Nashville Star on the first show. Even my husband had to smile. I love Buddy's voice and his songwriting is wonderful. I have listened to country music my whole life like so many Americans, but this CD is one of the best I have ever bought. It is rare to like every song on it, but I just LOVED every song!!!!!! I will never get tired of this CD or this artist. Bring us some more soon!!!!!!!!"
5,GREAT NEW SINGER,I watched television the other day and saw a profile of a new country western singer by the name of Buddy Jewell. He was the winner of Nashville Star. I was so touched and moved by him and his music that I decided to buy his album..This is a great album. Very rarely do I buy a album where I like everything on it. One especially beautiful song he wrote is called Help pour out the rain. He is excellent and no one would be disappointed by this album.....Buy it....5 stars
5,THANK YOU FOR A BEATIFUL SONG,"TO ANYONE WHO LISTENS TO COUNTRY MUSIC, AND LOVES TO JUST SIT AND LISTEN SHOULD SIT AND LISTEN TO BUDDY JEWEL . I USED TO SIT AND LISTEN TO NEAL MCCOY ALL THE TIME , BUT SINCE I BOUGHT THE CD OF BUDDY JEWEL , I DONT KNOW OF ANY OTHER CD I WOULD RATHER REALLY SIT AND LISTEN TO BUT BUDDY JEWEL . THE SONG HELP POUR OUT THE RAIN BY BUDDY AND LACY HAS REALLY HELPED ME DEAL WITH THE LOSS OF MY GRANDDAUGHTER WHOM PASSED AWAY LAST YEAR FROM S.I.D.S. AT THE AGE OF 8 WEEKS OLD . SO TO ANYONE WHO HAS LOST SOMEONE THEY SHOULD SIT AND REALLY LISTEN TO BUDDY JEWEL. THANK YOU BUDDY AND LACY AND TO THE REST OF YOUR FAMILYSHERRY WATSON"
5,Buddy Jewell is the real deal,"Buddy Jewell's self-titled debut album has already produced a couple of solid hits, ""Help Pour Out The Rain(Lacey's Song)"" and ""Sweet Southern Comfort"". ""Help Pour Out The Rain"" is a touching song that Buddy wrote about his relationship with his daughter, and ""Sweet Southern Comfort"" is a tribute to country living. Other strong songs on this record are Buddy's cover of the classic Merle Haggard song ""Today I Started Loving You Again""; the somber ballads ""One In A Row"", ""Abilene On Her Mind"", and ""Why We Said Goodbye""; the wisecracking ""I Wanna Thank Everyone""; and ""I Can Get By"", the toe-tapping song that was written by Buddy's producer, Clint Black, and originally recorded by Clint. Unlike some other newer artists that have come onto the country music scene in recent years, Buddy has his roots in authentic country music. He's the ""real deal"" as far as music goes, and I look for him to be a solid country hit maker."
5,Buddy's the REAL deal!,"I never was a big country fan...a few songs here and there...but Nashville Star & Buddy Jewell made me re-think all that. I am convinced Nashville Star is the only reality show out there with REAL talent. We have been amazed at the quality of performers on that show.Buddy shined like the star he is the moment he first sang. I couldn't wait to buy his CD. I have not been disappointed. Whenever I tire of what's on the radio, I pop in my Buddy Jewell CD - it always bring a smile to my face (I Wanna Thank Everyone, Today I Started Loving You Again) or a welcome tear to my eye (Help Pour Out the Rain)Buddy Jewell is an example of what makes music great!"
5,Buddy is the Bomb!,"I fell in love with Buddy Jewell's personality and voice during the TV show Nashville Star. Since buying his CD, I'm even more amazed at his vocal talent! He manages to put real ""country"" heart and soul into every song. Typically when I buy a CD, I like only a few of the songs -- well, I love all of the songs on this CD. Such variety, but all really great!!! Buddy, you are the bomb! Move over Toby and Tim!P.S. Keep your Christian message going!"
3,Very good historical novel,"I was impressed with this novel, which I found while searching for biographies of Henry VII of England. The author really made the time period come alive. I would recommend it to anyone interested in the life of Henry VII; the Wars of the Roses and just English history in general. By the way, it's not a ""trashy"" novel, so for those of you looking for romance/historical, this one's not. But it's very interesting and well-written novel about the early life of Henry VII, and the machinations that brought him to the throne of England."
2,a little mixed up !,"i have to say i was very dissapointed with some of the tracks on here,i was around djing at the time and i cant see where some of these tracks fit in.situation good pop tune,genius of love,the glamourous life all pop tunes as i recall.extended 12"" mixes were quite rare and you could not sustain a full dancefloor playing them all the way through.classic tracks,havent you heard, feel for you,groove in the heart,good times.all dance floor fillers and to me thats what the rest of the tracks are -fillers.a mix of a cd ,not put together with any thought,but hey thats just my opinion."
1,Scam----,"Are you crazy? I never received the sander, even though I paid for it and it ran through my bank, so the dealer got his money; but I received NOTHING !!!"
1,"Sour, not sweet",This is probably one of the worst re-records I have heard. It lacks the energy and intensity of the original recordings. Save your money!
3,"Good Documentary, nothing extraordinary","I bought this DVD back in 2007. At first I thought it was a documentary about the first cases of Alien Abductions ( the cover is a little bit misleading ), so I was disappointed at first, but then I watched the documentary a second time and thought it was a very interesting documentary, talking about a lot of interesting sightings who took place in the past and even in the bible. It's a good buy, but buy it if the DVD is less than 20$, if it's over 20$ then don't buy it, after all this Doc. is only 50 minutes long. But it's a good addition to a collection."
1,Gold Kili All Natural Instant Ginger Tea Drink,"Having tried many other ginger-related beverages with meager interest, I was fortunate to have stumbled upon this one through a friend. It had the best flavor with that desired ginger ""bite"" throughout the drink. I feel satisfied and relaxed after having had my regular end-of-the-day cup. Therefore, I have become quite a big fan of this product...I just wish it were easier to find!!!"
3,YEs,"Mine wasnt brand new, but it got the job done.Sweet! I've just received my free Riot Points!>> FreeRiotPoints.me <<"
4,Pretty Good!,"My main worry was the possibility of receiving a N64 controller with the typical loose joystick and stuck buttons. For the most part, the red controller I got was amazing, because the joystick is not loose, and all the buttons are functional. However, the only flaw I have noticed is the stiffness of clicking the ""L"" button while playing.Overall, I would encourage anyone interested in playing the N64 classics to give it a shot and get the good quality controllers."
4,A naturalist must read,"The book is a touching story about a man who saves a baby beaver and nurses it until maturity. The author does not try to impress you with lingo rather you get the impression that he is just down to earth . If you love beavers this is a wonderful book . P.S,. Really good for young readers."
1,It Was Okay,"This Cd was okay. There was too much profanity and their sound was not anything different from all the rap stars out there today. They tried too hard to sound professional and there was more S*x and profanity in their songs than all most rap stars. All I can say is ""I hope that they have better luck next time."" This Cd was not anything exceptional. If you want to listen to real rap, go buy an Eminem CD!"
5,What is the slope of that hill?,This tool is indispensable for finding the slope of a hill. I am planning on using it to rough out a path for a roadway up the side of a hill. Amazon is the place to buy this tool...my local tool store wanted $25 more than I paid here for the same exact tool.
1,buyer beware,If you buy this video thinking it is the miniseries starring Sam Neill your in for a terrible surprise as I was. It is a rap video with a black duo called Kane and Abel.
1,"Wrong, wrong, wrong~!!!!!!!!!!!!","I use IMDB.com to search for old movies I want, which is also an Amazon owned company. This is a gross error on the part of whoever cross-references this. It is NOT the mini-series with Peter Strauss and Sam Neill, so DON'T buy it~!!"
1,Dazed and confused!,"I have just received this video and it is unopened and will remain so, as it is NOT what I thought I was buying. I THOUGHT that I was buying the mini-series KANE & ABEL, starring Sam Neil and Peter Strauss, from the book by Jeffrey Archer. What a surprise to receive what I got. Confused? You bet! And easily so since there was a listing for the Jeffrey Archer book on the same page."
5,Hypnotic style,"This CD seems to be based on principles of hypnosis or trance-like relaxation. It begins with a certain pace and tone that is similar to one's presumed present pre-relaxed state. Then the pace and tone subtly change to reflect the relaxation that is occurring. The CD ends with a period of relaxing ""hearts of space"" type of music that is conducive to ""floating off"". The spoken part is repetitive and trance-like to achieve its desired effect. It should be useful for those needing assistance falling to sleep."
1,Very Annoying!,"I just had to write a review and warn people that this is definitely not the greatest choice for relaxation. The woman (...) who is speaking, first of all, has a very callous sound to her voice, in that it sounds ""mean"" and almost like she doesn't want to be doing this. I felt like it was a bit condescending. Also, throughout her ""meditation,"" she is CONSTANTLY talking, repeating the same lines over and over--I mean, excessively! My husband and I were trying to listen to it when we went to bed one night to help us fall asleep, and we couldn't help but break out laughing a few times because she sounds so ridiculous. We then switched over to the second CD I had purchased at the same time as this one (The Gift of Relaxation by Barry Pitkoff), and it was like a breath of fresh air--it was awesome! We listen to that one every night now, and I sleep like a baby. This ""Just Relax"" one, however, I just want to stomp on and throw out the window. What a waste of [money]."
5,Asleep in five minutes,"My wife got me your CD because I was stressed. When she handed it to me I said, ""What's this? It's never gonna work!"" But I figured I'd try it anyway just to make her happy. So I put it on and fell asleep in five minutes."
4,not for everyone,"If you liked 'transylvania 6-5000', and enjoy british comedy, i.e. bean, monty python, black adder, then this might be for you. I laughed throughout the movie, rent it and see what you think! i hope you enjoy it. lars"
2,Pretty weak,"Was looking forward to seeing this with two of my favorite British comedians (Smith and Jones), but this was VERY weak....maybe one genuine laugh throughout. Mostly lackluster comedy will be forgotten minutes after viewing."
4,"New Brunswick, NJ at it's best !","This is a great cd from a local NJ band that has appeal to fans of many types of music...be it rock , punk, or even metal. Alf Bartone has a voice that draws in the listener. The lyrics are very catchy. Buy it now before you are not able too. Currently, the band is no more. If you were fortunate to see them live...they rocked! This will especially appeal to fans of Shades Apart , Dag Nasty, and ALL. Long live Alf!These songs should be on the radio."
5,"Ying Zhu, ""Chinese Cinema during the Era of Reform""","Dr. Ying Zhu's book is a wonderful introduction to the post-Maoist Chinese film industry. Useful to both scholars and in classrooms, it presents a picture of a film world that is relatively unknown to most Americans, but may not be for long. Balancing the impact of globalization and Hollywood with national needs, Chinese cinema, like Chinese industry in general, may be the coming wave. This book will give you a head start in understanding why."
1,What a weird bird,"Who cares about that weird bird. I hate this cartoon character. Sometimes I wish Sylvester would just grab that weird bird, put the bird in his mouth, & then swallow the bird. This bird doesent talk right. Thats whats so weird about this bird. I dont have a looney tune character I like. So far I also hate Elmer."
1,What a weird bird,"Who cares about this weird bird. I hate this cartoon character. Sometimes I wish Sylvester would just grab Tweety, put him in his mouth, & swallow him. If Tweetys head is way to big Sylvester should use a shink ray. This cartoon doesent talk right. Thats whats so weird about this bird. I dont have a looney tune character I like. So far I also hate Elmer."
5,The Girls Say That This Book Is A Keeper.,"This book is ideal for horse crazed kids as well as adults. Nicely bound, nicely arranged, with lots of photos and descriptive language. Is this the encylopedia for horsing? No. But it is an enjoyable book that delivers what it promised."
4,Fine overview,"Texas After the Civil War could have been a stronger book if it had utilized primary sources more. Nonetheless, Carl Moneyhon's work is a fine overview of the Period between 1865 and 1872 when Democrats regained the state government. Many old Texas histories claim that Reconstruction was an awful experience, marred by bayonet-rule, outrageous behavior by black militia units, and suppression of basic democracy. Moneyhon shows that was not quite the case; interestingly noting that the fall of white voter participation came not from official disenfranchisement, but from unwillingness to participate in post-Confederate government.Politics are covered most thoroughly, but Moneyhon also give space to Republican attempts to develop the Texas economy. The first decade of black freedom is also discussed at some length. Less space is devoted to postwar life for former Confederates.Worth checking out for anyone interested in Texas history or Reconstruction."
2,Buyer beware!!!!,"The songs are great but where are all the instruments? If you dont care that they've been all replaced by synthesizers on this CD or claim you can't tell the difference, then by all means- disfrute!"
1,Disappointing,"I think I had the wrong expectation, but I loved Lagerfeld Confidential and there was incredible music sprinkled throughout that documentary-- it was a great eclectic mix. I guess I expected something similar, but instead this seems a bit more on the weird and (*sigh*) pretentious end. And it's overpriced."
1,Not suitable for acrylic tanks!,"Despite the product information stating that these will not damage acrylic tanks, the product left awful scratches on my tank the first time I used it! To add insult to injury, it did a very poor job removing algae. I just ended up with patches of algae streaked by the scratches in the tank. Don't waste your time and money with this product.If you're looking for algae control in a freshwater tank, I would strongly recommend getting a couple Olive Nerite snails instead of wasting your money on a Mag-Float that will do more harm than good. Olive Nerite snails are voracious little algae eaters that will keep your tank spotless and can't reproduce in freshwater, so they won't overrun your tank. I purchased two of these snails for less than I spent on the Mag-Float that ended up in the trashcan."
5,great product,"very good product for my tank, cleans well and came very quickly. Brand new in package. I can't complain with this product at all"
4,Love It,"I bought this for my smaller aquarium. It worked so well that I bought the next larger size for my larger aquarium. It cleans the glass well and is very easy to install and use. It ""parks"" in the back corner of my aquarium so that it is not visible when not in use. I find this accessory very useful."
1,Not pleased.,"The item arrived in time stated, but was not happy with the way it worked becuase it did not work. It did not take off any algae. Will not buy this product and do not recommend it."
5,THE BEST!,THIS IS THE BEST WATERING CAN I HAVE EVER USED. BE CAREFUL WITH CHOOSING THIS 2 GALLON SIZE BECAUSE IT IS QUITE HEAVY WHEN FILLED ALL THE WAY UP. CHOOSE THE QUART SIZE ONE.
3,OK,"I bought this as a gift because it was OXO, and my sister in law has everything in her kitchen and outside OXO. To me it was just a watering can, but she really liked it."
1,'Why do people make something so simple so complicated',"The Editorial Review above says it all - suitable for university libraries only. And Mr. Blau is so big-headed too. And he thinks Beckett's own attempts at directing were too 'literal' whereas his, of course, are clever. Clever by extending the opening mime in Endgame to 12 minutes? Beckett shorted and simplified it, at the Schiller Theatre. Beckett thought Endgame should last 75 minutes, Blau 2 hours. Yawn, yawn.Nothing more to say, as the book is unreadable to anyone outside the freemasonry of academia. You all ought to take a leaf out of the scientists' book; make yourself accessible, become 'sexy'. It really is not that difficult to speak simply; as Sam knew!"
4,This Game Was GREAT!,"EA has done it again! This time, they brought back the epic adventure based on the novel by J.K. Rowling. With fun features and exciting settings, you'll want to play day after day after day! The bad parts are: you can only save at special places (what if I get stuck somewhere? :(), the game ends VERRRRY quickly, the Chamber of Secrets is WAAAAY too easy, and everyone in the game has no life! (You'll see why if you buy, CHA-CHING!) The adventure never stops, and your heart quickens with every step. Every spell is exciting, and every turn you make can alter the course of your path."
2,It is too old,"It is make for the first Xbox...but it was my mistake I guess, 'cause I didn't realize on time. Anyway..."
1,I liked it at first...,"When we first got this game, we were all impressed. It was fun and looked nice. As some reviews have stated, it is usually very clear what you are supposed to do at each stage of the game. In an effort to not have the game be too simple, EA seems to have decided to make the controls just twitchy enough so it takes you potentially dozens of tries to accomplish certain tasks. All in all it is not an enjoyable game for us. The ""challenges"" are challenging in an annoying not entertaining way. In the end, I don't reccomend this game at all."
2,"VERY, VERY, VERY dissapointing","This game is the worst game I have ever played! ok, so not as bad as Syberia for xbox but bad enough that I would rate it 2 stars! even though the storyline is ok, the game ended to quickly. Also, the battle scenes (Harry practicing his magic on the washing machine) was very fake and very boring. The washing machine moved in a pattern all the time so there was no surprise to what it would do next.If you ever want to play this game, I suggest that you should be able to withstand the annoying save games (you can't allways save the game whenever you want). So go ahead and give it a try if you aren't afraid of wasting your money."
3,Much Too Short,"In three words that really sums it up for me. The game itself is pretty fun, but I ended up beating it in a day because it was just too short. I was also disappointed with the ending being much too easy and hurried. Additionally, I second whoever wrote in their review that the camera angles are just not helpful and that the issue of losing your beans every time you're hit is such a pain. I suppose that was it really.. most of the levels are pretty fun, just not long enough."
5,Cute and fun game.,"I loved playing Harry and the animation, music, and settings are beautiful. I only wish the teachers played a more important part and Gilderoy exposed like in the book and movie.Also, Aragog was more tough to beat than the Basilisk, but still I enjoyed this game and have played it many times since."
3,"Works well, stores very little","This is an excellent memory card; however, it is sadly only 32 MB. I use it for the Lyra MP3 player and it is very easy to use, fairly quick storage and I have never had any problems."
5,You'll love this one!,"An excellent adventure story and autobiography, filled with narrow escapes. Mr. Armstrong has led a varied career with many interests, and is living proof that there are no ""Old, bold pilots""."
2,Monologues not well-chosen,"This book was a real disappointment. I am not sure if the editor was lazy or used whatever source material was the cheapest or what. Out of 100+ selection for men, maybe 3 or 4 were at all useful. There are much, MUCH better monologue anthologies out there - pass on this one and keep looking!"
3,Not funny at all,"I purchased this book after purchasing Vol. 4 (222 Comedy Monologues 2 Minutes & Under). It's alright, if you're not looking for any comedy. The closest it comes to is ""Serio-Comic"", and even those are only slightly amusing. Although it covers a great range of time periods and ages, I still get more use out of the comedic collection found in Vol. 4"
4,good monologhues,"This book has a good range of monolugues. But if your looking to really looking to learn how to audition, set yourself apart and create your own projects, read Twelve Step Plan To Becoming An Actor In LA it's a new book and it is the most helpful book i have found in the last coujple of years.Tom SaryoryNYC"
4,Godzilla is a blast,"This game is really fun because it's challenging and the levels get harder and harder. You can choose Adventure, Team Battle, Destruction and more. It's really hard at first because it's hard to learn the controls, but once you get used to it, it's really fun. Even though you have to earn a chance to chose a new monster to fight, you have lots of monsters to chose from."
4,Monster madness!!!...,"This game is awesome times. It has kicks, punches, and you can swing your tail like a mad man. you also have a special attack like fire for Godzilla. but sometimes in adventure mode you feel like the game is favoring the computer enemy. But when it does not feel like that then this game is awesome. I would recomend it to anyone that wants it and already has a few games so if your mad at it you have something else to play.I also reccomend Sonic Aventure 2 battle and super smash bros melee"
5,a great game!,it is good i havent won a new character yet but i got to mechagodzilla like 6 times but i never beat him but 1 time i got him to a quorter of life i like megalon and my friend likes anghuirus and my cousin likes godzilla 90s for now that is (i like every one)i want to find out the mystery monster my friend says its orga but i dont no for sure.
4,Monsterous Destruction!,"If you are a fan of Godzilla,I recommend this game to you.You may think that to pick from 11 different monsters is crummy, but once you get those new ones and use them in multiplayer,man,you will blow your friends away.Not to mention,you can tear buildings out of the ground and wack the opponent with it.The images and graphics on all the monsters just makes you re-think about returning the game.But if you just like old-school destruction,then I think you should just buy a game called Rampage.Good Luck"
4,This Game....,"STINKS. I hate godzilla. The only point that people remeber is ""AAAHHHH GODZILLA"" [dies] itz so boring. i mean come on the graphics are horrible, and itz not much of a fighting game. ( yea fight your mind to not burn the game!!!) Hey you might as well play Bob the Builder at least itz good for u!!!"
4,THIS IS A GOOD GAME!!!,"This is a good game.It takes a while to get used to, but after a while you will be a pro.It takes stratagy to win. You can't charge in and expect to win( unless you are playing with one of the starting characters).I have all monsters and levels. The more monsters you get the harder it gets,but the monsters get tougher so no big deal.If you have Super Smash Bros.Melee get this game. They are both fun, except the monsters are a little on the slow side. If you don't have Super Smash Bros.Melee get it too.Check Cheat Code Central for awsome codes on this game!"
5,Oh yah!!,"This game is the coolest!! I mean, trust me, if you havn't bought it yet then you really, really should. With Godzilla 2000, one of his throw moves is he picks up a guy, spins him around, throws him up into the air and then when he comes back down Godzilla punches him halfway across the arena. If you like wrestling and you like Godzilla then you have to get this game! You have to!"
2,Stew,"Fun game, but lack control of characters that you play as, and to slow of characters that you play as. Also not really a fare challenge because of this."
3,challinging fighting game with sluggish monsters,"This game is fun but sometimes can get fustrating. Sometimes its satisfying beating down a tough monster. There is an Adventure mode but however, defeating a monster won't unlock it. I disliked the part of the game a lot. The sound effects are loud and exiting. Overall, this is the type of game I'd just rent."
2,Very Disapointing,This is a fun game but only if u have 2 or more people to play with i was kind of dissapointed because i thought this was going to be a cool game dont waste your money instead buy super smash Bros.
3,"The game is OK, but the setup [is bad]",The game's overall play is OK. The only thing I didn't like was the fact that it started off with only 3 playable characters. You have to beat 8 monsters to unlock each character. Meaning you have to beat the same 8 monsters 8 times to unlock all 8 characters.
1,The save function does not work,This would be a good boxing style game but the save function did not work on my copy. Until the software manufacturer works the bugs out I say avoid this product.
1,Cheaply Made - Poor Design,"My son's fish tank has never had so much algae since we switched to using this type of filter. There's no 'frame' surrounding the sponge to keep it in place and on top of that, it's made of two separate pieces that are not even connected together and you have to fiddle with it over and over to get it to stay in place. Even then, it still can move around or even dislodge completely. These have to be replaced constantly, nearly every week. I would strongly suggest looking into something that's made better and more substantially."
4,Tom Explodes on A-Tom-Ic Jones,"Tom Jones third album A-Tom-Ic Jones still finds the singer working more late 50's ealy 60's style rock music and not the country western hits and big band era ballads that dominated his recordings into the 70's. Here, most of the songs are originals, including ""ThunderBall"", a trans-atlantic Top 40 hit that served as theme song to the fourth James Bond movie. from tender ballads sung in understated style like ""Where Do You Belong"" to all out rockers like ""This and That"", Jones voice and charisma shine effortlessly. This is the last of the ""old era"" Tom Jones albums before his music moved towards more adult, less teen oriented sounds. A classic buy all Tom Jones will enjoy that is often overlooked in his catalogue of million selling album releases."
5,Early Tom at his Best,"This CD has early Tom Jones with some really great numbers. Some of the less often heard songs include In a Woman's Eyes, Where Do You Belong and These Things You Don't Forget. But these are truly wonderful and I especially love them. Tom's voice is young, strong and on several of the numbers, quite bluesy. You won't go wrong on this CD if you are a TJ fan."
4,Classic Dynamite,A wonderful collection of powerful songs from Tom Jones.In the songs and in the power of the voice the engerycan be heard. If you like Tom's early work you will enjoythis CD.
2,Tedious Speculation,"I love biographies of historical figures but this one was a disappointment from the beginning...and a plodding read, to boot.All it really manages to confirm is that politics is a dirty business and that corruption & deception are part and parcel of it all. The more things change, unfortunately, the more they stay the same.As for Mrs. Wilson, she wouldn't be the only First Lady in history who was more of a WIFE than a politician!"
3,Disappointing,"Being a fan of presidential biographies and after having read some books on both of the Wilsons, I was very excited to see what appeared to be a dual biography of the couple. Levin's book was dry and downright boring . It is a very interesting and debatable premise....whether Edith Wilson really ""ran"" the White House when Woodrow was incapacitated by stroke.My complaints are that the book was much more Woodrow than Edith and I am still not sure I feel like I buy Levin's theme that Edith was the first female president.I was surprised to learn just how incapacitated Wilson was and how little the country was aware of.This could have been a much better book."
2,It must be me,"Checking the other customer (and editorial) reviews, I find that no one had the reaction I did - this is a very poorly written book on an interesting subject. Author Levin wears her agenda on her sleeve from Page One, repeatedly skews the narrative to her own purposes, and fails to footnote responsibly.What's more, her chronology is so haphazard, and she skips around so much, that the reader is never quite sure what year or country we're in at any given time, or what the heck is going on, or who said what to whom.Add a boatload of odd editorial boo-boos and you have a very disappointing book."
4,Love the Greedy Triangle,"I teach third grade and my students loved this story. I read it at the beginning of our unit on polygons and they thoroughly enjoyed it! I lent it to several other teachers who used it in this unit as well. All the kids, low to high, really got it and it is a good way to introduce all the shapes!"
4,Help your child enjoy math,I really liked this book - very whimsical! It would be great for kids who are just learning about shapes as well as those who need to review.
4,The Greedy Triangle: A Great Find,"I am currently a student (...). I read The Greedy Triangle to a second grade class and they loved it! This book is great for elementary age students because it indroduces geometry in a fun way. The story begins with a triangle not being happy with himelf and wanting to change into another shape. The triangle then on each page gets another side which changes him into a different geometric shape. The book also gives the names of the different geometric shapes and associates the shapes with everyday items that kids can relate to. At the end of the story the triangle decides he was happy just being a triangle. This book gives a message to kids to be happy and proud of who they are. I would recommend this book for elementary school teachers, it was a great find!"
4,The Greedy Triangle,"The Greedy Triangle is a good book for children to read and learn the shapes in every live object.The book talks about how a triangle gets bored with his shape which is a triangle. The triangle changes from it's shape to a circle, pentogon, square, rectangle and other shapes.He says how fun is his life of being a triangle or the other shapes. He gives examples of every shape he changes into. It's a fun way to learn the shape of object!"
3,The Greedy Triangle,"This story has a very fun way for you to learn about shapes. A triangle that is unhappy with his shape asks the shape shifter to change him by adding lines. Temporarily happy with his new shape, he asks to be changed again and again. Will the greedy triangle ever find the perfect shape? You will definately take something away from this story. This story is mainly focused on children over 3 years of age."
3,So-so,"A bit of a disappointment. Illustrations looked good online. Construction is more flimsy than an activity book. I don't think it will hold up to a four-year old or younger, and that's it's audience."
5,The Greedy Triangle still rocks!,"The paperback version of Marilyn Burns' tale of a dissatisfied triangle is bright, colorful and full of real life references. Children grasp the concepts of polygons and their uses through this fun story of a triangle who ends up alienating its friends after visiting the shapeshifter far too many times. Discovering in the end, ""there's no place like home!""Greedy Triangle (Scholastic Bookshelf)"
5,"5 Patterns is the ""7 habits"" book for careers","This is a great book. It's an easy read with research based case studies to explain the 5 patterns of the book. It would be valuable addition to the bookshelf of anyone who takes his/her career seriously.I was turned on to this book by a review in the NY Times.They also offer a job survival guide at the web site for the book, which is fivepatterns.com."
5,Every Career Will Benefit From Understanding These Patterns,"With more than thirty years in business and the military I can confirm that this book really describes the patterns of behavior of top managers I've worked for, but just a importantly highlights what's missing in those who were less than great. Things to think about no matter what your career or position."
3,Great Insight but Reads Like an Infomercial for Harvard Business School,"This book offers great insight into behaviors that create an extraordinary career. However, it would have been nice if Mssrs. Citrin and Smith had come down from the ivory tower long enough to do more research in fields other than business.All of the examples in the book are taken from the business world but, contrary to reviewer Chuang's opinion below, I believe these principles work equally well in technical and artistic fields. Most of the examples are Harvard Business School alums who started in consulting (Bain, McKinsey) or investment banking and then moved over to the client side.There are far more examples that could and should have been explored other than the execs the author's firm handles."
3,Foundations of good career strategy,"A good book overall, I still would rate it only 3/5 because I felt it was mostly oriented towards the white collar professional and big money. It's 5 main concepts were broad enough to cover the important dimensions in career strategy without clouding them in details. This book reveals what the authors have concluded from their research in working with thousands of successful upper management types. Nonetheless, I felt like I got more out of ""The 21 Irrefutable Laws of Leadership"" because my weakness is in the area of leadership skills, but 5 Patterns also emphasises the importance of leadership skills. Both are worth reading."
5,Stuck? Read this!,"Ok. Raise your hand if you think that if you show up and work hard you can have an extraordinary career. Hah! And I have some land in Florida to sell you......You need this book. As a matter of fact, everyone with a job could use this book. Not only does it profile real individuals who have used the five patterns and who have made the patterns work for them, but there is a highly-useful job survival guide in the back.Find out how to get out of a rut and jump-start your career. Find out how to present yourself to employers to get that next great position. And, most importantly, give yourself the gift of success."
1,Amazon protects sellers at expense of customers,Norcal Bookfinders sent a copy of The University Wine Course with all the exercises filled in with red and black ink and badly water damaged. Don't trust Amazon seller ratings - My Account site is not allowing me to leave negative feedback
2,Too many typos in the ebook,"While the information contained in the book is excellent, the many typos, wrong words and general lack of copyediting make for a frustrating read, especially if you are attempting to answer the review questions. These errors are present in the ebook version."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS TAPE!,"The reproduction quality of these cartoons on this tape is atrocious. You will do better recording your own off the TV. I don't understand why Videomatic International Corp. bothers to record and package something this shoddy. Washed out, scratchy...simply terrible. Too bad, cause there are a couple classic Bob Clampett WWII era toons on there. There is also one with an embarrassing racial stereotype, that was redone later with Elmer Fudd scene for scene. Of slight historical interest. Anyway, save your money; you are warned, this tape stinks. Wish someone had warned me."
1,This tape is sacrilegious!,"The quality [stinks]. The tape [stinks]. Generic label (as in black text, white label). Static screen, color washout, not worth the price of the tape it was recorded on (and at SLP to boot).If you buy this tape, you WILL regret it.It is sacrilegious to record Bugs Bunny with such poor quality!Man, I wish I read the reviews first...."
1,pirate video copy,This is pirate video (video of a video). The quality is awful!! We sent ours back. I had no idea I was ordering a pirate video. Do not order this video!!
2,Not The Classic Bugs You Are Looking For,"Those who expect the wise cracking chuck jones and friz freling bugs are looking at the wrong title. This is a collection of early bugs cartoons before he has his fully developed persona. I would only reccomend it for die hard fans who want everything, otherwise you will not get you hope for."
5,An Awesome Classic,"This movie will go down in history. These classic cartoon shorts will keep you in stitchs. This tape is a ledgend reborn. The others wrote about the terrible quality of the movie. Well newsfalsh they they didn't have HDTV in 1941. The ""Falling Hare"" episode is awesome it's about when they had the big hoax about Gremlins in the 40's. This made fun of it. A Gremlin Met Bugs and was trying to explode a dumbbomb with a hammer and I won't spoil the rest of it. This Tex Avery, Mel Blanc short is probably the best episode of all time. The rest is genuine Classic.DON'T LISTEN TO THE OTHER REVEIWS! If your a true blue Bugs fan you will love it no matter what."
2,"Filter is fine, advertised for wrong car",This does not fit a 2007 Audi RS4 like advertised on the amazon.com web site. After I had my oil drained and pulled the old filter out I find out that this thing is too big and won't fit in the stock RS4 filter housing. I had to then put the old one back in and drive 24 miles out to Maplewood Audi to get the real one that works from Audi. Amazon is good overall but this experience stunk.
2,So Much More,"On reading this book, one gets the distinct impression that Gautama Chopra is capable of so much more. Why he chooses to take the easy road and write about something that would be commercially viable given his father's empire, I'm not sure. There are glimpses of wonderful talent in this book, as evinced when the protagonist Hakim runs across a meditative dancer: It seems as if Gautama has based the character of the beautiful dancer on a girl he's been in love with. His descriptions are breathtaking. But I'd like to see him break new ground, away from the self-help spirituality track, and write a piece of fiction that comes from his own heart, and most importantly, from his own mind--no one else's."
5,this game is better than live 2003 for sure(fo sua),man all yall people always complain about how junk a game is man you can say there is no yao in this so what so still can have fun with this game you say live 2003 is better so what its your opinion that your saying let everyone who wants to play this game find out i say this game is good and good graphics and more i really like this game and yall people can say you dont like it so dont talk about it revie something good about this game if you say someting bad say it to your self man if you complain your a baby so dont complain say something good
3,Tough call,"My friends and I decided to rent a game. Unfortunately, NBA Live 2004 was not available so we picked this up instead. We're pretty experienced gamers, having played a few incarnations of NBA Live and the NBA 2K series.I won't comment much as this is an old game, but the game was slightly disappointing to me. Maybe I played NBA Live 2004 too much, but 2K3 just felt very sluggish. The passing system was not very good and I had difficulty getting a feel for the game. No matter what people say about NBA Live 2004, the game play felt much more fluid.However, if you're interested in seeing how this game is, feel free to give it a shot, especially if you've played NBA 2K2 before."
3,OK game but is kind of dissapointing,"I like the game, but the thing about it is that like Max from Santa Monica said, the controls are way too choppy, and the rosters are messed up. The non-superstar players are the only ones on the right teams, and some like Yao Ming, Melvin Ely and others are not even in the game. Hopefully the internet update/play will help that. If you like B-ball though, you will play so much and get adapted to the controls and everything. I think that Sega could have done a better job, and they should have relased the game later in the month to have more updated/accurate rosters. And the only other thing is the stupid 'fade away' jumpers. I know the game should be relistic, but this is a video game. no one in the league does a 'fade away' jumper as much, and as weak as the game MAKES you do."
3,Go back to the drawing board,"Listen ya'll...I switched from the NBA live series the 1st time I played NBA 2k2 an now it looks like I've got to switch back. The passing control is horrible and they took away the last man back pass option which really slows down the game. On the pro and allstar levels, players miss too many easy baskets...now I will say that the graphics, dunks, and other extras are second to none...but that passing makes this game a drag to play."
2,What a let down,"After 2K2, I was so pumped to get this game. 2K2 was hands down the best basketball game ever. 2K3 is one of the owrst. Everything that was fun about last year's games is gone. Lst year, players cut to the basket, used screens, actually seemed to have a pretty realistic A.I., what happened?? Don't even get me started on the passing. NBA Live 2003 has it's faults, but is far superior to 2K3, better luck next year Sega."
5,There is no other,"The best review I read so far hit it right on the head...this game is the Madden of basketball games. That is all you really need to know. If you want realism...right down to the upper office, NBA 2K3 is your game. If you want arcade style basketball (see NBA Jam 1992) then get NBA Live 2003. I do recommend however, even for you experienced Sega Sports vets out there, that you start off on Rookie mode. It can get frustrating as you learn the different nuances of the game, because there are MANY. All in all this will have everything you are looking for in a b-ball sim, from the die hard serious fan to the 12-year old T-Mac era fan...this is your game."
4,Hoop Fans - Buy 2K3 Now,"Much improved title from Sega. I highly recommend it for gamers looking for a more ""realistic"" experience. If b-ball sims aren't for you, try Live 2003 for more of an arcade like experience.Outstanding gameplay, lifelike graphics, and attention to details (AI has different cornrows, Ben Wallace sports the 'fro at times and 'rows at others, Q does his patented head-knock move) make this an overall must-have for hoop fans. The inclusion of ESPN broadcast presentation adds to its realism and enjoyment.One question: Where's Yao???? He is not in the game."
1,No multiplayer franchise or season mode!?!?!?!?!,"NBA 2k3 has excellent gameplay, excellent feel, excellent realism and excellent graphics. I was so excited about this game, and playing the actual games definitely lives up to the hype. Here's the problem: not only is there not a multi-player franchise mode, the makers of the game actually REMOVED the multi-player season mode! This boggles my mind. Part of the fun of sports games is being able to play them with other people. March Madness 2002 erred greatly by removing these features, and I'm incredibly sad to say that Sega Sports made the same mistake with NBA 2K3."
2,Intec Wireless Racing Wheel,"The only problem with this Racing Wheel is it takes a long time to sync up so you can play. It has taken up to 13 minutes sometimes. Once the Racing Wheel connects to the PS2, it works fine."
1,"great controller, simply won't last","this is the best racing wheel I have used on the ps2.....it is ashamed that they don't do a better job of making this wheel. I have, to date, gone through three of these in the course of a year. If you use it at all, or turn hard into a corner, the internal stops that keep the wheel from turning any further one direction or the other simply snap off. If you manage to not get aggressive and you don't snap them off, then in about 4 months or so of medium use, the whole wheel becomes so loosely held together that the electrical contacts stop working. Either way, the wheel is only good for about 4 months of use"
3,Pretty Good,"This game is pretty good. I prefer Mario type games and I thought this may be similar, but with different characters and different locations. I suppose it is similar to Mario type games, but with a 'jungle-ish' twist. Not for kids under 8 or 9, unless they are really good. Not because of violence, but because of difficulty level."
1,don't get it,"My buddy who'd read this book gave it to me. Having worked in gaming, I was certainly intrigued. Having read the book, I can honestly say ""I don't get it"". I've been in this casino industry for 20 years and have never seen or heard many of the things Mr. Brotherton discusses. Merv Griffin and Chuck Norris holding the author hostage in Moscow??? Something tells me that this would have made national headlines. The author has a good imagination but this boook seems to be more more fiction than non-fiction. If you want to learn about the industry there are far better reads out there, than this."
2,Swelled head writes accurate character portrayals,"I used to work for Players before John & I have to tell you that he hits the nail on the head with all of his character portrayals of the partners, council and employees. I have never met him but I somehow doubt that he is the Superhero that he descibes for himself. And he needs writing lessons. But I found it fascinating to read about these people that I knew & see them act & hear them say things that are so typical. So maybe what he describes is actually true. Because of the personal connection it was a great read for me."
5,A Fistful of Kings By John Brotherton,"This is a wonderful book. It is written by a man who has been through really trying times but has come out on top.I know that every word of this book is true, however you really put that aside and feel as though you are reading a fantastic thrilling piece of fiction. Knowing that John and his wife Susan actually experienced every emotion and had to deal with those moment by moment and make a life or death decision so many times will keep you very close to this book until the very end.Give this one a try. It will enlighten you about Louisana Politics, the part private business and yes even celebrities play in the gambling industry in Louisiana the USA and even Russia. There is a little romance for the romantic.Thanks John for the good read."
5,The truth is backed up by FBI documentation,"I don't know who ""A Reader From Moscow"" is (unless they are in the book, but I followed the investigation and trial and saw Brotherton's part for myself). I saw the Alan Katz show in New Orleans and when he said it was the best political book he had ever read, I ordered it. After receiving the book, I read it all the way through without putting it down. I was expecting a ""tell all"" expose' and got a lot more than that. Now my wife is reading it. I very strongly recommend it, especially for the entertainment value. This would make a good movie, I think."
1,Stay away! Do not buy this product!,"I've had this driver for about a year and it worked most of the time (not always, but most of the time). Then one day I needed to reinstall my bluetooth drivers and it stopped working. Later I purchased a new bluetooth dongle and it still didn't work. I called technical support, and they told me that they have not tested it with new bluetooth dongles and that there is nothing they can do about it. So basically i am stuck with this useless product that is supposed to be bluetooth compatible, but only to the ones that IOgear tested. Never going to buy another IOGear product."
1,IOEAR BLUETOOTH PRINT ADAPTER COMBO IS A BUST,"I got it to work with an old HP Deskjet 450 for a couple of print jobs then it quit working. Switched to HP Deskjet D1320, no joy. Don't waist you time and money!"
3,Good coverage but is lacking,"I'm working on a web services project using Java and purchased this book. There wasn't any coverage on web services. I supplimented this title with Java, The Complete Reference that covers web servers. Otherwise, this book is OK"
2,Not effective,"I like swansons products and buy them all the time, but in this case I am comparing it to coral calcium by NOW and the effect on my nails...the swanson brand is no match. I am going back to the NOW coral calcium brand. Sorry swanson you need to improve on the effectiveness of this one."
1,"Smug, Non-Factual","I expected to read a book of the calibre published by Dr. Freeman's American rival, Dr. Silverman. I was horribly dissapointed. This book is short, dry and non-compassionate. There is a particularly smug character to it that I found offensive. Adding to this is contradiction - Dr. Freeman believes there is no such thing as Gifted people, but she writes a book on them. Forgive my confusion. I strongly advise anyone interested in the Gifted to look elsewhere."
1,19th-century mental health advice,"I tried very hard to like this book, and to find positive aspects to it. But in the end, it was only a bizarre self-important book containing theories and ideas obsolescent by degree of generations, I am sad to say, compared to work on the same subject from the other side of the Atlantic.I would endorse this book as a demonstration of how ""not"" to understand the controversial issue of Gifted children."
1,How NOT To Make A Film!,"This is the perfect film to show future filmmakers exactly what NOT to do in every category from acting to directing! It is such an abysmal film that my heart sunk with every spoken word. I was nauseous with pity for every character and person involved with this schlock-fest! My God, what were they thinking??? It is so bad that any wanna-be filmmaker will either get an A+ after watching this or change careers immediately! I'd give away the ending, but I don't remember if there was one!Over-wrought gay ""hunny-bunny"" scenes, violently religious and hateful parents, sterotyped neighbor and plenty of time to get snacks in-between scene(s). It's nearly a one room film shot."
2,Disappointing sound and picture quality,"The story line is reasonable, but you can barely understand a word that the actors are saying because the sound quality is terrible. Often, the background noise or the cheesy music obscures the dialogue.In addition, this movie was obviously shot on videotape (not film) -- the colors, lighting and focus are all poor.Too bad this movie is so poorly done, because many of us have had to deal with similar situations in our coming out process and would probably enjoy seeing a meaningful drama."
1,Awful,"This movie was terrible, you can harldy hear the actors (if you can call them actors)voices when they talk. The sound, video, music were all awful. I know two people who saw this movie and liked it. I guess taste is in the ""eye of the beholder"". Just awful."
1,Truly Awful!,"The most redeeming feature about the movie is that it's short! The movie starts off well, but certainly doesn't deliver on any level."
4,SURE TO BE A CONTEMPORARY CHRISTMAS CLASSIC!!!,"""Visions of Sugarplums"" is a wonderful film with a perfect balance of drama, comedy and realism. It's based on Anthony Bruce's critically acclaimed stageplay of the same title which premiered on the stage of a Palm Springs, California theatre in 1998."
4,SURE TO BE A CONTEMPORARY CHRISTMAS CLASSIC!!!,"""Visions of Sugarplims"" is a wonderful film with a perfect balance of drama, comedy and realism. It's based on Anthony Bruce's critically acclaimed stageplay of the same title which premiered on the stage of a Palm Springs, California theatre in 1998."
4,Simply Fabulous!,This is a sassy Christmas movie that everyone will love. It's about time someone did a movie like this one!
4,Good read ....,"Was not familiar with Russell Andrews. Had not read Gideon - but when I saw this, I knew it would be at the very least a good ""summer read"" - I was more than surprised when I could not put down this book. Russell Andrews kept me in suspense.... A must read for those of us who like ""thrillers"". I have now ordered Gideon....."
2,"Too Long, Too Long, Too Long!","Why do authors nowadays take 540 pages to say what they could have said in 250 (or less)? Maybe it's just me (since I don't like long books), but this one seemed just too drawn out. I bought the book because it sounded good, but it wasn't."
4,"Great story, great characters, eh ending","This was a very different kind of story. It's not your typical mystery, but it is still very suspenseful and well written. I had never ready anything by Russell Andrews before, and I was nicely surprised by his character creation, and his intricacies. I was a little disappointed in the ending - it didn't really fit, and it was kind of thrown together, but it didn't kill the book for me either. It was still worth the read!So, don't expect fireworks at the end, but read it anyway - it's worth it - it's a great rollercoaster ride."
3,Good Story - Too Much Panting,"I read Andrews' Aphrodite and enjoyed it a lot, so I got Icarus. Icarus isn't bad, but it is not nearly as good as Aphrodite. Icarus wastes time with too much heavy panting. Had Andrews taken some of the time he took describing sex with developing some of his charactors, it would have been a much better book. Don't get me wrong, sex ain't bad, but in this case too much of it crowds out stuff the book needs more of.It is ironic that the book named after the goddess of love has less sex than a book named for a guy who flies too high and crashes while trying to escape from an island with his father."
2,Interesting But Implausible,"It's never a good sign if I start another novel while I'm more than halfway through another novel. This unfortunately pertains to Icarus. There's just a little too many soap opera-type twists in the plot to keep my interest. And ""Kid""? Having all these super-gorgeous women willing to kill to have him all to themselves? Not believable either. And calling them throughout the novel by nicknames? Annoying--and I just didn't buy it.Andrews has a nice narrative style, and the hero tracking down all the possible suspects at the end was interesting and compelling. The above items just detracted from an interesting plot. Perhaps the most crucial flaw in the novel is the murderer. When she/he is revealed, it's just not believable that this character could be the one responsible for all the mayhem of the novel. The key to any psychological suspense is credible reasons why the antagonist would engage in such horrific behavior. Icarus is interesting, but it just doesn't work."
4,Spoilers!!,"Why does the suspense factor of this book get skewered by everyone that reads it?? First, the writer of the cover flap gives away nearly every big surprise. Then, so do all the reviewers of this book. The book is a thriller and a highly competant one, it has no real twists though because the shock value is removed before you even get to the acknowledgement page. Pity."
2,A NON-Thriller,What started out as a book with great promise ended with a thud! I had guessed every twist and turn that was supposed to happen.
4,Especially interesting for a Nebraska born person.,I enjoyed these early writings by folks who were there at the time. It verifies some old stories handed down.
4,Great!,"My daughter loves this book. It is small, so it is easy for her to hold and the pages are strong as well. The drawings are very cute and it flows well."
5,My Daughter LOVED this book,"I didn't totally understand why, but the week she made the transition, she asked us to read this book so many times - it wore us out (thankfully her grandma came in town and obliged her). But, she talked about getting hot pink panties like hannah... I guess it really is perfect for little girls and talks about the topic without it being ""in your face"" so to speak... It definitely worked for us!"
3,Don't bother if you already have the boy version,The story is almost identical to the Potty Book for Boys and I'm sorry I wasted the money on this. It would have been nice if they could have a different story and different pictures. If this was the 1st potty training book I bought for a child I would say it's good.
5,Great Book,"Since my 18 mo old daughter was showing so much interest in the potty, I bought this book (along w/ 2 others) for her to 'read' or for me to read to her while we worked on potty training and to famiarlize her with the concept, words, etc. She LOVES this book. It's very colorful, the pages are sturdy(not flimsy like regular paper that is easily torn by small fingers and not as clumsy as a board book) and it has such a cute little story line told in verse that makes it easy for little ones to follow and not get as easily bored. My daughter even sings when she reaches the page where Hannah sings while on the potty!"
1,Last shipment was extremely late to arrive.,Terrible. The book to way too long to arrive. I missed the child's birthday due to late arrival.The Potty Book - For Girls
3,good book and movie for potty training!,"This set is good value for the price for a book and movie, but the book is pretty long and my daughter does not seem to be able to listen to the whole thing. She is only 23 months though, so i think it would be good for an older child."
3,"Great book, bad programming","My daughter (2 yrs.) absolutely loves this book. I really liked it as a way to introduce the potty to her and my only critique is that some of the pictures have the words with the picture and some have the words and pictures on separate Kindle screens. The inconsistency just makes the story hard to follow. I like having the words on the picture page but the type is smaller and harder to read. Otherwise, I am glad to have selected this book."
5,Adorable potty book for girls,"The rhyming words in this book make it especially memorable. My daughter is 25 months and has started to show interest in the potty. We got her this book and after only a few readings (by mommy, daddy, and 2 big sisters), she knows most of the phrases by heart. The other day she was in her high chair getting ready for dinner and said ""I don't need a diaper to get in my way,"" just like in the book.My only criticism is to echo other reviewers when talking about the structure of the book. I love that the pages are thicker than regular pages, but the binding seems to be a bit flimsy in our copy as well. These books tend to be read quite a lot, as any parent of a toddler knows - they love repetition! - so we may have to go buy another copy."
5,She loves it,"This a short and fun potty book. If you're thinking about potty training in the near future, or even if it's further down the road, I definitely suggest this book."
4,Potty training story book for girl,"Overall its a good book, really cute. Helped my daughter understand that using the potty isn't that scary. She really like the little girl Hannah. Cute short little book that I recommend for little girls who are maybe having a little trouble using the potty and need to realize its okay."
4,Love the size and sturdy pages!!!,My daughter is only 15 months. I am a little ahead of schedule but I want to get her used to the potty and interested in it. I am tired of changing diapers!! lol! She really liked it and lets me read it to her. She liked all the colors and it held her attention really well. She can't relate to it just yet but I have no doubts she will enjoy the book as she gets older and can start understanding everything the book says. I also LOVED how the book was small enough for her to carry around and open but also that the pages weren't made of just paper. They are harder and since my daughter gets a little rough with books sometimes it proved to be perfect for us! Good book! I am pleased with the purchase!
4,Great 1st Potty Book,This is a great first potty book. Both my girls have been into the pictures and explanations. I would recommend it.
3,BE CAREFUL WHEN YOU INTRODUCE THIS,"Our 2 year old was quite comfortable using the potty to pee. When a friend recommended this book to us and in order to move to the next stage we bought it. Error on our part. Our daughter who had never had ""an accident"" and knew that she needed to pee in the toilet said that it was okay to pee on the floor as Hannah did.We now skip that page but have to say sadly that we believe this book has pushed us backwards.If your child is already using the toilet occasionally then this book might not be the one for you."
2,Not what I expected,"Although my daughter really likes reading this book, the images are a little confusing. On almost every page Hannah (the main character) seems to leave ""traces"" as she moves. I don't know about other kids, but my little girl thought Hannah was constantly having accidents and that she was OK and happy with that. Needless to say, it was quite a challenge to try to convince her differently, so this book was out."
2,"Helpful, but..","Thank you for a potty book that's long enough to actually fill out a potty training session, and that has good illustrations. My big beef with this book is its atrocious grammar. This book is written and proof-read by someone who has a 7-year old's grasp of the English language. Inexcusable in a book for children."
1,Kindle Edition (for my iPad Kindle app) is in Black and White!!,"I have downloaded many other children's books that were in full color. This book was delivered to my iPad in black and white!! Not many toddlers these days want to sit there and read a black and white picture book (on the ipad). Why would I pay $5 for this? I ""returned"" it and got a refund.Give it to me in color and I would have been perfectly happy!"
5,Cute Potty Book,"This is a very cute potty book. The illustrations are adorable. I'm not sure if it helped in training my daughter, but it was fun to read while she sat on the potty."
2,I judged this book by its cover - and said no,The Potty Book's cover illustration features a child unrolling gobs of toilet paper unnecessarily. I wouldn't dream of promoting this sort of wastefulness as part of my granddaughter's potty training.
5,Great book to help your little one understand the steps to going potty,"Like other potty books, this book begins by introducing the main character and then going into the potty steps in a friendly, easy to understand way for kids. I do recommend this book, it isn't going to magically make your child learn to use the potty, but reading it frequently to your kid will help him/her remember what to do when they feel the need to go potty."
2,I thought it was great at first...,"At first, my 2.5 yr old really loved it. She really DID show an interest in the potty after reading it. I thought, how wonderful..........Well, in the book little Hannah can brush her teeth all by herself...and so my daughter thinks that when you use the potty you also must brush your teeth as well. That is not cool.I love the teeth brushing but not every time she uses they potty!!!! Can you imagine when she's 20 or 30 and still brushing her teeth after using the bathroom each time?? And the book makes no mention of washing your hands after going. So two stars for 'cute' story and giving some interest to my child, but deduct 3 stars for overall crappy (ha ha) story."
3,"Not bad, not great","I have a 20 month old, and this book just doesn't hold her attention as well as others that have more vibrant images. This book wopuld be better suited to an older child."
5,Potty Book,Great book. This is a must for those looking for a book to talk about the process of potty traing to their toddler. My toddler not only loves the book but refers to it often during her potty training.
5,Pity book,We got this book when my granddaughter was attempting to be potty trained. She really did like this book when we read it to her.
3,Kids Like It But Unforgivable Grammar,"My kid likes this book a lot, and we also have the Potty Book for Boys. They are fun and popular. However my complaint is the grammar the books (and associated DVDs) use, including saying things like ""Teddy and me go off to the potty..."" I don't want my child learning to speak incorrectly -- why on earth should a kids' book or DVD use incorrect grammar?"
2,Nothing spectacular,"I was really looking forward to this book and hoped it would help my not yet two year old on her potty training adventure. I tried to make her love the book but she just wasn't very interested, and for a child who LOVES books, that's saying something. It just didn't keep her attention and didn't aid in potty training. Cute idea though"
1,Do not purchase for eReaders,"This book is so poor in format for an eReader that I am recommending you not purchase it in this format at all. The pages don't line up properly. Some pages have black backgrounds, some white, and several don't even wrap properly. The content is ok, but hard to follow because of previous issues noted."
4,Helpful,"My daughter at 2.5 years old is struggling with the whole potty thing. I discovered this book last month after a few unsuccessful tries at getting potty training started. We have been reading it to her every night. Although I actually haven't got a result in our potty yet I think that this book is giving her a great understanding of what going to the potty is all about, not to be scared of accidents (that they happen and it's ok) and she is using all the right words now. It's a cute story with positive reinforcement and one that I don't mind reading over and over again. I'm sure success for us will be just around the corner."
4,A Fun an Useful Book,"This book is a good buy. It is cheerful, uses understanble language and is fun for my daughter to read. The vocabulary is useful for toddlers, and the rhymes keep them interested. This is my favorite of the ""potty"" books, and my daughters too...."
5,The Potty Book - For Girls,This book is very informative and a must for girls in their toilet training years. We found it to be helpful and instructive. It would certainly help a beginner. It takes the task of toilet training and turns it into fun and accomplishment. It would certainly help the little one to understand what is being accomplished. It removes fear from the process and turns it into fun.
4,Why can't a viscount love me?!,"Discovered Julia Quinn when I was 7 months pregnant and an emotional mess. Made the books so much more exciting to be a hormonal disaster. 2 kids later, I still love her books. If romance, especially historical, is something you enjoy, read her!"
5,Great read,This was a great way to spend an afternoon and evening. I just love this author. This family is so fun to read about.
2,Cheesy.. boring dialog..,Very cheesy! This is the type of book where you guess exactly how things are going to play out within the first few chapters. Although entertaining at some points the dialog between characters is very immature and it is attempting to be funny but unfortunately it just comes off as drawn out and extremely cheesy. Nothing exciting happens until the very end of the book.
3,Entertaining,"As with all of Julia Quinn's stories this one had its fair share of humor. I will admit to giggling at certain parts of the story. My problem with this book is it wasn't very romantic in my opinion. I liked both the Hero and Heroine that wasn't the problem, it was just the romance was almost like an afterthought to be squeezed in the last few pages. The lightheartedness was refreshing a nice change from some of the heavier stories out there. But I don't really consider this a romance novel."
4,A good addition to the series...,"I enjoyed reading this second book in the Bridgerton series, but felt it wasn't as good as the first. The plot was fine, but it wasn't as much a page-turner. I didn't feel the love between the hero and heroine as much as in the first book, and the writing seemed more stilted - the descriptions and dialogue didn't seem to flow as well. That said, it was worth the time I spent on it, so I'm rating it as 3.5 to 4 stars, rounded up to a 4."
4,Tested formula,"The second book of the Bridgerton series and it largely retained the style of the first book, The Duke and I. Somehow the men in Julia Quinn's stories were all foolishly refusing love, thus all the pain and anguish, until something snapped to shake some sense to them. It was still a charming read. However, I wish the plot twists could offer more surprises. Both books had similar plots: the men who refused to love, the sensible ladies, the forced marriage as a result of compromising situation, the anguish-filled escape, the near-death panic, the confession and forgiveness, and finally, happily ever after. But I did enjoy the book, which was filled with witty, sweet and sensual moments."
4,Loved it!,I loved this book just like I did all the books in the Bridgerton series by Julia Quinn. A great read!
5,My first book of this series,I actually enjoy this books because I enjoy books dealing with this kind of love story. I am looking forward to reading the other Bridgerton books now.
3,not steamy enough for me,"the characters are very well developed,the conversations are very natural and probable and there is just enough going-ons(i do not like romance novels with too many plots). i like all the characters in the novel,i feel like i personally know them. but i want more tension, sexual tension, i like romance novles that make my heart ache and even though everything else was good i found myself skimming quite a bit."
3,"A little flat, a little boring","I was a little disappointed by the story--it started interestingly, but petered out at the end. The climax was anti-climactic, and both Anthony's and Kate's troubles seem a little fake. The characters were hollow, and the language was too modern-day..."
2,Kinda boring...,"This book seemed very run of the mill romance...boring to say the least. I didn't find much humor in it. And it dragged on with personal character reassessment for pages...I like a little more action and interaction. This book was frustrating. I thought it would be much better after all the great reviews, it was rather like a mary balogh novel, ugh. If you like novels with real humor i'd suggest kinley mcgregor, kresley cole, or jacquie d'alessandro."
1,hated it...,"I really did not like this book. I am amazed at so many reviewers who thought this book was the best ever. It was sooooo formula driven. We have our hero, Anthony, who must marry before he is 39. He thinks he will die at 39, some family thing or another. He decides on the most beautiful girl in the ton, Kate. Kate, though, presents all her possible suitors to her homely, smart older sister, Edwina. Edwina, who rejects Anthony for her sister because he is a rake, ends up marrying him. Oh, they were compromised. Do romance authors feel that must amuse or sooth their readers by making plain women romantic leads? They are always too smart and clever and ""pluky"" for their own good. Why, in reality, would Edwina reject Anthony for her sister? He was the catch of the ton, good-looking, rich, a tad rakish, but every regency is happy to tell the reader that they make the best husbands. It was boring, boring, boring, boring..."
3,Hard to review - (some spoilers),"This was a hard book to review, because at first I was captured and loved the chemistry and budding romance between Anthony and Kate. I love her sass and their little fights, and how she fights to keep him away from her sister. Plus, the romance between Kate and her sister Edwina and her stepmother is great. However, as soon as Kate is stung by the bee (the way Anthony's father died) the plot becomes horribly cheesy, and begins to ruin the wonderful beginning. I wouldn't say it's not worth reading, because overall it was a fun read. But I was sad with the end as the beginning was so good."
3,A disappointment -- it seemed rushed,"""Wow,"" I thought, ""another Julia Quinn so soon!"" I snatched up the book without even peeking inside and I was in a good mood for the rest of my shopping trip.I wasn't as thrilled as I read the book, though. Although the plot was interesting and there were funny scenes, it seemed like the author was in a rush to get the book out. We were told about the wit of the hero and heroine, but their exchanges didn't strike me as particularly witty, and I have laughed out loud at her dialogue in the past.Also, characters kept grinding out their words, sometimes twice in the same paragraph. A little more polishing and I'd have given it four stars."
3,A decent read but as good as I hoped,"Anthony, Viscount Bridgerton has decided that its time to a take a wife and he has set his sights on Miss Edwina Sheffied, but first he will have to get pass her older sister Kate, and is planning to make sure that her sister does not marry a rake like Anthony. But as time goes on, he begins to fall for Kate.""The Viscount who loved me"" is the second book by Julia Quinn in her ""Bridgerton Series"" and I have to say that while the book was okay, its seem to lack the charm of the first book. To me, Anthony really seem all that entertaing and if turth be told, I was glad when I finished the book."
4,I will read this book again,"This was the first book that I read from the Bridgerton serie and I felt in love with this family. After reading The Duke and I, I went back to read this book to get a better picture of the family. Julia Quinn is creative, funny and and develops the characters really well. The heroine is not a shy sweet girl, and is not afraid to speak up or get in trouble. Anthony (the hero) is great. I didn't like that much the explanation about why Kate was so afraid of the storms. I found it repetitive from other stories. Still I think that is a great read."
5,Halloween Math,"This educational math book has a simple approach to help children understand multiplication. The book is so clever. Each chapter is the corresponding multiplcation number. The chapters walk the reader through the concept of multiplication arrays. This enables the reader to visually grasp the concept of multiplication. The book is centered around spooky halloween topics, but is exciting enough for any season. Children will want to reexplore this book often, well after they have learned all their times tables."
2,Too timley to have fun,"My son is 2 1/2 and fell in love with it... When we got home, we had to put it together. Yes, it does take awhile to understand the directions, the tracks don't stay together well, the scenes fall off too easily and the cars race so fast, they jump the track. My son has lost interest in this already. Maybe he is too young, but I too lost interest with trying to keep the track together. It was fun while it lasted. We'll try it in another week."
2,Not worth the trouble or money,"I almost purchased this for a birthday present for my son. But I didn't because of the reviews I had read on Amazon. Instead, his aunt ended up buying this for his birthday, and believe me, READ THESE REVIEWS BEFORE YOU EVEN THINK ABOUT BUYING THIS! It's very touchy. The wire braids on the bottoms of Spongebob and Patrick are very touchy. They have to be positioned a certain way for it to make contact with the track. The track is flimsy and falls apart easily. Don't even bother with the cutouts of Krusty Krab and Spongebob's house and several others--they just keep falling down. Think before you buy this one!"
1,cheap,"My daughters love the fact this race car track was from the theme spongebob sqaure pants, however, what a cheap toy. The cars do not stay on the track, and only one of them works."
4,Better than we thought,This is a great toy. The track does come apart sometimes but is easy to put back together. It did not take that long to assemble and you only have to clean the bottoms of the cars and they will run perfectly. It may not be as good as some other race tracks-but if you like spongebob it is definitely a fun toy to have.
1,The Worst!,This toys just does not work....I just bought it today and I am bringing it back tomorrow. My son is so disappointed. The cars barely move and the one time one of them did it ran right off the track. What a piece of garbage.
3,We Love Spongebob,"My daughter and I have been watching Spongebob since the beginning and we both love him.With that said, we also love the racing set. I have been setting tracks up for many years and know the ins and outs. This track is put together well, if you don't step on it. If you have a toddler that can't keep off the track, I suggest assembling a layout that is not elevated.The cars are a bit fast, but if you wrap a rubber band around the plunger right at the top, it limits the top speed of the car so it won't fall off the track.We rated the 'fun' 3 stars because the track needs to be a bit bigger."
3,Hard for small children,"Although the Spongebob theme is attractive, small children have a hard time keeping the cars on the track. The controller has two speeds: stop and go. If they can manage to keep the button half pressed, the cars will race for hours around the track. Most of the time my kids (ages 4 and 6) sped the cars right off the tracks or jumped tracks causing the other player to control both vehicles. Cute set up! but just not that fun if you spend most of your time resetting the cars on the tracks and adjusting the wire connections!"
3,Spongebob Cheapy Pants,"This was a present for my son, it took me 1 hour to punch out the cheaply made ""scenes"" from the cardboard, and fight with putting the track together. The instructions might as well be none exsistant. You are better off looking at the box to put it together. 10 minutes after I got it together, my son had all the cardboard/paper scenes knocked off, as they are not held on tight. Not to mention the cars/boats are poorly designed and corner like they are in a rut of mud, spinning the tires and not moving. But it is cute. I just wish I would have waited for this to go on sale before paying the [money], it is really only worth around 1/2 that."
1,"A Whole Lot of Frustration, No Fun at all","I bought this toy for my son with a gift card he recieved for his birthday. My son absolutely loves SpongeBob and patiently plays his PS2, Gameboy Advance and other SpongeBob toys with much determination and much patience but after about the 30th or so time the cars came off of the track and he had to put it back on (that is of course when we could actually get the cars to move!), he walked away and told me he didnt like the toy at all."
1,Don't waste your money,"My son received this as a birthday gift for his fourth birthday. After putting it together and getting excited to see the cars go, it was very disappointing to see the cars continue to either fly off the track or not move at all. It was decided that we would return the toy for something more durable. What a disappointment."
2,Just not worth it,"My son recieved this for Christmas. Most of the time the cars simply will not move now because of the poorly built cars. I remember as a child instead of these quickly degrading bits of metal twisted together there were actual metal bands which would make the cars move. The track does go together well, and stayed together for me. But when you first try the cars out they move much to quickly and fly off the track(until the braids wear out and they refuse to move-which takes only a few days). I have yet to find any race tracks these days which are made properly."
1,should be discontinued,very cheaply made and the cars will not stay on the tracks. Couldn't get it to work half the time and so we took it back.
4,Some Good Tracks But Rather Repetetive,I really love some of the tracks from this CD. The 'Wrath of Achilles' is probably the best on the album. It's not how I visualize (or audialize?) Achilles but it does work well. I think of Achilles as hot-blooded and aggressive and at first I was disappointed in this track since it is just a slow steady beat. But it keeps going in a way that can only be described as relentless. It seems a cold sort of anger for Achilles but is such a heartless and focused anger as to offer a rather disturbing vision of the man. I can easily envision him walking slowly through a mass of enemies to this music. 'A Thousand Ships' and 'Hector's Last Battle' are also quite good. The rest are rather hit and miss. Worth it if you can find it. The price on here is reasonable. Despite the rather odd and cheap looking cover this is a professional release in a cardboard case and not a jewel case.
4,John Grimes Cartoons & Illustrations,"Soaring, moving, epic, inspirational. Well done!Suitable as CNN's theme piece for the impeachment trials of George Bush."
2,Don't buy the digital book.,"When this book was digitized, it was not proofed very well. There are many misspelled words causing some frustration as you read. I think I will have to go for the printed book. :("
2,Focus on Results rather than who's pleasing who,"This book revolves around two premises: Good Girls please others, Gutsy Girls please themselves. Whatever happened to focusing on results and what needs to be done at work? An effective person, male or female, doesn't matter which, focuses on the tasks and strategies that advance the business' objectives instead of playing gamesmanship (or in this case, gameswomanship) with others. Ms. White makes it sound so droll to be a ""good girl"" and denigrates her to no end, when in reality she is portraying a doormat straw-woman so that she can contrast with her ""gutsy girl"" persona who doesn't give a hoot about anyone but how she can get ahead and elbow her way to the top. Modern business relies on teamwork and collaboration, and such a self-centered approach will not get the best long term results."
4,Insightful!,"This is a guidebook for working women who believe that they are being held back in the workplace. A glass ceiling for women is not in place because of male management, according to Kate White. Rather, she maintains, women create their own glass ceiling because of their good-girl personalities. In nine steps, she details how a good girl can become a gutsy girl. Gutsy girls break through the glass ceiling and get what they want from the organization. This is an important book for any woman who wants to rise to upper management in a corporation. Men, too, can learn ways to be more aggressive at work. We from getAbstract recommend this book for anyone who wants a strong dose of workplace reality."
5,Unbeatable!,I left university a year ago - reading this book helped me find a job in a field I am passionate about - and further my career by not being afraid to ask for what I want! I have bought a copy for all my female friends.
4,Insightful!,"Ideas and messages spread through human communities in the same way that viruses jump from person to person and group to group. This premise - that social trends saturate populations like contagious epidemics - is an intriguing foundation for a book, and indeed, Malcolm Gladwell's examination of the theme is at times a fascinating read. The book is at its best when applying the epidemic theory to marketing by attempting to identify the key individuals that help transmit a trend, or for that matter, a disease. However, Gladwell never quite succeeds in knitting these observations into a cogent and coherent argument. The book reads like a set of notes - some of which come off as unnecessary digressions. But on the basis of those sections that truly illuminate the cycle of trend dissemination, we from getAbstract recommend this book to marketing, advertising and promotional executives."
2,"Not for ""Every Working Woman""","This book applies to women who are in leadership positions, which I am not, so I despise the title ""Nine Secrets Every Working Woman Must Know"". It's misleading. I'm currently reading this book and have only found a small paragraph that applies to ""every working woman."" Given the title, I thought the book would give helpful tips on getting ahead for the average working woman, but it doesn't. Needless to say, it didn't do me much good for where I am currently in my career."
1,Do not buy,"This is an awful DVD, they tried to make it too conceptual and it failed! it's boring you just see paul booth being ass kissed and there is no actual work ever done. There is nothing interesting about seeing him having a good time with a all these rick bands."
2,Could have been so much more,"Paul Booth is an amazing artist, and this DVD is entertaining but it could have been so much more."
3,American Fan,"While the CD is great, it is missing some songs I wish were on it from the American release."

5,I wish I had this book when I was just starting out,"I have been scrying for over a quarter of a century and yet this book was able to teach me new things about my old craft. The best thing about Mr. Hawk's book is that it contains a complete set of instructions. From selecting a scrying device, to preparing it, to clearing it of past influences, to linking it with your own psychic nature, and (most importantly) to actually scrying, this book is solid gold. It is delightfully free of dogma and the writing is clear and easy to understand. ""Exploring Scrying"" should be in every psychic's bookshelf."
5,Exploring Scrying ... from a novice,"This delightful little book caught my attention...drawn to it perhaps??? Regardless as to the reasons why, I found the material to be entertaining and informative. The author addresses his reading audience in a humorous, well written, to the point manner. He approaches the subject so that the novice can read, absorb the information and not be timid in her/his attempt to begin to learn and understand the ancient art of scrying. One is encouraged to learn what ones skill may be in this area of the metaphysical.I found the presentation easy to read, understand and would recommend this book to anyone so interested. Looking forward to more from this augthor."
2,I could have saved time looking on an online wiki,This book is the basic of the basic. It was filled with lots of breathing exercises and how to's on choosing a crystal ball. At about chapter 7 was when they had a how to section and this was only about a page or two long. I could have saved time just reading this stuff on the web. I was a little disapointed and was hoping for a bit more in the how to part.
2,uuuuuhhh ok.,"This book is ok, thats it. You can do a search on the internet on skrying and come up with the same stuff. IMHO there are much better books out there on the subject. Here is how you skry: 1. Learn how to visualize anything with as much clarity as possible.2. Learn how to project these imaginations outside yourself as if they were seperate objects/beings/energies/etc. 3. When you reach a decent level of this take a solid color object (black/midnight blue/red/green...) 4.Imagine object are on surface. 5. continue to do this while building on your ability to *accurately* view things. 6. SkryIf your serious about skrying there are MUCH better books out there."
5,Beautiful in any language...,I bought this edition of this classic for my newest granddaughter. Her mother is from Mexico and I believe all children should know both their heritages. This book is wonderful no matter what language it is in. I wanted my daughter in law to be able to read stories to the baby in Spanish and English. I intend to give them a copy in English next time so her father can read it to her as well.
5,Lovely story - I strngly recommend it,I have a 5 years old daughter and she already has a picture from this book hanging in her room. When I saw the book I immediately bought it and read it to her the minute it arrived. She absolutely loved it!!!
4,Skate 4 ever,This is a very cool game I would have rated it 5 stars but I played it after underground. And undergound was better but this is still a sweet game. It's coooooooooooooooooooooooool!
4,Great game,"Very cool game, and I'm not a skater. A little frustrating at first, but you'll be doing fine in no time. Recommended."
3,Just a little too much for me and my son,"I'm an old guy; my son is 6. Together, we had so much fun learning and mastering Pro Skater 3 that we couldn't wait to try Pro Skater 4. Unfortunately, as advanced as the game is in terms of graphics and intensity, it's just too much for my son and I to enjoy together. I've tried and tried, using the strategy guide as my source book, but the game is just too difficult to master or enjoy. The game interface is so far beyond what a simple guy like me and my young son can do together. Teenagers may love it, but it's just too much right now."
5,the best skating game ever made!!!,"this has to be the best game this year. i played the demo on Kelly Slaters Pro Surfer, and this game is awesome. its so different from thps3. now you can skitch on cars, bust new tricks, and even talk to people. when you talk to certain people, they will give you an objective. you have a time limit, but it goes away when you finish the challenge. so career mode is like a free skate, but career mode all the same. there is also a pro challenge mode, where you start off as an amateur and as you do more things you become more popular. like i said before, this is going to be the best game ever."
4,Overall good game,"i have just recently gotten the new thps4. I have also played all of the other thps's and own thps2. In comparison with thps2 it is a very different game. they now have a free skate style for career and in the level there are icons that have certain tasks. the levels are bigger, but there are less of them. There is more career goals and they are vary in difficulty. The only downfall that thps4 has is that the graphics for the create a skater is terrible. It is extremely sloppy and you can barely tell what your person looks like. Other than that one little hitch i would recommend it."
5,"Even if you don't like Skating, you will dig this","Just a good all around game. I have never Skateboarded in my life but I ended up playing this while waiting for a friend and loved it. You can create and modify every inch of your player from tatoos to talent, you can climb walls, do a back flip, and land on a car on a skate board. I mean, what else do you want?In the top 3 fun titles for PS2 next to GTA Vice City (the greatest console game ever invented) and Grand Turismo 3."
4,Pretty Fun!,"Tony Hawk Pro Skater 4 is a very fun and interesting game. But THPS4 lacked the magic THPS3 THPS2 and THPS put out in it's game play. First level (which is college) is very easy compared to the next 8 levels ahead. you may get a bit confused as a guy runs up to you at the start and tells you that you have to talk to people to get goals. Talk to people!? Okay... As the level progresses, you will notice as you veiw your goals, that some goals will be locked. Wow. You need to even find the people that give you goals (which may take a while) There are TONS of new tricks and fun things to do in THPS4, such as spine transforing, flat level ticks while manualing and a while lot of new and improved specials. My fav. is the one called.... awww yeah. I'd reccomend renting THPS4 before buying it.It's one of those games where you either love it...... or hate it.Well. . . cheerio."
5,Wow!!!,"This is the best book I've read all year. It surprised me--The Secret Life of Cowboys is a book for anyone who has ever had a dream--of a different job, a different future, a different life--and wondered what it might take to pursue it. The book left me feeling energized to live my life to the fullest, to take a few chances, and to appreciate what I already have. It made me laugh, made me cry in places, and made me think. I recommend this book highly. Everyone should read it."
4,Culture shock,"Armed with not much more than an English degree, Groneberg responds to an ad in, of all places, the literary Utne Reader, for someone to work on a horse ranch in Colorado. Before you can say ""giddyap,"" he's working toward another degree in horses in Montana.There's a girl involved, of course, and you somehow suspect they'll ride happily off into the Western sunset together. But things take a darker turn...Beautiful writing; the effects of Groneberg's English degree show up in the beautiful and poetic language of this surprising and very good book."
3,The Secret Life of Cowboys,"I feel that this book was quite refreshing.I really enjoyed the book in the end, but at first I thought it read somewhat slow. I was very suprised at the way Groneberg pulled me in by displaying such a well written description of his life. Mr. Groneberg is a strong writer who keeps my attention, displays good organization/structure, however he could do a better job of giving definitions on certain ""cowboy"" terms that those from the city may not know or understand. Mr. Groneberg establishes his credibilty in this book by explaining that he has lived and worked on cattle ranches. He does a good job of giving descriptive details, personal experiences and observations, and examples and illustrations. Mr. Groneberg's book is recent and more applicable to this generation of ""wannabe"" cowboys. I enjoyed this book and would recommend it to anyone interested in the cowboy way of life."
1,Not very appealing.,"Once you get started reading, this book appears to be the real thing. Although it may be a true life experience, it becomes very hard to keep your attention and rambles on concerning some big dreams financed by his father's forture, only to become a total failure. To top the story, he must to turn to medication to keep his senses and continue to "" dream "" about being a cowboy. After reading this, I wonder what would have been the true outcome if he didn't have parents to finance his way, and stay away from the mood-altering drugs. Don't waste your money on this one, that is, unless, daddy is paying for it"
2,"Secret Life of One ""Cowboy""","I was really intrigued by this book but after the first section with Tom's working trail rides I had a hard time. Frankly, he went through what many go through trying to re-invent ourselves in a new line of work - a lot of problems. Frankly, I would rather have heard the perspective from some of the old time cowboys who were still able to get it done vs someone trying to get into the life and struggling. I appreciate Tom's candor in realizing that he was not up to par with those that have it in their blood, passed from generation to generation. I guess it is a good thing that at least he stuck with the elements that he was good at and gave up on the areas he struggled with vs moving back east to his old life. I was really looking forward to hearing the ""secret"" part of the life of cowboys - those who do it all."
2,He's not really a cowboy ... but wants to be,"Ok book about privileged young man who wants to be a cowboy. When he gets tired of surviving on his own making meager wages as a ranch hand in a pretty part of Montana, his wealthy father buys him a large ranch in eastern Montana, on the Great Plains. He really doesn't have the background, the grit, to succeed at this. The Great Plains and the life of a rancher who is responsible for the ranch, not just a ranch hand who is really a college-educated guy from suburban Chicago, is too much for him. His writing style is wearying in the constant present tense he writes in, a very flat tone and not lyrical or poetic. He moves back to the pretty and less harsh part of Montana so he can be a part time 'cowboy' and full time writer. His story is not compelling so I am not going to read any more of his writings. Too bad real cowboys don't have wealthy fathers!"
1,Could not finish this book.,"This book had great potential and, judging by the ratings of other posters, is a good read overall. But I couldn't finish it. I know these are facts of life, but I was disturbed to read about the suffocation of the calf and the killing of the deer. Both scenes were too graphic for me."
4,A pretty good system,"The Gamecube was meant for games, not music or DVDs. It focused on games and ONLY on games. This is probably why Gamecube costs less than PS2 or Xbox. People these days are into music and movies. Knowing this, Sony and Microsoft put DVD players and music players in their systems. The games for the Gamecube can be entertaining for a while, but not that long. The games are meant for kids, not adults. Sometimes, adults out there, when you need to take a break from the real world, this sytem will bring you out of it. When comparing the graphics of the next-gen systems, Gamecube comes second, trailing Xbox, but leading PS2. You have to be patient with Gamecube though, for it takes a long time coming out with games. PS2 and Xbox are just rollin' out with games by the month. The graphics are sleek, run-time is good, and the control has a nice layout(it can take a few days to get used to). Overall, this is a pretty good system. Follow my advice (I own the system)."
2,Why bother?,"I had a Playstation 2 then bought a Gamecube. You're much better off just buying a Playstation 2. Any extra games you could play owning a Gamecube don't justify its cost. I wish I had just spent the money on Sly 2, Jak 3, or Ratchet 3. It would have been money better spent. Live and learn."
4,This is the best video game system ever!,"Forget PS2 and Xbox Gamecube is definatly the best system ever. It has the best graphics, games, and features! You can hook it up to another gamecube and play an 8 player game!!!! This system is definatly not just for the younger kids."
1,Broken,"I received my gamecube on time, hooked it up and found out the controller was broken. I go out to buy a new one and when I return, I find that my gamecube can not read any disc."
4,"Game Cube, one of the worst systems ever!","Todays gaming systems are all very good and have good graphics and a lot of games. Wait. I take that back. Not all of the gaming systems are good. If you are thinking about buying a gamecube, I advise you not to buy it! It's one of the worst systems ever! It's a system for little kids! There are a lot of kids games for this system! Example? Super Smash Brothers melee, and Marrio Party 4. What stupid games! There are also very little games out for this system and the graphics are very bad. If you are looking for a good gaming system, you should buy a PS2. (Playstation 2) The games are good and there are a lot of them. The graphics are also very good and it can do more than just play games!"
4,i haet patatoez,"HHHHHHIIIIIIII like the Gamecube but,the games for it are Only pretty good.BBBBBBBBYYYYYYYYEEEEEEEEE"
3,Facts,"I used to own a Game Cube. I thought it was the best and the Xbox sucked, but now i have a PS2 and an Xbox. I think that the Xbox is the best system because its got everything you need.1. 8 gb memory (means no memory cards).2. it does have the best graphics (and yes the Game Cube does have the second best but the games are not good enough for the system).3. a great set of games, it didnt have much to start out but now there are a lot of games.4. Halo.5. the controlers are better (they used to be too big).6.and, I know its cool but, the games are too small for the game cube and get lost."
3,Game Cube,"I'm a gamer, through and through, but I just didn't like this system. It wasn't up to the same par as the other consoles that came out at this time. It doesn't play dvd's and it doesn't have a good game selection, especially not for people my age (19). Eternal Darkness was the best thing for it. I would say just wait until the next big Nintendo console comes out."
4,Quality Game System,This system is pure quality. Here are some of the pros.Pros.Good Grapics. Good Games. MultiplayerTheres only one con..Not as many games as PS2BUY IT!
1,All are great but what is the best?,"All the new consols ore great super, but only one is the best. Lets start with PS2. It got the widest variety of games, less than half are any good. it has the worst graphics of the three. Next is XBOX. it has a built in hard drive 20GB and a costomized Nvidia graphics card and xbox has never used it to even half of its capablity you will see wat i mean when halo2 comes out, only broadband online for faster gameplay onlline and it already has a built in adapter, the tightest first person shooters and sport games. And then there is game cube it is turly great chough chough. it is for two year olds There are only like three good shooters and no good sport games. The only good thing is mario man. You cant even play dvd's or cd's even though xbox and ps2 can. And xbox doesnt need the remote for cd's and you can download songs on the harddrive.So last is Game cube2nd Ps21st XBOXThing of the names Box and cube a card board box is bigger than an ice cube."
1,sad system,"I own 8 different sytems, and my gamecube is the new atari jaguar. Nintendo promised a great system with wonderful games and what we got was a second rate wanna be computer with old n64 rehashed games. The online play for gamecube is a sad joke. Only one game that supports online, pretty lame. Free downloads from XBOX live, chat in every game, less than a minute to get online. The XBOX exclusives are also miles ahead of the lamecube exclusives. Sorry ladies but lamecube suxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.XBOX has proven that the people will not tolerate second rate, pathetic graphics and sound of gamecube. . Poor quality in the games, no third pary support and no online play. Time to put the cube on the shelf next to my jaguar and n64. XBOX rulezzzzzzzzzz."
2,VERY UPSET,"IM DISSAPOINTED IN GAMECUBE. ALL OF THE OLD NINTENDO SYSTEMS HAVE HAD GOOD GAMES THAT HAD MAJOR ACTION AND VIOLENCE. IVE HAD THE GAMECUBE SICE IT HAS BEEN OUT.HERE ARE THE PROS AND CONS ABOUT THIS SYSTEM.PROS- 1)ORIGIAL GAMES LIKE THE MARIO CLASSICS.2)IT IS A SMALL SYSTEM THAT IS LIGHTWEIGHT.3)GREAT CONTROLLER STYLE.CONS- 1)GAMES ARE PATHETIC AND BORING TO TEENS(VERY FEW GOOD GAMES)2)SYSTEM FREEZES UP SOMETIMES OR CAN SCRATCH DISKS.3)MEMORY CARDS CAN NOT HOLD MUCH MEMORY.I WOULD RECOMMEND THE XBOX BECAUSE THE GAME CHOICE HAS GREAT TOPICS. THE GRAPHICS ARE UNBELIEVABLE AND MEMORY IS STORED IN THE XBOX.I HOPE YOU WILL LISTEN TO THIS. DON'T GET ME WRONG, BUT THE GAMECUBE IS A GOOD THING FOR KIDS 10 AND UNDER.FAREWELLAND BY THE WAY, MY NAME ISNT GLORIA, IM A BOY WHOS 14"
4,the cube rox,"i have a gamecube, with super smash bros melee, and turok evolution. i have to say that i like my gamecube alot better than Xbox. the controls are nice, they have few but fun games(with great ones coming out, i hear) and i enjoy it alot. GO NINTENDO!"
5,Gamecube Rox,"Gamecube rocks!I think it is the best system ever.I don't wantan Xbox because it freezes up and overheats.And plus it hastons of cool games like sonic adventure 2 battle,super smash bro."
4,"Great Console, Weak Third Party Game Library","Please know that I love Nintendo, and have owned all of their major systems. GameCube was the first of this generation of systems that I bought (I now own a PS2 and an XBox). I love Nintendo games, so I am happy with it. If I had to choose only one system, this would not be it.Pros:* Nintendo's own games (e.g. Legend of Zelda, Super Smash Bros. Melee, Metroid, Paper Mario) are some of the best in the industry.* The graphics and audio power of this unit are amazing.* The system is very portable, complete with a handle for carrying.* The controller is very ergonomic and easy to use.Cons:* Many major titles have not been brought to GameCube, even if they are on XBox AND PS2.* The system requires that you purchase memory cards, and a hard drive is not available.* Online gaming is not available (I think there might be one game), and is not encouraged by Nintendo."
5,Best M games,Gamecube has the least M games but they have the best M games like ETERNAL DARKNESS which got a 9.4 on Gamespot and has resident evil games only for gamecube GC also has hitman true crime and BMX XXX gamecube is best console
4,great sysyem,"this is the most valuable system.if you go anywere in a car,plane I recomend this You can buy a cable to conect toa gameboy Advance"
5,DUDE! THE BEST THERE IS MAN!,"I have a GC and I love the heck out of it. It is THE best because it focous the ENTIRE system on ACTUAL GAMING! Nintendo has like 200 games for it already so don't say they don't have a big library! The nice thing is the wavebird controler (dude it's wireless!) and it can run for 100 hours on 2 AA bats. Plus you can get it everywhere. sure they have ps2 wireless controlers but only at few stores and it's not sony brand. yes, wavebird is nintendo brand so it says quality! Overall, it's the best thing scence the ATARI came out. GET IT NOW! (P.S. I have an atari so I think I know if it's better or not!)"
5,GAMECUBE ROCKS! (Buy this now!!!),"I got this for Christmas 2003 and i'm tellin' ya, it's worth the buy. I got this along with The Legend of Zelda: Collector's editon and Super Smash Bros. (of course!) and some pretty sweet accessories. A couple of days later I got The Hulk for myGameCube. The GameCube may be small, but it is stuffed with cool features!!!!Whatever game console you buy, just buy the GameCube!!!!!!!!!!!!!Also remember to buy some accessories and games."
5,Grandkids loved the GameCube,The GameCube was received quickly and my 5 & 4 yr old granson's play their games on it daily.
5,Great for young kids...,I bought this for my 6 year old son because it seemed to be a basic system with the largest selection of kid friendly games. Our son really enjoys Star Wars Lego and this console is very simple to set up and use and the small size is nice. One note: I didn't realize that it only comes with one controller. We needed to by an extra one separately so his brother can play with him.
4,GAMECUBE over the rest!!!,Overall Gamecube is the best! When I played Ps2 it was fun but it was only capable of 2 people playing! For x-box it was a good system but the controlers were huge!Also x-box has a lot of shooting games which can be cool but I also want to play good adventure games. Finally I dont know what people are saying but Gamecube is NOT a 'childish' system so at last Gamecube is the overall best!!!!!
3,Great while it lasted...,"My son got the gamecube for Christmas. And LOVES it. But only after a month and a half of use it broke. The screen would freeze and then a message would pop up saying that it could not read the disks. It was too late to return to the store so we had to call Nintendo. They sent us to someone in our area who confirmed it was broke, and sent it back to them. We recieved a ""serviced"" Gamecube back in the mail a few days later. The guy we brought ours to said he's seen a lot have the same problem. I was satisfied with Nintendo getting another one to us quickly. And it was free since it was under warrenty. The problem is after a year if this happens again we will have to pay to get it fixed. Hopefully this problem isn't as common as the guy we took it to said it was.Otherwise the graphics are great, and was by far my son's favorite gift. But for the price of games and for the price of the system I do expect it to last longer then a month and a half or even a year for that matter!"
5,gamecube rules,"i think gamecube rules. im a child of 10/11. all my friends agree. theres nothing like gamecube. here are reasons.1: os2 is really nifty but most people already have a dvd player so that dosnt matter.for my age i feel that the games are pretty over rated. there are a few good games here and there like need for speed hp2 but thats on gamecube too.gamecube looks double as cool.2: x box is an exact copie of ps2, a gigantic thing and has a really anoing controlar.3: THANK GOD FOR GAMECUBE!"
4,"Nintendo Gamecube: Great Games, But Lacks Features","The Gamecube is a good system. It has the best games ever made and it has a cool design. Some of the best games on this system are Animal Crossing, Super Mario Sunshine, and Super Smash Bros. Melee.Unfortunately this console lacks features like online gaming and the ability to play DVD movies and music CD's.Overall: I recommend this console. However if you're looking for a console with lots of features, then get the PS2."
4,A good start to Nintendos new innovation revolution,"Is it odd that the only people who buy nintendo products are ittellectuals and Nintendo Fans. This system is a jump AHEAD of the PS2 and XBOX. The graphics are amazing. The console and game CD are so portible. The Game cube CD is less than half the size of a normal DVD. It has LAN play aswell. Many complain about the controller. Hmm. Maybe you have speant too much time on video gaming to learn how to use a simple controller. Sure it is hard at first but after practice, you'll get it. With innovative new controllers (Bongos and Microphone) for certain games make this a good start to the innovative revolution. It introduced the concept of handhelds(GBA) conecting to consoles(GC). And now the PS3 will steal that idea. You can even play GBA game on you gamecube with a Game boy player. The Gamecube is surely the best so far."
2,"Good Console, Really good games, exept for the worn laser.","The console is in good condition, but the laser of the console was very wear and sometimes in most of the games give me a disk reading error."
2,All failing,"We have 4 Gamecubes and all of them began not to recognize a disc and could no more play a disc after some months. The Gamecube is a very good console IF ITS WORKING. But 4 stations failing out of 4, thats too much. We have no support here and sending to US would be too expensive. But I found a way to fix it and it worked on 3 of them: Open it and adjust the pot to the laser. After that it works again for some time. But its not acceptable that this happens, also because its very complicated to open a Gamecube because of Nintendos stupid way to screw the cube."
5,Nintendo Gamecube=Awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I've had my Gamecube since December 2002,a year after it launched. I had so many great moments playing it. With over 45 titles, I've had a broad range of games. The best would have to be Resident Evil 4, Metroid Prime, and Super Smash Bros. Melee. If you want a cheaper videogame system to own this Christmas, go for Nintendo. I have owned two of them, black and platinum. I never had any trouble with my first system, I just accidentally dropped it. I will have to say the platinum is the more stylish of the three color options. I've been a Nintendo follower since the middle of the SNES era and will always be, but this generation I've left Nintendo for the Xbox 360. While this system is not as graphically capable as some, the strong library of 10/10 Nintendo published games makes up. For $99 bucks you can't go wrong. Spend $150 and purchase the titles mentioned, they are worthy of your money."
5,Graphics,"The graphics are perfecto.There better than the PS2,PSone,N64.But has the same way of the X-BOX and Dreamcast.The bad thing is that you can't play DVD's on it or CD's but has cool accessories Like:>Wierless Controller>Gameboy Player>GBA link to GamecubeAnd More!"
4,Gamecube is DaBomb!,I loved my GCN . It is better than my Xbox and my Playstation 2because they both broke after 2 years . Another reason I love the Gamecube is that they have my favorite game SUper SMash Bros. and Zelda . I also got the Gameboy Player which was great .
5,Best Design Concept for a Videogame console!,"The gamecube definitely is the best concept for what a console should look like. Nintendo has gone the way of apple's imac and designed the gamecube like a piece of art. Also the disc cover pops up instead of sliding out like ps2 and xbox, so you don't have to worry about breaking any fragile disc trays. And no disc tray means minimal moving parts in the system, so it's likely to last longer."
4,very good,"they are a very good system with all of the mario titles plus tony hawk,need for speed,and super smash bros!"
5,Good system,"We bought this unit instead of Microsoft X-Box and Sony PlayStation II because we heard there were more games for 6 1/2 year olds. We have been satisfied with it, no problems. The optional wireless controller didn't work for us, so we got the extension cable and the wire controller. We got one game called Mario Kart Double Dash which is a lot of fun for 6 1/2 year old and adults. We also got another game called Melee which is a boxing match, not suitable for 6 1/2 year old, although some of them like it.....pretty violent."
4,Im sorry,"Ok, seriously gamecube isnt that bad. Its just the fact i own playstation and want to make sure it gets some love. Sry. Real rating: 4 1/2. Since i dont own gamecube the darn controller setup bugs me!"
2,game cube,"One of the plugs used to play this game had been cut off. Had to ""borrow"" the cord from another game cube which means we will have to purchase a new cord somewhere. I feel that this was falsely advertised. I thought we were getting a complete game that could be hooked up and played, which was not the case."
4,the gamecube is a working noob,"I got my gamecube about 3 years ago. It seemed like the best deal on the market.Overall my gamecube has been good, but i've had some problems.1.My gamecube has frozen during gameplay.2.Brand new controllers weren't compatible.3.The system couldn't read gamecube disks.The graphics are the same as the wii,so you don't need to worry about that.Overall, the gamecube is a good system, but can use some adjusting."
4,Where's the memory card?????,I bought this for my daughter and we were both very excited to play our first game. Unfortunately we can't save the game because there is no memory card. I assumed that it came with everything you needed. Every other item I've ever purchased that requires a memory card came with one. Oh well. It's still wonderful to play and the graphics are great. The game we're playing currently is Sponge Bob: Battle For Bikini Bottom and my daughter loves when the controller vibrates when we smash the Tiki's! One question...is it normal for the screen to have lines on it during louder sounds????
4,Quite a incredible system with such good graphics!,Nintendo GC is awesome. It`s a small little cube with incrdible graphics. Get GC...
4,Great system and at this price...WOW!!!,I own an Xbox and have owned every system since atari and this is certainly one of the best. For anybody who already has a dvd player this is the system for you. It is compact and has great graphic capabilities. My Xbox is in the garage now due to the fact this one fits better and I have a dvd player on my home theater system. The only system with Resident Evil Zero and RE4 is coming out. Also with Games like Mario Cart double dash and Star Wars Rogue leader 3 exclusively coming out on the cube...NOW is the time to buy it at a great low price!!!!
4,GAMECUBE IS #1 !!!,GAME CUBE IS DEFINATELY THE BEST GAME CONSOLE FOR YOUR MONEY. IT HAS THE BEST GAMES AND THE BEST CONTROLLERS. IT IS A VERY POWERFUL AND FAST CONSOLE FOR ITS CONVENIENT SIZE AND THE ACCESORIES AVAILABLE FOR GAMECUBE ARE ABSOLUTELY UNBELIEVABLE. THE GRAPHICS ARE GREAT AND ALL IN ALL GAMECUBE IS THE BEST GAME SYSTEM YOUR MONEY CAN BUY !!!!
2,It's not the greatest,"I'm not a 'hardcore' gamer, but I've played and owned many various gaming systems over the years. I bought a Gamecube because I thought the games were worth it. However, I was very disapointed with it. The games weren't that great and the system itself while not horribly slow wasn't as fast as I hoped it would be. If you're looking for a fun system I suggest an xbox or ps2.. even my N64 is more enjoyable! I say it's not worth the money."
3,Gamecube review,"The Gamecube is a great console. One reason is the disks. They were new at the time, and the disks were smaller then a CD. The disks couldn't hold much data unlike the Xbox and Playstation disks, but they took up less space and could be put in your pocket. I disagree with design of the console, though. It's a bit tall, and the handle is usefull sometimes, but prevents you from putting it directly against the wall. The console itself is a bit cheap looking. on the bottom, you can put a Gameboy player, which allows you to play gameboy games on your TV, and is usefull if you don't have your Gameboy. The two memory card ports on the front allow for more storage, which is really helpful when you have alot of games. I think that the way the top pops open for you to put your games is cool, and since the disks are small, the top doesn't have to be so large. Overall, the Gamecube console is nice, and it's design isn't all that bad."
3,alright game system,this game system is not worth the money if you buy it new $100.00if you et it fot around 60-70 dollars that is more like it the games freeze uo all the time and it looks cheap i think if i hadntve bought this already then i would get a ps2 of nothing at all but now i have both of them so ots ok..
2,Was good for a while,when gamecube PS2 and xbox first came out gamecube was the best but recently gamecube has been the worst. their games are horible the last good game was released about the time gamecube was released. and its not just gamecube there isnt any good DS games either PS2 has much better games and thats why Im getting a PS2
2,Was good while it lasted!,"We have been Nintendo fans since the first system, so as fans we bought the GameCube. Here are the pros and cons(we found)Pros: The graphics are really good. The games for the most part are well done and fun to play.Cons: Our system only lasted a few months! Which is a big let down. We had already bought several games. The Cube started freezing, and then it would not read any games. At most we are able to get about 20 mins of play until it freezes or just refuses to read any games.Some of the games could have been longer to make them more challenging.I don't want to discourage anyone from getting a GC, because we really liked it while it was working...but this was expensive for a few months of play. Could have just been a fluke. But we have heard of others having this same problem.May be worth getting an extended warranty if your store offers one, which we wish we would have done NOW!!Sad in Cube land"
4,i like cheese and game cube,"ok first i have to say i like gamecube but i know that it has few problems like the shooting game are terrible, deleting memory is a war that is why ps2 is the only game system that i would choose."
4,Decent product,"Had taken knocks but came as i expected it, is still running and is a pretty good one. Gamecube is a great console, although Wii totally overwrites it."
3,What I think about the gamecube gaming system,"It is in very good shape just like the discription said.Thats a good thing.I havn't been able to use it though,I don't have the connection cables."
4,going to be real cool,"I used to have a GameCube but traded it in for a Playstation 2 which isn't as good as Gamecube but, since the price drop (of fifty dollars) I can probably afford it for that reason and them coming out with a platinum edition is all the more reason to buy it and also the four BIG titles Mario Sunshine, The Legend Of Zelda, The Fox Adventures, and The new Metroid I had a Gamecube before the big games came out and the third color was available but now i somewhat regret it I also reccomend if your also considering a game boy advance and you gaet the platinum gamecube get the platinum game boy advance with the connector wire (Nyko) i hope this has helped :-)"
3,Systems,Its okay if u wanna play mario or cartoon games all dayPS2's graphics dont stinkgc and XBOX arent that much better
1,kiddy junk,"Skip this system if you are over ten years old. Get an XBOX instead. Gamecube has nothing, oh mario 64 rehash, metroid nice but it aint HALO, no dvd, junk online, blurry graphics, simply underpowered and all the game companies are dropping the system to work on XBOX and ps2. Cube is better than ps2 but not as good as XBOX, although I love Rougur Leader"
5,Nintendo GameCube Limited Edition Platinum,This is one of the coolest looking systems around. One weird thing is that the controller plug is black and not platinum.P.S. I rule
1,Regretfully,I was excited when buying this Game Cube to later be dissappointed. First right after we bought it $99.99 amazon lowered the price to $49.99. Then we went to buy games for it to find out it had been discontinued and you can no longer buy new games for it. This game has been replaced by the Nintendo WII.
1,just a box,My daughter was so happy to get this but when we pulled it out of the box it was just that a BOX - No cords etc..
1,Gamecube is for kids!,This systemhas some of the worst titles and graphics of any game systems. The system is perfect for children. I bought it to try and enjoy gaming gaain after years of being out of it. But this ssytem and the titles offered for it are far too juvenile for a guy who is 30 something. Trying XBox next.
1,lamecube blows,"cool looking paper weight but thats all the gamecube is good for. Weak graphics, poor sound, no online play, no dvd player. Buy an XBOX instead."
4,", playstation 2 rocks but nintendo gamecube rocks the world","playstation 2 has better graphics, nintendo gamecube is has more action."
3,"Meh,The system itself is ok","Its just...the lack of games. Im a hardcore RPG fan,and lets face it, the gamecube doesnt have alot of RPG's! Thats why i gave it 3 stars. If you like RPG's,dont buy this sytem. Buy a ps2."
5,so what if it's,"this system is the best! next too super nintendo this thing is great. and about it being this thing you kept calling it ""kiddie"" right? well yes it is but um...VIDEOGAMES WERE MEANT FOR KIDS IN THE FIRST PLACE!!! why do we need games where you cut people in half huh? what's the point in that? nothing!! it's got mario,wario,donkey kong,ninja turtles,super heroes. what more do you need? and i'm glad i don't have to look for a video game for my system and see it's rated mature!! cause i can play something without having nightmares. what's wrong with that? i think ps2 and xbox stink!! (...)"
5,the best next generation consol,"I really enjoy the Gamecube for all the great games that's been released on it recently. Do not listen to some of the fanboys from the other consols that tell you ""Xbox/ps2"" is better because it has a DVD player. When you put into consideration that this system is also the least pricey system, you should have enough money left over to buy the DVD player of your choice. In terms of games, the raw selection comes only second to ps2 (which has been out much longer)- where games like resident evil 2 and METROID Prime, as well as recent exclusive contracts from squarsoft insure a steady flow of quality titles to choose from. Compare that with Halo- the only decent Xbox game out there (which happens to also be the worst selling system) and you would see why during the holiday season, everyone finds the Gamecube so much more attractive."
5,Great Everything!,Everything was included like promise and it works like brand new!!! It even came with a game. Now I have many gamecube games that I can finally play
5,NOT WORTH THE MONEY WII HAS GAMECUBE IN IT,GREAT GAME BUT DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY GO BUY A WII! WII HAS GAME CUBE INSIDE OF IT! SO YOU GET TWO GAMES IN ONE!
2,wow,This product does not bring the video cable for the Tv. It has no controller in the box if you order
3,Minor Problem?!,"Well I did receive the GC and all promised accessories. The console itself is in almost new condition, but the only problem I have is that Controller Port 1 doesn't work. I have had a lot of trouble playing 1 player only games, but multiplayer games will work if controller is in port 2...?"
5,The Best,"All of you people who dont have gamecube, but you do have PS2 and XBOX, trade those systems in and get gamecube. really who cares about dvd, gamecube has the only games that are good. i had xbox but then i started hearing about gamecube and all of its games, so i traded in my xbox for gamecube and got a couple of games. so if you like good games,trade in your other systems for gamecube. and if you want get platinum the color just catches your eyes."
5,This is one of the better systems..,the review from Joey (see more about me) has to be the most bias SOB i have ever read! This system is not just for kids and the games that are out have proved that. Don't be fooled by its looks. The controller has to be the best one out there besides the PSX one... It doesn't need a DVD player cause its made for games..hence its a GAMING system. If you want to watch DVD go buy a DVD PLAYER or one for you PC...Or buy the Q! :DGood system all around and fun for the WHOLE family..not just parts of it..
4,"Gamecube, PS2, Xbox comparison","The gamecube is a good system that has a nice library of games. Some people say that the gamecube is a kiddie system, but that's not true. Although most of the games are not as violent as those on PS2 or Xbox they are still good games. The graphics are just under the PS2. In my opinion PS2 and Gamecube have the best games, Xbox has a lot of action games and I like rpgs. The PS2 has most rpgs, the Gamecube has platformers (mario, Metroid ect.) and some rpgs. Xbox mainly has action as I said before. The system you should really depends on what kind of games you like, althought Gamecube seems most rounded in it's library. Also, the Gamecube really isn't that good online while Xbox dominates there. PS2 has some online capabilities, but they're limited."
4,better than X-box,"Having purchased quite a few gaming systems, I would have to say that Nintendo Gamecube is one of the best. The graphics are phenominal, and the price is great! The compact size, and the ability to easily carry it, makes it extraordinary. Well worth the money."
5,Kids opinion,This toy is the best. It is very durable.Once on adroped down the stars(not on purpose) and only one button broke and if this happens to you hold down the button and lift the lid when you want it to open. Me and my friend play it all the time. It has got a lot of games for you to choose from. It will entertain you for hours. It is very light for you to carry so you can carry it from tv to tv. This is a great toy
4,Fun gaming,"A unique console idea, I truly love Nintendo coming out with each of their consoles every so many years.The gamecube didn't offer the best graphics, but introduced some unique gameplay, and allowed users to even hook up with their game boy advance!The gamecube is a video game console I'll never forget! I loved all of those memories playing Luigi's Mansion, and Pokemon Colosseum."
5,The gamecube is really fun,"I have a xbox360, but I just got a gamecube because I really missed the Nintendo fun ,but I didn't want to shell out 200 bucks for the wii. The gamecube is great because you can get a used one for about 20$ and you can play the newest Zelda and there are a lot gamecube versions of wii games. Even though the graphics are quite as good as the Xbox360 it is better than the playstation 2 by far. So If you just want to play Zelda and Metriod get this and save some money.""(The reviewer was compensated for posting this review.

5,GOOD SYSTEM,Thi is my game cube1. black if you like play station.2.violet oh men you have to be crazy.3.is the perfect one.if you want a game cube buy this color
4,LOOKS COOL BUT HAS ONE BIG DOWN FALL,This is a great system change. It has a cool silver colour and looks good with jet black ( for accessories). I like almost everybody wanted one of these. Then one day one of my friends bought one. It did look amazing. One big problem was he had a little bro. Now he had the gamecube on a low shelf thet his bro could get at. I came over 3 days later and i saw it. The platinum gamecube was covered with scraches. This total changed my mind about my gamrcube colour. In a week i bought my own gamecube and it was jet black. This cube still gets scratched but you cannot see it. So that is why i give the platinum gamecube a 4 out of 5.
4,Minor scuffs and scratches,"When I recieved my Gamcube, it all was there, and in working order. My only complaint is that there seemed to be coffee like stains of the console, but I used fine steel wool, and buffed most of it out."
4,Console in decent condition.,"The console itself works perfectly, but aesthetically the console and controller were dirty. It isn't catastrophic, so I am satisfied."
1,bad,"I know a friend who has been affected by video games. She turned from a nice girl to a very rude and disrespectful girl. All she does is play those awful video games over and over again, and to all who interrupt her, she growls at them, saying ""I AM TRYING TO PLAY THIS GAME!! LEAVE ME ALONE!!"" She once was rude enough to just sit down, play video games, while we were supposed to do something. And I know video games are even worse than TV because they are like the ILOVEYOU virus, replacing valuble stuff in your brain with copies of itself. Plus, they teach you that violence is fun."
2,the stoped system,this system has bade sound. why does it have black and blue it's stoped.well for prople that are 15 they need teen games not e games x box has better sound and other thingshere are some things why you should not buy this game system1 it has bade sound2 it has a lot of e games how about older people who wont m or teen rated games3 it has no gamesi hope this gave you some help
1,???,I would like to rate it if I had it. I placed the order and money was taken from my card. Then I began to look forward to playing but then I just got an email saying that it had been sold. I understand it getting sold before me but if it gets sold then the next person to try to buy it should not get told that they bought it and money taken. I was reimbersed but either Amazon or the seller should not take money from more than one person for one product.
1,STUPID...,"Ya...well i bought this piece of crap from amazon.com and amazon sucks,they don't have any good information... once i bought a car off amazon.com and the engine fell out in the first day and the car was brand spaken NEW..."
1,Only get it if you like the classic nintendo games like Mari,"I Think Gamecube is alright, I only like it because of the cartoonish games like Super Smash Bros and Zelda. Also for the Resident Evil series. On the other hand Game cube is not even close to its potential I think Nintendo could have done better. I think Gamecube isn't competitive to PS2 and Xbox."
4,Shut up!,"Shut up Gary Schultz! We are sick and tired of reading your stupid words! I suppose you hated the NES as well, huh? If you did, then you didn't have any system, because the NES was the only system available! We think you should keep your dumb opinions to yourself, dork! This is the greatest system of all time, for it has the least buttons of all systems."
1,Game cube,"I bought a used product and it came with no cables and memory cards. I thought it was obvious that the cables were essential. My children were in expectation, and now I'm looking for the cables so that maybe one day they can use."
4,Horrible Duribility,"This toy..! I was covering it up with a blanket so my dog wouldn't get it when it just Burst into flames! I rated it 5 for fun because we had a great time roasting marshmallows. It was very educational because it teaches you to not play with fire. I rated it 1 for durability because du it burst into flames. My dog was trying to get it still, even though it was on fire, my dog got lit on fire when she was trying to get it. She luckily wasn't hurt bad because she jumped into our neibor's pool(she's a smart dog). This message is to warn you not to put a blanket over you'r gamecube."
5,hi,i luv toys r us it is so fun and they have good yu-gi-oh cards im planning on buying a gamecube in september(...)
4,Totally Great,This gaming system is a must for anyone who has owned or played N64 and liked it. The color is also very cool and even though it is limeted edition it coes not cost more(it just looks like it does).
5,"People talk 2 much bout PS2 vs Xbox, don't even forget GC","Man all I hear is about PS2 vs Xbox, hey, mybe sum people like me just don't wanna hear about that every time. Don't get me wrong, I have all three systems, but what about the gamecube. The gamecube beats out the Xbox, cuz it's cheaper, and it has more quality titles, like Mario, Zelda, Metroid, and more and some great graphics. Even if some are 4 kids, the games beat out some of those games for the xbox. Nopw 4 da PS2, the gamecube is cheaper and has better technology than the PS2, but the PS2 has sum of my favorite games, like GTA3, FF, Devil may cry, Tekken, and more. I'n my opionion the PS2 and GC are the 2 best systems out there. The Xbox has the best technology and stuff, but the only game I hear about is Halo and Splinter Cell nothin else. All the time, the only game me and my friends play on the Xbox is halo. No system is garbage, cuz every system has thier own games, but if u have $$$ don't hesitategamecube."
5,Amazing,The Gamecube has AMAZING graphics and gameplay. I love the idea of the new platinum edition. I`m getting one!
3,WORKS,"The reason I choose three stars is because the system is in working order, however it brings up visual lines that glide from the bottom to the top the television."
4,Pretty good,"I've had this system for over a year and nothing serious has happened yet. The good thing about the Gamecube is the loading times (especially on Mario Kart). There are 4 controller ports, it's small and even the discs are tiny. The only problem is that you can't listen to music or watch DVD's. But it actually makes sense, because it's called ""Gamecube"", meaning only for games. So far I only own 4 games (Spiderman 2, Zelda Wind Waker, NFSU2 and Mario Kart Double Dash) and that's mainly because I own a XBox and PS2 and I play mostly M rated games. The controller is all right but the PS2 is still better (in my opinion).Overall, this is a system for kids, mainly because of Pokemon and Mario. But I doubt you will have any problems with this system and Nintendo you can trust!"
5,"The best console,it has more games than xbox ps2.","The gamecube has better games than ps2,and xbox where tired of you all trash talcking xbox and ps2 fans. I like ps2,xbox,and nintendo gamecube but I like gamecube better because of it's games and all you kids playing grand theft auto games are messed up in the mind. Parents if your child are playing japanese video games shipped to here are growing well. However if you parents are treating youre kids to nickelodeon ,games ,and cartoons from nickelodeon are messed up in the mind. It even has some resident evil games for adults. The games you should get are: Super Mario sunshine, Mario kart double dash, Mario power tennis,Mario party 6, The legend of zelda wind waker, Mario party 5, Super smash bros. melee, Star fox assault, Mega man games , sonic games too. No nickelodeon games or other ripoffs like disney party."
5,GameCube has the best breeds of games right now,"I have all the major game consoles but I love my GameCube the most, by far. The games -- from Zelda to Mario to Resident Evil -- are just fantastic. Plus you can get a Gameboy Player add-on for $40 (street price) and play Gameboy Advance games on this. I love the Gamecube controller, too. I just have so much more fun on this console on the others. I'll buy the next-gen console from Nintendo when it comes out later this year."
5,gamecube is excellent!!,the graphics are completely good they're not choppy unlike ps2 cause one time i played one.the graphics were choppy and it was hard to maneuver too but i was playing something called sly cooper but it was hard. but the games here aren't too hard i think mario party 7 is excellent and so is all the others but this one has the best graphics and i'm sure revolution will tear the competition to shreds maybe? but this one is still good and on nintendo.com they said it will stay around for a very long time cause they're going to make new games all year long!!!
1,GameCube,This game has no good games for it. The only Ok games are little childs games. I wish I bought PS2 instead because my neighboor down the street has it and it has a lot more titles.
1,Dont buy It!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I bought the gamecube knowing i was going out of country and needed something to play becuz ill be bored. Sadly when i bought it and put it my game and did not read the disc and that happened for all my games. I recommend spending a little more money to buying a gamecube that works
1,Nintendo GameCube the Worst!,"GameCube is the Worst, i have GameCube, PS2, and Xbox.The only good console is Xbox, GameCube stinks, because only have the same games ""Mario Party 4, Mario Party 5, Mario Party 6, Mario Sunshine, Mario Tennis, Mario Tennis 2, Mario Golf, Mario Golf 2, Mario Kart, Mario Paper, Mario Paper 2, Smas Brothers""Mario Mario Mario and more Mario, and not forget the Pokemon games,GameCube only have Kids Games.I need to sell my GameCube -_-,Nintendo is down again wit his Nintendo DS, have Mario Kart DS, Super Mario 64 DS, and more Mario, Mario, Mario."
5,GreatCube,"The GameCube is a great gaming platform. It is small and portable. It may not have the features a PS2 or X-Box have, but the games are much better. The PS2 and X-Box have mostly sports games. The GameCube also has sports games, but it also has games only Nintendo can make. The GCN (Nintendo's Abbriviation for GameGube) has many action/adventure games. The controllers have built in rumble. You can get acessories such as a screen with built-in speakers, a battery pack for portable gaming, and broadband and modem adapters. Also coming in May 2003 is an acessory that attaches to the bottom tha allows you to play any Game Boy (origanal, color, and advance) game on a television screen. If you like Nintendo products or adventure games than the GameCube is for you."
3,Much to be desired,"I believe this game system leaves the consumer feeling a bit disappointed. I have played games for twenty years and honestly i was not impressed with this particular system at all. I don't believe there are enough games/variety for a whole family who plays games. The one thing i do like is that the GameCube games will play on my Wii. Also, one advantage to this game system is you really dont have much waiting (loading) time as you do with the playstations. Overall, i would say this would be an okay game system for a beginner."
4,Classic,"I don't care what you say, this system will always be a classic. It was unfortunately run over by the wii but I will always be a fan. Thank you Nintendo!"
5,Not for Kiddies,"Im sick of people saying it's childish. Is Eternal Darkness childish? I think it would scare the life out of an 8 year old. Is Resident Evil for little kids? Or what about Turok? Is that not rated M too? I'm also sick of people saying Halo is the best game. It is good, but it's not the best ever. There is sooooo much walking around and not doing anything. The best game is on Gamecube: Ocarina of Time. Period. Plus think of the other good games: Ghost Recon, Medal of Honor Frontline, Eternal Darkness, allthe Rsident Evils, Legend o Zelda: Ocarina of Time, Vexx, Metroid Prime, and Super Smash Bros. Melee to name a few. I really like GC and Ps2. Xbox has 2 good games: Splinter Cell, Halo. GC is not a kiddie system."
3,What happened?,"In my opinion, a more advanced system than that of XBOX OR PLAYSTATION 2; however, it's downfall was the lack of interesting titles. It seems Nintendo simply put it out there and then ""forgot"" to make a decent library of games for it. I have lost faith in Nintendo. SuperNintendo was the last great effort that Nintendo made. Now we are onto PS3 and XBox 360, so I would not recommend this system to anyone at this time."
5,"The best console,it has more games than xbox ps2.","The gamecube has better games than ps2,and xbox where tired of you all trash talcking xbox and ps2 fans. I like ps2,xbox,and nintendo gamecube but I like gamecube better because of it's games and all you kids playing grand theft auto games are messed up in the mind. Parents if your child are playing japanese video games shipped to here are growing well. However if you parents are treating youre kids to nickelodeon ,games ,and cartoons from nickelodeon are messed up in the mind. Mario games are a lot of fun so GET IT NOW. it even has resident evil games for grownups."
2,Don't get me wrong I enjoy the gamecube's lineup but a Wii is a better choice to buy,"The Wii can play All gamecube games. You need a memory card and controllers but you will have access to the Wii's great lineup and easily play all gamecube games.I would not buy a GAMECUBE unless you are a die hard collector of some sort. The gamecube console itself has several excellent games such as Zelda Twilight Princess, Metroid Prime, Eternal Darkness to name a few."
5,gamecube,"the game has a lot of fun game like Mariokart double dash, Gaunntlet dark legacy,Metroid priime,Super Smash bros. melee,The legend of Zelda the wind waker,Nicktoon Unite and more.The gamecube is kid friendly.The Gamecube can hook up to the Gameboy advance and the Gameboy advance Sp.Of you has a son you can buy the gamecube It cost 100$ . I like the gamecube."
2,Great Second System,"This is an ideal second system (or travel system) the kids can use and have in the play room. Get an X-Box and get this as a second system. Xbox and Playstation are so far out front its not even funny, but with the price and the fact the kids will leave your main system alone,its worth having in your house!"
3,wishes do come true,"yeah I wished for a Nintendo Gamecube. And I got what I wished for! Too bad it wasn't mint condition. It had light scratches and what seemed like mustard and ketchup stains, I was not enthusiastic about cleaning it:( I thought it was common sense to ship clean items??? Guess my love of pokemon will keep me from holding any grudges lol Its the best legendary video game console ever!!!"
5,gamecube console,I bekieve I have already given my opinion but I will do so again. This item was purchased for a handicaped grea grand son as a reward for working hard at school. I received it in good condition and earlier than what was promissed. I was very pleased with this purchase.Jlafferty
5,GameCube,"I've tried most of the consoles and we love the Gamecube. Performance is very good, and there are many family-oriented game titles available. My kids are 7 and 5 and they absolutely love the GC games. But they're not just for kids. This is the best bargain in console gaming. I am a heavy PC gamer, and I appreciate the GC's simplicity and reliability. In 100's of hours of usage it has frozen up once and no other glitches. Just be sure to get a memory card so you can save your game progress."
5,awesome game,"Great game play with an X-box controller for windows. It had totally acceptable frame rates almost all of the time with my system (athlon x2 4400+, ATI hd3870, 4G ram, Vista). most of the hick-ups where during the ""movie"" scenes which render in glorious detail. The game play itself was seamless, immersible, challenging and had great replay value.Love it."
4,good game,love the fact its on steam......game looks great on a big monitor and will suck you in...worth getting when its only 5 bucks
4,A very fun game!!!,"This product has been met with mixed reviews, but never fear - It's a lot of fun. While there is nothing revolutionary about the game, it is full of fast paced action and excellent graphics. There are a lot of ""bosses"" in the game and they are require a different strategy. The graphics are some of the best to date, even if you don't have DirectX 10. Beware!! It doesn't run well on lower end hardware. If you don't have a fairly quick graphics card (Nvidia 7600GT/ATI X1800 or above) it's unlikely you will be happy."
2,Lost Planet is lost time,"This game was a horror. I had played Assassin's Creed and Gears of War just before getting this and decided that maybe the Xbox Ports weren't so bad after all, than I installed Lost Planet. The Gameplay is uninspired, with run of the mill weapons and a senseless storyline with poor dialog and passable voice acting. The graphics are a joke, I ran Gears full blast on my system and it was beautiful. This game looked like it was an entire generation behind, it barely provided Quake 2 level visuals. Level design was almost interesting because of the grapnel that you carried, but otherwise suffered from the limited graphics and anemic game play.Overall the game was a huge disappointment and once again I will have to consider carefully before I purchase another game ported from a console. I thought we had gotten past that but I guess not."
1,Buy it new,I tried the demo but couldn't get it to install on my pc. I got a copy from my local library to try the full version. You cannot install it until you set up a steam account online. Plus this had been borrowed before. Only one person can have an account associted with a product key. Do not buy a used copy buy a new one or you will have a useless copy. I already contacted steam and they said they could not reset the keys. Buyer Beware. Buy new. I look forward to playing this game. I like what I've seen but not sure if it will be a PC version or get a 360 and its version.
5,THIS SOUNDTRACK HAS THE BEST SONGS!!!,"As a very big fan of Roswell I was very surprised to see that they put out this soundtrack. Its a great CD! Most of the songs are from the third season, maybe a couple are from the second. It even comes with the theme song ""Here with Me"" by Dido. The other songs are from very important parts in the series, parts a true Roswell fan will never forget. I only wish they could have put more great music on there. 12 songs is okay but they had 3 seasons thats like 22 eppisodes each! Just think of all the other great songs we could be listening to. Overall this is a great album with songs from the star-crossed lovers to the alien conflicts. If you like Roswell you're gonna like this just as much. (Please remember that the songs will be changed for the DVDs that are coming out. Season 1 only kept like 4 original songs. Still don't miss out on the original music. Oh, and by the way the second season will be out in October.)"
5,Roswell- A review of this AMAZING Soundtrack,"Honestly, I sware on Alex's dead body that this soundtrack, is the best soundtrack. Trust me, from a true loyal Roswellian, this is the best CD (next to Dido's CD here with me) Anyway you will not be disapointed if you order this CD. Its got Dido, Sense Field, Ivy, Sarah McLachlan, Sheryl Crow, etc. If you loved Roswell, and you were sad to see that it got cancled from UPN, then buying the soundtrack, is the best way to cope. I have prob listend to it about 60 million times because I love it so much. Plus from the CD you can get REALLY cool wallpapers and screen savors. This is definally a must get CD, because if you don't, well you'll just be missing out. So come on Roswellians!! Order your copy of the Roswell Soundtrack, because it is just Soooooooooooooooo..... good!"
3,"Not Really Worth It, Unless You Are A Fan","After seeing the list of tracks for the Roswell Soundtrack, I am rather hesitant in adding it to my CD collection. I have to ask, who selected the songs? None of my favourites have been used, and two versions of Dido's ""Here With Me"" give me the feeling that it was merely created to gain some of the money she has been recievig lately, with her ablum ""No Angel"". Of course on a TV Soundtrack, it is expected to feature the theme song, but surely once is enough. I get the distinct feeling this soundtrack was produced just to pump money out of the fan before cancelling the show."
3,"3 1/2 stars, better than some of the stories were.","I just saw a few episodes of Roswell and always thought it had an odd mix of music, probably because the show seems to have been aimed at the teen market. I haven't tried it yet so I don't know about the enhanced portion of the CD but the music was surprisingly good. Some of the selections have a synthetic beat that I don't care for and others like #8 Travis 'More than us'even have a little of a country sound. #6 Fear by Sarah McLachlan is a mix of some sort, would've been much better with just her singing. Dido did the theme song 'Here with me' #1 was the album version which in edited form was the show theme, #12 was some sort of synthesizer mix which really messed up one of the best songs on the CD."
5,A must have!!,"For any fan of the show, this soundtrack captures the heart and soul of the story line. It incorporates a good mix of music from all three seasons, using some old favorites (Dido, Sarah Maclachlan) with some new, up and coming groups (Travis, Ivy). This show has prompted me to buy a lot of CD's (Fisher, Lifehouse, Travis, Dido), and I wish it could house more tracks to capture more favorites, but the mix presented is excellent, and this is a definite ""must have."""
4,A very good soundtrack !!!!!,"I'm a Roswell's french fan !! I purchased this Cd's because I like ""Roswell"" But now, I also like the soundtrack ... I listen it all the day ... It's not boring !!! On the contrary I like ... You don't be disappointed if you buy it ... Bye And watch Roswell on UPN every Tuesday and think of me ... I will watch the news episodes on september !!!!! Bye Anne-Laure A french fan from Toulouse !!!!!"
4,Roswell soudtrack is good stuff!!!,Well I have just purchased Roswell sountrack and I must say: the songs really can hold the serie mood. All tunes must have been chosen right for th serie and I am really glad for buying it. The only sad thing is maybe the serie is going to end and no more songs are going to be released... :-(
4,Very good album,"I enjoyed listening to this album very much. The main deficiency is that it has only a handful of the songs used in the Roswell TV series. I had expected about twice as many songs as this album has. The quality of the songs is very good. Almost every song is my favorite. I would have liked to have more songs on this CD, because the series had so many good ones. Other than that, this is a very good album."
1,Packaging issue,"The bowl is beautiful -- ordered it as a gift. My issue is not with the product, but with the packaging. It was packed with very little bubble-wrap and arrived shattered. I reported the problem and was promptly sent another bowl, packaged in the same manner, so . . . it arrived shattered also. AMAZINGLY wasteful. Cancelled the order and will buy the gift locally."
1,JUNK,IT SUCKS.. I got this as a gift not 2 days aggo opend it and hooked it up dumb things up arrow is allover. Step left it goes up step back it goes up step right it goes up step no where it goes up. BUT step up it dosnt do JACK. I called ToysRus to EXCHANGE it and they said no recipt no exchange i was pretty upset considering my brother baught this for me while he was up here from out of state. I would suggest do not purchase a gift from ToysRus unless you plan on letting the person know where when and howmuch you paid. I rate ToysRus costumer support in Tacoma Washingtons Tacoma mall branch a negative 100 do not buy this item from there.
3,A good entry level dance pad.,"This dance pad made by Intec is good for people just starting Dance Dance Revolution. It does not slip on basic songs. But beware, this pad tends to slip ALOT while playing the harder songs such as Paranoia or Afronova. If you are a beginner, choose this pad, its cheap and is durable. If you are someone who is looking to find a pad to meet the requirements of harder songs, you will be smart and buy a Red Octane pad.BY THE WAY, please air this mat out first; it smells HORRIBLE, LIKE GASOLINE!!!"
1,Dance Mat waste of monet,"I bought this Dance mat on Saturday by Saturday night after three hours of playing, the mat had began to disfunction, quitting me out of the game unnecessarily. I unzipped and repositioned the mats, for a short time it functioned okay. By Monday after maybe a futher two hours of play the mat was completely disfunctioning and wouldn't let me go through any screens and kept taking me back to the start up screen. I reverted to my old DDR one which despite having a sluggish forward button certainly worked better than this. I have read many reviews on this Intec Mat and have found many to be dissatified with it. Thankfully I had my money returned."
2,sad,"My friend had a party and we played DDR (Dance Dance Revolution) Extreme. It was so much fun I wanted one for my birthday. My parents bought it for me and they gave me two of these mats so I could play with my friends. After a couple of weeks, I noticed the back arrow wasn't working properly. I had to either hit it very soft or very hard. Now the back arrow doesn't even work at all so I have to stick with one mat and not play against people. I would suggest not buying this gift with the risk that one of the arrows won't work."
4,graet ideas for youth Lent programs,"This book has a lot of great ideas for Lent. Ireally liked the Peter's Walk activity, a multi sensory journey with Peter as he meets and folloes Jesus.You can do the whole book over Lent or just pick and choose. It even has pages in the back which can be copied to advertise what events will be going on. It's a good Lent resourse."
2,Middle pole keeps getting jamme into bottom pole,It is made okay but the middle pole keeps getting stuck in the bottom pole and requires pliers to pull it out. Also the bag is poorly made and the mic stand keeps falling out of the bag
5,We used this for geography and the kids never wanted to skip a lesson,"The quickest, easiest way to make a boring subject entertaining is to use coloring pages. Dover knows this and in the process helped my children learn geography. Thank you Dover."
4,Great for homeschool,"My little girls [..]) love to color when I read, and I like the coloring page to be related to topic. The coloring pages help keep them interested in the topic, and stop fights from starting. Dover coloring books really made school easier and more fun for all of us. Best for K - [..]."
4,A good learning support tool,"I bought this for my daughter as she was learning the 50 states and their capitals. She also loves to color and enjoys this book because it has ""unusual"" things to color. A good purchase for the price in my opinion."
4,United States Coloring Book by Winky Adam,"This is an excellent book for teachers to use. A map is shown for each state; with information on capitals, nick names, state mottos, flowers, birds, trees, main rivers and when the state came into the union. Each page also shows where the state is in the U.S. This is a great way for young students to learn about the country where they live."
3,"Cool, but very fragile","This was a purchase for my five year old. She loved it, and still does, but the wings fall off very easily and the legs are fragile."
5,Actually a pretty good toy,"My kids like this little toy and it holds up surprisingly well. Have to be a little careful with those wings, but really, you have to want to hurt it or have a pretty serious accident to damage it. Can be superglued, but you'll have a hard time keeping those wings flapping in that case."
3,"Cute, but very fragile","My daughter loves these things, she has all of the horses and knows them by name. Unfortunately, the wings are VERY fragile and the legs break off. She isn't any more destructive than the average 5 year old, these are just very delicate toys."
5,Great kids book on diversity,Beautiful pictures and simple text to inform kids about diversity. I would recommend this book for teachers and within a 2-6 year age group.
2,Disappointing,"I found this book to be disappointing in two respects: 1) Though the phrase ""different than"" is used frequently in speech, shouldn't it be ""different from"" ? 2) The concept of rainbow friends is a valid one, but concepts are best taught through object lessons or analogies, as in the bookFriendsby Helme Heine,which I shared with my preschool class. I am sorry to say I must return this book."
5,Great addition....,"A great addition to my daughters library. Right now she is noticing differences and voicing them. This book shares the acceptance of our differences....culture, color and handicaps."
2,Delivers a sub-par performance,"This game, while i must say is fun to finally be able to play college baseball, is seriously lacking. First of all the rosters are from last year, as my Florida Gators still have Corsaletti and Tordi manning CF and SS respectively. Also, the graphics are just ok, and the commentary is slim to none. Gordon, on Neb, still is there, despite being drafted #3 overall. Gotta say I expected more from this. The music is not very good. It just seems like EA could have used the real rosters. That along is strong enough to me to rate this game with 2 stars. The only reason its not a 1 is that there is finally a college baseball game for me to spend time with"
1,Terrible,"This game is the worst baseball game I have ever played. The hitting is retarded, the fielding is frustrating, and the computer is too good."
2,??????,"Why have they changed the MVP Baseball Series? I thought the '04 and '05 versions were two of the best, most enjoyable, baseball games I had ever played. I happen to enjoy the MLB players and teams. Now they are replaced with college teams and generic no-name players in only 15 different stadiums? What a rip. It's like the sports video games are in self-destruct mode or something. First the NFL pulls out of the EPSN 2K series, and now this? The best baseball and football games are now effectively gone. Oh well, I was probably wasting too much time playing these games anyway."
1,EA SPORTS messes up BIG TIME!,"where is MVP BASEBALL 2006, major league style. i cant believe they decided to make a college baseball game instead. couldnt they make this AND mvp 2006. i hope next year they do make a mvp 2007, because this year im left without a baseball game. theres no way im getting this, mlb 2k6, or mlb 2006. the baseball video franchise suffered big time this year."
4,Awesome game terrible new features,this game is awesome and very addicting. I hate the new throwing and hitting analog feature but you can turn that off by turning the mode to classic and then it plays like MVP 2005. if you like MVP 2005 and like college baseball get this game you will not regret it i sure dont regret the purchase
4,Pretty Good,"plain and simple: for 20 bucks, this is a great buy.i would have liked the gameplay but with MLB rosters and such but that wont happen with MVP anymore becuase the other companies bought out the rights of the names of the players from EA so they cant use them anymore.very good game overall though.commentaters are very dry and boring, great soundtrack though.pretty much the same gameplay as MVP05, a litle more refined and realisticdefinitely get it"
1,this game is a joke!,"i got this clunker at a game store for $2.99. and that is $2.99 too much. the controls and game play are terrible. any gamer would tell you that. anyone who gives this game a good review is trying to sell their copy here, more than likely. don't get fooled. why EA would release an unplayable game is beyond me. this game sucks! if feel bad for the suckers that paid retail."
1,A turn for the worst,"the mvp baseball series, and EA sports took a turn for the worst, by using college baseball. The mvp series will suck for seven more years, until they get the rights for mlb baseball back."
1,Figure it out for yourself,"I was excited about this game--college fanfare, EA SPORTS, etc. However, mine will soon be up for sale. The pitching and fielding are well done; the batting is horrific. With 3 styles of ""play"" (classic, zone, etc), a little instruction would be nice to accompany the game; however, EA chose to do this on game insert the size of 3x5 card. Tons of pitches land in the strike zone, yet you don't have a snowball's chance in hell of hitting them. The ""load and fire"" asks too much of the average fan; I'm sorely disappointed and will think long and hard before buying EA games again."
4,"Not as good as MVP 2003-2005, but okay","This game is pretty good.Pros:-College game, finally-Good graphics-Okay soundtrack-A ton of teams, lots of local ones-Has features like Create-A-Team/Stadium/PlayerCons-The Load and Fire thing is pretty hard to get.-Only has Dynasty Mode, which I hate so much because there's 120 seasons to play!!-They don't use real players, just made up names-Horrible commentary. The color-commentator says almost nothing.If you can live through those cons, then you'll like this game."
2,"Software is junk, machine is SLOW and LOUD","I just want to save someone the headaches I've had since I bought this machine three months ago... I've had nothing but problems with software glitches since I installed this machine, I've had to uninstall and re-install three times, including spending an hour on the phone with customer support (who was great, and why this thing got two stars!) and even beyond that, this is the slowest, loudest printer/copier/scanner I've ever had. I thought this was sort of a 'higher end of the lower end' of all-in-one units, but this thing isn't worth much...sure wish I had my Epson still!!"
1,wait for the next version,"when they fix the following problems:1) printing full page photos the HP PHOTO PAPER slips in the rollers and loses several lines at the very bottom of the page. Wait until they figure out how to engineer rollers (and you'd think HP would know this by now).2) under Vista, if you network the printer it will acquire an IP address via DHCP. When you install the driver it finds the printer at that address. So far so good. Now, unplug the printer and plug it back in. It acquires a new (and very likely different) IP address. Think the driver knows that? No! You get that ever help Microsoft style error message, ""Error Printing"". Wait until HP discovers what the DYNAMIC in DHCP means, then maybe.In all fairness the printer is still better than an Epson and the print quality is very good."
2,Good printer until black stops printing,"WARNING: CHECK THE FORUMS AND GOOGLE (or your preferred search engine) !! There are a ton of complaints out there about the Black ink printing stopping, and there seems to be NO fix (unless the head needs cleaning . . . but that is almost never the problem).Once the black stops printing, hopefully the printer will still be under warranty, and HP may replace it. Otherwise, it is good for holding doors open, but that's about it. I no longer buy HP because of this problem. I should note that others in my family have had some good results with other models, but my C5180 was only good until it was about 6 months out of warranty."
2,Great photo quality. Paper feed is TERRIBLE.,"This thing just won't take paper from the tray. Doesn't matter what kind of paper -- presentation, photo, regular. It can't pick the paper up and gives me a ""printer out of paper"" message. I have even tried feeding it by hand but no go. It's gotten to the point where I can't use the printer, and it's 4 months old."
5,"Great machine, but a little noisy","Speed and quality on scanning, printing, and copying is great, but it is a bit noisy when scanning. Printed a 4x6 from a 5x7, and it was perfect."
4,"Excellent all-in-one printer, scanner, copier","The Photosmart C5180 has every feature that I would ever need in an all-in-one device. For the price, it's an excellent buy. If there was anything that I didn't like (and this is a nit), it frequently goes into a processing mode (not sure what it's doing or cleaning or calibrating). However, it doesn't take that long. In summary, easy to use (in all modes), good quality, and good price."
4,"HP Photosmart C5180 All-in-One Printer, Scanner, Copier",The HP C5180 was easy to install and it is simple to use. This item does not require technical knowledge to use or install.
2,Not so good with Vista,"I had high hopes for this. Good build quality. Seemed like all I'd need for fun and for my home office.The thing never played all that well with Vista. It would often disappear from our network, which made it hard to print from our other computers.The photo tray was crap. I had to give it english every time to get it to work correctly. The last time, unfortunately, I gave it too much and smashed the glass in the scanner.The photo printed, finally, but now I'm shopping for a new printer.If you're impatient like me, and you expect a fairly expensive printer to work well out of the box, skip this one.I will say, however, that contrary to others' experiences, the scanner was the one thing that worked consistently well for me. That software was easy to use, and I got a lot of compliments on the scans I made with it.If only the rest of the functions had been as good!"
1,Do NOT purchase a C5180,"This HP C5180 is the slowest, noisiest, constantly ""cycling"" piece of-----anyone has ever introduced on the market! As soon as you get it operable, you realize that had you been able to see one in actual operation in the store, you'd NEVER consider buying this sort of crap!"
1,"Don't buy this printer, too many problems","I bought this printer at a local store because it came as a packaged deal with my computer. I actually bought a slightly different model, but I had to send that back to HP because it was defective. After spending hours on the phone with tech. support they nicely sent me a new one. That one was defective too. So after hours again with tech. support they sent me another.I've had this model for about 1 year now. It prints okay (besides sounding like it's working really hard to do it), but I won't print photos on it because it uses too much ink. I make sure to print everything without color, and it still somehow uses color ink. I have to constantly replace the ink cartridges and if not it won't print at all- so if I'm out of cyan it won't print black and white! I have a friend who also has had many problems with the HP all-in-one printer. I would recommend a basic printer (Cannon or Lexmark) over this one."
1,Will never buy HP again,"I have two computers, a Toshiba laptop and a high quality custom tower computer with Windows XP.. This all-in-one software never was able to scan to my desktop computer. After MONTHS of dealing with HP customer (non)service, I have given up and will never buy HP again. I even bought a new software CD on their suggestion - no results. Also, even though it is barely getting used, the ink cartridges need replacing quite often. I suggest you look elsewhere for a good all-in-one. Mine is flying off the balcony quite soon."
2,no scan ability for vista,"Printing works fine with Vista but if you need to scan then look elsewhere, not worth spending your time trying to figure it out, HP is unwilling/incompetent of offering troubeshooting help."
2,Broke down 2 days after 8 month warranty ended.,"I am looking at a paperweight I paid $299 for. After 45 minutes and five customer service agents, one of whom transferred me to an outside hotel reservations line, HP suggested I ""upgrade."" I will, but never with another Hewlett Packard product. Anything but that. (shudder)"
2,not very good,"Was looking forward to getting this all in one printer but very dissappointed so far. Very, very slow reaction time for printing or copying. Takes way to long to start the printing or copying process even after it has been on and warmed up for a while."
4,It's great,"This printer is great! Spits out 4x6 color photos in about 25 seconds that are top notch. The color screen makes it a snap to choose photos to print out without having to connect to a computer. Of course it's WAY cheaper to have your prints done at the store than at home but this makes pictures just as good as the store. Really like the 2 paper tray system that you can put in 8.5x11 and 4x6 photo paper and not have to switch.Works with my powerbook great and I have it hooked up through my wireless router so I can print from anywhere in the house. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because I wish it had a fax built in. It would be a 5 easily then. On a side note, it's a pretty big printer so have lots of desk space available."
1,"HP means ""HELP PLEASE""","we bought this printer at best buy about 5 years ago. it is junk, and has been junk ever since it was brand new. every time we try to use it the only way we can get it to work is to unplug it and plug it back in. it also shows empty cartridges when they are not even near empty. very inconvienient at best. i will never buy another HP printer of any model."
1,I have had nothing but problems with this printer,"I have had this printer for about two years, and I am about to junk it.Here are some of the problems I've had:- Almost every time I turn on the printer the drivers re-install. Then my computer shows another printer selection available (Copy 1, Copy 2, etc). This has happened with two different HP computers.- If any one of the color ink cartridges is empty, the printer will refuse to print anything, even black only.- If any one of the ink cartridges is ""expired"" (still plenty of ink in it!) -- the printer refuses to print.- Yesterday I replaced all of the ink cartridges (one or more were ""expired"") to print some photos. All brand new original HP ink cartridges, and my printer is telling me that one of the cartridges must be replaced soon because the ink level is almost out of ink.- And now the printer says I am out of photo paper, although it is loaded with photo paper. Can't get it to print a photo.Bye-bye HP printer!"
2,"Good, if you can get it to print","After my reliable HP930C and 27,000 copies later died in a stupid accident I decided to go with an all-in-one. As I was very happy with HP I decided to go for this 5180C.All I got was frustration. If you can get it to print, print quality is good and fast, but this printer is always busy with something else; powering up, cleaning, mainteance, head-aligning,...What I like about it:- Good print quality- 6 inks for better photo quality- Networking- Nice set of featuresWhat I don't like about it:- The printer is never ready to print; if you want to print it has to go through cleaning cycle, aligning cycle- It's always doing something else- Bloated software- Doesn't want to print black and white when one of the colour cartridges runs out- Always shuts down for no apparent reason and there is no way to wake it up again. The only way is to unplug it and plug in again and there goes the cleaning cycle again...I got so frustrated with it that I was happy to see it dumped."
1,Not real happy!!!,"I have had this item for a couple years now. I rarely used it because I had another printer in the home to use. I also never used it too much because it would always say I was low on ink. So, I decided maybe they were drying out and I decided to buy new cartridges and start using it. I put in 2 new color cartridges. After printing out 3-4 TEXT ONLY pages, my new ink was already down to 80% left. So, either it does not work well, or it is an INK HOG. Too much money on ink if this keeps up. I'm not so sure I like the individual inks!"
3,not completely vista ready,this is a fine all-in-one but it is not totally compatible with vista. when i loaded the software i got a critical error and it didn't load the affected part. you can't save photos on a memory card to the computer. i tried to find a fix for this but didn't. it will do it with no problem to my other computers that are running xp. i have it as a network printer off a router not usb connected
4,Software not great,"I like the printer, it was sent by slow mail but was here in only three days.I am happy with it, I like that the buttons are on front so I can have it on a shelf and not have to get over the top of it to see what I am doing.The software is not so good. I would like to reinstall my software from my old HP printer, I could almost use it with my eyes closed. I may try to dump this new stuff and reinstall the old.Amazon is great to o business with, they have everything!Rita"
3,so-so PSC,"I have had good experiences with other hp PSC products so I thought this would be a good next step. It does have a large display with menu but it often is not clear how to accomplish what you want. I've wasted a lot of photo paper because I couldn't tell which paper tray it was going to use (letter or photo). It also spends an extraordinary amount of time doing ""maintenance."" I was better off with my HP PSC 2175."
4,printer,"The quality of the print is good, but the printer is loud and does shake a lot in the process."
1,"Problems, problems, problems","I'm guessing HP thinks they make useful, high-quality, valuable products.I don't like my two-year-old C5180 All-in-One printer (or the HP computer it came with) and would like to sell it back to them.If someone from HP sees this, would you please make an offer? I'd be interested to know what YOU think it's worth.If I don't hear anything, I'm throwing it out."
1,Sloowwwww on my Mac,"I have done everything HP claims will fix this problem and it still prints one in 3 documents so slow that it is useless. It will take 5 minutes to print a 5 page document. Usually if I delete the print job and restart it the print speed will go. Perhaps it is Leopard or some quirk of my computer. This is the first HP printer I have ever had real problems with.The print quality is good. I can barely tell the difference between fast draft and high quality text only print jobs. The OCR and scanning is so-so. For the price it is OK for pictures and graphics but scanning text is next to impossible. 1 in ten letters seems to be off.This printer seems to run great when I print with my PC so my sense is the problem has to do with working with Macs although someone here claims theirs works great. I am donating it to a non-profit (that uses PCs) and buying a different printer.HP customer service was great as usual, even if they could not fix the problem."
2,Not Useful as a Scanner,"The scan function of this device is truly disappointing. It has especially terrible output from magazine pages. I was unable to fix this with any adjustments. I tried VueScan, which helped, but not enough. I returned it. My good old Epson 2580 gives much better quality output. I think I'll just buy a print-only printer and stick to dedicated scanners. It seems that most of the positive reviews here focus on the printing functions and output, with little interest in the scanning. This device proves the old saying ""jack-of-all-trades and master-of-none."""
3,c5180 printer review,"Printer works fine. Easy to install across a home network. However, the software that drives the printer seems to be full of bugs. The printer driver causes the computer to continuously check the network connection, using up computer resources; and the printer driver causes windows xp shut down routine to hang up, with an error given as ""windows is trying to close xxxhp program, program not responding"". These bugs are just irritating and do not seem to effect the performance of the printer. Hp should have done a better job with the software."
2,Careful...it won't last.,This was a good printer...while it worked. I've had it for some time but it got very little use. In the last week I got an error code that it could not recover from. I searched the web and found a couple of suggested fixes...but none worked.If you're looking for a printer that will only work for a short time...this is your printer.If you want something that will be dependable over the long haul...I'd suggest something else.Good luck.
2,money sucking printer,"Made in Malaysia. Bad issues with ink. When any one of the six (1 black, 5 colors) individual ink cartridges ran out of ink or was date stamped expired, the machine would not continue to function. I had to replace the cartridge. If I only wanted to use the black ink by itself, it would not work. After a while, I got all sorts of lines imprinted across the page. I refuse to buy any more of these money sucking printers. I will simply spend the money at a print shop. Cost of machine plus ink not worth it for the convenience."
2,junk,"had this for 1.5 yrs. used it like 7 times. now gettin error message that has to be serviced by hp, etc. Junk, now stuck with brand new ink b/c print head error so i'm thinking low ink, etc. bringing it to the desert and shoot it to pieces."
1,I will never purchase an HP product,"I bought the HP C5180 printer and experienced problems from the very beginning. This required me to spend countless hours on the phone with customer support. After wasting more than 6 hours of my time, I finally had a new printer sent to me. This took about a week to come, only to find out that this printer did not work either. I am still waiting on HP to send me yet another printer. For some reason, the first printer they sent me was a refurbished one when I paid for a brand new one. It took them two days to send me the first printer I ordered, but over a week to send me a replacement. I will never buy another HP product again. Not only are their products junk, but their customer support is ridiculous. If I have a problem with a product, the company should do everything they can to help me. HP takes their good old time in resolving the situation."
1,Ink Pig,"Ravenous with ink. Requires no less than SIX ink cartridges, which seem to run out immediately. Will not run when it thinks its out of ink, even when its printing fine. Prints very slowly. A fussy old woman of a printer. If you're looking for a straight-forward, can-do printer, stay away from this prima-donna."
1,Photo paper jammed each time,"I just purchased this printer two weeks ago based on the good reviews but I'm afraid it has not met my expectations. It will be going in the return box tomorrow. Each time I print photos on photo quality paper, the paper jams in the printer. My old printer was an HP but never ate ALL my paper. When I pull out the jammed paper from the back and shut the printer down to clear it out, it says to hit the okay button to start it going again, but nothing happens. I have to turn it off and on for it to start again. I have spent too much time on this printer and it's time to go! Perhaps this printer is defective?Also, when installing the software, I had problems with the installation. I had to call HP technical support twice. The first HP rep did not give me good advice. I spent a very long time with the other HP rep who was more helpful. My previous HP printer software was the culprit and had to be manually deleted so that the newer software could be installed."
1,Worst Printer Ever,"My family has been a huge HP printer fans, not so much on their computers (poor hardware esp. in the hard drives). Anyways, I received this printer as a college gift for starting in on engineering. I have had nothing but issues with this printer from the get go. I just assumed that it would get better and that I would get used to it's loud noises and it's slow thinking and spooling. There is something always going wrong, it can't connect to the pc or it thinks there is no ink in the cartridges but there is. When I replace the cartridges it says they are only half full. This was an expensive printer and for it to give me this many problems is frustrating. Apparently HP thinks they can get by with poor quality. It's pretty bad when engineers, multiple engineers can't figure out what is going wrong with it. On a final note, I looked up online help for these issues, and it's pretty common for these issues to arise. So keep that in mind before you purchase this printer."
2,finicky printer,"This photoprinter is the finickiest printer we've had. It is slow to warm up and very noisy. The fast draft option practically spits the paper out at you! It is just an overall quirky printer and doesn't always behave the way we want it to! If we want to print on regular 8x11 paper, it may or may not want to print. Wish we could return this one for a different printer."
1,photostupid,"I've just spent 2 days of frustration trying to get this machine to scan a document and save it to my Mac. I've been through the mill with the HP ""support"" and have got absolutely nowhere. i am trying to get it to work on a Mac over a network, which may be the challenge, but surely not an impossible task. I fear it might be. I don't have this problem with my Epson..."
1,A disappointment,"If you use it to print three-part perforated checks and aren't using a full 3-check sheet, forget it. It has only one take-up roller, offset to one side, so is unbalanced. Any paper shorter than 11"" becomes skewed. Won't take anything wider than 8-1/2"". Very touchy about paper intake. Does nice photos, tho'. Scanner so-so."
4,Not bad...,"Only two things I could really ding HP for on this one.1.) The Photo printer prints better directly from the Cameras' memory cards than from the computer files sent as a print command via various photo software or applications (even HP's own)...2.) Don't fall for the HP Photo Value Pack (Photo paper & six ink cartridges) the ink cartridges are half full (which allows them to sell it at that price...)I also hear a lot of people whining about buying this product expecting it to have fax capabilities, also. (Please Note. It says ""Printer, Scanner, Copier."") It's a PSC. Not what some, now, consider a true ""All-in-One."""
5,Frothy Perfection!,"I love this little gadget! First, I love the results. Pour milk into the pitcher -- heat on the stove -- (unless you want cold froth--and I often do) -- pump the handle up and down 20-25 times -- wait a minute -- and lift out the thick and fluffy frothed milk. Second, I love the fact that there's no electricity involved. With my little Bialetti Moka Express and this gem, I could make cappuccino on a campfire! AND, as living overseas has meant that all of my electrical gadgets have to be run through a transformer, I really appreciate the fact that there's no plug! Also, considering that the price of this milk frother is what you'd spend in less than 2weeks with a Starbuck's habit, it's a great value!"
3,Nice froth without electricity,Easily makes a nice creamy froth for a reasonable price. I would give it a higher rating if the metal was thicker on the bottom. Milk scorches easily and makes this pot tough to clean if you don't keep a close eye on it while heating.
2,Reading light will not work after less than a month.,"I really liked the price. I bought this for the reading light option and loved it, till the reading light stopped working. I tried a new bulb, no luck. So I took it apart to see if there was a loose connection inside, but no luck there either. Mine could just be a one of those that it just happened to. I did not take the chance again, bought a different kind somewhere else.Really wanted this to work and t may work for you. I threw away all the paperwork, so I can't send it back."
3,Nice Lamp,"There is no overhead lighting in my very large living room and this lamp provided very good light for the room. My only problem was the fact that the product I received was obviously a returned product. I didn't realize it at first because it was repackaged very well. However, when I connected the final piece, I noticed that a piece of the outer casing of the bulb socket was missing (and it was not in the box). The inner mechanism was fine.Despite my disappointment, I chose to keep the lamp and will replace the bulb socket. I felt it was cheaper to do that than to pay for shipping back the giant box."
1,No,"I've owned this lamp for a year and a half now, and it is starting to fall apart. The lamp claims to handle 2 150w light bulbs (which I never used), but even with 100w bulbs, the shade has become brittle in some places. Just this morning I went to change a light bulb, and a large section of plastic just crumbled, leaving a large hole in the shade. The reading lamp also no longer works.I really loved this lamp when I first got it, it was bright, the gooseneck lamp was really handy, and I liked the style. After owning it for some time though, my advice is to stay away."
3,"Not bad, but exercise caution.....","I have two of these lamps, one of which is conveniently placed behind the sofa with the smaller light perfectly situated to give me bright light when I'm sitting and doing needlework. The lamps are attractive and practical. A word of caution, however: do NOT use bulbs larger than 100 watts in the upper shade. We put in 150-watt bulbs at first, and some time later we were dismayed to see that burn holes were appearing in the plastic shade. Eventually we wrote to the company to order replacement shades. I think this would happen eventually even with 100-watt bulbs; it seems to be happening again. We may replace one of the lamps soon because the reading lamp has stopped working; I think this time we may splurge for a lamp with glass shades which will not become damaged due to the heat of the bulbs."
3,ok but not great,"i got this lamp from the ""today's deal"". it works fine but i wish it has a separate switch for the small light. now turn it once, turn on the big light, 2nd time turn off the big light and turn on the small light, 3rd time turn both on, 4th time turn them all off, in that sequence. if you want to just turn on the small light sorry you will have to go through the sequence."
1,"Can't rate lamp, as INTERIOR box was damaged","the lamp was inside a damaged box, that was rebox into a brand new amazon shipping box. as soon as i opened the amazon box, it was obvious how damaged the box inside was, as it appears it was totally smushed prior to being reboxed... the styrofoam inside the lamp box was broken and shifted and b/c of that, it changed the shape of the box b/c the contents were loose, and no longer protected in the styrofoam. the shade was bent, as was the area where the lightbulbs get screwed in. could have been a fire hazard if i used it. I've never seen anything like this from Amazon and as a prime member, i ordered something at least twice a week. So disappointed that an amazon warehouse allowed this to be shipped to a customer. i hope it is not a sign of things to come for amazon."
1,The worst timer in the world!,This thing doesn't work. You have to shake it to get it started and at the end of the period...no ding...just dies. Worthless.
1,i don't understand why the others say this is so satisfactory...,"The Good:*...well it does come with ONE cassette for a mother book at least, so...The Bad:*too little is recorded on a single tape*everything is rushed with many grammar notes, and long lists of vocabulary(and again, they dont record a lot of it either)*no conversations at all. It's like a boring, old school foreign language class textbook.I was excited to learn this at first, but this book changed everything. Don't waste your time or money on this.The Lady Getter"
4,"Very useful & well-organized ""starter"" book for travellers","Clive Holes has produced a well-organized and very useful ""starter"" reference for developing a learner's basic-but-necessary skills in the Gulf Arabic dialect and its related cultural settings. The paperback presents realistic and convenient dialogues for many of the typical social and professional situations that a visiting tourist or businessperson might encounter. The reader can develop listening and speaking skills by using the optional supporting audiocassete tape which reinforces the text. One of the best references available for self-study of a major regional dialect of the Arabic language. Another commendable result of the author's years of academic and impressive on-the-ground research in the region's languages, dialects and cultures."
2,Lacks answers,"I am just beginning to learn programming. This book starts out well with easy tutorials that you work through, and then gives exercises at the end of each tutorial. The only problem is that there are no answers to the exercises, so if you get stuck or just want to check your solutions, you are SOL. So, if you are a beginner like me, the book is worthless."
3,"For a book so heavy to carry, it only scratches the surface","The Deitel & Deitel books are very colorful and very heavy to carry in your backpack.They do have a lot of material in them, but the material basically going into excrutiating detail about each subject with tons and tons of code snippets and complete code examples. If you like details, then this book is for you.Unfortunately, while the size of the book is big, the range of topics is limited. ADO.NET, OOP, .NET Framework concepts are glossed over. OK, you can buy other books to supplement this one and the book may make a good textbook for a first semeter college course (in a multi-semester, multi-course program). All the same, for such a high price and a heavy carrying weight, I wish more topics were covered."
1,Stick with the early ones,"I loved the early Amanda Cross books, literate, witty and well written. Unfortunately the last few have become little more than a platform for proclaiming a constant conspiracy against feminism and feminists.I bought this book and opened it with great enthusiasm but as soon as I began to read it, I remembered that I had decided against buying or reading any more Kate Fansler books.I heartily recommend the earlier books but this one is very disappointing."
4,a fun book,"This is good light reading Maybe you have to sympathize with liberal, feminist political beliefs to like this book and maybe not. The author has been a distinguished professor of literature at Columbia University for many years, so the academic setting, one assumes, is rendered authentically. I liked the fallible, intelligent protagonist Kate Fansler. The conclusion wasn't anticlimactic as I found so many mystery novel's endings are, maybe because my hopes weren't too high for the plot of the book. I assume that Leslie, Harriet and Reed are regular characters in Cross's novels. I'll read another book by this author someday"
1,"Trite, cliched and tedious","It was a struggle to read ""The Puzzled Heart."" The plot lacked substance and surprise and it was too easy to guess the culprit. The constant dribble about the evil ""right-wing"" made this book especially tedious as it was trite, offering little more than generalized preaching. Obviously, this novel is more of a forum for the author to espouse her shining liberalism than it is a mystery, well-crafted or otherwise.If I recall correctly from reading earlier works, the characters did not resort to using expletives and a few were thrown in for a reason I cannot fathom; especially because they did not fit with the usual dialogue. I found it distracting and gave me reason to believe the author has become sloppy with her writing.The only thing enjoyable about this book is the constant flow of single malt Scotch. Perhaps I would have found the book a better read if I had imbibed."
2,Not Her Best,"Amanda Cross usually writes excellent mysteries, but this one is not very good. The plot is contrived, and all the political views expressed are annoying. The only redeeming quality is the cast of characters."
1,Boring and cliched,"An unbelievable plot and frequent political lectures don't make for engrossing reading. The investigation into the kidnapping is ludicrously linear - think of a motive, investigate, reject. In the meantime, no one thinks to call in the police. The private detective's idea of a clever ""cover"" is adopting a St. Bernard. This is pure drivel, and I can't believe the NY Times, of all papers, gave this book a good review. Yuck! Don't waste your time!"
4,Awesome.,"Having been very disappointed by the previous S/Down game on PS2, (& appalled by the godawful GameCube game), i was surprised when i started playing this game & realised that it's simply the best wrestling game ever. The graphics & features are simply stunning, & finally we have a proper season mode! It's great fun to play, (although it sticks to the tried & tested S/Down formula) & has enough options & surprises (like being able to squirt a fire extinguisher in your opponents' face, or jump in a car & run them over!) to keep even the most picky of fans happy. The presentation is amazing, with all of the music from the shows & great TV style presentation. Finally, a wrestling game that beats N64 No Mercy... buy it."
1,Words cannot explain...,"how bad this game really is. The controls are absolutely horrible. I was unbelievably upset that I actually spent $4 to rent this awful garbage. The only good thing about this game was the many different characters and different types of matches you could play. It nowhere near makes up for the lack of a decent control system. The people who made this game need to take lessons off the old WWF games for the N64, because this one is horrid. Don't waste your time or money, people. Please!!"
1,what is this?,this game is bad first of all because it almost the same thing as smacdown 3 it has story mode and just like 7 new wrestlers it will really bore in about an hour I thought it would be way better than smacdown 3 but its almost the same i reccomend for people to not get this game and if you do run to the store and return it.
4,great,this is good game you can do all kinds of stuff. Plus you have new wrestler to pick from. This is Excellent
4,This game is ok but not as good as smacdown 5,"I dont own this game but i played it round my friends house.First i liked it so much that i couldnt even stop playing it,but since i have had smackdown 5 i find this game is in the bottom line of sm5.firstly the players in sm5 are newer,also there theme music is newer aswell.The problem to this game is the commentary,they just say the same old thing everytime and says it repeatingly.Overall this is a good game but i would rather play sm5 even though it doesnt have announcer or commemtary."
4,Smackdown SYM,"This game rocks it has the draft thing in season mode and goes up till year 2004 or 2005.Theres a theater mode thats you can watch music videos that they put together. Theres a video about RVD, the Divas, the WWE Superstars, how they made the game (credits) and on called Smackdown Shut Your Mouth. But you have to unlock them. (I know how to unlock all of them.)The graphics are great! The face doesn't look exactly like them but their body does. I don't think theres any Womens title in this game. There 'Smackdown Move' or finisher looks real! While there doing it just press 'L1' then the screen will rotate and circle around them. It looks cool for like the swonton like that.You can even do your opponents finisher. Like if Spike Dudley challenged Brock Lesner Spike could be able to do the F5! (But theres a certain way you can do that and I know how. Its easier to figure this out than how to get all the videos.)(Im a bit older than what I put)"
4,Where is Scott Hall!!,"Awsome game! Can't get enough the playablility in career mode covers two years of wrestling history!! This is the way a wrestling game should be! BUT, I have one question?? Where is Scott Hall!! I know he had his problems with alcohol, but if you want to cover the nWo invasion, He is and was a member during that angle. The Developers of THQ get a huge thumbs down for this! If they want to make the story as true to life as they can, they need to have Scott Hall on the roster. Someone told me I could build him in the CAW, but that is not the point!! In closing, Best wrestling game out that is missing a key wrestler. Scott Hall and ""Razor Ramon"" rule All!"
5,"Finally, Smackdown Returns!","I just have to say I have been waiting too long for another SD game, but this one tops them all. The roster is bigger and better than ever. The matches are outstanding. The best thing about this game is you can recreate any match from the time WCW/ECW merged into the WWE. You can also recreated the matches from WM18 as well. I recommend this game to every die hard WWE fan out there cause you will not regret it."
5,***** star frog splash,"I GOT THIS GAME YESTERDAY AND IT IS SO COOL IT HAS ALL THE NEW WRESTLERS LIKE DDP, THE HURRICANE THE HULKSTER AND PLENTY MOREI JUST FINISHED THE DRAFT I TRIED TO COPY AS MANY PEOPLE TO BE ON THE RIGHT SHOWS EXCEPT VINCE AND RIC GET TO PICK 1 PERSON EACH AND RIC PICKS TAKER WHEN HES ON SMACKDOWN AND VINCE PICKS THE ROCK BUT THATS OK BECAUSE HE WAS ON SMACKDOWN.THERES ONE BAD THING THERE IS NO WOMENS TITLE JUST BECAUSE THEY THINK THERES NOT ENOUGH GIRLS.THE CREATE A WRESTLER MODE IS THE BEST I MADE AN EXACT REPLICA OF MYSELF DOWN TO THE LAST HAIR BUT I DONT WANT TO GIVE AWAY TO MUCH"
5,Best Wrestling game ever,"This is one of the best games ive ever played. Although, you cannot be Rey Mysterio it's still worth buying right away. There are several modes and the wrestling is realistic and the finishing moves are awsome. My favorite part of the game is the crowd chanting YOU SUCK when Kurt Angle walks down the ramp.Overall, GET THIS GAME RIGHT AWAY!!!!!!!"
5,just shut your mouth and play the game,"this is the best wrestling game presentliy available.season and caw mode have been improved.you can create scott steiner,batitta,goldberg,charlie haas and many more which are not in the rooster.there are so many types of exciting mathces like 6man tag,submision etc.this game is way better than previous games of wwf and wwe.highly reccomended.overall the best game around."
5,really good game,this game has everything you would want in a wrestling game it has a lot of new things new wrestlers and all new match types.The graphics are awesome and the gameplay is great.All smackdown fans should really get this game its worth the money.
4,"SYM will be ""the next big thing!""","SYM will be the wrestling game of all time!!! Now with ex-WCW Superstars such as Booker T and Rey Mysterio, combined with the WWE talents, this game is going to bring the HEAT! I have all the previous Smackdowns, but none of them will compare to this!!! The screenshots I have seen impressed me. They will to you also!"
5,this game is awesome!!!,this game is going to be one of the best games that has ever came out for ps2 or for any system so please buy it you will be saticfied with it thanks Jacob
2,"Get the ""F"" Out","This game is a SLIGHTLY better game then Just Bring It. The superstars do look awfully like the real-life wrestlering stars. There is finally a diffcultly setting, although it doesn't seem to work while you're doing a ""Season""The voice acting is a slight improvement, although it's J.R. and The King except for Tazz and Cole. The story lines are realistic and sometimes interesting. The only gripe I have about the game is an effective COUNTER system. The CPU is as relentless as in Just Bring It. The controls are easy to pick up, although you have to mash buttons to see different moves. I still think the best WWE game is WWF NO MERCY for the Nintendo 64. Shut Your Mouth does have more Wrestlers in it than Just Bring It did.A slight improvement over Just Bring It, but only slightly."
5,WWE Smackdown Shut your mouth,this game will be so cool they have new wrestlers in the game like Brock lesner and another cool effect is when the nwo comes out the screen turns black and white and they come out kurt angle is bald in the game there is new places you can fight like in new york and you can also fight in the subway hollywood hulk hogan comes out in red and yellow or nwo your choice shawn michaels will be on the game he has his pyro to this game is going to be awesome it is sceduled to come out the end of october so buy it I will.
5,good game,It's a pretty dope game. I like the smackdown and raw draft at the beginning of the story line. It is an awsome game to play
4,BIG IMPROVEMENT OVER SMACKDOWN 3,"THIS GAME WAS FANTASTIC. GOOD GRAPHICS, GOOD NUMBER OF CHARACTERS, AND YOU CAN EVEN CUSTOMIZE A WWE SUPERSTAR'S MOVE SET! THIS WAS THE 1ST GAME TO FEATURE BROCK LESNAR [WHO'S NOW GONNA PLAYING FOR THE NFL REAL SOON], BOOKER T, AND SEVERAL OTHER THEN NEWLY ADDED WRESTLERS. AND IT HAS THE BEST CREATE A WRESTLER MODE A WWE GAME HAS EVER HAD. PICK UP THIS GAME NOW!"
5,WWE Smackdown! Shut Your Mouth!,"WWE Smackdown! Shut Your Mouth is without a doubt the best wrestling game ever if not the best game period! The games graphics are incredible! You can see sweat and the faces cringe in pain for moves like the figure 4 leg lock! With all new wrestlers including: DDP, Stacy, Torrie Wilson, Rey Mysterio, Booker T, Billy, Chuck, Brock Lesnar, RVD, Jamie Orton, Lance Storm, Billy Kidman, Jon Cena, The Hurricane, Hulk Hogan, Batista, Shawn Micheals, The NWO (way cool entance!) and I think Rosie and Jamal are included. The entrances are new entrances and new outfits. A new and IMROVED story mode makes the game worth playing over and over again with new match types like inferno matches. Defintitly a must have for any wrestling or non-wrestling fan!..."
5,WWE shut your mouth is gonna KICK some [...]!! :),"oh yeah this game will rock!it has:Undertakers new music, and he comes out with his title around his neck (like in real life)The NEW RAW arenaNEW smackdown arenaJohn Cena confimedOrton confimedREY MYSTERIO confimed (woooo!!)Authentic entrancesSnow confimed (chucking SNOWBALLS is in!!)King Of the ring trophy will be givenand much much more!!"
3,It's Alright?... I Guess,"This game still lacks alot of the same features as did the previous Smackdown games.First of all, the wrestlers still speak to you and other wrestlers in closed captions. THQ by now should have had the wrestlers accually communicating with each other.The commentating by good ol' JR & Jerry Lawler is alot betterthan the commentating of Tazz & Micheal Cole from Shut Your Mouth.The other thing that disapointed me is that in season mode when you unlock the NWO, there was one superstar missing, Scott Hall.All & all game play is ok but I would not really recommend this game to anybody else."
3,ITS OK I GUESS,"The grafics are the bomb. It looks so real. It has a season mode that does every thing that happened on TV, like Edge shaves Kurt Angles hair off. There is every person I can think of on the game. Theres tons of different matches and there is ton of places you can go in a hardcore match. You can also do every persons special move. But the bad thing is it starts to get REALY boring after a while. But if you don't get bored easily buy because you'll love it. PEACE OUT!![.]"
5,The best yet,"Well, THQ delivers again with WWE SmackDown!: Shut Your Mouth for the PlayStation 2. Overall, this is a solid wrestling game that vastly improves over THQ's last effort, ""Just Bring It"". The story mode is exactly the kind of thing that has been lacking in previous THQ games, with a huge number of storylines and almost every single WWE Pay-Per-View event included. Graphics are the best yet, with lifelike models and the first-ever 3D crowd! Backstage areas are getting better and better, and becoming more interactive, as this game highlights. Another huge improvement are the moves - they are more television-style now with highspots (especially RVD's) and finishers being countered (i.e. the Pedigree into a backdrop). CAW mode is vastly improved as well, with a new, dynamic layering system and almost unlimited flexibility. Overall, this is simply a great game."
4,A African Prince's Attempted Entrance Into World Of Whites,"A well researched mid 19th century histrory of two Ghanian Princes who are sent to be educated in Holland only to encounter the depths of prejudice, a prejudice which is unspoken but a governing fact. Truly accepted by a few, a novelty for many, with no one willing to acknowledge the truth. It is a miracle that today Kwashi Boachi has decendants who can know the story of their forebearer and be proud of him as a caring, sensive human being. While the early part of the book was a bit slow, I found myself wanting to learn the story of the cousins lives and the truths these lives speak to us."
5,"46 tracks from Reprise and 4 from Capitol, Great Buy!","I highly recommend this 50 track collection. It contains some very hard to find songs from hard to find and out-of-print Reprise albums. However, the 3-cd set with the bonus cd ""Live in Paris"" is a better buy if you don't already own that one. The sound quality of the 2 cds is good! (I don't know if it has been newly remastered, it does't say anywhere on the cds or booklet.) This collection is a 2002 Reprise release."
5,Excellent.,"I strongly recommend this book. It is even-handed in its approach, admitting what we can and cannot know from natural law alone. And you can safely disregard the Publisher's Weekly commentary, particularly the comment regarding utilitarianism, as it IS in fact fairly dealt with (despite not being the primary subject of this book). For a more thorough critique of utilitarianism, see the first part of Love and Responsibility, by Karol Wojtyla."
1,Preaching to the converted - why bother?,"To his credit Budziszewski at the outset states the book is not intended to convince the atheist, agnostic nor the skeptic, (be the fly on the wall) For the Christian, I imagine it is a convincing read.Unfortunately, for someone who is attempting to understand Natural Law without relying on a heavy dose of Christian homily, it is bewildering and seemingly replete with circular, self-referencing. The author is aware of this and makes no excuses. But this all begs the question, why write a book for people who are already convinced they are in the moral right because the Bible says so?There even is a substantial section about Intelligent Design, a proposition so distant from a philosopher's roots and so extreme a ""scientific"" stance, which gives you a thumbnail measure of how objective Budziszewski's viewpoint is from his Texas school."
5,Nice pics!,"From Ambrosia to Yes, Lawhon distills the drama and passion of live performances of musical giants through his camera lens. I was a mere pup in the 1970s and didn't attend my first rock concert until the mid-1980s, so it was nice to be able to see all the pics of 1970s bands."
5,Great for the bilingual children,"Great product!! My son (18 months) loved it from the minute I opened the box. It plays the numbers (1-10) and the entire Spanish alphabet, one by one as you hit the drum. It has two other settings so that they can play with it as a drum. It has two volume settings as well. Batteries come in the product.This is a wonderful product to teach children the numbers and letters at their pace.I don't particularly enjoy the stereotypical music, but that's my only complaint.Enjoy!!"
3,"An ""okay"" drum..",I was a little disappointed in this drum. A couple of the lights burned out rather quickly so it's somewhat hard to read and it's kind of boring...I expected more from this brand.
3,Doesn't hold my daughter's interest,"My daughter got this toy about a year ago (8 mos old). She kind of liked it then, but I hoped she would ger more enjoyment out of it as she grew. Now, she completely understands how it works and can turn it on, but she doesn't play with it very long. I would say she has never played with it for more than 5 minutes and usually for much less time. It is a good concept, but for it's selling price, there are a lot of other toys that entertain her longer."
4,Warmhearted Tale!,"Book two, FOREVER, ROSE in the Americana series is a sensitive story of love being found when one's head and heart felt otherwise.Although each one of the four books in the series: 1. WHERE THE HEART IS 2. FOREVER, ROSE 3. REMEMBER WHEN 4. KISS ME, KATIE can stand alone, it's my recommendation you read the books in order. Many of Homestead, Idaho's secondary characters are first and thoroughly described in book one. Many stories of the town's original characters descendents continues on in REMEMBER WHEN and KISS ME, KATIE. Some becoming new main characters and of course, it's always a treat to revisit the ones we grew to love."
5,lovely,this is such a unique and perfect piece. such a great present. a truely wonderful surprise that is sure to bring joy.
2,"Fairy? yes.. Love igniter? sadly, no..",I bought this fairy in hopes of spicing up a marriage gone sour.. It didn't work.Does what it says but was not exceptional in any way.
5,"WOW, Just get it!!!!!!!!!!!","If you love The Knife/Fever Ray, this is a great example of Her work with her brother Orlof Andersen. If you haven't seen the video, you can probably download it somewhere. I would say buy it from somewhere, but it's no where to be found for sale, it has ceased production."
3,I liked it.........For a while,"I will admit that I enjoyed this game for around a week or so. The gameplay was repititous, and took alot more time than I would take to finish the levels. I still play it on and off, although I paid $40 for the dang thing(wish I would have checked amazon.com before making that splurge)"
1,Not the best game,"There's nothing wrong with this game other than the fact itsextremely boring. The graphics are decent, the gameplay is poor. Graphics don't count for much in my book. Even though you get up to 15 games on 1 cartrige, it just isn't worth it, as most of these games have little or no interest."
1,no way,When I got this game i thought it was going to have a little challenging mini games. ya right it stunk and all u get is stupid EASY!!!! games and the gallary stinks and some things u can only watch/see
3,wahahahaha~,"ok....so it's basically an ancient game that people used to play when there weren't gbas. instead, theses games were on a watch. it's very addicting but i'd rather play yoshi's island than this old old old~~ antique."
2,Ripoff for the old folks who played it and are now rich,"This is just a money ripper aimed at kids from the 80's who have played these. Some of them are now rich, feel nostalgic about their childhood, and must get this game. The ones don't have much money still buy it by only eating once a day for about a week."
1,Elitist trash that will harm your children's educational future!,"LIke so many of the reviewers, I too had this series grade 1-6. Only after moving to a new town at the beginning of the 7th grade did I find out I knew NOTHING about grammar. No one anywhere else had ever heard of the way I described grammar after 6 years of indoctrination with Robert's. I had to start all over as well and suffered some bad test scores for a while, after having been a straight A student all of my life before that. This method of teaching is the grammatical equivalent of rewriting history in total ignorance of recorded factual information, just to have it your way. I make an exception to my general disgust for book burning for Robert's English."
1,"No, no, no, NO!","In the early 1970s, my school system adopted Roberts English as its grammar curriculum. My 2nd grade class was the first class to use it. The school system abandoned it when I was in 8th grade. It was the most confusing, confounding, ridiculous way to teach grammar. My 9th grade English teacher was horrified when we (the first group of students ""brought up"" on Roberts English) appeared in his class and didn't know the first thing about grammar. He had to start all over, subject-verb-predicate. I still don't know the parts of speech. Whatever you do, DO NOT teach Roberts English!"
1,I too was raised on military bases,"...and I think this series is the worst travesty foisted upon me in my entire school career.Fortunately for me, we were stationed for three years in a city whose schools taught grammar in the ""old fashioned"" way.Please do not inflict this series on your children."
3,Academic concepts,"I've only been able to read through the first 3 chapters of this book because it's written in a very dry, academic style. While it brings up a lot of interesting issues that affect VC's, it's done from an economic/academic perspective.For example, it describes 3 different categories of covenants that restrict VC partners (overall fund management, activities of the general partners, and restrictions on the types of investments). But, rather than offer case studies on how these covenants play out in the development of the fund, it delves into statistical correlation of these covenants with different fund variables (such as size, rate of growth, and age of venture).It's probably fascinating stuff if you're an economist, but I'm not sure it's that helpful to anyone who's setting up a fund or is interested in working for a fund."
2,Not practical,"I am forced to use this book for level 2 CAIA certification. Unfortunately, unlike the other titles in the curriculum, this title has little or no practical application for evaluating VC investments.As stated previously, the book is long on statistics and ideas ""for further research"" but short on practical application.This title was painful to get through and I will recommend it be removed from the curriculum for the CAIA."
3,Not a practical book for VCs,"The authors are two Harvard b-school academics who carried out a rigorous, disciplined, statistical analysis of a venture capital deal database. Their research identified a variety of patterns -- some of them interesting, others predictable.Frankly, the conclusions could've been handily summarized in a SHORT article written for the Harvard Business Review. Therefore, I recommend that VC practitioners skim each chapter's conclusions, and skip over the rest.Only if you love the blow-by-blow minutiae of academic statistical analysis, would you feel impelled to slog through the book's dry, methodical expositions of hypotheses, statistical procedures, and summary tables.Besides, a substantial portion of the book betrays an academic's fascination with why VCs do things the way they do, rather than with identifying profitable new alternatives. All in all, not a practical book for VCs."
3,A Solid Effort!,"The Venture Capital Cycle is a thorough overview of the venture capital market that will be edifying to those who know little about the mysterious methods of private equity financiers, but self-evident to those with a background in corporate finance. Readers who have worked in or studied finance already are familiar with the tidal cycles that govern the flow of capital into early-stage companies, as well as the process through which money moves from institutions and individuals to fledgling enterprises. But we [...] strongly recommend that entrepreneurs read this book, which provides an exhaustive tour that will answer many - if not all - of your questions about where venture capital comes from, how you can get a hold of some, and how your life and business will change after you do. And if, along the way, you think that the authors sound too much like professors with their dense, academic prose, you're right."
1,WHAT ABOUT PORTUGAL?,"I must confess I didn't read the book, but the reviews only mention ""Spanish and Italian Costumes"".For those who don't know, PORTUGAL IS NOT SPAIN!Thank you.Maria Edite Filipe"
3,"A good idea, but...","I love the idea of keeping my purse off the ground. This is a well made product. However, the hook is not big enough to fit on many thick restaurant tables. My sister has one called the ""Little Hooker"". That one offers more room to accomodate thicker tables."
4,Very Cool,"This purse hanger is very cool - I get a lot of comments when I use it and it works wonderfully. The only problem was that I had the initial ""A"" put on it, and it rubbed off completely in the first few weeks of use."
3,Informative but Blurred,"I agree with the other reviewers that this book is very informative and helpful. However, if you also like gorgeous garden photos you're bound to be somewhat disappointed. There are lots of photos, but they aren't in sharp focus. Sometimes only one flower or a portion of a background picket fence is all that is sharply focussed. I understand blurring to accent a particular flower, but that is not what has been done here. It's more like the shots of middle-aged movie stars where close-ups are in soft-focus to soften their aging. Ridiculous there, very annoying in a book where you expect the photos to be outstanding. Still they show nice composition and groupings."
2,Is this about 1 John?,"Usually I like John Ortberg. But this book claims to be a study of 1 John. Though I've only done the first 3 lessons so far, I've seen incredibly little in it about the historical setting of 1 John, and it refers much more to other books of the Bible than to 1 John. Also, the applications seem to reflect a shallow/limited experience of life and its complexities."
1,A (failed) model of an Icon,"I was just browsing through the Amazon listings, to find more books on Fallingwater to add to my collection. When it comes to that iconic structure.....the more information, the better. I have to admit I was captivated by the concept that there was a book about ""the model"" of Fallingwater, and before I took the plunge and ordered the book, I decided to do a Google Image Search to see what the model looks like. As someone who has visited Fallingwater many times, I did a double take......I guess there is room for debate, but (to me) this model does NOT resemble the structure in the least. And the fact that it has become the subject of a book, plus has gotten the approval of MOMA.....I guess I simply don't understand how this benign little model surrounded by a fewtimid tiny twigs has gotten such recognition. So, bear with me if this review has turned into a commentary on the Model itself, instead of the book. Harumph!"
5,A controversial new view of the origins of the Arab state,"Crossroads To Islam is an informed and informative survey of the origins of the Arab religion and state is an important addition to the literature on Arab-American history: it's written by an archaeologist who spent months in the field as well as conducting research, and provides a fine multifaceted survey of the findings of recent important excavations. Anticipate a controversial new view of the origins of the Arab state."
1,Pseudo-Scholarship,"The authors, neither one of them possessing credentials as historians, make specious arguments to advance an agenda, distorting or omitting the important evidence or issues whenever it serves their purposes. For a sound overview of how desperate this book is to torture the evidence into supporting its preconceived conclusions, see a recent issue of the Bryn Mawr Classical Review (ccat.sas.upenn.edu/bmcr/2004/2004-02-33.html)."
4,Another very good book,"I've bought each Alex McKnight novel right when it's been released, and I just re-read ""Ice Run."" Steve Hamilton is an excellent writer; he always has a great plot and his atmospheric writing is tops, with references to heavy snow, cold, and desolate places. The settings for his McKnight novels are great; this one includes Ontario, Soo Michigan and Soo Canada, and Mackinac Island in addition to the Paradise, Michigan, base. My only quibble is that at one point Hamilton has Alex filling his gas tank in Canada and notes the imperial gallons. Canada hasn't used imperial gallons in decades; gas is purchased by the liter."
5,Another Heart Thumping Adventure,"Alex McKnight is back and in trouble again! This time he has a love interest, Natalie the Canadian Policer Officer form 'Blood is the Sky' ( Now we know what they got up to New Years Eve eh!) Alex & Natalie meet up at a hotel, when they return from dinner, back to their room, they discover and old hat outside their door, filled with ice and snow, inside they discover a note 'I KNOW WHO YOU ARE'. Is this note directed at Alex or Natalie? Alex wanting to find out more, starts making inquiries leading him deeper and deeper into trouble. Another excellent heart thumping thriller by this author"
4,Sharkira's CDs,"It is a good collection, with 2 different cd's, one in Spanish and one in English. Very good."
5,Great Packaged but still missing all the videos and songs,"Ok, you already know the product: FIJACION ORAL 1 y ORAL FIXATION2. FO1 gets 5 stars from me and OF2 gets 4 stars (only because they added Hips dont lie and La Tortura remix). The packaged itself gets a 5 stars rating.However, if youre planning to buy this pack considering this is the complete Oral fixation project think again: The DVD is missing her latest videos: LA PARED, LAS DE LA INTUICION & ILLEGAL. Plus, theres a english version of Las de la Intuicion not included on any of the cds that comes with this package.As I said before get this is you want it for what it is, but if u really want the whole project you wont get it with this pack. Hope that helps :)"
3,The Blending and Mixing of Cultures,"In early 2002, a friend from Bogota told me of this new, young singerthat was becoming a rage in Colombia.I listened to her earlier work and realized that this young artist would be hot -it was just a matter of time.Shakira does not dissapoint.Best songs:Las De La IntuicionEn Tus PupilasPara Obtener Un SiHow Do You DoLa Tortura - Sanz AlternativeA remarkable burst of creativity combining Latin, Anglo, Reggae, Arabic, Mexican - pop rock.A fusion of different cultural sounds resulting in something fresh and wonderful.Volume One is Latin.Even though you may not understand the words, the music takes you to a placewhere barriers do not exsist.Volume Two is in English.The lyrics are weak.Not a great collection of songs, but ...The DVD (especially the first music video) is excellent."
1,Pitiful,"Tony Hawk 4 for PS1 is simply dissapointing. First of all, the graphics do not improve from the first and second games, the levels are no bigger then those of the first and second games, and the only new feature is the new goal format. The fact that this would acctually be sold is disgusting. Buy it for PS2, not PS1, you'll be unhappy with your purchase. 30 dollars spent here is definitley 30 dollars wasted."
2,this [stinks]!,"I bought this game thinking that I can skitch go through traffic and talk to people. But that's a load of crud, after reading the stategy guide I thought it was the best game ever. the two player mode is not satisfying and neither are the levels. And knowing that I can't return it and cant buy a ps2 because I recently bougth the ps1 i'm really upset. So now that it's a loss I guess I have to live with it."
1,tony hawks pro skater 4 for the ps2 system,"this is the most retarded game ever. Neversoft put no thought at all into this game. When i first played it i thought it would be a very good game, I WAS WRONG. Do not buy this game it is a total waste of money."
5,tony hawk pro skater 4,man this game is like 5 out of 5 it is the bomb you will love this game like it where real live levels like sanfran london and chicogo. if i hated skateboarding but i dont i would get this game. not because its a game because it looks like somthing intressting better than the rest. irate it the best game of 2002 and 2003. every one i know wants it wich would be probeble my hole school. i know i like it i have like gotten most the levels its asome. specail thanks to tony hawk and activision you made it all happen...
3,Not as good as the previous 3,I like the implementation of a few new little features but all in all it doesnt have the replay value of the first 3 games in the series.
3,okay but the last ones were better,"Yeah, heres one last attempt from THPS to grab a couple grand from some rearing tony hawk nerds waiting for this years edition.The graphics are decent, the levels are decent, the tricks are decent. A mediocre game but still fun to just ride around and trick up ledges and stuff. Instead of the mission list u get for each level u ride around and go through these little icon things and then it gives u a mission to do. A stupid idea but the dudes at THPS probably try and change it up every year. Sountrack is okay but there is only five levels. Okay game but dont go gettin ur hopes up."
5,The best all-around climbing reference book I've found,"As a beginning climber, I wanted to find a book that would cover all the basics under one cover. I went to several book stores and made lots of comparisons before purchasing ""The Complete Rock Climber"". This is a definite must-have book for beginners, and even more experienced climbers will benefit from the comprehensive coverage of the sport. Full color pictures and diagrams illustrate a lot of the great information you'll find here, including equipment, knots, ropes, holds and training. The book even covers such topics as navigation, mountain weather and first aid. If you're looking for a great all-around climbing reference, this is the book for you."
4,"Nice, but","unfortunately the case has a habit of slipping off the phone when the phone is open. I like the charger and having the extra earbud is a definite plus. The price is great - it was $14.99 at most sites just for the case. I would recommend this, just be aware that the case slips (perhaps with time it won't - I have only had this in use for a couple of weeks now)."
2,Not a good bargain,"I ordered 2 combo packs: one for the Samsung A640 and one for the Samsung T319 but ended up returning both. At first, it seems to be a good buy for this type of combo packs but the quality and fitness of the items are not worth the money. I had a separate review for the A640 combo pack but it did not deviate much from what I said in this review for the T319 combo pack. The leather case does not fit the T319 phone well as I've expected. Compare to the one for the A640, it is still somewhat better in shape. The ear set size is kind of bigger than it should and therefore is kind of dangling in my ear rather than fits nicely and stays put. I think this is normal with Samsung made ear set because I had the same problem with the original set that came with the T319 phone. Among the 3 items in the combo pack, the car charger is OK. What a disappoinment."
4,"Kids love scary stuff, and this book delivers!","Hypermagnified, strikingly posed or peacefully in wait, the creatures of ""Youch!"" are brought to life in words and pics that tell the story just as they are. Scary creatures! I read this with my 5 year old son last night and he was fascinated and not the least uncomfortable. Kids love to be shocked; witness the faces of children at a wild animal show or even the circus.Love the format, love the photos."
1,yuck,I was looking for something for my 2yr old son. This was not it. Even the type uploaded to my kindle was all wrong. Sentences didn't match up. Gaps in paragraphs. Good thing it was free. Already deleted it.
2,Public domain without a rework,It would have been nice to see the old illustrations that would make these classics brilliant. As it stands this book is not for children.
3,Only good for kids that are 7-9 Years old...,"I was browsing at some books, to give to my son. I saw this book and decided to try it. I read some of the reveiws and saw that one person gave it 5 stars, so I bought it. I open the book and showed my son, but as soon as he finished reading, he asked me if this was a joke.... I read it and realized if my dad had bought this for me, I would say the same thing! If I was in second grade, I would have enjoyed reading it, but it wouldn`t be a recommendation. Buy this book if you have a little child, but have them know how to read chapter books first."
1,An ok book for me,The book is boring and i just rate it 1 stars beacuse other books cost money and this don't WARNING.
2,HARD,I HAVE GROWN LOST OF WHEAT GRASS BEFORE AND ALL WAYS HAD GOOD RESULTS WITH THIS ONE I HAVE STRUGGLED A LOT I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT AT ALL.
2,Not the best Bollywood film out there,"I was a bit disappointed with this Bollywood film. I am a huge fan of Bollywood, and was underwhelmed with this movie. It was fine to watch, but not a film I'd want in my permanent Bollywood collection. If you're interested in purchasing a great Bollywood film, I'd recommend Veer Zaara, Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge, Lagaan, Dil Bole Hadippa, Vivah, Kuch Kuch Hota Hai, etc. over this one."
3,Very fun and interesting book,"This is a great book to get you started in self-expressive journaling and doodling. There is such a variety of reflections and exercises- you can pick and choose the ones you're in the mood to do. I haven't finished going through all of the exercises, but it is a fun book so far. The pages are filled with doodles and drawings by the author. They invite play and spontaneity. It is a great way to get to know yourself better and explore a new means of self-expression."
1,dissapointing,"Spiritual Doodles and Mental Leapfrogs: Playbook for Unleashing Spiritual Self ExpressionWhat a disappointment. If I had seen it before buying I would not have purchased it. It is written in poor hand-printing which makes it hard to read. The suggestions seem recycled, not new and not interesting. I would have returned it except for the bother of shipping it back to Amazon."
2,Shamefull.....,"Totally and utterly disapointing, this may be an ok gameif you only own a gamecube. Compare this hard dodgy frustratingFPS to something like Metal Gear Solid 2 or Hitman 2.Conclusion:Best Game Ever? Pah! don't make me laugh."
2,Not Great,"This game is dumb! It is impossible to win a level with out having to start over again 500,000,000,000,000,000,000,(...)times!!!! There is a little bit of cool stuff, but otherwise it's too violent! The scan visor is really cool, but when you scan dead Space Pirates, the cause of death is gross! It's usually something like, ""Cause of death: removal of internal organs"" or ""Cause of death: the severing of the spinal cord""! Belive me, if you have kids under 10 do not buy this for them! It's too violent."
1,Huge disappointment,"I love FPS on PC's, and I loved Goldeneye on the N64. That being said, I did not like Metroid Prime one bit. Luckily, I got a good deal and picked it up for $12 but I still regret it. The game just isn't meant to be played on a controller. The gameplay is slow and boring. It even made me dizzy after 1 level of play. Do not buy this game... if you MUST play it, rent it only!"
2,dont get the hype,yes the graphics good. gameplay incredibly boring. easy game youll blaze right trough it.repeating the same repetitive action the same thing over and over with no innivation or challenge. i think halo is better than this. if you want a better shooter sell the gaycube and get xbox. or get jak 2 on playstation 2. those games are both better than metroid prime. MUCH BETTER ...PEOPLE.``.
3,Metroid Prime,My son wanted this for Christmas. I got a great deal on it and he enjoyed playing the game. Very satisfied.
5,Digital nirvana,"I can't believe how amazingly beautiful Metroid Prime is. From the sound of the snow crunching under your boots to the seemingly endless passages of the Chozo ruins to that unreal shot inside the wrecked ship (go to the entrance in ball form and let yourself drop. It's a huge rush watching yourself fall), it's all incredible.I finally finished MP yesterday, then went back and began again. It's much more fun the second time, knowing most of the tricks and how to avoid little pitfalls (it took me at least 20 tries to escape the ship the first time I played; did it on the first try with 90 seconds to spare this time). I can't wait to go home and play some more. Buy this game, or rent it and call in sick for a week."
5,2002 Game of the Year for any console,"This game took 3 years to make, and 5 years just to get started, so of course you have to expect near the best ever from it. It has awesome graphics, excellent sound, and the best first-person controls I've ever seen, this game is extremely fun, and addictive. When you just begin playing, you're just thinking,""Yeah, this game is alright, but I just don't see why its so good yet!"" Then when you decide you're done, you can't even put the controller down! So you keep playing and don't realize just how much fun you really are having until you've had it a few weeks or a month even. I suggest this game to anyone who has a GameCube and likes original Nintendo games. NOTE: This is NO first-person shooter! This has very, very hard puzzles, and that and the story is what the game is based on. You're arm cannon is just a defense, like Link's sword."
5,Worth the 8 year wait and more!!!!!!!!!,"All I have to say is WOW. I have played games for 20 years so I remeber the oldies but goodies and once again Nintendo has managed to take games a step above. For those old enough to remember the Metroid series you will be VERY, no, EXTREMLY pleased what a game one of the best I have every played!"
5,HOLY (bleep) !!!,"I don't want say much, every thing was said by other reviewers already. But OH MY GOD, HOLY---! This is an unbelievable game, I don't want to finish it, I want to stay in that world....! MAN!"
3,Very Atmospheric game,"I got this game with the purchase of my SECOND gamecube. The first one kept freezing up or not starting the game at all, and I am very careful with my games. Anyways, I rented this game on my first gamecube and I was blown away by the graphics, the sound, everything. I felt like i was in a different world completely, and nothing anyone said was going to take me away from that world. Then the game froze. I played again, and it froze. I was really pissed off.Then I got a new gamecube after about six months later, and it came with Metroid Prime. I had never played the game until today, just because I was bored with all the other games that I have beaten to death. About 1 to 1 and a half hours into the game, it FROZE! It was a completely different copy of the game and a different game system. Maybe I just have bad luck..."
5,One of the best games I have ever played.,"Out of every game i have ever played or tested etc. this is most likely number 2. (1 being Blizzard's Starcraft) Although it came out for the GCN in '01, the graphics reign supreme over any game i have ever seen in these past 3 years. Some say Metroid Prime is like GCN's Halo. I say it is better. The game is long, the game is challenging, and the story is immensely well constructed. And if you do beat the game, and are up for another challenge... Try the newly unlocked ""hard mode"".Pros--Hours of fun in an insanely detailed extremely large world.-Complex puzzles and a deep story with even it's own history.-Connection bonuses with Metroid Fusion.-Being a Metroid fan helps, but is not necessary to enjoy.-Many new items to collect.-Everything else...Cons--No multiplayer... (yet) heheheh.All in all, as i said, It is one of the best. An IMPERITIVE must have for all GCN and Metroid fans."
4,Real good game,"This game is awesome! This game has an easy control setup which even younger kids could use. The action and puzzles are intense and really fun. But there's something that ticks me off. In the game you have to find Save Stations which there aren't enough of. I know it's a tradition for Metroid game's to have Save Stations, but they could have put a few more in the final game. That's why I don't give it a 5 star rating."
5,"Features of ""Metroid Prime""","Good Features:-The most realistic game I have ever seen since DOA-Totally varied gameplay-Samus is our official savior-Sounds like you are in a big screen theater-Blowing enemies to oblivion is fun as hell-Takes you on an continuous explorationBad Features:-THIS WILL MESS UP YOUR HEAD, ALOT!-Controlling Samus does become a problem at first-When you make the creatures very mad(THEY DO NOT PLAY WITH YOU)Strange Features:-How come you can't kill everybody?The awards for:Best basic weapon: The plasma beamBest special weapon: The tailshocker(The wave beam missile combo)Best gadget: The morph ballCreulest boss: Omega pirateMost formidable enemies(2): Metroid Prime and ThardusNot-so-tough boss: Meta-RidleyThe Overall:Got a Gamecube? Put this in your collection if you want the greatest games ever!"
5,Prime ROCKS!,"Metroid Prime is probably the best game that I have ever played. If you own a gamecube and you don't have this game, my only question to you is: why? Go buy it, now. I'm a big fan of the other Metroid games, so naturally I had to pick it up. I don't like first person shooters, but I can't shut this game off, it's so incredible. The graphics alone are better than anything the gamecube has put out in the past. Rain actually hits your gun (or your visor if you look up), steam condensing on the visor...it's just awesome. Nintendo needs to make more games like this and less like Luigi's Mansion..."
5,Buy this game now. Period.,"If you are even remotely considering buying this game, BUY IT NOW. You will NOT regret it.I personally was not a big fan of the previous Metroid titles and didn't think much of this game initially . . . until I played it.This game is mind-blowing on so many different levels! The graphics are second-to-none, animations are fantastic, the frame rate never slows down, all cinematics are rendered in-game. There is no better title out to showcase the power of your Nintendo GameCube console.If you have a GameCube but not this game, you are doing yourself a disservice. (Though I personally would not recommend it for gamers under 16.)One word of advice however; be prepared to say goodbye to friends and family. This game will suck you in and consume you until youve complete it.I didn't believe the hype, but after every session, I've come out saying, ""This Game [is great]"""
5,One of the Greats,"I've played the old Metroid and I thought that was challenging and fun. I've played the new Metroid and I thought it was the greatest thing. It's challenging but you find new things all throughout the game. The graphics are the best I've seen on any game and all the equipment that you get is awesome. If you are looking for a Christmas gift or if you have some extra money to blow, I would definitely get this game. No questions asked."
4,Come on people...,"All I hear on these review is ""This game is Incredible"" or ""I *HATE* this game. Why can't anyone give an intelligent review based on something other than personal preference. Metriod prime exells in it graphic development. The gameplay is solid and feels more like an adventure than a FPS (probably due to the auto-lock feature). Im outta time..."
5,The best game ever.,"I can't say enough about this game. It is THE most detailed game anyone has seen yet. The cool part is you uncover the story instead of having the story told to you. One of my faverite features in the game is the scan visor. Sure it may slow the game down at times, but it doesn't matter when you're having so much fun. But what realy amazes me is the way the bad guys die. I can't explain it so you'll just have to see it for yourself. And the creatures are amazing. Metroid fans have to get this. Non-Metroid fans should at least give it a try."
5,surprisingly good,"im not really into first person view games sthe only ones i play would be like halo,counter strike, and this. the first time i saw this game i thought it be a horrible game since it was diffrent game style of play than the other metroid games but i was surprised how good this game is. you can do many things in that game and it can play the original metroid if you have the game boy advanced link and metroid fusion."
4,good game but bad controlling,This is all im going to say is that the game itself is a good graphical and well plotted game and the 3D worlds are pretty cool but the thing that i could just not get over was the fact that you cant look up or down in this game. It gets really annoying when you cant look into the sky or look at your feet. In every other game ive played thats in the same category you can look anywhere you want. It might be just me but it gets so annoying that i dont even want to play it. I think that the designers of this game were really stupid for not allowing the up and down view.
2,Ignore the LOLs,"This is a half-decent FPS. However, it's nothing short of a mockery of Metroid. The gameplay is clunky, the graphics are poor (highlights are not white light, consult any second year illustrator and he'll tell you), and the controls are terrible."
4,May be great (and M rated as well) !,"Metroid Prime is going to be one of the biggest releases this year! The graphics and sound are amazing! A friend of mine went to this E3 not long ago and said it just may blow Halo (One of the best shooters I have ever played, rival to anything on the PC) out of the water. He also said it had enough bug goo to be rated Mature by theh ESRB (nice to know Nitendo is stepping away from the 'little kid' crowd and appeasing us serious gamers). Anyway, I have high expectations for this title. If I have any worries, it's that the game may be a tad to much o the adventure side, and less on the shooter side (this is the only reason I did not give five stars)."
2,If Nintendo got a dime for graphics...,"If Nintendo had a dime for every graphic horizon, they'd be rich. For starters, always was a fan of First person shooters, but then this game came out. In its seemingly unbeatable box, with even it's graphics to boast on the thing, it came in at 50 bucks. Now, after playing for a few hours, I was content with graphics, but then, the game fell. In my mind it just fell. It hit me like a brick. Where's the story line? What is with Samus. Why doesn't she have her suit, and most importantly, what the heck is up with these dark levels! For one, it sets a mood, but the glares are unbelivable in some levels if you play during the day. Now that can be fixed but, it's feel is lost after you play and shoot things for hours. Oh and yeah by the way, don't forget about those loads OF FUN rune puzzles, which are, by the way, in every single game."
2,What Can I say,"I did not care for this game. Every one else loves it. I see that a lot went in to it, but I did not enjoy it. I do like Mario Sunshine, and I like Zeldas new graphics..."
1,worst FPS EVER!!!!,First of all i love first person shooters but this is horrible. its repetitive and lame. i like the Metroid ames on GBA BUT the first person perspecive really is no good. and the graphics are great but the controls are bad. why is there a lock on button on a FPS??Also there is way too much reading and no voice acting. and there is no story at all. There is also way to much backtracking to areas you have already been too. Just avoid this pitiful excuse for a game if you can. get Resident Evil 4 instead or Mario Kart those games are classics.
5,I see no problems really,"This is one of the best games I've played.The graphics can't get any better than this!It should amuse you for like two months.I like how you're right under samus's visor.The enviorment is exelent and detailed.I can't belive I hear people on the internet say it's like Halo.If you're looking for a shooter game,don't be fooled,this is nothing like one.On the other hand,if you're looking for an adventure game,get it because you'll love it.The music is good to.I like the techno,gloomy toons.I also love the gameplay.You can switch to scan visor and scan enimies,and find thier weaknesess.This game is really cool,everything about the game is."
5,"smooth and seamless gameplay, beautiful to the eye","Smooth and seamless, the game transitions from one stage to the next without a single second of load time at all. The game graphics are without a doubt one of the best to date, with several million polygons used for every character you see... all fully 3d, and moving well above a constant 60 frames a second without any signs of slowdown. It's obvious that the developers put an incredible amount of work into the detail of the environment- easily the most atmospheric of any game i've played, there isn't a single corner that hasn't been intricately hand crafted to perfection. The game play is surprisingly smooth and unlike any first person shooter, but instead plays more along the platform genre where jumps are done easily and the controls are fairly intuitive without much of an emphasis on shooting skills like your typical doom game. Definitely a top notch adventure game that I will continue to be glued to for the next two weeks."
5,Incredible Game,"Immersive environment, exiting gameplay, great graphics (for back then) and a story that will keep you interested thoughout the whole game. I can really say that this is one game that I can play over and over again, and still feel exited about it. Not a pro review nor in depth what so ever, but if you have heard good things about it, it is all true. Check out the video review by one of Gamespot's former Chief Editor, you will see what I mean."
5,Metroid Prime,"Metroid Prime can be connected to the newly released Metroid Fusion via the Game Boy Advance Link, unlocking two bonus features. Completing Fusion unlocks the entire original Metroid on the Gamecube. They've actually improved upon the original Metroid by adding the ability to save within the game. Completing Prime opens up the ability to play Metroid Prime with a Fusion suit. This change is only cosmetic, as it doesn't grant Samus any new voodoo powers or the ability to talk with the Metroids."
5,metroid pime game of 2002,"Metroid Prime had me excited ever since I heard of it.Even though it was a FPS. before Metroid Prime I thought FPS games [were bad]. I'm glad to say that Metroid Prime is the best gamecube game ever. Any one with out a gamecube buy one for this game, it's well worth it since the legend of zelda the wind waker is the only game that has a chance of taking Prime's crown.Anybody with [$$}and a gamecube buy this game! If you don't have fifty dollars do what ever it takes to get the cash. Graphics: 5 out of 5: the graphics are incredible great speical effects, great monsters,great looking envirements.Gamplay 5 out of 5: There is no word to describe how fun Prime is. Locking on to to eniemies and blasten um to bits useing the plasma beam to frime eniemeys to ash. finaly finding the 12 artifact. Every moment of game play is pure FUN!"
4,BEST GAME ON GAMECUBE,I believe thatt this is easily the best game ever made for gamecube. Zelda will have to make the greatest game possible to beat Metroid Prime. The only problem with this game is it is SO long...not a problem for me but you must have patience.BUY IT NOW
5,best game ever cant wait for number 2!,i would definitely recommend this game to everyone. i loved everything in this game especially the plasma beam. best game everrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr!
5,A great game that's not too hard,"Metroid Prime is a great game, from the incredible graphics (especially for a gamecube game) to the intuitive game play. A lot of people complain about the degree of difficulty, but that's what makes it a good game. More joy comes out of beating a hard game than a game a two-year old could beat, which seems pretty obvious. Also, I am one of the least skilled gamers I know and I was able to beat the game. The hardest part is just finding a few of the Chozo artifacts, but since the game gives you hints it's not even close to impossible. Overall this is my favorite cube game; from the beautiful environments to the puzzles to the high sense of reward this game is awesome."
5,"Very, Very, Good!!!!!!!!!","This would have to be one of the best games I have ever played. I have only had it for a week and I barely tore myself away from my cube to write this. The graphics are unbelievable, the gameplay is awesome, and the music is excellent! People say the controls are hard to get used to, I got them down in 5 minutes. I have played Halo, GTA:VC, and all those other games, but I think Metroid Prime surpasses all of them. I haven't played any of the other Metroid games, but I still love this one. You should buy this game if you have a Gamecube. if you don't have a Gamecube, buy one and get Metroid Prime."
5,"Excellent game, kind of short though...","WHile the graphics and gameplay are excellent, after playing for any extended period of time, you're already 10 percent done with the game, then 20, then 30, and so on.But besides this downfall, the game is very fun and challenging at some points. It's not just a go-out-and-shoot-them-up game. You must apply some brain power to some puzzels that the game has to offer.All in all, most people would find this game great and challenging, plus, if you have a completed version of Metroid Fusion, you can hook it up to Metroid Prime, and get the original Metroid."
5,This Game is really great,"Metroid Prime offers a whole new perspective of gaming. The Scan, Combat, Thermal, and X-Ray Visors are really cool and helpful during the game. There are many ugrades and stuff for your arm cannon and you can collect a lot of energy tanks and missles expansions and power bomb expansions. No doubt, this is 5+ star and probably the best 1st person game on Gamecube."
5,Dummies,"This is great. Those who put it 4 or 5 stars, you are the best.Those who put it 3 stars and under,YOU ARE MENTALLY RETARDED. THAT'S RIGHT RETARDED."
3,Not Rated,This game was purchased as a gift. The young family member likes the game graphics and whatever other features it has. He really has not said one way or the other
4,Good but bad controls,"Metroid fans will definitley get a kick out of this, but other people, might not. The thing in Prime is that it's a FPS, but they don't use both of the analog sticks! Hello?! FPS?! To aim up, I'll just hold the ""R"" Trigger and move it. And You can't change that! Although the graphics are nice, it's very easy to get lost in the forest like areas. The game is fun, but sometimes the fun will be killed because of the controls."
5,metroid prime rocks!!!!!! :),"It isn't the easyest game ever but it sure is fun. Metroid prime (the boss) is pretty tough, but in hard mode cloaked pirates are a pain until you get the plasma beam and thermal visor. If you want a good chalenge get this game, you might want to start off with a easier game if you just got a gamecube,but after that get it over all this is a solid game it deservs a 10/10"
5,Spectacular,"This game is a masterpiece. One of the best Gamecube games ever made. Great plot, beautiful graphics, and amazing gameplay. Any Gamecube owner should own this game at one time or another. I beat it a long time ago and am anxiously awaiting the release of Metroid Prime 2: Echoes."
2,boring and repetitive,"Everyone seems to love this game. We have Metroid Prime for the game cube, and all I can say is ""yawn"". The game is boring, repetitive. It mostly involves shooting buttons, beating lame bosses, and simple minded 3d mazes and space corridors remniscent of half-life on PC with less scripting. It might appeal to small-minded teens or as a rental, but I think this is one of the worst game cube games. The others must be looking at the game boy advance game, or something else ..."
1,THIS IS THE WORST GAME EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"THIS GAME SUCKS &*@#!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! First of all, THIS GAME IS SO HARD!!!!!!!!!!!!!! it sucks! I cant even get through the first level without getting stuck 5,000,000,000,000,000,000 times!!!!!!!!!! DON'T BUY THIS *!$*&#* $!& GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Don't have Gameboy Advance?,"I just bought this game used... I like this game, but when I found out you need Gameboy Advance just to play the original Metroid (and yes, you play the NES version of Metroid on your Gamecube, so I have no idea why you need the Gameboy Advance!) I nearly took this game back along with the Gamecube, which I am thinking very strongly about! Nintendo is pulling a Bill Gates and making you buy this and that for you to play extras! EXTRAS! On PS2 all the extras are included ON THE PS2! On Gamecube, you have to purchase a Gameboy Advance at practically the same price you bought the Gamecube for just to play extras! This is totally a disservice by Nintendo and I am not buying anything from that company ever again. I wanted to give this zero stars, but Amazon.com is too lenient on things that deserve to be tossed in the fire!"
1,NOT RELEASED YET!,Ok how can you rate a game thats not even out yet? HELLLOOO!!!Heh the gamecube isnt any good anyway.
4,Really good metroid game,"This game is very fun to play if u like shooting adventure games.Its one of the best. All the sweet weapons are there, so u wont miss a thing. The only draw back 4 me is the 1st person mode.I dont really like that but if u curl into a ball its 3rd person. (-: If u like this stuff buy it. (-:"
5,Awesome,"I have played the metroid series my whole life and i have to say that Metroid Prime is the best game ever! Even though i like it i do realize that some people are too impatient with certain games like metroid prime and won't play it if it is to hard, and i respect that. If you aren't too impatient with video games then buy this!"
5,The game for GameCube,"I got this game second-hand after having the GameCube for about 6 months and wish I had got it muuucccccchhhhh sooner. This game is for the thinking gamer. The teen rating is for violence but I've seen more violence from the everyone rated Sly Cooper & the Thievious Raccoonus for PS2. One reason that it also may have been rated teen is that you can scan your enemies (which is awsome by the way) and sometimes it will tell you disgusting things about them. For example, they have already been hurt and to kill it you need to sever the spinal cord. Say what you want about the GameCube being for the little kids but you done get this from the PS2."
4,HALO has a new Opponet Metroid Prime,Halo Was the best game for the XBOX now thatMetroid Prime is out Halo has an opponet With Better graphics and great effects Halo has someone to Compete This games is very realistic you feel like you are SAMOUS and this game is very Challangeing. If you want HALO but you have no XBOX get this game
5,Awesome!,"This is my third time entering the Metroid universe, and this is by far the best! Great graphics, awesome unlockables, and intricate puzzles make this quite possibly the best FPS yet! The music is awesome, too, except for fighting the Chozo Ghosts, which is music on par with the muzak you hear while on hold with most major companies.BTW, I am assuming that the game is too hard for the other reviewers, assuming none of them can spell."
2,"I rented this game, and was dissapointed","I rented this game from blockbuster. Then I started to play. The game started out OK but then started to drop in intrest. This game got boring fast, and I returned the stupid thing early it was so bad! My advise, get Golden Sun for GBA, Wind Waker for GC, or FFX for PS2."
3,not so good!,"i hate to say this, but this game is over-rated. what i mean is that this game has difficult controls. i have only gotten to the very first part of the game, but i was frustrated enough to write this review. it may or may not be an accurate review of this game, but from what i have read of other reviews is that this game is difficult. and ya know this is supposed to be one of the better titles for the game cube, the cube really suffers from sub-standard titles. i will give is game another shot, but i hate when i buy games and have to spend a lot of time trying to figure them out, that takes a lot away from the game. i really don't like to buy strategy guides, but for this one i think i might have to pick one up, or thumb through one at the store for some tips. sorry metroid fans, but this game isn't all that it is cracked up to be."
1,"Not really a Metroid game, technically.","I'm only giving this game 1 star because I don't like First Person Shooters. And that's all this game is. If you already know you don't like playing FPS games, don't bother trying it.I say it's not Metroid because a game in a franchise should be at least slightly comparable to the FEEL of the previous games.Side-Scrolling Mario (or Zelda) going to Third-Person 3D Mario (or Zelda) is still okay. It's close enough to the feel for you to get used to it. It still FEELS like Mario (or Zelda).I'm sure this is an incredible example of an FPS game; the music is incredible, the graphics are gorgeous. But it is NOT a Metroid game. It doesn't FEEL like a Metroid game. Oh well."
1,Stupid game,They come up with a boss right in the middle of the game that's damn impossible. (Thardus) What the #@% were those dumb game designers thinking ?????
5,"My, my what a GREAT GAME !!!! A MUST HAVE FOR ANY GC OWNER","Do not hesitate to buy this Great and terrific game. If you own a Nintendo Gamecube you MUST have this game. This game has one ( if not the only one ) of the most detailed environments that you can ever encounter on any game. Everything is super detailed and what is amazing is that everything takes place in only one world !! Everything is carefully detailed ( enemies, trees, water, rain, ice, lava, mines, etc, etc.) C'mon go ahead, go and buy one for yourself you truly deserve it, or if you don't get it you will be missing one of the BEST games the GC has yet to offer."
5,Best Gamcube Game To Date,"This is absolutly the best game i have ever played. From the first moment you step on to frigate in orbit around tallon IV, to the very end, this is one great buy. The visuals are perfect an the backrounds are not pre-rendured. The game sounds great and you soon learn what enemies you'll fight, even if you are far from it. This game can be played over and over again until you find the last power-up pure fun. The only problem is the gameplay. But even the game perfects its self by setting you in the first level, whitch is a huge tutorial with less reading and more playing. This is by far the best game you can by for the Nintendo Gamecube!! Good job Retro/Nintendo!..."
5,Metroid Prime,This was the most anticipated title of 2002. The story of Samus taking down the Space Pirates in a 3-D world is amazing. The Graphics about and is called by EGM better than Halo. The story starts out after Metroid I for the Nes and before Metroid II. This game is not a first person shooter by any means this game is very much an adventure with many puzzles and big impressive bosses. This game can get very intense. Highly recomended by a big Metroid Fan!
4,One of the best - EVER!!,"Metroid Prime is one of the best video games ever made. Why? You want hot graphics? How about 60 fps of highly textured, multi-polygonal, expansive worlds and creatures. You want awesome sound? All I've got to say: Dolby Digitial Surround II. Tight controls? Get a few hours in, and playing is as second nature as breathing. Throw in a solid story, engrossing history, and one of the most sought after video game hero's of all time, and you've got Metrod prime. If you own a Gamecube, there is no reason why you don't own this game."
2,Too hard,"This game, particularly near the end, is far too difficult. I finally had to give up and get back to real life after many hours attempting to defeat the final enemy (""Metroid Prime""). Some of the earlier battles had been exceedingly difficult as well and required many hours of play. After a certain amount of this the game begins to feel more and more like a chore and less and less like a game. While gamers with very nimble fingers and reflexes or a great deal of free time may enjoy this type of challenge I did not. I noticed that others have written with similar opinions. I feel this is a critical flaw in the game and do not recommend it despite its positive qualities."
4,Is it really the best game ever made?,"While the game starts out with a bang, it gets kind of boring and repeditive in the middle, but like all Metroid games, everything always explodes near the end, and that's what gamers always anticipate. Perhaps it's not the abseloute greatest game ever made, but it's still a good game that every GameCube owner should take for a spin at least once."
5,Metroid Prime lives up to its past reputation,"Metroid proved to be a great game just like all of the gameboy games were a big hit. This game has great graphics with extraordinary gameplay, making it a must buy on your game list."
5,The only reason I'd buy a Game Cube,"Frankly, I am sorely disappointed with the Game Cube, and am thankful that I haven't purchased one. Metroid Prime is the only reason that I would ever consider purchasing one and I really hope that Xbox buys the rights to make the next game. That said, I loved just about every aspect of this game. It was both long enough and pretty enough to hold my attention. The HUD is the best I've ever seen and I would love to see another game utilize it."
3,Dizzy!,If you play this game for longer than 2 hours you start to feel sick because of the way the camera angles work. It's a fantastic game and one of the best out there but play it in short spells.
3,good mats but could use some modification,i love dodge which is why i got these floor mats but they dont have any tacs on the back side so they slide around on the carpet and get scrunched up.
1,Huge disappointment,"On the strength of ""I'd like to change the world"" I purchased he anthology of Ten Years After, only to discover that it was the only song worth owning. Good ""rock-a-billy guitar work if you like that kind'a thing. I don't. It's the same riff over and over. The lyrics are terrible."
5,Great Book!,"Very cute, original story. Some French words which are nice. My kids, ages 4 and 6, really loved this story."
5,Being in Love: The Practice of Christian Prayer,"I've only begun to read it and I see it's potential of having great impact in my spiritual walk, translating to my experiential walk in this life as well."
1,Money! Give us money!!,"Unbeliavable. Iron Maiden is behaving like an authentic ""dinosaur"" band, when they did not need to act like that, because they're still in top form.Now, besides an endless stream of live albums, DVD's and compilations, they release a DVD (double) featuring videos released along the years to promote their albums or singles. Man, what for??? Why on Earth would I buy a collection of VIDEOS, featuring the version of the sonsg that are on the cd's??!!Well, I think the die hard fans will love it. I won't. (and I'm a big fan)"
4,must have for iron maiden`s fan - video collectins 1980-2001,"must have for iron maidens fan - 5 stars for them.the sound is dolby digital 2.0 ( only brave new world and fear of the dark videos from "" rock in rio"" both feature 5.1 dolby digital) video collections from 1980-2001 all original sound.many of the songs filmed on tour or during tour , for of them are real live. hallwed be thy name filmed at donington august 1992 is great track. the other tracks filmed at studios. 35 tracks included the hidden tracks . enjoy the video history of iron maidens clips and the pictures between the tracks.i find it only 4 stars."
2,The mighty are sometimes greedy...,"I gave up supporting Iron Maiden (by ""supporting"" I mean buying their products) around 1990, when Steve Harris replaced the great Adrian Smith wih one of the worst British guitarrists I've ever listened to, Mr. Janick Gers. Maybe he's good, but he was not fit for Iron Maiden, because the guitar solos in Iron Maiden are (were, whatever) a very important part of the songs, and Janick just can't play Adrian Smith solos (or any kind of solo, for that matter - check the good TATTOED MILLIONAIRE, a solid rock album by Bruce Dickinson featuring Janick - there's no solo - just a brief one in the tittle track). So, he destroyed all the former solos dancing, jumping, falling, instead of PLAYING them...Also, Steve Harris became to take complete control, reaching the level of production - sad decision.SO, I prefer not to enrich them by buying a compilation of videos (?). I'll just wait for DANCE OF DEATH (I'll check it before deciding to bbuy it or not)."
3,Mixed Methodology Combining Qualitiative and Quantitative Approaches,"Too little for too much! As a graduate student trying to complete the course work for my PhD in curriculum and instruction, and having to spend money on tuition and books, the price of this book is outrageous. Considering I have to work 7 and 1/2 hours to make $70.00, the information given in less than 200 pages is not worth more than half a day's salary. I think I could better appreciate what the authors are saying if it were at a lower cost."
3,Very eclectic mix of sounds,"Ghostland combines some traditional rock instruments with some very non-traditional to create a unique, entrancing sound. Celtic, middle eastern, dance beats, orchestral movements and emotional vocals all blend together. Most of the songs, they blend seamlessly. There are a few where the style doesn't work, but overall this is a very unique and enjoyable CD"
3,Good but commercial,Good but commercial:This Album is definitely worth some attention but it remains very `commercial'. Usually this takes away from the originality of the sound and this album is no exception to this rule. In other words you get tired of it more quickly than usual.
4,The transitional sound of DC,"This album has the same keyboard qualities of DC's other EP that came out at the same time, ""So Impossible."" The differences being that this material is from the first album and the other was all new stuff at the time. Summers Kiss really shows the transitional sound between ""The Places..."" and ""A Mark..."" while foreshadowing that Dashboard would be going in a more electric direction on the last track ""Ender Will Save Us All."" This provides a partial remedy for the people who wish that Chris would've done an alternate version of the first album with a full band. Giving us four more tracks. The highlight of the collection for me is ""Living In Your Letters"" which far eclipses the emotional impact of the acoustic version, if only because of the vocal performance. My beef with it is that there isn't a version of ""A Plain Morning"" which was a track that truly stood out from the pack on the first album. I hope that he will do that down the road."
1,your support,"This EP is nothing special. The packaging is very similar to his last EP. They could have changed it around a little. Why can't he write more new songs? Isn't there some time between touring and having 16 year old girls swoon over him. Dashboard Confessional is donating all the procedes from this cd to the terroritsts. If you support Dashboard, you support terrorism."
2,Selling Out,"This cd is over produced, and it deviates from what made Dashboard so wonderful in the first place. What's more--these songs are all remakes off of the brilliant record, the Swiss Army Romance, which is much much better. Come on...slowed down and drums? Dashboard was Chris and his guitar. This is depressing. If this release is your favorite by Dashboard, you are not a true fan.If you want a good EP, get the Drowning one!!!"
2,Blah,"Too much ""studio magic"" was used. Chris' voice was cleaned up and it just doesnt sound right. The words soud forced, most likley because Chris is trying to keep time with the drummer. If the songs werent well written to begin with i would have rated this a 1/5...Stick to ""The Swiss Army Romance"""
2,Maybe I am just a purist,"Ok, the songs aren't totally bad...but, if you are a fan of Swiss Army Romance and the Drowning EP, as in old Dashboard, this cd is defnintely not worth it. These songs are merely old ones off of Swiss Army, rerecorded w/ more instruments. In other words, they are defnintely leaning toward pop, and that makes me sad. So if you are a purist like me...this cd is rather depressing. But if you like the new Dashboard, have at it."
3,"Nice, not worth buying...","This is a nice little EP, although nothing exciting for anybody who's been a fan since ""Swiss Army Romance"". The songs sound nice re-recorded with drums and bass, but there's nothing exciting or interesting about it...although the electric guittar was a nice surprise.If you own the first Dashboard LP, don't bother buying this one. I personally like the songs better with just a guittar. Spend your money on the ""So Impossible"" ep if you dont have it already..."
1,emotionally lacking,"I love these songs...when they were on 'Swiss Army Romance' I remember when I went to saw the last tour, how my heart just dropped when he picked up the electric gutiar. It's not the same, but I don't blame Chris for all this. Instead I choose to believe that this is a result of Vagrant Records. Drive-Thru let him do it his way with 'Swiss Army'. The band wasn't around until he signed with Vagrant. So stop blaming Chris for all this, it's all probably just contract requirements."
4,Berlioz Finest Soloist-Choral Work,"You will find in this book a very thorough writing of this magic 19th century masterpiece. The text is in both German (the original Goethe's) and French and all the Hector Berlioz indications are written down (French only). As nothing can be perfect it lacks at many pages the indication of which instrument is playing, although you can figure out who they are when you are reading music you have no time for this."
1,A big waste of time,"The author summarizes the plots of about a dozen violent movies, then he summarizes the critics' reaction to those movies. That's about it. The interview with Oliver Stone is pointless. If you want to read a really good book on this subject, try The Blood Poets by Jake Horsley."
2,Simply Not That Great,"I read other people's reviews for this book and thought I would find it very interesting and engaging. I have read a wide variety of other books either about the Holocaust or at least touch upon the subject, and this one just isn't very good. I didn't like any of the characters and only some of the stories have any potential to make me smile, laugh or think very deeply. This is one of those books that is short, so it's easy to read, but the only reason I couldn't put it down is because I was painfully hoping that at some point, it would get better. I read a lot of books and while this one is okay, overall, I would recommend to skip it."
4,Best controller,This is the absolutly the best controller for gamecube. It has:turbowirelssprogrammableminiSo I reccomend this to evryone out there.
1,Does not live up to expert's standards,"The Mini Wireless controller is so frustrating because it keeps shutting off. There is a turbo button on it that flicks on and off and if it's not on, the controller won't work. Mid-game the turbo button shuts off and your player freezes and the other guy wins. If your the kind of person who loves to lose and get very frustrated this is for you. If not, buy the regular sized wireless Wavebird controller instead. It works GREAT."
1,poor performance,"The wireless game cube controller constantly loses connection with the game cube. Thus, the controller will essentially shut off during a game. I do not recommend it."
2,Least durable wireless controllers,"I have a lot of controllers for various consoles. Microsoft, Logitech, even a Nintendo WaveBird. I got these for the rumble, and they had a cheap look to them from the start, but they worked fine--for a while. I have two of them and both have started falling apart, and one is unusable because the ""A"" button is stuck in the depressed position. I have e-mailed Intec to see if they will do anything, but I'm not holding my breath."
3,Gamecube Controller for your little gamers...,"My daughter loves this. It's small and fits her hands very well. It's wireless and even has rumble features. The only problem is that it hangs up from time to time and needs to be reset every so often, which is annoying but in this case the pros outweigh the cons. Would I buy again? probably because it's affordable and there are no better options I've found."
4,wireless controller is pretty good,"This controller is perfect for little hands, not mention for those who can't help but trip over the controller cables, but is a little awkward for bigger hands."
5,"unusual blend of rock, but great to listen too","First time I ever heard of them, they were known as [minus] but I suppose since there was already a band with that name, they changed it to this. It was hard to find anything on them and I didn't even know this EP came out today- I just happened to see it. I heard them before and I still have their song downloaded ""Hesitant and Polite""..an awesome, lengthy and VERY original song. I almost picked up a CD by this band called minus..I'm glad I did not cuz it was the wrong band. The only way I really knew that minus.driver was THE band I was looking for was because their lead singer is African-American. Any Afro-American rocker rules because they chose rock over rap and blues. This is something worth buying..I hope they get into the mainstream to stay around..the best off this EP is ""sure thing"". Ultimately, ""hesitant and polite"" is the best of all."
2,YEA RIGHT!,"Please do NOT listen to this person.....this is absolutely nothing new...neither the sound or the style! If you want generic, then this is for you!"
5,Genius,The guy's from [minus.driver] will never fail to bring diversity to your music collection. Fans of any kind of rock will fall in love with this EP.
5,A Wonderful Story!!,"Mr. Sidle has used his words and ideas to write an outstanding book for children of any age. It is a classic bedtime story. My younger siblings Must have it read to them everynight before bed! They will not go to bed without hearing the Murphy Dog stories!I think that Mr. Sidle is a very powerful storyteller, expressing values that all should have through the story of a dog's life. His discussions include self-esteem and self-worth - topics many young children should hear more of.I think anyone and everyone should read Murphy Dog at the Circus!"
3,just another goa cd,"There's nothing special about this one, just another generic goa cd. I happen to like MWNN's older CDs but it looks like he's run out of inspiration. Unlike Astral Projection, Infected Mushroom, X-Dream and the like this one has no flavor."
5,An Awesome book to start on!,"When I first borrowed this book from the library, I thought, Hey, It Looks OK. I'll Borrow It. I read the book that night and WOW! There's thing's you should know about your writing spot, a quiz to help start you in a good genre, personally for you, and even real stories about young writers you've made it. This is such a good book to buy or at least read and take notes off of."
2,Not what I expected,"This book is supposed to help writers get started, and hopefully published. This book is gauged for children, inside of the book they have interviewed several writers, most of them children, and the information was short and confusing. If a child was to read this and understand some the issues covered and managed to get something accomplished with this book as their only aide, then they have my respect. I do NOT recommend this book if you are seeking information on publishers, and how to's on your manuscript. If you seriously want to read it try to borrow one. It's not worth the money I spent on on the book and shipping."
2,"Skip the album, just get Good Talk","I bought this album because I heard the track ""Good Talk"" on Smallville. Usually I am pleasantly surprised by somewhat unknown artists in these types of situations, but not really this time. The best track on the album is Good Talk, I wish I had just downloaded the song instead of buying the whole album."
1,plagio de una buena idea,"Me resulta inaceptable que se tome el nombre de una obra tan excelsa como de nuestra amada compatriota Conny Mendez para asignársela a un supuesto libro del amado Saint Germain que, con todo respeto, no escribió.Obviamente se trata de una maniobra comercial que no debe tener ningún tipo de apoyo de quien sea serio en su búsqueda espiritual.Puede que el material contenido en este libro sea bueno, pero se desmerita toda bondad que pueda tener al teñirlo con el tinte del plagio."
4,Moonlight Madness,"Look For Me By Moonlight is definitely a page-turner, although really very strange.(And Mary Hahn looks so normal!!)A teenaged girl, living in a dark, spooky inn on a dark spooky hill surrounded by snowstorms, falls for an enchanting dark-haired stranger whom comes to stay.She cannot keep away from him until he reveals himself to be the loathsome and menacing creature that he is.From the start, I found him creepy and I know I would never have fallen for him, even though some reviewers still think he is a hotty of some sort.Ewww..(Lol)"
5,Look For Me By Moonlight,"This book comes in at a close second for the title of my favorite book (that spot is held for Harry Potter and I think it always will be). Throughout the book, as it was so amazingly written, I felt all that Cynda did. Though I knew that Vincent was evil from the start, my suspitions grew weak as the plot thickened and Cynda's affections for him grew. His true identity was a complete surprise to me. I finished the book yesterday, but with every thought, it still lingers in my mind. This book was so powerful to me. I recommend it to anyone who knows how to read."
3,This book was a little disappointing yet suspenseful.,"This book was recommended to me by a friend. She made it seem really good so i was quite excitied to open the book and start to read it. The first was good but as i read on, I found it to be extremely far fetched with no logic. It was too unreal. I know it probably wasn't meant to be realistic but i think there could have been a little more truth to the story. This was the first book by Mary Downing Hahn that I have read so I don't mean to put her down, this may be just her style of writing. She may have better stories. I guess I'll just have to read some other books by this author."
4,Just Ok,"I'm a huge fan of vampire literature, so naturally I was excited when I started the book. It has some really good parts, but there's an odd aura about it that I can't explain. Definitely not your typical vampire story. Whether that's a good thing or not is up to you!"
3,An okay book...,i read anybook i can get my hands on about vampires...this one was recommended by my friend...so many things i loved...the characters...their names in particular...the over lined plot although i found it was very predictable and i dragged on for so long i began to get a little bored with it.i pressed on and then i was a little disapointed with the very end as well.although i would most likely recommend to those only with patience and a love for magick and vampires.
4,GREAT BOOK,"I found this book great and very understandable compared to many other horror mystery books I have read. I just finished reading it, and found it great to read.It actually gave me chills at some points. All this felt to real.GREAT BOOK, Mary D Hahn"
1,No thank you...,I can't say I'm a fan of this book. It felt like I was reading a novel about pedophilia. A 15-year-old girl falls in love with a 30-something-year-old man? No thank you. The ending was also very rushed. It seemed like the writer was as anxious to get the book over with as I was.
3,Not Half Bad,I know this book is aimed at readers younger then I (Im almost 24) but I loved the story so much. I will admit I was dissapointed twords the end of the book because it wasnt what I was expecting. I was expecting a run of the mill romance story between a mortal and a vampire but boy was I wrong. I was sad at the end when the vampires true intentions became known to the reader - I was really looking for a happy (fantasy romance) ending but thats not what I got. The book was still worth reading though and I kept my copy to read again in the future. If your looking for a happy ending where the two end up together then dont read this book. If your up for the unhappy ending to the romance but a still happy ending for the girl then pick this one up. I read it in one sitting so it definatly wasnt boring!
4,look for me by moonlight,"I thought this was a great book!!! I am a very talented reader and would say that even if you're not that great at reading books, or just don't enjoyreading, you should still read this book. More girls than boys will enjoy this book."
1,*crinkles her nose in disgust*,"Ok, that was bad... that was really really bad. I was expecting something along the lines of ""The Silver Kiss"" by Anette Curtis Klaus, because it was linked to that book ""people who bought ____ also bought ____"" But this is no where near the same level of reading or the same entertainment value. I was very unimpressed."
2,"Good message, Bad book","I like thought prvoking novels that make you go ""Well what if we did..."" and I thought this was going to be one of those. But it wasn't. It was a Draculaesque novel that gives out a clear, good, message about teens falling for older, in this case much, much older, guys who are being way seductive. A rare miss by Mrs. Hahn."
5,I think this is the best book by Maary Downing Hahn,"I thought this book Look for by Moonlight was one of Mary Downing Hahns best book! Even though I think all her books were great! I love Mary Dowing Hahn she is great writer and her books especially Look for me by Moonlight was really inspiring to me, her books inspired me to write!"
4,Ashley's review for Look for Me By Moonlight,Cynda's mother and father get a divorce and her father moves away and gets remarried to a student in one of his classes and soon has a new son named Todd.

5,chigaco tribune review,"""A bold, passionate tale of fanaticism and seduction. Sensitively and vividly rendered. Exotic, mythic, a tale told by a Sheherazade...parts of the tale told on different nights, each fascinating in its own right, each contributing to the story but also telling more than the story needs. Nahai lays her story of a strange folk and the enigma of charisma against a background rich in hisotry. 'Sunday's Silence' is an ambitious and entertaining novel that will please fans of Nahai's novels. It could also win her new readers."""
5,"Economic, but amazing!","I've had this exact model MP3 player for several years, and I wouldn't want anything else. 5gb of storage space is sufficient for my needs. It supports WMA or MP3 formats, and is fully compatible with Windows Media Player 11 and a USB 2.0 connection.The device itself has proven very hardy. Despite numerous falls, it still works perfectly. I've used it in weather of about 40F with no noticeable lack of battery life. I have never had it freeze up or fail in any way. No complaints about it at all. I wouldn't want anything else, really."
2,Ceiling Fan Receiver,"I purchased this receiver because their web site said it was a replacement for the model 375 which I have but which no longer works. Well, this new model (105) is not compatible with the old transmitter at all, so I can not use it. I put it in a junk drawer in my garage. This whole thing was pretty disappointing."
3,Mezzaluna Board,"I love the Wusthof knives, so thought that I would try the Mezzaluna, I honestly don't chop fresh herbs and spices very often, but had to have it anyway. I also bought the Mezzaluna board that the Mezzaluna works better with, from Amazon.com. I love Amazon.com, and buy most of everything that I want and need from them. I also have found better prices here, plus items that I have not been able to find other places. kcherokee4@yahoo.com"
3,Save Your $25 If You Want In-Depth Science...,"Although the general subject matter of this video is interesting if you are in to theoretical physics and metaphysical mysticism, the depth of the ""science"" in this video is relatively shallow. I hoped for in-depth insights into physics and metaphysical reality but got material I could have read on the internet for free or in other material. The scientific studies cited are interesting, but the video glossed over them at a high level and much of the time in the video was wasted watching the host standing in front of an audience waiting for the audience to perform discussion exercises. This video is for people who are new to ""new paradigm science"" and new-age philosophy. Save your $25 if you are looking for in-depth revolutionary science."
1,Nonlocality? Nongood !,"In a search for scientific information I put out $25.00. All I got was a poorly shot film with a boring teacher who should have stayed teaching elementary school. On second thought, the students are better off without this guy. I highly recomend you pass this stinker by."
2,whoa!,"These are adorable pumps, it's too bad I couldn't even put my foot down to walk in them. The heel is much too long."
3,Shoes...are small.,"I love the shoes, I do. they ran small, so I had to send them back...but they processed my refund quickly without problem. Order up on the size....but definitely still order."
3,511-Safari,Para ser talla seis (6) la horma del zapato es muy pequeña y en realidad parecen unos cinco (5) o inclusive cuatro (4).De resto todo OK.
2,Narrow,"Really nice stilettos but extremely narrow.. didn't fit at all, definitely not a good experience!"
2,Had to return these boots,"Boots were a great fit and very nice leather construction but unfortunately I had to return them because some of the nails used to attach the soles had crooked heads and did not fit flush to the sole. This defect caused several scratches to my wood floor before I noticed the problem. I have another pair of the 10 inch field boots and could not be happier with them. They cost about $60 more, but are well worth the extra cost. I guess you get what you pay for. The boots I returned were $88.95."
5,Messenger Rocks!,"A blue sky above and a sea whose majestic undulations shimmer like green velvet covered with diamonds. A coastal winding road with Julia Messenger emphasising each curve and creation of the black top as the world is replaced with a ballet of sight and sound. Clutch, brake, left hand down, counter, throttle, dancing metal to the beat of Julia Messenger will leave you touched, moved and inspired. Messenger rocks. Get it, breathe it, live your possibility!"
1,The ultimate self-love is self-abasement,"There is a certain pose in these poems, and it is quite effective as poses go, but Buddhism is not a pose, nor a cloak for anger, nor a disguise for preening, and these well-made poems have a hollow core as if the empty kettle had belched. Sorry. I had really wanted to like it."
4,Good,"I liked the product very much. Non greasy texture, moisturizes your skin. Helps keeping pores clear. I still have black heads, but they are definitely smaller. Now remember there's no miracle cream, don't expect clear pores from day 1.... you need to be consistent with your skin care."
1,Too many parabens!,I'm so sick of companies charging an arm and leg for products that irritate your face and put several crap ingredients in them.
2,Awful..,If you have sensitive skin dont use this! It broke me out terribly and it didnt help with my pores AT ALL.
1,cd won't play,"I have ordered this cd from 3 differnet businesses, including Amazon. None of them will play. None look the same as the case in the photo. The jewel box has no insert, just some black lettering on a white disk. I still want the cd, but I don't know how to find a ""real"" one."
4,Pretty nice for the price,This is an impressive kids costume when combined with the torch - pretty realistic. Only problem we had was the elastic badn on the crown broke so we have to rig something up to make it work.
1,Not what it seems,"This tape is an edited version of the episode.It does not contain the weekend update with JessieJackson reciting ""Green Eggs and Ham"".The tape is app. 25 minutes in length.Othe than that typical SNL."
5,Great Jazz!,"This is a terrific CD full of great standards. The arrangements are wonderful and, of course, the vocals are amazing. I especially recommend the version of ""Someone To Watch Over Me"" which features Rick's daughter, Dianne-Romelle Fay on vocals. Without a doubt, this talented singer should be releasing CDs on her own - what an amazing voice!"
4,"Nice -- but check out his other stuff, too.","The ""with strings"" threw me off; I'm not used to Rick's music in that setting. But: This is good stuff! Standard tunes, played well, good charts. . . and one very nice vocal piece. Terrific that his daughter got to sing with him before his death last year. Also terrific to see that she has her own chops too; carrying on family traditions is a good thing. All told: Good work on everybody's part in this disc."
1,disappointed,"I will be returning this book. I should have read the reviews before buying because one reviewer described what I just discovered with the arrival of ""Knives and Razors."" It is a huge, detailed encyclopedia of Case (307 pages), with a bone-thrown to Queen/Shatt & Morgan (84 pages), and Remington (86 pages). It is advertised as an all-encompassing guide to American knives. It is not, although Case collectors will love its focus/detail.I collect vintage knives, mostly the Texas toothpick pattern, but not Case. An incomplete list of manufacturers in my collection includes Parker, Buck, Ka-Bar, Shrade, Robeson, Hammer Brand, Imperial, Camillus, Winchester, Smith & Wesson, Smokey Mountain, A.G. Russell. NONE of these brands are given a word in the ""American Premium Guide to Knives and Razors."""
3,KNIVES & RAZORS ID AND VALUE GUIDE,I bought this book for my father-in-law who is a big collector of knives and razors. He informed me that it was alright but it now does not cover Remington Bullet Knives (the antique ones). It covers only the reproduction Remington Bullet Knives. So I now need to find an up to date value guide that covers the Remington Knives like this one use to do.
1,Poor excuse for a Guide,"The first thing to notice is a lack of an index. Why call something a guide if you don't provide a way to find information? The book, called an Identification and Value Guide covers only four brands of knives. It would better be called an extensive look at Case Knives and short look at a few others. If you are looking for a general guide for collecting knives, there must be better books available."
1,Never got the magazine,I once subscribe for this magazine through Amazon and never recieve it. I love this magazine so I now buy it in my nearest library.
5,My favorite magazine,"This is the best magazine I've read lately. It is still new, and I've only received 4 issues, but read each cover to cover, finding each article fascinating, and very accessible (unlike the parent publication, which is occasionally over my head.) It may be just because I like the subject matter - but it seems to me these are subjects which would interest most people. Some recent articles (as of Oct. 2005) included why we lie, the meaning of dreams, the nature of consciousness, what causes creativitity, what is deja vu. It is one subscription which is well worth the money. The only drawback I've found is that it is quarterly - sometimes it seems like a long wait between issues."
3,Could be much better,"I've been subscribing to SciAm Mind for about a year now and have been reading it at the bookstore for a couple of years. I'm a layperson, no medical training or professional background in dealing with these topics, I just have a personal interest.While I enjoy a good bit of the magazine, I typically find myself frustrated at how it seems as though they only have a few people submitting articles. Unfortunately I don't have a copy on hand, but there's one guy (?) with a name that's about a mile long, and by the time I've finished the magazine, I'm sick of seeing his name and reading his often less-than-thrilling diatribes.I'll likely continue subscribing to SciAm Mind because I do feel like I get something out of it, but Psychology Today is definitely my preferred of the two."
3,Not Necessarily for Neuroscientists,"Each issue of this magazine covers very interesting topics in psychology and neuroscience, though it is by no means ""Science"". I expected the depth of the articles to be along the lines of Scientific American, its parent publication, and I am occasionally disappointed by the superficiality of some of the content.Nonetheless, I find this magazine to address fascinating questions concerning the mind and to be very accessible if you do not have a background in the sciences. With that said though, if you are a neuroscientist, you may find ""Nature Neuroscience"" to be more satisfying."
2,"Should be called ""Scientific American Brain""","This is less about the ""mind"" and more about the brain, as far as I'm concerned. There is lots of biological science (some of it questionable) and a lot less psychology. It seems very focused on finding biological causes for emotional or psychological states which I feel is narrow and only half the story."
2,Disappointed doesn't begin to describe it,Not nearly up to the standards of Scientific American in terms of science or the conclusions drawn by sometimes flawed studies -- or by flawed writing. Difficult to tell which. I won't be renewing.
5,I love Scientific American Mind,"This is definitely my favorite magazine. I work in the field of Psychology, and find that this magazine describes a lot of psychological ideas in a fun and easy to follow way. It also frequently highlights new developments in the field and has features by top psychology researchers.All in all I highly recommend it."
4,Engaging but shallow,"This is a good way to get interested in a subject but could be far more in depth. I'd prefer fewer shallow articles and more meat to the story. Oh well, at least it gets me interested enough to google more on various subjects."
4,Every Article Fascinating,Anyone interested in how the mind works can't help but be fascinated by nearly every article in each issue.
1,bad,"I can't agree with the favorable feedback. Each time I buy an issue, I wish I could get my money back. This is not the level expected from Scientific American. I buy it because I can't follow the scientific literature of the mind field, but even with my limited knowledge I find most of the article missing, superficial, logically incoherent, and too infested with psychobabble. If you are interested with intelligent discussions that by no mean represent the latest, full picure of the field, Psychology Today is more the way to go."
1,It's gotta get better,"I just finished reading the October 2007 article called Brain Stains. You've got to be kidding. There is NO substantiating material on any of this 'false memory' stuff in this article. In fact, this case was apparently dismissed. Therapists are a hard working bunch of people who are taking the rap for things that do not exist. If this magazine wants to make it with 'people in the know' they are going to have to go back and do some better journalizing. This is what I refer to as sensationalistic presentation. Get your facts straight. This is the 21st century and people are more aware of the need to provide out right proof. I may just read your magazine to let people know that you're shamming them.Shamai Currim Phd"
5,Classic Miles,"For the Serious Miles Collector, a must buy, maybe not the best sound, but still Classic Miles"
4,Moving Music,"I first heard this while shopping and by the time I had reached the rear of the store I was dancing in the aisles. It is a bit uneven but I defy anyone to sit still through tracks 3,4&5. - Beautiful music to move to - Give yourself a treat and enjoy this unique album."
5,A stylish electronica/dance cd with all kind of styles,"Since the advent of the electronica very few band have managed to mix well all the different styles. D Genre succeed in making a cd that is fresh, a pleasure to hear and with all different styles of dance music. One of the best electronica/dance CD I have in my collection."
2,From a servant of Jesus,"I was not all that impressed by the information presented in the very few pages available for public viewing. Given such limited reading material, it is unfair to judge the quality of the whole book. Overall, from what I have read, it appeared to be a very expensive form of propaganda and rhetoric."
4,Good for easy reach!,"I'm using this diaper stacker for my baby's diaper and it's very handy I just hang it behind the door, easy to reach. I like it and it's very affordable, I don't need an expensive items for the diaper this one works for me I'm comfortable with this item."

4,Good FileMaker imitation,"I am not sure what MS hoped to accomplish with this version of Access, other than to make it easier for most Access users, who seem to use Access as a glorified Excel spreadsheet. Having developed in Access for many years, this major revision is a little off-putting. It looks just like FileMaker, which I personally dislike.That being said, it has all the basic functionality of the older versions, except with a very forced FileMaker interface that is hard to overcome. You can down-convert to mdb files, so that is a good feature. Otherwise, the most significant update is the menu ribbons, which are a pain to relearn, and the XML formatting, which remains to be seen if it will be useful in the Office environment. Since they are pushing SharePoint quite succesfully, I think this will pay off for MS in the long run, but otherwise, just be prepared to shell out some retraining dollars."
1,Disappointing Product,"You'd be better off using some real database software like Oracle or SQL Server. You can't do bulk column updates and Access is losing my data - so far, I've been pretty disappointed. Also, they changed the extensions of Access files from .mdb to .accdb - and now, VS.NET 2005 can't open the new Access 2007 files. I would have thought that Microsoft would make all their tools compatible - oh well, i'm disappointed, but you may like it."
1,What a nightmare!,"Access 2007 does basically the same as any other previous versions, but they changed the screen presentation, so now everything is either hiding or in other places. It is like having bought a different manufacturer's product. (In a car, now the brake pedal would be in the steering column and the light switch would be the accelerator....)I think I would have been better off downloading Open Office (for free.)Also, it is very expensive."
5,database,"great tool for office, business or whatever. learning it is difficult but worth every step. great amount of help at microsoft.com or buy tutorial books to go with this program."
5,Access 7,Arrived on time. installed easily. My daughter is now able to bring some of her work home from the office
2,"Access 2007, WARNING - this product is harmful to your productivity","The ribbon menu does not help usability in Access 2007, frequently leaving experienced users wasting time looking for a feature that they were familiar with in 2003. Generally the design layout is clumsy, taking too much time to deliver the desired results. Unless Microsoft address the user in Access 2010, I will be looking for a more user friendly product. Office Products should increase productivity, THIS WILL NOT."
5,Microsfot Access 2007,"I have found some useful Access databases on the Internet. One is a Nutrition calculator. Plug in the foods you eat through out the day and it will tell you how many total calories, Protein calories, Carb calories, and fat calories a person has consumed for the day. Some of the other databases are Contact, charitable contribution, Vehicle maintenance and Issue Tracking."
3,Hard to use and complicated.,I had to purchase this item for a college class I was taking. The software is difficult to use and complicated. I would say that other database programs are better in terms of use.I do like some of the integrated functions with other programs like Word and Excel.
1,MS Access,I am extremely disappointed with MS Access. About 18 years ago I used Borland's data base program called Reflex. It was heads and shouldersabove the Microsoft product. I had thought that things were supposedto get better not worse.
2,Music quality not good,"Although the music in itself was just what I was looking for, the quality of the recordings was disappointing. It sounds like an old record. I had expected better quality."
3,its ok ...,i was looking for more french coffe shop type .not what i expected.but its a oky cd.maybe some other pepole like this one.
4,"Eh, not so great.","Don't botherIf you are looking for true accordion & the flavor of France, don't waste time with this one."
5,Great gift for a golfing 49-er fan,I purchased this as a birthday gift for my husband.While he will probably not use the golf balls the towel looks nice on his bag and has worn well with use and several washings.Nice inexpensive gift for the 49-er fan.
1,Dead in Two Days,This drive lasted two days. Loaded my backups(approx 200GB)and did some retrieves. Everything okay. Next morning booted up and this drive reported as not formatted!!!!! On reboot to find out what the heck.......drive not reported in system and dead. DEAD DEAD DEAD in two days. Seems to be running hot. Maybe that is why they say they are quiet because they are DEAD. And Seagate doesn't even ask what the problem is when you go through the RMA process.......but hey they are QUIET! And my data is gone.
5,killer jam session man!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,When i was at this show i nearly passed out from the sound!!!!! It waS INTENSE!!!!!!!!!!!! This is the best show in the hisroty of the world. This beats out the civil war in intensity.KILLER KILLER JAM MY MAN
4,I like my banner,"I like my banner. I have it on the wall of my cubicle at the office, so I'm usually looking at it pretty closely. I only have two complaints:The quality is good, but I can see quite a few flaws in the stitching that annoy me. These wouldn't be noticeable from afar.My other complaint is the deep creases that came in the flag. I figured they would works themselves out after a while but, alas, they did not.I like my banner."
3,"Reasonable, no more","I would advise you to use this guide as a starting point. Though I am not as harsh in my criticism of the book as the previous reviewer, there are obvious weaknesses in the book. The lack of a rating system is one, for sure, though there are comprehensive descriptions which will enable you to form a view of the content. Riley does have his own standards, and in terms of production quality, those standards can be ridiculously high; his concept of feminine beauty is also an intensely personal one which readers of the guide may not share. As an avid viewer and collector of porn, I view this guide as a tool not as slavishly prescriptive of what I will enjoy - I know what I like, and Riley's guide can point me in certain direction, but whether I choose to follow his pointers or not is a matter for me."
1,UGH!,This episode is bad; Avoid this one. It's not as good as the more better X-Files episodes. Besides the plot seem like a 5-year old wrote it.The Worst Episode Ever!
4,kind of clever,just bought this and wanted to add my own dig it.Like the hippy hillbilly sound.whats not to dig for a nickle? 5 cent is almost theft in my mind.what say you?
3,Good cd,"This is a nice cd. They play a good hard rock and sometimes they change to balads. I can say it pays off.Here in my country (Brazil), we have never heard about Drive by Truckers. I listened to them by a friend and I like it."
5,the irony is unique,"I love this album, and one of the reasons is the irony in their music caught me completely off guard. I love to be surprised by music, and I love it when a band avoids the same old formulaic approaches. At first listen they come across like other alt-country bands, and musically they are (although they rock a little more than other twang bands) but listen closely, and then keep listening, and you'll discover that this is a truly SOUTHERN band with southern stories but NOT a country band with the typical transparent and glib stories country bands tell. I recommend this album to everyone I know and the rest of y'all too!"
5,Absolutely Amazing!!,"The lyrics, the melodies, everything about this album is nearly flawless. One of the greatest albums I have ever heard. The only problem is the amount that I listen to this. Buy this album and I guarantee you won't regret it. More rock than country. Absolutely amazing!!"
5,Another Amazing album...,"I absolutely loved Decoration Day, and I have to say, The Dirty South tops it without question in my book. This album is much tighter than Decoration Day, and it is easy to see how the song-writing and musicianship of these musicians have grown since DD. I loved all of the songs on this album, particularly ""Tornadoes"" and ""Goddamn Lonely Love"". As amazing as the songs are, you cannot forget about the artwork as well, I think that DBT have some of the most amazing and interesting artwork that I have ever seen. So yeah, if you want to hear an amazing balance of hard-hitting southern rock and just good old rock and roll, buy this album!"
3,Overall good but missing something??,"I was really turned on by the DBT album Decoration Day, so I was very much looking forward to this follow-up. It does build slowly, and the first few tracks take a few listens to appreciate (although the song about sounding like a train still gets on my nerves). At about track 7 the CD transforms into something far more lyrical and the stories become more engaging. I love the outlaw anti-glam approach to the story of Buford Pusser (how can that be a real name?). This is when DBT does what they do best--keeping you rapt with tales from individual perspectives.Although not as melodic or powerful as their last production, this CD is great entertainment on long car rides."
3,No new Decoration day!,"No, the DBT couldn't follow up the terrific Decoration Day. I must say that The dirty south Is'nt even near. David Barbe has produced this one too, but something Is missing here. The production Is cold, with a sort of hard-rock feel added to It. Johnny Neffs pedal-steel Is gone and so Is the twangy, alt. country slowburners that was so great on Decoration Day. There Is no new ""hits"" like Marry Me and Sink hole either.But there Is still some great songwriting here from Cooley/Hood and Isbell, So Im already lookin forward to next summer and a new DBT disc!"
5,top notch,"the best band you've never heard of...my first taste of DBT - will certainly be going back for seconds, thirds,...."
5,killer,"get this disc. a great album from start to finish. its has everything a classic album needs, hard rockers, great hooks, and a couple of slower tunes."
4,Purdy good...,"Saw these guys live a couple times. Picked up a few albums. This one is great. Best song on cd: ""Tornadoes."" Others that get rocked: ""The Buford Stick,"" ""Lookout Mountain."" I'd recommend some other Lost Highway releases over this one...these guys aren't the first ones to revive old school southern rock and mix it with some punk, although thier fans seem to think they have broken down some kind of wall. If you think this cd is good check out The Supersuckers MUST HAVE BEEN HIGH. (on SubPop)"
5,Fabulous Southern Rockers,"I bought Gangsterbilly because I had a store credit at est buy, and now am buying all DBT's music. Carl Perkins Cadillac is a great song, the rest of it is the other side of Walking Tall. Strongly recommend, sort of a cross between the Band and Lynyrd Skynard."
1,False Advertising,"The cash register does not actually print the information such as product on the receipt. It just puts numbers. If you look at the picture, it shows full text on the receipt."
4,Great machine! Only one complaint...,Only one complaint: the cover on the top comes right off when it's opened rather than staying with a hinge or a resting plate of some kind. Can be annoying. I've had to go around a few times and retrieve the lid from the floor after I've opened it to change a roll of paper or change the control switch. (can be several times per day)Otherwise it does a good job. More than enough departments and PLUs for my small business. :)
3,Works ok,"So far, the Zodiac flea collars work okay. They were thinner than I thought they were going to be. The question is: will they work the length of time stated? The true test is whether or not, within a 4 month period, the cats and I start performing a synchronized scratching routine at 3am."
3,spidey cupcakes,because of the white background the paper turns brown-ish and the rest of the pics on the paper aren't so visible.
3,The Vampire Radu Lives!,"This third installment in the Subspecies series is one of the better ones. As in the first two movies, the vampire Radu is trying to seduce his ""fledgling"" Michelle into his world. At the same time, Michelle's sister enlists the help of the local authorities to try to take Michelle from Radu's home. The movie is as comic-book like as its predecessors and at the end we once again think Radu has been vanquished as Michelle's sister races away from Radu's castle with her sister safely concealed from the sun in a body bag. You can move on to Subspecies 4 to see what happens next. I'd recommend this or any of the Subspecies films for diehard fans only."
3,good,"this is a good vampire movie. One of the better ones I think, I would recommend this film to people"
5,Great book,"I think this is a really interesting book. It provides a lot of information about the history of the FDA and I found it to be an enjoyable read. The author uses a lot of examples, research, and personal interviews to present the content."
1,Out of Date,"I wrote this book. It was a good book in 1984, but it is completely out of date. If you want to learn about Mac software, buy something else."
2,Turgid Tome,"This epic weighs in at around 770 pages, and it's pretty bad. With stunning insights such as: ""If your COM add-in has a user interface, it must be integrated with the host application in some way, so the user can interact with it."", it's no wonder many trees had to die. Very, very poor editing job. I suspect a good technical editor could have gotten rid of 40% of the words in here and left only the information that I was hoping to find. Even then, much of the infromation is very superficial. I would recommend waiting for the third party books to appear."
1,not recommended,I have been a programmer for over 30 years. Never before have I seen so many pages taken to convey so little useful information.
5,Really Good But.....,"This is a really good cd but I'm a bit sad. All the songs except Get a Clue come from cds that Simon and Milo already had. They used to be called Prozzak. They combined the best songs from Hot Show and Saturday People on to one cd. Some songs that I really like from the earlier cds didn't get put on the new cd. I really liked I like To Watch (Milo's Night Out) from Hot Show as well as Hot Show and Shag Tag (You're It). They should have put those songs on the cd instead of lame Europa and Strange Disease. Those 2 songs have nothing on I like To Watch (Milo's Night Out), Hot Show, and Shag Tag (You're It). But they're still good songs. Other than that little disapointment, this cd rocks!"
1,Great CD,"My 8 year old son wanted this CD after he heard the ""Get a Clue"" theme song. Well, I was dubious, but ordered it anyway after we previewed a couple of other tracks on Amazon.com. We BOTH love it. There isn't a bad track on the CD. The songs are musically interesting and fun, and the lyrics are catchy and intelligent. The Web Site stuff is less intriguing - they obviously know their market - but what really sells Simon and Milo is their music. Keep it up, guys."
5,funny,They are really funny. Its really sweet. I like the song pretty girls(make me nervous) its so cute. Get a clue is a very catchy song. They are very cute.
5,Simon and Milo ROCK!,"My cousin and I are huge fans of this band! My brother bought the CD, and didn't like it (he's crazy) so he gave it to me. I just played the heck out of that album! It is still in my CD player, playing every minute. My favorite song is ""Get a Clue"". It was on the TV movie ""Get a Clue"" on Disney channel. I saw the video for it and loved that too! I hope they make a new CD soon!"
3,"ok,but not my best cd.","I was upset when I got the cd.My dad had to take off three songs,for cus words,and bad leracs.RIP OFF.The ony good songs are ""get a clue""and""infatuaation""."
3,WHAT HAVE THEY DONE!!!!!!!!!!,"What have Disney done to Prozzak (no sorry Simon and Milo as the americans know them). Milo looks a lot different than the canadian versions,save your pennys and buy the ""Hot Show"" and ""Saturday People"" albums on import from Canada, it gets only 3 stars cause Disneys turned them into mush..."
2,Get Hot Show and Saturday People,"First of all, I will get this off my back. Ashley, you're a child. Wow, so what is Prozzak says words that don't get censored on TV. Get a Clue sucks, its the worst track, because it's so Disney. It's not bad though, but the other tracks are better. I rather not buy this one, I already got Hot Show and Saturday People. I have always liked Prozzak, since their beginning in 1998. Disney ruined them. They even changed how Milo looks. Ashley, you're still an ignorant child."
1,only one good song,"I have only heard SMALL parts of each song and the songs are kind of obnoxious. I dont recomend this for kids.""Get A Clue"" is the only good song because it is related to disney so it has to be that way."
3,Savage insects,"More than half of this DVD deals with insects and birds. Now one would expect a DVD dealing with wildlife in Africa to concentrate more on the unique mammals of the dark continent. The title and director review imply footage of big cats hunting. however, there is not a single hunt by a pride of lions, a leopard, a cheetah, ...Overall I give it a generous 3 stars."
5,From The Director of Savage Secrets,"I am the director of Savage Secrets. Let me invite you to enjoy an extraordinary documentary made by one of South Africa's top cinematographers and the added interactive experience - a first of its kind! Stunning images will show you the fight for survival in the African savannah. Never before has the dance of predation been captured with such clarity and painful beauty. In addition, you can interact with the DVD by calling up explanatory videos, which, narrated by biologist Erik Holm will provide you with a deeper insight into the Savage Secrets of African animals. Additional features include a `Making Of....' in which award-winning cinematographer Fanie Van der Merve invites you to join him on an expedition to film animals in the wild. Rounded out by a photo gallery, this DVD truly provides a stunning window on life in the African savannah. Enjoy!Chris Sattlberger"
4,Good,"Good product, makes your hair soft and works great as a defrizzer (and for me, that's saying a lot - I have Hermione Granger hair.) The only complaint I have is the smell. It isn't a BAD smell...but it isn't a great smell either. Just smelling it tickled my nose and made me sneeze, and none of my hair products have ever done that before since I don't use hairsprays or anything like that. But, it worked so much better than the leave-in conditioners that I tried from the salon (Biolage products, for example). So for that, I will deal with the smell and give it 4 stars out of 5."
3,Nothing special,"I bought the smaller bottle of this leave in conditioner. Definitely not worth the hype and price. It left my hair more staticky than on the days that I don't use it. Everyone also raved about the smell, but I thought it smells like dish soap. It doesn't make my hair feel softer, shinier, fuller, etc..I'll probably continue to use it because I bought it and it's not like it ruins my hair, but I'd never buy it again. I have blonde fine hair."
4,Very Nice (but not crazy about the smell),"This leave-in conditioner is pretty amazing, it's pretty moisturizing but doesn't weight your hair down. It doesn't feel greasy or tacky. I do brush my hair after I put it on, in case there are small clumps. This conditioner is texturizing, and actually kind of volumizing. The only thing I don't quite like is the strong scent, it smells kind of pretty, but is very artificial. I don't like very highly scented products (lotions, shampoos etc.), so it might just be me being picky. The good news is that the strong scent wears off quickly after your hair's completely dry."
5,Great for smoothing out frizz!,My hair dresser uses this product and I loved the way it made my hair feel. It also works great to smooth frizzy hair. I use it every day!
5,AWESOME STUFF,"My hair dresser introduced the Smoother to me a few years back and I have used it ever since! It not only smells great but does a wonderful job for the shine, smell and thoes pesky knots! Highly reccommend this! I have been out of it for a week do to another company's mistake and my hair just isn't the same."
1,Rusk sensories leave in conditioner,"This product does not smell like passionflower at all. First of all I don't care if it is scent free or perfumed. I just want my hair shiny and smooth. This product made my thick hair dull and gross. My hair Texture became rough and it felt like I'm attracting dirt. I just spent a lot of money and I can't even use this product. I ordered the duo- Shampoo and Conditioner. I was expecting a shower conditioner not a leave-in conditioner. I will use the shampoo but I cannot tolerated the dirty feeling this leave in conditioner made my hair. I don't want to mail it back because then I will to go to post office and spend for mailing fee, too much of a bother for me. I'm totally disappointed."
3,Passionflower and Aloe Leave in Texturizing cream,I wish the procduct was pack better. The top part of the bottle was broken and the Leave In Conitioner was leaking all over the box. I needed up have to purchase a bottle to put the product in.
5,I love sensories smoother!,"The price very good, and the product excellent,leaves hair beautiful, do not need to rinse, I recommend it 100%, my daughter has very curly hair, I can control your hair with this product rusk sensories smoother."
3,Not wheat free,"This product has WHEAT in it. I couldn't tell from the listing. It smells fine, not too strong. But I have not used it on my hair because of an allergy. It is a pretty huge bottle and I hope my girlfriend enjoys it, cause I sure can't use it."
1,Worst,It makes my hair oily and got dandruff after using couple of times. I won't recommend this product to any.
2,Don't like it,"I don't like this leave in conditioner. I usually buy WEN products but was looking for something cheaper and just as comparable, but THIS IS NOT IT!!!! For one it smells terrible and my hair was greasy and thin when I used it. I guess I'll just have to save up for the WEN. It's to bad because this is a BIG bottle and I don't know what to do with it, it would cost just as much as the product to send it back."
4,An Exciting Cop Tale,"B.J. Whalen,s police thriller ""Justifiable Homicide"" is a hard to put down page turner. There is lots of action, with a high body count of baddies, plenty of injustice and even some redeeming vengence. It is a welcome edition to the cop-crook genre with a better than usual plot. Set in NYC it captures some of the up to date turmoil that often makes tabloid headlines. It is full of drug dealers, petty crooks, high paid lawyers and a few cops that sometimes stretch and even break the legal limits. Add some politics, a little sex, some humor and spred the story accross the state of New York and you end up with complex mixture that is often combustible and violent. A hard hitting, straight shooting tale that perhaps ought to have added a plural to its title. The reader will also have to decide if it is justifiable too! But the reader won't be bored!"
5,JUSTIFIABLE HOMICIDE,"B.J.WHALENS BOOK ""JUSTIFIABLE HOMICIDE"" WAS AN EXCELLENT READ. NOT ONLY A GREAT STORY LINE, BUT HIS KNOWLEDGE OF POLICE PROCEDURES WAS COMPLETELY ON THE MONEY. I WAS SORRY THE BOOK HAD TO END BUT I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO HIS NEXT ENDEAVER. ANDY SOVIA / RETIRED NYPD"
4,This CD has major soul,"I've seen Donna dozens of times, and I've seen Lauderdale play with them numerous times as well. I love Donna the Buffalo, but I have to say that they've never sounded better than backing up Lauderdale on this peach of a record. Their live shows together are unbelievably fun, rockin', and intense and this is the closest you'll get to that (unless you know one of the peple who tap into the sound board at Grassroots). All accomplished musicians playing and singing songs wiritten especially for their unique sound. You won't be disappointed."
4,Worked as advertised,It came well packaged. It installed in the unit with no problems. Good thing I had an installation tool... You could ruin it using a pair of pliers.
4,Jamie Escalante: Sensational Teacher,Knowing more of the man behind the Movie Stand and Deliver is inspirational to me. A good book for any math teacher to read.
5,Great Measuring Wheel,I am a landscaper and this measuring wheel is perfect for quickly measuring landscape beds and customer's lawns. Originally I had been using a reel type tape measure and by buying this measuring wheel it has saved me an enormous amount of time when I have to measure square footage as it relates to jobs I am doing. So far the quality seems great with this product. I would highly recommend anyone who wishes to measure things outdoors get this product.
2,"I love the A-Team, but these dvd's really stink.",It was a pleasure to see SOME of the episodes on these discs. Other episodes freeze up repeatedly during play and the others aren't viewable at all. I was very disappointed and would have loved to have seen all the episodes of this season. I just purchased season four and am having the same problems so far.
5,LOVED THE A-TEAM,GREAT DVD'S - MY 10 YEAR OLD GRANDSON LOVED THESE SHOWS AS MUCH AS HIS DAD DID WHEN THEY WERE ON ORIGINALLY.
4,The A-Team - Season Three,Excellent. Good quality. Wife enjoyed. I enjoyed. Been looking for the A Team series for a very long time. Glad that you had it available
4,Birthday gift,"I expect it to be wonderful, but it's a birthday gift that won't be delivered until early July."
4,Waiting for the movie!,What can I say. I'm getting myself ready for the upcoming movie. If you are a diehard fan you need to get this ! See ya at the movies...
5,DVD with a very good quality.,"The DVD presented an excellent quality so far. I didn't see everything yet, but so far it has been very good. There are scene selection, episodes plot for each episode, possibility of subtitles in English (I'm not deaf, but I still need it to improve my English!). Now, I finished the first disc and started the second one. Let's hope all the discs have the same good quality as the first one."
3,Nice season Dvds have problems,"For the first time ever as the package stats the set is presented in 3 Double Sided Dvds with the pros and cons they have.In the episode The Bend in the River I have some freezes on the playback which aren't serious but keeps me away of the events deplayed.These discs are more easily scratched than the single sided but in return they are cheaper to mass production and studios choose this also because more episodes can be included per side this way only 3 double sided discs are needed to fit the entire 22 episodes in single sided discs double discs will be necessary.Regarding the episodes another fine season with a lot of Guests Stars:Stepahanie Kramer(Hunter),Dennis Franz(NYPD Blue,Hill Street Blues),Richard Heard(V),Richard Lynch(Blue Thunder) and more.I will wait to see Season 4 my favourite."
2,Finally one without a scratch,I have ordered all the seasons for my son over the course of a year. This was the first season that had a disc without a scratch on it. You take your chances with this product.
5,"Murdoch in love,and,normal!!",Absolutely one of my fav episodes. Bounty hunters using Murdoch in an attempt to lure and capture the ATeam. What I particularly enjoyed was the fact that Murdoch's love interest was played by Dwight Schultz' wife. So sweet!
5,best shwow ever,I am glad they are going to bring this out again. I have been waiting a long time for the third seasonI will get it once it comes out.
4,Few books like this one.,"There are not many good books on chaos in both classical and quantum mechanics; this one is surely an exception. Gutzwiller is well known to be an expert in the field. However, it's a little bit disappointing that the book may be too ""qualitative"", that it loses the rigor as appeared in related journals. Afterall, this is a good book."
2,Close to Useless,"I am used to reading graduate texts where I have to fill in extensive portions of the logic. However, this book does not even begin to explain the results contained in it. It is simply a collection of results, with references to other texts with little explanation (although he does a good job motivating the results).As I was writing this review, I opened the book to a random page (279) and found the following: ""Zaslavski (1977) also starts from the trace formula; he gets a rather explicit expression for the spacing probability P(x) which involves the Kolmogorov entropy..."" How did he do this? Well, if you want to know then you have to go read Zaslavski to find out. The entire book is this way.Maybe this is a great reference for the researcher who already understands the field, but for someone trying to learn it from this book it's worthless."
2,We need more books on the subject,"While the question of connecting quantum theory to classicalmechanics, ODEs, PDEs, etc is a very deep one, and theauthor is a main contributor in the subject, the bookslacks of narrative momentum... Readers of, say, QFT a laItzkinson-Zuber will be accostumed to this, but I feel amore focused work on the subject is still to be written."
3,Damage? (I'm assuming it's from shipping),"I needed a ramp right away, but the 7' ramp delivered was very bent on one one side from what I assume was poor handling in shipping. It looked like someone had dropped it off a 10 story building. I would have returned it, but with my disability, It's too much of a hastle. Otherwise, it's a good product."
2,Edges dangerous,"This works well as a ramp, but no one wants to use because the rough metal edges are so exposed. Plus, it's really heavy,"
3,"Great to learn with, bad resources","This book is very good on teaching the basics of C#, and makes you think a bit. The tutorial driven approach enables you actually get experience in every chapter ( at the end of every chapter are good exercises). The problem is that you do not have the answers to the excercises available unless you have the Teacher edition ( this is a classroom book ) , and Deitel will not help you out in this area ( say if you are stuck on an excercise ).There are also 'Programming Challenges' at the end of every chapter that have you use command and concepts that you have yet to learn ( not in all but some ). Other than that, this tutorial is very good, just bad customer service from the authors."
3,The quality of the book is poor non the content but the material and lack of color,"I have the same type of book but for Java. It was a great book, same material but different language.This one seems somebody went to the Xerox copier and same the copy of the original.The CD does not come with the book but I can download the code. That is OK.I think the price is not justifiable but greed. This book should cost only $20 the cost of the bad paper copies.It is terrible that Dietel is loosing quality. It is not reason to charge that amount for this book. I do not return the book because the content and the way of teaching C# is my kind of tutorial that I like.I think somebody is making money just copying books. This books was not printed byt xerox copied."
2,Why bother?,I browsed the book and though it contains some helpful tips it is overloaded with episodes from the life of the author which I frankly find both uninteresting and out of place.I recommend reading a book from the antipatterns series instead.Anyway if you are still curious about the book why don't you download the freeware pdf version and decide yourself if it is worth buying it?
2,Disappointing!!!,"There is some useful information, but it's normally very hard to find because there is TOO MUCH DISTRACTING information such as kayaking and Mount Everest. Reading this book is very tiring because you have to try hard to separate the author's good programming advice from his programming career and, again, his kayaking experience. I am sure if the author tried hard enough to sum up the whole useful information, this book could be as thin as 50 pages.The author has to decide whether he wants to be a novelist or a computer book author..."
4,Good java anti-patterns book,good sections on the ejb and web tier with common anti-patterns illustrated. however most materials are introductory and i was hoping for more advanced techniques and advice to writing good j2ee app. this is definitely a good first book to understanding how to write/architect j2ee app the right way.
4,Very good.. finally understand beans..,"This book is very good at explaining some tricky situations in which we often get ourselves when programming web applications. It helped me weigh some stategies I had been using (sometimes improperly). In particular I benefited by the explanation of proper use of beans and the Command design pattern, which I had read about in numeros occasions but failed to understand until now.The book also plugs some holes that ""Effective Java"" should have covered.. like for example the NECESITY of calling dispose()/close()/destroy() functions in a finally block (my own personal favorite tip). I just regret the book didn't emphasize or practice it enough!My complaint about the book is that it seems to cover a few topics and then just abruptly ends.. I was expecting more."
2,Good for beginning developers,"This book is well written but I was expected something more advanced. If you have been a real J2EE developer for at least a year, you would probably have run across some if not most of the problems already. You also would have worked around them using solutions from other Java books you have.This is a good book for new developers. They should be able to recognize problems early on after reading this book."
3,Good But Could Have Been Better,"I'm mixed on this one. This books attempts to present refactoring in a way that inexperienced developers can understand. In that respect, I think the author delivers. If you're a beginner (or maybe into mid-level), get this book when you're past the fundamentals stage. Advanced programmers, however, will already be aware of most of the material from experience. I think it would have been better to target either either advanced developers with more complex topics and code, or just fine-tune this text a little to target advancing beginners to mid-level programmers."
4,Bitter - But Not Tasteless,"Bitter Java is an excellent example of how to balance real world Java development experience with more simplistic examples. Full of usefull development patterns, Bruce's choice of relavant examples will not deter an inexperienced Java Developer from gleaning good coding design and style.One of the nicest areas of the book where Bruce's experience shines is his use of refactoring to improve the performance and scalability of maintained code base. I certainly hope the importance of refactoring one's code is not lost on the reader. It is a must for everyday Java develoment; where code re-use is now being stressed as companies try to do more develoment with less resources.Bitter Java shows us the errors of our ways, but adds a bit of cream and sugar by providing us solid solutions for writing better client/server, JSP, EJB, and other J2EE code. Drink it down, while it's hot!"
2,Get the free PDF version if you really want to read it,"Don't bother buying the hard copy of this book. The so-calledantipatterns in this book are too simple for anybody who hasat least some common senses in using servlet/jsp/j2ee.Maybe useful to true beginners, but then the free PDF versionshould suffice."
2,"Rehash of other peoples work, with mistakes",The book has numerous poor examples or actual mistakes and whats good is easily obtainable else where.Where does the author get off reviewing his own book! Talk about cooking the ratings.
2,"Not bad, but very basic","Not a bad book really ...... if you never did (server side) programming. Or had someother decent education including topics like caching,modularisation, Model-View-Controller.For EJB there are better books (as Tate acknowledges)like Roman's Mastering EJBs or more general:Core J2EE patterns.So if you are just starting programming inuniversity, Bitter Java might give you a taste ofthe real world.Again, it is not a bad book, but very basic.A little bit wordy perhaps -- I do notmind his kayaking excursions -- but the text itself.Three years ago as a one-hourpresentation I might have liked to listen to Bruce Tate,but in 2002 as book this is absolutely boring"
5,Must for Java programmers ...,"Quite an intriguing title. The book opened up a whole new world of antipatterns. Good supplementary read to design patterns. Explores good techniques to develop Java applications.The author defies you to contradict the common sense of knowing antipatterns by giving interesting metaphors in real life.All in all, a ""must read"" book."
3,Another Cookbook,"I was happy to find this book about Lunar returns, a topic on which you will not find much literature. However, I was quite disappointed with the content. It's just another cookbook delineating planets in houses and aspects between planets. The delineations are well-written though. There is a short chapter on transits to the natal planets too and a (very) short chapter on New and Full Moon, retrogrades and eclipses. You will not find anything about the real standouts in the Lunar returns, nor about progressing the Lunar return chart, nor about important midpoint configurations, nor about the relationship with progressions or solar returns, nor about sensitive degree areas or exact conjunctions to prominent Fixed stars. There is nothing on the Lunar parallax. This book is a good beginning though and I'm glad somebody has written a book about Lunar returns."
1,Lunar Returns,"Please do not buy it! It is not worthwhile at all. No matter if you are a beginner or an advance student of astrology, the book is useless. The author has underestimated the reader using a kind of ""copy/paste"" method from any other kind of superficial book of astrology in order to explain the meaning of the planets in the houses and the aspects between the planets in a lunar return chart. You cannot learn a bit from it. Astrology is a very serious matter and books like this should not have to be published ever. I am very disappointed."
3,nuclear assault live in a hall loaded with seats?,"this is a good show but they did little more than just play,the sound was weak and some feedback(but ahaoh this is NA-feedback)great set list but the show lacked energy and a crazy crowd."
2,AURAL AND SENSIBILITY ASSAULT,"Nuclear Assault, featuring former Anthrax bassist Dan Lilker, have got to be the most monotonous, talentless thrash metal band in history. With a running time at just over an hour and 23 tracks it's obvious they pride themselves on playing songs that are less than two minutes long. It doesn't help that vocalist/guitarist John Connolly is adept at neither of his vocations. The only song that is memorable and comes close to being good is TRAIL OF TEARS. They butcher Led Zeppelin's GOOD TIMES BAD TIMES, which sounds unbelievably bad and B**TF**K is absolutely pitiful. Abominable, baneful and just plain rotten could sum up this video (yeah, I am checking my thesaurus). I'm only giving it two stars for TRAIL OF TEARS alone."
3,Wonderful Book; Poor Edition,"This is a gorgeous children's book; I had it as a child when it was first published, and I fell upon the re-issue about ten years ago and bought several copies for grandchildren and friends' kids. The illustrations were what made it so magical: beautifully conceived and drawn with lush colors.I ordered this latest edition, again for a new grandchild, and when it arrived I was very disappointed in the quality of the pictures. They look washed out and poorly saturated, as though the publisher were trying to save on ink. Comparing the two editions side by side, the difference is very striking. Although it's still a wonderful book, and not having seen the earlier editions a child won't know what he or she is missing, still some of the magic is gone. The fairy marbles no longer glow off the page and the silken scarf is a pale version of its former self. It's better than nothing, but what a shame to have taken the spirit out of those lovely pictures!"
3,Not a hit yet,"I have some other older fairy tales and golden books that my daughter adores. I thought this one would be good too, but the stories haven't been a hit with her as I expected."
5,Wonderful!,I remember pouring over this book when I was 4 or 5 years old (50 years ago). I couldn't read it all but I loved the pictures. My grandma read it to me at bedtime. She is long gone now but this book gave me warm fuzzies and I got teary when I found it.
5,Out of Print Classic,Fabulous illustrations to unusual stories I have never seen anywhere else- a classic from my childhood now given to my grandchildren!
5,Elves and Fairies Sparks Children's Imaginations,"The Giant Golden Book of Elves and Fairies has been a classic for generations. Its intricate illustrations of elves, fairies, pixies, brownies, trolls, leprechauns, and even a mer-baby spark children's imaginations. I received the book as a child, and the images and stories fed my imagination, and I drew from that in writing The Crystal Palace: Rescue of the Baby Fairy Prince. My granddaughter and grandsons were similarly gripped by the fanciful details. Stories in the book are best suited to school-age children, as some are too long for pre-schoolers. However, the poems, short stories, and illustrations lure the little ones as well. This book will be loved for generations."
4,My Favorite Fairy Tales,This book has wonderful stories and incredible illustrations! It was my favorite book as a child and I read and reread it many times. Even as an adult I'm searching for a new copy!
5,My favorite book as a child! Every child should have it. :),"I loved this book so much as a child. It was my favorite book to have read to me at night. The copy I had had been my mother's when she was a child and the cover was peeling and old but so beautiful and I loved it all the more because I knew that it had been treasured by my mother when she was little. The Garth Williams illustrations are incredibly detailed and beautiful, so delicate and ethereal. I would stare at them for hours. My favorite story was ""The Lost Merbaby"" followed closely by ""Singeli's Silver Slippers."" I also loved the story about the bear who works in a salmon canning factory. But really everything about this book is so sweet and otherworldly. It comes from a different era when childhood was simpler and more beautiful. Modern children's books just can't compare. If I were going to recommend one book for every child to have, this would be it, hands down."
2,Too expensive,"After ordering this I found one much cheaper at Walmart so I returned it. I will say the return process was simple, downside was having to pay return postage, which was still cheaper than keeping it"
5,Whats wrong people?,"Finding a cupcake stand for a wedding can be tough and lets face it, renting is $$$. Aside from some of the other reviews on the page I bought it for a wedding display. It was perfect! I can see what people maybe confused about this product but I was able to see beyond them. First off it is easy to put together and apart. Please take note it is plastic and it comes with a lace pattern around each plate. I know others have bought this for cupcake unsure of how many it will hold. I say about 125-150 will do well, anymore would be overload.If your plan is to us this a few times for weddings and parties, go for it. If you are a baker looking for a weekly use, best make your own with wood."
4,Beautiful Display,This tiered cupcake holder was great! It is very sturdy and makes a nice presentation. It holds 120 cupcakes easily. If you have less than that you will need to embellish the tiers with flowers or something. We tucked small flowers (real) inbetween the cupcakes and it was a beautiful alternative to a wedding cake. The guests loved the individual cupcakes.It can also double as a nice display for random desserts and treats.
5,Pretty,"I am buying this for my wedding in June, and it is very nice to hold my cupcake wedding cake presentation. It's a very pretty lace detail along the edges and will be perfect for my event.B. Hull"
4,Good cupcake stand but ...,"I really like it but I thought since it says 'cake stand' I would be able to put a small cake on the top and put cupcakes throughout the stand. The pillar comes up too high through the middle to put a small cake on top ... I will make it work, just wish it had that option. If someone knows something I don't, please post it. No instructions were included but I can't see a way you make it work for cake as well."
3,Cheesy white plastic BUT PRACTICAL,"When it arrived I felt as though it did look a lot cheaper than it appeared in the picture - just remember its white plastic. However, it does the job and looks ok!"
4,Cake Stand,"I was very pleased with the product itself and the speed of shipping. However, I could not find anywhere how many cupcakes it will hold. We haven't used it yet, but I think it will do nicely for the cupcake wedding cake in JUne."
5,"Hip, rocking jazz","Don't know what it is about Swing Out Sister. I have enjoyed their music since '87 and although there is a constant evolution in the sound of the music, I've enjoyed every album so far. Again, a nice range of styles of jazz is on this album."
5,Can't stop listening to this album,"I enjoyed swing out sister in the 80's--but wasn't sure what they would sound like twenty years later..WOW! I just bought this album and ""Where does our love grow"", and I can't stop listening to them. Their sound is much more sophisticated and this music ""draws you in"" as another person commented earlier. Am sooo glad I decided to re-visit this group again.."
3,for fans only,always good stuff from corrine and andy. however this one lacks the poppy hooks and punch of much of their other stuff.
4,Night music.,"Put it on. Layed back and listened. Felt like I was listening to ""Kalidoscope World 2"". Some instumentals ala ""The Swingle Singers""; think ""The Graduate"", some Bacharach like arrangements and all the things that Swing Out Sister reminds you of. No suprises, except ""What Kind of Fool Are You?"" and ""Where the Hell Did I Go Wrong"" and how they're worth just getting the album for. They feel like you've heard these songs before; brilliant, and wise. Thank God for this group. Wish they'd tour in the states,...and wish they made an album with a band backing them again.Lou"
5,Hits the spot perfectly,"I'll keep this short - if you like Bacharach, have discovered Francis Lai, have explored Michel Legrand, are hooked on Dusty, are interested in Morricone, appreciate what John Barry has done apart from Bond and are most likely over 30, then this collection was probably written and produced with you in mind. A highly cinematic offering, with a flow that makes it sound like a proper 'concept' album (to me it does, anyway!), I discovered this from a buddy in the States 5 years ago and haven't gone more than a few weeks since without hearing it.Hugely recommended."
4,Thomas the Tank Engine and Friends - Platinum Collection,"If your little one likes Thomas the Train then this is the collection for you! Thomas and his friends, Percy and James, get into all sorts of trouble but with help and cooperation solve their problems. It is entertaining for children but gives them subtle life lessons."
2,Not the kind of attitude I want my 2 year old to learn,"Our daughter loves her Thomas the Tank Engine, Percy, Lady and Salty trains. They look so sweet with their happy little smiles. Luckily, the trainset we bought for her came with a free video because I would have hated to have spent the money on buying the DVD for her. As one of the other reviewers mentioned - these trains are always ""cross"" and just all around grumpy. Everyone in Thomas World is miserable. So, we still let her play with her trainset - she just can't watch the videos."
3,too long introduction,I got this for my friend's boy- so I think I got the review toned down. She said it had the SAME preview that lasted forever before the actual video came on. The 2 1/2 year old saw it so many times that he just would get up to do other things...and she couldn't fast forward through it. She sold it later on Ebay. HA HA HA.
1,not good at all - so disappointed,"If you already have other newer DVDs, don't buy this set. There are alot of overlapping episodes (well, hence, ""the best of...""). The quality is very very bad, they should put in a little effort to remaster everything. Also, the episodes are out of chronological order. Neither of the 3 DVDs hold my son's interest for too long, and he is a MAJOR Thomas fan."
3,Could've been much better,"These DVD's could've been much better. I agree with what lillian said above. It would've been so much better to have the episodes in chronological order. That way kids would've been able to see how Thomas changed over the years. I dont't know why these DVD's need so many special features. Back in the days when all Thomas was on was Shining Time Station and videos the entertainment you got were the episodes themselves. And why does only the best of Thomas get a music video at the end? If one got the rest should've too. A good collection, but it had a lot more potential."
5,A beautiful Cinderella story,"Wow, I was expecting this to not be one the of the stronger Bridgerton books, but boy oh boy, was I ever wrong! It was just asmuch a page turner as The Duke & I was. When Benedict looks forSophie for almost a year, then finally gives up the search (but never the longing), I cried. But when he rescues her later, notknowing it is his long lost masqurade queen, I felt hope. It takes a long time, and an accident in the children's nursery, but he does eventually learn the truth. The jail scene, near the end of the book, was one of my very favorites in the book. I also liked ""My Cottage"" and the scenes that were in conjunction with it."
4,A wonderfully happy book!,"An Offer From a Gentleman was a great take on Cinderella. I was a bit unsure at the beginning -- it seemed a little unoriginal with the predictable characters. But after a few chapters, I couldn't put it down. I just loved this take on the fairy tale... and loved Benedict's sense of humor. The interaction between he and Sohpie was highly amusing as well. I warn you -- you must resign yourself to the fact that the story will seem a little predictable and familiar. But, then again, aren't most romance novels a little predictable? And it's a softer story -- there's no darkness or major love battles. (The sort you find in Judith McNaught's books for example.) Unlike most romances, Benedict isn't haunted by his past or especially resistant to love. Yet I didn't find the story lacking in any way! Quinn added some good twists too! Makes me wish I was a kid again and was convinced fairy tales were reality!"
5,An Offer You Can't Refuse,"Another Bridgerton bites the dust....or a romantic love at first sight, only it takes Benedict quite a while to realize that this is his soul mate!Sophie Beckett, illegitimate daughter of an Earl, along with the VERY wicked step mother, gets the ONE chance of a lifetime to go to a ball, a masquerade ball, and in so doing meets the man of her dreams. Much like Cinderella, when the clock strikes midnight she must flee.Julia Quinn takes over from there and a most delightful and positively romantic tale evolves in these two star crossed lovers finding one another again. Sophie recognizes Benedict immediately, but Benedict is still looking for the vision from the masquerade ball and doesn't recognize his soulmate dressed in the housemaid's garb.A truly wonderful tale, again from the pen of Ms. Quinn, whose novels are an absolute delight. I'll read anything this lady writes and positively it will come up a winner. Don't miss this one, it's a keeper!"
5,A book that will make you sigh,"Believe in love at first sight, and enduring soulmates? Then this one is for you. Here's a story about two people who travel long and far to find each other again and while it may strain the imagination a bit, each of the supporting characters lends real credibility to the lead character's storyline."
2,.,What a rip off!I was taken with how closely the story stayed to the original Cinderella tale at the beginning that I decided to stick with it to see what Quinn would then make up on her own for the next 300 pages but it was just a boring drag of time. I hoped something terribly abusive or violent would happen at the end but no such luck...
3,"Not bad, but....","I have read a few of Julia's books and they have been...alright. So I decided to give An Offer from a Gentleman a try and I think this will be my last book by the author.She's not a bad writer by any measurement just a little dry. The romance scenes were few and far between. Also, the ""offer"" was an...interesting pill to swallow, but tried to add some color to the story.I am a historical romance lover and a total sucker for love, but I did find myself skipping over parts because of redundancy or lack of interest.All in all...Not angry I spent money, but also not gonna spent it again...."
4,Sophie + Benedict = Cinderella + Prince Charming,"I suspect it must be difficult to write a series of 8 books about one family, occuring in the same time period, without being at a loss for inspiration. Julia Quinn's apparent answer was to recreate the classic Cinderella story. Although I found this story very predictable, it was also quite delightful. Ms. Quinn is such a talented writer that even this tired story line seemed refreshing with these characters. It did not bother me when Benedict suggested Sophie become his mistress. When you consider his social status and the rules of society at the time, it was all but impossible for him to even consider marrying her. He made the only offer he thought was reasonable to assure they would be together.All of the Bridgertons are in high form in this novel. Lady Whistledown still continues to offer interesting observations at the beginning of each chapter. Fans of the Bridgerton series will enjoy this light novel and charming love story."
3,It was good.,"It was a sweet story. I really liked both characters, they had personality and I really did like them.I guess this story line is just so over done that for me, I couldn't get really into it. I knew what was going to happen, I knew every step of the way what to expect. There was nothing really thrilling in it.It was well written though. I do love Julia Quinn's style. So far Anthony's story is my favorite.I really can't wait to read Colin's story."
3,Cinderella theme detracted from the book,"The Cinderella theme was a turn off for me. It took away from the story because I instantly knew exactly what was going to happen with the step-mother and step-sisters.The romance between Sophie and Benedict wasn't great either. The obstacles on their path to happily ever after were the saving grace of the book. It was entertaining and I never struggled to get through any of it, it just wasn't anything more than average and forgettable. That's a huge disappointment after how much I enjoyed the first 2 books in the series."
1,where was the gentleman in this story?,"This book was a severe disappointment, especially since J. Quinn is one of my favorite authors. The whole problem for me stems from the 'hero'. Basically, he treats the heroine like dirt for 90% of the story. After 2 other books, I feel well-acquainted with the Bridgerton family, and I think it is fair to say that Quinn intends to present them as ""good"" people. I find it hard to believe that a person with even a modicum of goodness would treat anyone (even a servant) with the appalling lack of respect that Benedict shows Sophie. I would recommend that any reader skip this one (especially if you like the other Bridgertons) and move on to Colin's book."
2,Clumsy take on Cinderella,"I love Julia Quinn books so that's why I may be harsh in my judgment on this book. It took forever to move along and could have used lots of editing. I ended up skipping chunks of pages hoping things would move along later in the book. In the end, I must have skipped a third of the book and regretted spending...on it."
2,Does not captivate audience,"The first two books in the Bridgerton series are really good, great characters and lots of laughs along with classic romance. The second and third are very boring. I could barely finish them they were so flat when it came to plot. I don't think I will even read the rest of the books in the series because of how poorly the third and fourth books were written."
3,The magic it's not there.,"I love Julia Quinn, and after reading ""The Duke and I"" and ""The Viscount who loved me"" and laughing as much as I did and enjoyed them, I expected the same to happen with ""An offer from a gentleman"", but I simply don`t like it.Another Cinderella story? with the same bad stepmother and stepsisters.....I just cannot finish it, althoug I am doing my best to do so."
5,This book deserves more than 5 starts!!!,"This has to be one of the best romances I have ever read, and let me tell you, I have read plenty. I honestly could not put it down. ""Offer From A Gentleman"" was the book that first introduced me to Julia Quinn and her other stories. It's been a few years since this book came out, but let me tell you, I still can't stop reading it over and over again.I recommend this book to anyone who loves a good romance and a good Cinderella story. This is a true reflection of Julia Quinn's work."
3,Definitely not her best!,"I know many people absolutely adore this one, but to me it pales in comparison to all the other Bridgerton novels. My problem is that Benedict is just not that memorable. In the previous 2 Bridgerton novels, The Duke and I and The Viscount Who Loved Me, he is overshadowed by both Colin and Anthony. All we seem to learn about Benedict is that he is the tallest Bridgeton. I just didn't find him interesting enough to care about his story. As always, Julia Quinn's trademark humor is present and this story is her take on Cinderella. But I felt like she needed to remake a fairy tale to make up for a lackluster hero."
3,OK,This was a disappointment in a great series. I love Julia Quinn and the Bridgerton's but this one did not have the usual spirit and creativity of her previous books in the series. The Cinderella story was predictable and I was more than a little surprised by the lack of depth with the relationship for the main characters.My favorite is still Romancing Mr. Bridgerton so I tend to compare them all to that one. So... this story was just OK.
5,Fantastic Romance!,"I have to tell you that this story was fantastic! I actually couldn't stop reading it.Sophie was inchanting and Benedict was so aluring!!You have to read this book if you like romance,comedy,sexy love scenes,and a lot of fun!!Julia,you have really done this romance world a great deal of good!!God Bless!!"
3,Entertaining but...,"Julie Quinn is one of those authors I pick up without hesitation. This book was fun reading while on the StairMaster but not up to her usual quality. Since it mirrors Cinderella (and JQ does a good job retelling an old story) saying the book was predictable would be redundant and unfair. But, the first two books of this series were fast paced with strong characters. Either the Bridgertons have become predictable or this book was written in haste. It lacked the spark I have come to expect from a Julia Quinn book. Unfortunately, this happens far too often when authors become popular and start churning out their books every three months.One more book like this and I'll have to go back to being selective before buying Julia Quinn's work. If you want a quick read that isn't going to distract you from anything else, this book will fit that bill."
5,Bridgerton Family - the magic continues!!!,"What a pleasure to be envolved by the Bridgerton Family again!!! Julia Quinn is brilliant!!! Among so many Regency novels she continues to deliver funny, tender and sparkling stories. From her enigmatic epilogue in An Offer from a Gentleman, and after teasing us for three novels with the prospect of Colin's story, I sincerely hope she doesn't change her mind. Penelope Featherington was always one of my favorite characters and I think she deserves an active role!! Maybe Ms Quinn can also bring the Smith-Smythe girls back!!!"
4,A cinderella story..............,"only in this one, one of the stepsister is not mean. It was a great spin off on cinderella and I truly enjoyed it. The only reason I won't give this 5 stars is because it was a very predictable story. I'm looking foward to reading more about all the Brigerton siblings and about poor Posy and Penelope. I love wallflowers."
5,Gogi Grant and the Wayward Wind.,"When I was 10 years old too many years ago(LOL!), I remember I got to see Gogi Grant in Las Vegas with my parents, I was 10 years old. She had a hit then, ""The Wayward Wind"". I got to hear her sing it among other songs live and in person on early evening. What a crush I had on her after that. I also like that song tremendously and still do. If you like oldies and walks down memory lane, this is for you. So take a stroll!"
1,One Song Does not an Album Make,"Except for the hit song ""Wayward Wind"" the rest of the album is a complete bust."
1,Not the product you have seen good reviews for....,"The Aramis Lab Series formula has been changed. The new one is NOT 'maximum comfort' and in fact is a simple mediocre cream. Do not waste your money on it. If you see great reviews and people saying how much they love this product, it is the old formula not the new one. Buy something else. (this review is by someone who was a big fan of their previous product)"
1,Which Genius changed the formula,"Its ruined THEY ruined it.I had been using this ridiculously expensive shaving cream for over 20 years when it was still an Aramis branded and scented product and it truly was maximum comfort I could not and would not use anything else. I am greatly disappointed in this ""new"" formula, it is no longer maximum comfort, if it stays ""new"" then I have purchased my last jar of this maximum comfort cream when it runs out it will stay out. Reminds me of the new Coke formula, just boneheaded."
2,"Numb lips, empty wallet","I really don't like the benzocaine effect. It's not so bad on your face in general, but around the sensitive areas of your lips the feeling is very strange. The other perspective I have is that if the cream was actually effective you shouldn't need to put the drug in it to give the ""sensation"" of a smooth shave. Oh, and it's way too expensive relative to the alternatives."
2,Gums up my razor,"After two swipes of the razor, the cream gets stuck between the blades, and won't wash out under the sink. A testament to the 'thickness' of the cream/gel. But shaving has become a pain and difficult!! After the razor gets gummed up, each subsequent swipe leaves a trail of lab cream on my face, instead of a clear spot.I don't need to 'try to figure out' my shaving cream. It either works or it don't, ya know?Yeah, it feels nice, and definitely protects the skin. But I can't shave with it."
2,Tried lab series,"I tried the lab series cream, and found it doesn't provide enough skin protection from the blade. Yes it ""numbs' the skin a bit, which does help, but even still it lets you ""feel"" the blade on your face;which is something I don't want to feel. Other creams I use like bigelow and art of shaving protect your skin and you don't even feel the blade on your face."
1,"Holy moly - not what I remember - Stay away, bring back the old",What a waste of good money... Purchased another tub of what I thought was the same product only to hear my face scream at me again and again - stoke after stroke - stop!! Whatever they did to the new and improved has made me look elsewhere. What were they thinking? They probably took something out of the product to increase their bottom line - a real shame since my face loved this stuff...
2,NEW FORMULA IS WASTE OF MONEY!!!,"I AM GLAD THAT SOME PEOPLE TOLD THE TRUTH ABOUT THE NEW ARAMIS SHAVE CREAM. I NOTICED THE DIFFERENCE WHEN I FIRST USED IT. IT IS THICKER AND MAKES SHAVING HARDER. I AM ALSO GLAD THAT I DID NOT BREAK OUT FROM IT. I WILL BE USING EDGE ALSO UNTIL THEY GO BACK TO OLD KIND. THERE WAS A CONDITIONER FOR THE FACE THAT EITHER THEY OR SOMEONE ELSE MADE THAT MADE MY SKIN FEEL GREAT, BUT THEY DISCONTINUED IT! I WILL LET MACY'S KNOW THAT THIS FORMULA IS BAD."
3,Editing for tech editors,Unfortunately I could have written this book. It did not present any new thoughts for this technical editor.
4,Wireless Controller,"It is great not to be tethered to the console, but when the batteries start going down it gets really annoying. Better use rechargeable batteries and have a spare set next to the console.The smaller size is also great for the kids but you don't sacrifice feel.All-in-all I think it is a good product."
1,No Connection,"right out of the box the controller connected for about a minute.then it lost the connection and was never reestablished. after about 3 hours of trying to get the controller to connect with no success I returned the product.the controller is a nice size for small hands, but not pretty enough to hang on the wall, and since it dose not function as a controller that is all it is good for."
1,"Connects at 2 inches, but not ""35 feet""",This device doesn't work well and does not connect unless I sit right in front of my PS2. I have had much better luck with other wireless controllers and ordered this one expecting the same performance. I was highly disappointed.
5,My children are happy; that's all that matters!,"I was doubtful about buying this item because of comments on some of the reviews; but having owned a couple of, them before without any problem, I decided to take the risk. Delivery was fast and when I plugged the first one and it worked, I was relieved; with the second one I wasn't so lucky. It didn't work, I contacted the seller and in a couple of days received a replacement, that I had no problems with.I didn't have a problem with My first set of controllers and haven't had one with this new set.They are small for My hands, and I always loose when I'm playing with My Son, but I guess that's why He likes them so much; and s long as He's happy, so am I!I will buy another set when this one stops working, if they're still available; because they work great and are a good value."
1,Probably won't work well - Don't bother,"I bought this part to replace a broken end cap and thought the switch would be a bonus. Unfortunately, the switch is so low in quality that it stuck down everytime I pushed the button. My 13 year old switch worked better than this. The end cap is NOT the same design as OEM. Instead of snapping in with plastic 'hooks', it's held in place by sheer friction. This basically means that every time you pull the shift handle, your fingers pry the cap off."
5,One thin cookbook to teach you everything!,"This is a fantastic book! It's great for rank beginners, because it presents 25 basic recipes with clear instructions, and for each one it also gives three variations, many of which change the nature of the dish completely while keeping the same fundamental procedures in place. It's an excellent way to learn how cooking works, not just how to make particular recipes. More experienced cooks will also find this book useful and inspiring, as it has such solid, reliable recipes, and suggests ways to vary them to great effect. Also includes cooking terms, fundamental cooking procedures, and lists of foods and utensils you should keep on hand."
5,Everyone should read it,"I read this book from start to finish in one sitting.I found it to be a very compelling, insightful and readable book. Instead of focusing on external behaviors, it looks at autism from the inside experience. It has been a step in the de-mystification of autism (for me)."
5,Highly Recommended,"This is a great book. There are so many books on the market where experts presume to know better than autistic people themselves and disregard autistic peoples own accounts of what it feels like to be autistic, but this one breaks that mould. It is not only packed with factual information about how the brain and the senses work, it explores the autistic experience with an open and enquiring mind, while still tying all this in with conventional explanations of autism and results from existing studies. This book has a great potential to be useful, not just to parents and autistic people themselves who are looking for information and understanding, but to educators and service providers, whom it could inspire and advise. Interesting and accessible, I sat down today and read it the whole way through."
4,sol right,"If you have an autistic child/person in your life, this book might help you make some sense of things."
5,Tonalin CLA,Product arrived quickly and just started using it. I cant say how well this product works since this is only my second day using it.
5,"Small, portable, perfect for street witnessing, etc","I own a slimline Bible, which I thought was a great size and for the most part it is perfect. After a mission trip where we did alot of street witnessing and I carried my slimline all day long along with tracts and more in a back pack, I realized I wanted to have tracks and Bible in my pockets, rather than in a backpack. This Bible is perfect for that. This version has a zipper, rather than a snap, which I think is ideal. It is the size of a deck of cards and thanks to the zipper, the pages don't get ruined, nor does the snap closure make it fatter. The letters are small, but it is impossible to expect the letters to be normal size, and for good eyesight, this is not an issue."
2,"Poor Quality of Leather, typeface.","This particular Bible, despite all of the accolades it has, is rather low-quality. First of all it is no longer available on World Publishing's website, so that is one flag. The leather has a cheap smell and grain and the typeface is not printed well onto the ""India Type"" pages. So it isn't even real India paper....This Bible was very disappointing for a small-sized bible. For $33.99, the quality just doesn't add up to that price. I prefer the Pocket Concord Edition by Cambridge University Press."
2,Poor quality,"A good bible makes me happy. This one makes me angry.The paper quality is terrible. The print quality is also bad.The covers are cheap and bend very easily in the wrong places.Amazon. Please stop lumping all the KJV bibles together. I thought I ordered the excellent version from Thomas Nelson 0529064170. Instead, I got the crappy imitation leather 0529058375"
5,Great handy book for soulwinners,"The size and shape of this book is great. Fits perfectly inside my wife's purse. It comes in very handy if you go out ""Soulwinning"". Very light and comfortable to read in bed."
3,Compact Bible,"This Bible works well, but its white and it gets dirty real fast, like within the first time you take it from the box. They should offer this in a black color. Print is small, but its a small Bible, that's to be expected. I died the cover black and now I have no issues with it."
3,"Jimmy Cliff is great, but this album is not","Jimmy Cliff is a master, and his music is fantastic, but this is not the album to go after. Although a nice double cd set, the second half of the second CD is entirely music produced well past Jimmy Cliff's prime. The first CD and the first half of the second CD are excellent classic reggae. It covers a wide range of his career, which for these parts, serves the listener very well. But in his later years, the beats start to fall apart and music acquires a rather synthetic feel. Jimmy Cliff is a very talented artist who created beautiful music, but I would recommend a different album such as Jimmy Cliff's ""Jimmy Cliff"""
2,excel 2007 vs 2003,"I love excel and have run excel 2003 for years - but I sure don't like excel 2007 - the menus are busy, over-developed and non intuitive - and you can't modify them back to the ""classic"" look and feel - what a step backward - I'm throwing away the money I put into buying 2007 and getting 2003 back - it's a super program, but 2007 is a real step backwards interface and useability wise. Buy 2003 if you have the chance - it might be forced out sometime - then I go to a mac running XP and I'll stay non upgraded."
1,Crippled by basic function,"Creating a plot with a few thousand data points cripples Excel 2007. There is no problem creating the same plot in Excel 2003, while in Excel 2007 the program grinds to a halt and takes minutes to resume working, or begins to consume large amounts of memory until the program crashes. A web search shows others experience the same problem and also that Microsoft has known of the problem since June of 2007 yet, as of September 2007 has not made a fix readily available. The inability to handle basic functionality such as this is a deal breaker."
1,Fail,"I am a power user of Excel and have been using it for nearly as long as it has existed, but I do not own this latest incarnation of Excel and never plan to.A good friend recently purchased a new laptop running Vista and with a full installation of Office 2007. She called me to help her with a spreadsheet that she migrated from Excel 2003 that was not updating correctly on several of the formulas. I can honestly say I've never been more frustrated by a piece of software in my life! I can navigate a spreadsheet with my eyes closed, but not only couldn't I solve the update problem she was having with Excel 2007, I couldn't find anything on the ""ribbon"" that was remotely familiar.If you purchase this ""upgrade"", expect to spend hours trying to figure out how to do things that previously took you minutes or seconds to accomplish in the past. The ribbon is an abomination."
1,Tragic,"Our firm consists of a 150 person office with 7 Ph.D.'s engaged in everything from R&D to marketing to client reports. To accomplish this we utlilize a wide range of technical programs ranging from SAS to R. We converted to the current suite several months ago and I can't begin to describe the loss of productivity. The best I can say is the the current version is far less intuitive and instinctive than old versions. All I can say is that this version appears to have been designed by the Microsoft marketing department with no input from heavy users. One-by-one our staff has requested to downgrade back to older versions of excel, word and power point. With the exception of increased worksheet size, this suite represnts a giant step backwards."
2,Annoying interface and Twice as Slow!,"The new menus/toolbars take up a lot of screen real estate. And, despite what Microsoft says about speed improvements, I just did some tests (I uninstalled '07 and installed '03) and calculations that took 5 seconds and 52 seconds (in Excel 2007) now take 3 seconds and 27 seconds (in Excel 2003). It's almost twice as slow."
1,Horrible horrible horrible,"I've been working with Excel for 20 years, and this latest version is just the pits. It's not just because I'm used to working with the old version- the latest version has no sense of logic, even after I've been working on it for a year.Ugh!! The absolute shamefully bad part of it is the graphing capabilities. The 2003 version has a logical buildup of the graph, assisting you step by step with titles, data, and axes, letting you see step by step how it was progrssing. The latest version simply pops a graph in front of you, and makes it extremely difficult to switch axes, format titles, and the like. Everything is buried in tabs somewhere, and I still can't get it to do what I want. There is clutter everywhere on the ribbon.Today I worked 15 minutes trying to get a graph to do what I wanted and it's still not right.I've decided to go back to the previous version.. what a waste Microsoft!!"
1,Thanks to the previous Reviews,"The detailed reviews of Excel 2007 helped determine that while I need to have a copy - it will be on a ""non-production"" box. I provide Excel bridge capabilities to Repository customers hence need to support Excel 2007 but I will not certify the product. My bridge uses VB-6 with the Excel COM libs. These have been remarkably stable. Not true of Excel 2007. Even the ""Open"" and ""Save"" operations needed to be reworked. Mr. Gates - please hurry up and give your money away so you can come back to Microsoft and salvage a company swirling down the porceline!"
1,yuck,"this kind of stuff is super-hip nowadays. it seems the more breakdowns a band can cram into a song, the more the kiddies will love it. i, for one, think it's a joke. this is not what bands like red roses for a blue lady and poison the well were thinking of when they married nu-emo with metal and hardcore. this all just comes out sounding like really bad nu-metal, except the kids are WAY more concerned with fashion. hopefully this whole terrible trend goes the way they all do, and soon. watch out dudes, your 15 minutes is up right about now."
4,Worthy product :-),"Would like to reccommend Zalman Reserator Plus as the best cooling system ever tried. It really does the job perfectly though there is one main concern :-(The water cooling system is promoted as a quite cooling solution , though in reality the water pump keeps producing some crackling/bubbling noise after a couple of days. That is a SHAME.I really appreciate the time and money, of course, spent to produce such a prodect, but it does requore changing the water pump sometimes as it malufunctions or stops.Good product , but needs some pumping refinments ;-)Well done ZALMAN."
5,The most interesting ideas about space/time,This book has compiled some of the most interesting and thought provoking ideas about shaping the future of the world. A must read with beautiful illustrations.
3,good old book,Book was listed as being like new but pages were extremely yellowed and slightly water damaged. Usable text book though and arrived quickly
2,"review of thermo, kinetic theory, and stat thermo book","The item was not as described. It was definitely not ""like new"" since there was quite a bit of wear and markings on the cover and the pages were yellowed. The book had several highlightings and things written inside. It was not in extremely poor condition. However, I expected ""like new"" condition and was disappointed."
3,"Professional, but not clear","Firstly, I think that Panasonic is one of the greatest electronic manufacturers and have never had a complaint about their products. I bought this camera for it's extensive features, color, zoom, sound and brand name.Setup was really simple. It was packaged nicer than any camera that we have ever bought. The interface and feature set is great. But the clarity isn't acceptable:From less than 10 feet away, I could not see letters on a sign that were almost 1"" tall. There is no adjustment for focusing. The zoom is a digital zoom, so you can not see the picture any clearer by zooming in. It just makes the unclear picture larger.We have many different low end and high end cameras in our company, where all of them can focus on letters further than 10 feet and smaller than 1"". We will try to find money in our budget to buy the KX-HCM280 or similar camera, because it gives an autofocused razor sharp clear image."
1,NOT for Macintosh!,I was so upset when I received this product and realized it does not support Mac at all. Big waste of time.
5,Best Network camera for remote monitoring,"Panasonic makes the best network camera for monitoring. It can be used for monitoring your house and anything remotely. pros are as follows1- Ir has its own website that you can connect and monitor the area2- you can move the camera and monitor a wide area3- It has voice capability4- It has motion detector that can take picture and email it to the owner5- Streaming, and voice quality is excellent.6- It has strong security features7- you can monitor your house from any computer or mobile device.To install it you should be computer literate and know how to change your router. Panasonic has excellent technical support that can walk you through successful installation."
3,Yet Another BEST OF Collection,"They all can't be ""best of"" collections, can they? Nope. Most of them are cheaply licensed, low quality pressings. But of the low quality Maytals records out there, this cd is one of the better ones. That's not saying much, but it's definitely better than the current pressing of MONKEY MAN that sells for $5.99. You'd still be better off picking up the Island and Trojan cds of Toots and the Maytals, but *if* have to pick one of cheap pressings, this one isn't as bad as most of them. The best ""best of"" collection was pressed by Trojan several years ago, and it was called, ""The Best of Toots and the Maytals,"" which was the very first ""best of"" collection and, with the exception of the Island recordings, the only ""best of"" collection that did justice to the group. Unfortunately, that original Trojan cd is either out of print or extremely hard to find. Until it's reprinted, settling for a cd like this will have to do, I guess."
5,"Beautiful, superior qualify knife!","These knives are beautiful and incredibly well made. I've been using them for several months now and I couldn't ask for a nicer, more well balanced, superior knife. They sharpen nicely and keep their edges for a very long time. Yes, they are expensive, but I will have these for the rest of my life. I am very pleased with this purchase."
4,Not a bad debut,"This album had a lot of potential and the talent of these three women is great. Champ shines on 50 bars and Better. Ntyce's lyrics are incredible despite her childish voice, and J-Boo is solid on every track. Their best song in my opinion is ""Like What"". This track is good because of the chemistry, dark beat, and how they take turns rappin. The only problem I had with the album was the production. Storm produces most of the tracks for Deadly Venoms. If they drop a second album it should be better if they get a better production staff."
4,Very Enjoyable Memoir,"I flew this book and felt very satisfied at the end. Ciment tells us just the right amount about her childhood to help us understand the sometimes bizarre and devious adventures she survived. Ciment did a great job, too, of throwing in appropiate historical and cultural markers. Worth reading!"
4,A memoir that parallels mine,"Many of the accounts in her memoir parallel mine. Living in the San Fernando Valley, having a strange father, going to NY to be an artist, and going to art school. In fact, I took several of her creative writing classes while at art school and felt a connection with her artistic sensibilities but at the time she hadn't published any books yet. 20 years later her name pops in my head and I do a search and find she has several books under her belt. I am looking forward to reading her novels."
1,What's the point,"I write this review to warn readers who may be misled by other reviews. This is an updated David Copperfield without the same zing.I don't see the point of the book, just as a chronicle of one's sufferings. At the end of all this, jill makes it big by cheating.In my opinion, in terms of the story itself either, there has to be something clever and funny, or there should be something deep, universal and touching. Unfortunately, this book fails on both counts.I would advice others to go back to David Copperfield or Great expectations. They are far more enjoyable."
4,cool track byt,"the hidden version is truly a classic as far as I am concerned.the added benefit of VC on backing is extra candy, a little sweeter but the same candy.CC did justice to this song as JM could not."
4,Mellow Yellow,"I read the reviews...some good, some bad...it was one of the better things to me of ""Two Weeks Notice"". I've never heard ""Counting Crows"" before -- sorry! I did, however, want to know who re-made this song (Big Yello Taxi). It's good."
5,FAVE COUNTING CROWS SONG!,Big Yellow Taxi is a great Counting Crows song! It's my favorite!Vanessa Carlton lends her lungs to the song too! It's very catchy! :-D
4,A Great Way to Spice up Your Sex Life!,"This book was fantastic. It is full of different games and techniques for you and your lover to enjoy one another in new, wonderful, and satisfying ways. It is a must have for any couple."
1,If your idea of art is dogs playing poker,"Then buy this book!One, maybe two decent images in my opinionAlthough art is subjective there are just too many flaws with these images to warrant publication, I just cant with good concious tell anyone to buy this book.He seems to be very talented with other types of subjects, but his work with flowers, a favorite subject of mine, just left me totally cold.Check out Sue Bishop or Kay Dammagard or even Tony Sweet they may not hob nob with the rich and famous but they know how to bring out the Beauty of nature."
1,JUNK!,I should have known this was gonna be junk considering the price. It even looks and feels cheap. It was DOA. Wouldn't even power on. There is even horrible english on the package. Nothing you read on the package makes any sense and no instructions either. Don't waste your time and money (you don't get refunded shipping). Spend a little more to get the NYKO sensor bar instead. That one actually works.
3,Good music but muddy sound,"This album is full of great salsas. However the recording quality seems poor to my ear--there is a muddy feel...almost like you get on some bootlegs. Just play ""Pena de Amor"" from ""Wild, Wild, Salsa"" and then play the one on ""Todo Exitos"". I think you will hear the difference. If you are looking for your first Puerto Rican Power album, make ""Men in Salsa"" or ""Wild, Wild, Salsa"" your choice."
5,"It's good, try it! you'll like it!!!","I have this DVD. I like it. It's a great introduction to bellydance. OK I'm not crazy about the chosen music. But as far as instruction, EXCELLENT!!!!!It is not boring as it does move along. perhaps a bit fast for this begginer, but hey! thats what the replay button is for. Neon is a class act! If you want to study a paticular ""dance"" in detail, perhaps this might not be the right program for you. But it is as it states ""A crash course"" at any rate. I loved it!!!"
1,"I watched it, I tried it, I hate it",The production was cheesey. The moves were stiff. The background and costumes were bad. And I just can't warm up to Neon. I was severely disappointed in this video.
2,Disappointed,"I was disappointed when I watched these dvds. I purchased both of Neon's volume 1 and volume 2, and I am returning both. I am sure I could learn something from them, but the flavor and the spirit is not what I was looking for at all. I find her approach interesting, but I am going elsewhere.I was expecting more of a traditional type of instruction. Neon seems very talented, and is quite easy to understand, but this was not what I wanted. I am sure she is an accomplished dancer, and very talented, but I wanted authentic music, and more traditional instruction for someone interested in belly dancing for belly dancing, not for clubbing, not just a surface approach.I have to say that the spacy techno music is HORRIBLE!!. How she chose that as accompaniment is beyond me. I love middle eastern music, and that was a real let down.I have to move on to something more to my taste. Sorry Neon."
4,good,"if you want to learn basic moves (and not only) it is excellent, instructions are clear and easy to understand. BUT it is a little bit ""kitsch""."
4,Enjoyable look into America's language,"What fun! Any fans of the English language or American pop culture will enjoy this reference book of common (and not so common) slang. I really enjoyed the origins of slang terms, which Mr. Dunn provides for many of the entries.Gaining insight into the private language of these professions, sports, and hobbies was very interesting, and many quite humourous. Some could offend, however, and the book is not recommended for children.One suggestion I would have made to Mr. Dunn is to have used periods to clarify acronyms that are pronounced by the letters (D.O.A.) and no periods when they are pronounced as a word (NASA), as I was confused as to how some terms were to be pronounced (all acronyms are listed without periods).I'm hoping there will be other editions of this book, as I'm sure there are many other lexicons in American culture to be explored."
3,Un grupo diferente?,"Aquellos que nos enamoramos del grupo con los discos Cafe Tacuba, Re y Avalancha de Exitos, tenemos el corazon roto al escuchar este disco. Dejando atrás los sonidos mexicanos y la tematica latinoamericana, vemos a Cafe Tacvba con un sonido similar a Radiohead, Coldplay y Flaming Lips, y con letras instrospectivas y personales.No es un disco malo, pues musicalmente y liricamente es excelente. Sin embargo, es totalmente distinto a lo que conocemos y adoramos de Cafe Tacvba. Me acostumbre a pensar que Cafe Tacvba no se limitaba a un solo genero o estilo, pero asi han hecho en este disco.Una famosa publicación americana catalogó el disco como ""el más accesible"" del grupo. Sin embargo, para los fieles seguidores de Café Tacvba es el disco más inaccesible."
3,There's Something Missing....,"This CD is pretty good if you are a fan of good music, but if you are a fan of Cafe Tacvba, then there is some dissapointment. In all of Cafe Tacvba prior releases, they have let their audience know that they are from Mexico, by adding a lot of spanish style instruments. On ""Cuatro Caminos,"" they seem to have aimed towards an American audience and did not what them to show off their ethnicity (although the lyrics are in spanish). So if you want to hear this Mexican band play along with their roots, get their ""Reves/YoSoy"" album instead."
5,Cafe Tacuba beyond the stars...,"...a blue napkin on my desk, CD cases nearby, let's pick one up : cuatro caminos...my dog asks me for a walk but CD in hand I think, first, something about this CD I have to say: ladies and gentlemen: the four stars you see on the average review is a bad joke, this recording deserves the universe lodged in a stone made of memories made of tears of melancholic joy...""mas valiente..."" shows up off of ""camino y vereda""...I remember...I smile, this disc makes me believe in MUSIC all over again...Here's a story: I went out to the concert in Atlanta, no much money, no beers, full and direct muic, that's it, despite raw moments from the outside, you could see huge expressions of reality made Art...""Culerooo..."" somebody yelled at the band to let them know we did really need more and more, Cafe Tacuba comes back and hits the stage with dreams...now I'm listening to ""Soy o estoy""..."
3,Not too good anymore,"'Eres' is a bit too cheesy!!! This CD is not very interesting, look for their other CD's, it's been downhill since 'RE'."
5,"wow, what a differance...","I have every cafe tacuba cd and when i bought this one, i couldn't believe that it was them. They have evolved so much as a band, its awesome how they can change their stlyes and it still turns out awesome. In this cd, you get a more mellow vibe, even though the do have songs like Eo , que pasara, and recuerdo prestado that are more upbeat. Some of my favorite songs on this cd are cero y uno, que pasara,and encantamiento inutil. And of course you cant forget the always unforgettable love song of almost every album.....and in this case its...Eres....oh man, you cannot go wrong with this song.....even though elfego doesnt sing it, emmanuel does and awesome job with this song. Its a must have."
5,"Smart, fun and off-center music","As a fan of ""world music"" (whatever the h. that means) I'd heard a buzz about a Mexican rock band named Cafe Tacuba. Curious, I picked up their latest CD, along with a bunch of different stuff. Yet I found that this was the album I kept coming back to. My Spanish is pretty lame, but I can get the gist of most of the songs. I was impressed with the freshness of the music, and wit of the ideas, as well as the catchiness of some of the grooves (like Que Pasara). I mean, it's hard to sing along with a song when you don't know the language, but several of these tunes had me doing just that. Other reviewers lament the lack of references to specifically Mexican instruments or styles, but I sure didn't feel like I was missing anything. This is a great album to my jaded ear."
1,Free would be expensive for this book,"If this book was being given away for nothing it would still be expensive for what it is.All you'll find in this book is yet another introduction to NLP, and not a very useful one at that. It has its moments, to be sure, but they are VERY few and far between and far outweighed by the misinformation and pure waffle that make up most of the book. Almost any book on NLP would be more use than this, and why it claims to be about Brief NLP Therapy is anybodies guess. Apart from quoting Steve de Shazar's ""miracle question"" there's really nothing here to tell you its about ""brief therapy"" rather than any other kind.Save your money - this is a real non-starter, especially at this way over the top price."
5,Great!,I gave this gift to my boyfriend. The package came on time and was a great fit! He loved it! He wears it while he dances to Gangnam Style.
4,Great !,"It's Comfortable. I Love It ! Pick The Right Size Though, I Picked a Size Too Big But I Like It Anyways . It Looks Exactly How It Looks In The Picture ."
4,This appears to be a good quality hoodie,"Finally received the correct product 12/10/12 and it looks like it is represented online. Cost me $4.33 to mail the wrong product back and the company credited me $3.50 so it wasn't a large loss, just a large frustration.Anyway the hoodie looks nice."
3,Worth Tracking Down,"I heard the entire Gary Wilson album before I read the story about his early musical career, attempts to get this album released, and the story of the release 24 years later. Doesn't matter. Wilson created a hip, quirky album that's two parts Joe Jackson, one part Gary Numan, and one part late Steely Dan. Puree and enjoy.The standouts ""6.4=Makeout"" and ""Groovy Girls Make Love at the Beach"" are late night, lounge fun.The album was certainly ahead of its time, and it's true it's hard to get. The pursuit is worth it."
1,Owch...burned by hipsters AGAIN,Bad record. VERY bad!!!! Hipsters like this which means you must DESTROY all hipsters within range! Too bad the tapes weren't lost along with Mr. Wilson.
1,I don't really know you,"A little bit more off-beat than I expected. Actually, a lot more off-beat. Perhaps this CD should have stayed in the cut-out rack."
4,When It All Falls Down,"Exclusive is a good fiction read that will take you into the world of the fast and fake music industry.Tisha Ariel Nikkole is a journalist with her heart set on being with Shout, the hottest rapper out. She lands an interview with him and eventually completes her mission on winning him over. Of course the story wouldn't be good without the drama that comes along with being with someone famous, in particular a rapper. Many people pray for fame and money but as Shout's story shows, there's a large price to pay for notoriety.I liked the author's flow and found that the book moved at a fairly even pace. There were some pretty good points brought up through the fictional articles from journalist Tisha before each chapter. Some of the situations, in particular the ending, were a bit out there for my taste but the author may have felt they were necessary to tell the story and set up for the sequel.I would recommend this novel and I look forward to reading the sequel."
4,Exclusively spilling the beans!,"The story between the covers of this book was VERY good. This is the first book that I've read from this author, but it WON'T be the last. The pain, paranoia, friendship, fast-paced life of the hip-hop music industry is written from a forgotten dimension - the dimension of a journalist. Characters and scenes are surprising at times; and not to forgot the consequences that come along with being in the circle of celebrities. I won't tell the story, get the book! Well done Ms. Shiraz - great job! I am definitely looking forward to the sequel. ""PRIVACY""."
4,This is good,"This is a good book and well written I might add. I felt like one of my girlfriends was telling me a story about what happen in there life. The story line is great, I am a little mad BECAUSE I WANTED TO KNOW WHAT HAPPEN TO SHOUT AND TISHA AND JORDAN, DARNIT. I HAVE TO WAIT FOR PRIVACY THE NEXT BOOK."
4,Colossians Bible Study,In reviewing this book I was initially not sure how well it would work as a study book for a small group. We had been used to studying Bible books more on a verse by verse basis. I was very pleasently surprised as the book worked very well as a starter for good conversations. Good applications.
3,Entertaining,"Entertaining but not particularly engaging or memorable. I found it an interesting take on the Aurthur legend. I have a particular interest in Scythians and Sarmatians--of whom we know too little and see even less of in popular culture. I wish the Sarmatian storyline would have been slightly more developed with some insight into the characters' backgrounds and the concept of freedom and equality found in their society and within their legends--out of which the story of the round table supposedly grew when the Sarmatians were seconded to Hadrian's wall. Instead, the concept of freedom was attributed to half Roman Arthur's favorite philosopher, Pelagius, in the movie. All in all, this was a fairly standard action film."
2,The Ultimate Movie Review! - [...]- @tss5078,"It was really cool to see King Arthur from a more historical viewpoint, rather than the mythological one that's been done and done. The movie had its moments, but overall it was pretty dull. I can't recommend something that put me to sleep."
5,Deceivingly sharp!,"Besides Shun's normally great design, this is amazingly sharp. Doesn't feel so sharp because of the scalloped blade but it glides through grapefruit, simply a pleasure to use. It's replacing my Wustof tomato knife, it's a huge improvement over the Wustof. Be aware because of it's design, it's best suited for the right handed user."
5,This has become my go-to knife,"I bought this knife to complement the stainless set I purchased that didn't come with what I though was a good mid-size knife. Since buying it, it has become my go-to knife for basically anything that doesn't need something as large as a nakiri or santoku. The subtle serrations work wonderfully for all your vegetables, not just tomatoes (which it cuts paper thin by the way)."
5,good to keep you organized,"This book is pretty comprehensive. It has pages for budgeting and to write down different possibilities to compare each one to the others. It also is very helpful in giving approximate priceranges for different wedding items. Further it states which wedding items usually consume how much % of the wedding budget. The book even offers advice in the kind of dress that should be picked depending on when the wedding is and how formal it is and some stationary examples for what can be written on the invitation. It even goes into detail on some flowers. All in all I think it is a good comprehensive guide to plan a wedding, but I would supplemented with decoration ideas, that can be found online.As one reviewer mentioned, even most of the things that are in this book can be found online. I think I have to agree with this, I found webpages, such as the knot, quite informative regarding weddings."
4,Great book with lots of pictures for ideas!,"This book was very helpful in helping me plan for my wedding. Although it doesn't have any tabs for each area of a wedding, it would have been a big help so that I wouldn't have to thumb through the book to search for specifics. Has great outlines to follow and good for self planned weddings. It has a lot of great deocrating ideas and money saving tips as well."
5,Haitink's earliest recordings of these Bruckner symphonies,"Bernard Haitink's earliest recordings of Bruckner's 6th and 7th symphonies are still among the finest available. Athough it is a shame that Philips did not choose to enhance the sound using the latest state-of-the-art digital image-bit remastering, the sound quality is still fine. To his credit Haitink's recordings and performances of these symphonies have been among his finest, demonstrating his strong affinity for Bruckner's scores. His interpretrations have emphasized well both the sonic cathedral aspects of these scores while adhering strictly to steady tempi, without sudden pauses which characterize other interpretations. Of the two recordings, my favorite has to be that of the 7th symphony, which was recorded back in 1966 (The 6th dates from 1970). Fans of Bernard Haitink, the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra and Bruckner will not be disappointed with these fine performances."
5,buy this,"Its historic, epic, and fantastic. Buy this and you'll love it, much better than grabbing it off PBS or continuing to watch it on your old vhs."
4,"This DVD is ""almost"" perfect","This was a fabulous show if not for THREE points:1. David Gilmour wasn't there2. They just ""had"" to put Sinead onstage, staring at her feet the whole time. I fail to see whats so great about her.3. Roger Waters made a mistake in choosing Van Morrison to sing ""Comfortably Numb."" Van is a classic singer, no doubt, but he just doesn't have the right type of voice to sing ""Comfortably Numb."" If David Gilmour couldn't have been there to sing it, they should have used someone with a soft, mellow voice that could have sung the song the way it was MEANT to be sung. By the way, is there anyone out there that can tell me who the two main guitarists were? One guy was kinda skinny and had black shoulder length hair and played most of the guitar parts. The other guitarist played a Les Paul, mostly. Thanks. JonM11100@aol.com"
2,I CAN'T BELIEVE WHAT I JUST EXPERIENCED,"The ONLY reason this DVD got 2 stars is for the monumental effort that went in to producing it. Visually, I really had no complaints - Camera angles were solid and the actual production of the DVD was well done. This in itself should have warranted at LEAST 3 start correct? NOT SO FAST. Very few times in my life have I wanted to poke my eardrums out with a fork ... this was one of them. I have never experienced such a musical hack job in my life! The ""artists"" they collected for this production absolutely and unequivocally DESTROYED Pink Floyd The Wall - For whatever stupid egotistical reasons Gilmore and Waters are not speaking, they should have put aside their differences for ONE NIGHT and did this thing the RIGHT way. Some things should never be tampered with - This is proof positive."
3,"amazing performance, but screwed up some easy things","many of the cover vocalists were atrocious, the stage antic was unbelievable, like holy sht ridiculous, but better cover vocalists could have been used to make it a 5 star"
4,Great Video,"I like this band anyway. Roger Waters is not my favorite, as he was fired after this production. But it is entertaining."
3,The DVD skips on too much,"While I was pleased with the low price for the DVD, I must say I was disappointed with it. It consistently skipped on most of the songs and I really did not enjoy watching it."
5,Great Music,I spent 6.5 miles on the treadmill before I finished this DVD and didn't even realize the time had passed by. Great music! Great group of entertainers!
4,Awesome concert,"I like this concert. I think Roger Waters did a really good job of getting a good support group for this show. It's a shame that he couldn't get the support group that belongs in this concert - the other members of Pink Floyd. It's interesting that the two Germanies could unite, but Pink Floyd couldn't.As I said, I liked the people that he did get. The Scorpions for In the Flesh, Sinead O' Conner for Mother and others. It is interesting that Roger Waters sounded old for this concert and not for In The Flesh.I am happy they released this one in SACD. Now if they would release the others."
3,Better in some places than others,"The movie is better in some places than in others the terrible job on comfortably numb, but one of my turns stands out as being really really good. I would buy it, but this is NOT Pink Floyd."
3,Good Effort--Medicore Execution,"First of all, the sound for the concert is clearly cleaned up, as I heard this show when it hit the radio the first time. There were points in the radio show that were clearly unlistenable.I know some Floyd purists won't like all of the guest stars, but they are not bad half the time. Bryan Adams works fairly effectivly, and Paul Carrack on Hey You is even better than the original. On the other hand, Cyndi Lauper on Another Brick 2 and Sinead and the Band really take away from some otherwise powerful songs.The imagery of this show is spectacular, as it must have been for the original tour (do they have an entire concert for that?). It translates to video quite nicely, something which wasn't transmitted for the Momentary Lapse tour.I'd say this is a nice one to get if you're a Floyd or Waters fan, but keep an open mind."
1,We're still waiting for Pink Floyd The Wall Live DVD,"Ok Roger, you know how good songwriter you are. But even you sometimes have to admit you have done some really great mistakes, like this 1990 performance with all those horrible guest singers and musicians. Only Sinead O'Connor is great, also Scorpions and Brian Adams are very nice, but the rest...Roger, you really have to admit The Wall without David Gilmour's guitar and vocals is simply NOT THE WALL, that's the truth. Please Roger don't be obstinate anymore and release the most hystorial, wonderful, powerful and hidden performance from all times, and the most awaited DVD as well... Pink Floyd The Wall Live. All fans know there're enough footage from Earls court August 1980, as well Earls Court June 1981.Thanks"
1,Tear down The Wall!!! PLEASE!!!,This version of The Wall shows without a doubt that the reason the original album is so good is because of the band that played ie Pink Floyd.This version is full of so called stars which butcher and hack their way through each song and you sit there waiting for the wall to be torn down so you can eject the video and never watch it again.Van Morrison sounds like he is drunk when he sings Comfortably Numb slurring his speech.Also I though Roger Waters was totally against stadium concerts which was his original influence for creating the wall even though the proceeds of the concert went to charity.
1,Just who the hell does he think he is?,Roger Waters has an ego on him like no one else. They were right when they called him a megalomaniac!
1,"bad reviews, high stars?","Ok, as everyone has said this is a waist of money, a horrible attempt to create an incredible experience...but why is everyone saying how bad it is & still giving it 4 & 5 stars?"
2,Would have been great IF it were Pink Floyd.......,"After reading some of the reviews, I feel some of the people are confusing this video with the ORGINAL movie, ""The Wall"". Sad to say, although the name is ALMOST the same, no winner this time. While Roger Waters did a bang up job, the video lost a lot when performers other than the orginal group added their interpretation of specific songs. When you you buy a Rolls, you expect a Rolls and NOTHING else will do as a sub.....Here is hoping that some of the wild rumors that Roger and crew and will be getting back together again.Not a great video, but if you are a die hard Pink fan, it should be added to the collection"
2,"great stage, bad choice of musicians","the stage in the video is great and the music is still great, but having O'Conner , Lauper, the Scorpians, and anyone else sing the music of Pink Floyd is a bad idea. I'm surprised that Waters's ego allowed someone else to sing a Floyd song. I would have given the video five stars if Roger had invited even one ex-band mate but that was his ego in the way again. Great stage, great music, bad choice of singers."
2,Good Concert but not a good mix,"so this is a fairly good concert, i would rate the actual performance about a 4 out of 5 but the surround sound mix for this SACD is just poor. The left and right channels get most of the sound while the rear channels get the shouting of the audiance and not much else. The second problem was that the bass is just missing. usually i have to turn my active 150 watt subwoofer only to about 4/5 to listen to SACDs, because they usually have lower bass than normal CDs but now i had to turn it all the way up, and it still sounded shallow, meaning no deep bass. I would have tried the normal stereo CD layer....if there was one. All my other SACDs have STEREO and SACD layers (HYBRID SACDS). They are: Dark Side of the Moon - perfect mix by the way, Brothers in Arms, and Slowhand. So I would have prefered this to be a Hybrd but, now it mostly gathers dust. Makes me sad to see how it just sits there. Still, a good concert."
3,If I had my way... I'd have all of you shot,It's decent.... not as good as the original Wall... but it's interesting to hear other people on the it. It's not a MUST buy... but for you complitests... and Wall addicts.....
3,"Great DVD, poor packaging","It's a great DVD, but it comes with a bad packaging, which makes hard to take good care of it"
3,It's just not floyd...,"As a die-hard Pink Floyd fan, I wasn't very stunned by this DVD.It's a big spectacular show and it must have been fabulous to all of the people who were there, but I'm not really fond of all the 'stars' like Brian Adams or Cindy Lauper who just don't fit in.The Wall is a very good but also a very dark album, and it's not the right album to be played by a bunch of famous rockartists.Most of the time I skip to the parts that Waters sings, for me, these are the highlights.I really hope someday the original Wall-show (of '81) will be released on DVD of VHS."
5,Roger Waters At his Best!,One of the greatest live events I have ever seen! I am a big Roger Waters fan and the recent news that this concert will be released on DVD soon was the best that I have heard in a long time. Although there are a few artists at this show that dont live up to the songs I thought it was a mind blowing spectacular. Don't buy the video - wait for the DVD if you are lucky enough to own a DVD system. One of the best!
2,Only gave this 2 stars because they didn't have 1.5,"Being a huge Pink Floyd fan, I thought I would give this DVD a look. I was pleasantly suprised at the theatrics; they were spectacular. However, the music is NOT Pink Floyd, it's terrible! It made me realize that The Wall without Dave Gilmour is something to be skipped. The people they got to replace his singing were truly awful. Even the guitar didn't sound right. Gilmour has his own style that can't be duplicated, even with the fifteen spare guitarists they hired. To anyone considering this DVD, do the smart thing and wait for the Pink Floyd PULSE DVD, or hope they make a DVD of Pink Floyd ""Is There Anybody Out There? The Wall Live."""
2,"sorry, but it could have been better","ok, the sound is ok but some guests are really disapponting..and I'm not only talking about Cindy Lauper (?!). Some songs, like the trial sequence, are hugely reworked in studio, what you hear and what you see simply don't match !There are a lot of better DVD's around..buy them instead !"
1,Rog sells out.,The Wall is an untouchable masterpiece and Roger Waters let hacks do half of it!! I am a floydian but having Cyndi Lauper and Sinead O'Connor makes me sick. Rog was in this debacle for the cash!
3,Is viewing better than just listening????,"The music content of this SACD is excellent. However, the audio although very good, is presented essentially in concert mode. I would therefore suggest that viewing the concert on DVD (if available) would probably be a greater experience than just listening to the cd. That does not detract from the 'listenability' of this quality SACD."
5,Excellent gift for a Pink Floyd fan!,"The songs are performed by other artists, which is fine, some even do a great job. The spectacle of the concert in Berlin really brings alot to the dvd though. No regrets."
1,Rip-off,"I had hoped that this recording would include more Peter Green tracks from the original Fleetwood Mac days that I did not have. Instead, the only worthwhile tracks appear on other albums that I already have. The rest unfortunately are very disappointing. Peter was probably the best guitarist of that era and I was hoping to discover other tracks not previously seen. The marketing is a rip off because it emphasises Fleetwood Mac when the only track from that era is on the live `Blues Collection'."
3,A Rather Tame Offering,"There's probably no such thing as a bad Loop Guru cd. However, after hearing Duniya, I can't be faulted for comparing everything else to it. This one doesn't seem to have enough to grab me and make me listen to it. I find myself drifting and that's something I don't do when I'm listening to Duniya. So for some background music that's better than most of the garbage being produced, and, to hear a different side of Loop Guru, this cd is okay. I'm still waiting for something to knock me out like Duniya. None of their other cd's come even close."
5,Author's web site,You can find out more information about the author and the book at:http://main.nc.us/pinetreepress
5,Great Prodcut,Book arrived on time and in great condition for a used-very good listing. Good follow through from shipper. Would shop here again!
4,Like the Book,"If you are new to aircraft partnerships, this is a good place to start. Geza gives you food for thought by showing things that have gone wrong in other partnerships and how to prevent them in yours! I would have liked it if there was a CD or website where I could have gone and Cut & Paste some of the agreement language without having to re-type it in from the book as I was making my own agreement.A good starting point for anyone..."
2,Did anyone test this?!?,"I seriously wonder if they tested this with any actual Excel users. I gave it two stars only because there are some improvements over Excel 2003, but the new menu navigation is phenomenally flawed. I've been using it for several months and it still drives me nuts.Just one infinitesimal example to whet your appetite:I create a percentage by dividing one number by another. The result is 0.12961%. I don't want to see this many decimal places, so I open up the ""Home"" banner, click the ""Decrease Decimal"" icon and the number now reads 0.1296%. The banner has closed, so I must reopen the banner and again locate the ""Decrease Decimal"" icon and click it again. Now I have 0.129%. Repeat...Repeat...Maddening I must say."
3,Ok once you learn to use it,"I agree with the other reviewers. Once you are used to the ""old"" versions of excel, have fun learning to use this one. You can still use the old keyboard short-cuts (such as Alt+I, R to insert a row). There are some new features that are nice, but who is going to use them or how often?? There is no 'File' menu now...It is the windows icon in the top left hand corner. It took me ten minutes just to figure out how to print or save a file....now it is second nature, but I have been using it for several months. Not for the not-so-computer-inclined person. Not very user friendly. AND, you have to remember to save files as 'xls' instead of 'xlsx' type so other people can open them..."
1,Much harder to use than previous versions,"The ribbon system does not work. It takes much longer to find the function you are looking for. If it aint broke, don't fix it. Shame on Microsoft to try to get people to upgrade to this version. THIS IS NOT AN UPGRADE!"
1,Excel 2007 disappointment,Our company at GE is very disappointed with the new 2007 design. Everyone loves the older version with the dropdown menu's much better. Good try but no thanks. We feel the 2007 version brings us back to nursury school. Please change it back!!!Mike D & Company
1,The last good year of Excel 2003!!,"This is the worst product that Microsoft ever produced. If you ever used Excel before, you will be disappointed at this new Excel. It is so difficult to use. I have talked with many others and the production of power users have been cut in half. If I could have given this product a 0 ZERO I would have, because it doesn't deserve a 1."
4,Installation is a !!#%##**,"I would have rated this program 3.5 if that was a choice.As an experienced but semi-casual user I needed to upgrade from ""Home & Student"" ""Non-Commercial"" version to ""Full"" version in order to legally sell a program I've written.Installation was a REAL HASSEL !! Turns out one can't simply ""uninstall"" the Student version and install the Full version - as usual with Microsoft nothing is simple, however as the full version was recently purchased thus still under warranty, it didn't cost anything for the techs at MS to do the million things necessary to accomplish the un-new-install.Except for the ""Non-Commercial"" banner the versions appear identical. I will say the new ""ribbion"" way of accessing the functions takes a lot of getting accustomed to if one has a lot of experience with earlier versions such as '97."
4,Johnny Pasquale's review,"The Dark StairsA crime...With deduction of evidence or clues, no suspects or alibis, and no witnesses. Can this crime be solved by a little girl named Hercleauh? You might think it's impossible, but guess again. A man was looking for his dad, who vanished out of nowhere. He went to the Hercleauh's mom for help. Hercleauh snoops around the suspected murder scene. The second time she went deep in the house. Then she heard someone come, so she hid in the closet. In the closet she smells something and falls through the wall, helping her solve the mystery with a shocking twist. I thought this book was a good book. I think this because each chapter they get closer and closer to solving the mystery.By: Johnny Pasquale"
2,Herculeah??..ewww,"A plain-looking girl with the most horrible name a mother could invent EVER-Herculeah!-loves solving mysteries,and -I give the author credit that they don't just fall into Herculeah's lap from nowhere;instead she likes to solve the mysteries that her mum-a private investigator-is working on-she is trying to work out ifn escaped loony-bin patient is really dangerous.I would not buy another Herculeah mystery,although it was OK.I am also aware that this review inludes an abnormally long sentence.Oh well.Bye."
3,Mysteriously funny!,"I suggest that if you like scary books, this is the one. You will love this book if you like scary books. Herculeah is a trouble-maker and when she gets in trouble, you will have to read the book to find out what happens. Herculeah Jones is like Nancy Drew but better. --Katie Ayers, in Ms. Marik's 6th grade class"
5,Kennedy Owns Elgar,"I am no particular fan of Nigel Kennedy, even as I appreciate his new infatuation with romantic Polish composers from afar. But he owns the huge Elgar Violin concerto - and if a top choice would have to be made, it would be between his own two, inspired, accounts of it. This one is the first, with Handley and the London Philharmonic is from 1984 - the other from 1997 with Simon Rattle and the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra. Between the free-wheeling re-make (from a time when the soloist insisted being called just ""Kennedy"") and the attuned, precise, and generous Handley reading, the unbeatable price of this Classics for Pleasure re-issue might make the difference. Handley offers no filler, Rattle a leaden Lark (barely) Ascending.Another splendid version worth checking out is the recent Shaham/Zinman collaboration (CSO, no less!) on Canary Records."
1,Piece of Shoddy r@p,"We purchased this in June 2008 for use on our 2000 Nitro 185 Sport Fish & Ski. We wanted additional shelter from the sun at anchor or on the beach, without having to install permanent hardware.The first use of the sunshade, we noted that the guy lines intended to hold the shade steady did not have an easy method to secure or tighten. They have fixed rings at the end, rather than fasteners.The guy lines should be able to be adjusted and tightened while the shade is in place to ensure steady placement, and allow the shade to be raised or lowered.But that wasn't the worst of it.On the second usage, one of the plastic support arms for the shade snapped. Since that time we have not been able to obtain any support from either [catalog company] or Taylor Made. This piece wasn't worth the $165 (including shipping) we paid for it. I wouldn't recommend it under any circumstances."
4,Practical but fragile under outdoor conditions,I've been using Anchorshade only for a week but so far so good. Its light weight poses both an advantage and a disadvantage for me. It is easy to carry and move along from storage to deck and makes no trouble to mount it pretty fast but sometimes the shade twists under not-so-intense wind blows. We could not close it on the first day of use because we just could not release the locking button but I can not say if it was not damaged during our flight trip or else. I took extra care with the bottom pole as it may become a loose-rolling item if you drop it when mounting/dismounting the shade and I did not want it to end in the water.
1,Taylor made Anchor Shade,"The first time we used this product, one of the support arms (plastic) snapped and broke rendering it useless. We are still negotiating for a refund. We are very dissatisfied with this product."
3,Not what I expected,This book is full of rhymes. It taught my son to pee on the floor. I understand accidents happen but it can be confusing for kids so that part should have been left out.
3,"Entertaining, but not very instructional","My son loves this book, so I can't really give it a ""bad"" review. He loves the illustrations (especially the one where Henry has had an accident on the floor). But I wish that it was a little more 'instructional' for him. The book never discusses some really important elements of potty training, like wiping afterwards or washing hands. The cover of the book shows Henry playing with the toilet paper roll, but never shows toilet paper inside the book and never once mentions what toilet paper is actually for. I guess this is a good book for very beginning children who just need to be introduced to the very basic elements of just sitting on the potty."
3,Kids Like It But Unforgivable Grammar,"My kid likes this book a lot, and we also have the Potty Book for Girls. They are fun and popular. However my complaint is the grammar the books (and associated DVDs) use, including saying things like ""Teddy and me go off to the potty..."" I don't want my child learning to speak incorrectly -- why on earth should a kids' book or DVD use incorrect grammar?"
2,"Content Great, Kindle Flow Poor","This is a great book, and one of my favorites for my son. We often read the board, and I thought it might a great novelty to read it to him on the Kindle. This particularly, comes in handy when traveling.Unfortunately, the layout and flow is horrible. The pictures/words don't appear together. Sometimes the words are on one page, while the picture is on the next. Or the picture is shown, and the words are on the next page. It's very difficult to read."
3,Okay....,"This product was okay, my son was already out of diapers when we received it...So it would be a great book for people who are trying to potty train at an early age..."
3,I brought this in kindle version,My 2 year old son found this book engaging. He loves reading his own book on mums kindle. My only complaint was that the words didnt always fit on the same page as the appropriate picture.
4,Cute little book,"My son loved to read the ""potty"" book over and over again. I think it definitly helped motivate him towards using the potty. Anything to help the process is much appreciated. Good luck!"
1,Buy a different book!,This book sucks. It didn't keep my kids attention because the picture didn't look like a toilet or a potty seat. It looks like a blue circle. Get one of the lift a flap books instead--at least they have a real looking toilet and a kid that could be a boy or a girl--use it for more than one child. Don't bother with this one.
4,"Cute pictures, very appropriate.","I wanted a book that not only I could read to my son, but one that I would feel comfortable letting a baby sitter read to him. This gets the point across and doesn't go into a lot of detail about what body parts are named. I can read this as a regular story without my son even knowing I am ""teacing"" him. I like that."
2,not sturdy enough for a toddler,"I bought this thinking that it was a board book, I don't want my son to read it by himself because I am scared he will tear the pages. The pages aren't thick enough for him to turn himself so I don't think I will really use it."
4,great book,"MOther of an 18 mo boy, this book is great--however, I wish it didn't reference the word POTTY...but we just replace it with toilet throughout. My son seems to really enjoy it."
4,good for starting the potty talk,"This book is nice and basic and explains the very basic of starting to need to go potty. For example, starts with getting diaper changed then getting his own potty seat and wondering why he shouldn't use his diaper, then he tries and nothing happens, then he has a i didn't get there in time pee accident and a accident in his pants while playing then success and they then call grandma and shop for big kid underwear. The only dislike I have is it doesn't show Henry wiping or washing hands, but we just add those words into the book. My son loves it and calls it the Henry potty book."
5,Excellent way to mentally prepare your son for potty training,"My son is almost 3 and potty trained. His school did the majority of the work on this. Routine, Routine, Routine. But we prepped him as early as 18 months that he would be using his potty. He loved the book. ""Daddy, I wanna be like Henry."" That's what a parent wants... ownership, and the willingness to want to sit and go. :) Excellent book."
4,potty training,Cute story for little boys being potty trained. As a grandmother it is a story you can read to your grandsons.
2,dont buy it,"it just seems too detailed for a 2 or 3 year old to get into it. and the pictures are kinda odd looking, if i were i a kid i would be interested.. needless to say, my son loves books, and this book was not one he even tries to read."
4,A great first step to potty training,"My 20 month old son loves this book - any time of day, of course. He grabs his teddy bear and listens to us read it to him. I think it's a good introduction to using the potty, even though it does not teach wiping and hand-washing. He has used his potty only once, but I believe this book will help...eventually."
5,Great!!!,"My son just loves this book, can really identify with the story. The words all ryhme so it keeps little ones entertained to the end. Definitely recommend! And if you want the potty training to be fun and smooth, then I recommend this bookFun and Stress Free Potty Training Techniques"
4,Ready to Potty Train your little one?,"If you are ready to potty train your little one, then this book is for you. It is fun and easy to read and my kids love to read it over and over. The best part is that the story treats the child with respect, even when the inevitable ""accident"" happens. Highly recommended."
5,The Potty Book worked for us!,"When we were traing our daughter we tried everything and nothing was working until I bought The Potty Book for Girls. She loved it and shortly after reading it a few times she was motivated to use the potty just like the little girl in the book. Now that our son is starting to show interest in potty training, this is the first book I'm turning to. It's exactly like the one for girls only it's about a little boy. I'm hoping it will work for him just as well as it did for our daughter."
2,"Son loves it, I hate it","My son loves this book, especially the page where the little boy doesn't make it to the potty and pees on the floor. I have to read it multiple times a day. I hate it because the grammar is terrible, and the sing-song cadence is weirdly overwrought. If you are going to write a book that rhymes and has a ""time"" then keep it consistent. I stumble when I read it because it just doesn't flow. I know, weird criticism of a children's book, but frankly this is the only book I have any of these problems with. The last page gets me everytime- ""I'm off to the potty. No more diapers for me! And I feel great, I am proud of. . .ME!""Although I save most of my loathing for whatever you call this: ""My diaper's where I pee and poop morning, noon and night."" The contraction of ""is"" into ""diaper"" for the sake of cadence is just wrong."
3,This book not specific to boys,"This book is a decent book about getting a potty chair and learning to use it, but it is NOT specific to boys (which is what I was looking for). The only reference to ""For Boys"" is that the character is a boy however there is no discussion of how boys use the potty differently. My toddler is aware that mommy & daddy use the potty in different ways, and since I am a stay at home mom who does most of the potty training I thought it would be helpful for my son to read a book that embraced the similarities between him and his dad and how they use the potty. If it was simply a potty book I would have rated it higher."
2,Kindle edition,This review is for the Kindle edition.Unfortunately the pages are scanned in low quality black and white with pages not setup correctly for Kindle. Not worth the asking price.Hopefully the standard of older book conversions to Kindle improves.The book itself is just ok. No mention of washing hands etc.
3,son enjoys it,My son loves to read this book while sitting on the potty. It is ok with nothing inappropriate in it.
4,Potty Training,"This book is a great way to help children learn how to potty train. The child in the book serves as an example for the children, and makes it believable that other children also potty train. It is much easier for a child to relate to another child, rather than an adult. Also, having a book for boys, and a separate one for girls, is helpful for children to relate to their own gender's distinct functions. The wording of the book is simple and straight to the point, although it is a bit lenghty."
3,Not a book for single moms,"This book shows a boy (Henry) starting out in diapers, then acquiring new independent skills, like brushing his own teeth and choosing his own clothes. Then he gets a potty from Mommy and Daddy. The book goes on to document Henry learning to use his potty, complete with input from Mom and Dad. This is all well and good if you have a Mommy and Daddy household, but leaves out those of us with other family structures. No ethnic diversity in this story, either. The nuclear family featured is definitely Anglo."
1,the potty book,i thought this book would be a book to help you with training little boys.. boy i guess i didnt read the book outlined correctly. I didnt like it.
5,"Review of ""Teacher to Teacher""","This book was about a group of teachers who got together on their own time to form a class. These teachers met at least once a week to discuss the successes and failures that they experience throughout their classroom. The overall theme of the book and the meetings is collaboration. These classes are about discussion things like the trials and errors or creating a curriculum, multicultural issues in the classroom, classroom motivation, alternatives to working straight from the textbook, students vs. our personal lives, parents and grading. When I read this book, I felt as if I was a part of the class. I was very in tune with what the teachers were saying, because working in the school systems I am sympathetic with their failures and successes."
4,failed attempts at humor really stick to your brain,"I've been ahead throughout my chem 125 class. Their is a lot of really good information in these videos. The humor is really lame, but that's one of the great things about them; it's this aspect that makes the concepts stick to your brain. You won't learn chemistry with them alone, but they are a great when watched while taking a chem class.I realized that these videos were originally composed for vhs, but they could have easily added chapter menus when it was transferred to dvd format. The sound quality isn't all that great either."
1,worthless,"video is low budget, and wont play on most players, including my dvd. and its for free on pirate bay"
1,good quality but need to drill holes,"I just bought a new F150 and wanted this mat to protect the tailgate from my dogs when they jump in. There are screws in the tailgate that I thought would be utilized by the mat but that's not the case. The mat doesn't go all the way across my tailgate AND mainly the instructions say to drill about 26 holes in the tailgate! I don't understand how it is better to drill 26 holes in the tailgate to save it from scratches! Also, I should have paid better attention but this company charges a 20% restock fee. With shipping costs both ways I'll be lucky to get half of my $53. back when it's all said and done."
3,Its OK I guess...not really,"Tail gate mat is a little small,does not really cover tail gate good, and the fact you have to drill 26 holes into your truck tailgate, well you decide. I would use really good silicone instead of drilling alll those holes....If I go go back and do it all over. The mat is thick and very good quality...but I did not really like drilling the holes in a brand new truck."
2,yo don't get all it says you're going to get,"When ordering this product, it was described as being a Bedmat and Tailgate mat. I really only wanted the bedmat, so the tailgate mat was going to be a bonus. Actually, all you get is JUST the tailgate mat. I thought the price seemed low for both items and now I know why. I checked on other websites and it appears I wasn't cheated by Amazon...DeeZee is just very misleading with the description. I guess the old saying holds true...""If the price seems too good to be true, it probably is!"""
3,Useful but lacking structure and references,"What I was expecting from this book was a condensed, informative, and illustrated short story of the Greek civilization. The book does it, and remarkably well at times. However, it is poorly referenced and assumes the reader knows already a lot about Greek history It was not my case, and so it was very annoying to see references to concepts such as ""linear 1 writing"", without any explanation. The same happens with some parts of the maps and geography concepts. Sometimes, places such as the Peloponnesos peninsula are referred to in the text but not apparent in the maps. Again, maybe unnecessary for people who know them, but annoying for those who don't. In brief, it's a very good book that could easily deserve 5 stars after an improved editorial revision."
2,Penguin can do better,"With all the fine Classical scholars out there, why did Penguin pick an Egyptologist? The volume on Egypt isn't done by a scholar of Summerian history. His views are often dated, criticising or praising theories that are long since forgotten. A scholar like Peter Green could have made a fine book out of this."
2,Not so great..,"Most of these reviews refer to the text of this volume which I will admit I have hardly even skimmed. I purchased this for the maps, it is an atlas after all. Many of the maps are just fine. Clearly laid out and informative. However, there are a great number that span two pages and as most maps put their primary subject in the center you can probably guess where Greece is. Right in the seam where you cannot see it hardly at all. This seems to me to be an obviously bad idea. Penguin can do better and should."
3,Decent supplement,"Not a bad supplementary read to the history of ancient Greece. It has a couple of irritating elements, such as its preference for unfamiliar (even if more accurate) spellings of ancient names (for instance, ""Kleopatra"" instead of ""Cleopatra""). But, the point is the maps, and the maps are a great resource for someone studying the history of this period."
4,Makes Something Complicated A Bit Easier,"Sure, maybe Penguin waters things down a bit to much but when it comes to reading complicated primary texts or reviewing scholarly essays, sometimes you need something reliable, short, and to the point and this is it. Also, accompanying every section if a primary quote which I think is a nice touch, there are also good maps and some photographs. I am a fan."
2,nice photos but inaccaurate,"This bookis inaccurate in that it does not illustrate all of the greek world correctly. There's always a problem with the extand of the ancient Greeks, but everyone knows that Epiros, lower Macedonia, and the coastal part of thrace were inhabited by Greeks. One thing I loved about this little book, however, is the lovely photos and the clear outlines."
5,Fascinating and Engaging Study,"I'm currently doing a long paper on the cartography of Matthew Paris, and after slogging through ""The History of Cartography vol. 1"" this was a pleasure to read. Edson's prose is interesting and engaging, and she covers a wide range of sources, ranging from from easter tables to all types of medieval maps, in her quest to show the linkages between time and space in cartography of the Middle Ages. One of the best books I've read on the subject."
1,Why Bother?,"An utterly pointless and ultimately silly project, this CD of Sick of it All classics is a thing doomed to failure. Why anyone would want to buy this CD and not buy the actual SOIA CD's is beyond me. Only completists or fans of the bands on offer would be mildly interested, but I feel that actual execution of the material will leave a lot of people underwhelmed...unlike the original material from the original band which still maintains it's solid and driving force. None of the bands' efforts here remotely comes close to the Sick of it all versions and some efforst are particularly weak.Simply put, buy the originals."
1,Why bother?,"We all know SOIA is one of the best and most influential HC/Punk bands of modern times. Why bother with a tribute? Most of the bands butcher the songs and this is a poor intorduction to the band for anyone new to the band's material. I don't see the point w/ tribute CDs... only a few ever have been even 1/2 decent... like the 1st NATIVITY IN BLACK SABBATH TRIBUTE, that was great because you got to hear modern versions of those songs. The kind of music SOIA was playing back then is still relevant today, there is no real room to improve on any of their original songs/ideas because that genre of music really has had nowhere to go but down since. Some of the bands gave it the college try.. but most fail. Buy every SOIA album up to and including BUILT TO LAST and you'll be all set."
