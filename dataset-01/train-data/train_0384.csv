3,"Alright, at best.","Well, first off...I LOVED the idea. Struggling superheros was a great idea. It's something that seems so painfully obvious to exist in the comic books but you just didn't think about it.Ben Stiller was the only one I didn't like here. I just couldn't get into his character. The guy was pathetic. The rest though (Macy, Azaria, Garofalo) were great. William H. Macy and his ""fights"" with his wife were hilarious. Azaria and his mom, the same.Mystery Men, though boring at times, was pretty funny. Its a nice movie to watch if nothing on the rental wall looks good and you have nothing else to do that night."
4,I have never seen a skunk do that!,"This movie is so funny! Superheroes who use anger, a bowling ball, a shovel, flatulence, hokey spirituality, forks, 'invisbility' and non-lethal super-weapons: just what the world needs. And on top of all this, disco dancing thugs led by Eddie Izzard. How could this not be funny?The every day story of a superhero being captured by a superbaddie and the super-useless enlisting the dregs of super-society to save the city.There are marvellous touches. The skunk - watch for it, The Blue Raja's accent (and his mother's love for him), the Sphinx's cliches, the shrinking-gun (man those clothes are tight) and Tom Wait's gigolo for the elderley come weapons maker. There are also some nice twists, particularly Captain Amazing as an obnoxious attention-seeking superhero.This movie will make you laugh and it will probably make you dress up in a plastic sheet and a hoover-hose. No matter, you too can become a superhero - just make sure you find your special niche!"
4,"Mystery Men, a Mysterious Bunch","""You don't want to make me angry, you're opening a Pandera's box."" ""That's Pandora's box, you idiot."" ""Don't correct me, that makes me angry!""This and many more great exchanges are found on Mystery Men, and excellent take on the 'superhero' genre. Where everyone wants to be a hero, but really no one is. This film has many great laughs and a great way to enjoy the movie evening."
1,Stinker,"Another movie I hoped would be funny, but really wasn't. When I saw the trailer, I said to myself ""that's a movie I'd like!"" It was not to be.Ben Stiller is miserable, William H. Macy made a bad career decision, and the rest of the cast seemed like they really wanted to be elsewhere!"
1,"What a Load of Rubbish ... -1,000 stars","My boyfriend said it was funny and i had to see it, It was terrible, after 6 mins i wanted to leave, even Quiz Show was better than this movie and i left half way through that, unfortunatly i didn't get to leave this one, in the whole movie theater he was the only one that laughed.Not reccomened to anyone with a brain, sense of humour, or a life."
4,Mystery Stars,"Mystery Men is a weird, off-beat comedy not unlike the strange 80's classic, Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension. Want-to-be heroes try to make their way up to the popular status of fictional Champion City's current hero, Captain Amazing (Greg Kinear), an endorsement-clad, ego enhanced crime fighter. What are really interesting are the appearances of actors (of such caliber as Geoffrey Rush (Casanova Frankenstein) and artist such as Gnarls Barkley (singer of the pop hit ""Crazy""), comedian Dane Cook (Waffle Man), and director Michael Bay (one of the Frat Boys). Who knew?"
4,SAVING THE DAY,"MYSTERY MEN has as many misses as it does hits, but the hits are great, and a wonderful cast imbues this otherwise iffy comedy with vitality, life and a droll sense of humor. What makes it work is the actors take their roles so seriously and seem delighted to be in this movie. The real standouts are William H. Macy, Wes Studi, Geoffrey Rush, Greg Kinnear and of course, the Bowler Jeannine Garafolo. Although it sometimes slows down a little, it has some really inventive and hilarious segments and on the whole is a very entertaining spoof."
3,I can't believe they would do THAT to a superhero!,"I'm puzzled by the polarization of this movie. Lots of 5-stars, and lots of 1-stars, with very little in between. I found it something perfectly watchable and enjoyable. The interplay between the characters was good and well done. A director with some actual movie experience might have done a bit better, though.I think to give it 5-stars is insulting to truly great movies, but I can understand it not being everybody's cup of tea. It's fun. Rent it and enjoy it."
2,Not worth the time,"Laughed from time-to-time. The parody on comic book superheros was humorous, but the movie was lacking in keeping my attention."
1,Very Effective As A Sleeping Pill,"Bad beyond belief. I warn anyone interested in renting or buying this to think again. On paper, maybe it seemed like a good idea. Another high concept Hollywood movie gone wrong. Misfit superheroes attempt to rescue Captain Amazing, battle disco-loving bad guys, and try and save the city from Casanova Frankenstein (Oscar winner Geoffrey Rush!). The Mystery Men are guys with lame special powers such as fork-throwing and farting. The problem with ""Mystery Men"" is that it isn't funny or exciting. It parodies the Batman series (which didn't take itself seriously anyway), but doesn't contain any laughs or action scenes worth watching. The creators of this film concentrated on making it look good, hired a good cast, and then did nothing else. ""Mystery Men"" is a two-plus hour endurance test. The DVD has great picture and sound and contains an audio commentary by director Kinka Usher and deleted scenes, but who cares?"
1,Doesn't even deserve 1 star!,"This is by far the worst movie i have seen in a while. I think William H. Macy is an outstanding actor, but he gave off a stench of failure in this movie. I literally only laughed once, and that was at the beginning of the movie. From there on, it goes down hill. Where did they get the title Mystery Men to begin with? There is nothing mysterious about them at all. So a person can aim, and fart on command, and another thinks he can become invisible. This movie is absolutely horrible, and should not be viewed by any body between ages 1-150."
5,just a fun cut up movie,"Just a fun movie to watch stylistically and comically ;) I like Ben Stiller, Paul Rubens (I know then why not marry...), Baby Bowler, Simpson's voice guy and the rest in this in raucous romp of super hero falability. Because I wanna keep my teeth amazing...Jon @thinkingdudes(I got to use raucous in a sentence, booyah!)"
2,Silly movie,"Mystery Men is a silly movie which I purchased because of it's low price of $2.49. In the ""Zombie"" genre, it really doesn't rank highly, in my humble opinion. Amazon did a great job at getting to me in a timely manner."
4,Batman is NOT home...,"It was funny. That's all - it was hysterically funny. A nice take on the Dark Horse series. If you're looking for Batman or Superman, don't bother. But... for a good time, you can call these guys. Greg Kinnear provided one of his best performances, and Macy was the perfect... shoveller. Saw it, loved it...I laughed, and then I laughed some more."
4,"Good movie, if you don't mind off-color humor","Short and sweet: if you don't mind off-color humor, see this movie. Rent it, buy it, whatever you like. It's absolutely mindless humor. Paul Rubens' character, for example, has the superpower of farting.The DVD features are fairly standard stuff -- outtakes, an alternate ending, theater trailers, and director commentary. The commentary is actually fairly interesting, and spills the beans about all sorts of on-the-set humor that went on.Sit back, relax, and laugh until it hurts. Then watch it again, looking for all the references to pop culture and other films in true B-movie style."
3,Very funny,"Very funny, witting, satire about a band of superheroes trying to save the ultimate superhero, Captain Amazing (Greg Kinnear). This band of superhero's includes Mr. Furious played by Ben Stiller, The Bowler played by Janeane Garofalo, The Shoveler played by William H Macy and many more. The whole concept of this movie is humorous, but the movie wasn't as good as I thought it would be. Don't get me wrong, it's a great comedy adventure. But, just not the best movie ever. If you like Monty Python, you'll love this. This is the same kind of humor. Also stars Geoffrey Rush, Paul Reubens, Hank Azaria, Eddie Izzard, Artie Lange, and Claire Forlani. Just see this one for the fun of it, it's a fun film."
2,"Good for a chuckle, little else","The best thing I can say about ""Mystery Men"" is that I did not injure myself getting it out of my DVD player. It has good direction and set design, and decent performances, but far, far too few funny bits to support it's running time. Perhaps if you watch the movie in 30 minute segments it won't be so bad but if you do it all in one sitting you will be bored. There are definitely some entertaining parts but they are buried under lots of dull set-up. A good movie for a lazy Sunday afternoon where there is not so much pressure to get all of one's entertainment from ""Mystery Men"" alone."
1,Staggeringly bad,"There are dozens of clever, offbeat films worth watching, but this isn't one of them.This was the worst movie I have seen since Robert Townsand's Meteor Man."
3,An Interesting Cast Makes the Film Better,"With all honesty we know this film would have been like gum underneath a shoe if it hadn't been for the cast. The story is nonexistent, the dialogue a joke and the plot...well you get the picture. The best part of Mystery Men is how the cast is so colorful they come together to rescue what would otherwise be a disastrous movie. This is not a film you can easily recommend to anyone. It's not a film that's so black and white you can classify it so it's truly up to people's tastes whether they should see it or not. I bought it in 1999 and have watched it about ten times since then. It's a good film to watch if you're bored but I can't say it's so wonderful you should run out and buy it. Just wait to see it on television. You'll enjoy it better when you save your money. It's entertaining even if the story centers around a bunch of funny, yet weird morons."
2,Not the worst movie I've ever seen....,"...but close.Sorry to all those people who found this an entertaining movie, but I thought it was a big pile of steaming poo.Saying that, I have watched it twice. It was better the second time around because I expected to find the film rubbish, and so was pleasantly surprised at a few points.It's a real shame though, because when I saw the trailers in the cinema for this movie, I thought ""I gotta get that, it's going to be hilarious"". It promised so much, and delivered next to nothing in return.You could buy worse, but not much."
1,What was it all about?,"I am a comic book enthusiast, i try to collect as many superhero comic as possible. I saw the trailer to this film and thought wow! what a great idea. Superhero's without any powers. I went out and bought it on DVD. Well, what a surprise it was when i watched it. It was one of the unfunniest films in history. Some of the concepts were great but it didnt make the grade. Rubbish im afraid. Thats all i can say. Kids may enjoy it."
5,Some reviewers here don't get the joke,"Mystermen wasn't made for the casual movie goer looking for a 90 minute diversion. It's for comic book and superhero fans. It's a type of spoof (although a loving, respectful and intelligent spoof) of the superhero movies and books I love. To watch it ""out of context"" must be a bad experience. To watch it ""in context"" makes it a favorite of mine. I love Myster Men."
4,Don't take it too serious,"Just like any comedy you can't take things to mental. Think of it in terms of a Superhero version of Napoleon Dynomite, Better off Dead, or Strange Brew. Just a story of some misfits trying to find their place in the world, and in the process not screw it up too bad.If you go into it looking for a Lord of the Rings, Batman type story where the world is normal with these few laughs mixed in you are in the wrong place. This is bizarroland. Always something odd going on in every corner of the movie.Right from the start it throws you into the oddest scene in the movie, an old persons party, with syncronized power wheelchairs, and blue haired old grannys. It starts to normalize (if you can call it that) as the movie goes on.The would be hero's are frustrated that their powers are second rate, but they believe in each other, and in what they are doing. Not saving the world, but saving their corner of the block. Thier eyes are on the prize of the big save.It was great."
3,"""Super hero satire""","I am going to go ahead and give this one 3 stars. Yes it's dumb, yes it's formulatic but it is also fun. The movie pokes fun at super heros in general, although I think Batman takes the brunt of it. It laughs at secret identities and how a pair of glasses is sure to fool anyone. This film is just a lot of dumb laughs and you can't help yourself but enjoy it. So you may like this one ( although you may not want to admit it to your friends). I am leaving out anything about the plot because they do a good job of it if you read up above."
4,Disco Boys,"Dude, it's all about the Disco Boys. Having Claire Forlani is a plus as well. They are the ""real deal"" heroes that don't get to play in the big leagues like Batman and Superman, but they still are heroic and get the job done. Even though they make fun of the superhero genre, at least they did it with pinache."
2,Captain Amazing Meets Major Disappointment,"I laughed exactly four times in this film. I kept waiting for Garofalo and Stiller to break loose, but the script seemed to be so wrapped up in too many characters, someone forgot to add jokes. I was very disappointed with all involved."
4,Fun take on he superhero genre,"This is a interesting take on the superhero genre. What few powers are actually presented here are not spectacular - Kel Mitchell plays a boy who can turn invisible... only when no one is looking, and Janeane Garfalo has a bowling ball which houses her dad's spirit. Many of the superheroes don't have real powers, but this movie is an entertaining flick nonetheless and spoofs the superhero vs supervillian genre."
4,Movie with no real plot,"This is an interesting movie. If you like Ben Stiller comedy (NOT COMEDIC ROMANCE) you are sure to like this. GREAT CAST, OK STORYLINE, AND WORST BADGUY...perfect movie for the geek in your life..."
3,america's critic,"this is a film that quite entertaining has sum funny parts in it this is a renter or a one or 2 time watcher, the story was interesting but not like other films out."
4,"Funny, quirky movie","This movie is definitely eccentric, but all the funnier for it. The characters are quite unlikely but make us feel all the more normal by being more like us than we expect. Many humorous moments and great quotes."
3,Enjoyable Superhero Comedy.,"Mystery Men looked like a cool movie for a Sunday night. It turned out to be a pretty good watch, nothing I'd care to see again, but still lots of silly, far-fetched fun at the time.The cast clearly had a good time, and a great team it was too - Ben Stiller, Hank Azaria, Greg Kinnear, Willam H. Macy and Janeane Garafolo are all on super form - and they've chosen a pretty fun movie to get a break away from all their hard work recently. There are a lot of imaginative scenes, colourful set pieces and an awesome soundtrack adds to the bonus. But, it's not all good. Mystery Men is overlong for a superhero flick, some of the actors unclear voicing becomes irritating and there is some messy cinematography. If not classically hilarious or memorable, Mystery Men is undemanding fun which most audiences will enjoy.Mystery Men: B-"
1,Not even Janeane can save this one,"Even if ( as always ) Ms Garofalo shines above the material, here the material is just not very funny. This is one of those movies that simply confirms that Ben Stiller is only funny in about 10% of what he does. i.e. in ""Meet The Parents"" and nothing else. The beautiful Claire Forlani is practically wasted as Stiller's ""lurve"" interset."
1,Worst movie ever,"Not only is the plot boring and predictable, it's not even funny. Unless of course you enjoy people farting, making obscene gestures without any context or just like bad movies, you shouldn't consider this. There are much better movies playing along the same line (Austin Powers!) with much more brainwork involved."
2,No case for the movie!!,"I picked up the movie for pretty cheap, but it took around 9 days to receive and all i got was the disc with no case."
3,Average for any genre.,"The couple of times I've watched this movie I have enjoyed it, but it's very predictable in humor and plot. I could see many of the plot ""twists"" coming a mile away the first time I saw it. But all of the actors clearly enjoy their roles, and their enthusiasm can be quite infectious. To me, the best character is The Bowler, although I thought The Shovel was pretty cool too. Both of them had excellent lines and weapons, although his was a little more obvious in its uses. Hank Azaria as The Blue Rajah was funny but his choice of weapon seemed to have been chosen ""last minute"". Mr Furious never really did anything, and The Spleen was just disgusting. Still, fun movie with interesting characters. Never going to be on any of my lists of favorites, but I could watch it a couple more times."
2,so not funny?,"Like a lot of Ben Stiller movies, you wonder who is writing thisstuff? People who laugh at their own pull my finger jokes?Not so superheroes take on the rescue of a captured heroonly to roast and toast him.The Incredibles (Full Screen 2-Disc Collector's Edition)is much better than this without making complete fools of the actors involved.Somebody ought to tell these people to run it by some people first?This was just an ugly movie for me."
3,"It's okay, but...","It's okay... as far as movies based on comic books go. It's nowhere near the quality of the Michael Keaton Batman movies. However, it does have its amusing moments. Were it not for Ben Stiller and William H. Macy, though, this movie would completely and totally suck."
1,will temporarily lower your IQ,"This has got to be the stupidest movie ever made. Please don't say ""I didn't get the joke...."" I got them, understood the punchline and didn't even crack a smile. I love comedies and the trailer for this film was so hilarious, I couldn't wait to see this film and paid full price the day it came out. It was all I could do to sit through this thing, faithfully expecting it to be a comedy as advertised. STUPID, STUPID, and more STUPID. I could see people at a party who were pretty snockered getting a kick out this movie now and then, but your senses must be sufficiently dulled by large amounts of alcohol or a severe head-trauma to find this amusing.Save your time & your money and flee from this foul stench of a film."
1,a big bag of stinky wind,"This movie looked expensive, but it was cheaply done. Poor screenplay, bad timing. No laughs, whatsoever. The entire audience seemed like they were in a coma when I saw this in the theater..."
1,this movie is terrible,The title of my review pretty much sums it up. There were a total of about two amusing parts in the entire movie.
4,The Spleen Lives!,"When I heard about this movie, the thing that grabbed me the most was Paul Reuben's character the Spleen. As a big Pee-Wee fan, I had to at least give this a chance. But if you want to know what his super power is, you have to pull his finger.The Spleen did not disappoint. Neither does this movie. I was pleasantly surprised with the whole package. Good acting when good acting is necessary, nice story, great premise. Good directing, too, almost Burton-esque. Indeed, there was a rumor that Tim Burton really did direct this, but I don't really believe it.It kept me laughing. If you're anything like me, it will you too.But most people aren't anything like me."
4,"This picture, you've got to watch","Surprising, at start; then the magic operates.Very good entertainment picture. Original, refreshing, very funny, and suitable for all the family ( no hurting scenes ) but loaded with rythmn.Very recommended"
2,Mystery Men a real mystery,"The only mystery (excuse the pun) to me is why several DVD and film review magazines rated this film quite highly. With a strong comedy cast (Stiller, Garafalo etc...) I had high hopes for a great film. Sadly this film turned out to be a big let down. The comedy fell into two ballparks, blatantly obvious slapstick and subtle comedy thats so subtle its not even there. Theres one high point though, and thats the nonsical and nihilistic philosopher The Sphinx. His cliched sayings are the biggest and only laughs in the whole film. The quality of the DVD transfer is very high, and the added extra are quite varied (deleted scenes, origin of chars etc...). If you collect DVDs for collection sake then you'll probably get this no matter what I say, but if you are into good comedies hire it on video or DVD before you decide to add it to your collection."
2,Not as funny as the preview...,"After seeing the preview for Mystery Men in the theater, I couldn't wait to see it. I'm a fan of Ms. Garofalo, and who can doubt the creative genius that is Hank Azaria...However, something intangible was glaringly absent from this movie. The classic excuses for being bad spring to mind: It was too long. The jokes didn't ""click."" The pace was too slow. Something...I can't say exactly what caused me to take this DVD out of the player and put it back in the case, but I will say that I grew tired of the movie before I made it to the end.Even though I had ample time to finish watching the movie, I returned it... unfinished to the video store... without a guilty conscious.My time, in my opinion, was better spent in other ways..."
1,"really, really, really, really, really, really, really, BAD!","Sitting through this movie was like torture. I'm not sure what went wrong. They had a good budget, a good premise/idea and great comedic talent and still this movie was like watching grass grow, minus the time-lapse photography. Jokes that just aren't funny unless you're dead drunk and one dumb joke after another, with long pauses of nothing inbetween."
1,Deserves a goose egg,"This was a horrendous flick. Slow moving, delayed punch-lines and waste of money and talent on what was obviously poor direction and/or screenplay. The Oscar goes to the editor who put the trailer together making this appear to be a well-timed comedy. Bravo for talking me out of my $7. What a load of garbage this film was. This is the last time I go to a movie when it first comes out. There was a big reason this was in theaters for less than a month... word of mouth spreads like wild fire. Yuck yuck yuck. I feel like I must warn the world about what a waste of time it is to sit through this torture."
5,Hysterical and very Art Deco!,"This film is really special. It's not some low budget comedy movie but it's a mix between Batman, Seinfeld and Austin Powers, an overall bizarre combination!I really like the part when Stiller jumps on the badguys' car and tries to scratch the label off! LOL!If you really want to give yourself a break and indulge in some innocent childish fun you should watch this movie."
1,mysteriously awful,"I'm not sure how great comedic talents like Paul Reubens, Garafolo and Stiller ended up in a lame duck like this... it's a mystery to me, but horrid nonetheless."
3,Disco is not dead.,The movie promised much and didn't really deliver. However I did find enough amusing moments to make the film watchable. Rush is excellent as the villain and the stretch stingring is kinda cool. But for me the coolest thing had to be the disco gang. A gang of evil thugs who are all into disco. The movie is silly but that is really the point. Don't take yourself too seriously is the catch cry of this film and for that reason alone give it a watch.
2,uh oh...,"Whatever excellent features this polarizer has were totally ruined by the fact that the lens cap would not fit onto the lens, once this polarizer is in place. I use Nikon lenses, and all of them have circular polarizers, and admittedly most are Nikon polarizers, and all will allow the lens cap to fit over them. After 28 years using polarizers on all my lenses I had yet to run across one which would not accept the lens cap. Which means that a person has to remove the polarizer to replace the lens cap.... not amusing out in the field, or anywhere for that matter. The attributes of the thing seem excellent - appearance, construction, optical quality, value - all good. But not accepting the lens cap is a deal breaker for me. If you only use a polarizer occasionally, I suppose you wouldn't be bothered by this, but I keep them attached to my lenses nearly 100% of the time."
3,"OK read, but not exceptional","Maximillian Wells have decided it's time to marry, and he knows just the lady that will suit him : Pandora Effington, also known as the Hellion of Grosvenor Square. Although the lady is well known for her rebellious actions and having caused a lot of duels, she has decided never to marry - unless for love. They agree to a bargain where Max will have to pass a test (The twelve labours of Hercules) in order to marry her. If he fails, Pandora will name his bride.Having already read 2 other books by the same author, it feels like the stories have been repeated. Especially when it comes to the development of the lovestory. This is particularly evident at the end of the book, because it seems that it has been prolonged by at least 50 pages too much. Apart from that I find it very entertaining and a good book for lazy holidays."
4,Great hero wooes a streotypical heroine.,"Obviously the hero Max has been shortchanged.""The Wedding Bargain"" is a funny, light, and enjoyable read. I do enjoy the way Max overcome the 12 Labors of Hercules, and that man's arrogance can be pure seduction. ""You need a hero. Me."" Oh yes indeed.But the heroine's a stock Bluestocking Cliche. It's either I have a sudden gift of sixth sense, or the heroine's predictable, from her mounting guilt over ""troubling"" Max to her getting jealous over Max's ""affair"" with her best friend to... everything she says and does really. ""The Hellion of Grosvenor Square"" is a fraud.""The Wedding Bargain"" is light and sweet, but like candy floss, it could also use more substance, especially in the heroine department."
4,Ah the games woman play,"While I generally don't like to see women play games to win a man, Pandora's character begins her games in a way that is engaging and entertaining. There does come a point at which you just want to say, oh give it up already.... but just as you say that, the heroine herself begins to question the game as well! Great timing, witty dialogue"
1,Very disappointed!,I loved the bracelet until the pearl fell off! I had my husband put the pearl back on and again it fell off and this time I was in Arizona on vacation and never did find the pearl! I would not and will not buy nor recommend this product to anyone with the lack of quality I experienced with this purchase!
2,Ok But Not The Best Source For Cloth Diaper Information,"Like most of the other reviewers I found myself hoping this would be a thorough source for everything involving cloth diapers. The book did have some information, but for the most part it was outdated and very biased. Being a new mom and wanting to find a single unbiased informative source for cloth diapering this was definitely not it.Luckily when I ordered this title I also purchased a instructional diaper DVD, Everything Cloth Diaper. This product was great because it covered different types of cloth diapers and brands so you could see all the diverse options. I think the best part was all the instructions on diaper folds. Actually watching someone do it in front of you as opposed to trying to follow drawings made the whole process alot less frustrating. If you want to purchase this book it does have some helpful info, but overall I enjoyed the DVD much more."
3,Diaper Changes great for first-timers to cloth,"Diapering Changes has much information on what's available to parents today. In the past there were only a few options for parents, mostly pin-on diapers that required a lot of folding. Diapering Changes helps the new parent choose what type of diaper is best for them, and offers an extensive listing of companies that sell cloth diaper supplies, very important since high-quality diapers are usually not available in stores. One note is that the author's descriptions of home washing are much more difficult to follow than the method most mothers use. Additionally, the author recommends cleaning methods for the non-circumcised boy which conflict with the official position paper of the American Academy of Pediatricians."
5,Fantastic resource!!,"When baby number 4 came along, we decided to go with cloth diapers. Reading Diaper Changes has actually solidified our commitment. The information on the benefits of cloth are great, and the resource listings are really wonderful. I am currently using the suggestion to recycle old wool sweaters into old fashioned soakers, and loving it!! This book is a must for every parent, no matter how many kids they have had!! I wish I had had it before my first was born almost 9 years ago!!"
5,Historical fiction filled with romance and adventure,Herbert Quick's story of a young man growing up on the Erie Canal and his pioneering trip through Wisconsin and on to the Iowa prairie is a great read. His trip is filled with romance and adventure and the descriptions of the pioneering life are wonderful. I highly recommend it to all.
3,Interesting but...,"Found the Erie Canal section the most interesting, perhaps because I was unfamiliar with that history. The Iowa section eventually devolved into the typical frontier romance, complete with the stock characters long known in the movies. But the book may have been the prototype. When is SUI bringing the other books back?"
2,A poor Girls Gone Wild,A poor Girls Gone Wild should tell you everything you need to know. Save you money.
1,Defective upon reciept,"Don't think Amazon had much to do with it however after receiving the unit and seeing some suspicious marks on the plug, bench testing reviled a faulty ground circuit. Since the unit is suspended by rubber bushings the ground has to be internal to the harness and without it you get nothing from the unit. You'd think A-1 might spend a couple of bucks on the packaging considering the $135+ retail price. Maybe it's just better to play the odds that most of them will get through the system and last the 30 days. Pathetic. Thanks for wasting my time."
4,"Nice mixture of styles, and a brutal singer","This album is a mixture of hardcore, metalcore and swedish deathmetal. Overall you can say this a more swedish deathmetal inspired album, and for me that was kind of a dissapointment, because i hoped to hear more hardcore and metalcore inspired songs like ""weapon they fear"". So 4 stars for me instead of 5.The best songs on this album are;2. Weapon They Fear3. Only Truth6. Numbing the Pain"
4,good death metal,"it didnt blown my mind, but it is very agressive, very angry, and it has very catchy guitar riffs. For that It gets an extra star"
2,Not a good vacuum for carpet,"This vacuum sucks, but not very well. It doesn't pick up anything on our bad-quality apartment carpet. It's hard to push and messy to empty. We purchased it because it looked easy to store. However, our carpets are a mess and my husbands begging for a new vacuum."
3,Its alright.,"I feel like some of the topics, although true, are not as up to date as they could be. Also, some of the chapters seem to be written from a bias perspective rather than a neutral, objective standpoint so some things were annoying to read about when you don't agree with them. Overall, it is good for anyone interested in overall health as it is very broad and outlines the basic concepts of a healthy lifestlye throughout the life cycle."
5,Health book for college course,This book was used in a prior college course. Has a great deal of helpful information concerning health. Very interesting and helpful.
5,Great pop!!!,"This is some great pop from the midwest, a serious classic in Detroit (where I come from) and Ohio. They have great flavors like Grape, Red, Rock N Rye, and Cream Soda. I miss it so much now that I live in Arizona and I have never found anything comprable to it.I can't believe this retard who left a bad rating, but never tasted it before. Maybe he should get a clue and look up what REVIEW means in the dictionary. Is it that serious just to say that you have reviewed that many items on Amazon? SMH"
5,can't stop listening,Had to listen twice to get the whole experience. I think this cd is one of the best I've heard. I like the way he mixes both country and rock. My favorite song is rusty nail which I think is very powerful.
1,The Emperor's New Clothes,"I am amused by the bowing and scraping in the other reviews on this piece. They are the product of what I have always called ""The Emperor's New Clothes Syndrome."" These reviewers are simply afraid of perhaps revealing a lack of erudition or understanding if they say that Berkoff's treatment of Wilde's SALOME is just asinine. I am an actor with approximately 160 plays and musicals under my belt in addition to some 80 opera productions, and from both the standpoint of the performer and the viewer I feel quite confident in saying that this production is utter drivel. Wilde would be spinning in his grave, and justifiably so. All this directoral nonsense overlaid on a magnificent script is pathetic. Even Richard Strauss had better sense than to take such liberties with the piece."
4,Pete WAS the law among 1970s salsa soneros!,"This 1979-released set was Pete's most explosive album. Backed by atruly fiery rhythm section (check out the fiery, dynamic trumpet solos and hard-hitting percussion section on the title track,""Cabildo"" and ""Las Chicas De Venezuela""), this was New York salsa at its rawest and finest simultaneously. Like any true, inspiring sonero,Pete's vocals are both raw and refined."
4,Great introduction to Pilates,"Mind and Body Mat was my introduction to Pilates. I do it after 30 minutes on my exercise bike and find it gives me a feeling of well-being. The instructor is thorough and encouraging- and you can do a little more each time, as you get better at it. The breathing technique helps to deliver oxygen to all your muscles, and as a result, you are not sore when you finish. The end of the tape has a wonderful stretching session. I recommend this tape if you are interested in trying the Pilates method."
1,AWFUL,I didn't enjoy this tape at all. She was difficult to follow and the editing was very distracting. I was very disappointed in this video.
2,Don't buy this if you're new to Pilates,"The only good part about this video was the short little workout in the middle. The beginning part was okay and necessary, but the ending stretching thing was stupid. I'd prefer it if there was more mat work in the video, actually now that I'm familiar with it I don't even watch the beginning or end of it. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone, it's dull."
1,Awful waste of money,"I exercise regularly and part of my routine is the use of fitness videos. I own several Yoga videos so I beleive I have a good basis of comparison. This video was awful and expensive too (compared to the Yoga Journal series). Hilary's queing was OK for the first mat work section although it was difficult to know when to inhale and exhale. You are well into the video before Hilary mentions that you will need a towel, weight and bar. They should put that in the video description. The worst part was the ""Power Stretch"" where the was NO queing at all. How can you follow along!? It was great if you want to watch her dance. I wanted a video I could work along with."
2,"Mind, Body, Refund!",This disapointing video was not the introduction to the Pilates experience I had hoped for. The production quality is poor (filmed in the author's living room)and the number of exercises showcased is scant at best. Even the few movements we see are not shot well and the author's instructions are occasionally unintelligible because she brushes against her clip-on mic. Definately not worth your time and especially your money.
4,"More flexibility, more energy and muscle tone","Good video for introduction to Pilates. Focus on ab muscles great and you begin to feel it the next day. A few of the movements could be a little more detailed, but overall very well explained. You don't need additional equipment to do these exercises - but a mat is very helpful."
3,Hilary Burnett's Mind Body Mat,"I found this video to be a great disappiontment. Like a B rated movie. The audio is poor and the material is only fair. I think it will sell because it has the word ""Pilates"" in the title. It appears the instructor is a beginner herself. She seems exhausted or strained while doing curtain exercises and her form is off. I think Karen Vioght, The Method videos and the videos from The Pilates Studio would be a much better chioce for anyone truly interested in The Pilates Method."
5,Lighthouses of Lake Michigan,This book is fantastic. It gives you great information about the history of each of the lighthouses around Lake Michigan and reasons why some may have changed over the years. The pictures are great! It is also one of the few books that I have come across that is so complete. I also like how he included the status of each light and how to access it. I hope the author does another book like this about Lake Superior.
5,If you want to play D&D vikings. this is the book for you,"The best book ever written to turn your D&D characters into vikings is ten years old, and counting. (Stay away from the new Ragnarok book from Avalanche Press). Want new character classes? Here you go. Want a scenario for an up-and-coming Viking? Here you go.The only problem is that it is not ready for d20, but the necessary updating will help you get your viking campaign off the ground. Buying ""Greenland Saga: The Lost Norse Colony"" from Avalanche Press will help you in this regard."
2,Barely rises from the muck of obscurity,"This is not a good book. If you want to govern a Viking-esque campaign, I would advise you to get several books on Norse history and literature, but not this God-awful thing. The culture is presented in such a quaint way that unless I knew that the mediocrity was TSR's fault, I could swear that the Vikings led the most tedious lives in the world. The rune magic system is unwieldy and repulsive ( indeed, the only time I remember it being called upon is the fact that it is used by the Ice Linnorm dragons from the First Annual Compendium Appendix). Use your imagination rather than falling into this out-of-stock trap."
2,sent in bad condition,the book was bent and had stickers stuck to it. it was just sent in bad condition and the packaging was subpar. i was not pleased. the actual book was great though.
2,Not one of Thompson's best...,"Usually I like Thompson's stuff, but this book left me wanting. I couldn't help the overall feeling that the heroine just wasn't good enough for the hero. I still felt that way at the end of the book as well. There was just too deep a chasm between the two. He was patient, mature, responsible and understanding. Though he wasn't the most intuitive, he was sensitive. She, however, was stubborn, self-absorbed and had a ridiculously awful habit of not listening. She literally steamrolled right over-top of him trying to talk many times in the book. It was much like an adult man dating a needy teenage girl. I was underwhelmed overall."
4,"The good beginnings of ""El Mayimbe""","Antony Santos' first album consisted of many ""pericoripiaos"", or bachatarengues that really bring you into his world. However, ""Voy Palla"", ""Ya encontre mi hembra"", and my favorite, ""Te vas amor"" are true ""I adore you"" songs that I personally like. This album gave us his roots as to how big a superstar he would become, and still is today."
3,backwards is not right,"i wish i could just have the first bw cd by itself in the correct order.though i'm happy to have his songs on cd, the song sequence here is terrible."
4,Good read!,"I really enjoyed this book. It was a quick read, and really tugged on your emotions throughout the story."
5,A lovely debut novel,"Dear Zoe, the debut novel of author Phillip Beard, is one of the loveliest books I've read in years. In turns sweet and humorous, this is the story of 15-year-old Tess DeNunzio, who is not only coping with growing up, but also with the death of her young sister. Beard lends weight to the latter, while creating joy and fun with the former. If you want to laugh out loud, read the account of how much time--and effort--it takes for Tess to do her hair and make-up in the morning. Beard is, astonishingly, able to write in the voice of a teenage girl in a way that is both moving and true. I loved this book, and was sorry when it was over."
3,makes good coffee but wearing out after 4 years,"This unit makes good strong coffee but the vacuum seal between top and bottom is wearing out. It now leaks air when the coffee is draing back down to the bottom again. This greatly slows down the process. I can't find a replacement seal for sale. Something as expensive as this should be quite a bit more durable.I'm surprised at peoples' negative comments regarding cleaning. It's actually quite easy. I rinse it with water before using to get out the old grounds. The pot darkens over time. To get it all crystal clear again, I leave it full of water with a spoonful of oxyclean overnight. In the morning it's clear. No bottle brush needed.As for keeping he coffee hot, I just dump it all in a thermos. Warming coffee in a coffee maker is not the way to go anyway. You wind up with bad coffee."
1,Two thumbs down. It's overpriced crap.,"Okay, I didn't pay much for my Bodem Clear Santos. Got it a garage sale for $2. A couple of months ago. I wouldn't buy another, I don't think much of this coffee maker.It's a messy machine to use. The clean up of the upper chamber is just a pain in the butt. That would be okay, I guess, but it doesn't make good coffee and wastes a lot of grounds. The coffee it brews is weak and thin. For me to get a decent cup of coffee, it takes 7 coffee measures (about 7 tablespoons) to get anything out of a full pot of coffee.It's very entertaining to watch, tho. And I find that if I pre-wet the grounds with a mug of very hot water, it does improve the taste of the coffee. And for making boiling hot water for tea or cup o noodles, it is among the fastest!!!Guess I'm a philistine, I going back to my Gevalia Krups drip coffee brewer."
1,Bodum Santos Mini,"Having used various glass coffe pots thru the years including Silex with the hot plate, which I still own and cherish, I was enthused when the""mini"" came out due to the durability aspect.Ihave used it every day for about two weeks, I find the cord very stiff and not convenient to ""cram"" into its' slot. The upper bowl is easy to keep clean from coffee residue, how ever the bottom bowl is a NIGHTMARE to clean since some of the electricalis concealed in it. My small hand will not fit thru the lip opening to cleanse the bowl with ease, coffee residue and soap suds catch under the lip, coffee residue seeps between the area where the bowl is attached to the part of the heat unit.Needs to go back to the drawing board to come up with an immersible carafeThe only redeeming quality is a Great cup of coffee, I no longer use my Bodum."
2,Oh my God?!,"I plugged it in and followed the instructions and it erupted coffee and grounds through the vents all over the counter! It is fast, too fast and the coffee is hot but not measurably better than my drip coffee maker. It seems to have quite a bit of sediment. Perhaps I need a coarser grind. Lest you think me a novice, I roast and grind my own coffee. This may not be worth the trouble."
3,"Sleek, Good-looking, and Affordable model it is, but...","I was impressed the first time this baby brewed the coffee. It is fun watching the vacuum process, but no fun to clean up. To get a decent strong cup, you have to pour in more coffee than average and this makes me stop more frequent at the coffeeshop. Unfortunately, my unit performed great the first time, but it failed later on and just spilled the coffee all over my kitchen (I guess it had something to do with temp-controller inside that heats the water way too hot)..That's why I gave it 3 stars."
1,"Nice conversation piece, but falls short everywhere else","I must admit when I first saw one of these I said to myself I had to get one. If you're one of the thousands of people who have neighbors over for coffee and conversation it is sure to spark discussion for a minute or two, but it stops there. There are a few shortcomings to this. The coffee it makes is ok, not great, quite frankly other ones I've owned including Krups, Black and Decker and Cuisinart make better cups of coffee. The Bodum doesn't burn your coffee because it shuts off after about 15 minutes, but then how do you keep what's left hot? You need to use a separate insulated carafe. Next problem is cleaning it. You need a bottle brush and you have to be very careful not to scratch the clear plastic pot not to mention you can't get the bottom wet because of the metal contacts to the heating element. For the money, you are better off buying a full featured coffee maker with an insulated carafe like I did. This one is just a gimmick."
2,Great watch but high maintainence,"THis watch is sweet first of all, but...after about a year the band needed replacing. No problem I thought. Well not very easy to find. The replacement band was about 40 bucks and had to be ordered through Chase Durer. Then the battery started going dead...also no problem I thought but Chase D says that you can't replace it yourself it must be done through them - that would have been another 50 bucks...but I did it myself anyway and somehow the dials got a bit off-centered and figured that it probably cost even more cash to get that fixed. So all in all I spent 250 on the watch and found that maintaining the watch for my lifetime would probably triple the money already spent - no thanks. Great watch but high maintenence."
2,"Good recipes, lame advice",I got a few great recipes from this book but other than that I found the advice to be unhelpful and lame. I don't recommend this book.
2,Basically just a reprint of the 5 version,Ben is a great teacher and definitely has a way of explaining things so that you can easily grasp the concept but I will be returning my copy of this book for a refund. It is pretty much identical (images and text) to the older 5 version. There has been some new information added in the area of web graphics but most of the new stuff that deals with the upgrades in PS 6.0 can be found online. If you already own Adobe Photoshop 5 Studio Techniques then there is no need to buy this book.If I was buying this book for the first time then I would agree with the other reviewers and give it a high rating so take this review with a grain of salt.
2,Gould? Where?,"I must admit I dislike calling this work a real performance since it is not more than a series of MIDI sequences (there are many other sequences - and better - in the world!).Interpretation of the great ""Art of the Fugue"" here is sometimes poetic; the sound is nice, not excellent, and often the Author falls into something ridicolous, such as too much staccato at the end of Contrapuncto I after a lot of well balanced phrasings; or when he marks each theme with a lot of flourishes which have no sense in piano music, above all in the Disklavier music, etc.But the biggest mistake is to compare these ""performances"" with the Glenn Gould ones (see from the web). Also these are too metrical, too sequenced, too false. Sorry; and Gould was not a machine as the Author thinks."
4,What a breakthrough,"Here is likely the best Disklavier recording ever produced. The time put into this project must have been staggering. I heartily recommend that the listener have a good meal, a good glass of red wine and a long listening session with this disc -- during which all cares and time are abandoned. Buy this."
2,Buy mischief instead!!!,"Half of this movie is found on mischief. Too much girls, and little exciting cars.Best part on this DVD is the bonus feature."
2,strange move,"The entire idea of this movie is absurd but the only good thing is the two stars and the nudity witin this movie. Otherwise, forget it. There are other movies better written and acted."
2,girls and thats it,"This movie was nothing but a waste of money. sure girls are nice but not when it more than half of a movie. Nothing exciting or fun happened. Bought Mischief 3000 with this dvd and was much more satisfied with that movie. dont buy unless you feel like seeing girls, not cars."
2,But Mischief instead!,"Half of this movie is found on mischief. Too much girls, and little exciting cars.Best part on this DVD is the bonus feature."
1,Poor construction,"Problems :* does not grind coffee very fine and leaves many whole beans* very limited volume for beans* top is not secure, and can fall off easily (mostly an issue for when taking it in and out of the cabinet)* broke after 4 months of 'weekend-only' use (the blade just fell off)"
1,Terrible,"After three months of grinding only once a day (one cup worth of beans), it fell apart. My experience was similar to that of a previous reviewer, the arm with the blades fell off the axle and was therefore useless. I understand an occasional defect, but the worst part was Bodum's customer service. They very rudely informed me that they weren't interested in hearing from me unless I had a receipt. I asked, ""Are you telling me that most people actually save their receipts when they buy a coffee grinder?"", to which they curtly replied, ""Yes, everybody else does"". I can't believe that this is true, and I think they should stand behind their product a little better than this."
4,Best of the Small Whirlys,"This is a very nice and efficient small whirling blade grinder. I have had one for several years and like it much better than the other popular models (Krups etc.) that I've owned previously. It is an outstanding value.As usual some of the reviews here make no sense. I recommend you take them with a load of salt.It grinds plenty fast so grind only what you need and more importantly, a reasonable amount at a time and you won't have problems getting the grind size you want. I find the sound much less annoying than others I've owned/used.peacebb"
2,Get a Burr Type Grinder Instead,"It is awkward to take off the top, add beans, grind and remove the grounds. It is also difficult to consistently get a reliable grind. After about a year of use the button stopped working so it had to be turned on and off by unplugging it. Overall the design of this type of coffee grinder is not ideal. I would suggest that regular coffee drinkers get a burr type grinder with a hopper and grind storage box."
2,Terrible grinder,"It works, but barely. Doesn't grind well. Has an unusually short cord that requires unplugging to empty every time. I am going to replace this with a Krups which I've owned in the past and always worked well."
2,Grinder lid arrived broken,"The grinder itself is fine but the plastic lid was crumbling when I took it out of the box, which unfortunately was after the return period expired. So there are chips of plastic missing along the bottom of the lid. You'd think a company would want to look at such a thing to improve their product. I'd opt for a grinder with rave reviews."
2,Bad choice,"So, got this one at whole foods.I was in a hurry to make me a coffee I guess.The button is now permanently stuck on ""on"". So I just unplug it.The grinding is not fine enough for me and there is no setting to change this.So , just don't buy it.have a good day.Saar"
1,Broken within 6 months,"I used to have the now discontinued aluminum Bodum grinder; a beautifully designed, well-built and sturdy product that withstood several years of daily use. This model, while similar in looks, is lightweight and poorly constructed - with the motor breaking after just a few months. I suggest avoiding it."
2,Poorly Functioning Grinder,"I've owned this grinder for more than 2 years. I found myself use it less and less. The reasons being: 1]. It doesn't grind beans in a consistent fashion. The top beans are coarsely grinded and the bottom beans are Turkey-Coffee-Fine grinded. No matter how hard you shake during the grinding process, it doesn't help. Coffee still comes out that way. 2]. You cannot grind many at a time. Putting too many beans in the grinder will only worsen the outcome. 3]. As previous posters said, it is very difficult and messy to 'pour' out the coffee (if you can call it pour). I use brush, spoon, folks, chopsticks, and everything in between to take the coffee out. But there is ALWAYS something left behind. 4]. The machine cannot take grinning time continuously anything longer than 20 minutes. If you work it this hard, it simply stops work. You have to wait for 10 minutes to have it work again.Rethink about buying this grinder!"
2,just no good,"Machine looks cool, but does not grind the coffe finely enough! And, getting the coffe out of it (with that silly shallow lid) is a trick you don't want to try before your first cup of coffe in the morning."
2,Cracked case,"Had this grinder for 8 months. Two large cracks have formed in the side of the unit, now they are widening and trapping lots of coffee grounds. I'm tossing it and getting a different brand. All form, no function."
2,Cracked lid out of the box,"Unfortunately I didn't open the box after having this grinder for a year. Half of the lid was shattered in the box, which makes the on/off switch not function. Great - I was eagerly awaiting my morning coffee and now not only did I lose my investment in this grinder but I have to go buy coffee."
2,A poorly designed coffee grinder,"This coffee grinder is very inconvenient to use--getting the ground coffee out of the machine is difficult and messy. Removing the coffee requires a tiny spoon or a brush, and even then is incomplete, leaving dregs in the grinder to turn rancid and spoil the flavor of future coffee, and a mess on the counter. I've used several less expensive models that were lots less trouble. Also, the body of the grinder is too fat to pick up securely with one hand, creating a tendency to drop it and make an even bigger mess. It looks like very little thought went into this design."
2,"Nice design, poor materials.","I purchased this coffee grinder in July of 2003. I love the design and the color matches our other teal accented kitchen items perfectly. It does a decent job of ginding coffee, but after only 5 months, of once a day use, it started to develop vertical stress cracks in the plastic casing around the top. As of right now (January 2004), more cracks have developed and the initial cracks have become even longer (going down below the interior stainless steel ""bowl""). Because of all the cracks, the lid now fits very loosely, and I'm afraid that with more use, the cracks will continue to extend downward, rendering the entire unit unusable. The stainless steel cased version may be the way to go, but since we don't have any stainless steel accessories in our kitchen, I will be replacing my grinder with another brand."
1,"Flimsy, Fell Apart on me (twice!)","We bought this grinder for our office, and used it for about 2 months, grinding at most 2-3 times a day on weekdays, and then the part that holds the blade onto the center axle cracked and fell off, leaving the axle spinning uselessly while the blade didnt move. We assumed it was a one-time fluke since Bodum is normally an excellent company, and purchased the same model again. Guess what? The second one lasted maybe 3 months, and then the SAME problem occurred, with the main attachment for the blade just falling apart and eventually flying off and leaving us with another useless hunk of plastic and metal. We purchased both grinders at Whole Foods, I dont know if they distribute a different version of the same model or what but its really a poor excuse for a grinder, especially considering that Bodum is a company that specializes in all things Coffee and Tea.On the plus side, it did grind the coffee nicely...while it worked."
2,Poorly designed coffee grinder,"This coffee grinder is very inconvenient to use--getting the ground coffee out of the machine is difficult and messy.

I've used several less expensive models that were lots less trouble. Also, the body of the grinder is too fat to pick up securely with one hand, creating a tendency to drop it and make an even bigger mess. It looks like very little thought went into this design."
2,If you want your coffee ground fine then keep looking,"I bought this grinder after seeing it recommended on another site. Unfortunately, I quickly discovered that this grinder does not do a good job of fine grinding. Also, the lid is a little finicky going on and can't be used to hold the ground coffee. If you need your coffee ground fine, and don't want to shell out the bucks for a burr grinder, try the Braun KSM2."
2,Using Bodum Mill Blade Grinder,"I selected this item as an incentive for subscribing to a coffee service. I find that I am using much more coffee now than when I was using ground coffee from the store. The coffee must be stirred in order to get a uniform grind, otherwise, the coffee in the bottom of the grinder is extremely fine and the coffee on the top is rather coarse.Nainie"
2,Broken,The blade broke off this unit after less than two years of light use. Inspection of the flimsy plastic that attaches the blade to the motor shaft reveal that breakage is basically inevitable. This is a very poor design.
2,New Age mixed with Catholic Romanticism,"Thomas does deserve credit for helping to re-cover a sense of earth consciousness. However, in most of his books, and especially this one, he brings in elements of his personal appreciation for a religion (Catholicism) and its veneration of idols combining them with a kind of eco-spiritualism.Perhaps Berry's best accomplishment is in inspiring newer writers like Brian Swimme who's works stand above most other Gaian-type writers."
1,New Age Religion in the Guise of Christianity,"Don't be misled. Because Thomas Berry is promoted as a Catholic priest, many people are falsely led to believe that his books present Catholic or Christian teaching about the environment. Instead, this book presents a New Age blend of do-it-yourself religion mixed with pseudo-science. If you're into that, you'll probably like this book..."
4,Excellent collection of essays,"Thomas Berry's ""The Dream of the Earth"" is a hard-hitting collection of essays designed to snap us out of our human-centred arrogance with regards to the Earth and the entire universe.As a series of essays, it is of necessity disjointed and hence only a 4 star review but still recommended.Get ""The Universe Story"" co-authored with Brian Swimme for the 5-star stuff!"
3,Puzzle did not arrive in good condition,"The puzzles themselves had nice big pieces and knobs. The shelf storage part was broken and the paint seemed to be chipping. I had to send it back. It arrived with the wrapping all torn. In the future, consideration should be given to packaging and shipping."
2,Out of Control,"I purchased this game because I like rally games and it was cheap. You get what you pay for. Having owned serveral rally games for the PS2 and Xbox, I have never played a game with such loose controls. It was very frustrating having to fish tail through much of the races. The game does not seem very deep as there are not that many tracks and very little as far as customization of your vehicles. But if you can handle the controls, there can be some fun in the game. It is a PS3 game so there are some nice graphics to be had(especially the track surfaces). The tracks were fine, but being on the more arcade side, they should have made the tracks a little more crazy with big jumps. I was fighting the controls the whole time while finishing 6th(last)most of the time. I could not enjoy this game and will sell it to get credit to purchase Dirt and/or Pure as the reviews for those have been good and hopefully the controls are tighter, which I like."
4,Rally Revo,It is kind of like playing Dirt except that the track is muddier and harder to control your vehicle.
1,"Nice cars, nice graphics, horrible game.","This game is unplayable. Whether on dirt or pavement, your car will oversteer, even 4wd rally cars which should be understeering. There's no sense of speed as well. Unless you look at the speedo, there's no sense of whether you're going 20mph or 120."
2,Not Real good,"I was very disapointed with this game. Having played the arcade version I was expecting more. Racing sims have come a long way in quality and gameplay i.e., Formula 1 2008. This game was left behind. I would pay no more than $10.00."
3,Old school control,I was hoping this title would support accuratly the tilt controler. No it doesn't. Big null zone then to quick. Turning in for $10 credit at store.
2,A bestseller of 1909,"Truxton King is a young American. Not just any American, but strong, tall, brave, individual, and rich. The only kind of American McCutcheon likes to write about. Truxton is traveling about the world in search of adventure and romance and finds both in the little fictional country of Graustark. It's up to Truxton to protect the child-prince from the evil Communists who plot to kill him with a suicide bomber (yes, they had suicide bombers even back then) and take over the principality."
2,read THE PRISONER OF ZENDA instead,"In order to ""get"" this book, it helps if you understand that Anthony Hope's classic adventure THE PRISONER OF ZENDA (a swashbuckling romance set in a mythical, but supposedly ""realistic"" country -- it's really a kind of fantasy, but a brilliant book in all respects) spawned a host of imitators, the most famous of which was George Barr McCutcheon's GRAUSTARK, a big bestseller of it's day. (There was a real trend in the beginning of the twentieth century of writers trying to self-consciously ""bring back romance"".)This is a book in the Graustark series. Again, it's romantic adventure in an imaginary, but supposedly ""actual"" country. (I always imagine these places as being somewhere near Latvia or Lithuania.) It's readable, but suffers in comparison with the Hope classic -- it tends to go on and on much more than Hope's, for instance, the setup is nowhere near as clever as ZENDA, nor is the plot as tight.A curiousity, no more."
4,Good Stuff,"This stuff works! Removes stains and smells, so far all pet related in my house, but some of them had been on the carpet for months, and this stuff took them out. I did have to go over some of the tough ones a couple times, so I don't think this is gonna last too long. The reason for the four, as opposed to five, star review was the weird packaging method. It seems like it would have been easier to send one large bottle instead of three small ones, but then maybe it would have made pouring difficult. Anyway, it's good stuff, it works!"
4,Bissell Little Green Formula,A good cleaning agent for use - no harsh fumes and it get the job done. A larger bottle would be nice.
4,"For your SpotBot and other ""Compact"" steam cleaners.","Little Green does a great job as an all-purpose cleaner. It is a low-foam solution meant for use in small machines such as the SpotBot. It does a good job of cutting through soil and lifts stains quickly and efficiently. The perfume in this solution is light and crisp and is not over powering. If you have pets, want to tackle upholstered furniture or have some really challenging spots you may want to explore some of the other solutions offered on the market. (Bissel offers a pet solution that also has built-in Scotchgard that is an extremely effective product.)"
4,good stuff,This cleaned our furniture real good with no discloaring.Our grandchildren love to eat chips and watch tv.
5,Great stuff!!!,"I am very pleased with this cleaner. It took mystery stains out of my cream colored carpet that I have tried to get out before. It didn't take out everything, but now I'll be able to put off buying new carpet for awhile longer. It smells nice too :)"
1,This product will not be sent as a 3-pack!,"I have tried two different times to order this as a 3-pack and both times only received ONE BOTTLE. It should not be that hard to include the other two bottles. I have gotten a refund both times, so if you need this product...buy it somewhere else. Someone in shipping does not know what a 3-pack is suppose to look like."
5,also excellent for students of English as a second language,"The book is written in a simple pattern:1. the refrain ""Pocket, pocket, what's in my pocket?2. ""Something that's [adjective].""3. [noun]Students of English as a second language can easily follow this."
5,Ambiguities of reform,"This well-done account of the rise of the Progressive Movement is as good on the history of the period, and is studded with many interesting details about the Victorian period in the gestation of the great challenge to the world of big business. Notable, and what makes the book out of the ordinary, is depiction of the limits of the movement seen in the account of the movement's attitudes toward segregation. This was also the era of consolidated Jim Crow, where were the Reformer? The book is food for thought indeed given the strange similarity to our own era of politics, or lack of it."
2,The Death of Art,"I read a lot of art-related books for book club. I had hopes that this would be a good choice, but I was so wrong. Glad I didn't prematurely recommend it. I just could not get into it. I didn't care for the plot line, the characters, nor the style of writing. It was one of a very few books that I just quit reading.On the positive side, it was shipped promptly and arrived in perfect condition."
3,Patricia MacLachlan's Seven Kisses in a Row Makes a Sweet Children's Book,"Emma, who's 8 years old, has woken up almost every morning of her life to 7 kisses in a row from each of her parents. But her father is an `eye doctor' and had to attend an `eye doctor conference', bringing her mother along. With their parents gone Emma and her brother are being taken care of by their Aunt Evelyn and Uncle Elliot. In this cute, 7 chapter story, Emma and Zachary have 5 days to teach their Aunt and Uncle how to be good parents. I would give this book 3 stars, and recommend it to any 7, 8, or 9 year old."
4,bah humbug,like the outfit. different look. only problem is cap is tight. good value for the money. quick shipping. wore to Santa pub crawl. looked good.
2,get what you pay for...,"i defiantly got what i paid for (& it was not much). The belt i received is big enough to rap around 3 of me and i'm not that small of a guy. shipping was quick, but don't plan on wearing this suite more then once our twice.."
1,Pocket Money,"This product has a great format on the Palm, however as one who is not a wiz on the computor I gave up after spending about 6 hours trying to get it to interface with my Quicken. Might be a great product for those who are very computor literate but if your of the load and use nature, stay away. Also when I went to the Pocket Money support group I got a whole lot of instructions that may or may not have been in English for all the good they did."
1,One of Mann's best films: one of the very worst DVDs ever,"Reign of Terror, or The Black Book, is one of the great Anthony Mann's very best pictures - a nightmarish tale of the French Revolution shot in the style of a film noir expressionistic nightmare with superlative production design from William Cameron Menzies. But I'm loathe to say any more that might encourage you to buy this disc simply because this is without doubt the very worst DVD I have ever seen - the poor contrast and appalling definition ruining John Alton's brilliant cinematography, while the variable transfer speed makes slurs of many of the witticisms. This is a neglected masterpiece crying out for the kind of treatment that MPI have given the Sherlock Holmes films, but whatever you do, don't make the mistake of thinking this terrible transfer from Alpha/Gotham is worth the low price - it isn't, and that's a real crime against cinema."
2,"Great movie, VERY bad DVD","This movie is a gem, but to view it in these poor conditions (the frame is off-center, the blacks are light grey and the pictures fuzzy) is really an offense to the original material. Don't be fooled by the low price. Even if it was free I would still hesitate."
2,Poor edition,"This edition of an Anthony Mann film has been crudely transferred, and is actually worse than another release of the same movie still around.It requires muchvideo adjustment to get it to a comfortable image. It is a shame for it has many first class features:(1) A script, reasonably faithful to actual history, but obviously cut to come out as a basic thriller,(2) a splendid cast, with the exception of Cummings, who however does not spoil the drama,(3)Arlene Dahl, one of the great beauties, who did not havetoo much luck with her assignments.Maybe some day some one will produce a restoredfaithful print."
3,Great Story Which Should Be Viewed,"Many of the existing reviews critical of the DVD transfer areso negative that one doesn't want to view this material.Yetthe story is great and the acting good. It is a work of historicalfiction about the French Revolution-comparable in many ways toA Tale of Two Cities (ignoring the transfer problems).If you likethis period,you should view this DVD.The transfer improves a bitas you get into the body of the work. I did find the cover art(picture of Arlene Dahl) a bit disappointing."
1,Very inferior product,"Essentially a fake DVD, apparently ripped from a VHS recording from a television broadcast and missing about twenty percent of its running time. Very disappointing, since the film is a fascinating specimen of the work of the director Anthony Mann and the great film noir cinematographer John Alton."
1,What bozzo edited this film?,I saw this film on AMC and thourghly enjoyed it. I was shocked when I saw this DVD. Who was the inept clown who edited out many of the most important sequences and made the DVD version so patchy as to be almost unwatchable? The film was not that long and did not need to be edited. If you only watched this DVD you would be hard pressed to discern a cohesive story line. I will not purchase anything more from this distributor as they should be ashamed of themselves.
1,Terrible transfer,"Can't I give it a zero-stars rating? Shucks! Well, Alpha Video transfers tend to be inferior, but this surpasses their usual race to the bottom. about 20% of the picture is missing on the left side, which is odd considering that fitting it to the TV format meant only trimming it from 1.37 to 1.33. So what they've done is taken some off either the top or bottom as well as the left side. Titles and credits are offset to one side, and not by just a smidgen. The video quality is totally sub-par; obviously, they haven't made the least effort at restoring the film. Finally, the audio is barely comprehensible in some parts, and poor in the least-worst parts. I didn't even bother finishing the movie. It's going directly in the trash.Based on my previous experiences, my recommendation to everyone is to avoid an Alpha Video transfer. Unfortunately I did not notice they were the publisher. Equally unfortunately, theirs is the only copy that's been published."
2,Bad Transfer,"I didn't realize that there was a better, but still bad transfer of this, that also has more of the film. This version is very blurry. You can tell that it is a gorgeous film, so Mann fans should see even a poor version. The secondary actors are well cast. Arlene Dahl is beautiful, if not much else. Robert Cummings isn't all that good, but he doesn't overact dreadfully, as I've seen him do in other movies, so I sort of liked him in this. While not all that accurate, the film does deal with some of the factual happenings of the revolution and has a great air of menace."
1,A Very Cheap Rip-Off,"Although this is a truly great classic film-noir period piece with some fine acting and suspensful script, the quality of the DVD (I would hate to see the copy in VHS) is almost too painful to watch. The backgrounds are all too dark to recognize, any details of footage is lost in the poor transfer quality, it's an all-around a terrible disappointment. I would recommend not purchasing any DVDs from this company despite the very inexpensive price. If you want to throw your money away, donate it to some worthwhile organization----do not buy this DVD!"
2,painful... even by undergraduate math textbook standards,"I remember this ghastly nightmare from my undergraduate days. It was the only math textbook that I really struggled with. Part of that was probably due to having an inordinately lousy professor, but part of it is because the book reads more like a quick review for people who already know the subject matter than as an actual tool for learning.As a contrast, check out what people are saying about ""A Book of Abstract Algebra"" by Pinter -- they're right, THAT is everything a math textbook should be. My class never quite finished it, but I had no trouble reading the later chapters on my own. I still have a copy of Chung's book, but it only has one remotely interesting thing in it that I remember, which was Laplace's calculation of the probability that the sun will rise tomorrow.Bottom line: if you're unfortunate enough to end up with a professor who is still using Chung's book (I used it in 1997) ... run!"
3,"good coffee, faulty on-off switch","The first time I used the machine I was very impressed - fun to watch and good coffee. The clean up is not so bad, as others have said, that is until you leave the pot on the heating element assuming that it will shut off like it is supposed to. Then when you get out of the shower you find finely brewed coffee sprayed on the wall behind the machine (Apparently it had switched on --??-- and reboiled with no top part to recieve the boiling water). The quick (and obvious) fix is to just unplug it after you get done. It's not a big deal but it is a bit of a hassle. The coffee may not be bitter but I am still left with a bitter taste in my mouth."
5,Even better than the real thing,"I bought this after having owned (and broken entirely through my own clumsiness) two traditional glass stove-top Santoses (Santi? Santa? Santes?)I was very glad, for the sake of my nerves, that this machine is made from extremely durable polycarbonate. The water in Paris is very hard, so it remains to be seen how badly it scales up, and how effective descaling treatments will be.It was a bit expensive, but the simple fact is that the vacuum method makes the best coffee you can realistically make at home.The electric Santos is easy to use, fast and makes fabulous coffee. It's a little harder to clean than a regular drip machine would be, but then the coffee tastes so much better that it's worth it."
3,wish the booklet was much bigger.,I am giving this as a Christmas gift to my grandmother who has hard time reading small print and write small. I have to get something else for her. its nice but to small booklet and all
3,"Looks cheaply done, not a good keepsake item","I bought another one that was more of a keepsake photo album and book (also from Amazon.com).This is more of a day-to-day calendar idea. It is small and spiral bound. Good for working grandma's to use as a desk calendar or to start their morning.But for a longterm keepsake, I would not recommend it."
2,I do not like the size of these books they are tiny,I do not like the size or design of these books. They are extremely small and are not made of a material that will stand up to years of wear and tear.
3,Spiral bound bad idea,Th e questions are sweet and the layout nice but the spiral bound is a big problem... the picture doesn't show spiral bound but when it arrived i was very dissapointed. i wanted something that could be a keep sake but i am worried it will be ruined by the time they have finished writting in it. I am looking for a local company to re-bind it. hard cover would have been much better
3,Not what I expected; Pay attention to product details,"This memory book is much smaller than I was anticipating. I was disappointed, but it's my fault for failing to read the entire product details. This book is about the size of an index card and is spiral bound. The photo of the item gives the impression that the book is leather-bound. Although the book was created as a gift for grandparents, the size of the text is too small for senior citizens to read comfortably. Additionally, they did not allow enouh space for grandparents to write detailed memories. Some of the questions are redundant; they repeat some questions but rephrase them a little diffrently. I still think my grandparents will appreciate the journal, but I really wish I would have chosen a diffrent, larger memory book."
5,Absolutely wonderful gift for grandmother!,"This is a wonderful gift to give a new or current grandmother, or even as a gift to a grandchild (after adding to it of course). Basically, this book contains many questions and pages for Grandma to answer and pass down to her grandkids. It's something the grandkids can read whenever and get a great understanding of the person their grandmother is. It might seem a little morbid at first, but having something written down is a great suppliment to all the great times the child will have with his grandmother. Please note, however, that in order to get hundreds of memories into one small spiral bound paperback book, it is not as substantial and sturdy as some of the other memory books. Though I think it is a good trade-off."
1,NOT a 4/4 size violin case,"I will have to send this back. It didn't say the size in the ad, so one would think that it would be 4/4 size. Apparently not."
1,Not for full size violins,"I just received this item. It seems like a decent case, but nowhere on this site does it mention violin size so I assumed it was for an adult 4/4 violin. It is too small for a full size violin. I will be sending it back immediately."
5,This Book is one of Mas Oyama's greatest works!! Buy it!!,Mas Oyama has written many books based on years of training and applied theory of Karate. He taught Kyukushin and this is the karateka's Bible!! I recommend this all martial artist and interested reader's!!
1,Disapointed.,"As a fan or Aeon Flux & Alexander the Great, this was doubly disapointing, very very very loose adaptation of the legend of Alexandros Phillipos Makedonan.He too far too many liberties with Alexanders relationships & leaves ALL of this stuff out:*Alexander had had 3 mistress: Campaspe, Barsine, & Roxana.*He never actually married Roxana.*His main draw to Roxana was that she reminded him of his dead mother.*Her name is pronounced Rozana & not Roksana.*Alexander's name is pronounced Ahlezandros, & everyone knows he was blonde.*He was noted for not having much of a libido & regularly turned down women that were offered to him.*He & Hephaestion were life partners, lovers. The way he reacts to Hephaestion's death in this series is unacceptable.*He also kept a male love slave named Bagoas.*King Phillipos & his wife had a rocky unloving relationship. He wasted no time getting a 2ed wife when she died, & he was killed by his a male lover."
3,"My response - ""eh. its ok""","I fell in love with Aeon Flux (a series that Peter Chung (character designer) had previously worked on). I thoguht Reign would be just as good as or better than Aeon, but I was wrong.Reign is a nice series. Great animation and character designs(^_^ Peter Chung) but the story and plot are not that great. :\I would give it a 3 out of 5 stars. I think its more like a 2.5 stars though. :\"
5,"The Amazing, Imaginative Brain of Jon Rosen","This little book, with it's wildly quirky and hysterically funny characters (and drawings) is amusing over and over again. Giving it as a gift to someone you know well and really like becomes sort of a private joke between you - rather like including them in the inner circle of those who ""get it"" and are proud to be one of life's misfits!"
5,Looking for small slip joint pliers? Try these.,"If you're a tool junkie, you probably won't have a lot of use for slip joint pliers, but they're one of those tools that's handy to have around for little jobs. These are built to great standards with comfy plastic grips. They feel like they'll stand up to a fair amount of use and abuse."
5,good book,As a Chemical Engineering student this book has everything that you need and assumes you have the background to take the class.
1,Unusable,"I tried to learn Physical Chemistry from this book. Our professor was required to add it to the syllabus, even though he never assigned anything from it and had to resort to using his own printed notes. The book is verbose, yet teaches very little. Important points are never highlighted. It is almost as if the writer of this book has a seething hatred for first year p-chem students. IF your professor will be teaching out of a note packet, you can feel free NOT to buy this book, as you will find it completely useless."
2,Yick!,"I guess if you already know what you're doing, this book might be a good reference. But as a text for intro p-chem students...ugh! Please, can we have some more explanations instead of jumping from place to place without doing the math in between that really confuses those of us who've never had it before? I know that's what the mathchapters are supposed to be for, but this book still makes too many assumptions - that one doesn't need to be told the intermediate steps used to get from one place to another."
1,Terrible Physical Chemistry Book,"I had the unfortunate experience of having to use this book. It's poorly formatted which leaves the reader at a disadvantage before even trying to study from it. Equations are derived for pages, however, the actual easily usable form of the equation is never hightlighted or boxed to direct your attention to the most important equation. The chapters on quantum chemistry and laughable. Poor job handling theories and background to various ideas. Bad diagrams (black and white), poor unit notation, and terrible sentence structure. I feel like I'm reading something from the Enlightenment era where every sentence is three times longer than necessary. Don't buy this book unless you have no other options."
5,Amazing P-Chem book,"McQuarrie has done a superb job in writing books. This books present every single topic in a student-approachable concept. Mathematical concepts were also explained in specific chapters; so, students won't get lost with the mathematics. Presentations are so clear that this book can be used for self-study. My P-Chem class used Atkins' textbook and I didn't learn anything from that textbook. This is a much much better textbook. However, if you are a grad student, you might want to also purchase Levine's Quantum Chemistry."
5,Excellent graduate level introduction,"Fifty years after taking Quantum mechanics in Physics, I wanted an up to date review of what has happened in my lifetime at a high technical level. Mathematically they do not go all the way into the method Froebenius to solve the various Sturm-Liouville equations, but then it is not a course in special functions, but rather their applications to P Chem. I found it especially fascinating that the molecular bonding is a purely quantum mechanical effect involving the exchange integrals of the wave functions. Good read with lots of material. Maybe I can at last understand group theory or at least what it's good for. Solid pedagogical approach, often showing how simplistic examples lead to a subtle understanding. Excellent book. I like the biographical sketches of the famous chemists. Every section title is a full sentence."
3,ok,It was written in a lot. This made studying a little bit hardier than I expected. When it said like new I didn't think it would have ripped pages and writing in it.
5,Teaching Thinking and Problem Solving in Math,"I had recently purchased this book to help my niece who was working with her young daughter on problem solving skills.This book does an excellent job of explaining how to teach problem solving skills as well as thinking skills. The author gives clear, easy to understand explanations on each part of the problem solving model. She also gives a detailed explanation of a problem solving model that she had created for her own students.I remembered using this book while I was teaching my fifth graders. I found the book to be helpful and the ideas easy to implement. I hardily recommend this book for both teachers and parents.owner of The Learning Expressway"
1,terrible pen,"This is a cheaply made pen that performs poorly. In fact, it clogs up so easily you will spend more time cleaning it than you will writing with it."
1,Here's the proper credit for Doom,"Pathetic. Almost as bad as Bloodrayne. It would seem Andrzej Bartkowiak knew nothing of the game. Altough I did not go into this expecting it to be ""spot on"" with the story-line of the game, they could have at least tried to make the attempt. The creators of Doom the game deserved better than this movie."
2,ok,"it was just ok, i mean it was kindof like one of those movies were u can make in your own garage. the special effects were ok, and the plot, wait there is no plot in this movie. its confusing and pretty lame at times like the jump at you scenes. after you watch about 5 minutes of it, you will think why did i even spend my own money on such a movie that i dont understand anything thats happening."
2,My first review was too harsh (2.5 stars),"When I first wrote a review for this movie I will confess that I was angry that it did not have any demons or evil monsters from hell, but upon further review I must take back my previous opinion, and say that though Doom the movie does not carry the spirit of doom into it it is still a pretty good movie. I believe that if the movie had been more original then I would have liked it (except for the first person part of the movie wich is why the rating is not higher aside from not being original). Overall as much as I hate to admit it this is a pretty good movie and worth watching (yes this is leaving a bad taste in my mouth) so go ahead and watch it it is by no standard the best video game based movie ever but decent overall.SORRY ABOUT MY FIRST REVIEW."
2,Meh,I'm willing to give any scifi a chance and thought this might at least take me back to Doom playing years. But don't bother unless you have nothing better to watch.
2,IQ reducer,"I don't think there should have been a Doom movie. In the old days Doom was a great game you could play for hours. As the game itself only consisted of shooting aliens it was virtually impossible for anyone to write a decent script for this movie. Obviously The Rock's acting abilities are at the right place here. Still the movie didn't turn out that bad after all. A few actors, like Karl Urban for example, still make it worthwile to keep watching. Of course they usually talk scientific nonsense all the time, but it was fun to see some people take Doom seriously, although it's an absolute IQ reducer. (SARR)"
3,"Doom, Plot succombs to every cliche in the book","I am a big sci fi fan and a fan of Dwayne ""the Rock"" Johnson. Consequently, I enjoyed the movie. However, serious movie fans should probably pass this one by. As a movie, it uses every plot cliche you could imagine. The story is contrived and childish, however, there is probably way too much violence to let your kids watch the movie."
3,Can Doom Be Doomed?,"I admit that while watching this . . . I thought that it was going to suck. I was only half right. To put it bluntly, this movie is vast and it does have a lot of style, monsters, and characters but in the end it lacks something more. To put it more simply. I'll let you weigh the pors and cons so that you can decide whether you wanna buy it or not. I bought it right away without even thinking.Pros:-Original storyline-Cool gadjets-Cool Guns-Cool special effects-Well-built sets-Cool first person perspective scene.-Good scar tactics.-feels like a videogame.Cons:-sometimes the characters do nothing but search.-Too much walking around in the dark.-The suspense, at times, gets boring.-And finally, the rock cannot act. How are you going to wear the same expression saying each and every line. It's almost like there is no emphases on any word. It really gets repeatative."
3,Once Again ---- Entertainment,"Could have done with out the nude doll [wether she be alive or dead] and still can't tumble to the vulgar language [a guy thing? must be they can't articulate themselves].Enjoyed the plot [game?? never saw it] great acting by Urban, the Rock and the rest - I can take the blood and guts - thoroughly enjoyed the features with the make of the monsters and Rock's make-up explanation - and their training in weapons.Have great admiration for any man in the Special Forces and their abilities.Never did figure out #24 - it's use - super people??Did so enjoy the plot - the pace - the inhumans [or whatever] - the dark side of it all.All right for most? adults? sure not even a teenage movie."
1,Dark...Boring...Sleep-Fest...,"This movie starts off like it may have some potential. The first hour or so has some suspenseful moments and some interesting character development. It takes what seems to be an hour to get the movie going action-wise...and when it does it is disappointing. When monsters are attacking in the dark they are hard to see. The ending was stupid when it tried to copy the Doom video game ""eye-view"". It reminded me of how god-awful ""House Of The Dead"" was."
3,Mindless Fun,"If your looking for a film that has an eloquent script or some subtle meaning then this film isn't for you.However if you want to sit back, without having to engage your brain, and just watch action packed gore fest then get this movie.If you watch this film without any preconceived expectations of what it should be (come on it's a film based on a computer game starring The Rock it's never gonna be Citizen Kane) then you should find it very entertaining."
1,Complete and total crap,"An embarrassment to the video game and all of the fans. I can't believe ID Software actually let them use the title ""Doom"" on this garbage. Read ""Knee-Deep In The Dead"" and ""Hell On Earth"" for what the movie SHOULD have been. It was like the screenplay was written by someone who played the video game 10 years ago and made up the story from what they remember. There are NO monsters from the game, NO Hell and NO Flynn Taggart. Don't waste your time. Hollywood ruined ANOTHER story that had great potential, and they turned it into a piece of marketed, unoriginal crap."
1,Doom The Movie,This Was A Particulary Poor Film And Only The First Person Scenes Lifted It Above Going To The Dentist As Painful Experiences I Hope John Cormack Had Nothing To Do With This Cash In Tripe Steer Clear Not Even Worth Cult Status Like Films Such As Dog Soldiers Et Al
1,did they even play the game???,"how could they make this so bad they had the right actors the sets were ok but what the hell was with the plot 24 chromosomes what??? its about the portal to hell opening which is way cooler then this lame story line, i just wanted dumb big action what the #@$%@ was with the fight at the end nothing to do with doom two soldiers fighting last time i checked doom was about killing demons, damn this sucks not even worth a rental no cool monsters except for maybe one, most of them looked lame(especially the zomies just poeople in pj's with tomato sauce on their face) i hope the poeple involved with this never get to ruin another franchise. It was just so so so boring where was the plasma gun??? im shocked this was even released suck suck suck dont rent it play the game instead."
2,big dissapointment,ok first off there has never been a good movie that is based on a video game.NONE! But i expected a game as liked and respected as DOOM you would think that they would put a lot more effort into it.. The acting was horrible...the monsters were ok but i thought there would be a lot more of them and the story was offline with the game. So in my opinion this is a bad movie. It has gotten my worst review yet. So if you like the game dont watch this movie.
1,PLEASE ROCK DON'T MAKE A SEQUEL!!!,"Wow, where should i start, and i don't mean that in a good way!The story line is not like the game, not to say it has to be. but it seems like it was like the story line but all the details that made the game story awesome were left out. For instance, the fact that there are monsters everywhere but they are just genetic mutations of the research facilities staff not monsters from HELL. And sarge?? a bad guy?? Killing the ""kid"" thats messed up.this movie is pretty much a rip of of Aliens if you think about it. glad i only rented this movie. Lets talk about the Pro and CONSPROS- uh...only 113mins!!CONS- characters suckstory suckssarge sucksweapons suckthat dude in the wheel chair sucksending sucksthe first person sequence suckseffects suckacting sucks"
1,What the @$%@# !,"Where was the game? The only thing that came close to any of the Doom games in this movie were 3 types of monsters. Unfotunatly they were geneticly constructed. The origins of Doom that I grew up with and loved was not made or came from man but HELL, were the Hell was HELL in this movie. The graphic affects were moderate at best, and that 1st person shooter view I don't think I have ever been sea sick on land befor but I was then! This movie was not by any meens a good representation of the games. Needed more of the original monsters, and the original story line, not some half cocked idea just to throw a movie out there with a video games name!"
2,WHAT A PIECE OF %&#$,"I have grow up with doom 1 & 2 in super nintendo and i have very good memory of them,so what i expected was the ""movie version"" of these games,of course doom 3 too,but not..it's a really shame because these games was the background of games like resident evil,silent hill,halo,etc and the game deserved a better movie..so whats the problem?...what happen to the flying one eye monster,the minotour,the mechanicspider,the blooding monsters and all the gore and suspense of the games?...i don't know but i think fans deserved a better movie........"
2,Mediocre at best...,"Remember the game? Remember the premise? You were a marine battling demons from Hell who infiltrated a military facility. What a brilliant and original idea!So what did the makers of the film do? They put aside that idea and changed the enemy from demons to genetic mutations. Great, except THAT idea has already been done, what, a million times??? Resident Evil anyone? So, what you'll NOT see from the game is just about everything. No giant demons who hurl fireballs...no beholders, etc, etc, etc. What you'll see on screen is a run of the mill sci-fi action flick. Its sad, really. This film could have been so good...Why would anyone in their right mind forego the chance to be original for the sake of doing something that's already been done? What were the filmmakers smoking? Idiots."
2,Doom (Unrated Widescreen Edition),"Lots of blood, lots of Fx, zero acting skills and zero story line! If you manage to endure all of this movie, you will only watch it once."
1,hollywood is running out of movie ideas,maybe making beer commercials into movies is the next frontier.this is rent worthy if you have a need to feel as dumb as a ''rock''.
1,Why even call it Doom?,"In the original game, a research facility on Mars opens a portal to hell and you being the lone survivor needs to get out. I'm guessing instead of sticking with a horror/action movie that could have been good they just decided to completely change the entire premise. Instead of Mars, it's a space station. Instead of a lone survivor, it's a 'team' sent there. Instead of a portal to Hell, it's a virus. Let's see a virus strain that's messed everyone up and a team is sent in to fix it....sounds a lot like Resident Evil doesn't it. Original! This is another movie meant for 15 year old boys that more interested in action than actual storyline.I say if your going to do a video game movie, at least keep it true to the original storyline that way if it bombs (like this movie did) the game fans will at least be somewhat happy with it."
2,Wouldn't recommend,"Now that many of the regular actions heroes are getting older or are on their ""way out"", The Rock must make most of this opportunity to establish himslef as the next action hero but somehow that doesn't seem to be happening inspite of his potential. Doom is a good example of this. Looks as though the movie was made to ride on the success of the popular PC game. The plot, special fx and cast are not bad but the action is stale and mediocre. The zombies and creatures are poor imitations from earlier horror and action movies and fail to impress. The Rock in the end switching his role to become the bad guy was another let down. Check out ""The Rundown"" (a.k.a ""Welcome to the Jungle"" in the UK, Australia and Asia) and you'll be convinced The Rock can be the next big action hero but certainly not this one."
1,Wasted my time,"This is an awful movie. avoid at all costs. I wouldnt see it if it were free. If you want to own it, wait a few weeks, it should be about $1. If it were a stock, I'd short it."
3,"Good, But not the best","This movie was alright, but it could of been much better. It has a pretty good plot, ok actors, but many things wrong. To start, the blood looked like it was water with red die. Second the First person mode was good, but they compleatly copied Resident Evil 4 with the Zompie and the Chain Saw. Third, the Rock is the Bad guy, what good movie has the rock as a mean zombie. Over all, don't buy this movie, rent it, it will save you some money."
2,Doom - a bit on the disappointing side,"I really liked this film better when it was called ""Resident Evil""Creatures were cool, but the story left me a bit disapointed.I do love everything I've seen starring ""The Rock"", just this one - didnt care for his character - The DVD unrated, I couldnt really detect any differences from the theatrical release. Something about this film also really made me sleepy watching it both times.(Eyesofchaos dot com)"
2,Just not very good,"See, i'm of the opinion that the original plotline for Doom, a lone space marine up against the forces of Hell, COULD have made a great movie. It would be a one man show mostly, but that's when a creative script could add in additional characters. Creating this whole team of marines is just retreading old ground. And the special effects just aren't that special. It was disappointing on pretty much every level. and while i really like Rock, his acting abilities are lacking (fortunately he knows this and isn't deterred).The great, horrible monsters from the original games are completely ignored, when they should have been showcased as the real attractors. They were in the video game, they should have been in the video game movie. The cacodemons, the fireball imps, the Barons of Hell, the rocket launching Cyberdemon, everything has been stripped out and we're left with low budget[...].Maybe Doom 2 can pull a miracle out..."
3,OK... but then again,"For all Doom afectionados, this movie is NOT what you'd expect.If you were expecting the Hell version of Doom, forget it. I was quite disappointed in the logic behind not using the game theme. Medical experimentation gone awry has been done so many times, some quite well such as Resident Evil, and some not.So why not just say that in the excavation of the moon, a portal was opened allowing alien demons to come forth? Sounds too simple to me and yet it was not done that way.So much for the Doom story.As for the movie? It was actually enjoyable. If you know nothing of Doom, this movie actually works. The special effects were quite good.The acting was half way decent. The Rock did a good job, as did Karl Urban. So if you are looking for a thrilling sci-fi gore fest, this may please you and the story line does work, but not for the Doomsters out there."
2,...its ok,"This movie would probably be pretty awesome if you had no idea what the game Doom was about or have never played it. Overall its not a bad movie. Its just a failed attempt to create a movie from a video game story. In the game, researchers are doing experiments dealing with the planet Mars and they manage to open a portal to hell. Thats an absolutly terrifying story that would make for a great movie. But no. They had to go and change it to some sort of experiments that had nothing to do with hell. I just think it would have been much better is they would have left it alone. The cast isn't bad. The Rock I think did very well in it. The first person scene was pretty cool as well. Overall good movie. Just a bad transition from a video game to the big screen. I mean it could have been worse. Uwe Boll could have made it..."
1,Let's Confuse Doom with Resident Evil shall we?,"This movie is not based upon the popular Doom games at all. It does have the UAC, it does have the BFG 9000 and it does have blood and gore...but this isn't Doom. In the game, the monsters came from hell and are not borrowed from Resident Evil. In the game, there's no mention of a ""super being"" ever being on Mars. In the game, they didn't experiment on people to produce a ""super being"". The idea of experiments changing people into monsters comes from Resident Evil and not Doom. Do NOT confuse Doom with Resident Evil and do not make a movie of it. The movie is more based on Resident Evil than it is on Doom. And The Rock should be embrassed being in a movie that's NOT base on the game of the same name."
1,Arrogant Holloywood Jerks!,This garbage movie is a perfect example of the jerks in Hollywood who think they know everything! Why pay for the rights to a well known franchise then stupidly completely change the story? The owners of these franchises need to stop selling out and retain some control so the Hollywood jerks do not completely butcher their stories.
2,Movie OK- Sound Quality was horrible!,"Movie was Ok but the sound quality was alful. Sadly as I have stated in my previous review of the forth kind, I do not have these problems with any other competing service I use. Due to this I will start spendingMy money elsewhere in this dept."
3,Decent But Predictable,"Even if you are familiar with the game Doom, the film is average. Even though the plot is predictable and similar to Alien, Karl Urban makes you watch until the end."
2,"Overlong, unoriginal, dull, blah blah blah","I've never played the video game the movie is based on so I'm only reviewing the movie for what it was. A bunch of marines are called to a research facility on Mars that is accessed from a portal on Earth. When they get there they find that the scientists have been attacked by some kind of creature and are now transforming.Sadly, there is nothing original in this movie. Marines going in to investigate a distress call: check. Special effects monsters: check. Scientists doing secret, ill-advised work: check. Lighting so dark you can't see what's going on: check. Humans transforming into murderous creatures: check.There is nothing here you haven't seen before in a better movie and worst of all it's a pretty dull ride. There is no suspense, no surprises, just one rote scene after another."
4,Wow,"I never played the Doom games but this movie was so cool. The special effects in this movie were life-like and I really enjoyed myself watching it. The plot didn't disappoint, either. Buy it, watch it, love it."
3,Doom,"I think Doom is the best adaptation of a video game, turned film. There was lots of action, good acting(especially from Karl Urban), wicked effects, and a fairly decent plot. I`m just glad it wasn`t cheesy like the Resident Evil films. This wasn`t The Rock`s best performance, but he was good in it. This film was totally worth the money."
2,Shoot up effects are okay,In the end it is not the special effects that make a movie but the story. The story was silly and bad acting did not help.A group of soldiers go into a place. Shoot it up. The hero ends out fighting with his commanding officer over a disagreement over how to contain the infection.
5,Good memories,"Good quality bluray for sound and video. I remember playing the old video games, so I got a kick out of the characters and the first person action at one point."
3,Story deterent.,"I was under the impression that Doom was based on beings from Hell, not martians and genetic testing.What was up with the enemies? All they had was the dog looking thing with wheels, which I never saw before, the things that looked liked Imps from the games, and the general ""grunts"".Other than that I thought the movie was good. If a sequel is going to be made they need to make improvements."
4,Not Bad.,"For a movie based on a game really Bad. For a movie to watch, not to bad. Just fun to watch."
3,doom,"All around a fun movie. Hard to get involved with characters but they are entertaining. especially the guy in the wheelchair. (watch what he changes into) also, was it me or was that girl who stars in it high as a kite. I mean look at her eyes. Her pupils are totally dialated. Me thinks someone is a coke fan and not the kind you drink!!!!!! The end is for true doom fans!!!! Gotta watch this if you like the game or the rock. Also, to see what I mean about the girl, you have to watch in hd somehow. So much detail."
1,Does not deserve its title,"Being a huge fan of Doom and Doom2 games from Id Software, I was really disappointed when I learned the original game idea - of UAC corporation researching teleportation and accidentally opening portal to Hell - was stripped away from this movie, being replaced with some ""genetic experiments gone bad"" cliche. I dont want to know who and why decided to change the way it should be, but it just doesnt work. No Cyberdemon in Doom movie? What a shame... This movie does not deserve its title. And without demonspawn from hell - well, it is just another Aliens clone. Do yourself a favor and watch Resident Evil instead - where ""genetic experimentation"" idea really works. Not to mention that Resident Evil is much better movie overall - no yawning through half of the movie for action to start."
2,Below Average,"Maybe Doom the video game is an excellent video game classic for fans of that type of game. However, Doom the movie doesn't hit the mark for fans of this type of film. It's not the worse film in this genre by any means but it doesn't have that certain ingredient that say Resident Evil has that lifts that movie up to an above average rating. Check Doom the movie out but don't expect anything special."
1,Another game movie down the drain,"Sure this movie have some big name actors and actresses in it, but because we see these big action stars going at it with ""Mutants"" does it really match what the story and plot from the game? The answer is no. I admit I like the whole moving and no stopping but the story in it sucked. It did not follow off what it was really intend to be, an experiment with the teleporter that sent them to hell, not genetic's. Also the whole plot took place on mars not earth. The whole movie looks more like ""Resident Evil"". I think they got their story mix up with ""Resident Evil"" over ""Doom"" itself. I agree with the critics on this. I'm not normally agreeing with them but this movie is an exception. I'm glad I saw it from a friends copy rather wastingabout $20 on it and then be disappointed. So for those who have not played the game this movie would be just another action/horror. But for those who have, it isn't worth seeing and just stick with the game itself to be satisfied."
3,Totally neutral,"Keep it simple. If you enjoyed the whole series of Doom computer games, then this is a must see, it is dark and sinister and spooky. Doom has lots of dark hallways and big guns, but no plot that matters. On the other hand, if you are interested in the whole genetic monsters versus guys with guns theme, you will find the Resident Evil trilogy far more satisfying; it has guns and genetically transformed humans AND a plot."
3,A Survivable Experience,There is only one reason to watch this: Rosamund Pike. That's reason enough. Too bad she doesn't work more; too bad she doesn't have more scenes here. My pet gripe about this film is that many scenes are simply too dark. Rather than being scary it's just murky. Watch Jennifer 8 to see darkness handled properly onscreen.
4,Resident Alien,"The previous reviewer didn't like this movie. I loved it.It bums me out that if I hadn't seen it before reading the previous review, I might not have watched it.If you like the Resident Evil movies, and/or like playing video games; then you will probably like this movie."
3,Action with a little suspense,"I never played the game, but watching this movie made me think this is how the game must look like on the screen. If you like The Movie Alien, you might like this. Some of the same feel to it. Moments of on the edge of your seat suspense before all out action. Seemed more like a made for TV movie or direct video. But it is still worth watching. If you are not a big fan of the game...rent it. I borrowed it from the library."
3,Swat team on Mars,A transgenetic human with 24 chromosomes ( like Down's syndrome)hunts the search and destroy team sent from Earth.The acting isn't the best and the idea is pretty muchlike a lot of other ancient civilization archways toother planets( you don't need a spaceship set or time getting there).The reanimating zombie idea of an infectious gene transmutationvirus isn't very pleasant either.Not the best sci fi movie...
4,"Don't flame it, it was made after a game...","I think, this movie was very good, giving it the fact that is was made after a game, don't hate it becasue it was bad, it was made after a game, so you shouldn't have been so uppity about it in the first place, i actually thought they did a great job, even though the story was not like the any of the games, (hell, they never said it would be, so don't get all mad about that either), i jsut think that this movie really deserved soem better reviews and some more love, i jsut think that most people didn't like it because they never palyed the game, so please, paly it first before you make fun of it."
3,game movie bomb,"I thought the movie was really good the plot may have had some of the game fragments, but it demonstrated that sometimes that sometimes the movie can be even better than the games. In this case I think that the game was better than the movie considering this movie had nothing to do with the game and instead they turned it into a cross between Aliens and Resident Evil which I thought was a bad idea. They also screwed with the idea of using some old idea that involved using a person's soul which was also a bad idea. I would really be surprised if they made another movie. For Doom fans stick with the games and the books."
1,One of the worst pieces of crap I have ever seen,"There is often something to be said for schlocky science fiction. Done right and one is transported back to childhood and watching Creature Double Feature on Saturday afternoons.Then there is something like this that is boring, needlessly gory, bad scifi, and complete un-entertaining. You would think with Dwayne Johnson (a.k.a. The Rock) it would at least have a sense of humor about itself."

5,Loco Love-it,"I LOVE this movie!!! It is a little older, but still very cute! I have watched it many times! I reccomend this movie to ANY romantic out there!"
2,Fine film but Terrible Print.,"Having waited many years to see this film, I was anticipating a great quality DVD print for the price. Imagine my surprise when I sat down to enjoy it for the first time and noticed scratches and tears (think the opening credits of John Cassavete's Johnny Staccato. The full frame format makes it impossible to read the credits without losing half of thenames.You would think such a rare gem as this would deserve to be remastered and preserved.Having said that. Sonia Wilde and James Franciscus give excellent perormances and the supporting cast are fine."
1,"Film didn't pass, really flunked.","This film had every chance in the world to make a meaningful statement about racial prejudice and threw each one away. Sonja Wilde's part, where she is obviously white or pale, is not very believable when she tells an employer she is part black so she can't get a job. James Franciscus overacts as her racist husband, but his script is at fault. The story needed some compelling event where she could admit she was part black and he could try to accept it (ex. the baby lived and resembled him as the real father) but instead he only rants and raves that she shouldn't socialize with black people. A bit too long where our bride must lie about her black father with no DVD extras to relieve the tedium."
2,The Perils of Passing Lite,"This movie comes off like a cautionary film screened for junior high girls during health class. The narrative is about as sophisticated as a beach-blanket flick, with flat, coarsely drawn caricatures and a simplistic, predictable plot. The dialogue is so juvenile that the fewer lines a player has, the more credible is his/her performance.The passing protagonist speaks with an unaccountably Mexican-sounding accent, creating a constant subconscious perception that she is Hispanic. Moreover, her thespian skills are barely passable and glaringly so in the presence of otherwise competent actors.The only interesting scene in the movie is one in which the protagonist boogies down a bit too heartily at a country-clubbish dance. The action descends into utter farce as her priggish husband and in-laws react in a silly, stereotypical parody of uptight white folks.Otherwise, the film is watchable only as a curiosity."
4,Roberto Roena is a true genius.,"This was one of the finest efforts by Roena and the Apollo Sound. The album includes the very strange sounding, but good ""Oriza Eh"" qhich I believe has to do with African culture as did much of salsa. ""Marunga"" is a slow paced Son Montuno that features Adalberto on the chorus and Yomo Toro stroking the strings.Now on to the best part: ""Cui Cui"" is an unforgettable classic that's very soulful and funky sounding. ""Que se sepa"" is another great song with a ""Cui Cui"" style of music. And last but no least, my favorite ""Avisale a mi Contrario."" This track is one that puts others ""on notice"" with ""tiraera"" or jabs at other singers that has been around since the Beny More days of music. I did not give this 5 stars because of the 2 boleros and the merengue track that was inexplicably included, otherwise this album includes several true classics that continue to entertain us decades later."
4,Good For The Price,"I bought these pearl earrings as an impluse buy (couldn't resist the rock-bottom price) and I'm pretty happy with them. My set were equally sized and similar in color. I did however, expect them to be more lusterous... But with them being under $20, you really can't complain."
5,Definitely Akoyas!,"These are genuine Akoyas and they're beautiful. They have a nice, shiny luster. I ordered 4 pairs at this price to give as gifts for Christmas this year. They're all in the 7 to 7.5 mm range. The color is slightly different from pair to pair (some whiter, some pinker), but the earrings for each set match perfectly. I'm very pleased with this purchase and will buy more sets because they're the perfect, have-on-hand gift for birthdays, too!"
1,junk,"In good lighting from even a couple feet away there are very obvious visible flaws. The shade of the pearls is pretty. Paid $17 for them, and reviewing them as if they cost $17. They are going in the garbage. I would love to return them... I have managed to lose both the flimsy fasteners in not even ten minutes time. The rod that goes through the ear... whatever that is called is notched, so a decent amount of force sometimes has to be applied to remove the fasteners at which point they go flying. The box they came with is quite nice for $17.I really don't know pearls all that well, but I do understand jewellery. I don't know what they are smoking if they think these are worth $75. I am not at all pleased at $17, and wish I could return them, though I've lost the fasteners. Amazon has quite a nice selection of jewellery, but maybe pearls are one of those things that just must be bought in person."
5,5-port hdmi,they sent in on timeit works just the way it shouldthe price is half what my ditribtor wants
2,"Good, but not for everything","I have one of these and while it works very reliably for some things (Motorola cable box and Roku box), it very reliably FAILS to work with my Toshiba HD-A2 HD-DVD player and my Oppo 981 DVD player. Symptom is picture appears for a few seconds as the DVD player turns on...then nothing.Called Monoprice (on line chat) and their answer was ""sometimes things work and sometimes they don't"".Wow!Great customer support."
5,Very reliable - excellent value,"This unit works great for switching HDMI inputs. I am using all 5 device ports and they all make solid connections to a 75foot HDMI cable run to my video projector.I found that I needed a better quality cable for my Blu-ray player but all the other devices work without issues. One nice feature is that it seems to automatically select which ever input is active. Very handy if only one device is powered on.I expected to have to pay twice what this unit costs so this is truly a great value.I agree other reviewers that the LED indicators are too bright when displaying red, but that can be resolved by angling the box away from the viewer."
3,Handshake problems,"My switch is connected to a cable box, Apple TV, and a Roku box. The output goes to a 1-year old LG LCD TV. Monoprice has been very quick to respond to my emails, but have no fix for the sound dropping out intermittently. They have told me to return the unit (at my expense - they don't pay for return postage when the issue is compatibility) and try another model. I can see where this is going. I will do one iteration with them. Hopefully it will work, but I'm skeptical."
2,Seems good on paper but its not all its cracked up to be,Seems to work but slowwwww in switching from port to port manually. If you use the remote then its fine
2,not satisified with this device,Device seemed to work well and then began spurious switching between inputs. Device was advertised as IR from a remote control but it seemed thatany noise emitted from a dog's chain or just unloading the dishwasher and it would switch the input resulting in loss of program being watched.Finally disconnected it and haven't tried using it again.
3,"Functions well but requires constant power,.","Unit switches slowly between inputs with no apparent loss of quality. When turned off and on, or power is interrupted unit makes no input selection and must be reset to desired input. Thus unit appears to be designed to be left on continuosly ."
3,Check the price,"This cleaner works,but it comes with a big shipping charge.Check the store prices first and weigh it against the shipping charge."
3,The jury is still out.,"I just bought the Bissell Quicksteamer which came with a trial size of this. My carpet has not been deep cleaned for at least 3 years. The first time I used this, I followed the manufacturer's instruction on dilution and did not notice my carpet was visibly cleaner afterwards. The water it extracted was dirty though so it obviously got some of the soil out. The carpet also dried quickly, within an hour as opposed to the 4 hours it said on the manual. Although not VISIBLY cleaner, my carpet did feel softer and fluffier compared to the areas I have not cleaned yet. Excited to see if a second cleaning would show an obvious improvement, I cleaned a 2nd time and used more concentrated solution this time. Nope. Didn't look any cleaner. I dont know if it is my machine or the solution. I am looking at trying a different brand of solution. I will probably try on of those oxy ones. So far, the jury is still out on this product."
5,Ismael's timeless solo debut album for Vaya Records.,"After spending nearly two decades as Eddie Palmieri's lead singer, Ismael Quintana opted for a solo career and signed with the Fania-affiliated Vaya Records label in 1974. This self-titled debut album is both an absolute classic and features the ageless masterpieces ""Mi Debilidad"", La Blusita Colora"" and ""Tambo, Me Acompana El"". The album's other songs are by no means mediocre but the three above-mentioned masterpieces simply overshadow them. If and when this album does become available as a remastered CD you absolutely MUST get it...no ifs, ands or buts about it! Ismael's other albums for Vaya were by no means bad but this was his all-time best work."
4,An intimate conversation with an adventurous sage,"Charles A. Lindbergh, first person to fly the Atlantic alone, is a fascinating character. This book, written at the end of his life, is a glimpse in the fertile mind of a great man. He tells the story of being one of the first modern media celebrities, an unsought burden. We also follow him through his careers as a pilot in World War II and as a medical researcher.The real appeal of this book is not the facts of Lindbergh's life, amazing and interesting as they are. The true privilege for the reader is to hear Lindbergh ruminate on the nature of life and spirituality, the ways to remain sane and centered in modern society, and what it means to be an individual while part of a team.Lindbergh emerges from this memoir as a deep and warm human, one whose passage through this plane touched so many in a positive way."
3,A Excellent Work about an Odd and Flawed Man,"I doubt that Lindbergh realized how odd and self-absorbed he would come across in this autobiography. He was cleared a gifted and brilliant man, but one who failed to realize that self-canonization is not an acceptable act for most mortals. His less than disguised bigotry and his last minute attempts to hide his serial adultery and illegitimate children further tarnish him as a man. He lived life large, in reality and more so in his own mind. That is my judgment, harsh though it may be."
1,Values ????,30 years after his death we find out that he had three mistresses in Europe and fathered 7 illegitimate children with them. Some values. This book is extremely hard to read after finding that out about the man.
1,This does not deliver on it's title,This book is a humor book and does not deliver anything related to basic farming.
4,"Good CD, but missing some songs","I think this CD is awesone, except I think that ""Honest"" from ""Rachael Lampa"" should've been on there. And the remixes are kinda dumb, I would've had just one remix and that's the remix of ""Blessed"", cause that's the title. Plus I would've added ""Ave Maria"" from ""WOW Christmas (Red)"" cause it's really pretty. All in all it's good. My favorite song is ""I'm All Yours"""
5,CD Carousel,Fulfills all its promises; great space saver. Very quick response. Delighted with this item.
2,cd carousel,"my computer won't recognize this item without a driver installed, and i can't install drivers because my computer won't recognize it. it knows something is on the usb bus but needs drivers to recognize it. the manufacture's web site was no help. the software refuses to run until the unit is recognized by the computer. the power is on and a good usb cable is installed, but it still won't run. i guess i can still use it to store my cd's and dvd's, but the database sure would be handy."
1,Major disappointment,"When I was a kid, my older brother had this fairly-large, oval-shaped moving sand picture-toy. It was so cool and I absolutely loved to play with it until it broke and eventually disappeared one day (probably got thrown out).Ever since then, I've been searching for the same item and this product is the closest I've seen. I was thrilled when it arrived in the mail until I discovered that, unfortunately, it's a sad facsimile. It is much smaller than the one we had, the sand/liquid just don't flow the same way, and the sand is constantly getting stuck here and there. I recently came across one of these in our local thrift shop and noticed it had the same problem. I imagine the former owner probably donated it for that reason.I guess I was spoiled by the quality of the original version we had years ago. I sure wish I could find it somewhere again. As far as this item is concerned, all I can say is that, sadly, they just don't make things the way they used to."
3,Made of cheap plastic,"These moving sand frames are hard to find, and my wife has one that quit working. The sand is stuck and won't move at all. I bought this one, and was surprised by the cheap plastic design. I removed the (sandwiched glass w/ sand) plastic frame, and made my own from solid oak. I also made my own pedestal from oak, and stained it."
3,"Some problems, but...","This game has one truly annoying glitch. If you use the first three cards dealt, and empty the stack, it will penalize you. To clarify, it penalizes you after 3 runs through the deck, and treats using the first card as if you'd completely gone through the deck. This makes achieving a perfect score very difficult. I read a review of another model of this game, made by the same company, and it has the same problem. I end up attempting to win without using the top card until last, which frequently doesn't work. However, considering the number of hours I have wasted playing it, it can't be that bad. I play it in bed, and find it easy to see if the batteries are fresh. The buttons are small, but that's to be expected in a small handheld game. It is comfortable to hold, and I like the protective flip top. If not for the glitch, I'd give it 4 stars."
3,Solitaire Light Up Game,"If you can't see the cards, then you need to replace the batteries. If you leave the light on it will use up the batteries.One Card: you can only go through the deck one time, so I've never bothered to play this one.Three Card: I usually win with this one about 30% of the time.Sound: can be turned off.I haven't had any problems with the buttons. I play this fairly often. The randomization isn't that great, frequently you get a card in three different suits on a deal, or within a few cards of beginning a game. It seems like it frequently gets three aces and then a two of the fourth suit, or three twos and and the ace of the fourth.I enjoy playing this game -- I guess I've gotten used to it."
3,NOT an improvement,"As usual, Verizon service is EXCELLENT!But Radica Lighted Solitaire is NOT an improvement over previous Radica Solitaire models. It is bulky, cumbersome, and placement of buttons does not enhance the game. I'm looking for some older models to replace ones we have WORN OUT."
3,Girl with a watering can,The puzzle is too hard for my 9 year old. It is a large box but the puzzle is much larger than the printed picture which cannot be used as a guide.
5,Works Great!,This thing works flawlessly. Open the package and follow the directions and you won't have a single problem
2,"not good, better available","This worked with some of my gadgets some of the time. The drivers were a pain to install. I could also never get it to work without it's own program. It would be easy to think it works well if you have never tried anything else and you have compatible hardware. I got a much, much smaller dongle for around $2 that works better and does not require a driver (it is a windows supplied driver)"
5,Das Meisterstück!!! (A Masterpiece!!!),"Let us give thanks to Mr. Dulias for coming forward with the courage to tell his tale, a side of World War II seldom, if ever, heard about. Told with naked honesty, this book gives us a startling glimpse of the brutality of being held prisoner in a Russian Gulag, and to what lengths it took to survive under such gut wrenching torture. This is a piece of history that the world needs to hear about, and thanks to Mr. Dulias, it is being heard.Of particular enjoyment was the recounting of Mr. Dulias' flying days. Told in such vivid detail, you, the reader, feel as though you're the co-pilot, along for the ride of your life.To NOT read Another Bowl of Kapusta is to suffer in total ignorance about what REALLY happened during the war. History professors take notice, this book must be included your students required reading!Thank you again, Mr. Dulias, for uncorking your life story that you have kept bottled up for so long."
5,Another Bowl Of Kapusta - A True Life Story,"This book can easily be read in two days. Like a Time Capsule it takes you back in time. It is about one man's survival through the rise, fall and aftermath of the Hitler Regime. Once a young boy with many hopes and dreams, he then became a young man and enlisted to become a World War II Luftwaffe Fighter Pilot. After five confirmed air victories his Me-109 (Messerschmitt) was shot down and he was forced to make a bellylanding. He was then captured and became a POW in the Gulags of Russia. He has lived in America for over fifty years and is now an Advisor and Re-Enactor with the newly formed group known as LARA (Luftwaffe Aircrew Re-Enactors Association). You may even be lucky to meet him at one of the ever popular World War II Weekends."
4,Husband and wife review:,"Wow! What a wonderful story about the resilience of the human spirit in the wake of adversity. This book preserves the little-known details of daily life for a boy and his family during 1930s Germany, and paints a stark picture of war's impact as the young man reaches adulthood.Knowingly or not, the author has written a story about how the forces of the universe achieve balance: -- how a boy growing up in the midst of priveldge and wealth later finds himself working for others for meager pay -- how a young prisoner of war wasted away to skin and bones, in the same way as the Jews who were imprisoned by the young soldier's government. Thanks for sharing this remarkable story!"
1,"Interesting story, needs more aviation content and more editing","While the story is interesting, this book is poorly written. It is a shame because I think told properly, this could be much more engaging. Its not surprising this book is published by Author House - other more traditional publishing companies would probably not take the book in its current form.The subtitle of the book indicates it is the story of a World War II Luftwaffe Fighter Pilot. As such, one might expect there to be more content related to flying. Almost 100 pages pass before there is any significant aviation related material.On the positive side, there are some interesting anecdotes, its just unfortunate the story was not better told."
3,Not exactly what it appears to be,"I bought this on the basis of what I see on the title. It's a great biography, and you can't help but like the auther. On the other side of it, if you seek intensive fighting history on a personal basis in WW 2, you won't find it here. The description of being a pow in russia is somewhat more detailed, but again it is a little piece in the overall picture. This is an actual biography (and a good one at that), but don't buy it on the basis of the cover ! It truly is not a ""Forgotten Soldier"" by guy sajer, or any other war book. It is strictly a good autobiographical work and may appeal to many. But investigate thoroughly, if you are seeking detailed, actual account military history, because this is not it, and the author actually states that."
5,"amazing, funny anime","GTO was the first anime, besides DBZ that I'd ever seen and the first in Japanese. I have to agree with other reviewers. The English track is terrible. The Japanese voice actors are much better. Just a warning, you have to stick with it past the first few episodes. It starts out with Onizuka, a man in his mid-twenties trying to get a peek up teenage girls' skirts and him fantasizing about a 16 year old wife. (Note: age of consent is a bit lower in Japan I believe). He's not really a pedophile, just immature. If you bear with the beginning you'll love it. Onizuka wants to be a teacher very badly, even if his motives are a bit warped at times. Despite his sometimes lack of maturity, his heart is in the right place and he does what is right every time (though the principal's car gets destroyed several times in the process) It has a great storyline, lots of action, a little romance (with a woman his age), and tons of humor. Trust me, you'll love it!"
1,it came on time,it was what i wanted but it was the japnese voice with english subtiles i didnt need that. the quilty was poor let alone the the captions for the anime was cut off so you couldnt read it. i talk to the people and they were nice i guess they didnt know how to sell it
5,A clear and insightful account of post-modernism.,"Ray Linn has broken down a very complex subject into a clear and insightful book for teachers. He takes the reader through the issues from many different perspectives, including art, literature, and history. Above all, he presents the material in a manner so that teachers can make it accessible to their high school students."
1,This storyline is upsettting to children !,"As a former children's librarian. I am very familiar with the many wonderful books Jesse Haas has written--but I really expected more from this book than was delivered. Little children (and many adults) love chipmunks. They're extremely cute animals and most children are familiar with them scampering around on the outskirts of their yards. They also know what cat's DO to chipmunks. Although that is a fact in nature, children are often distressed by that. This chipmunk is running for it's life--these are NOT ""cute"" antics. I regret purchasing this book and hope Jessie Haas will find a less grim storyline for future children's books."
2,Bad seal,We normally love the Bodum products but this one is a good design but poorly manufactured. We have sold several of them and the seals leak into the electrical wiring below in the pot. Never was a saftey issue just leaked all the time! Too much hassle to get them replaced so we refunded monies.
1,Positives and Negatives.,Positives:1.Very good to look at.2.well making.Negatives:1.Price.2.Takes time to clean and to reload.3.AN ACCIDENT WAITING TO HAPPEN.4.More coffee.5.Maintenance.6.Be ware : when u reheat keep watching it otherwise water will go out.*Different coffee taste ( maybe better maybe not )
3,Good but...,"I dunno, it's a good product for my needs but IMHO it's not good for enterprise Database work."
2,Corner Tv Stand,"The exact dimensions of this cabinet were not given. The cabinet is not shaped like a triangle so the depth measurement is misleading. It would have been nice to see a drawing with exact measurements. It is actually too big for the space. However, now that it has been assembled - it came in a flat box, it would be too much to take it apart and send back. Keeping it but not satisified with the result."
5,Characteristics and roles of a godly woman!,"This book focuses on preparing women for marriage, motherhood and ministry. It may not be popular with the feminists of our day who believe freedom and self-realization mean having no commitments and responsibilities for others. As a woman first submits her will, life and future to God, who created her, she can then begin to find out who she truly was meant to be in this life."
3,Probably worth $6,"Such a deal, this movie for less than ten bucks. However, it is 4:3 letterboxed and not the most pristine print ever seen. The packaging looks like a copy of some original packaging and there is nothing extra inside the case. I must admit that I have not watched it all the way through so if there are other imperfections or defects I have not found them yet. I feel like I got about what I paid for and so I'm not complaining. Better versions may be available (cleaner print, true widescreen) but they cost more. If you want a copy of this movie that's better than that old VHS off of cable and don't want to spend $30, this is for you."
4,Loved the Ending,"I have been wanting to see this film since it came out, as I generally like Harlan Ellison's work ( though I have not read the novella from which this movie was made ).The film was great, but I really loved the ending. Tell me. . .is there any man alive that doesn't identify with this?"
1,This has to be the absolute worst film ever!,"I had to watch this movie for a school project, and I have to say; Its bad. The story it's self isn't to terrible, but it does needs some work. Everything else in the movie,whether its the acing or what ever, is however awful. I don't want to sound like a reluctant student trying to trash a film, but after watching the movie; I felt like I had wasted two hours of my life. I especially didn't like the ending when the two main characters show how much they care for each other. Come-on would anyone in their right mind, feed their dog, their friend; just because they have a love-hate relation ship with the K9? I wouldnt."
3,A Cult Classic,"""A Boy and His Dog"" (1975) is science-fiction satire based on a well-known Harlan Ellison story. The movie takes us on the adventures of a young scavenger, Vic, (a VERY young Don Johnson) and his intelligent, telepathic dog, Blood, in post-apocalyptic Arizona. Blood and Vic need each other to survive, to find food for both and the girls for Vic. Blood is always hungry, and Vic always wants a woman. That's the common through-line of the entire movie, and it drives Vic to do things he might not normally do. Or might he? This low tech, well-paced film is dark and funny, making it deserving of its cult status."
1,A Boy and His Dog (Remastered 1975 edition),"The quality of this remastered edition was so bad it was almost impossible to watch. Even though it was described as being in 4/3 format, it was somehow, in a widescreen format and extremely pixillated. I would recommend that this be removed from Amazon's catalog."
4,basic human nature,A well written story about the morals of a split sociaty. those who have given up much of their humanity for individule survival and a counter part that that has given up their humanity for social survival. It goes to the root of the human id. Though the screen play is a bit week at times; the overall effect is one that leaves a lasting impression.
5,A Boy And HIs Dog what a title,This is another of the bad B cult movies that came out in the 80's. The acting is ok with this being Don Johnson before the Miami Vice days. The talking dog is probably the best part of the film. But still one of those that if you like this kind of movie you'll love it.
1,"horrible, just horrible","This is definitely one of the worst movies ever; a totally misguided, misogynistic mess. The characters are completely unlikable, as is the stream-of-consciousness provided by Harlan Ellison and L Q Jones. Although its post-apocalyptic vision predates Mad Max, it is far inferior in every possible way. The introductory scene with Susanne Benton is just about the only part worth watching, the rest is garbage."
1,Old crud,"I saw this over at a friend's house years ago. A post apocalypse tale of a guy who basically ends up eating his new lover. This show had so many bad ""B-film"" cliches it was hard to watch. I think the only reason it was ever popular amongst the geeky set (yes I was and still belong) is the tongue and cheek plot that resembled Soylent Green after Waaaaaaaayyyyyyy to much weed or possibly LSD . . . and the sexual innuendo.I hated this flick for the same reason I hated such adolescent staples like Beavus and Butthead . . . I either thought of it before or did it before and ""it"" was pretty mundane.The plot moves at a snails pace and after it's over you realize you just wasted all that time for a bad punchline on a lame joke . . . that you could see coming a mile away."
1,A Boy & His Dog,"The only thing partially funny and entertaining about the film is the telepathic dog,everything else is like a boring mad max,the plot then goes in circles with underground clown face painted people and then fastforward to tubes tied up to Don's Johnson to help impregnate the women and finally you have Cannibalism(but not seen from the Camera and just by the dog) And this is a Classic? Based on A Novel...Thank God I didn't read the novel. One of the worst End of the World or Near the End or what's left movies."
2,letter box sucks,"Old movies arn't always like you remember them but is still a good nostalgic experience,it's just too bad letter box format dosn't enhance the experience.2 out of 5"
1,"maybe this was good ""back then"" ... but not anymore!","I can't believe this movie got so many good reviews! I decided to rent it this past weekend and was horrified by how terrible it really is. We watched the first 15 minutes, and then fast forwarded to any interesting looking scenes, only to realize that they weren't interesting after all. I feel sorry for all the people who watched this movie in its entirety. It was incredibly slow and absolutely horrible."
2,Was there a point to this movie?,"I despised the main character, a nomadic rapist. There was nothing at all worthwhile about him. The movie sets him up as being a survivor only by very contrived writing. He is able to raid a gang only because the gang is the apocalyptic equivalent of the Keystone Cops. He waves his gun around in town - this will get a loner shot 100% of the time.The ""choice"" he makes between the girl and the dog is also contrived. If you actually stop to think for a moment (warning, having a mind and using it destroys any chance of ejoying this film!), he had plenty of choices (there was food right behind that door if he made a quick raid).Frankly, the only way I can see that this movie would have any appeal is if your emotional development stopped at 12, and you like having sex with women, but really dislike women themselves."
4,Really fun movie,"For those of you who have yet to watch this movie, I highly recommend it. It's humorous and to watch a pre-stubbled Johnson is a treat. My favorite scene is when he is told he was picked to inseminate the women and he immediately assumes it's jolly time but this society has other plans and to watch the expression on his face when he is told the truth is priceless. Awesome movie."
2,A Boy and his Dog,Not a bad movie but not a award winner either! But the service was great ahead of the scheduled delivery date as per their instructions the disc had to be tried on a different dvd player if not working on one it worked great on the other with the right code and was in new condition not a scratch I will use them again
3,"Don't come exepectting 'Miami Vice' Don Johnson,,...","I did finally watch this, and let me say, I was plesantly suprised.Based on a Harlan Ellison novella, the story wazs actually entertaining!Robards plays the leader of a cult. A judeo Christian cult who claims the hero, Don Johnson, for their own. He is to impregnate the women, the males having all become sterile. Don Johnson falls in 'love' with a member of the cult, and facilitates his love by sharing her meat with his dog!A truely great post-appocaliptic love story!'A boy loves his dog.'"
3,Addendum to the former reviews,"Though I can not give a better review of ""A Boy and His Dog"" than some of those already posted, I would like to add a note about collecting the works of L. Q. Jones. It is still rather hard for me to believe that he directed this movie (introducing Don Johson) the same year that I became aware of his talent as an actor. If you value a movie collection that is varied and interesting, look for the name L. Q. Jones. He is the ""Renaissance Man"" of 20th Century, Hollywood."
4,A Really Funny Satire,"I hate to disagree with the other reviewer. He does make some good points. However, we are dealing with Harlan Ellison here and with Ellison, nothing is ever as it seems. This is a rather dumb story. It is. Even on the printed page, it's a rather dumb story. However, much of Ellison is dumb stories to make points, and that is what this is. Ellison is dark. He doesn't much like people. Most of his stories are somewhat bleak. This one, though, at least has some laughs. If you really want dark, see if they ever make a film out of the final installment of the story of Blood. Talk about bleak and terrifying!!!! This is fun to watch, though. Don Johnson is far from my favorite actor, but he actually is competent in this role. It's not a great film but it's certainly not as bad as the other reviewer said it was."
1,a boy and his dog,the movie was either copied from a tv set or a movie theater...i have seen this movie several times and even read the book.the pictur was about 3 inches tall(supossedly wide screen?) and the resulation was terrible as was the sound..
4,A fun movie hampered only by a low budget,"The best thing about this film is that Don Johnson spends much of the movie holding conversations with his telepathic dog. The fact that such a premise becomes acceptable and believable from the outset is a testament to the strength of this film. It sounds ludicrous, but watch the movie and see for yourself just how well executed the scenes with Johnson his dog are. The movie is at its best when the two are exchanging banter back and forth, especially in light of the fact that the dog is obviously the smarter of the two. Also the ending will bowl you over, it has to be seen to be believed."
3,"Crockett and Tubs, the Early Years","This is a fun movie for those who don't mind low tech, low-brow fare. Released in 1975, A Boy and His Dog features Don Johnson as Vic, a post-apocalyptic scavenger paired with an intelligent canine named Blood. They communicate telepathically, but really, what's the point? Vic always wants to find women and Albert always wants to find food. That's the theme of the entire story and it motivates Vic to do things he'd never before considered. There are surprise appearances from Jason Robards and Alvy Moore (Hank Kimball from Green Acres.) The movie is well-paced, a little dated, and well worth seeing. Note: The script is based on a book by Harlan Ellison, who apparently hated the last line of the movie."
2,A boy and his dog a waste,"I love good science fiction, but this movie was a dissapointment. The video quality was fine, but the story was not only very depressing, but unrealitic in its assumptions about any future after a world wide nuclear war. The dog was the only really interesting character. The rest was mostly meaningless violence."
5,**Funny Movie**,"This is one of the funniest action movies ever. I laughed every second of the movie. If you like Martin Lawrence, comedy movies, or action movies buy this film. It is one of the funniest movies in a LONG time. BUY IT if you like ANY kind of movie. It will always be one of my personal favorites."
5,A Fusion of Ingenuity and Jocular Scene.,"This is probably THE most harlious movie I have ever seen. The screen writer did a master job at captivating one's attention in this film. Martin Lawrence was at his best and the participating actors were just as successful as he was in amusing their audience. Impregnated with comdey and action, Blue Streak's writers and directors definately accomplished what they had intended; to humour the viewing public.Deliberate omission of parts of the scenes from the film, which I fould most interesting was done in order that I would not spoil the excitement for intended viewers. You must view it for yourself. Do not let anyone tell you about it."
3,It's da bomb,Typical Martin Lawrence style of comedy. Plot: jewel thief needs to retrieve a diamond he stole and left in a building which turned into a police station. He poses as a police officer for one day just to get the diamond back... but that's where things go all whack and the comedy ensues!
5,Funniest movie in the world! Martin is HILARIOUS!!,"This is tied in my opinion as one of the 2 best Martin Lawrence movies (the other being ""Nothing to Lose""). Martin hides a jewel in a building that is under construction when the police arrive at the robbery. After spending 2 years in jail, he returns to the building to find out that a police station has been built there. This movie is about his hilarious quest to impersonate an officer for the LAPD and try and get his jewel back. Coupled with the hilarious Dave Chappelle, this movie is a must for anyone who enjoys Martin Lawrence, the Chappelle Show, Crank Yankers, or anything else that involves either of these characters. Eddie Murphy's replacement has arrived! If you want comedy, get this movie!!! (Don't bother with National Security, all it's good for is a few great catchlines) Blue Streak also has it's fair share of catchlines like ""Belie' Daht"""
4,Easily Martin's Best Solo Effort.,"""Blue Streak"" is Martin's ""Beverly Hills Cop"", just like ""Big Momma's House"" is his ""The Nutty Professor"". So he Rips off Eddie Murphy... Get Over It, he's a funny man. (even though Big Momma was sub-par) Martin Stars as a criminal who stashes a diamond in a construction sight when he gets arrested. On his release he finds the construction sight has been turned into a Police Station.This of course provides the comedian with ample comic fodder and the audience with alot of laughs. The Supporting Cast are Great (Highlights are William Forsythe and Dave Chappelle) and the Action Set Pieces are on Par with any Big Action Film.The Pacing is Perfect so the film never lags, and the direction is spot on. Martin's Pizza Delivery Boy is the Films only weak link as that scene provides no real laughs at all, only Simpathy laughs. That scene is the reason this film gets a 4 instead of a 5. Other than that it's a near perfect Comedy."
5,The Best Movie I Ever Saw,"Martin Lawrence is awesome as the Jewel Thief Miles Logan. this movie has comedy, action, thriller written all over it. it is a great comedy. i never get tired of watching it. i love Martin Lawrence's work. he is hilarious and when him and Tulley get together he is so good. this is my favorite movie."
4,Great movie fast moving and fun!,"My 9 year old son loved this movie so we just bought it on DVD. This movie has lots of action and a great plot. Lots of really funny scenes. The humor can be somewhat adult. The movie is about a guy (martin Lawrence) who steals a diamond then hides it in a building under construction. When he gets out of prision this ex-con goes to collect the loot he stashed only to find the building became a police station. He goes undercover as a cop to find the goods. This movie has all the makings of a good action movie like die hard, james bond, etc. but yet also is a great comedy. Martin Lawrence did a movie last year (big mommas house) that was of a similar type comedy/action genre. This movie was better than big mommas house."
1,A 2nd Tier Eddie Murphy Knock-Off,As Much as I Respect The Talent Of Martin Lawrence why would he be caught doing this Eddie Murphy Reject?So Much Formula it isn't Funny.This Storyline has been done way too many times Already.
1,Rip Off,"There was no dvd in the case when it arrived, even though the packaging had not been tampered with. i want a refund."
4,Excellent fun.,Luke Wilson is so hot. If you ever get the chance to see Bottle Rocket then do so. Martin Lawrence is the king of delivery. Perfect Friday night energy.
3,What did you expect from Martin Lawrenece,"Overall the story is predictable, silly and is exactly what I expected it to be. If Martin ever gets upset because he has been typecast it is his own fault. But I still liked the movie for what it was. As a comedy of this nature, it was on the up and up, just not my genre I guess."
4,An Entertaining Action/Comedy.,"Martin Lawrence(Bad Boys, Nothing To Lose, Life) does give anfuuny and Energetic Performance as a Thief, been in Prison for Two Years, without the police finding it, what he stole. Then, where he Hide his Treasure on a Building, wasn`t Complete yet, For all this time, when was in Prison, The Building was Complete and turn to a Police Station. the Only Way, he could get inside, is to Impersonate a Police Detective to get his Treasure, Now one problem, every time, he want to get his Treasure, they always ask him for his Service and In Tights, The 1996 Remake-The Nutty Professor), William Forsythe(Best Known for Flat Top in Dick Tracy), Nicole Parker(Boogie Nights) and Graham Beckel(Best Known for the Hit T.V. show Becker).DVD`s has an excellent anamorphic Widescreen(1.85:1) Transer and An good Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround. Grade:B+."
1,Spartan,"The word aptly describes the authors cruising style, and unfortunately his writing style. Chris White's ""The Cruising Multihull"" covers all of the same subjects in much greater detail, providing information which will let the reader make his/her own intelligent choices."
1,Bought as gift but after reading decided not to give it.,"Sorry to say, I consider this one of the worst wrote books in my nautical library. Purchased it (used) for a friend, read it first and felt it was so poor I didn't make a gift of it."
4,This just a one year subscription.,"I wish that they would update the software for the Palm T|X. The new versions only run on the Palm phones.You receive the software and an activation code for this.The activation code does not work correctly. You have to contact Handmark by email to get them to do the activation.The product itself is great since it contains all the Zagat guides. But, the product description should make it clear that you are getting a 1 year subscription only."

4,It is still a classic,"Hart and all of his works have a place of their own in history of human warfare. The book covers most of the important battles and wars of all period up to the modern era. The look into the strategic position of each events mark the superior mind of Hart, a Captain who Generals listened to.It's definitely for those who look beyond the tactical geniuses of field-commanders and more on the strategic plane of the conflict. It's a beginner's awe and a bluff's dream, but also a source of original inspiration for old-timers.Buy it before it becomes extinct, not in a long time I hope."
2,Shoes Have Bad Rubber Smell,"Having just received these shoes, I noticed a strong smell emanating from the box. Upon opening that packaging, I was overwhelmed by a smell that seemed like a bicycle inner tube. I have bought other similar shoes online and never experienced anything like this. I only hope the smell dies down over time, as I like the shoes otherwise.BTW, they tend to run a tad large."
1,Smell cannot overcome style and price,"These shoes maybe nicely priced. Returning them because of the atrocious smell that never went away. Also, started to rip in places. Never abused. Stay away!"
2,"Fine for press/drip coffee, not espresso","I bought this coffee grinder because I had heard that burr grinders were good for grinding beans for espresso. Maybe other burr grinders are, but this one is not. It produces perfectly acceptable grinding for use in a french press or a drip coffee maker, but even on the finest grind setting, it comes nowhere near a fine enough grind to make espresso. Also, I have noticed that the grinds are not very uniform in size; on the finest setting there is some finely ground coffee but there are also a lot of larger grounds. I don't notice any obvious improvement in coffee flavor over my whirly-blade grinder. The search for a good coffee grinder goes on."
2,"Style over substance, apparent on unpacking the new unit","I'm in the camp with reviewers whose comments on this product range from slightly disparaging to foaming at the mouth. The hopper is so flimsy that you need to be more careful than I was while extracting it from its packaging prior to first use, unless you also want the cheap plastic to break before you even plug it in.Static is a constant problem (not sure whether this problem is specific to Bodium though).And after less than a month, the machine just stopped working. When I turn the timer, I can hear the mechanical timer rotating, but the gears don't turn. I know the outlet is ok because I had to revert to the old blade grinder. And the timer knob is every bit as flimsy as described.I still prefer the conical burr grinder such as this one is, but I'd probably buy a heftier one next time."
1,After 2 months it doesn't work!,"I'm sorry I bought this online (through this site), as I cannot return it!It worked fine until last week. The motor just whines. I've taken it apart and cleaned it well. It may start initially, but then it stalls again.FYI, I disregarded other negative reviews when I bought this! Don't make my mistake!"
5,Deserves 10 stars,"We have had this grinder for 4 years and have subjected it to torture at least 5 times a day with multiple grinds at each time. We are espresso freaks. It continues to work like new. If a bean is ever jammed you just give it a tap, and vioal! fixed. This is the first grinder we have ever had that lasted more than one year in our house. We have had more than 5 grinders this decade alone! And all were different brands. It is also the first one that we never had to clean up after. The grind, coarse to fine, is accurate and infinite. Can not say enough good or rave enough. Unless you go up to close to $300 you are NOT going to get more of a work horse. The grind is also consistant, no rocks among the sand like with the cuisinart. It also is very very good looking on the counter. The photo does not do it justice."
1,Avoid this unit and manufacturer,"I had mine for 6 months, used maybe twice a week, and it just stopped working. I took it apart, and they use a steel helical gear on the shaft of the motor which meshes with a PLASTIC gear in the gear box. Sure enough, the teeth on the plastic gear were sheared off, creating a dead spot on the gear. Really poor design (all metal gears or a clutch would be better).Bodum doesn't sell parts online, but I'm not into replacing a gear every 6 months. Interestingly, Bodum sells the unit online for less than here. Maybe they are trying to dump them.Avoid this unit at any price, and think carefully about other Bodum products which might share weak engineering."
1,Zero Stars for this Grinder,"Absolutely the worst grinder made... knobs will vibrate off, coffee hopper will never fit correctly, huge static electricity build up so coffee dust will fly out of hopper and create a mess everyplace on the unit, the grinder teeth never grind cleanly there is always a teaspoon of coffee waiting to fall when the hopper is pulled out! DO NOT BUY THIS AT ANY PRICE. Ammazon requires a ""Star"" rating this gets ZERO stars even though they made me post one star."
4,Good deal,"I wasn't expecting much for $50.00, but i like these. I connected them to my Cmoy amp and now have a good portable solution to weak headphones. I wouldn't consider them the best, but for the price, im happy."
2,Terrific...but short lived.,"Alright, when I first got the headphones 4 months ago, I loved them and have ever since. Great sound, absolutely great. But then one evening, the left headphone cut out. I hadn't been using them roughly either. Perhaps a problem with weak components?"
3,broke after 3 month,ear piece broke after 3 months compney to repair but cost 7 dolLar to sHip baCK other wise I love the phones
2,Hot Garbage,"I am a radio dj and also spin on the weekends, and was in need of a good replacement pair for my sony headphones. I saw these in a whole bunch of magazines and websites and ordered them. Cool style, good reviews. These headphones are not good at all. Muddy sound , followed with light distortion if you turn them up to get over crowd noise. I am returning them and would not suggest these headphones to anyone who needs good sound in and outside of the studio."
5,"Finally, the connection has been made.","Although, I am not Italian. I have so many connections, and my ways have been very close to what Raven teaches us of the Old Religion. When I began to read this book, I was worried I would not get through it. As Raven takes us back to the centuries and time of the Craft. However, I told myself in order to understand I needed this history lesson. I am extremely over joyed with doing exactly that. It was very interesting to see the ways of the strega already matched my personal opinion on what position my Altar should be in, the element connections with the tools. It is extremely interesting how Aradia, Diana, and Hecate all are connected in some way and the fact these names keep a close connection with me throughout my walk of this path. - I no longer consider myself a Non-Traditional Witch. I am on my way to learning more and proudly call myself Stregone (male Witch)"
4,For Those Who Want to Venture Beyond Celtic Oriented Witchcraft...,"I read this book and found it to be chalk full of Italian roots of Witchcraft, Aradia, origins leading back to Tuscany, etc.This book is not for beginners, as one can get lost if they do not take the time to really read the chapters.It is filled with quite a bit of historical Italian Witchcraft lore. At times, there is a bit of overkill on the references and it can get confusing.All in all, it is a very good read and I feel every Witch, Wiccan should read this book, if not for the history of another country's Craft traditions and beliefs.We all must try to remember, it does not matter who was first in regard to Wiccan, Witchcraft origans...What is most important is that Witches and their religions were well established for hundereds of years, throughout the world.This book belongs on every Pagan's bookshelf!"
1,Please dont waste your money,"Please, please dont waste your money on this book, yes some parts of italy do have a traditions of folk magic and these are known collectivley as the practice of ""stregoneria"" not ""stregheria"" (the word ""stregheria"" doesnt even exist in the italian language to my knowlege.) not that it matters as no italian folklore practice remotely resembles anything described in this book.What Grimassi presents here is his own brand of Wicca flavoured with the writings of Charles G Leyland.This book is new age tripe, it has nothing to do with italian history or culture and it is offensive to suggest otherwise."
3,"Interesting read, but...","I just can't get over the feeling this author is making some of what he writes up. I think he has a genuine interest and is somewhat educated in this subject, but I feel like it's not enough to fill a book, so he just puts in half-truths and opinions to fill in the blanks. I give it three stars because there are very few books out there on this particular subject (that aren't by this author). Yes, there are Leland's books out there that I still need to try. But in regards to this book I'd like to see something a little more researched. Overall not a bad book, but take it with a grain of salt."
4,Matigari,"Using Christian analogies, the book is is a metaphor for Kenya's - and all African countries' - struggle for freedom and an end to corruption. The fictional title character was so realistic that the Kenyan government issued a warrant for his arrest and banned the book!"
4,More girls with guns good...,"This DVD completes the series with the last 5 OAVs. This time around the stories have a greater feeling of substance. Supporting characters are more fleshed out especially in episodes like ""Revenge of the Muscle Lady"", and ""Sleeping Beauty"" where they draw on the 3WA's past. Madame Beryl appears as a recurring character, as well as ""Q"", an obvious homage to Bond. The weakest episode is probably ""Red Eyes are the Sign of Hell"". Audio and video are still quality stuff for such an old TV program, and the dubbing does the show credit. I was pleased to see the credit-less ending sequence appear on this disk, not the only such duality that makes this a satisfying bookend to the first DVD. Anyone who likes Dirty Pair, especially if they own the first DVD, owe it to himself or herself to complete this fine set."
4,a little stiff,"I don't have any real complaints about the comforter other than the fact that the fabric is kind of stiff - so stiff that it actually scuffs (the color kind of scuffs off) if you scrape something on it. Other than that, for the ten dollars I paid for it I can't complain!!!!"
5,Between Two Worlds: The Art Student and the Warrior,"Academy Award nominee Aaron Weisblatt has crafted a powerful, compelling doc about artist and P-38 ace Fred Arnold and his personal mission to honor the fallen flyboys who were his comrades in WWII. Saw it at a Universal Studios screening where it got a standing ovation and immediately ordered 6 copies of the DVD to share with our parents and several veterans of Arnold's generation. It meant a lot to them. Humanistic, sometimes shocking, very moving and a wonderful tribute to all the young American airmen who volunteered to do battle with the Luftwaffe in 1942 and did not live to tell about it. Weisblatt and Arnold do their story proud.Wendy & Gary Tigerman/Los Angeles"
4,Great tool for your Restaurant!,"The product was easy to install, user friendly and high quality. The range is exceptional and the impact to server efficiency has been awesome! Would highly recommend this to any restaurant owner..."
3,Rumba En El Patio,"Although this is not La Poncena's best album, it is pretty damn good! ""Rumba En El Patio"" with Yolanda Rivera (the Puerto Rican Celia Cruz) on vocals is an explosive salsa number! I mean, this song will really get your bones moving, and is reason enough to buy this album. ""Rumba En El Patio"" has that same spice and energetic tempo as say ""Noche Como Boca 'E Lobo"", ""Tiene Pimienta"" and ""Moreno Soy"" (Energized). ""Omele"" is another danceable hit with Luigi Texidor on vocals! 1977 was a good year!"
5,Brief but brilliant,"What a brilliant little book from Mr Piccirilli. No bullshit - just plain and to the point, filled with interesting anecdotes and poignant advice, this is a must for writers who want/need some inspiration. Highly recommended."
2,Not my favorite,"The yoga section is very slow & monotonous, talking, and feels forced. I only used this DVD for the meditation occasionally, which is also somewhat lacking in presentation."
3,Deserving of comment,This book asks important questions. What is the value of a life with Down syndrome? A sobering account of one young man's murder it makes visible how little we value the lives of those with intellectual disabilities. Paying tribute to Danny's memory it is to be recommended to anyone who cares about life and how we need to maintain strong communities.
5,Warm story that captures your interest from the start.,"Characters that seem real and believable. A story that works out the characters' problems in due course without forcing actions on them. And it was sheer pleasure to read a book set in Ireland that didn't make everyone in it out to be dark, dirty, horrible, mean, or viscious. Too many of such books that I've read - whether fiction or nonfiction - seem to want all of the Irish, especially the clergy and religious, to be nothing but bad news."
5,a beautiful picture of Ireland; not mushy; compelling story,the characters in this story are well-developed. events are well-paced and not rushed but Taylor doesn't include any unnecessary details. one is drawn into the lives of this people in this beautiful Irish village/town without being subjected by sappiness or overemotion.
5,Carla Ann is ONE IN A MILLION!,"Carla's beautiful personality comes through her music! Send Carla's First Christmas CD as a christmas gift to family and friends. My favorite is #3 ""They Followed His Star""."
2,Otter protective case for ipod video,"So, I bought this protective case for my ipod and seems very sturdy. I have not tried it to see if it works when it rains, yet, but don't want to take my chances if that's possible. The downside of the product is that it cannot be used for workouts at the gym which is the only reason why I bought an ipod in the first place. There is no way to reach the hold buttom, and I have to open the case to turn it on and off, and that's becoming a hassle when going to the gym. The other problem is, since I had to leave the ipod without the ""hold"" buttom off after my workout, I can't see wether the ipod is still playing or not and can't see if it has been turned off. The ipod is very sensitive and can turn itself on just by the wheel touching anything (in this case it was the seat or my car). So my ipod got discharged. I think this is a good product but don't recommend it if you use it to go and do your workouts with it indoors."
4,Awesome case!,"I love this case. I only give it 4 stars because it is quite large. However, honestly, I don't care. It is a tough case that will take my clumsiness and protect my ipod. I love it, and will problably get another when the time comes. Though, it may be for a while because this case is really sturdy!"
2,Expected more - Definitely for beginners,"I found this DVD to be entirely too easy. I've been regularly doing pilates and yoga at a studio my entire pregnancy. I'm currently 24 weeks pregnant and did this DVD for the first time today. I would only recommend it to beginners who haven't been exercising during pregnancy. I feel like I could have done the whole DVD two more times before I would get an effective workout for my ability. The Kegels section is okay, but even it was not long enough or difficult enough.The quality of the DVD is average. The background scenery is nice. Sometimes her voice instruction does not line up with what is happening on screen.Overall I would, again, only recommend this DVD to beginners. I don't think I will be getting much use out of this DVD."
3,"ok brief intro, just be aware of the ebook formatting","This is a beginner-level intro to development theories. It's brief, but adequately covers the material. Unfortunately, the ebook version has lost a lot of formatting when it comes to tables and boxes. This makes it a little difficult to read, but the information is there. I read it using Kindle for PC."
4,great book! well-organized!,I had to read this class for a politics class. It was so helpful when I missed lecture and well-organized when I needed to find information quickly. Definitely something I will hang onto for the future.
2,Not for homeschoolers,"The book's layout is geared towards a teacher and a classroom. The book contains overhead projection sheets to display for the class. Most of the book's thickness is the overhead sheets. In class that works, but not at home.The book displays a map each week and asks questions about that map. Unfortunately, the answers are printed by the map. When a child looks at the map, he sees the answers and doesn't learn anything. The book is definitely not for independent homeschool learning, because it's too easy to cheat.The content is good, but it's too easy and very repetitious. My daughter completed the whole book in 3 days. I hoped it would last 36 weeks."
4,A good book to supplement your devotional time,"Few people read from the writings of the early church fathers- either because we don't know where to begin or the translation we have is in archaic English. Either way, it becomes an exercise in frustration. This book solves this problem by selecting short daily devotional readings from a variety of authors and then updating the translation. The readings are short (usually a couple paragraphs) and are helpful in making the most out of your devotional time (it's amazing how little human problems change over the centuries!). As you might expect, some of the readings will speak to you more powerfully than others. But at a minimum, the excerpts reveal the rich tradition of thought that underlies Christianity. It's worth a look!"
1,Is he serious?,"He's advocated for at least 20 candidates - and they've all lost. He's a lefty, so obviously the Mainstream Media is going to give all the credit and air time he can possibly soak up. But his thesis that Americans want Lefty policies but are just too dumb to know it is ridiculous. John Kerry and Al Gore had no positions because if they told us what they believed in they knew they'd lose by even more than they did. This blogging ""phenomena"" is just group therapy for the deluded."
1,Not Based in Fact,"As a former Democrat I have been forced to become an Independent because of the very type of fact-less arguements pawned off in this book and daily by the elite liberal leadership. Fellow libs, we can't take anything back until we start to deal in reality. For starters, how can Armstrong write that Air America is a success - it continuously borrows money to stay on air and lost it's flagship station in NYC - is that success?All in all I found this to be a pretty tough read. Hatred of the current adminstration is not a blueprint for election success. If our leadership could realize this."
1,Save your money,What a complete and utter waste of time. Its obvious how these guys got dubbed the nutroots.
5,A MUST read for Democrats who want their country back,"This book will make even the most loyal Democrats squirm. You'll read about fat cat consultants, single issue zealots, entrenched political operatives, and misfired strategems--an excruciating postmortum of 2004's perfect storm of defeat. Halfway through the book you might just want to give up and move to Costa Rica. But Armstrong and Zuniga spell out a route to success well worth the read. It's not a comfortable trip but you won't be sorry you took it."
5,Clear Vision for the Future,"This book was an excellent and quick read...the authors have analyzed the problems with the Democratic Party and described their suggestions for the future with clarity and purpose. I learned a lot about the inner workings of the Democrats' campaign procedures and I think that Markos and Jerome are on the right track for helping spur people to put the Democrats back in action. I was also intrigued by their analysis of the single-issue groups which don't seem to see the big picture which I think is completely dead-on and can be seen every day (see Sierra Club and LCV support for Lincoln Chafee).Thoroughly enjoyable and more importantly, very hopeful and inspirational. Well done!"
4,Painful but necessary Democratic self-analysis,"For Democrats and unaffiliated progressives, reading this book is initially discouraging. The depths of the problems faced by the party in conducting campaigns and winning elections is daunting, to say the least. However, any positive change in behavior has to follow a recognition of the problem's existence. The dialogue in the party that this book will hopefully spark is long overdue.The trolling reviews by conservatives are amusing and revealing. Why are they interested in a book about Democrats tearing down the current methodology of Democratic political campaigning? If Democratic ideas don't appeal to the public, conservatives have nothing to fear from this book, since it won't make any difference. However, if conservatives are concerned about the lack of appeal of their own ideology, such screeds make a lot more sense."
4,Would get five stars BUT,"This isn't a tome that really attempts to CHANGE America - it simply attempts to bolster the Democratic party....a party whose ""strategy"" to date is to wait around until the GOP self destructs, since it always does when in power, and then takes over by default.Where they miss the boat is twofold;1. They seem to be unable to think outside the box and realize they could help start a viable THIRD PARTY that would get BOTH useless powers-that-be's attention!2. In one part they say that special interests should just go along with Democrats because Democrats will take care of their interests better than Republicans and on the other they suggest that the Democrats shouldn't be all about their interest groups. Which is it?!Fine research, but lousy conclusions."
2,Very unimpressed,"This book says the big problem with the Dems is they have no ideas. OK so far. They point out how the Repubs have put together a vast machine, involving think tanks, training centers, a right wing media, and coordinated messaging. Yup, that's true. They point out that the Dems not only have no ideas, but they run their campaigns in fundamentally wrong ways, such as going to the same few consultants, concentrating on a few states and a few races and not running nationally...dead right.But...in more than 200 pages, I can't find a single idea. Not one. They keep saying that there's hope, that the Democrats can work this out, can become the majority party again. But they don't give a single clue as to the ideas that would lead us there.Don't buy this book. Buy Joe Klein's book. Better read, and what is good in this one is pretty much in that one."
1,Where's the discussion of election fraud?,"Election fraud is the reason Republicans keep winning elections. Plain and simple. There is ample evidence of massive fraud in the 2004 election, but the corporate media didn't (and won't) report it.Don't believe me? Wait until '06, or '08...."
5,"Straight talk, easy read, makes sense","I bought an advance copy of this book because I am an avid reader of dailykos.com. A lot of the stuff that's in the book has been mentioned in entries on dailykos, so I found it familiar but not unpleasant ground. I hope this book gets to the people who need to read it, namely, the DNC leadership."
4,valuable overview,"As long as the Web is available to the public in an egalitarian fashion, the voice of the people will increase in power."
4,Nice counterpoint to professional blowhards,"I am not the biggest fan of either of the author's websites. MyDD puts me to sleep and DailyKos is too screechy.So I did not immediately run out to buy this book when it was released.My mistake.This is a great book for those who are frustrated with the status quo of American politics. I don't believe the netroots alone will save the Republic (and neither do they, I bet) but I believe that the philosophy outlined in this book -- a people-based philosophy -- is a step in the right direction.This is a very quick read, so it's easily worth the purchase or loan."
5,The Internet can really help to build grassroots democracy,"this book is a MUST read for people who want to learn how to get involved in effective advocacy in the public interest. However, we (citizens) must tell the net-promoters that WE want to be in charge of policy formation, goal setting and determining priorities, as well as advocating. Now THAT is true PARTICIPATORY democracy. DON'T be satisfied with just being a grunt in the trenches! And don't BUY participation -- that's part of the problem with democracy today -- money talks...too loudly."
4,Berglund Center for Internet Studies Review by Jeffrey Barlow,"This work is of interest for several reasons. First, the authors' status as practitioners of electronically-enabled political action makes anything they might write worth understanding by those of us concerned with the impact of the Internet. But the intended audience of this book is dissatisfied Democrats. For them, the book is meant to be both a wake-up call and a sort of field manual for recasting their party. For Republicans, at least for those on the right of the party, the book might be read as a satisfying affirmation of their tactics, if not of their goals...While Armstrong and Zuniga give us many examples of successful Internet-enabled political actions, ultimately they leave us with only a vague feeling that the ""Netroots"" are somehow going to be more progressive, and if fully engaged will save not only the Democratic Party, but American democracy as well (see pp 146, 176).For a full review see Interface, Volume 6, Issue 3."
2,Nice but do not fit,"I dont know if i do anything wrong but, after trimming, following the instructions and lines, the body didn't fit in my jato, the hole for the engine is too small, you'll have to use your eye and your instinct."
3,"Good, but save your money....","The same performances are available in a two-CD set, along with the Octet and the Viola Quintet No. 1 - at half the price. Check Amazon."
5,Very captivating,"Was not sure if I would like this because of it being only one person doing the whole show. I was very surprised because Dean Jones did an excellent job in telling John's story and the story of Christ. He did several voices and made you laugh and cry. I definitely recommend this to anyone who loves live stage performances and is interested in finding out more about Christ. This performance really makes you wonder: if you are one of Christ's followers, could you endure the hardships that the apostles went through and still not deny Christ?!"
5,modern day Apostle,"This ""sight and sounds"" type one man show is the best I have ever seen. It is authentic, scriptural and appears to be a totally heartfelt tribute to our Lord.Good show, Dean Jones! Here is another example how God can change lives."
5,Wonderful!,"I cannot think of any errors in with this DVD. There is even a song in it written by Dean Jones! It retraces the life of Jesus through the eyes of St. John. The acting is superb and Dean Jones *becomes* St. John. It does talk about the crucifixions and martyrs at the time, so depending on your standards, it may not be appropriate for young children (they would probably get board anyway). I would highly recommend this to anyone, though, and believe it would be appropriate for any religion who has basis in the Bible."
5,Gospel for all,"This show is a great way to share the gospel with people of any age. The humor is appropriate and the acting is amazing. You would swear that Dean Jones is actually John, the disicple. They don't use confusing words or anything like that. I would suggest all pick up this DVD."
4,Entertaining perspective on John the Apostle,"Dean Jones presents believable portraits of John the Apostle in two parts: I - recollections of Jesus and II - life in exile on Patmos. With few props, the focus is on his acting, which is easy to watch with the exception that he runs out of different ""voices"" for the characters at Jesus' trial, and the crucifixion sequence is a bit long (both scenes at the end of Act I). ACT II (John on Patmos) is definitely ""lighter"" and shorter than ACT I, and a natural way to approach the book of Revelation, especially with those who are unfamiliar with its place in the Bible and/or the Christian message."
1,Play,Did know this was a play . Did not enjoy. Just not what I expected. To long getting to the meat of ther matter.
4,good quality tape,It's not a Hollywood quality film. It's a very good recording of a one man play. keeping that in mind- you won't be disappointed
5,The one-man show.......,"I would like to say that Dean Jones did an outstanding job in this one man play. It was light hearted at times, yet so... deep and moving. You can feel his passion for Christ, you know that it comes from the heart. This is a keeper to add to your Christian Video Collection."
5,Dean Jones has was never better!,"Outstanding one-man performance. Mr. Jones discussed his role in this play at my church back in the late 80's. As I recall, he said the the original script was something like four or six hours long. How he was able to memorize all his lines so perfectly and deliver them in such a real and passionate way is beyond my comprehension. The timeless video has been one of the best evangelistic tools I've every used...once you start watching you can't stop watching until it is over. Truly his strongest and best performance of his life and an inspiration to all who view it. I can not say enough good things about Mr. Jones or this video. Mr. Jones is a man of God whom I've come to respect and love as a brother in Christ...he even prayed for me that evening! God bless you Dean Jones for sticking with your faith in such a godless profession."
5,ABSOLUTLEY OUTSTANDING...A MUST SEE!,"Dean Jones' protrayal of Jesus' deciple John as an old man in exile, is extremely well done. Not only that, I would say it was one of the best performances I have ever seen. I alway's enjoyed Mr. Jones' acting and the movies he has made, so when I saw him interviewed prior to the film being shown on TV, I thought, ""Well, I'll see a little bit of it and then go to bed."" But 90 minutes later, I knew I had to get a copy for myself, for my son, and for my parents. After watching it once again, I loaned it to a friend and she wants to borrow it again to show her Sunday school class. It is now on loan to a man in my office...and all of this in just 2 weeks. I wish there was some way of saying Thank You to Mr. Jones and the company who put it together, but I guess I will just have to tell others.. BUY THIS VIDEO...SHARE THIS VIDEO...IT IS TREMENDOUS.God bless you, Mr. Jones."
5,"Powerful, insightful","St. John in Exile is a powerful message delivered so credibly by Dean Jones. From my impression of him as a lighthearted comedy actor, I was shaken into a new view of the man, portraying one of the most widely known men of the bible. The performance from an artistic view is flawless and showcases a depth of talent the reflects the true abilities of Jones.From a scriptural angle, the performance is is true, with the non-scriptural parts credible as well as highly entertaining."
2,thought it was an actual movie,"didn't realize it was a play with a cast of one. fell asleep on the movie, was an attention grabber."
1,Rip off,"This is not a movie... This is a cheap stage play..! Do not list this as a ""movie"" when it is not !"
2,"Great idea , poor execution","This was a great concept for a book. But it turns into a zany comic novel that never lives up to the concept. Too bad, all film buffs have had dreams about seeing a complete Welles version of the masterpiece The Magnificent Ambersons."
3,reasonably good,"It has good mystery, lots of dead bodies, some sex and travel to exotic places, and movie trivia. But some parts of the story are moving really slowAnd yes, there is one more amusement: a far right-wing Congressman from Massachusetts winning his next term by a landslide. Considering the fact that recently I read about a Republican Senator from Delaware (D.Brown Deception Point) and a conservative governor of Minnesota (J.Sandford Hidden Prey) it seems like there is really a ground swell there."
5,More fun than a page 6 scandal,"You can't beat this thing for sheer entertainment. I won't recap the plot or cast the movie (except to offer Jack Black as the hero, NOT Ben Stiller) and say only that if you like guys like Donald Westlake, you'll laugh all the way through Cutting Room. Klavan's book is funny, sharp, smart and spares few overblown egos as it races to its finish. I hope Roy Milano gets employed again, I had a great time following him."
4,Creativity vs. noise,"The book's argumentations are not as thoroughly developed as ""Abuse of Language Abuse of Power"", ""The Virtues of the Human Heart"", or ""Leisure the Basis of Culture"" but all three of these books' ideas are touched on. I don't even recommend it as a Pieper introduction, ""In Defense of Philosophy"" is better for that; the narrow confines of his point making here may discourage a reader from pursuing Pieper's ideas further. Pieper was making the argument that we lack a true appreciation of the roots of ideas coming from the Western/Christian tradition and Pieper wishes to set people right and further correct the wrongs in the direction society has often taken. He points at the destructive noise of society of commercialism, sloganism, society not understanding the contemplative spirit of our tradition. Being creative is a good possible cure Pieper notes, seeing beyond what the eyes see and into the soul or spirit, although he places a caveat on this and defines a correct approach."
3,Good movie / poor transmission,"Enjoyed the movie but experienced problems throughout the film such has delays and freeze ups. This was unusual, generally no viewing issues."
2,Just watch the Documentary,"I did not like this movie at all. It was too long, the acting wasn't very good and it was boring at times. To me it was a recreation of the documentary which is pointless to redo. The only reason I didn't give this 1 star is because the background story, in the beginning of the film, got my attention. If I'm going to sit for 2 hours and watch a movie about Woodstock I'd rather just watch the real thing via the documentary."
3,Solid Solid 3 stars...very entertaining movie,"Anybody who was alive during Woodstock and knows the music and the stories willbe happy to see this movie which point to related stories around the festival.We all know there was these little town that most people did'nt mind seeing allthese hippies coming through their town, and that were the magic begun...as theinvasion became a sea of people, music and happiness.This movie captures the feeling with good acting from all. I applaud Eugene Levy'sfor the great actor he is...even after those american pie movie, when he acts,his character becomes truly believable."
5,What a Treat for Woodstock Fans!,"I happened to recently find this movie on my On Demand cable service. I had not ever heard of it.I'm a HUGE fan of 1969 WOODSTOCK, (have Collector's Edition of DVD). I have always felt I was born in the wrong era--I should have been there! (To me, there is really only ONE REAL Woodstock.)I knew some of the facts in the movie Taking Woodstock, but it was AWESOME to see it put together and done so WELL!I love the portrayal of Elliot, whom I perceived as the main character. I saw this as also a ""coming of age"" film, from his point of view. He was amazingly brilliant at such a young age and to make such excellent ""business/promotion"" decisions that had to be made under pressure.It is *totally* a ""feel good"" movie. I thoroughly enjoyed it and would love to own the DVD!I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT!In my opinion, the best review here on Amazon about the movie is by James Lossing (it should be the top review) so be sure to read it!"
4,great!,"Really makes you understand more like you was really there! So I guess, this is the closest I can feel to really being there. I am not sure about some of the things though, they could be made up to excite the younger generation, not sure. But when I saw a doc on Woodstock, I was shocked when it was describing thing that happened in this movie & felt like ""yea, I remember"" I wasn't even born back then.;)"
5,Most Underated Film of the Year,"Taking Woodstock is one of the most underated films of the year.the texture, the composition, the entire film is amazing.it captures the essence of the period perfectly.I loved the film. I believe, you will too, with an open heart."
2,A disappointment,"The director certainly tries his best to capture the feeling of the Woodstock phenomenon / festival from a periphery. The film is well shot. However, the script examines the phenomenon through the lens of a money-driven family and major events through their son who is coming to grips with a whole bunch of non-Woodstock related events. Homosexuality, interpersonal relationships, career etc. ZZZZZZZZZZZZ. Personally, I could care less what this uninspired actor/comic does. Liev Schreiber is one of the few actors in the film who keeps you from turning off the whole thing. In short - there was nothing of Woodstock in there to hang your floppy hat on. No sequences of musicians, no staged behind-the-scene sequences. Nothing, other than a drug-induced scene in a van where there is some Woodstock music played against a dreamscape of LSD inspired visions. Slap in some nudity, some tie-dye, some eccentric people and call it movie."
3,Woodstock Screening,"I saw this movie here in Woodstock with Ang Lee, James Shamus and Michael Lang in the audience. It's a small movie from the perspective of Elliot Tiber, a minor player in the overall saga of Woodstock but definitely worth seeing.Listen to RADIO WOODSTOCK 69 with music from the original Woodstock era. Watch Woodstock TV. Join our Woodstock online community.[...].Peace, love, music,RFWoodstock[...]."
4,Sometimes it helps to have a lawyer,"...This is not a book about playwriting, nor is it that much help to a playwright who is trying to get his/her work noticed. Yes, there is a section about marketing and promotion, but the writer here is a lawyer and this book is strongest when it deals directly with the many legal quandries a playwright can get into. I have already consulted it numerous times in regards to copyright issues and what were my rights going into a production. That said, I do find it curious that, while she has a large section dealing with various legal issues between a director and a playwright, she has left out entirely any discussion of problems a playwright may have with Actors Equity. How could, for example, future productions be encumbered if you allow an Equity production to go forward? That question wasn't answered, but many others were and for that I find this book to be invaluable."
1,It's who you know,"I'm sure this is a very nice book, just like the Writer's Market books about agents and publishers. The problem with these books is that unless you have a close personal friend in the publishing business or the theatre world, you will never get anything published or produced. No book can help you do that. It's a matter of luck and coincidence, and if you weren't lucky enough to go to college with someone in the business, you're out in the cold, and no book will alter that fact for you. Have a nice day."
3,"Hmm, this is Manga??","Ok, not to sound to critical, but this is supposed to be an adaption from the Zoids series... it follows the storyline better than the NC0 one, and Ban is much cuter in this one, but there needed to be stricter adherance to the original storyline...But those are my thoughts, otherwise it is fantastic!CW: I liked it, but it is far more fun killing off Van..Maelgwyn: Please leave my poor Ban alone, CW or Ill cook you up with any flames I get, muse. *groans* Why cant I get anther"
3,Worth having as a piece of Karate history only....,"Karate Do Nyumon was Gichin Funakoshi's book for beginners and introduced us to the little practiced Ten No Kata. Ten No Kata is a fantastic tool for teaching fundamentals and introducing beginners to rehearsed kumite. As it is practised on the spot it takes up very little room and can be practised anywhere.As far as the book goes, that's pretty much it. All of the stories and background can be found in Karate Do Kyohan which is a far superior work and the stories of Azato and Itosu are repeated in virtually all Funakoshi's work. The techniques displayed in the photographs are for me being a Shotokan karateka, shockingly poor and I shudder at the thought of a complete novice having this book and thinking that what he/she was looking at was good form.However, this is Funakoshi's text and being a complete karate geek the book, for, me is worth having as a piece of Karate's history only."
5,"Hypnotic language, engaging fiction","Bandler does a wonderful job at circular, enigmatic, and yet satisfying fiction. He does an even better job at showing beautiful uses of hypnotic language and hypnotic metaphors. The entire book is also a wonderful hypnotic cure for ennui, both by being entertaining and by being a powerful set of hypnotic suggestions for exactly that purpose.A beautiful demonstration of Ericksonian principles wrapped into a package any child (any almost any adult) will love; in that respect, the book is a little like Grimm's Fairy Tales."
5,Not for the critic,"This book is written like a fairy tale. Adults may have to let go of their preconceptions in order to enjoy this one. If you read this book, I suggest you use your imagination, and just be prepared to let Richard take you where he will...I have read pieces of this book to friends, and they have all zoned out and enjoyed it."
3,Memories of London,"Douglas House provides the reader with an insightful look at Navy life in London in the 60's as seen through the eyes of a young African American man. Thrust into a foreign country, the book's hero struggles with finding his identity and comfort level. For those who were in London during that time, the book is a poignant waltz down memory lane."
5,Sandra Bullock is amazing!,I had seen her in Miss Congeniality a million times and she still got it.In this movie you can see her talent surface.So if you are a computer maniac and like what you see in Miss Congeniality then I advise you to take a look at the net. You won't regret it!
4,THE NET,"This is an interesting story, for me, since I have been writing computer code since 1959. ( I also find Sandra Bullock 'interesting' ) The story line of an individual losing their identity through computer hacking is REAL. The movie story is a good tutorial for people who would like to protect themselves from computer crime."
5,The Net is the one of the coolest movies I've ever seen!,The Net is an awesome movie! It is a suspense. I would recommend it to anyone!
5,The Net is A Cyberthrill Worth Watching!,"When I first saw The Net I was a lot younger and really didn't understand it. But now that I have seen it again I beleive that it is on of 1995's best thrillers. It is an up-beat action movie that is so good it'll keep you on the edge of your chair and your heart beating fast! The series is nothing compared to this movie. I have seen this movie over 20 time, it is just one of those movies that you can watch over and over again and never get tired of. If you haven't seen it yet I reccoment that you do!"
1,what a waste.,The movie wasn't good and the disc they sent didnt even work. It would cost me more to send it back than the actual movie cost. NOT worth the money.
4,Did you see the HUGE cell phones?,"I love Sandra Bullock, so of course to me this movie is worth watching just to see her act. But I also liked the movie based on the suspense. But having said that, did you see the huge cell phones back in 1995? I forgot how big they were. It just shocked me to see how advanced technology got in 10/15 years. I love it."
4,The Net - The Movie,"True to what some may say, ""The Net"" does tend to drift off in direction, but I LOVE this movie for two reasons:1.) I am a HUGE Sandra Bullock fan2.) The Macintosh - The dominating computer used in this movie(insert Apple logo here...option, shift, and K keys)"
4,ummmmmmmm.........,I love this film and had play the vedio quite a few times since I first watched it. It's fast paced and an interesting story.
2,Painful cliches abound,"Normally I would never admit that I watched this movie. I do so only to issue a warning: if you value your brain, do not watch this!The plot is a series of cliches and illogical events. The ""bad guys"" are mind-numbingly stupid.If it appears on television, watch something else. If someone offers to sell it to you, run far, far away..."
5,Great Movie-Liked the Commentaries,Loved the movie. Also liked the discussion on how the movie was made and what they wanted it to be.
5,Excellent Film,"I, like most of the reviewers here, seem to find myself worrying about realism in computer movies. This movie was different. It didn't take long to find myself getting lost in the movie and forgetting about the technological 'failures'. Sandra was great at demonstrating the fear of someone getting into your files (as a manager at a comms firm, that IS a REAL fear!). The only bit that was REALLY over the top was the 'melting screen' when a virus is infecting a computer in the film but that will be for effect as there is really NO OTHER WAY that I can think of to suggest a virus to the non-computer people (and we all know QUITE how many of them there are!). All in all, a great film"
3,Teckies who do not mind some unrealism in movies,"Though not as fascinating or intriguing as ""Hackers"", the Net is still a good hacker/cracker movie. For newbies at the internet, the show introduces some common net lingo like ""IRL (In Real Life)"". For netizens, the movie does highlight many security pitfalls like backdoors, sniffers and trapdoors despite being over simplistic as to how these security pitfalls can exist.On the whole, an enjoyable movie if you love techno-brain-ticklers, Sandra Bullock and Macs!"
2,could have been better,"i ordered this to show my son about how technology works. everything was fine until about 40 min into it where all the gliches were. i expect some, but not too many where if i didnt see the movie before i wouldnt understand it. it could have been better quality. i had to fill my son in on the missing parts. however, i will see what the seller will do about the return process. if its ok, then i will just get another one. if not, i probably wont buy form this seller anymore.. depends. then again, anyone can make a mistake. we'll see......"
3,The tv-show was better,"I remember when I saw this movie the first time I loved it, but ever since I saw the tv-show, this movie isn't much...I wish they just would release the tv-show on DVD, so I could watch it again..."
5,BEST FILM ON THE WORLD,SANDRA IS VERY NICE PEOPLE AND SHE IS BEATUFUL. SHE IS THE BEST MOVIE STAR NOW! I'M FROM FINLAND AND MY ONLY HOPE IS ATT I MEET SOMEDAY HER!
2,Average.Com,this film should have been more interesting considering the subject of the net but it gets stuck in Junk Mail cliches and never recovers.Sandra Bullock never could act and follows the Pattern here.a good idea gone frozen.
1,Broken dvd case,When I recieved this dvd I opened it up and the dvd was rolling around inside the case because the middle part that was supposed to have held it in was broken. The dvd was scratched up and when I read the return policy of course it said I can't return opened dvds so I'm stuck with it. Great movie though.
2,not worth it,"This is one of those movies that they show on late night TV, just to fill the slots. And you could watch if you can't sleep. Otherwise it is not even worth renting, let alone buying. I am sorry to say this because I think very highly of Jeremy Northam and I think Sandra Bullock is a decent actress. But the story is so weak and full of cliches that even they can't carry the movie. My view is that the conspiracies just bordered on the absurd. There is a sign on the screen and you see all this secret information when you click on it -- give me a break! And they could have taken her out so many times during the movie and yet they didn't. Please. The plot was just too weak and full of holes."
1,I HAVE NO CHANCE TO WATCH THIS DVD THOUGH I HAVE IT !,"I have bought this DVD relesed by Tristar-Columbia with regional Coded 3 (in Asia), I am using my TOSHIBA DVD PLAYER SD-2100 (regional Coded 3 machine) to watch this movie, but unfortunately, there is no picture appeared on the screen at all! Is there any problem with Tristar-Columbia released DVD working on the TOSHIBA SD-2100 machine?"
1,DVD,I ordered The Net with Sandra Bullock (1995)and they sent me a sci-fi double feature dvd which isn't what I ordered from (2007).
2,Visionary film,"This movie came out quite a while ago, when the ""popular"" internet was still in its infancy (or toddler years). It portrayed scenarios which at the time seemed ludicrous and far-fetched. However, in 2010, identity theft is all too real since the 'net is connected to everything. I did not particularly enjoy this movie (just can't dig Sandra Bullock), but I will give the film-makers credit for their foresight."
5,A Fun Captivating Movie; One of Sandra's Best,"The Net is a great movie. Keep in mind that this movie was made in 1995, which is the Dark Ages of the internet. No, it is not the most technically accurate movie, but it is not suppose to be. It's a movie. One may classify it as sci-fi, and what is GOOD sci-fi... something based on reality, but stretches scientific reality a little and asks ""What if this were to happen?""I think Sandra does a wonderful job in this movie. Within a relatively short period of time, you genuinely feel for Sandra's character and are concerned for her.This is wonderful movie, with a captivating plot, solid acting, good direction, and is just plan fun to watch.And by the way, Enemy of the State came out 3-4 years after The Net... and while I liked Enemy, I love The Net. Another good movie in this arena is No Way Out... Check it out."
4,"Even after 11 years, still a film worth watching.","I remember watching this film 10 years ago on video, and thinking that it was an exciting rollercoaster ride. the film mainly works thanks to the credibility of the sandra bullock character, she comes through as vulnerable, yet smart and she pulls you into the paranoia, suspense , and action of the plot. And the film still works today because as in the film, we've become a society completely dependant over computers and we can empathize with the fear of becoming victims to technology."
5,Computers & Suspense,"I had been familiar with this movie having seen it some years ago. I enjoyed it from four aspects: it is about use of computers, it is full of suspense, the plot is well constructed and riveting and I like Sandra Bullock's portrayal of the prime role.I knew what I was buying and have not been disappointed."
1,Get what you pay for,This is not a Brother item. The ad ends with By Brother and it's not true. It's a cheap generic and bad knock off. Like another person stated - it prints streaks down the page and is worthless for any nice kind of quality job. I don't buy the generic ink because I've had trouble and should not have purchased this. What a waste.
4,drum for brother HL 2040,"The drum seems to fit correctly and the printer is working well. However, the drum warning light that indicated I needed to replace the drum continues to flash. I suspect that is because it is not a Brother product."
5,Worked like a charm!,"We saved a ton of money purchasing the ""compatible"" drum... and it solved our drum errors and everything is working fine again. Thanks!"
3,Where's the Stripes? Not much new but mildly entertaining,"This is kind of an odd documentary - it's about one of the most famous bands in the world (who seem pretty chatty) but includes only interviews with people who know them or `know someone who knows them.' Well, any way to make a buck.As an avid fan I still like the DVD. There are a couple of tidbits to learn and it's interesting to see how the entire phenomenon rose up in Detroit. Decent effort but I'd try to rent it first."
2,Not what I was expecting,"If you are looking for a dvd that is filled with White Stripes music and interviews, look elsewhere. The item description says it has over 40 minutes of in-depth interviews, but it fails to mention that only about 10 minutes (if that) of this is actually with the band (and the 10 minutes are scattered throughout the 65 minute dvd). It has interviews with members of various bands that have played with the White Stripes in the past and others who knew them when they were just beginning. It is mildly interesting to hear about how the band got their start and other such details, but it is not something I will watch again. (If Jack & Meg were telling their own story, THAT would be worth it)."
3,"Square Dancing Past, Present and Future","This is a well done, 13 minute copy of an old video. It is delightful to see the age range of dancers swinging their partners - from 7 to 70! I was only disappointed that it did not actually contain the ""history"" of square dancing as the title implies. It would be better to say, ""Historic Square Dance Film.""Nevertheless, with modern entertainment sources so expensive, and the economy no longer supporting those sources for most people, I believe (and hope) that we will be seeing a resurgence of interest in Square Dancing as a way for people to have fun, excercise, and interact with one another without having to spend their rent money!I recommend this heart warming little DVD to anyone who would like to go down memory lane or perhaps even show this current generation what fun being ""ladies and gentlemen"" can actually be!Squaredance Fundamentals"
1,PLEASE don't read this book!,"This book is firmly entrenched in 1930's archaeological theory. Ross uses Irish and Classical texts inacurately and then presents them as fact! This book has been reviled by the acedemic community, and rightfully so. DO NOT read this book if you want to learn anything about the 'real' Celts."
3,quite nice,"The book tell the story of two brothers, how they come to go away from home and follow their dream to own a tram. It tells of events, decisions and coincidences that have an impact on the course of their lives, and it gives you a glimpse of life in the thirties.The book tells its story in a very tranquil, not too emotional, way, so it won't make you laugh, it won't make you cry, it may make you think ""yes, that's the way of life, sometimes"". It was not boring to read the book, but it wasn't very interesting either. Yes, quite nice..."
3,"""This is the story of my brother Duncan""","This book just sort of happened to be on the bookshelf with the other unread books. Something one of us must have picked up at some point or other from somewhere or other, and I just sort of happened to be in between two heavy books, so decided to give myself a break and read something a bit lighter. It was a lovely little ditty, enjoyable to read, although at times a touch technical for me, enjoyable because the young people in it expected good and found it, sometimes in the most unexpected quarters. The characters, affable and uncomplicated,find themselves in comical situations throughout. An enjoyable, relaxing read."
5,A smart little lifeline of a book!,"Dave Williams' ""Sin Boldly"" ought to be required reading in colleges today. It's not the dry, ponderous grammar rulebook so common to dry, ponderous English lectures; ""Sin Boldly"" cuts to the heart of writing by describing effective thinking: how to plot an argument, logical pitfalls, and reasoning on paper. In addition, it includes engaging rules of grammar, asking some of those tricky ""Is it this way, or that?"" questions. It's a quick read, a handy reference, and an indispensable tool for ""acing the college paper!"""
2,Meh,"Slow to start, weak ending. The middle is a bit hard to put down when there's action, and I found myself gritting my teeth trying to get through totally inane ""Which boy should I be kissing?"" type conversations to get to the good parts. The book could have easily been cut down at least 50 pages, and would have benefited greatly from it. ""Tomorrow When The War Began"" is not a terrible book, but it's not great either. If the blurb interested you, I would recommend ""The Hunger Games"" over this book any day. If you read this, I would suggest checking it out from a library instead of paying money for a copy."
3,"Tommorow, When the war began",The book was very adventrorus from the begining to the end. I think the story had a point of friends sticking together through thick and thin when the war started they went out and tried to help. So I thought the book was a great read.
2,Didn't make me want to buy the next one,"Red Dawn it ain't. Not a bad book, but not one I couldn't put down. In fact, it was often tough to pick up.Maybe it was the teen-aged girl perspective. I just could not get into it.Maybe it was the Aussie perspective. They didn't seem to care that their country was just invaded. In fact, they seemed to blame their western way of life for causing it.Maybe it was the lack of a villain. They, whoever ""they"" were (never identified, and no curiosity whatsoever as to who ""they"" were), were certainly never identified as the bad guys.I feel sorry for a society that thinks so little of itself that they have to force themselves to defend it. This liberal disease seems to be infecting the entire English-speaking world. It would be a shame if it wasn't so sickening."
4,"Tomorrow, When the War Began","Ellie and six of her friends decide to take a camping trip together in the bush of Australia. They have a great time while they are gone from the responsibilities of their families. On the day of their return, things are seriously wrong. Every one is gone; their country has been invaded. Important decisions are made as lives are taken and plans are made. And in the midst of all this chaos, love is born.This book kept me ""on my toes"" throughout the entire plot. The action was well planned out. The characters were intelligently created. I seriously recommend anyone in the ""young adult"" catagory to give this book a shot. The plot was amazing and the action packed events were the cherry on top of it all. Beware, the book will keep you anticipating what will happen next. John Marsden has created a very intense book that is highly entertaining."
5,Taking me back to my childhood,I was a teenager when the Tomorrow series became a huge seller. To read this book again really makes me want to get the whole series. Novel's audience is teenagers but great for those wanting to reminisce.
5,"compelling read, warning to parents of preteens","My 13 year old daughter and I have both read and enjoyed this book. I agree with many of the reviews below. I would like to put a word of caution out to parents of preteens, the second book in the series gets a little more sexually explicit than I would want. The violence is also a bit more personal than in the first book. I will let my daughter read it, but not without some discussion. Another very good read out of Australia that we both enjoyed was ""Looking for Alibrandi"" by Melina Marchetta. Check this one out, good romance, good plot, good decisions. Enjoy."
5,Fantastic !,"One of the best books I've ever read! This book is fantastic! When Ellie and her friends go bush, they come back to find that their country has been invaded. They fight back against the unknown enemy, and... I wont tell you, it'll spoil the book! I'm searching our school library every day so I can read ""The Night is for Hunting"" and I can't wait until the seventh and final book comes out later this year. If you read ""Tomorow, When the War Began"" you won't be disappointed! I also strongly suggest that you read the next five which are out. I think my favourites are ""Tomorrow When the War Began""(1), "" The Third Day, the Frost""(A Killing Frost)(3), and ""Burning For Revenge""(5) These are all awesome books. Read them!"
5,great book,this is a great book and the movie is great to. a book for all ages and anyone wo loves a good aussie writer. 5 stars!
5,Story that stands out?,"Tomorrow when the war began is a refreshingly original story about teenagers coping a great loss: the loss of their country and freedom. The way the writer describes the changes the main characters go through is very vivid.I'm one that likes reading books that stand out for one reason or the other and this without a doubt in my mind is one off them.If there is one slightly negative thing about this book than perhaps it is that it seems ""girly"" from time to time. Ofcourse, since the main character is female this was to be expected. However I wonder if it is really needed to discuss how well certain prisoners are hung or how confusing exactly Ellie's love life is.Having said that, even this is part of the whole package and this package is entertaining, easy to read and easy to relate to."
5,"i bought the books, and everyone else read them","These 3 books were the best i'd ever read, when i bought them, not only did i read them but so did my friends, family, and relatives, the books just tempt you to read them, and when you get into it no-one can put them down"
5,Took me on an adventure ill never forget,"The tommorrow series took me on an adventure ill never forget, The whole series took me three months to finish and it was the best three months ive had in my life because of how real the characters were, it was like you were with them throughout the book and was there in the mix of the danger. It was an end of an era when I finished them but I know ill forget what happens and will be able to start the adventure all over again. These books allow you to go through an adventure of years through a war and through the roughs of trying to survive, and at the end you feel like part of your life is gone. It literally changed me. And i didnt even need to leave my bedroom to have the adventure and friends of a lifetime."
4,Not Marsden's best...,"Since everyone else is giving this a 5 I thought I'd add my 2c. If this had been the only John Marsden book I'd read I would probably call it the best book ever, but while it was a great read I didn't think it had the impact of some of his other books. After reading Dear Miffy I could think about nothing else for days on end - Tomorrow didn't really have that effect. If you thought this was great then check out some of his other stuff. Right now I'm reading The Dead of Night which is much better IMO. Still average Marsden is better than most writers at their best.Like someone else said, parents should read this before handing it to their kids."
5,"Tomorrow, When the War Began","I absolutly adored this series of books, and this book in particular. The first of a series of seven, this book is a perfect gift for any age, 13-99. This book is about a brave teenager who, with the help of her friends, changes the outcome of a nation. John Marsden shows high respect for teens and provides creative solutions for seemingly impossible situations. If you liked Ella Enchanted, The Golden Compass, or Dealing With Dragons, you will love this book!"
5,The best book ever!,"I''m yet to meet a person who doesn't adore this series. John Marsden is one of the greatest Australian authors, and this series has made a legend out of him. If you haven't read the Tomorrow series, you ought to! You will find that it changes you forever, literally. Once you've read the first line of the first book, you'll know what I'm talking about! Read it!"
5,John Marsden is a seventeen year old girl in disguise,"John Marsden can not possibly be a man and get it so right with a book about teenagers, especially from a girls point of view. There are guys that have read this book and liked it - hopefully they're taking notes on what we're thinking. I haven't read for a while, but I love Jon Marsden and I plan to read the whole series. Some of the things he says ring true, definitly. The coolest thing is that, at this point in time, the ending hasn't even be decided yet."
5,"I'm not a reader, but enjoyed this.","The last book I read was The Road, after watching the movie. It took me 6 months to read that. This book, it was good. I read it in a week. Its way better than the movie."
2,very sloww beginning,"I have been asked to review, cant say too much at the moment but I find the whole of Chapter 1 boring and very slow, I hope the book picks up, or I shall not bother reading the whole book. Will let you know if it starts to pick up"
2,Fooled me,"All the reviews seem to be good for this story. Watch out! There is a caveat. It's written for children, not adults. The characters of this novel are teens. That's OK, except they ruin the story because of their normal behavior. They can't drive a car very well, they think about sex immaturely and usually at inappropriate times, they know very little about how things work, their feelings are always hurt, sleep is a big deal as is eating, and they don't know about guns or warfare. So if you want to read about a group of clowns saving the Aussies, dive in. Two stars from an adult."
3,Red Dawn ReDone,"This is a good start for the 7-book series. It was well-paced and held my interest.Written in the 3rd person, it conveyed just enough facts to keep me turning pages."
5,Astounding!!!,"The story is believable and engaging, its characters depicted with startling clarity and honesty. A must read for all! Don't miss this gem"
5,best book-ever,Having read many other john marsden books I liked thisone the best because it had a good mixture of exitementand build up to the excitement. I also liked the way thebook was honest and more realistic than his other booksand any age could read it and still enjoy the book
5,Amazingly AWESOME!,"This book is VERY good. In the beginning, I didn't think that I would like it, and usually I just LOVE books. But once I had a chance to go further into it, I just COULDN'T put it down! It's really amazing. You have to read this book. Around the middle, I was really excited about the way things lead to another. In your imagination, you can only guess what's going to happen next, and it's never really what you thought it was going to be."
5,Ten stars!,"This was the first John Marsden book I read, about six months ago, and since then, I have read all of his books at the school and city library at least twice, the war books at least five times! If that isn't a compliment, I don't know what is! Read them all; I'm getting the new books the second they come out in New Zealand, long before they do in the U.S.A!"
1,Trash Metal DVD,"This DVD is not even worth the 10 bucks that I had to pay for it.The audio quality is bad, the camera shots are bad. The music videos are dumb and not what I wanted. The only reason I purchased this dvd is to see what Music videos were on it. I am a collector of music videos (Promos). I've been looking for DVD quality copies of the good Nuclear Assault songs. I didn't think they would be on this DVD but I wasn't sure.All in all you gotta be a really really really hardcore Nuclear Assault fan to like this DVD. I like Nuclear Assault but this dvd is no good at all. If you know where to get DVD quality version of Critical Mass let me know."
1,Too hard to read,The book is yellowed with age and impossible to read. I think it is hard to read because the print is so small and the pages are very yellow.
2,Disappointing,Bad translation of a mediocre and sappy history. I couldn't stand it and have gone looking for a different biography of Catherine the Great.
5,Great book of a women who knew what she wanted,"The daughter of a minor German prince, it almost easy to imagine Catherine the Great came to the throne by accident. But Catherine had a mission. Almost from the day she was chosen to be the wife of Grand Duke Peter, Catherine set her sights on greater power. She suceeded, some say by murdering her own husband, Tsar Peter III.Catherine lead the Russians in the battle for the Crimea, eventually winning the region for the empire. The book also goes extensively into the many loves of Catherine. But short of using them to define who the Tsarina was, Troyat treats them as the diversion that Catherine saw them as.Catherine saw herself as a liberal monarch. In fact, she regularly corresponded with Volraire and Diderot. But in the end, Catherine's main accomplishment was the maintain the power of the monarchy."
3,The Skinny on the Catherine,"A masterly work borrowing heavily from Catherine the Great's own memoirs, Troyat's biography delves deeply into the politics and personal strife surrounding Russia's most famous and most licentious Empress. We found that this book best deflected the occasional Puritanical sensibilties that hamper a story and went straight for the dirt, when necessary. Were other biographers too red-faced to admit Catherine died in the bathroom? Believe it! [HistoryHouse.com]"
5,Easily her best ever,"Rebecca St. James has spent most of the past four years enjoying her success of ""Wait For Me"" with a book, greatest hits album etc...I have to admit I wondered what her next release would be like. Did she get lazy or was the extra time spent making her next album going to make it better than ever? The answer is easily: it's better than ever.Each song on this cd is stout and solid and ready to be enjoyed. I can't pick out a favorite as each song I thoroughly enjoy. This cd will make a great gift for every Christian music fan on your Christmas shopping list as well as a great gift for a birthday and a great gift for yourself. I can't imagine anyone not enjoying this cd! I plan on getting this cd for people on my Christmas list as I know they'll enjoy it. I'm going to buy it from my local Christian bookstore however as I want to support local Christian organizations."
5,Just What I was hoping for!,"This may be Rebecca's best album yet, making it well worth the long wait. Musically and lyrically it is totally solid. With tracks like ""God Help Me"", ""Alive"", ""You Are Loved"", and ""Beautiful Stranger"", Rebecca comes storming out the gate with catchy, melodic rock tracks reminiscent of her ""God"" album. Softer tracks like the ballad ""I Need You"", and ""Lest I Forget"" balance out the mix. To me the only minor miscue is ""Thank You"", as the chorus is a little too repetitive. No matter, this album is more than worth the price, get it!!"
5,Eclectic sounds sprinkled into rock,This album draws its unique sound from many different styles creating an array of delectable rock sounds that cannot be found elsewhere. Rebecca's fantastic voice and great lyrics top it off to make an enjoyable album that can appeal to almost any rock taste.
5,Excellent!,"I was blessed to recieve a pre-release copy of this cd from the label to review: Boy, is it great!I was disappointed that Alive was the first single: I didn't really like it. I liked You Are Loved, Shadowlands and I Need You quite a bit. I think this cd has alot of character, and a few of the tracks have cross-over potential. Let's hope the label markets this thing just right: It may be Rebecca's last chance to go mainstream, and she deserves more than any other CCM artist to hit it big!"
3,Compact but very low volume,It works but the volume is way too low to be heard when inside a running vehicle. I like the style and size but speakers were not adaptable to what I wanted to use them for.
4,good deal for the money,"I got these speakers to add the ability to share sound with another person while using a portable dvd player or an mp3 player. They are completely dependant on the amount of volume produced by the device so they can be a little quiet if the device doesn't put out a lot of volume. On the other hand, they work, don't require batteries, fold up to a small size and do the job. I worry a little that the cord that plugs into the devices may get pinched since it fits in a groove on the outside of the case, but then a retractable cord would have increased the price and possibly the weight of the speakers. If you need substantially volume, you will need to get powered speakers.All in all, though these are a good buy for the money."
3,Too quiet to be very useful,"The compactness of these speakers is very nice. It's also nice that they don't require batteries. Unfortunately, this prevents them from being very loud. I was hoping to use them while bicycling, but they're completely inaudible in that environment. The chord is also very short, which helps with the mobility of the speakers (the chord folds into the speakers for transport), but makes them impractical for many purposes.If you just want some portable speakers to use on a table or desk near you, these are a good buy. The sound quality isn't great, but it's decent. If you plan on using the speakers in a car or outside environment, look elsewhere to a battery-powered unit."
2,had it for a year then broke,"its better to buy qualityeverytime i buy cheaper Ikea ect and this product i regret my purchaseworked good for a year but the cheap plastic brokeim going to buy stainless this time...buy quality over price is my new motto or dont buy at allfor some reason i think european product = quality but nope, shop aroundi do like the shape though considering my limited counter space"
2,Defective base switch is a problem,"While this is a great kettle while it lasts, you never know how long that will be. Keep your receipt! The base contact switch is of inferior construction and fails. A quick search on the internet will show that many people have had problems. Mine lasted one year for a product that has a two year warranty. I spoke to Bodum and they know there is a continuing problem with the switch. Since this problem has been around since at least 2002, it is Amazing that Bodum hasn't asked STRIX (maker of the # P69 switch) for a different switch for the kettle. So, be prepared to return the Kettle under warranty or use it until it fails and purchase another one. With a better switch, this would be a 5 star product."
1,Burned out after 6 months,"I replaced it with a Melitta Express Kettle, also 1.7 Litres, which seems to have a nicer balance, and definitely a better base arrangement, since the connector is in the middle and you can put the kettle down on it in any orientation. Seems to boil faster, too, but that may be illusory."
1,Works until the connector melts,"We bought the Bodum 5500 in July 2009 to replace an identical Bodum we had had for at least 5 years before the plastic around the base connector began to melt. The replacement kettle only lasted until April 2011 before the plastic melted on the base connector. We had gotten rid of the old kettle for safety reasons, even though the kettle still worked. The replacement kettle stopped working completely shortly after we noticed the melted plastic.It seems that this kettle. and probably all the other kettles currently available, are made in China, and they are only made to last the length of the one-year warranty.Very disappointing."
3,Good performance but doesn't last,"This pot stopped working less than a year after I bought it. I wouldn't buy another one, even though it performed well during the time it worked."
3,Short useful life,"Worked well, but didn't last that long. My wife & I believe that it quit in less than a year. Given how quickly time passes we acknowledge that it might have lasted longer but we are certain it didn't make 18 months."
5,Great Every Day,This thing is a workhorse... I use it every day. Mine's been going strong for over five years now. I just wish they'd bring back the translucent colors. I love being able to see at a glance whether the kettle has water in it or not. With the current opaque black or white models that's not possible.
2,"These things work well, but not for long",I've got a box full of these that have been returned to our store because they burn out. The problem seems to come when the kettle is used multiple times without a cool down period. The switch internals melt down leaving you with a dead pot.
4,You get what you pay for.,"I work in a specialty kitchen store, so I see many different products and have to know the pros and cons of each. When I was first shopping for an electrice tea kettle I didn't want this one because the heating element is exposed to the water (my roommate had a similar kettle and with time deposits start to form on the element. Looks very gross, but Bodum supplies you with instructions on how to clean.)After looking around for awhile, I decided to purchase this machine (in the black) because the size was good, considering I am the only person using it, and it fits well on my desk. I figure I can keep the heating element clean for the most part, but at $20 I can't really complain. It heats the water fast and has a nice design. The cord is a bit of a pain for me, since I'm keeping it on my desk that has about 400 other cords around it, but if you're just leaving it on your kitchen counter it shouldn't be too much of a problem."
2,"Good, for a short time.","Product lasted for about 20 months before the kettle's connector to the base failed (shorted and the plastic mount melted!). On inspecting it, I suspect repeated removal/replacement of the kettle portion results in a bent or weakened connection and shorting. Still a nice kettle for a $1.50/month ;-)"
1,Very Expensive watch!,This watch was sell by Amazon by $209.00 two months ago.They increase the price only because you are buying it!There are a better options at lower price.Dont't buy it until the sell it at real prices!
3,Great...but you can get cheaper.,"I have a Canon 2010 printer. I don't use it that much, and the ink will dry over time while IN the printer. So I usually only get about 10 color prints out of these ink tanks...So I usually buy the Nectron Compatible InkJet Cartridge, it's cheaper, and it functions the same. But there's nothing wrong with this...other then the fact that it slowly dries out."
1,Not even the eye candy could spice it up.,"This movie is more of a comedy than a horror. Beyond the attractive qualities of the young leads, there was not much to enjoy about this flick. Even good actors like Diane Ladd and Sean Patrick Flanery give poor performances. The only thing that made this movie worth viewing (in my opinion) was the vocal stylings of Mr Flanery (yes, I watched the credits and was really him singing)."
3,Another angels and demon movie.,"This is an ok movie. Adequate but nothing too exciting. I only got it because of Michael Pare` who is ,as usual, quite fine in his part. The story line is another ""cult"" theme where the bad guys are collecting people for nefarious reasons... not a bad movie for a dark rainy evening."
3,"Good, but not very mathematical","This is an excellent textbook for beginners, giving a clear picture of what neural networks are, and where they are used. It also talks about back-propagation, associative neural nets, and more. But the biggest flaw is that the book has little mathematics. And it also doesnt have any working code (only pseudo-code). So if you are considering buying this as a textbook for a NN course you are taking at your university, well, I would suggest you take a good look at the book at your library before you decide to buy it. Most university courses put neural nets on a firm mathematical footing and might also have course projects that have to be done by the student. This book can help you with neither of these. And the book's pretty expensive, I really wonder why."
2,Not very good. Atleast not for beginners,This book requires the reader to know lots of stuff in math like partial diff equations etc. Maybe good for mathematicians and comp scientists but certainly not for beginners.
3,"Tsk, Tsk",This book was a little too predictable and frusterating. I didn't like it how Ayla and Jondalar were always assuming the opposite of what the other person was thinking. I think Ayla was a little too talented.
2,Not the same quality as Cave Bear or Valley of Horses,"I read ""Mammoth Hunters"" after ""Clan of Cave Bear"" and ""The Valley of the Horses"" hoping to get something similar, but I just found in ""Mammoth Hunters"" some kind of love & jellousy novel running in prehistoric times. This book is not as fresh, as precedents, it is not as interesting as precedents and it is not as good as precedents. Characters of both ""lovers"" are not well design, character of Ayla becomes soft and, so to say, wishy-washy, rhythm becomes slow and imagination falls to none. Before reading ""Mammoth Hunters"" I bought ""Plains of Passage"", after reading it I have not found courage enough to read ""PoP""."
2,This is a yawner,"This whole book seems like filler that Jean M. Auel inflicted on us just because she decided this series should have six books in it before she started the series. The main plot line isn't that great; Ayla is torn between sex partners. Oh wow! The book is over flowing with boring sex scenes -- if I wanted this much sex in a book, I think I know where to look for something like that, but it wouldn't ever be anything by Jean M. Auel."
2,The land of Painted cCaves by Jean Auel,"I waited all these long years for this final book. I was disappointed. Didn't feel it was up to the previous. Too much repition, had a hard time staying focused."
2,The most painful book I have ever read,"I just finished reading this book and am so insanely frustrated that I had to spend 400+ pages reading about a misunderstanding. The fact that I continued to read it anyway is a credit to the two characters that Auel has created that I enjoy so much. However, while there were moments of this book that captured some of the brilliance of her first book (which I think is a phenomenal read...absolutely a classic), the vast majority of it is a painful, heart wrenching soap opera. If I had known what was going to ensue, I would not have chosen to experience it."
1,Two words: Bo Ring,"The breeze you feel is me opening the draw marked ""Should Have Stopped While Ahead"" and throwing this book in it. Please, don't consider another in the series, Ms. Auel. You've made me ashamed to admit I liked ""Clan of the Cavebear"" in literary circles. That hurts!"
1,A promising series turns into a ludicrous soap opera.,"Ayla and Jondalar, those prehistoric Edisons, invent the sewing needle, domesticate a wolf and make passionate love in their new temporary home. Of course, in true soap-opera fashion, Ayla falls for another man, thereby making Jondalar wild with jealousy, so much so that in one particular scene he all but rapes her (what a mature response). Naturally, this convinces her that he loves her and at the end of the novel, she walks out on the man she is supposed to marry (leaves him at the prehistoric version of the altar) and runs after her one and only love. Although I didn't like the plot, I did like Ayla as a character and this book pretty much ruined her. Of course, the book takes after 'The Valley of Horses' in its copious sex scenes, which make you wonder if these are necessary for the book to sell. They probably are"
4,How many more masterpieces can one person write?!!,Another riveting piece of work from an author obviously dedicated to 'teaching by entertainment'. I have read all the books in this series and have enjoyed every single one. Ayla is an example to all women. If this the girl power of the stoneage then ROCK-ON!!!
1,about ten times as long as it needs to be,"if this is how people related than we as a species have come a long way. the problems between ayla and jondolar are valid but could have been solved (and are) in one conversation. the whoel book is waiting for them to talk, which doesn't need any of the plot to happen."
2,amusing entertainment for nursing a child by,"I've read the series once already and picked them up again as part of a batch of trashy novels I indulge in now and then. They are amusing, and Ayla and Jondalar are heros of the type to inspire. They make me wish I was a hunter/gatherer and could hang out with the hunky Jondalar. The ""love triangle"" between Jondalar, Ayla and Ranec was so tedious though. That part could have been done away with easily.Sure I'll read the fourth and fifth of the series, but I'm a really fast reader, and they are amusing."
3,Good Story.,"I am re-reading the series for the third time. I love her books.I do agree with the review that said there are too many explicit sex scenes. I prefer a little mystery. That being said, the story is good and Ayla is still true to her nature.Why I only gave it three stars: Major editing needs to be done on this kindle book! Simple things like ""conies"" instead of ""comes"". It's very distracting to the story."
2,Mammoth hunters,"This book is disappointing. Very wordy and repetitious of the other books in the series. The story line is good of Ayla and Jondular, but not much of that story line in the book. I would estimate that I skimmed over half of the book, just to wordy to me. Will not buy the remaining books."
5,Earth's children,"Earth's children is, definitively, the best books series ever! I've read it and loooooved, now i'm reading again and loving even more!"
3,HO Hum,"I REALLY got bored with the discriptions of his blue eyes, exceptionally large man hood, her moist pinkness at least twice in every chapter. It was as though you could hear the editor saying ""You gotta throw a sex scene in here"". Ms. Auel seems to repeat herself a lot in all her books as though the reader has just dropped in and has not read the last page. Most of the books are rather far fetched (except for the location and artifact discriptions) and some of it is down right wrong. (ie. wet leather does not dry out from your body heat overnight). If you take her books as 98% pure fantasy and wishfull thinking they are OK."
3,That's more like it,"After VOH, I was worried when I saw how long the book was. Luckily, this one moves much faster. What I liked: the pace, the new characters, and, yes, I liked the dreaded triangle. After all, it would just be weird if Jondalar was the only guy ayla was ever attracted to. Only problem was that I liked Ranec better, even though you're supposed to root for the J-man.What I didn't like: Too much repetitive description! I like the herbal lore, but after the first few times discussing the uses of willow bark, foxglove, and datura, I think I got it. Also, this is the book where Ayla begins to become very unbelievably perfect. She does everything but create world peace and invent tupperware."
2,Compared with it's predacessors - very mediocre,"Most reviewers agree that Clan of the Cave Bear - and to a lesser extent, Valley of the Horses - are masterpieces. Fun, engaging, luxurious in their premise, polemics and details. Mammoth Hunters degerates into a soap-opera-ish love-triangle that becomes tiresome rather quickly - and then down-right annoying. For diehard fans of the first two installations of the Earth's Children series - don't expect the wonder and depth... but being addicts, you won't be able to resist - and will probably be disappointed."
2,Disappointed,"I am re-reading the series in preparation for the finale. I think I will lightly skim the last half of this one. Auel falls in love wirh her own words as so many authors do around book numer 3. The love triangle is just too much to bare - way too much graphic sex. Also, way too much perfect Ayla. As I remember it the rest of the series is better so I will continue. If they don't get better, I'm not buying the last one."
5,The Mammoth Hunters by Jean M Auel,I COULD NOT PUT IT DOWN AND MY WIFE WANTED TO READ IT AFTER I FINISHED.
3,Ayla's story is going downhill,"Auel's writing was entertaining enough to keep me interested throughout two thirds of the book. Then I got bored and skip-read the rest, suspecting that the ""fateful decision"" announced in the inside cover (of the hardcover edition) would be something very predictable, namely Ayla and Jon settling their petty squabble, having sex, and riding off into the sunset on Whinny, their (not quite white) horse.The book was a nice easy read for a rainy Sunday, though, and it didn't annoy me too much, so I'm giving it three stars."
4,"Still compelling, but weaker than its predecessors....","The author does a wonderful job of portraying the complexity of human relationships, but the story is beginning to seem a little too unbelievable. It's very well written, and still enormously entertaining, but Auel's talent seems to have waned slightly in the telling of this portion of the epic tale."
1,Not worth reading,Most of the book is about a big argument between Ayla and Jondalar. I found this very unplesant to read. I kept trying to slog through the argument part because I liked the first 2 books but I am giving up on this book 300 pages into it. I don't recomend this book.
2,Prehistory as Studio 54,"This is a silly book. Nothing like a series to expose the banality of the writer's soul, I guess. But it is fun to see Paleolithic society portrayed as an evening at Studio 54. Both social systems are defunct. Coincidence? I think not.Ayla will no doubt invent the wheel in the next book. I'm sorry she ever started. Someone invented written language and Auel is threatening to finish the series. Oh, I hope not."
5,Very very good,"The book is great. It will keep you alert all along, waiting for Ayla's final choice- The black, charming man or The tall, bright-haired man, Jondalar? Again, the story is fascinating and great."
4,"Great read, but a little slow","I though this book was great. It explored history and had deep symbolc meaning. Some passages were a little slow and the sex scenes were a bit unessessary, but the rest of the book was interesting, as all of Auel's books have been."
2,The Dead Horse Beaters - A Radical Manifesto,"Book 3 of the EC Series and the author has a time tested character, milieu, and style. By this book, however, the formula is wearing thin even, apparently, for the author. No longer satisfied with spinning a good yarn, in Mammoth Hunters the author abandons both the pretext of pure fiction and subtlety of delivery. The story takes a distant back seat to moral soapbox and is now merely a weak medium by which to promote the author's social, political, and economic views.While no literature stands completely divorced from the convictions of the author, few outside of political tracts and religious parables so brazenly and unapologetically beat the reader about the head and neck. Mammoth Hunters is a heavy-handed exercise in the author's literary self-indulgence.Love it or hate it, your appreciation of this book with probably depend more on your social and political leanings than on your enjoyment of the first two books."
5,Another Auel classic,"Jean M. Auel is my favorite author and as far as I've seen she's only written for this one series. Who cares, it's an awesome series! If your familiar with her books don't bother reading reviews I'll tell you right now from Clan of the Cave Bear, to Valley of Horses, to The Mammoth Hunters, to The Plains of Passage, to The Shelters of Stone, to the new book The Land Of Painted Caves, they are all awesome and need to be read. I hope she writes many more books for this series because I will never get tired of reading (and re-reading) about Ayla! I just wish she would write them faster. When I started this series the first four were out in the Library and I was in grade school. Her 6th one just came out and I'm 32.Just buy them! Buy them all! And everyone demand more!"
4,Fascinating and Frustrating,"What a wonderful book! The Ayla, Jondalar, Ranec triangle was intense. The emotions and feelings gained from reading were amazing. Reading the book or series opens up a new way of thinking, and understanding. I find myself wondering why some of the customs of these people would be taboo today. It is really regrettable that people feel they must hide and disguise the wonders of sexuality in our world today."
5,A wonderful continuation of the saga of Ayla and Jondular,I'm only wondering when we will be able to know the rest
4,Ayla continues her journey,Jean Auel spellbinds you into Ayla's young developing world. Love this book and can't wait to read the next book in the series.
3,"Mammoth ""Misunderstanding""","As a huge fan of ""The Clan of the Cave Bear"" and ""The Valley of the Horses"" I eagerly dove into ""The Mammoth Hunters"". Parts of this book are fantastic and parts are frustrating.Rydag is a gem of a character and his journey is touching. His existence, I feel, is what moves this novel forward as Ayla learns to accept the fact that she must let her own son, Durc, go. I loved this story line!Ayla, Jondalar, and Ranec, however, stumble through one of the most frustrating plot lines I've encountered. By the time this love triangle is resolved I've stopped caring about both Jondalar and Ranec. Neither one of them deserves Ayla and both are Neandrathals when it comes to love (apologies to the Geico Caveman!) I really, really wanted Jondalar to kill Ranec or vice-versa. Either way.All in all, this book is still a good read. When I was done I knew that Ayla was moving on to bigger and better things. I will gladly join her on her next adventure."
5,"great read, grabs you and keeps you enthralled","I had a hard time rereading this book, because of memories of the emotional anguish I felt the first time. It really captures your heart, and your mind. I cried the first time, and the second time I wanted to hurry through the parts that I knew were coming up and would make me cry. After reading this book my emotions would be influenced for hours afterward. If the book made me sad, I would be sad afterwards and needed to be comforted. There are few books that can do this to me, and it really shows the power of the story Auel has built up. I highly recommend it."
5,Wonderful 3rd book,"By the time most authors have hit the third book based on the same story, their steam has run out as does the story. But ""The Mammoth Hunters"" is so real and believable, while maintaining the incredibly original storyline that I must give it five stars."
1,I weep at the lost potential for this series,"I really loved ""Clan of the Cave Bear"", and I thought this series was going to be something special. Instead, the sequels have displayed the most abysmal lack of imagination that you can fine. It's a (badly-written) Harlequin Romance in bear skins."
1,series progressively getting worse,"I read the Clan of the Cave Bear for a project in school and thoroughly enjoyed the entire book. I decided that I would read the entire series. The Valley of Horses was a good book but the chapters I enjoyed dealt mainly with Jondalar and his brother Thonolan, not Ayla. I pushed on to The Mammoth Hunters and decided to stop reading the series here. This book basically bored me to death. As in the other mostly negative reviews I have the same beefs: too much sex, Ayla can do no wrong, and things are repeated far too often. Props go out to anyone who finishes this series."
1,Ridiculous quality on Kindle version,"I am re-reading the Earth's Children series in anticipation on the new book in March. Aside from being very irritated that all but one of the series is available on Kindle in the US (what is that?) I have to comment on the awful quality. I could have typed each of these books over into a pdf and sent it to my Kindle with fewer errors. If I hadn't already read the series and known the characters, I would have been unable to get through it because of the distracting errors (I think ""and"" is typed ""arid"" every other line of the book - especially distracting in a novel describing an environment!)I loved this series the first time through and am VERY upset that using my Kindle to re-read them has detracted from the experience."
2,Low point in the series... so far.,"I know, I know, Clan of the Cave Bear was fantastic, and Auel is a great writer... BUT, this book nearly ended the series for me. I simply could not believe how trashy and juvenile the plot was: a prehistoric love triangle... how exciting. And whatever happened to Ayla's strong, independent nature? Watching her chasing along behind the jerky Jondalar literally made my skin crawl. I wished I'd skipped this book and gone right to the next which was, thankfully, a little better."
4,Great 30 yr adventure.,"Jean Auel has really taken us for a ride. Thru the caveman's world, with the understanding it takes to create a story accurate to the science.The book was received timley and in good shape."
4,A great read!,"The Mammoth Hunters is a great read... I loved the problems that Ayla and Jondalar faced throughout the whole book. It was a stupid problem that could easily have been solved, but that would have made the book kinda dull. The only thing I can say bad about this saga is the overwhelming detail of every landscape, maybe some people enjoy that but i can't stand reading a page on the plantlife, i usually skipped through that because they didn't seem to relate to much to the story. Over all a good book, sometimes painful to read how poorly Jondalar reacts to the problem, but if you liked the series so far read this one too."
2,Easily the most boring entry in the series,"While the other books involve some fascinating action, in this one Ayla and her improbably handsome, impossibly boring boyfriend Jondalar settle down with some nice Mamutoi and learn about peace, love, and acceptance. And sex.Most of the plot is Ayla Sleeps with Hunky Blond Guy, Ayla Sleeps with Hunky Black Guy, Ayla Rescues Yet Another Animal, Ayla Teaches People To Be Tolerant of Differences.Yuck. At least the anthropological detail is interesting. Now I'll know how to skin a mammoth, next time I get lost in the prehistoric wilderness.I did enjoy it, but not that much."
2,Enough already,"This book makes me want to take a shower. Not a cold one. A cleansing one. With lye soap. Where graphic sex was somehow appropriate in the ""Valley of Horses"" because it was Ayla's initiation into her own sexuality, it is so overboard here that you just turn the page, and if you don't do that, then you can predict exactly how many paragraphs it will take for who to do what to whom and by what point on the page someone will be overtaken by earth-shattering bliss. We've known Ayla for three books now, but Jondalar's character degenerates into nothing but a Dirk Diggler stud and he really comes across as not too smart. As if that's not bad enough, if Ayla and Jondalar aren't keeping you and everyone else in Mammoth Cave up all night tossing and turning with disgust, then Ayla's affair with Ranec won't give you a break either. Auel has done her characters a real disservice by reducing them to people who become so paralyzed by sexual pleasure that they can't do anything else until finished."
3,A disappointment,"This book is definitly the worst of the series in my opinion. I absolutely loved the series, but this one was just like a pre-historic soap opera. There were some good parts in the story. I loved Auel's description of the Mamutoi's reactions to her horses and when Alya brings home a wolf pup. But the whole story was mostly just about the Alya, Jondalar, and Ranec love triangle. It's an ok book if you like that kind of thing, but if not you don't even really need to read it to understand the 4th book (which was a TON better)."
2,not for school libraries...,"i first read this book when i was 13. my parents wouldn't allow me to have pornography, but that's okay, i had the mammoth hunters :-)~ i was really interested in the primitive culture, but quickly realised there was nothing primitive about it - ayla and company could easily fit in our 20th century world. by the end of the book i expected ayla to be mastering calculus and fashioning bronze tools - clearly such a gifted girl should be the head of a matriachal society."
3,Better than book 2,"I liked getting to know the Mammoth Hunters..but Auelhas lost much of the ""magic"" that made Cave Bear so wonderful...the interesting characters and the feeling of deep understanding of aculture are missing..I fell in live with Creb and Brun and Iza...yet I barely feel much for even Ayla after these lasttwo books.."
2,Bad Kindle edition,"As many others said, I found the love triangle tedious and it wasn't almost painful to read about some of Jondalar's reactions to seeing Ayla anywhere near Ranec. But my main complaint was that the Kindle edition was ridiculously full of typos to where there was at one almost every page. I think it's just wrong to charge somebody money for something they didn't even bother to spell check."
2,The story loses its way,"I LOVED Books 1 and 2. This one begins nicely, and holds much promise, but the presentation of one of the main characters (Jondalar) deteriorates so much that it then becomes difficult to enjoy the decent portrayal of many other characters in the book. Plus the plot concerning their relationship deteriorates and is poorly treated, then hastily patched together. It is as if the main story about Ayla was so prodigious a task that the author could not properly interweave the subplot of her love interests. Very unsatisfying."
5,earths children series,I started reading these books when I was 13 years old They are what got me interested in books. I am now 30 and i still read these books waitng for the next one can not wait !
4,It keeps the saga of Ayla alive,"It looks like many reviewers thought ""The Mammoth Hunters"" was like a stonge age ""Young and Restless"" soap opera. Or worse, soft porn. In many ways it was, with the triangle of Ayla-Jondolar-Ranec. But let's face it, would this series have ever gotten to a third book if all Jean wrote about was the day to day struggle of hunting and staying alive? Of course not! If the somewhat erotic passages bother you, just skip over them, you won't loose anything from the rest of the novel.As for the novel itself Ms Auel's fertile imagination continues to shine. Her description of the great mammoth hunt is completely beleivable, and for all we know completely accurate as well. Who's to say? Like all novels it has its peaks and valleys. However the peaks are high and the valleys are shallow. This one is the second best book of the series after ""Clan of the Cave Bear"", and definetly worth having."
5,GIVE IT A TRY!,"Everyone should try this series. All of the books in it are excellent and informative. I came across the first in the series, ""Clan of the Cave bear"" by pure accident. I loved it and bought the rest of the series. EXCELLENT SERIES!!! However, I have noticed children of 10 and eleven have read it. This is not something for young children due to some sexual content. Although it is done in great taste, I, a mother of two, don't think that is appropriate. For young adults and over, this series is truely fantastic. Even if you don't think you would like it, TRY IT!! I usually don't go for these types of stories, but I truely loved it. Excellently written to captivate the reader. An early man love story, but so much more. Adventure, danger, excitement, romance, survival, IT'S ALL IN THIS BOOK."
1,A HUGE disappointment...,"I've really enjoyed the first two books in the series. 'The Clan of the Cave Bear' was pretty good - it's idea was original, it was very well written, and the main character was very easy to identify with. I've read 'The Valley of the Horses' mainly because I was wondering how Ayla was doing after being banned from the Clan... I think that this book was trying to show the ""Others'"" reaction to Ayla - some would like her instantly, some would grow to like her... Jean Auel just doesn't manage to give this story a life of its own, and it remains flat and 2 dimensional - all the people's reactions were to be expected from what I gathered about the others in 'The Valley of Horses'.Some other reader described the love triangle of this book as 'soap opera-ish'. I couldn't agree more - this part of the story is as bad as the rest..."
5,A must have for any Nickelback fan,"The only bad thing with this DVD was that it didn't have more songs on it. But the choice of songs and the film that accompanied it was worth it. All my favourite songs were on this DVD with my favourite song ""Someday"".It's a must for any fan of this young new group in the alternative rock scene. Bring it on Nickelback."
5,"If you need a mixer, this is the one!!","I have had mine for twenty-three years without a days worth of trouble. Unless you go to a commercial size mixer this is the best. And KitchenAid makes most of the commercial ones, too."
5,This book is facinating. I could not put it down!,"This book is exceptional in the clarity of the author's thinking. It not only forces the reader to confront the myths surrounding the Kosovo situation but also invites one to apply the writer's perceptiveness and logic to the myths prevailing in the reader's country, wherever he or she may live. The author's personal encounters with the people of Kosovo add a poignancy to her analysis that is all the more compelling in light of the current happenings there. I could not put it down until I finished it."
5,Balanced and Thought Provoking,"While living in Kosovo, I read several books to try to understand the current situation. Most are relatively dry historical accounts which don't seem to adequately explain the tensions. Mertus has a unique approach which uses first hand reactions of both Serbs and Albanians to certain events in the 80s and 90s. From these accounts, you see how each group can view the same events with different eyes and use events to fan flames of hatred against the other side. It is clear how the tension developed to boiling point in the 90s. It also helped me to understand the riots of March 2004. The book is easy to read and does not require previous knowledge of the region. I would recommend it as the key book for anyone with dealings in Kosovo. Mertus ends the book with recommendations for NGOs working for reconciliation in Kosovo."
2,I do not like it,"I have original perfume, this one is not not even closed to original smell. I use it but just as something else not Climat."
3,Climat by Lancome for Women Deodorants And Antiperspirants,"Unfortunately, it is not Climat smell I remember.I use it anyway, it is not bad.But if you want real Climat smell, you should not buy it."
4,Love Climat by Lancome,I have liked the fragrance Climat for a long time; how fun to try it in a daily deodorant spray. Wish Climat was available in U.S.
4,A Very Intense Journey,"I found Randall Sullivan through his Rolling Stone article on the death of the rapper. It was long and very deft, in weaving disparate story elements and many facts. I admired his skill.In The Miracle Detective, he demonstrates the same skill in organizing and telling a complex story in a compelling way. In this instance, it is the story of contemporoary Catholic miracles. For those of us with Catholic sensibilities, this book carries great force - both the realities of faith and of the Church. I found The Miracle Detective strongly moving."
3,Engrossing,"The Miracle Detective was recommended to me by a professor.A true story of a skeptic who becomes a believer, Randall Sullivan describes his encounters with seers of modern-day Marian apparitions.He becomes personally involved while investigating various visions of Our Lady and comes to believe in her miraculous interventions.Although Catholic and very devoted to Mary, somehow Sullivan nearly lost me in the end.I read this book last summer and have a hard time recalling the details."
2,Long meandering book,"The reviews on this book made me purchase it, however I found it long, meandering, and difficult to wade through. The author or the publisher needed to edit this book to half it size and then it would have accomplished what it was trying to say in a readable manner.This book, by an initially agnostic journalist, is an exploration of the appartions that are supposed to be of Mary. For those who are not very clear on the Church's stand on these phenomena, it can be quite eye-opening to realize that the Church dismisses many of them and has a very cautious response to the more famous ones.This is a book that could be borrowed from a library, but definitely not a keeper."
4,Pretty good,Pretty good. Interesting read. Would recommend to others. Has some interesting details. Worth a look. I didnt read whole book but what i did read was quite interesting.
3,Connections,"Are there freemasons in the vatican? So the author would have us believe. This and much other interesting information, mostly about Mary's aparations in Bosnia are included in this book. Like other reviewers, I found the book a little wordy, duplicative, and poorly edited. But, if you are willing to take the time and effort to read it, I beleive there were nuggets of interesting ""facts."""
1,Not about 'detective' work at all,I'm over halfway through and am tired of Medjugorje. There has been no detective work and very little explanation of the process miracles undergo to be officially recognized as miracles. This book should be called 'My Obsession with Medjugorje' or just 'Medjugorje'. I'm not sure why Sullivan felt the need to deceive. Surely the holy mother would not approve.
4,Very good,"This is a very good book. a bit drawn out in parts, but worth it if you are into the hostory of the Catholic Church."
2,Needs Editing,"This books starts out with real promise. Investiagting journalist who looks into a local Marian miracle ends up going to the Vatican and to Medjugorje, Bosnia.There in Medjugorje he undergoes something of a conversion, meeting some of the visionaries and the saintly priest Fr Slavko.However, the book descends into the mess of the authors life and the book becomes something of a self therapy session.As if that weren't bad enough, he moves on from Medjugorje and looks at less authentic visions such as Scotsdale USA: lumping all these things together takes away from what should have been the thrust of the book: Medjugorje and the Vatican.So in the end I wish that the book had been edited and cleaned up. I wouldn't reccomend this book to someone who is wanting to look at Medjugorje: for that, read a real professional investigative journalist's work, 'Spark from Heaven: the Mystery of the Madonna of Medjugorje' by Mary Craig."
3,"Beautiful Towels, BUT . . . .","The towels are very pretty but they are fading fast. I used vinegar in the rince the first time they were washed. But, they continue to fade with each washing and the darkest one already ""looks"" faded. So, if you are going to ""use"" these, I don't recommend them. However, if you want to hang them up to look nice, look nice they will."
3,Wasn't as happy with these as others,"I've purchased some of their other towels, like the fruits for a couple dollars more, and I don't like these as well. They are very weave-y feeling, but don't hold their shape real well, so they don't really look nice after a while. They dry fairly well and I guess if you're just looking for a towel to dry, these would fit the bill. I embroider on them and give them as gifts, so I'm looking for a really nice looking towel that looks rich and would make a nice, expensive looking gift. These aren't those. The colors are VERY deep, a little too bright for my taste, and the towels are a little smaller than some of the others I've used in the same price range. I think, for the price, these are a nice kitchen towel to use, but not nice enough to display."
4,Very Good Product,I gave these as a gift to my mother and she loves them. This is a very good product for the price.
2,Sorry- Old information,"This book, originally published in 1976 is just to dated I.M.O. for anybody looking to cruise the caribbean. I must admit I don't know of any other book that covers all of the carribean the way this one does, but I would rather spend my money on more up to date guides. Would I buy again? NO."
5,Highly recommended to all students of Middle East history,"The Journey Of The Lost Boys by Joan Hecht is the incredible but true story of thousands of young men and their family's who struggled against all odds to seek refuge from the their homeland's war and the death it was certain to bring them at the hands of their oppressors. Readers will learn of a time in which the natives of Sudan were witness to slaughter, disease, and hunger ridden death of friends and family as their journey took them a strenuous thousand miles from their homes to the nearest refugee encampment. The Journey Of The Lost Boys is very highly recommended to all students of Middle East history, International Studies, as well as non-specialist general readers interested in discovering one the many hardships historically significant in the development and shaping of modern Africa."
5,Amazing,"This was one of the best books that i have ever read. It was heart renching at times, yet made me laugh at ohters. The best word to describe this book is phenomenal. I would recommend it to anyone with the warning that it will make you cry, and want to do something to help these incredible men. This book is amazing that it is actually a true story. It's truley breath- taking at times."
2,A good term paper,"The endless conflict in Sudan is another calamity that the press should have been bombarding us with daily for years. A tragedy of such dimensions should torment our collective conscience. This is exactly why it deserves a better telling than Ms. Hecht is able to offer us. The writing is amateurish and the text cries out for the editing it appears not to have been subjected to. Easy streamlining and the correction of some grammatical errors would make the book more readable and more powerful. Ms. Hecht's devotion to the cause of the Lost Boys is clearly sincere and praiseworthy, however, and she does deserve thanks for contributing to making us aware of the atrocities that go on in the world while we turn the other way."
4,Great headset on all accounts,"Great on several fronts:- Comfortable on your ear- Lightweight- Great sound quality- Great battery lifeThe only reason I took one star off is the headset produces a slight cracking sound if it is not in direct line of sight of the phone, but I think most headsets do this."
5,MX51 gives 151% - terrific sound!,"My iRiver last year came with headphones like these. I loved them!Then the cord got cut. Called iRiver; they no longer have such, but told me to check for Sennheiser online products. Amazon had the best price. So happy to have these ""back"" again... missed the deep solid sound so much!! I tried Sony, and ipod and everyone else while I searched.These are the best. especially for $25... not like that $50 others I bought. Thanks to them and thanks to you. I will buy another now...just in case you stop selling them, But, please dont!!"
3,"Sound good, but....","1) carrying case is completely useless and unnecessary. They should do away with it completely and lower the price.2) the headphones can't handle the I-pod. On certain tracks. the I-pod overdrives the headphones causing it to 'pop'. It seems you need to lower the volume to a rather low setting to prevent this. Sennheiser's PX-100, which I consider the very best portable headphone on the market, doesn't 'pop' at all on the same tracks.3) these don't stay in the ears very well.On a positive note, they are well made and do offer pretty good sound quality."
1,Plastic coating disintegrated within a week,"Within a day of use I noticed one or two cuts in the plastic coating, exposing the wires within. By the third day I noticed a third cut. Most curious. So anyway I spent some time taping these cuts/exposures. But over the next few days another 5 or 6 more cuts appeared. Today (7 days after I first opened the package) I got so annoyed that I stopped using it. The sound is still working perfectly fine but I doubt it will last much longer what with extended stretches of the wire exposed."
2,a painful experience,"These earphones were a real pain in the...ear. While the sound quality was pretty good (surprisingly full bass for buds), i.e. definitely better than the stock white buds that come with your ipod, they were simply too uncomfortable to use. After purchasing a pair of Sennheiser HD-555 (HIGHLY recommend), I've come to associate Sennheiser with not just superb quality but putting serious thought into form and comfort as well. The MX51 was a serious letdown. With the foam pads, the buds fit...ok at best, (a little bit too snug for me), but the sound quality is much better with the pads. Unfortunately the foam pads fall off very easily and I lost them within a couple weeks. Without the foam pads, the buds dig into my ear, particularly the black rubber/plastic ring around the front of the buds. Thus, I find I can only wear them for maybe 10 minutes at a time before I notice that my ears are in pain and have a ring shaped indentation in them. Ouchies."
2,Sound OK but ... ouch.,Bought these as a replacement for my iPod headphones that came with my 3rd gen Nano.The Sennheisers just plain hurt. The buds are bigger than the iPod buds. They have a hard plastic bump that irritated my ear canal. A few minutes into a 45-minute run I yanked them out. Ow!I ran back to the car and went right to Target to pick up a pair of iPod buds. They sounded just as good as the Sennheisers but were a ton more comfortable.(Sure I like nice audio - I run a Denon receiver at home with B&W; speakers. To my ears the iPod phones are good enough.)
4,They're OK...,"but that's it, just OK. I wouldn't say they're any better than the iPod earphones. The bass is just average, the overall clarity is average. They're good for the price, however. And Sennheiser is a great company with solid products. I also own Etymotic er4 isolators, and they're far superior, but they cost well over $150.00. I guess for the price the MX51's do the job."
2,Bad replacement for IPOD headphones,"I bought these thinking they'd be a better alternative to the IPOD headphones. Truth is, now I have more respect for the little white earbuds that shipped with my IPOD nano video.These sennheisers don't live up to the name, and appear weak in every aspect of sound compared to the standard issue ipods.Also, the buds on the sennheisers are slightly larger than those on the ipods .. so they don't fit in my ear as well."
1,Que porquería,No me duraron más de 3 meses. Y sólo los compré porque son Sennheiser. Pero deben ser los peores de toda la categoría.
1,Not good...,The set that I received had some noise coming from some wiring problems. I sent it back. I don't know if it happened that I received a defect or if this product has problems acroos the board.
1,Grout Removal Tool,I made a mistake buying this item. It will never be used by me in the future. There was no info in the description which clearly showed one would need a reciprical electrical saw to use it. I thought it was a hand tool.This item is for a professional who works on a whole room of tile. I just needed to remove ten tiles in one row.I ended up using a chisel and hammer to complete the job.
5,Well worth the money,"My trusty Sawzall is probably the one small power tool I could not live without, so when I saw the Grout Grabber for the first time, purchasing it was a relatively easy decision. The white grout around a shower in our home had past its prime, and replacing it became the Grout Grabber's first challenge. In less than 2 hours the grout between the 6x6 tiles had been worked down low enough to allow for a new grout application. Wow! Try 2 days or more with a traditional hand tool. The blade action held up well--no noticable ware. I had no trouble reaching all angles and surfaces. The only mistake I made was not buying additional blades when I originally purchased the Grout Grabber--it only comes with one, and unless you have 1/16"" grout lines, you'll want at least 2 blades."
3,Grout Grabber overpriced for using carbide blade,"The product concept is good, but the blade quality is not. A normal carbide blade should be in the $$$ range not $$$. I purchased this tool with 3 blades, it removed the grout great for probably 20 linear feet, by then the blades were worn out. Either lower the price for the product and the blades or come up with a diamond blade."
2,Grout grabber -- forget buying this one!,"My husband returned this one immediately. The photo shows that it will do up to 3/4"" of grout, but that's only if you buy three of them (and add them together--which he didn't do). For $45 for three, you are better off investing in a much better tool to do the job. I guess if you had a 12"" spot to redo, this tool might be good for you. However, my husband purchased the Fein Multimaster tool (that he saw at the same time on TV as an informercial) for $260 and is absolutely AMAZED at the speed and efficiency at which the tool removes grout--not to mention in a clean and consise manner. It saved him hours and hours worth of tedious work. He initially balked at the price, but now says that the tool is worth it's weight in gold and would certainly recommend it to anyone needing to remove grout, tile, etc."
2,did not work for me,The grout grabber looks great in theory and would have saved a lot of time removing grout against the wall. I could not manage to keep it in the groove. I tried 2 reciprocating saws and the grout grabber walks all over the place.
2,Grout Grabber GG001 Tool,"The GG001 tool works okay cutting through grout, but the blades are pretty light duty. I thought it could be used to remove thinset from the back of used tiles and found the GGHDB blade(s) was too light duty. Emailed their ""customer service"" to find out if their GG002 blade was heavier duty, since it costs five times more than the GGHDB and received no response. I took a chance and when the [...] dollar shipping blade arrived, it was the same as the GGHDB Blade! Apparently they give a price break to Home Depot (as in HDB)and not to their other distributors. Their ""customer service"" would not confirm this. I'd check out the Milwaukee grout removal tool, it's much better quality, less expensive, and I suspect their Customer Service has nothing to hide."
3,Works Great but replacement blades are an issue,"I'm in the process of remodeling a bathroom. I was looking for a means of removing the grout between tiles that would produce a minimum level of dust. The grout grabber worked wonderfully. However, the blade wore out relatively quickly (worn to the point no more carbide grit is visible on the blade) and the high cost of the blades (measured as a percentage of the original cost of the tool) coupled with the small number of places that carry replacements has forced me to consign the grout grabber to the bottom of my tool box. I am considering modifying the grabber to use the standard carbide grout blades that are available at my local home center but that is a project for another day."
1,Not as Advertised,This product definitely did not work as advertised. The blade was worn out and ineffective before I had even finished the first row of tiles. No doubt that is why this product is available by internet order only. No reputable retail or big box store would want to carry this product and deal with the consumer complaints. Never again!
5,happy customer,"To Whom It May Concern, I would like to take a moment of your time to let you know how impressed i have been with the Grout Grabber. Our company purchased this product after seeing an advertisement in a professional trade magazine. I must admit we had our doubts initially. Our past experiences with the purchasing of products through magazines has been very negative. Often our expectations are inflated by the advertisement and quickly let down once we receive the product. The Grout Grabber has been the overwhelming exception to our experiences. The Grout Grabber has several features that have made our daily work much easier. It has proved useful in several occasions and seems to have no limit to its flexibility and power. We especially appreciate the Grout Grabbers ability to handle and manage like a custom tool. This tool has been the answer to our prayers and i recommend it to anyone. Sincerely Bill Larkin Field Supervisor"
2,Effective but short lived...,"Product worked very well out of the package as described. Was the fastest method I tried for my job. However, the blades did wear down after about 24-28 linear feet of cutting. Did not find this product very cost effective as I was using 3 blades at a time and attempting to rotate them through the blade positions. It is also not a ""dust free"" process. This tool definitely creates dust, although it creates the least of all the methods I did try. I did switch over to a dremel type tool with a diamond grout cutting blade that lasted much longer and was a better option for me as I had a big removal job (300 s.f) I cannot recommend the Grout Grabber unless you have a small job such as bathroom floor or shower stall.Was very happy with the service from the Flooring Connection who sold the extra blades for this product."
3,Unrealistic dialogue,"I really wanted to like this book. I have read other books by this author and have enjoyed them, but I cannot get past the dialogue. People just don't converse like that in real-life America."
3,Lots of Strings,"I have read quite a few of Millie Criswell's books and I have always really enjoyed them. I have to say that I was rather disappointed by this book. It didn't flow as naturally as her other books. The way the characters spoke to each other was just not realistic. I also had a very hard time liking a lot of the characters. Samantha the heroine was ridiculous. She has a guy she had been in love with forever and when he finally realizes he loves her back and wants to be with her she just flat out refuses to believe it. A lot of the minor characters were just plain unlikeable, the subplot with the brother who was a jerk but still got a HEA was also disappointing. Every character in this book wanted love but only on their exact terms so there were lots of strings attached with everything."
4,"Short, but sweet","This is a very short book but more interesting than I thought it would be, sisters interested in the same women( like brothers?) I don't know mostly I thought it would be the opposite but this was good but short."
5,Entertaining Romance,"There were definitely some awesome genes going on in this family to have both daughers being lesbians. Actually, two of my friends come from families like this so it can happen, but their parents aren't gay....or are they?Anyway, Herring writes a humorous, realistic, romance. If you take out some of the strange stuff, it is a fantastic read. I've read it three times since I bought it. It brings a smile to my face."
1,Poor Quality and Instruction,"I picked this set of DVDs up hoping for a fun, challenging, and entertaining workout. These DVDs are the worst quality fitness DVDs I've ever seen (and I have a lot of them). 1) There is very little instruction or direction on how do to anything. 2) The music from the belly dance DVD is from a yoga CD that I have - it's just not suitable for belly dance. All the music is horrible 3) The quality of the film is very poor. They are set up in some white, almost dirty looking studio. 4) I didn't get a workout. The moves were boring and poorly executed. Please don't buy this."
1,dont waste your money,Totally duped by the cover art. This was filmed in a dirty garage. Denise says the wrong direction several times. It confuses the backup dancers and thus the viewer. She has absolutely no energy. It is laughable. Go for a walk instead!
1,Fell For the Cover Photo!!!,"Dingy setting, instructors who clearly know nothing about the genre they're teaching, and awkward studio dancers. Total waste of money!"
1,Terrible,"This DVD was a joke. The pictures on the front and back are not of the ""dancers"" in the video. I never broke a sweat and I danced better than the dancers teaching. I was a belly dancer in college, and it was obvious that the woman teaching had never so much as taken a class. Absolute joke: waste of money. I'll do better research next time."
1,The worst workout DVD ever!,"The worst workout DVD ever! It looks like it was filmed in someone's garage. They must have spent 99% of their entire budget on the DVD jacket design and spent what little they had left on amateurs to pretend they knew what they were talking about. I bought this DVD at Target and I've learned my lesson. Never again will I purchase a workout DVD without doing some research on it's quality first. If you buy this DVD, you might as well be burning your cash. Frankly, that might be more fun than trying to workout to this DVD."
1,The Worst,I agree with the other reviews. I only made it through the Hip Hop DVD and it was awful. Very poor quality. Don't waste your money.
5,Excellent product,"The Urnex coffee machine cleaner was easy to use (Cuisinart 1200). The difference: night and day. I should have done this eons ago. My coffee tastes so much better, even after one month. I hope the effect lasts for at least 3 months. Good price too!"
5,Clean as a whistle,"This product works very well. One 'brew' with the cleaner and two brews with plain water to rinse, and the entire coffee maker looks like new. Wish the shipping didn't cost nearly as much as the product itself (which is why I went ahead and bought 2 boxes), but even so, it's worth the price."
3,works well,"Ran it a few times through my pot and was surprised to see all the dirty water come out. Also came with 3 packets for about $5, so was a good deal for me."
5,Recommended for Brewstation,"Application = Hamilton Beach Brewstation 47665Improved brew time, by cleaning out gunk that builds up from hard water and such.Improved coffee taste, since it does a darn good job of cleaning any residual oils or grime. This coffee maker has a mesh filter and several corners that are hard to clean thoroughly.Improved pour flow (to mug), as the mesh filter for the dispenser is no longer choked by the aforementioned oils & grime.This product is simple and effective. I tried the products available at my local stores, but they just do not compare."
5,Urnex Cleaner Amazing!!,"I've always used a water vinegar mix in my coffee pots and boy was I wrong. This stuff is so easy, simply empty the packet into 4 cups (32 oz.) of water and pour it in. Let it brew through and WOW.Black water came out of the machine. After that, ran clear water through 3 times until it was clean and let me tell you. Amazing deal here folks and my Cuisinart is like new. Great deal."
4,Actually works,"I've tried using vinegar to clean our coffee maker and while it does a decent job, this product actually got rid of more hard water scale that the vinegar had left behind. We used filtered water but there is still some build up and this cleaner busted right through it."
5,This stuff really works!,I had some stains in a coffee pot that I just couldn't get out...this removed the stain without any hassle.
5,Comes in handy to stock up!,I purchased enough to stock up for my espresso machine because I seem to have to descale it quite often.... It was inexpensive and works well!
5,easy to use,This product worked well on my nespresso machine. Much less costly than the descaler nespresso sells & works just as well.
3,"Good product, but not economical to use",Product is fine. The coffee shop says it will clean up anything having to do with coffee....but... I thought I was getting a bigger size box than I saw down at the coffee shop that would make it more economical to use. This box is the same small size though. (about 2 1/2 by 6 inches) Has 3 envelopes for 3 uses. Says to use once per week. The price for 1 box with shipping is about 11 dollars. That is around 100 dollars per year! Good if they made a bigger size. Maybe they do but I can't find it. If needed I will buy this at the coffee shop and skip the high shipping cost. I may be missing something here (buy in bulk?) but thought I'd pass on the warning.Update: Funny....I was at the super market the other day and saw the same box for about 3.50 as in the coffee shop. It is that shipping cost that is the real surprise. Where there is a will there is a way!
3,"Effective cleaner, but Starbucks support says don't use it!","I've been using this product for two years on my Starbucks Barista espresso machine and I think its been doing a good job.Lately my espresso has been off, so I called Starbucks tech support. While the problem was unrelated, they asked how and how often I descale my machine. I told them Cleancaf and that I do it monthly.The nice support agent said to stop using CleanCaf and use pulp-free lemon juice instead, or I'd risk voiding my warranty. She also said don't bother descaling but once every 3 months at most.No more cleancaf for me!"
4,ENJOYABLE,"William Powell has always been a favorite of mine. Likewise, he was in this mystery. it was entertaining and I will watch it again."
3,"Pretty good, but...",The side pull up rail was kind of loud when I would pull it up. The whole bed would shake once it got into place. But all in all this is a nice bed.
1,THIS CRIB IS TERRIBLE!,WE'VE HAD THIS CRIB FOR A LITTLE OVER A YEAR NOW AND ONE OF THE SLATS ON THE SLIDING PART OF THE CRIB HAS BROKEN OFF TWICE IN 2 MONTHS. MY SON DOES NOT HAVE SUPER HUMAN STRENGTH NOR IS HE UNUSUALLY LARGE. A CRIB SHOULD BE A SAFE PLACE FOR A BABY. THANK GOD I WAS RIGHT THERE WHEN IT HAPPENED OR ELSE HE COULD HAVE GOTTEN HIS HEAD STUCK. THE MANUFACTURER IS TAKING THEIR SWEET TIME RESOLVING THIS ISSUE. I GUESS YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR.
4,DON'T USE BUMPERS,I don't own this crib but have owned one just like it for almost 9 years now. It has the same end design where you can't tie a bumper on the crib. I've read all the reviews from your customers regarding this crib. Several made the comment how the bumper can't be tied or that it fits funny. DON'T USE A BUMPER whether it fits in your crib or not. They are suffocation & choking hazards. They may look pretty but remove them before your baby starts moving around. It's much better for your baby to knock his/her head on the side than to get stuck under or wrapped up in a bumper pad only for you to come in and find him/her suffocated or strangled.
3,"Fun games, bad graphics.","To start with a positive comment,the selection of games is amazing. They are also fun to play and challenging. The real downside is that there haven't been graphics this pathetic in games since the early 90's.It is very annoying to install as well. You first run the main installation from the disk, then every time you play a new game you have to find the cd and install that particular game. On a good note, once each game has been individually installed, you don't need the cd in the drive to play the game (unlike Hoyle).So, if you don't care what it looks like and have the patience to install individual games over and over, this deluxe suite may be great for you."
1,I haven't seen graphics this bad since Atari!,"Horrible graphics and boring, uninteresting games. I bought it to play Gin Rummy, which I was never able to figure out. Definately not worth the money."
1,one ugly magazine,"who ever wrote the editorial review must have gotten big bucks. I am a big big socialist, and have read the magizine, and think that the it is a load of crap!"
1,FAKE!!!,Buyers beware! This bag and all of the other balenciagas sold on amazon are obvious (and expensive) fakes!
5,The Last Casualty,A quick and exciting read! Hope this will be the first in a series of Chris Parsons mysteries...I highly recommend this book!!Two thumbs up!!!
3,The Beatles,Almost all Lennon and very little Mccartney in this well done Doc. that was disappointing. It almost seems the filmakers are a bit biased against PM
1,Dreadful!,"Irregular cutting action, and crooked as well. Attachment holes are not to standard dimensions. Recommend Amazon drop this vendor in favor of Nicholson Prestige from Cooper Tools; higher price, but better quality and great durability."
3,eh..its ok,"the songs are very original, but no real beat to jam in your car. The songs are good, but if you like more upbeat dont invest in this. If your into good old fashion music with a meaning (of some sort) then this is for you. As for me, its my style of music, i thought it would be more jammin'."
4,Good debut,"His song ""I Like That"" got old real quick but the rest of the cd was suprisingly very good. I was sort of disappointed by usher's new cd but this one turned out to be pretty solid. I'd defintely recommend getting this if you're into a mix of rap and r&b cuz this one fits the bill."
2,Disturbingly Bad,Im not into the whole R&B thing but even if i was i wouldnt like this. The only song worth buyin the CD for is I like That this Cd is gonna be a coaster on a table in my room. This sucks.
3,Solid debut from Houston!!!,When i listened to this album i was not blown away.his vocal skills are good but i believe that the future albums will be great.He has so much potential wiht the right coaching he could be on the top.The album feel sincomplete to me..maybe because if those interludes weren't there then everything will feel complete................Standout Tracks are:**My Promise feat Letoya (Yes the former Destiny's Child member of the origial group..SHE CAN SING!)MY FAVORITE SONG ON THE CD**Didn't Give A Damn (nice solful song fromt he brotha)should be a single**Twizala(i guess its a new term..but overall still a good song to groove to)**I Like That (Kinda tired of this song..playe dout but its aight)Overall grade...he gets a 79/100= C+
2,Grew on me`,I wish i could change my star rating..But i cant..But look at first i hated this cd...But it grew on me..And i like it..I play a couple of songs here an there on my Ipod mixed in..I'd say I go with about 3-4 songs from this cd ..So my real opinion would probably be around...3-4 stars..
1,"Yep, It IS Already Written...that he'll be a one-hit wonder!","Lord, here we go again. A new act (I say act cuz he damn sho ain't no artist)w/ a 1st single w/ a hot a$$ beat that you can bop ya head to, or even get up n' do the ""chickenhead dance"" to that comes complete only w/ tripe, elementary lyrics that cater to people under the age of 17 that is the BEST song on the debut album. That bonehead from Disturbing The Peace, I-20 once siad that what he likes about Houston is that he writes his own lyrics. And, then I thought...""WTF? Big f---ing deal that he writes his own lyrics! Any fool can write I like that, I like that, I like that..."" for 4 f---ing mins. straight, and then... BOOM! you've apparently got a hit on your hands!""I betcha a yr. from now, everybody'll be askin', ""Hey, whateva happened to that ""Dallas"" kid, or was it ""ATL"", or Chi-town"" maybe? Just sit him right next to that ""F--- It! Don't Want You Back"" has one of the biggest One-Hit Wonders of the yr."
2,5..4..3..2..1...Houston WE HAVE A PROBLEM,"Signed by Capital, first-timer ""Houston"" is back with an average album. He came out at the wrong time Usher did, because he is being named as a clone ""Usher"" (which he can never be). His style is mediocre and basically a one hit wonder unless he can come back stronger the second time around. We'll see if Houston can come back down to earth."
3,houston why did you let satan pocess you,not a bad party cd but because of low sales houston doing crack and pocessed by satan decided to gauge his eye out true story inddeed.
4,just what i was looking for,this was the cd i wanted bad. because i was expecting a cd that has songs that could be played in parties for people to enjoy. when i heard the songs from beginning too end it turned me on and i couldn't stop listening too it since it's so addicting.
4,he could do better,He has potential but this album was good enough.Its his first and it felt like he rushed it.My Promise is the hottest song on there. besides i like that.his other songs like she is and its alreadywritten were so wack oh my god what was he thinking but my promise made up for that
3,Its OK - 3.5 really,"Yes its all been written before. however there are some hot tracks tho.I like that (ofcourse)Aint nothing wrongMy Promise (only like the instrumental)Love you downAllright (very catchy chorus)She is (terrible lyrics though - seems he made no effort).Not enough good tracks to make a good album. But the rest of the album is tollerable. I would say he is an average singer, probably to stick to high tempo R&B; songs like ""I Like That"" & ""Allright"". And whats up with that last track ""Its already written pt2"", its wack, did someone sneak this track into the album without ne1 knowing?.Worthy of a download... Did I say download? ; )"
1,Houston we have a problem,"I had the honors, if you can call it that, to receive a free download of this cd. Not familiar with Houston, I decided to at least give it a good listen. Well, i am so glad it was free. Not to be too harsh, but this is a typical singer, with a typical sound. None of the cuts really moved me. There are a few slow jams, and some rap, but other than that I don't think this cd will break any records or receive any awards. I was just not feeling this guy. Maybe his next effort will be better. But I do give the guy his props for having a cd out, However, Houston we have a problem. 1*"
5,Get this cd,"This cd is awesome and so worth the money. Honestly when I first bought it I mostly bought it for ""I Like That"" which I still havent gotten sick of. After that I listenened to the entire cd and it is great. There is not a bad song on there. I like them all. Houston has such a good mix of uptempo and slow songs and dance club type sounds. He has a good style and is just real cool and smooth with everything. And yes he does have a different type of sound and is the next Usher but doesnt really resemble him. Plus he writes his own lyrics, Usher doesnt. I wish Houston got more publicity and people knew about him more cause he is a superstar in the making. Get this cd you wont be disappointed!!!!"
2,SUCKED!!!,"C'mon people, if you dont smell one hit wonder, then you're seriously retarded. But I know most people are intelligent enough to know that this record is not worth a purchase, and if you're not, then I'm here to tell you NOT to buy this! I repeat, DO NOT BUY THIS! The only good song is I like That, and that still borderline trash. Houston just doesnt say anything, and any record that has Chingy in it, well c'mon, I dont think I have to say anymore. Final verdict, Hot Garbage.I'm Out!"
3,The freshman,"I don't feel nothing special with Houston. I have to agree with the other reviews, that he may end up being a one hit wonder. The album is not that bad, he has a few hits and misses. But nothing special that makes me want to keep it in replay.1. It's Already Written Part I n/a2. I Like That 5/53. Twizala n/a4. Twizala 1/55. Ain't Nothing Wrong 3/56. My Promise 2/57.

3,SATISFACTORY BUT NOT IDEAL.,It's pretty good but it has a small container for the cheese that must be cut into small pieces before fitting in the grater.Not for use in grating large amounts of cheese.Still looking for better product.
1,a terrible mistake,terrible performance not wort the money does not grate the cheese in an acceptable way and is too small for a family use I definatly going to raccomand this product personally I had better axpectation fro a compani like DeLonghi
3,Not a bad grater,"This grater is good for parmeggiano or other hard cheeses, but that's about it. No extra attachments, just the fine grater. Also hard to take apart and clean."
1,Watch out ! Harry Potter is satan in disguise !,"NOT.Wohlberg's book is just another piece of crappola out on the market trying to further spread the misinformation regarding Wicca and Witchcraft, usually from Christian publishers. Hmmm...There is nothing sinister about Harry Potter, and people who think that there is (that J.K. Rowling is satan in disguise, for example) need to actually read some of the HP books and/or see the movies before ignorantly spewing messages of hate such as the ones found in this book."
4,"Hour of the Witch, nicely done.","I found the ""Hour of the Witch"" to be a refreshingly sane look at Wiccaand some of the cultural pressures which help it to flourish here inAmerica.It is a balanced look at the topic from a Christian perspective, and Ifor one, appreciate the lack of shrill sensationalism that generallyaccompanies a book on the subject from a Christian author.Mark BishopEx-Occultist"
1,insane,I generally try not to write a reveiw or say anything about the reviewers...but who the heck would give this steaming pile of rubbish anything other than one star...are you insane? what kind of fruitcakes raise children that are incapable of knowing the difference between fantasy and reality? Harry Potter is Satanic--are you SERIOUS? Get a life.And as for thinking that burning books is admirable enough to mention in a review...thank goodness I was raised by sensible parents that taught me to think for myself--and made me read the ALA's banned book list as a teenager...
2,Better than ambien,"It's better than sleeping pills, which is why I give it two stars instead of zerooooo. And what a silly thing to think, Harry Potter is just a fun book, it's not out to wreck the jesus people. So why are they jumping all over this fun fiction that has got kids away from TV and back to reading for a change? And besides, I resent the idea that Harry Potter somehow represents real Wiccan beliefs. Trying to somehow relate Harry Potter to Wicca is like saying Spiderman is related to all the webs of deceit the Bush whitehouse weaves on a daily basis."
1,It's what I thought it would be......,"I bought ""Hour of the Witch"" just to see if it was what I thought it would be - and I was right.If you believe that the Bible is 100% accurate and every religion other than Christianity is inspired by Satan (aka ""The Boogeyman"") you'll like and agree with this book.However if you're not Christian (I'm not), and think the Bible is just a book written over thousands of years, ""Hour of the Witch"" is not worth the time or trouble."
1,It helps to know what you protest before writing a whole book about it,"Harry Potter has nothing to do with Wicca or Witchcraft (Wicca is a path of Witchcraft). In order to claim otherwise, the author of this 'book' really had to make up a lot of materials.This would be like another author trying to insist that Christmas sales are intrisically part of the traditional Christian holiday season despite department stores and/or advertising inserts not appearing anywhere in the Bible.It's good for a laugh and might have *some* iota of merit in a creative writing class (the VERY far-fetched claims would not have been put together without creativity!). However, this can't be taken as a serious work."
1,Wohlberg's Anti-Harry Potter Book is a Snore,"Harry Potter Books are about discovery, magic and overcoming evil. It is obvious that Wolberg did not read Harry Potter Books and is clueless about Wicca Witchcraft. How dare he insult Harry Potter. He compares Harry to Wicca and Witchcraft. His point is........... Apparently Wohberg gets his information about the craft (wicca or otherwise) from Propaganda Grimms Brother Fairy tales that turn Wise old women healers into a mean evil witches and helping animals into boggymen. How sad that Wolberg promotes his Christian Spiritual beliefs by demonizing another's Spiritual Path. Nevertheless, there is freedom of the press. Wolberg has a constitutional right to write such a silly book. My inclination is to use the book to build a campfire for a Harry Potter hotdog and smores party. Blessed Be"
5,"MONGUITO ""EL UNICO""- ""DE TODO UN POCO""","Issued by Fania around 1970, this was perhaps, cuban sonero ""Monguito's"" best selling album. It was albums like this one which made Fania releases, the favorites of latinos everywhere for nearly 20 years."
1,A shame,"This book is a disapointment. Although Nozick is one of the best contemporary philosophers, he wrote a self-help book! If you really want this kind of book, buy it - maybe you'll find something in it. If you want to buy because of Nozick I really recommend ""Anarchy, State and Utopia""."
2,Difficult read,I couldnt read this book beyond the first chapter. Long winding and boring. One of the dullest books on philosphy.
3,"ok, if you like this sort of thing","...and far from ok if you don't. Nozick's book has a tendency toward sentimentality, but I do think he is to be applauded for trying to take on these issues. So rarely does a philosopher write about things that really matter to us, like love or death or family or sex. I suppose the price you pay for writing about human issues like these is a sacrifice of rigour and an unfortunate tendency to sound like a self-help book.Nevertheless, the book is worth reading, if only because it reminds us where philosophy comes from and why we think in the first place. I disagreed with Nozick often and consider some of the chapters puff pieces, but I must admit that it's been a long time since I read a contemporary philosophical work that made me consider changing the way I think and act."
1,Very disappointed,"I bought this book, excited about the opportunity to read what purported to be a thoughtful man's ruminations about the big questions in life. I've never found a book to be so disappointing and frustrating. Nozick seems to have an ""instinct for the capillary."" It's maddening how he'll start out on a topic that offers some promise and then go off on a tangent about one or more trivial aspects related to that topic. To give one example: He has a chapter on parenting. Not being a parent myself, I was still interested in hearing about the process of bringing another person into the world, the sacrifices, the joys and disappointments, and how it does or does not give meaning to one's life, etc. etc. Instead, I got a chapter devoted primarily to how inheritance laws should be fashioned. Exasperating is the best word for this book, I'm sorry to say. I read about four chapters and then could take no more."
3,3.5 stars - Another good book by this author!,"This is another good book by Sarah Mayberry. At first I really didn't like the cocky, egotistical, manwhore Jack Brooks, but as the story unfolds I understood by he was a no-relations man. It took a while to get to the elevator scene but from then on the sexual tension was kept pretty high. You also get an understanding of Claire's insecurities as well. This was a great realistic book where there isn't insta-love but hate turns to attraction turns to love."
4,Lack of morals,"I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book about morals on college campus's. I was shocked to learn that so many students were able to validate their lack of morals and considered cheating to be the the norm in college classrooms.I cannot figure out how this acceptance of lying and cheating came to be...I just hope it passes. I think this is a book all high school seniors should read and discuss. Hopefully, they will choose to not become part of the ""new moral conscience."""
4,Best 4 Megapixel Camera In The World.,I have it. Believe me. The only thing that isn't that great is that it uses Smartmedia cards that really suck. Otherwise it's great. Just get a 128MB Smartmedia card with it and you're set.
3,Olympus C4000 software GOUGE,"I am very disappointed with the software that comes with the camera as it does not include an email option. If you want to send pictures to your family or friends you will have to send Olympus an extra $20 to have additonal software activated. The help file included in the software is very good about describing how to use the email, it just does not give you a clue that you have to pay extra to actually use it. A customer service agent at Olympus admits that they get a lot of calls about the issue but would not give me the software. So I intend to pack up the camera and give it back."
1,Poor - Read Why,"PROS:- Lithium battery- 4 MegapixelsCONS:- Olympus is not a good brand honestly, (get Canon or Sony)- HUGE! This is NOT a portable camera!- Looks bad- Bad controls (4 way switches)- So much more better cameras out there on the market!If you want a hulky camera like this I suggest the new Sony Cybershot DSC V1, which looks better, is easier to use, and is more solidly made.But anyway, if you are the average person looking for a camera to simply get your everyday enjoyances, I suggest a good, compact Point and Shoot camera. Not a big bulky one like this Olympus which isn't that special."
1,Don't buy this camera they stopped making memory cards for it!!!,I had this camera for years it has been a good camera but they don't make storage media (smart media card) for it anymore... to buy a storage card is quite costly now nearly 400 times what new media storage is going for. Don't buy it!!!
3,Red Eye,"This camera generally takes very good pictures but I do have one complaint that has not been resolved. Even with red eye reduction feature on, it still takes bad redeye, especially with babies. The software does not eliminate it either. I have been through their customer service several times for this and one other problem and they were not helpful. I felt I was being talked down to and I finally gave up. I like the camera except for that, but I probably would not buy another Olympus unless customer service is more helpful."
4,I love this camera!!!,"The camera is just outstanding! I love it! I had it for about a year and the pictures are just great. It has ton of options and even after a year, I haven't used them all.There are several reasons, hovever, why I gave it only 4 stars. 1. The cap on the lense got to go. I forgot to take it off once just when I bought the camera, and the camera died on me. I had to send it back for a replacement.2. It's pretty bulky and you have to carry it around in it's own case, which could be problematic when you go to other countries and don't want to attract attention.3. The flash makes everybody blink and it's hard sometimes to get a good picture.Other than that, I would highly recommend the camera and I would buy it again in a second!Buy it."
3,Olympus Camedia Camra,"This camera was discontinued by the manufacturer since 2002. In its day i was a very good camera with many fine features, but today supplies for this camera are hard to fine. For anyone very knowledgable in operating this camera it may be an economical way to get a camera with many fine features. But, I would not recommend it for an elderly buyer unable to cope with the drawbacks.The seller of the camera had the highest standards of customer satisfaction and handled the return with the greates courtesy."
5,Cool -- It works with Linux!,"If you're going to use this camera with Linux, don't waste your time with gPhoto (it won't work anyway). In fact, getting this camera to work with Linux is really easy.Just connect the USB cable to the camera and your computer and Linux automatically detects the camera as a SCSI device. So just mount it as normal:mount -t vfat /dev/sda1 /mnt/cameraAnd get your pictures from the filesystem!"
5,wow,This is my first 4mb digital cam and i love itit takes very good picture sharp and does not change the colori bought the cam over a month ago and i took over 500pic useing the same batts that i'v got with my cam. so i dont know yet regard other batts but the power seems to last.I use the auto mode for most of my pics and use the cam lcd to review them.I also used the man mode and know it's good to have control at all the parm live speed and F ... and so oni took some night shot at slow speed (16sec) that came out excelent and also some micro shots.I recomend this cam for all i bought it for 500$ after tax and I'm happy even dou you can get it for under 500$when you buy this cam or any other dont forget to buy lot's of mem and batts
2,An awsome camera - 5 years ago!,"My parents gave me this camera five years ago when my daughter was born. Not having any real experience with cameras, I am just now learning to use the manual settings on it. Even so, I have taken some studio quality images using just the auto settings, but the images don't print well any larger than about a 5X7. My two biggest complaints are the lag time between pressing the button and the shot actually being taken, and the lens cover. I really liked the way my 35 mm had a lens cover that opened automatically when the camera was turned on, since about half the time, even after 5 years, I forget to take it off. My parents specifically bought a camera that had a viewfinder, but I must say I never use it.However, I have decided I need to upgrade for more pixels. I would not recommend this camera to anyone, especially for the price I see here, because the newer cameras are better and cheaper."
4,Amazing digital camera....thumbs up!,"I have nothing bad to say about this camera. My husband is a professional photographer who shoots with the Olympus digital SLR cameras...the images off the c-4000 look equally as impressive, for a lot less cash. It even has flash sync hook ups for his studio lighting. I sure wish it took compact flash instead of smartmedia, but it is worth dealing with that drawback for the camera. That and the fact that if you turn it on with the lens cap attached, it makes this grinding noise and tries to extend the lens anyway lead to not getting all 5 stars...I do this from time to time and worry that I am going to mess something up! Action shots come out blurry using the automatic settings, but my husband says they would be fine if I knew even a smidge about manual settings...oh well! All in all, an excellent choice..this was my sixth digicam, and I am stopping!"
2,Very cheap quality videos,"I can't believe how amaturist these videos are!! The concert DVD is acceptable, but the regular videos look as if they were made by a 10 year-old kid. Not for 10 seconds the camera stays still, always moving, pathetic lighting, horrible backgrounds. I kind of regret buying it, but at least I can still listen to the music. Anyway, enjoy."
4,An older work full of info,"Dave Line originally published this book in 1978, a year before his death. While a lot has changed, and some of the terms may seem a bit unusual for those of us on the American side of the pond, there really is a lot of good information here. Of particular note is the number of great recipes here; though since the use of malt extracts were not as common twenty-five years ago, most of the recipes include raw grains and hops instead of the liquidized and pelletized versions more common today. Thus, without a knowledge of how to figure the conversion ratios, newcomers such as myself may find themselves doing things a bit more of the ""old-fashioned"" way. This is fine by me, but might be something to bear in mind if you are just getting your toes wet."
4,Great product,"Product is as stated. works well seems pretty accurate. The other owner would have seen if he read the manual that you can get another light for the tach if it goes out. You just have to contact autometer-its supposed to last the life of the tach. Also the directions show in picture form how to hook up the tach to a few different types of systems. Idiot proof in my opinion. So I'm not exactly sure why some say the installation instructions are bad. My only reasoning for 4 stars is that it claims on the box the be made in USA but on the bottom of the box it says, ""custom made in TAIWAN for Autometer"". So I'm not sure who to believe. I prefer to buy made in USA when I can. Otherwise the tach looks and works great. I will be buying more autogage in the future"
3,NICE UNIT,"THIS IS A NICE UNIT FOR THE PRICE. ONLY DRAW BACK YOU CANNOT CHANGE LITE WHEN IT GOES OUT, SO YOU WOULD HAVE TO BUY A COMPLETE UNIT. NOT TOO BRIGHT ON ENGINEERING SIDE."
3,"Measurement and Evaluation in Psychology and Education, 8 th Ed.","Very informative book and useful for its intended purpose. However, small script size with poor color contrast make it a very difficult read. If you use glasses, get stronger ones. Mathematical problems could benefit from more solution examples."
4,Statistics for Psychology & Education,"Excellent book, however the type font used is very thin and the ink light, so it makes it difficult to read for long periods of time. If publisher is going to stay with this type of print, than perhaps more white space between the lines would be better. Of course, then the book would be even thicker,and cost more too.U of Rockies student"
3,Comprehensive,"This text is comprehensive and somewhat technical. A good reference for key terms, concepts, and calculations used in studying Tests and Measurements."
4,Worth the money,"This is a truly excellent series. My 10yo son who loves baseball really enjoyed it. It is not exciting enough to watch continuously, so he takes a break. But very well done and worth the money for the extended collectors edition, which has much more detail."
5,At Long Last,"Aside from the original Twilight Zone, this is the only TV series I've watched which could make the hair on the back of my neck stand up. I am soooo glad that the show is finally coming out on DVD. I hope that seasons two and three will quickly follow."
2,Bad Quality,"It surely did take a loooong time coming to DVD! You'd think for the time that fans waited, this would've resulted in better quality.I rented this series and now I'm glad I did instead of purchasing it.Low quality transfer - grain and soft picture, no subtitles and no extras.2 stars but only for releasing the show."
4,Friday The 13 - The Series,"This is a great cult classic from the 1980s. Cursed items with some kind of demons, spirits, or entities attached to them wreck havoc on the lives of those who own them. Plenty of action, some gore, scary moments. An excellent purchase for those involved in, Wicca, Voodoo, or the supernatural."
2,GOOD BAD AND THE UGLY- Friday the 13th the series,"The Good:Super hot shots of Robey (white wife-beater tank top, no bra = yummy)The Bad: this show has not aged all that well, however still sorta enjoyableThe Ugly : the transfer, the overall quality of these episodes a/v wise is very below par."
5,Miss the 90's!,Love Love Love this show....was thrilled that it's on DVD. So worth buying. I loved the first two season with John LeMay and ROBEY... brilliant
2,FRIDAY THE 13THE THE SERIES ....,It is so great to have this Series finally on DVD out for the long Awaited Fans I went out and bought two of the DVD'S that is how much of a big fan I am . However I think they could of put more thought on the cover of the DVD And have more Extras . Like adding a booklet with photos of the series and some interviews of the Main Stars also the pitcher quality could be a bit better . So anyways its good to have it out because the next Season may take anther 10 years. Lolol so FIVE ***** for getting out this wounderful series to the fans and Two ** for the packaging ....
5,GR8 DVD,"THE DVD CAME NEW A+ PLAYED GOOD, THE DVD PLAYER DIDN'T WANT TO PLAY ONE EPISODE BUT DID PLAY EPISODE AFTER SOME PLAYING A DVD CLEANER,& ANOTHER DVD . I ENJOYED WATCHING FRIDAY THE 13TH THE SERIES FIRST SEASON IT TOOK ME BACK TO THE 80'S I FORGET HOW COOLTHAT SHOW WAS."
5,great news!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,thanks Paramount for releaseing this tv series on dvd. please do not mess up this series like you done the fugitive season 2 vol 1.
3,My review on Friday 13th the Series,"I had watched Friday 13 series on channel 11 in the early 1990's as a teenager ! 13 'o clock involving a pocket watch from the story of January 2, 1989 had taken place in NYC because of the number 6 train run there !"
3,I loved this show!,"I can only imagine if this show had been made today with the special effects available to televisions shows. My only disappointment is the picture quality (like others have said) is extremely poor, and even worse on HDTV. But..you take what you can get. I've been waiting for this for some time. Bring on Season 2 & 3!"
5,a good spooky series,"The series is the best spooky I have every watched. The stories are great. The actors are good.I like that they have different age actors.I bought this on azmon .com,and I will buy season#2 when I finish #1."
2,Very bad video quality,"Unfortunately, people have been reviewing the show rather than the product. Obviously, someone who will buy this will do so because they liked the show. I won't waste time describing the series, but I will comment on the quality of the DVDs.The video quality is abysmal. It looks as if someone taped the episodes from a (non-digital) TV broadcast onto VHS, and then transferred the VHS onto a DVD. I've seen a bootleg version of the series that was taped during a F13th marathon and it was no worse than these DVDs. The images are grainy and fuzzy and the colors are faded, imprecise, and far too dark. I have shows on DVD that were taped in the 1950s and the images are crisp and the colors vibrant. There's just no excuse for shoddy work like this.Fans will still want this because there are no options, but CBS Studios and Paramount should hang their heads in shame at this blatant display of incompetence and disregard for quality."
1,"Great show, TERRIBLE picture quality","The one star is for how piss-poor the transfer is on this DVD set. We paid 40 dollars for what is basically a bootleg copy! I mean, the episodes on YOUTUBE look better than this!Paramount, you sold us a shoddy product. Please step up and show us that you care about what you put out, product-wise, to the public and fix this error. We paid you our hard earned money for DVD quality and got second generation VHS."
5,Very Good,More detailed explanation of every subject discussed. Nothing was assummed. The appendix include vital information for new SAS users.
5,Solid Book!,"While some passages are repetitive, on the whole, this book is very informative. The author leaves nothing to chance and is thorough in his explanation of various methods and how to reproduce them. The explanations by example are flushed out with no assumptions made about user knowledge, which was great in my case because before reading this book, all I knew about SAS is that it existed. Now, I can apply various and powerful statistical techniques on my own. Thanks Prof. Hatcher!"
3,Mediocre.,"Gibson as a problem: he knows lots of adjectives, and likes to use them. All of them. In one sentence. This causes the reader to skip pages and pages of useless description in order to get to the story, which is extremely frustrating at best, and causes one to lose focus on the story completely. Argh. Listening to this on tape while on the road was even more of a nightmare; you can't really fastforward through it that way. (Besides, he reads with a monotone.)"
5,Wow. Wow. Wow.,"This is the best book by the second best science-fiction author ever. It is absorbing, perfectly paced and overflowing with Gibson's beautifully detailed style. This is the book that hit the world over the head with Cyberspace et al, and inspired the RPG Shadowrun, and all of the rest of the genre. I would recommend this book, and also that you use Amazon. This book costs about $10 in the U.K., so I fell off my chair when I read the price here. I love this book more than my girlfriend. Read it."
4,"Excellent cyberpunk, follows-up Johnny Mneumonic superbly","I found this book to be an excellent addition to the sci-fi community, a genre of which I normally do not like to read. I reccomend this book to everyone, especially if you enjoy the high-tech genre."
2,This book is terrible!!!!!,Anyone interested in becoming familiar with the Cyberpunk genre should not read this book. Gibson trys to place to much information in an already confusing world. A novice sci-fi reader would be lost in all the information. Definitley not what was suspected. Anyone who wants to read real cyberpunk should read Rudy Rucker.
3,Like his other books,"Pesimistic, lots of scene changes, nothing new compared with his other works. OK the ideas here are reworked again. A book for the fans."
2,Overhyped,"I just don't understand the hype surrounding this book. It must be for some of the ideas in the book, because it is certainly not for the writing or plot. The writing is jagged, disoriented & aimless. And it's not as if I have to have fully formed, straight forward sentences to be drawn into a book. Chuck Palahniuk's writing style is not the most straight forward either, but it makes sense. I just could never truly envision the scenes depicted in Neuromancer because Gibson (at least in this book) doesn't seem to be able to paint a scene. Read 2001 by Arthur C. Clarke if you want to read a book by someone who knows about imagery, read Snow Crash by Neal Stephenson if you want modern Cyberpunk, & read Philip K. Dick if you want the REAL father of Cyberpunk."
3,"Not worth the hype, but worth the read.","While I did enjoy the book, it wasn't anywhere the world's greatest novel that many seem to say it is. The plot was shallow, the characters were decent but also a little shallow. The world was an ok futuristic setting, defiantly fits as a cyberpunk genre.The book is a little confusing, many of the aspects are never really explained. And the ending was a build to something great and then just fizzled out. But even with that being said I defiantly would recommend reading it because it's a ok novel."
1,Too difficult to follow,"I found this book hard to read. Struggled through 3 chapters, I finally gave up. Why can't the writer use easier to read English ?"
1,Very Much Over-rated,"I'm glad to see some others had the same reaction I did. I have tried twice now, with several years between attempts, to read this book in its entirety, but I cannot. I don't understand what the ""sensation"" is about this book. To me it's just a chaotic jangle of images. And, frankly, it's boring. Maybe it was indeed cutting edge as a ""cyber punk"" novel when it first came out, maybe getting ""jacked"" into cyberspace was a new concept then, but this novel does nothing for me. There's nothing the author says that is insightful or thought-provoking, in my opinion. Good luck. Apparently many people give this book rave reviews."
1,I hated this book,"When I got this book, I thought I was in for a delight. William Gibson is probably the most famous science fiction writer alive, and Neuromancer got rave reviews from everyone. However, after I finished reading the first page, I was lost already. The plot was almost impossible to decipher because Gibson does not introduce his characters. Basically, a random person will show up and end up being one of the main characters. Gibson's choppy desrcriptions didn't help either. I despise this book with a passion."
4,Simply Put: Great Science Fiction,"'Neuromancer' is one of a handful of books/movies that I would pick to represent the science-fiction genre. Gibson succeeds on all levels here - I enjoyed the story, the characters, the settings, the technology, everything. Gibson writes about imperfection - he doesn't gloss anything over or try to make it too pretty. The characters are flawed, and have weaknesses - just like in real life. They live in a gritty world - just like in real life. And around them all, is technology - just like in real life.'Neuromancer' is the story of Case: a hacker-type, cyberpunk, whatever you want to call him. He makes hackers of today look like amateurs - he totally immerses himself into the machine. Washed-up and raked over the coals, he gets a chance at a come back, even if it isn't on the most pleasant of terms.Read this book if you are a science fiction fan - if for no other reason than to see what all the hype is about. I don't think you'll be disappointed."
2,William Gibson has a problem with clarity.,"In Neuromancer, William Gibson creates a setting that is at once fantastic and reasonable. The characters are perfectly jaded to the novel's advanced technology - plug in the toaster, jack into the matrix, ho humm. Unfortunately, when the narrator has seen it all before, he doesn't spend a lot of time describing what's happening. Gibson's narrator gives you a vague patchwork of the plot - it feels like a drunk's telling you about the movie he just watched. Further, Gibson makes no effort to tell the reader who is speaking. Gibson uses characters he doesn't introduce. Gibson rambles for so long you forget what he is writing about. Don't get me wrong - I feel that a reader should have to work with a book to understand it, but Gibson doesn't even give us a fighting chance."
3,Good story hiding in there,"This is definitely for hardcore fans of the genre and author. It was expertly written, yet some parts left me with a ""WTF?"" expression etched into my face. The action was great and the techie aspects were intelligent and entertaining. It took some patience to get into it, but it was worth it for the most part."
3,Matrix Re-visited.,"Not being an avid sci/fi fan I had never heard of the author nor the book. It was while browsing the Amazon site that I first saw mention of both. Taken by the review I downloaded the book & had a very enjoyable read during which I could clearly see the character Trinity (Matrix) in her leather coat, reflective glasses & her martial art skills. Also defined are some of her motley crew. The book was so enjoyable & informative, I had to revisit & view my Matrix trilogy box-set.This time I had a better & clearer understanding of the series. Recommended!."
3,"Good, but not great","Good read, but a bit hard to follow at times. Interesting and unique story, but lacks the sharp social commentary that makes Science Fiction (especially dystopia genre) so great.I have been on a mission to read all of the Hugo and Nebula winners... This is one of the weaker books on that list. I am surprised it one both. But again, the idea is quite novel...."
3,Worth reading...,"This book was okay.... After seeing all the awards it won, I was expecting something legendary.The concept was fairly interesting, but I guess between the jargon, and the ""technology babble"" (mostly about stuff that doesn't exist yet), it's a little hard to pull just how cool the story was!The main character is a drug-adict/ hacker, who whines a lot... the street-samurai is interesting, but she isn't the entire book. It seems like all the coolest characters get bit parts...The story was very cool, I will give it that... I just wish it would have been a little less fragmented."
2,Difficult read.,"I read often, and love reading. Something about this book made reading it very difficult. The storyline jumps around often (and skips over events) and there are so many characters that it's had to follow. The idea of the book was neat, I just didn't enjoy the execution of it. I personally didn't like the book. However, I know a few people who enjoyed it. It just wasn't for me. You'll have to decide for yourself."
2,don't read if this is your first scifi book,It was my first and it was quite disjointed. I didn't finish it. Not a beginner scifi book even though it may be a classic. Too weird for me.
4,The matrix is dreaming tonight.,"This is a good book that has the feel of dark eighties SF movies, Akira or Metal Gear Solid. It's all here (AI, street samurai, the matrix, hackers, neon city, drugs, arcades, army type lunatics,...) and Gibson does it better than everybody else.Gibson is very good in bringing to life strange and exotic (sub)cultures, like the cowboys and razor girls in this novel or the footageheads in 'Pattern Recognition'. The story's no slouch either.If you're in for a dark SF thriller, you needn't look any further."
2,"Poorly written, hard to follow","When I start reading a good book, I find it hardto put down. I started reading Neuromancer andboth found it easy to put down and hard to pickback up. It did not make sense andwas hard to follow. I do not think this book wouldhave been published had it not been written bya ""known"" author. Avoid this book!"
3,A bit confusing,"I thought Neuromancer was interesting, and that's why I didn't give up on this book after the first 20 pages or so. I have to admit though, that for a good share of this book I had no clue what was going on.The style was definitely not something I enjoy--a bit too high tech for me. The story would have been better for me if it had been written in a different style."
2,"""Virtually"" unreadable.","I did manage to trudge through this novel, but I really had no idea what I had read by the time I finished. I agree with the reviewer below who says that anyone who claims to love this novel is lying!"
2,not worth finishing,"Really liked other books by Gibson but could not bring myself to finish this one despite being stuck in an airport. Story by it self was not worth all the new and redefined language, book supports the hypothesis outlined here[...]."
2,"Good concepts, poor style","I do not usually review books, but I was tempted to buy this book due to the number of stars it had, without reading the reviews. On reading the book, the use of technospeak and just the poor American English and grammar made it a slog to get through. I had to log on when back from holiday to see if I was alone to find the writing style hard work and the lack of a clear plot and non existent characters. I was pleased to see readers giving it 2 and 1 star reviews, that I was not alone. Hence another 2 star to try and bring this book down from it's star rating. Give it a miss."
4,Believe the Hype,"I read this book in July of 2004 and thought it was fantastic. I read it on the advice of a coworker who knew my love for the ""Matrix"" genre. I had never heard of the book, but quickly purchased it, and read it in 3 days. I highly recommend it for those who enjoyed the creativity and imagination of the ""Matrix"" movies."
3,"Good, but overrated.","I loved this book back in the day, and while Gibson's imagery is as tight as ever, I now find his characters and story to need a lot of improvement. However, this book is a classic on a number of levels and has to be considered a must-read for any sci-fi enthusiast."
5,the best imagined future i have ever read,"fabulous, riveting, outstanding stuff...i just read it again after years and it still works! five stars."
5,Sheer brilliance!,"The first chapter caught my attention using term I have never heard before, and creating a world so close to what our own could be like it's frightening. I was amazed by the complexity and lavishness of the characters and settings in the novel. After finnishing this book I remember sitting and thinking to myself about how real this novel could become, and I couldn't wait to read Gibson's next work. Sheer brilliance!"
3,"Cool idea, but disjointed storyline and characters I didn't care about","The review line pretty much says it all. I am a big fan of William Gibson, but this book didn't have the characters or the universe that connected with me. Thankfully, most of his other books are awesome."
3,"Groundbreaking concepts ahead of its time, but weak story","The concepts about cyberspace are what set this book apart when it first came out. The characters and plot kind of just plod along though. I kept expecting the pace to pick up, but instead it just kind of meandered around Case, the usual stereotypical bad boy who isn't really all that bad just mischevious and kind of criminal. It's the whole cyberpunk story complete with a conspiracy situation and our hero's one final chance for redemption! Where have you not heard that one before? Nonetheless, Gibson deserves a great deal of credit for being prophetic though. Personally, my favorite cyberpunk novel remains the underrated and underappreciated ""When Gravity Fails"" by George Alec Effinger, but that's just my taste. Check out at your library, but paying for it might be asking a bit much."
2,gibson's no genius....,"Wow, judging from the rants and raves this must be a good book! Well, no.. At best this might be somewhat entertaining to the average wannabe computer nerd but for me... it just doesn't work. Gibson admits he knows practically nothing about computer science, AI, etc.. and this book proves it with flying colors. After finishing this book(I never leave a book unfinished, even if it sucks as bad as this one) I truly now have no respect for Gibson.. I admire his style but I personally got annoyed by it after a while.."
2,Neuromancer: Not what I expected,"I would have to say that I disliked Neuromancer. I found it hard to understand from the very beginning. The characters and plots were just thrown at the reader without much of an explanation, and I was lost throughout most of the story. I didn't find the whole idea of the book very appealing, either. I was disinterested from the start, which is probably due to the fact that I had no idea what was happening or what had happened in the book. Overall, I would say that for all the good reviews the book had, I was disappointed with it."
5,A razor bladed tongue and a dirty future,"sentences were sharp and brief; if the future could get any darker, then we are truly doomed. I enjoyed Gibson's rapier style and his simplistic method of getting emotion from his characters. When Case jacked in for the first time (again) I cried with him, knowing that recovering a piece of your soul is unlike any absolution that any person can grant. Back in the shadows, someone made wet sounds and died. Literature I hope my grandchildren read in College."
5,Neuromancer's Style Rockets You Into Plot,"Neuromancer paints a unique picture of the future, but his idea could become reality. Crazed corporate families, rastafarians in space, even the idea of 'console cowboys' is innovative. Although the beginning of the book and some sections of the plot were sketchy, the book swept you into the reality of a few souls in their confusing lives. Some people may say that style tried to make up for a weak plot and undeveloped characters. Gibson's style helps push you into a different view of the world, so that you can explore inside on your own."
3,Am I reading The Matrix?,"yes, I enjoyed the book, did I understand most of it?,no, it was confusing to me, but I liked it. Crazy to me it seemed the Wachowski's made this into a movie. You have our main charachter who's basically Neo. A ninja warrior and protector in Trinity, Zion, and jacks in your head through the Marix of another reality. Yes it was interesting and I might pick it up again years from now."
5,ALL books by Gibson are gospel for cyberpunk,"I have virtually every book William Gibson has ever written and they have, essentially, created our current terminology and way of thinking in terms of cyberspace and computers as well as high-tech devices. Such books as ""Mona Lisa Overdrive"", ""Count Zero"", ""All Tomorrow's Parties"", ""Burning Chrome"", ""Pattern Recognition"", as well as other cyberpunk/high-tech books like ""Snow Crash"", ""Cryptonomicon"", and ""Darkeye: Cyber Hunter"". All of these books can take the reader into worlds of cyberspace and computer espionage or danger that no other sci-fi or thriller can take them. All are recommended and William Gibson should receive some cyber-award for what his high-tech imagination has contributed to our computerized society."
5,Enthralling,"Anyone who doesn't like this book, just can't handle it! You'll find yourself confused at the beginning- that's good, but by the end you're living the characters, and taking part in the novel. This is the kind of book that grips you, and doesn't let you stop thinking about it.Cyber stuff is good... Punk is good... Hmm cyberpunk... Why didn't I think of that?"
2,"...Read this book...Um, How about No.","First of all, let me state that I have never been a fan of science fiction. So, when I began reading this book I was probably bias in many ways. However, when I actually got into this novel, I realized that it was not my bias that was the problem; it was the book. The only way you can enjoy this story is if you are a computer techy, or if you happen to know the japanese language. I spent half of my time online looking for a freaking japanese dictionary so I could understand what the author was talking about. And, by the time I actually got back to the book, I had forgotten what I had previously read. If the author had provided a glossary of terms for incomprehensible language he used, then perhaps the story would have been easier to follow. But, he failed to do this and in the process lost much of his audience. Do not read this book if you do not have time to spend with it. Do not read this book if you value your sanity. In fact...just don't read this book."
1,A jargon-filled comic book,"Absolutely unreadable; I couldn't force myself farther than 100 pages into this morass. The ""story,"" such as it is, has all the depth and interest of a video game with pretentious techno-babble commentary. Worse yet, the book takes itself *so* seriously. There's not even the unintentional humor one sometimes finds in spectacular flops like _The Bridges of Madison County_ or _Plan 9 From Outer Space_. _Neuromancer_ is leaden and plodding; an absolute dud. This is the kind of book that leads people to erroneously dismiss science fiction as shallow, nerdy drivel."
2,Wait a minute! What just happened?,"This could have been a good book. It had likable characters with interesting backgrounds and it was filled with new ideas and storylines. What went wrong? I don't think the author was able to fully express those things through the writing. There was a lack of description when there was high action and sometimes no transition between scenes. I often found myself asking, ""What just happened?"" About halfway through the book I had to go to the Wikipedia entry for the book to find out what was going on. I think that shows an issue in how the book was written if the audience cannot understand what is happening. Maybe this story would be a better fit for a movie or a different author."
1,"An inexplicably overrated, awful pulp","I tried to read this book as I was lead to believe that it's similar to Philip K. Dick's writings. First time I could not progress further than about 50 pages. The writing was so awful, the story so forced, cliched- like a pretentious Barbara Cartland. But I tried again a few months later. I lasted to some love/sex scene, which made me laugh and throw this garbage away."
1,Awful.,"If you want to know how seriously this book should be taken, you have only to look at the kind of people who give it rave reviews. I'm afraid that an endless series of techno-jargon does not a novel make, and the fact that the jargon is never explained confirms the book's pretentiousness. When a new item of tech-terminology is introduced and not elaborated on, the reader can only conclude either that the author is being lazy or that he is hoping a simple-minded readership will assume that he knows better than them. The whole novel is suffused with the sensation of the author chancing his arm.Neuromancer is an uninteresting, unimaginative and ultimately daft book whose inexplicable popularity is just further evidence that the tendency to mistake opacity for profundity is becoming as common in fiction as it is in literary criticism. Truly dreadful."
1,I don't get it,"I read a lot...always have...but I just didn't get this book. When it was announced a special 25th anniversary edition, I had to read it.Read the whole thing, but have no idea what the heck was going on. Could not follow the story or the characters.I am not a (complete)idiot--professional degree and a lifetime of reading.Maybe its a generational thing, I don't know.Zero stars."
3,Cutting edge.,"W. Gibson's ""Neuromancer"" certainly deserves four stars for novelty. However, presenting novel ideas in understandable prose can be difficult, and this is where the book falls short. I've no doubt the author sees it all as very clear but it took this reader a little more effort than should've been necessary, and that stole some of the enjoyment from the read."
3,Neuromancer is like a peanut-butter wheat bread sanwich!,"Tasty but very dry.The tasty: Gibson tells a interesting story swirling elements from 2001, Bladerunner{the movie},and Naked Lunch into his very original book. The dry: His writing style ain't interesting at all. Reading this book was agonizing. Gibson wording is so dull it almost ruins a fine story."
3,Over-rated,"I couldn't help but think that Mr Gibson was hiding behind the futuristic mumbo-jumbo to prevent describing stuff that would actually make sense. While the overall theme made sense, too many details did not. Constantly using undefined terminology, and referring to things without describing them, might make the book ""mystical"", but doesn't make it particularly enjoyable."
2,Only children will be impressed,"Gibson admits to knowing nothing about computers, technology, science, politics, or much else, and it shows. Add to that his lack of writing ability, and you have a a lot of smoke and no fire. Still, it's better than anything Neal Stephenson or Oscar Scott Card ever wrote.."
2,Neuromancer: Worth its weight in Potato Chips,"After reading Gibson's Neuromancer, I will thoroughly disappointed with it. Although relativley well written, the novel jumps around a lot, and tends to lack focus in certain places. The character development is decent, although in a book that has been dubbed by some as ""one of the greatest novels ever written,"" it leaves a lot to be desired. For those of us who are not versed in cyberspace or such technology, we are alientated, and have trouble enjoying the book.The book's few redeeming qualities comes from its imaginitive story line. I think though, that it would take a true knowlege of the material dicussed (cyberspace, etc.) to truly enjoy it.This book is worth its weight in potato chips. However, you are interested, and i mean REALLY interested in the science fiction genre, this book may be for you. If you are not, don't waste your time."
3,Cyberpunk is just cyberpunk,"This book only rates three stars because it was written so long ago. The way he envisions the web is clever, but I find nothing new here. There are the same elements here as in every other cyberpunk book. The main problem is that it is overwhelmingly complex (I still don't understand why half the characters were added).What separates this book from any ohter cyberpunk book is beyond me. If you haven't fallen in love with the genre before, this one wont change anything."
3,Dated,"At the time it was written, it was probably a visionary book, but alot was lost on me reading it in 1998. Still a good book, but too splintered to be really satisfying."
2,Neuromancer,"I was disappointed with this book. The book had potential to be very interesting because of the subject matter. However I found that it had poor character development, the plot was rushed and the technology portion seemed to be over-emphasized."
5,The best cyberpunk book...,"This is the real cyberpunk. It's hard, it's cool, it's hi-tech. If you want to know cyberpunk, read this!"
3,Know your tastes before picking it up.,"The book is an enjoyable, quick read. It is not very fulfilling and sometimes even visually confusing. The sci-fi environment leaves many details to your own imagination. I'm not saying this is good or bad because it will vary depending on your tastes, but I prefer environments to be immediately recognizable and richly detailed.I would not recommend this book as your first sci-fi novel, and be particularly careful if you do not know much about computers or technical jargon."
4,I think I liked It! Did I? I don't really know. Or do I?,"I'm still confused about this book. I grabbed it because I liked the art on the cover (I know I know) It had an anarchic feel , a cool name and a swag of awards for some cred. What I ended up with is Case as some sort of graffiti artist, talented but aimless, bouncing from one strong personality to another, never really doing or accomplishing anything on his own. Things just happen to Case. This is either banal or brilliant, I'm still not sure. What I can tell you without any ambivalance is that this book makes an impact. I haven't read anything in a long time that leaves such a lasting impression of swirling images, personalitys and conflicts. Yeah I liked it"
4,Great book for Advanced Readers,"I had put off reading this book for two years because of the first two chapters. Gibson's style and literary prose are tricky to maneuver around. The plot itself if interesting, and I found it hard to put down after chapter three, but for computer techies, it might seem a little whacked. I would recommend it if your interested in not only technical cyberstuff but also an interesting view of society and mankind"
3,"Good, Not Great","This really is the gold standard of cyberpunk. Although Gibson's vision of the matrix is now sorely outdated in contrast to the web we know today, there are lots of cool sci-fi elements that remain fresh and inventive- many that the Wachowski Bros haven't yet shamelessly lifted for their movies.The noir-like story was fun, but was devoid of any real twists or suspense. The characters were interesting, but surprisingly shallow, the dialogue was somewhat dull, and the narrative scattered and superficial. I caught myself re-reading a lot of the text, where Gibson often jumped abruptly in and out of the story with dense techno jargon.Complaints aside, it was an enjoyable title. I'd place it well above Stephenson'sSnow Crash, not for writing style, but for story and vision. Not sure if I'll finish the Sprawl Trilogy, but Neuromancer is worth the read because of its well-deserved place in the history of science fiction alone."
2,"Vision, but not much else.","The plot was weak, really weak. Unfortunately, the characters were even weaker. They weren't that likeable, worse they just weren't very interesting either. It doesn't compare(in quality) to other cyperpunk books that I've read at all. Its one redeeming quality is that it was first"
2,This book is overrated,"I tried to read this book with the thought in mind that it was the first ""cyberpunk"" novel. Perhaps I could then consider it to have merit based on the fact that it was a pioneering work in the genre. Unfortunately, I found it extremely difficult to muddle through, and it seemed that the plot would often go nowhere. It still gets two stars, though, because there were certain scenes where Gibson displayed his potential talent as a word artist. Just about any novel by Philip K. Dick is more entertaining than this, though."
3,Dense and painful,"I'm impressed that Gibson wrote this in the early 80's, yet was able to describe the ""future"" so clearly. Amazing.I was excited about reading this book; however, I found it to be incredibly difficult to read and had to put it down midway through. I had no idea what he was writing about and it was hard for me to follow what was going on."
3,Plot driven ... not character driven,"I did like this book but I have to give it only 3 stars because I tend to enjoy books where I can get a little more intimate with the characters. I found myself indifferent towards the characters. If Case (the protagonist) would have died, lived, succeeded or failed, I wouldn't have been... affected. That is precisely what bothered me about this book. This is classic Cyber Punk and the world William Gibson creates is astounding and mind-bending, but if you tend to enjoy books that are more character driven than plot driven, Neuromancer may disappoint."
5,Essential item for any reader.,"You know how a real music afficianado owns at least a few items of each genre, usually the exceptional examples of say Jazz or Psychedelia, even though the person's personal preferences lean towards Fugazi?This book is for literary-minded tastes. It's the kind of science fiction that best exemplifies the mixture science *and* the fiction aspects of the genre, without compromizing either. The science is prognostic, the fiction is taut and addictive.Arguably, best of genre."
1,Chaotic,"I might be a little biased because I like fantasy more. I am a big fan if Warhammer 40k stuff though and since those aren't available on kindle I decided to branch out a little, bad choice. I don't think I made it halfway through this book. Didn't like the writing style or the story."
1,Highly Overrrated,"The birth of cyber punk and as well a book that has quite a following and is usually highly reccomended. I don't see why.I'm a huge tech geek and I love both cyberpunk as a genre and other types of fiction, but I found this book to be flat out terrible.While reading the book it just didn't seem interesting, it wasn't enjoyable. Add to the fact that this book is written in an absolutely absurb style that makes no sense.Bottom line, skip the book unless your on some sort of halucinetic drug... maybe reading it will be intersting then."
1,Proof that readers of Science Fiction need to grow up,"A completely boring, useless book. That it has become a classic proves that most readers of Science Fiction have no idea of what good writing is all about."
2,Lives not worth living,"Other reviews give a good sense of the concretes of this book, so I'll just mention what struck me as the fundamentals: the characters (and I do mean all of them) are pathetic: thieves and murderers; the setting is a dark, pointless future containing not a single real person with a real life; and the plot feels like a confusing tumble down a well. Although Gibson is intelligent and quite creative, he seems to enjoy creating difficult, jargony prose (muddying the waters so that they appear deep?). If this is one of the best in the cyberpunk genre, then the genre is not for me."
3,"Concept Amazing, Prose and Style Cloudy","Gibson's Neuromancer unveiled a new genre full of electronic inter-connectivity, cyberspace robotic communication, and cyborg like attachments for human consumption and use. The novel not only portended some of the devices that currently and in the future will no doubt exist, but gave a hint at a sparsely emotional, alien-like relationship between man, technology, and him/herself. This leaves the novel feeling incomplete and jumpy, as many of the concepts presented don't mesh with the current state of human relationships.The fact that the characters, their mission, their conflicts, and the overall plotline feel fragmented is no doubt a result of Gibson himself being a techno-nerd, cropping ideas from Hollywood and pulp magazines, without even experiencing them himself. Now if I could only teleport through Cyberspace to Shibuya or the Ginza and experience the modern day version of what this novel professes."
3,Dated,"I put off reading this book for at least 20 years. That was a mistake. Unlike many stories that depend mostly on plot and characterization for longevity, Neuromancer is a slave to the idea: a wired up future. Well, the vision was remarkably accurate in some respects, not so much in others. But regardless, that future is here now. So once you get past the comparisons between the vision and reality, you are left with a story that is not all that compelling. And, it suffers from a lot of techno-magic that is about as clear as the US budget. The tale does not end with any clarity and we still wonder about that AI we were hoping to see emerge. Guess that is just the way we are today in real life!"
2,"All style, no substance","William Gibson may have fathered the ""cyberpunk"" style with ""Neuromancer,"" I'll not get involved in that argument. But he has created little else with this novel. Neromancer sports clumsily created characters with little or no personality. (Unless cute speech characteristics count as personality.) Plot? For the first 1/2 of the book there is no plot...just a patchwork of picaresque scenes. Once Gibson finally decides to move the plot forward, he immediately falls into SF cliche.I was quite disappointed with this book, as I do enjoy Neal Stephenson's and Bruce Boston's works and decided to give the ""father of cyberpunk"" a try.I guess if great style is your thing (a la Tom Robbins or, dare I say :-) Robert Stone) you might get something out of this, but if real characters and an inventive plot are among the things you can't do without, pass this one by."
4,Neuromancer,"Neuromancer, was agood read a gritty vision of a possible future. The characters and background were alive and kept you interested."
2,A good story poorly written,"The plotline itself wasn't bad. However I found the book difficult to get through. The characters seemed rather 2 dimentional and unrealistic to me. So I didn't find myself caring what happened to any of them.A decent read if you are 12-15 years old, provided you don't take a lesson from the grammar."
2,Couldn't keep my mind from wandering...,"I never engaged with this book. I read fiction to transport myself out of my day to day world an into someone else's. Gibson's world in Neuromancer was dreadfully dull and grimy. The plot and characters were so disjointed that I started thinking about things I needed to do at work - or whether or not I fed the dog. It's time to put this book down and watch my fingernails grow.Yes, there are very cool and prescient concepts explored in this book. Gibson should be credited for his contributions to this genre. You can see he is a intuitive, creative and highly intelligent person... But, quite frankly, Neuromancer is just unreadable. After a 150 pages I just don't care about any of it. Yawn."
2,overrated,"I'm going to commit the unforgivable crime of a critique, not actually finishing the book. I admit I couldn't. I struggled with the horrendous style until page 80 (of 240), and then I couldn't any more. Maybe there is some magnificent plot and terrific character development from page 81 and onwards, but somehow I doubt it. The book is badly written, and no novelty of ideas could cover that up. It may have had its merit during the time it was written, and it may have an historic value of sorts, but it is not worth reading as a novel now. The style is not just annoying, it is almost infantile, sort of like a baby saying partial sentences, omitting verbs and other parts of the sentence. Maybe that's how he intended people to talk, but the descriptive parts are equally bad. And above all, it's a boring book. In short, a collection of ideas doesn't make a good SF novel, and certainly doesn't make it a classic (which apparently it has become."
3,takes its sweet time to get going,"Thing with NEUROMANCER is that there's a lot of cool stuff to think about and imagine in here, but some parts are a chore to read through, because the characters aren't really interesting in and of themselves, but for what they represent. For what they are rather than who they are, get it? And the lack of anything really human in here detracts. Maybe that's the point, that the AIs are more sympathetic than the humans in this world. But its 280 pages to get to that point, and occasionally it doesn't seem worth it. Definitely deserves the attempt, and it's always interesting, but not really *compelling* until the last 130 pages or so."
2,Meh,"Neuromancer was revolutionary for its time but the writing style is too chunky and showy and the plot boring. It didn't age well. I much preferred the sequels (Count Zero, Mona Lisa Overdrive) which have better flow. And the 'Bridge Trilogy' (minus All Tomorrow's Parties) is great fun, far superior to the first trilogy."
3,I Could Not Follow the Plot,"Honestly, I could not follow the plot (and wondered if there was a plot at all): is it just me, or is the novel really as incomphrensible as I think?Of course, I also find Tom Clancy incomphrensible, but for different reasons. Tom Clancy is just not readable (I think he's somewhat illiterate), but it's clear that William Gibson can put words together. There's a style and a polish to his writing, even though his vision is somewhat disorienting: I felt at times reading a lucid madman.Maybe I didn't focus enough on the book, but I don't think ""Neuromancer"" is the contemporary version of ""Paradise Lost,"" and there really wasn't that much to discover if I looked deeply. ""Neuromaner"" is after all a first novel, and it's a work by a young author who could not fully articulate his vision."
1,"A disjointed, rambling an joyless read","I picked up Neuromancer in the hopes of finding an author to complement Richard Morgan's brutal Kovacs series.I was not impressed.I found myself struggling to follow Gibson's prose in which the novel's main character's (an anti-hero that is impossible on any level to empathize with) interaction with reality is that of an angry child who had his toys taken away.While this novel may have been groundbreaking in the sense that it created cyber-punk, the genre has evolved to become something so much more than what Gibson originally created."
2,Predictable. I've read it all before...,"The characters are rehashed from a hundred other books and movies. After awhile the barrage of sameness becomes mind-numbing. Some of the situations kept me intrigued, but the predictability of the characters is what killed it for me."
1,The Worst Science-Fiction Novel Ever Writtem,"Hey! I've got an idea. Why don't I write a book in which I hide behind technological jargon so people have no idea what the plot is? These were the exact thoughts of Mr. Gibson as he contemplated writing this novel. The story is easily forgettable. What makes it even easier to forget this plot is that you can't rightly tell what the plot is. Someone clue me in, please. But for now, while all of you critically acclaim this book, I don't understand why."
2,a jigsaw puzzle with missing pieces...,"...P>Firstly, I expect any novel to have some degree of characterizations coherent prose, and a meaningful story. These attributes also apply to science fiction. True, a book like Neuromancer tries to ""push the envelope"" by diving into a story where reality as we know it is spun on its head. But I expect the author to help ease the reader into understanding his alternate reality. Mr Gibson seemingly chose not to do this, ... Reading Neuromancer is akin to completing a jigsaw puzzle without a completed picture to guide you, and in the end one discovers several pieces are missing. I assume Mr Gibson understands the complete picture. ... But I suspect many of them simply think that reading a 300 page novel full of AI/cyberspace/holographic gibberish is, by definition, ""way cool"". However I don't feel this way.Bottom line: I think I wasted several hours of my life reading Neuromancer. Not recommended."
2,"99% style, 1% story.","While I happen to think Gibson is vastly talented writer, he has this annoying tendency to keep re-writing the same story. I've read most of Gibson's work hoping to like him but find myself falling asleep. His style almost borders on the vindictive, though I find myself re-reading passages over and over again because he is a good writer. Gibson is a bit of a show off and a good one.I recommend his short stories. If you prefer the 'invisible' styles of Orson Scott Card and Philip K. Dick, I suggest you avoid this one."
1,S L O W,"I know this is supposed to be one of the cornerstones of cyberpunk, but I could not get thru this slow book."
3,Would like to give it more stars but...,"Was kind of hard to follow. Possible because I was reading two other books at the same time. I haven't been able to finish it yet but would like to.It did hold my interest for a while, but it was one that I could put down for long periods of time. I'll pick it up again someday."
5,There is only one equal to Verne,"and his name is William Gibson.Maybe the style of writing is not perfect, but content is what matters. I am reading it for fifth or so time and it is different then when I read it at age of nineteen.Just get it, and trust me, nobody remained indifferent."
4,read it over and over again,"i started bying the entire sprawl trilogy, read it through, and understood absolutely nothing of it...that is untill i finsihed mona lisa overdrive...and thereby found out how neuromancer was put togehter. This trilogy CANNOT be read one time, neither can you read just one of the books, you have to read them all to understand the true genious that put these three pieces of art together. currently i am reading neuromancer for the third time, and the story just keeps getting better and better.buy them all...read them all"
4,A Dysutopian Cyberdream,"The novel reads like a Raymond Chandler detective thriller on Russian Heroin (a drug frequently mentioned in Gibson's book). The characters are thin, but the physical environment and inner world of cyberspace are richly described. The plot moves along even as it takes you to unknown realms. This is an exciting read.This significant novel coined the work ""cyberspace"" and presaged the importance of the Internet when there was no Internet. (Nueromancer was written in 1984.) It also pointed to a morphing of humans and machines and drugs, something Ray Kurtzweil talks about in ""The Coming Age of Spiritual Machines.""Neuromancer is a great book, and by all means read it. But for a happier vision of the future, in addition to Kurtzweil's book mentioned above, I suggest ""Collective Intelligence"" by Pierre Levy.Collective Intelligence: Mankind's Emerging World in Cyberspace (Helix Books)Pulse: The Coming Age of Systems and Machines Inspired by Living Things"
3,Hard to follow,"Pretty good overall, but very difficult to follow. Contains many interesting futuristic concepts, though. I'll not be reading it again."
4,Great style,"This is written in a very poetic style. Gibson is a master at laying the setting and taking the reader on a voyage of discovery. The style of the writing may be difficult for some readers to follow, but it is definitely worth the read. It's very entertaining, and for a first novel, not bad at all. Any fan of SF must read this book. It is impossible to believe that this book was written in 1983. I do feel compelled to read this book again. This book won both the Hugo and Nebula awards."
5,Fast-Paced Technothriller,"This book was by far the most entertaining book I have ever read. Even Fifteen years after its publication it is still cutting edge and new. The symbolism and stark realism in the book is beyond simple writing and aspires to poetry. This book is the pioneer of modernday Sci-Fi, at least any of the good Sci-Fi. It is not only an action packed high strung thriller it is a view of the world, our world from a different perspective. Everything inside is what's to come and what is already here. This is not a look into a dark near future but a look into our own present day lives. Bravo William Gibson... I loved it."
5,"Excellent,","I think everything I wanted to say has already been said by everyone. I have a few tips however, for those who want to read the book: 1: Keep your concentration high. Read slowly and carefully. 2. Don't miss a single word: this can seriously affect your understanding of the novel.This book may be dense, but it isn't stupid!!"
3,Not a disaster movie.,"This movie, while is not a bad movie is not a disaster film either, if you're into a disaster thrill, this is not really that, the eartquake is not the center of focus in the movie,.. just a tool, the movie is around this bad guy and the FBI agent lady, Jeff Fahey plays the bad guy (for a change.) the trama has action, drama and a good ending, the title of the movie should not be 'Epicenter',but something more on the action hero theme,.. but the acting is quite good.!"
4,Pay attention to width!,"These were recommended by my podiatrist as an alternative to $400 custom insoles and to prevent future problems. The fit in all of my low profile flat shoes. They do cause imprints on the insole when it has some padding already.Pay more attention to width than size. I wear a 10 WW. I got the 8.5 -10 thinking it would be right, but needed the 11-12 size so the insole would be wide enough at the heal. If you are on the line and sometimes or usually wear a wide shoe you should go up a size."
2,Not the best,Very poorly made. Hurt my feet. Would not recommend. Material was of a plastic nature and did not fit in my shoes right.
2,Disappointed,"My Mom gave me some 3/4 superfeet insoles a few years back and they were awesome. These were not even close to being the same thing. What I received was longer, thinner and less supportive than the 3/4 superfeet I'd known and loved. These were also more narrow. I don't have a narrow foot but it's not crazy wide. My heels come over the edge in these. Tried wearing them for a day and the didn't help at all. In the end they were no better than the cheapo inserts from the grocery store."
5,Superfeet are super for my feet!,"If you have feet problems and need a good insert, these are worth trying out. Fairly inexpensive, they haven't warn out and they make your feet feel much better. I was diagnosed with Morton's Neuroma and plantar fasciitis. Both hurt like heck. After I had the podiatrist make me a fancy pair of inserts only to find that my feet didn't respond well to them, she recommended Superfeet! Best investment for my feet."
2,doesn't do any good.,not helpful and expensive for what it is.don't waste money on thisThe Super feet flip flop can help.
2,Uncomfortable and low quality,"I was surprised to find that this arch support is simply hard, molded plastic -- no flexibility or cushion whatsoever. It wasn't comfortable, and because the plastic has no grip, it slides around in my shoes. In my opinion, this is not worth the price, I am returning.I've found that Spenco insoles are a great alternative for half the price."
2,Its plastic - hard,I wanted to get a insole to support my flat shoes. it was not what i expected. Its hard plastic insole.
5,Love These--,"The Superfeet 3/4 Premium Insoles are fantastic. They come with Velcro attachments so that you can move them from one shoe to another. I use these in all of my summer sandals. Sandals are open, of course, and I didn't want a colored arch support to stand out more than the sandal itself. These, as I said, come with Velcro, you can put them in your sandals so they are secured and they hold your foot (you can see they have a raised heel area), support your arch and do not detract from the look of the shoe. I definitely recommend these for those of us that have flat or fallen arches. Go ahead, get them, and wear those open shoes supported and comfortable."
3,Not for wide feet!,"I tried these and the high heel inserts at a local store (Amazon has much cheaper prices, btw), and these were far too narrow for my feet. I wear size 11, but I usually have no problem with fitting into regular shoes. I do not need wide sizes, but the heel cup on these insoles was very uncomfortable. If you have wide feet at all, I would recommend the high-heel version instead. They work well for low shoes too, and in fact, I'm wearing them right now."
5,Lots of stability!,"My daughter likes ballet flats...the operative word being ""flat."" Those shoes have no support at all. With these inserts, her feet have more stability and support for her arches."
5,This is a great product and made my life tons easier!,"I didn't think that I should buy this after reading the reviews but my husband really wanted this one so I went ahead and bought it anyway. I got it yesterday and I could not be happier. I love this kettle! I have done so many things with it just in the two days I have owned it. It holds a ton of water. Boils the water in less than 2 minuets. Has a great feature that shuts it's self off after the water boils which is helpful to me and the handle is easy to pour with. If you are looking into buying one. You will love it! I use it to make coffee in a press, Raman noddles, jello, tea, soup, and even to boil water for cooking! I could not be happier!"
3,Bodum Bottom for Curl Fails,"Though the Bodum Curl is a convenient water heater and server, its mating lower power source bottom onto which the top water container sits eventually fails. Ours failed within a year, during daily use. When one-half of a system fails, though (in this case) the top is still usable, the entire unit has to be replaced. Becauses of the delicacy of the contacts within the lower power unit, repair is seldom possible.It would be an instance of great customer service if Bodum would sell the lower power unit separately as a replacement item.In contrast, my six-year-old Superior (UK) electric teakettle, also used daily, still works flawlessly.Which do you think is the better value?"
4,"Adventure, Love & Romance","This is the love story that we only dream about. It is an easy read that will keep you glued to the pages. Mr. Graves makes you feel that you are right there with the characters, wherever they are. It will bring out the hidden romantic in you."
3,Lion and the Black,"I thought that Lion and the Black was an entertaining, easy reading book. I wasn't thrilled with the romance aspect of it-a little too sappy for my tastes. Some of the charcters were too perfect, not flawed enough for me to see them as real people. I did however enjoy the portions of the book that were in Bogta and the rainforest. The scenery was vivid and the plot intriguing. I also liked the descriptions of the Pacific Northwest due to the fact that I grew up and continue to live here. I was able to recognize some of the areas described and that was kind of fun. All in all, if you're into romances you will probably enjoy this book very much, if you're not into romance novels it is still an entertaining book to read to pass the time."
4,Pleasantly surprised...,"Being a voracious reader of Stephen King, Anne Rice, and anumber of different science fiction authors, I was more than a bitshocked to find how much I enjoyed this novel, as it's definitely not my usual fare. It starts a bit slow, but then the momentum picks up and is carried on throughout the rest of the novel. Kirk was able to capture the aura of beautiful Seattle as well as gave me the ability to care about what happened to the main characters through his touching portrayal of Rachel and David.. kudo's! :)"
4,A book you won't drop.,"Allow me to be succinct, as Kirk is. The style is terse, the story is fast-paced. You won't get bored, you won't want to stop, you'll yearn to know what's on two pages later when you've just started that first page. You'll want to meet these characters, you'll want to decipher reality from fiction, as these two intertwine even within the story. It seems unreal at first, the love of the two persons, then you get this hit of reality--and I'm not spoiling this for everyone. Read the book, feel for it, for it's thought-provoking as well as enchanting. Sit tight and enjoy this thrilling ride. Kirk's ways are engrossing. And once you're done, something persistant sticks. Kirk Graves--we can only pray that a flow of stories of love, conflict, loss and peace will come... Be ready for the next wave."
4,Lion and The Black,"I picked this book up to read a few lines or so until I would be entertained by a family get together. I found my self, embarassingly ignoring the party that assembled, by not putting the book down and joining in. I guess the biggest reason was the unusual twist that Kirk implanted in the (accident). You just have to read the story to see that you won't be able to put this book down."
1,"contrived, almost painfully so",The story was painfully contrived. I could almost tell what was going to happen next. The characters were weak. There was no spark of romance. It was unreal. People don't fall in love with people they have only fantasized about. There was no ambiance of Seattle or the Northwest. When I pick up a Nora Roberts book I feel transported away to whatever locale and into the lives of her characters. There was no feeling of escape to this story. I kept asking myself why keep reading it. I read another book before I finished it. I probably wouldn't have finished it if I hadn't been home sick with the flu and didn't have another book. I won't be looking for the next one.
1,a bland disappointment,"The locales were inviting. The concept of the book was intriguing. However, once I started reading the book, the bland, thinly written characters did not keep my attention and I could not finish the book. A potentially interesting concept was poorly executed by the author."
3,Slow to start... but gets better and better,The book was a bit slow to start and the characters lacked an emotional appeal that pulls you in... but stick in there it picks up and is worth the effort to read!
1,lion and the black not even minimally exciting,"Romance, adventure and exotic locales sounded good for a quick weekend read. I was disappointed, it was painful to read the dull dialogue between the characters who are flat and under-developed. Similarly, descriptions of various locales didn't inspire the imagination. I won't be reading the series."
4,Lion & the Black,As an avid reader of romance and adventure novels I was pleasantly surprised by the unpredictability of this story. The writer's style is easy to follow and once I got started I couldn't put it down. Pages turned themselves. The story-line was one I had never seen in a novel.This book would make a great movie! The love story and the adventures and travels of the main characters would be fun and exciting on screen. This isn't your typical love story but instead is rife with peril.Excellent book.
3,A Romance Story For The Ages,"This is a story that can find a place amongst both the Adventure stories on his nightstand and the Romance novels on hers. But the most surprising part to me was how the story worked as an allegory to Christianity. The Lion (of Judah?) is seeking a special woman (a people or a church?) with which to establish a special relationship. Along the way, people are constantly calling to him for help- for protection, for lifesaving situations, for dealing with life threatening illnesses and the Lion always comes to their aid. The final triumphal scenes seem like a parable or perhaps a prophecy one might find in Revelation. And while I may have been reading a stirring passage in a romance novel, my mind began treating these characters as symbols for larger, universal entities and constructs. A very interesting experiment by the writer who seems to be trying to answer the Joan Osborne question ""What if God were one of us?"""
3,Some GEMS but overall just OK,While i do recommend this purchase for any big fan of Maiden i was a little disappointed. What is clear is that Maiden is better at writing their own material than doing cover songs. My favorite thing about the CD was being able to hear the exact style of the songs compared to the years in which they were written. That Girl and Kill Me Ce Soir are incredible tracks. There are also great live versions of Remember Tommorow and Wasted Years. I would suggest getting this just don't anticipate every song to be a masterpiece like i did.
3,Cd only?,Cd's only in plain white sleeves. If your looking for collector case or bio sleeve don't buy this one
4,"Respectful Tone, Informing Christians About Islam","This is intended to inform Christians about the basic tenets of Islam, what the key differences are between Christian and Islamic beliefs, and how a Christian might dialogue with a Muslim. Several Muslim scholars and leaders are interviewed to provide an accurate account of what Muslims believe. Dr. Timothy George, a Christian scholar, provides most of the commentary in the films, and he emits a gentle, repectful tone, even though he strongly disagrees with most of Islam's tenets. Dr. George also explains Christian beliefs very well. Why I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 is because I believe Dr. George had too much face time in the film, and some segments seem too prolonged. But all in all, I think it is a good introduction to Islam for Christians, mainly because of the respectful tone."
3,good but not for the classroom,As a teacher I was hoping to use this DVD to help with some lessons to Muslim students on some of the doctrines of christianity compared with those of Islam but it was a bit boring. It would have been more interesting had the Muslims responded to Dr. George's teachings and it be more like a debate or different presentations rather than Dr. George spending 20 minutes teaching the Christian position. I also think it was too expensive for one cd which does not offer much to help in the classroom with secondary students. I wish someone would make a dvd similar to this but more exciting for students.
1,"Very strange book, useful for historical purposes only","Here is an explanation of the difference between gustar and agradar:""Vemos a una mujer fea. No nos gusta. Pero la tratamos, nos habla, la oímos, observamos sus ademanes, respiramos el ambiente especial de que parece rodearse aquella mujer; creemos divisar en su frente cierto resplandor a través de la fealdad de su semblante, y nos agrada.Para que una mujer logre gustar, basta generalmente que sea hermosa. Para que consiga agradar es necesario que tenga una cara detrás de la cara de carne.""The rest of the dictionary is equally weird. As I said in the title, its only value is to show the state of what passed for lexicography in 1885 in Spain."
1,A real disappointment,"I got this product for Christmas; it is either defective or of very poorly quality. It worked fine juicing the first 3-4 oranges, but after that, the motor couldn't seem to cope with any sort of actual pressure--it seemed like it just wasn't powerful enough. The ""two-way rotation"" feature is a total crock as well..."
2,weak,"Not enough juice to get juice! This machine isn't powerful enough to fully juice a half lemon. Not really worth the price, better off with a hand operated powerful one."
3,A Lot May Happen in One Hour,"This book has a Stephen King type of flair. It consists of the bazaar, magic, vampirism, and walks the line of life versus suicide and death. There are short stories and poems, of which some intertwine. Fantasy is not easily identifiable with reality and gives one a feel of walking in the twilight zone. ""One Hour"" is unlike any book that I've read before as it delves into the mind of madmen seeking peace, but not sure how to accomplish it. Where does fantasy ends and reality begin??? This book leads one to believe that it is in the mind of the beholder. Mr. Sullivan, I will be anxiously awaiting your next book."
1,The game would not play on my XP computer,My XP computer well exceeds the minimum system requirements needed for this game but it would not play. It loaded with no trouble but when I hit the play button a screen full of garbage appeared and the whole computer froze. I could not even more the cursor. I had to unplug my computer from the wall socket. Despite extensive help from eGames the same problem recurred again and again. I was never able to play the game so I cannot recommend this game to anyone. It is a waste of $25.00.
1,"Bad graphics, a waste of money","This game has really poor graphics which annoyed me so much I bought a different mah jong game and never play this one. the software has a ton of different tile sets and layouts, but the graphics are of such bad quality that the game is unplayable."
2,Not as much as I expected,"This came has an abundance of bells and whistles and has many pleasing choices in game setup that others do not offer. The main drawback is the lack of flexibility in the game itself. I hoped to build levels and be able to graduate from one level and move up and up to reach a highest record score. Instead, each level is a time trial and is measured only against the level itself."
5,Answer to the previous comment,"As the author of MahJongg Master 5 (Deluxe Suite), I wanted to point out that I'm surprised by the comment below. What is this about?<a href=""http://kyodai.com/i/actual.jpg"">This kind</a> of graphical setup can be reproduced in MJM5, which is approximately based upon the same version of Kyodai Mahjongg as on this screenshot.If these are bad graphics, I don't know what you're asking for.Even by today's standards, MJM5 (which was released years ago) still looks good and is pleasant to play. Actually, more people tend to criticize MJM6 (which is not based on KMJ) for being a bleak imitation of MJM5.I'm not a salesman. I just couldn't accept, as an author, that this would be the only Amazon.com comment on my work. I'd appreciate if people could actually look through all of the available graphical themes before judging. Or if you want to judge the game by today's standards, then do it for the <a href=""http://kyodai.com/"">latest version</a> -- and only that one. Thank you."
5,MahJongg Master Deluxe Suite,"I have enjoyed this game as well as all of the computer games that I have purchased. In the future can you send me an updated list or what ever of your new computer games of this calibar and or catergory to me, I would very much appreciate it. Thank you again.Menya Liddell"
3,Not what I thought...,"I was hoping for more medicine ball based movements...instead, it felt more like aerobics with a ball in your hand."
5,Fun - Tough - Results!,"I never knew you could do so much with a simple medicine ball. It's such a creative and effective workout. Patrick coaches and motivates you through many challenging moves. By halftime, I was drenched with sweat and my muscles were feeling the burn. PLAYBALL definitely helped me lose pounds and get toned!!"
5,A Must Have ...,"I have both the mini & full-sized kettles, I use the mini size @ work & the full-size @ home (all electric high-rise).They last a long, long time as long as you use them properly (fill to cover coil especially important).One thing to note, I try to use either warm or hot water when boiling to speed up the heating process (but hardly a slow kettle to begin with). Also, bottled/filtered water results in less mineral deposits on the coil & further prolongs the life."
2,NOT SATISFIED,"THE BRACELET IS VERY PRETTY, BUT IS NOT AS THICK AS PICTURED. ITS PIC MAKES IT LOOK STURDIER BUT IT IS ACTUALLY VERY DAINTY."
5,Soil's best album,"Soil's first album, ""Scars"", was really solid and made me an instant fan of the band. Their second album, ""Redefine"", was also good, but in my opinion, not as good as the first, lacking the aggression present in ""Scars"". The only flaw with ""Scars"" was that each song sounded like the others, and there wasn't much variety musically. The new release, ""True Self"", takes the aggression of ""Scars"", but fixes the problem of repetitive sounding songs, making this their best album so far. The new vocalist AJ Cavalier sounds a lot like the previous singer Ryan McCombs, but AJ has more grit in his voice and more intensity than his predecessor. If you liked ""Scars"" more than ""Redefine"", you will love ""True Self""."
2,Sad i must say!,"Ok so everyone by now knows that Ryan the former lead singer of Soil is now with Drowning Pool which will in hopes make their new cd live up to their first. I have to say that when i first heard Give it Up i was excited because the song remeinded me why i liked Soil but shortly there after the cd became nothing more then a blur and pretty much boring. The only songs really worth anything on the cd are Give it Up, True Self and One Last Song but other then that this Soil cd is worth nothing more than a good frisbee on a bad day!!!"
2,Disappointed,"This was a polarizing CD for me compared to previous efforts. I'm having a hard time adjusting ot the new singers voice.I do really like tracks 4 & 5 (The Last Chance & True Self).The rest of the tracks I just couldn't get into.Sadly, this might be my last Soil purchase but there is a silver lining.The latest Drowning Pool CD is worth a listen if you've liked previous Soil releases. That is where singer Ryan McCombs is at now.I wouldn't say that DP is as good as the previous Soil efforts but it is good and shows promise. There is a ray of hope for even better rock to come!"
5,Metal Music Madness,Last night I had the pleasure of seeing Soil live in Atlanta Georgia where they were opening for Mushroomhead and let Me tell you that this band is going places despite any difficulties they may have in the past. I bought this cd straight from the merchandise vendor and listened to it on the ride home from the concert and it was almost as good as watching them live. If you're a diehard underground and mainstream metal fan you'll love this cd and all of their others. The only thing that sucked about Soil at the show is that their merchandise sold so quick after their set that I couldn't buy all of their cds so here I am at good old Amazon to order every cd they have ever produced instead!Mistress Malice
3,Back (Sort of),"Well here we go with the new just about everything soil album, first of all replacing a singer like RM is always going to be nigh on impossible to do and I have seen the band live on several occasions, I can say that live they were better before and on record they are well........not as good unfortunately as before.Still this record has ""moments"" of some great work on it. I just cant help thinking that with RM still in the picture this disc would have been so much better.I think that if you never heard the old soil you would think this is great but if you did hear the old stuff it aint what you wanted."
1,Very biased against Turks,"I am a Kurdish Turk and I know quite well how Turks can treat minorities, and like many empires Turks have been quite violent as well. The most powerful has always been the most violent. Ottomans, English, Germans, French and now USA. When I was reading this book, I got a sense of deep hatred against Turks, Christopher hitchens tries hard to hide his hatred agains Turks but he fails."
4,a must read for a free thinking spirit,i read this book to begin my quest to read everything by the author hitchens. i know very little about cyprus so i cannot argue any points written by the author. im new to his style of writing but i admire his courage to put forth a different notion and expose the conventional way of thinking because it takes more work to do so.
1,Propaganda disguised as historical account,"What is there to say about this book? Any serious reader of history will very quickly recognize this for what it is - an account of a conflict told from the perspective of one side. The attempt to make it appear impartial is quite pathetic. Well, at least he admits that he undertook the project in a fit of anger - it shows! I am really sorry I spent money on this book."
3,No snow!,"The letter was very cute...my daughter loved all the details included about her friend and her hobby, and even her dog. I, however, didn't appreciate that I had to email the company after it hadn't been sent a week after the date I specified, AND it didn't include snow. I mean, I live in Texas, and the main reason I decided on this Santa letter was so my daughter would get a kick out of snow from the North Pole. (as I said, we're Texans, and wouldn't know real snow from confetti) So, while she loved it, I was disappointed it wasn't everything it said it would be."
4,Up and Comer,"This CD is great and the only thing better than listening to this and laughing with friends is listening to him live at a Texas bar. He writes songs that anyone who has ever failed at loving someone(always) or just wanted to stop loving someone(I don't feel that way) can relate to. Barlight is a catchy, clever drinking song, and good neighbor is a cerebral song about celebrity. I can't wait for the new one."
5,Learning to dance made easy,This easy to follow book will have you dancing like a pro in no time.Steps are well illustrated in timeless graphics. If you need to learn the basic steps of the most popular ballroom dances this book is a must.
1,Characters of the Inquisition is better.,"Walsh writes a anti-Semitic screed, distances himself from his own argument in subsequent writings, and still some readers cling to this volume and ignore his retraction. Walsh seems a sincere Catholic, able to subject his thought to scrutiny, and then to change, which is deeply admirable. We should all follow his example by ignoring this book and purchasing Characters of the Inquisition, a much more enlightened tome."
1,bias,walsh is too bias as he is a catholic and puts forward his own opinion rather than fact and does not use very good language in the sense of literature he is also clearly anti jewish and involves his personal religion too much and rubbishes anything non catholic and does not even state clearly why and does not give it a fair trial
3,Savannah's Ghosts,"This book was a bit interesting to read, but did not cover a lot of places in Savannah like the Haunted Savannah book did. Most of the places in the Savannah's Ghosts book, people would normally not go to visit. I plan to donate this book to the local library."
2,the only thing frightening about this book is the writing,"I wasn't really impressed with this book at all. It's poorly written, filled with numerous typos, deals with only a few hauntings, has no pictures of supposed hauntings or ghostly phenomena, and contains umpteen digressions where the author discusses his beloved Christian faith. A real disappointment."
2,Questionable cost and suspiciously written.,"I had visited Savannah in 2002 and had picked up the author's first book(?) ""Danny's Bed"" which was either a far fetched fantasy or an amazing real deal group of occurences but I feel doubtful of the latter. But willing to give the benefit of the doubt I moved on to this 2nd book way of Amazon and after having read it felt his second had yet to redeem the first. It suffers from poor editing, poor image reproduction and questionable image use. The stories are so so and I felt the print quality of it didn't justify the price whatsoever in the end. I did happen to also buy another book called ""Savannah Spectres"" on Amazon and found this one hit more of a mark on research, plausibility and value."
1,Not so clear,"These labels are not clear, they may work on white paper but for cream and light colors they don't work."
2,Smeary and Opaque Labels,"These should be called Avery Not-So-Easy Peel Opaque Address labels. I bought them for DIY wedding invitations. I had purchased custom return address labels that were completely clear and easy peel and great from another online source. Then I purchased these and the labels didn't seem to match with the return address labels because they are more translucent than clear. Also the ink was really smeary coming through the laser printer. I had to run through a whole bunch of sheets before getting it right. And on top of that, the Avery program in word to make the labels makes it hard to put more than three lines in any square. I don't think I'll use them again."
4,Good but not great,"For some reason, my laser printer liked to eat these labels despite my best effort to keeping it from doing so. I still gave them four stars because they will most likely work just fine for you."
5,just what I wanted!,I have spice containers that are clear and these labels are perfect for labeling them. I can read what spice is in the containers as well as see the spices inside.
3,Interesting.,My sister in law recomended Jim Gills music. We haven't gotten into it yet but my daughter is only 15months old. Perhaps when she can understand it we will enjoy it more.
5,Wonderful Children's CD,Jim Gill has put together an terrific selection of songs for kids in this CD. I highly recommend it!
4,Fun for moving and dancing!!,This is such a fun CD for young children. The songs are silly and create opportunities for fun movements and lots of laughs.
2,Mexican Restaurant Muzak,I was thoroughly unimpressed with this cd. Most of the music sounded like the stuff you hear piped through the speakers at cheap Mexican restaurants or like it was from a cartoon- not the kinds of music that inspire you to dance! Skip this one for sure.
2,Only broadly useful,"There's so much to learn about Applescripting, and the learning curve so high, that a ""Visual Quickstart"" approach is promising -- albeit a disappointment. After a straightforward introduction, expert Ethan Wilde leads us through a number of detailed scripts for use in apps like Filemaker and your browser. However, this book cannot be called a tutorial in any true sense of the word, and anyone looking for a reasonably comprehensive guide (as in Visual Quickstart's excellent volume for HTML 4) should look elsewhere. Several useful links for future learning are provided, but through no fault of the author, the carefully explained examples may not be relevant to even a plurality of users. Both OS9x and OSX are explored; given the limitations of space, this only further dilutes the final result."
2,Not exactly what I hoped,"This book deals not so much with a broad understanding of Applescript as much as it does how to do some basic things in different applications. The introductory section is great, but some of the really needed things for folks doing real automation, like creating and saving files under multiple names, printing files to multiple printers or appending files are not even touched. The examples are given good context, which is a plus, but I'm not sure this title was worth the cash, especially since a lot of the application titles have new versions out."
2,Not very helpful,"Unclear if my problems learning AppleScript from this book stem from the book itself or from the language.Programming concepts are very faintly discussed. Should you, the reader, ever dare to diverge from recipes in the text, you'll have to search online to find more thorough discussion of the language. And then, you'll be sifting through all the tutorials that date from pre-OS X.Seek another book if you can find one, or better yet, stick to a real programming language like Perl."
4,Not a Horror Film...,"...per se. This should appeal more to fans of drama/suspense.If you're like me and enjoy indulging in films that watch like paperback novels, then this should do it for you. The DVD cover is a bit misleading-- this is about a strong-willed, stubborn woman who decides to sail around the world with no human contact save via radio.During the trip, cabin fever sets in and she confronts her past and fears through ghostly visitors which include her parents and some pirates.This picture provides the viewer with some great drama, interesting characters, and an overall satisfying cinematic experience. If it was meant to be scary, it failed (except for the chick's mom-- she was freaky), but shines as a psychological drama.Check it out if it sounds like your thing."
2,Not worth it,"We were looking for a mic to use for our stage plays and we thought that this could be the solution to our tight budget. The kids have to be very close to the mic for them to be heard. That defeats the purpose of getting these hanging microphones. It was a mistake buying this one, save your money and get something else."
4,CLEANER THAN CLEAN,"Here's good news for the guys from Bullie, a skin care line offering cleansers, moisturizers, post-shave toners, and scrubs. A botanically based line geared to help men look their best, Bullie offers products for three skin types: All Skin Types; Normal/Oily Skin, and Dry/Sensitive Skin.

The cleanser for Normal/Oily Skin contains papaya enzymes and silk amino acids which serve to gently exfoliate but not irritate the skin."
5,"Great headset, Excellent value","I researched many Bluetooth headsets, including the Tekkeon, for several months prior to my purchase. The Tekkeon replaced my older Jabra FreeSpeak that I had used for the previous 18 months. The battery life of the Jabra was suspect and it always failed at the worst times. The Tekkeon is more comfortable and lighter, and the battery life has exceeded my expectations. It had no problem pairing with my Blackberry 7100t from T-mobile and has great range. The charger conveniently plugs directly into the headset. I don't use the over the ear clip and while it looks like the headset wouldn't stay in, it does very well. All the buttons are convenient and easy to use. This is an excellent headset. For other reviews, you can check out: (...)"
2,Careful!,"Just bought this based on glowing reviews here. On first use, found that the slightest wind noise (ie, the breeze from walking forward while talking outside) is picked up in the other caller's ear, and prevents their voice from coming through. Seems to be much more sensitive to wind noise than the Moto 850 (which has such low max volume capability that I bought the Tekkeon in hopes of replacing it). Works fine indoors, but so far it's unusable outside."
1,Save Your Money,"This bluetooth headset may very well be the best headset...for anyone sitting completely motionless in a sound-proofed room while not breathing. For everyone else, the ezTalker is useless. Aside from the poor audio quality through the ear piece, which is scratchy and inconsistent with regards to volume; the slightest breeze or trace of moving air is enough to completely overwhelm the microphone. People on the receiving end will be convinced you have either stepped into a wind tunnel, or perhaps you have suddenly been struck with emphyzema. This also extends to voice activated calling, which becomes little more than standing in acorner hiding from the wind and screaming the same three words over and over causing everyone nearby to move asiduously away from you. The only positive note is the excellent battery life, which is about 9-10 hours of use or about 48 hours of standby."
3,"2 yrs max, but cheap","This still works, but I have to weigh the handle down with a can-opener or heavy thing of the sort. It was fine, great for the 1st year, then the weiging began. My English husband won't let me buy another one until this dies completely, but I would not get another one. My mother in law has had the same electric kettle for 10 years. Still works fine (she lives in the UK, though, where everyone has one).For 20 bucks, it is fine (I paid much more for it) so, for 10 bucks a year, you are ok. better than a stove top if you want a cuppa."
1,As Advertised: But didn't Last Long,"This was great while it lasted. It just didn't last very long. I had it about 2 or 3 months when it stopped heating. Not a very good record. I think ""One Star"" is too much for 3 months of work."
1,NOT the perfect solution,"I apologize to anyone who saw my earlier review for this item - only today, when I recieved the second one I'd ordered, did I discover that I was mistakenly sent the full-size cordless Ibis when I ordered this mini-version a while back. The full-size version I still recommend 100%. That is the one that is pictured above (for the teal option). But this one (the mini) appears pretty useless, and is certainly NOT going under the Xmas tree this year, I'm getting the full-size one right now. Go check that one out by searching for ""Ibis Cordless""."
1,Safety,"I just got this water heater from a relative. Probably thought it would come in handy in my dorm room. But, I don't think he remembers that heating plastic, then ingesting/touching the plastic is good. You know how you shouldn't put plastic containers in the microwave, because touching the softened plastic and ingesting the food that's absorbed the softened plastic is, over time, carcinogenic? Same reason why I will not be using this water heater. I have my own small immersion heater. It's basically a heating mechanism (pretty similar to the one in this plastic heater) that you put in a safe(glass, ceramic, etc.) container with water in it, plug it in and it boils the water. Easier to clean off any grime on it too."
2,Great until it fails,"I have now owned three of these and love them as long as they work. Unfortunately two of them have failed, the last after just a couple of months. In each case the switching mechanism failed, making it impossible to use. The third pot, which has not failed, I think may be protected by the fact that I use it much less as it is in a second home. I won't buy another."
2,Works like a charm -- when it works,"My husband bought me one of these two years ago for Christmas. I was ecstatic, because I love tea and was sick of boiling water in the microwave for it. This kettle worked great -- for about 10 months. Then one morning, with no warning, the kettle gushed water from the bottom when I filled it.We returned the kettle to Bodum for a replacement, as it was still under warranty. The replacement kettle would not attach to the heating element. We sent it back and got a second replacement. It has worked well -- for about 10 months, when the automatic switch mechanism failed. We had to start watching the thing like a hawk to take it off the element when it reached a boil (we can't shut the switch off manually because it doesn't work). Now, this morning, it just didn't turn on at all.The kettle is STILL under warranty, so we could return it for a new one, but we're giving up and trying a different brand."
5,A little trooper,"I bought mine in the summer of 1997 and I just tossed it out last week. It cost me around 20 bucks new and saw daily service. It was still working when I tossed it, but the electrical connection was getting flaky and it wouldn't automatically shut off any more. It no longer could be left on the base when not in use, as it would remain on and boil dry; it became a fire hazard.While it was in service I never had a bad thing to say about it - it boiled quickly, the plastic body got only warm to the touch - never too hot. And - I think this is important - it poured well. It was accurate, didn't spatter or overpour, didn't dribble. So, for 2 bucks/year I think it was a terrific value and I give it 5 stars.I'm giving serious consideration to buying a replacement Bodum kettle, but since we're redoing the whole kitchen, I'll probably go with something stainless and more sculptural - and just hope that it performs as well as my trusty Bodum!"
2,Not What I Expected...,"If you would like a tiny little water kettle for your office, this product may be for you. However, it wasn't for me; and I'll tell you why.1. From the picture, it looks like the mini-kettle will dislodge from a base. It won't--you have to pour the contents with the cord attached.2. The kettle feels lightweight, fragile and awkward--like it will tip over and spill at any second.3. Removing and replacing the safety lid is an annoying chore.4. The heating element actually touches your water in the containment unit.Basically? The product feels cheap."
1,faulty switch,"I have had an earlier bodum kettle which worked great for 6 years. It finally wore out so I bought a new one online. It lasted a month before the switch stopped working. I called customer ""service"" who said ""I feel bad, but theres nothing I can do unless it fails within one month."" Mine failed and it seems from a quick google search that lots of other peoples have failed too. Beware of this kettle and read the fine print"
1,"Too small, not cordless, not easy to use.","Before you buy the mini ibis, make sure you understand that it's very very small: it's sized to boil water for ONE.Also it's not cordless, which I personally find inconveniant.Also it has a heating element that is directly in contact with the water - the ""old style"" - not like the new electric kettles with a devider between the element and the water.Also the ""locking lid"" is not comfortable to use and looks like not so high quality.Instead, get the GREAT T-Fal 4-cup Vitesse High Speed Kettle. I use it at work, it is very very good. or for a bigger version go for the Vitesse 7-Cup."
2,The Warrior's Game,The quality of this book was below stated condition. I will not buy again!!!!!!! Sticker on book stated .99 while I was charged over three times that amount and book was at sticker value or less.
4,"Politics,money,power,and now art in Russia",This is Russia today.Now I can understand the daily news happenings.Farenheight 911 is to USA as Tycoon is to Russia.This picture should be required course in schools.I wish some of the scarface antics would be easier for me to follow.
4,This was a very good book,"I recommend this to students and teachers because it was a very good book. This book is about a Japanese teenage boy in Feudalk Japan. His mother died and he is on a journey to find his father. The only thing he knows about his father is that he was a samurai and he had a chrysanthemum tattoo on his shoulder. When he goes to find his father, he encounters many things. If you like adventure books, then you should get this."
5,"A wonderful, heart-warming story!","This is a wonderful story about an orphan boy in feudal Japan who searches for his samurai father but ends up finding himself instead. I teach 7th grade, and my students LOVE this book! It was the only book all year that even my lowest students enjoyed reading. Don't miss it!"
2,Not the Novel we expected...,"My seventh grade English class found this Novel to be difficult to understand and enjoy. Not only did they find this Novel dry and rather boring, but also confusing. Although we discussed the details surrounding Muna, his father--a samurai warrior with a chrysanthemum tattoo on his arm, and the wars between the Genki and Heike clans, is was difficult for my students to really plunged themselves into this book. All in all, they couldn't wait to finish.Each year I assign this Novel I notice the same results: students seem to lack interest in the characters and adventure. Unlike Beowulf, by Robert Nye, Sign lacks a really ""hero."" The amoral and seemingly selfish acts of Muna allow the reader few feelings other then pity. Indeed, an excellent alternative to this Novel would be The Giver."
3,The Sigh of the Chrysanthemum,"This story is about a boy named Muna. When his mother dies, Muna goes in search for his fater, but finds many obsticals in his way. This story was not to bad, but it had it's confusing parts. Reviewed by David G."
2,Definatly not the best book in the world....................,"I didn't like this book very much. I like the fact that it took place in feudal Japan. The rest of the book could definatly be better. The book also leave a lot of loose ends. Like what happened to certain characters and if they are sure what some people said is true. The book was about a boy named Muna. At first Muna doesn't like his name because it means ""no name"". His mother recently passed away and he is look for his dad, a big tall samurai. His mom also told him that his dad has a tatoo of a chrysanthemum on his shoulder. Muna meets a guy named Takanobu. Takanobu takes care of Muna on thier way to the capital. Then there is a fire and Takanobu dies. Then he meets a swordmaker named Fukuji. Fukuji takes care of him for a year. But then .........oh no!! I said too much. You have to read the book to find out what happens."
2,This book was poorly written.,"I didn't really enjoy reading this book. I thought the story was pretty boring and that some parts of the story was confusing. Like did Muna really find his father? Was Takanobu his father? I don't know because I got confused at that part of the story. I think the author should of wrote this book less confusing so I or others that got confused could of understood parts of the story better. Steven Yum, ASI"
2,"Mediocre, at best","_Sign of the Chrysanthemum_ is a halfhearted stab at _Johnny Tremain_, set in feudal Japan. Again, young lad searches for his identity and his father. Again, young lad is swept up in political events beyond his understanding. Unfortunately, the writing is nowhere near as vivid, nor are the characters nearly as sympathetic in _Sign_.There's got to be a better look into feudal Japan for young readers than this."
3,THE SIGH OF THE CHRYSATHEMUM,"To me, this is one of those books you would just only like to read once. I'm a scince-fictional kind of person, so i didn't really like this book. It was ok, because it had warriors and swords.The book was about a young boy searching for his samuri father, and looking for the sign of the chrysathemum on the man. I would recomend this book to anyone who just loves to read a book for fun."
3,Addictive Old West action,"Don't read this book....unless you're prepared to read the ton of otherbooks in the ""Smoke Jensen and Preacher"" series. This author writes a bookbefore breakfast and another just before dinner. They're plentiful andhighly addictive. Suspend belief and enjoy.Smoke Jensen, in particular, shoots or fist fights around a hundredhard cases per book and they all highly deserve the mayhem he delivers.In spite of this high fiction (most famous old West gunfighters onlykilled 3 or 4 men in their entire lives) you'll soldier on with theseries because Smoke Jensen is the stuff heros are made of and thewriting is crisp and moving.Just don't say you weren't warned when you find that you spent your wholesummer (or winter) in a comfy chair with 50 or so of these read booksstrewn around you."
3,no longer relevant,"Goodness knows why you would ever want to purchase this travel guide, now that it's several years out of date and probably extremely tough to get a hold of. If, however, you do buy this guide, you should be aware that the country has simmered down greatly since it was written and researched. While there is still some banditry, by and large the country is a pleasant and tame area in which to travel. This guide, however, will forever be a period piece of Cambodia's tragic years."
4,A must for all travelers,Used this book for my trip to Cambodia - as with all Lonely Planet books very informative and a must for travelers.
5,Great resource,"This had all that you would want or need out of a guidebook--helpful maps, ideas and descriptions, etc. A bit outdated, but that is to be expected with a country that is changing as quickly as Cambodia."
2,5th edition not updated as it should be,"So I thought that investing in the most recent edition of this book would behoove me, but upon looking up one of the ""author's picks,"" for lodging, I discover that he and Lonely Planet have not updated the book for the hotel's *price.* This is really important to me, as I work in non-profit and can't afford expensive digs when travelling.The author and Lonely Planet state that Renakse Hotel in Phnom Penh costs $25-50/night. I understand that hotel prices change over time, but prices I bought this book fresh off the press last month. Prices at Renakse are now a whopping $76-100/night and they have been since the end of 2004.The author's writing style is great, but you may want to pick up an older version of the book (4th edition seems just the same as this one when I read it before getting this one) and save the extra bucks."
3,"Very nice for Angkor Wat, Phnom Penh, lacking for the rest","I spent about a month total in Cambodia in 2002 going from Siem Riep to Phnom Penh and then Phnom Penh to Banlung and back again by motorcyle. My friends and I had an LP Guide and it was very helpful for Angkor Wat and lodging info in Phnom Penh but we found for everywhere else we went that Adventure Cambodia and Rough Guide were what we looked at. Getting off the beaten path seemed to be better covered in these books, especially Adventure and I would strongly recommend that book if you are planning on doing motorcycle touring on your trip!"
4,Bring this to Cambodia,This is the book I took to Cambodia. For me the important thing was that it had the phone numbers of the various guest houses and hotels. Only 4 stars because Anything other than Phnom Penh and Angkor was given skimpy coverage.
2,Get the Rough Guide,"In the group I was traveling with we had both the Rough Guide and the Lonely Planet guide and we consistently found the Rough Guide superior to the Lonely Planet in terms of narration, history, accuracy, ease of use, and better maps. We traveled extensively throughout the country including many outlying / ""off the beaten path"" areas where there was not a tourist to be found. Neither book was entirely comprehensive but the Rough Guide was a must have to point you in the right direction to find more info."
2,Lonely Planet has lost it.,"LP used to be the leader, especially in SE Asia. The frame of this book was written quite well and I'm sure a long time ago it would have been informative, but alas this book hasn't been properly updated in maybe a decade so pretty much everything is outdated and misleading. LP continues to rake in money selling books but they don't take the responsibility of keeping them up to date even though they continue to re-package them with glossy new cover photos as ""new editions"" but they contain almost no new data. Based on this principle I would not recommend to buy LP any longer and specifically the Cambodia guide. My experience traveling to Cambodia with the LP guide changed my opinion about Lonely Planet forever. Get a clue LP! Until they wake up you should use the internet as a travel guide and buy one or more other publishers guide books for your destination."
2,More Boogaloo than Salsa.,"As was the case with his ""Let's Turn On (Arrebatarnos)"" album, Bobby's ""Bad Breath"" has far many more Boogaloos than Salsa tracks. To my understanding, ""Batman's Bugalu"" is considered by many a classic of the Boogaloo genre and the title track was also a big hit but I nonetheless found this album very disappointing. Bobby Valentin's subsequent Fania releases ""Algo Nuevo"" (1970), ""Rompecabezas"" (1972), ""Soy Boricua"" (1973) and the absolute classics ""Rey Del Bajo"" and ""In Motion"" (both 1974) were all much better and more enjoyable Salsa albums."
3,Eh...new formula has pros and cons,"I have been a loyal fan of Frederic Fekkai hair products for many years and was excited to try the new formulation of the full-volume shampoo and conditioner. The shampoo is great, more lightweight with a refreshing scent. However...while the conditioner is also lightweight and smells good, it has lost its detangling properties. My hair is shoulder-length and fine and thus easily tangled and this new formula is a real struggle to work through my hair. It takes several minutes and the resulting clump of loose hairs is alarming. I have switched to the glossing conditioner which is still fabulous."
2,conditioner,did not like the smellit did not leave my hair soft and shinylike the for color treated hair product more
2,Didn't work well with my hair,"I have fine, straight, long, smooth hair, and when I used this product with the Fekkai Full Volume Shampoo, it left my hair feeling clumpy, sticky, and almost brittle. I used it once, and the entire day I felt like my hair was tangled, and when I'd run my hands through it, my hair felt sticky. (And yes, I rinsed well; I have fine hair and make it a point to rinse well every day.) I wouldn't recommend this product to someone with a similar hair type."
3,It's ok,"When I first started using the shampoo and conditioner, it gave me volume. But the more I used it, my hair felt coated - almost dirty. I gave it up. Maybe if you use it every other time you wash your hair it would be ok. I just don't need 20 different bottles of shampoos in the shower."
2,Not what I expected,"Bought this after first trying Fekkai Glossing Shampoo/Conditioner. What a difference. The glossing set left my hair feeling silky smooth! Smoother than ever before. I used another brand of mousse for body and I was sssssatisfied. Not with this product. It leaves my hair frizzy. No body, not manageable, just frizzy. I'm giving it away to a friend who recommended it."
4,Another great product in the Fekkai line.,About a year ago I received a free sample from Fekkai sponsored by Target. I tried the product and was amazed at the results. Target only carried the 4oz size and most times were out of stock. Buying this item through Amazon has both been economical and convenient.
2,My hair smells like men's aftershave,"I like that the product description's first sentence is ""who's it for?"" because I wasn't sure after using it. I have no idea why it has such a strong, musky smell (like Old Spice). For the amount of money it cost - I expected it to be flawless. It does make your hair feel weightless, but unless you love to smell like your man's aftershave or deodorant...I suggest you save your money and avoid this product."
5,Outstanding!,"I am very impressed with Alex's originality and musical talents. Whether you are a country or rock fan, this CD will leave you singing the songs and bring a smile to your face. THE FIREMANS PRAYER is a touching tribute to those who risk their lives everyday to keep us safe. One of the best CDs I have ever purchased."
4,Dark but decent,"True, this book is not a feel-good story about someone overcoming all odds to achieve some nearly impossible feat, however, it is a good read. It may be somewhat disturbing in that the characters are truly dysfunctional, but if light entertainment is what you want then go to the movies. I enjoyed it thoroughly and read it in a couple of sittings. If you're looking for a book about NJ, however, then don't read this one because it could really take place anywhere."
3,"good, but depressing","This book was good, but it did not make me feel good. The characters were real, almost too real...they have enough bad qualities, where are the good? The parents cheat on each other, the kids screw anyone they feel like. But such is life, right? Good book."
5,Modern Day Classic,"While this book maps out the geography and demographics of northern New Jersey in the 1980s, it is anything but regional fiction. The author's style, and the depth and range of his characters is virtuosic; moreover, this book has such momentum and such compelling characters that it's hard to put down. For a week I kept looking forward to getting back to these characters and their stories. The layers upon layers in this book and the philosophical questions that come up make it the kind of book I can imagine being read in college courses on contemporary literature. It's right there with Roth, Cheever, and Updike , as far as I'm concerned. I can't wait to read The Odd Sea."
5,excellent,"i bought the eagerly awaited 2nd book from Mr. Reiken and was not able to put it down. The characters are lovable and complex, siimilar to peolple in our everyday lives. I recommend it highly. Reiken did it again!"
4,Loves and Losses,"The loves and losses of Anthony Rubin are bewitching. You will enjoy this novel from the perspective of a vulnerable human being--thirsting after love, experiencing abandonment. I laughed, I cried, I thought. I enjoyed the different points of view, but I would have loved to hear the entire novel from Anthony's eye. This is a coming of age and a coming of ""understanding"" novel. It is wonderful. Check it out. You'll enjoy it. You'll want to re-read it. You'll want to take Anthony into your arms and your heart."
4,Kiss is back for Revenge!,After the dreadful Hot in The Shade Kiss is back for Revenge. Excellent cd Gene is totally demonized on the record and it proves in one of his best ever Unholy. This is a must for Kiss fans. Their heaviest since Animalize. COS is even better. A must get!
4,Great album.,"I've often joked with people that this was the album they actually got musicians to perform on. It is a solid album with great playing. I found the early albums to have a pretty basic non-technical approach to the music. It was all about the hook in the chorus. But this album really has some substance and attitude. I would have been offended had it been called Revenge and it came out sounding like Crazy Nights or something. I think it was their finnest hour. Definitely worth a listen, even if only for ""Domino"" & ""Unholy."""
5,Kiss gets back to their roots,"After all the 80s' experimentation with pop, disco and 'concept albums', someone finally figured out that it was time for Kiss to get back to their hard rock roots, and the result was this outstanding album. the best songs are ""Unholy"", ""Domino"", ""God Gave Rock N Roll To You II"", and ""Take It Off"". This is a great album get it if you dont got it."
4,Return to Roots,"REVENGE is the best KISS album since the makeup days of the 70's. Some good guitar work and some hard edged songs, what else do you want? Even non-KISS fans can get into this."
5,"Good Rock, Mediocre KISS","Whilst it is an album that works Great as Rock, its not KISS, except for Tracks 4,5,6, and the rip off of Ace's work in track 12.Tracks 4-6 are killer KISS, but not the rest of the album.5 Stars for the three tracks.Bruce may be a fabulous guitarist, and I saw him give an up close and personal demo of the solo at a convention that played some KISS videos. His totally live version of the solo from UNHOLY was pitch perfect, and it was hilarious when a young kid copied the album solo for unholy in EXACTLY the same manner. Bruce is a nice guy... I saw that at the convention in Melbourne, Australia, but he is no KISS guitarist... IMO.Still Eric Singer is the most outrageously great Drummer this side of Carmine Appice."
2,This album is a farce...,"Revenge for what? They pretend to be all heavy and sinister again, but this album stinks...- cRAIG"
5,REVENGE IS SWEET!!,"Kiss hits home with Revenge. After dealing with the untimely death of Eric Carr, Kiss gets back to what they do best. Rock & Roll.Gene's demonic voice is back starting off the album with UNHOLY. Usually it's a Paul Stanley song that starts off a Kiss album. Up second in TAKE IT OFF, Paul Stanley at his best. I feel this album is a real good rocker. Turn this one up as well, for it will get you going. Stand out tracks are TAKE IT OFF, HEART OF CHROME and GOD GAVE ROCK & ROLL TO YOU 2.You will not be dissapointed with this album!!"
3,Kiss back in black but not a classic,"Following the sad and early passing of Eric Carr in 1991, Kiss began recording Revenge with their new drummer Eric Singer in September 1991. Released in May 1992, it was clearly an improvement over Kiss' three previous albums. Revenge also marks the first time in Kisstory Gene kickstarts a Kiss album and sure he does it well with Unholy. Bruce Kulick also shows a lot of growth in his playing and contributes quite a lot to the overall sound of the album. Some songs are just a bit over-produced by Bob Ezrin and both Take It Off and I Just Wanna have pointless slow parts in the middle which get annoyingly in the way. But apart from some flaws, one can find plenty of good stuff here - Unholy, Tough Love, Domino, Heart Of Chrome and Paralysed sound great and should satisfy any Kiss fan."
3,"Some Good Songs But Doesn't Live Up To The Fan Hype, Not A Great, Coheasive Album.","Like with Hot In The Shade there are a couple of real standout tracks and a number of real crappers. But the live show was amazing it's too bad it wasn't more successful. The production of the album was much better and a big improvement over a number of their 80s(and 70s for that matter) releases but I don't feel the songs hold up. Highlights include Unholy, Domino, God Gave Rock N Roll To You, Paralyzed, Carr Jam and I'll even throw the band a bone and say I Just Wanna and Take It Off. Low points and down right crap are Spit, Though Shalt Not, Tough Love and a couple others. Gene and Paul dropped the ball on the goal line this time and had to settle for the 3 point conversion. It doesn't live up to the ""Big Comeback"" hype it has gotten over the years. Good production and some great performances but alot of the songs really flounder. Reminds me of Hot In The Shade and Sonic Boom."
2,Better than Crazy Nights/Hot In The Shade,"I feel embarrassed for Kiss. This is supposed to be a comeback album? It's really just boring. Much better albums exist out there. Hell, Kiss made a lot better albums. Anything pre-solo is great. Anything post The Elder through Animalize is damn good. Anything after Animalize is just is plain awful except for Revenge. It's not terrible like Crazy Nights or Hot In The Shade but there really aren't any redeeming qualities about it either. If you liked this album that's great and you are welcome to. But do yourself a favor if you have not already. Find something else to listen to. There are a million albums better than this snoozefest."
4,Interesting Mix,"I liked it... it's a good mix of slower, dirtier and louder songs. You could find anything to match your mood on this CD."
2,KISS Gave Rock 'N' Roll to YOU!!!!,"Yes, it's true I only give Revenge 2 stars. In all honesty it's my least favorite KISS album. I do like a few songs though.""Unholy"" ""God Gave Rock 'N' Roll to You"" ""I Just Wanna"" ""Heart of Chrome"" and of course ""Carr Jam 1981"" These are the only tracks I really listen to when playing Revenge. The album is dedicated to the late great Eric Carr which is very cool.I recommend all the other KISS releases first, but to make your collection complete you must own Revenge."
1,Don't be fooled,"I'm a huge Kiss fan, but for all their posturing Gene and Paul ust weren't convincing on this one. The album is contrite and obvious. They seemed content to become [copy] artists, stealing from everyone including Zeppelin and Metallica. The CD completely lacks the soul of earlier Kiss albums. It was hailed as the ""return"" of Kiss, but make no mistake. It [stinks]. You'll listen to it twice and then never again. It makes a great coaster, though."
1,Trash,This album doesn't even rate a review.What is it about Paul Stanley? During the makeup-less years he just sounds so annoying!As for Gene Simmons...he stopped penning good songs years ago!
2,"a major, major disappointment.....Montezuma's Revenge","I was so looking forward to this knowing Ezrin would produce it and it would be a tribute to Carr. But, after hearing it I upchucked. This is terrible with cringe inducing lyrics and uninspired writing. Revenge of the Washed-Up Jungle tight losers. ""Take It Off"" my CD player -it's ""Unholy"" -and since it gave me Montezuma's Revenge I'm gonna ""Uhh All Night""."
4,With Vengence,"Personally, I am a fan of the original line up of KISS. But the Revenge album must be one of the best Kiss albums ever released. With tracks such as ""Unholy"" and ""Domino"", not much can compare with this album. Both Bruce Kulick (L. Guitar) and Eric Singer (Drums, Backing Vocals) gave KISS a new edge on this album. I recommend this album without reserve. Any ""DIE-HARD"" KISS fan will likely appreciate this album. Enjoy."
3,operations management,"Covers the key ideas underlying the operations manager's role within the modern organisation. Based on recognition of the convergence of the manufacturing and service philosophies into a mix that is unique to each organization. Discusses the interaction between operations and other business functions including finance, marketing, human resources and, research and development."
5,Good for Men Too!,"My wife had this book and encouraged me to take a look. I did and was most plesantly suprised. Though the stories are all told by women, the message of each applies equally to men. What one of us couldn't identify with being confronted with a life or death situation and finding the internal strength to survive or being mistreated by a boss and finding the internal resources and imagination to overcome and prosper. These might be women's stories but they contain eternal truths and wisdom."
5,A great introduction to a brilliant diplomat,I initially purchased this book to learn more about Talleyrand who I had encountered mainly through his cutting quotes. I thought the book was very enjoyable and quite a lot of fun. I am not an expert on that period by any stretch but I was educated in the French Lycee system which made it fairly easy to relate to various characters and events in the book. As a casual reader interested in the complexities and depth of the character of Talleyrand I found the book to be very informative and enjoyable to read.
1,Mine literally exploded!,"All I can say is, good thing I wasn't in the line of fire, when my kettle exploded and the lid came hurling through my kitchen.Just don't buy this product, please!"
5,Steeler mousepad is sharp!,"The mousepad arrived in plenty of time for the holidays, and it is really of high quality. Sharp looking and detailed nicely. I'm happy I decided to get it!"
4,Nice mouse pad,"I really like this one. It not only has my favorite football team's logo, but it's also sturdy with a good weight to it. Nice product all around."
5,Hello Kitty,I found this book to be a helpful learning tool for my child who is homeschooling and traveling around the country this year. It is a gem with the flair of being chic for my 5 year old.
2,Atari Teenage Riot at their worst!,"I am a big Atari Teenage Riot fan, and this is by far their worst album. The whole album is boring except for a minute or so. It is not really music, but a noise show with no real talent. I would only recommend this album to die hard fans of Atari Teenage Riot and Nine Inch Nails. Also, this album is over-priced..."
1,"Waste of time, space and money","Ok, First off, I do consider myself an ATR fan. I'm 100% with their message, I love most of the work coming out of Digital Hardcore Recordings as a whole. But don't waste your money on this. They did a 26:47 ""noise show"" alright...that's it. You too can pay twenty bucks for a coaster containing one track of nothing but a half hour of static. This CD is a complete rip off."
3,they are disposanble bibs...,"I bought these for my 10 month old to use when we go out to eat, so I didn't have to pack up a semi messy bib back into my bag. They are pretty much what you'd expect from a disposable bib, kinda like the dentist bibs they put on you when you are going to get your teeth worked on. However, I put it on him and within 2 seconds he had pulled it off, I tried again and even tried distracting him and again he pulled it right off. I will say they came in a nice package so they fit into a diaper bag really well. My son just wasn't having it on him at all, he keeps all other bibs on so I don't really know what his deal was. He loves to ripped paper so maybe that was it, since they basically are paper. :( I will try again next time we go out, I really wanted these to work out for us."
5,A Gentleman Drunk,"Jeffrey Taylor's ""A Gentleman Drunk"" was so incredibly fascinating and fast-paced I read it in one evening. So many of our stories are in this wonderful sharing of a heart and soul that was in such racking pain. I plan to re-read this on a less excited basis, again and again. Thank you, Jeffrey, for your sincerity and demonstrating how we sufferers can survive this mixed curse and blessing."
2,Overall? Trite and derivative,"With a few exceptions, I am disappointed in this collection of shorts. Great concept but what a bunch of lousy submissions apart from Jeffery Deaver's 'Born Bad'. The book is worth it just for this story.Did these, for the most part well known and highly regarded writers, do a quickie favor for the editor? It would appear so. The average reader will be able to guess at the ending about a paragraph into the story. Second, the ""dangerous women"" seem to be stuck on sadism against men originating in lack of or too much of - you got it, sex. And finally, apart from one or two selections, the shorts derive their plot line from mainly noirish elements...cops, tough guys...bleak urban landscapes, and yes...dangerous femmes fatales...give me a break.You want dangerous women? See Barbara Stanwyck in Double Indemnity or read the novel by James Cain."
5,Plante Bandera,"Top quality music, oldie but goodie. Amazon has one of the biggest latin music collection on the web to choose from, if your looking for music from yesteryear look no further that Amazon is the place to shop!!"
5,Finally the whole story,"This book touched me. Not only does it give you insite in to what really happened that terrible night so long ago, but insight into who Marilyn Monroe really was and some of the reasons behind some of the things she did. The inter-linking of people that entered her life, the Kennedy's, her childhood, marriages, and the details of that terrible night of her death (murder to be sure) are all there. There have been so many books on Marilyn Monroe and speculation of how she died. I read it and kept shaking my head that so many people ""got away with"" so much! The lies, the cover ups, the ""lost"" evidence. It's all there. You can't help but feel sorry for a woman that just wanted to be loved, and discusted at the way the investigation (what a joke) was handled. People went to their graves with secrets, but the secrets are out now. If you are a Marilyn fan or into conspiracy theories, this is a great book!"
3,Marilyn Monroe,It appears no matter how much you read about Marilyn it is like the Kennedy assaniation...we will never know for sure what happened.
1,No star,The item I ordered was to be mailed by November 16 and received by me by the 28th of December. (I assumed that meant THIS year). To date have received nothing.
5,A very enjoyable read,"I am lucky enough to have this book in my personal library and have read it twice. It was a fun, engaging read both times. The characters have depth and complexity. Even the ""bad guys"" have good points and tragic life histories which makes the need to ""suspend disbelief"" much easier. The plot, located in the USA and Europe, has interesting twists and turns which kept my attention throughout the book."
3,"First of the ""Stone Angel"" books..","""The Dark Goddess"" is a good work with complex characters, and a nice plot about Soviet espanionage. The wife of a top Presidental adviser has been presumed dead, but unbeknowst to all except two men that loved her, she is being held prisoner by forces alligned with the Soviet Union. It is up to Pete Sawyer, a dual citizen(French and American) who was the woman's former lover, to track her down before the enemy's plot is discovered. He uses his skills as a corporate investigator to find her in a valley in France. Then, the climax occurs with villians that are not totally unsympathetic. Great action, and a good taut thriller. Looking forward to the other books in the series"
4,Tim Wilson,Tim is funny and this is a good example of his talent. If you had a son just getting out of jail...it could be Tim....<G>
4,motowncollector,"This is a great collection of super obscure Motown with not one hit in the bunch. Where else can you find such Motown artists as Sherri Taylor, LaBrenda Ben, The Satintones, and Bottom and Co. Most of these cuts are excellent with special mention of LaBrenda Ben's The Chaperone, and The Isley Brothers' Seek and You Shall Find, later the title of a Marvin Gaye rarities collection."
4,Quite Adequate,"This ring is quite adequate for the price. The side baguettes aren't EXACTLY identical in height, so that was a bit disappointing (but not enough so as to warrant returning the ring). I will keep this piece of jewelry, although I haven't decided whether or not I will use this particular dealer again in the future."
1,Could not finish,"I can typically read enough of a book to get into it, but not this one. I felt like I was reading a disaster written by a child. Not sure if it is the style of writing, but I couldn't do it. I even put it down, then tried to read it again, no luck, still awful."
3,Not quite what is was expecting,"This wasn't quite what I was expecting. The title and description made me think that wolves or werewolves were going to involved with a bit of action but it didn't have any of that. A couple of times I almost gave up on because I almost got bored with. For me the ending almost felt anti-climactic. I don't think mysteries are for me. If your into mysteries, its a decent read."
4,Grabbed me from the beginning...,"The Hounding grabbed me from the beginning; I thoroughly enjoyed the play on Sherlock Holmes and the clever descriptions found throughout the book. For instance, ""Here the air was perfumed with lemon oil applied weekly, hundreds of times over."" How cleverly does that denote age? I also appreciated the list introducing the characters and wish more novels included one. From the perspective of a logger's daughter, however, the author seems to have some erroneous assumptions about logging. Overall, the book is a good read."
3,"A Witty, Female Perspective on The Hound of the Baskervilles","Complete Review on at: [...]A comfortable lil' cozy, I felt that The Hounding was a really well written Indie book. Keep in mind that it is a cozy mystery, but it doesn't beat the reader over the head with the traditional definition of the ""silly"" cozy mystery! The book offered an excellent storyline, awesome twists and turns and wonderfully developed characters. Being a fan of Sherlock Holmes, I love to read ""plays"" on his character and Ms. de Helen did a wonderful job!What made me smile most about this book is the underlying play and obvious research that Ms. de Helen did in comparing The Hounding to Doyle's ""The Hound of the Baskervilles"". For example, the murder victim, Priscilla Vandeleur, is a direct descendant of Sir Charles Baskerville. She has the same phobias regarding dogs as in ""The Hound of the Baskervilles"". It was a hoot to read!"
2,I DIDN'T LIKE THE BOOK,"The book rubbed me the wrong way. I did not like the characters or the plot of the story. Others may like it, but I did not."
5,Great music,Absolutely love her voice..very unique. Give Me a Kiss is by far one of the best songs I have heard this year. Her music is great. In the Dirt is a great song. You'll enjoy this whole CD.
2,smaller than expected,I ordered these items for friends that are new grandparents. But I didn't realized that the books are about the size of a index card. It really does not leave much room for telling their stories. I like the concept but it would be great if is was bigger. It compares to a package of 100 or more index cards on a spiral binder.
3,Gift for Grandpa,"Nice book and would have rated it a lot higher if the book had been bigger - I guess I missed how small the book actually was. I did give it to a friend who is about to become a grandpa, but he'll definately have to use reading glasses to use."
3,Picture is misleading!!!,This is a nice little Q&A book with lots of questions for mom to answer. The picture is misleading...it is spiral bound book the size a little bigger than 3x5 cards. Nice idea...not well planned.
3,Okay,I thought the idea of this book was great but some of the questions were a little feminin for a grandfather to a grandson. Had my father-in-law had more than a few weeks to complete this it may have been a better option.
3,again to small,this is a great idea but to small. my grandparents have hard time reading small print and writing small wish they were bigger
1,low quality,The book is very low quality and pages are so thin they were already starting to tear out of spiral book just from shipping and they are so thin they are see-thru and it would be impossible to write on them.
5,Genealogist's Delight,"Anyone working on their family history will delight in this book. It presents questions to be answered by Grandpa for every day of the year. When the questions are all answered, the family historian will have a wealth of information for research and hundreds of anecdotes for the family tree. At the next family reunion encourage everyone to buy and complete the appropriate book in the series for themselves and let the historian add it to the tree.."
3,Too Small,"While I like everything about this book, it was entirely too small. It is also not very sturdy. Had I known that, I would have purchased something else."
2,The book is too smal to write in,The book looks much larger online. It is actually the size of a notebook card. Good content but trying to write in the book is hard for grandparents.
4,review,"Nice, but I should have read the description better. As others have mentioned, this book is small. Not much space to write in."
1,Very Disappointing!! Does not even deserve 1 star!,"The name Peterson should NOT even be on this guide!! I have many older Peterson guides and have always found referenced any critter of any type I needed to look up. BUT this one was a waste of my money - if I had not damaged the spine opening it when I first received it to look up info I would have returned it. NONE of the 3 snakes that I have seen in areas near Atlanta several times were referrenced! So for me, it was a total waste of money. I found much more info for free on the University of Georgia website. But I like having field guides for when we are outdoors without a computer. This is NOT the one to buy, however. Also, I do not like how it is organized, either - info on a species of snake might require you to look in several different places for info/photo. :("
5,Excellent for identification of reptiles and amphibians,"I live in North Carolina and I have been able to identify all the snakes, lizards, turtles, and frogs that I have found using this book. Good descriptions and photos to help you tell the difference between different species."
1,reptiles & amphibians,I was looking for a more discriptive book on snakes wanted a good picture of each speices That was not the case with this book
2,Peterson Field Guide Reptiles and Amphibians,"I just bought this book elsewhere and am very disappointed that it does not specify whether anything is poisonous and non-posisonous. This is very important so as not to harm animals that will do us no harm if left alone or so we know not to touch them in the case of some toads and lizards. It would be nice if when looking for these books, Amazon would let you see a couple of pages, so that you could tell this without having to buy it and then sending it back as needed info is missing."
5,interesting & eceltic,This is some of the most interesting music I have heard in a long time. Asian influenced heavy Indian rhythm.Arjun is a master of many instruments and his vocals stirring.
2,Do not buy the DGB-600BC - It does not complete brew cycle,"My wife and I are on our second DGB-600BC. The first one had all sorts of problems and lasted about 2 years. Cuisinart was nice enough to ship us a new unit last year (2007) for no cost. We appreciated that, but now the replacement unit will not complete the brewing cycle. We had this same problem with our last unit. Our patience has been exhaused; we are giving up on Cuisinart grind and brew coffee makers. If anyone has found a grind and brew coffee maker that actually works, please let me know."
5,"Love it, love it, love it!","My wife and I bought this unit after visiting her sister who has one. We love it! The only drawback I can think of, is it doesn't pour as easily as a normal coffee pot. You have to tip it forward so far that you may think the pot is empty. I attribute this to the design which allows for the coffee to brew directly into the insulated pot. We love the fact that we can brew either grounds or whole beans, and program it for either the night before. If you're using grounds you just push the ""Grind Off"" button when programming. The carafe keeps the coffee hot for hours, especially if you're able to warm it with hot water just before brewing. Best coffee maker we've ever owned."
2,Not worth it,"This machine makes really good coffee and you get used to cleaning it every time you use it, but they simply don't last very long. I'm on my second (and last) one. The first one lived about 2 years, this one has lasted about six months. Very pricey, time consuming to clean, don't have a long life, basket tends to pop out and make a mess, but makes wonderful coffee when it works. I'd give it five stars if it was all about the coffee, but the problems outweigh the good."
1,"Too complex, not hot enough, hard to clean",I bought this as a Christmas gift for my mother and returned it within a few days. The coffee brews at a temperature that is too low for good flavor and the burner does not keep the pot hot enough for later drinking. The workings of the unit are too complex and it is difficult to clean. I would not recommend this product.
1,The WORST coffee maker!,"Well, it sounds like a good idea to have coffee grinder and coffee maker all in one, but Cuisinart did NOT get it right. The grinding function is completely high maintenance. You have to wash out all the grinding parts after ever use and you end up wasting coffee because that compartment gets wet while brewing causing the newly ground coffee to stick to it. Also, plan on waking up the whole family when you're making your morning coffee, because the grinder is SO loud. And if that's not bad enough, the compartment that holds the freshly ground coffee often pops open while the coffee is brewing spewing coffee & grinds all over the place. Seriously, don't waste your money."
3,dissappointing coffeemaker,"I bought this product thinking it would make my life simpler, I was wrong.The grinder doesn't do a good job of grinding the coffee and sometimes whole beans are left in it. Don't forget to put the top back on the filter cup either or you will have coffe everywhere. It was hard for me to get used to putting a cap on the filter cup. The grinder and it's top must be cleaned and dried each time you use it or it will clog and stick and waste coffee. The pot is not insulated and doesn't keep coffee warm, and the base does not heat as well. It's an ok but not great product, especially for the money"
1,Don't bother with this one!,"This is the worst design for a grind and brew coffee machine. Not only do the coffee grinds get all over the inside and outside of the machine, making it a total mess, but so does the water. So you end up with a wet mess of coffee grinds every time you brew a cup of coffee. The mess builds up in the grinder and prevents it from spinning. So you get a good cup of coffee at the expense of spending 15 minuntes of cleaning and maintenence every time you use this machine. Not worth the $150 or less that it sells for!**Check out the Melita grind and brew that sells for under $100. Its got a much better design and makes great coffee. It got great reviews."
2,Great Caraffe - that's about it,I wanted to get a grind in brew coffee pot with a caraffe so options under $300.00 were limited. I found this and really liked the look. Overall it's easy to figure out (if your not one for directions) BUT it really has some faults that need to be corrected. The filter door pops open randomly. The first two times (after a brief freak out) I tried to take a look at how I was doing things to see if maybe how I put the filter in or the plastic top was actually causing the door to pop but I couldn't see how I could be more careful. I actually had one run of about6 pots of coffee with no issues but the messes just keep happening and my frustration level reached it's limit. I boxed the thing back up and returned it. The positive is the caraffe. It keeps the coffee hot even overnight. I hope Cuisinart can figure out how to improve the filter door - they'd have a pretty great product if they did.
1,Don't buy this coffee maker!,"Not only is it extremely messy, but if you like strong coffee you won't like this machine. Using the grind option makes very weak coffee so you have to fill the basket with more coffee so there's no point. Without the grind option it's just another coffee maker. We had ours for 3 months, threw it out and bought a Mr. Coffee for 20 bucks. It's not worth the expense and certainly not for the coffee connoiseur. =^^="
1,"If you don't want to drink coffee, buy this coffee machine","Okay, so first of all, the pot is poorly designed. Everytime you pour water out of it (or coffee) you are GUARANTEED to spill a little on the countertops. Next, the steam does not escape this machine at all, so you have to open the thing up after every pot to dry it out.My wife and I have had the coffee machine for a little over 2 years. After about 6 months, we had to start figuring out a way to trick the machine into grinding and brewing -- it involved turning the ""on"" switch a little to the left, then quickly to the right. That worked for a while. Then, 2 days ago, it stopped working. Entirely. No tricks, no nothing.The design is beautiful. But the greatness of this machine ends on the outside. Inside it's just a terribly sad excuse for a grind and brewer."
1,DON'T BUY THIS PIECE OF CRAP !,"I have this poor excuse for a coffeemaker. Overpriced and it doesn't do the job. I have it 3 years. For $150.00 it should last longer than that! It leaks from the bottom and mine isn't the only one doing that. The coffee doesn't stay warm for more than 10 minutes. If they were giving them away FREE - I wouldn't take one. My warantee was up but I called Cuisinart anyway. They offered to have me ship it to them, they'd evaluate it, and then tell me how much to fix it. Big deal. Taking it to the dumps where it belongs. Don't buy this. You'll spend $150 for garbage."
1,Unsuitable at any price,"Oh, where do I start? Well, lets start with the grinder. The grinding unit is plastic with a coarse finish, that the grinds cling to, causing probably 1/3 of them to remain in the grinder. This requires you to disassemble the grinder and clean it thoroughly for every pot. This issue also causes the coffee to be very weak. The grinder makes an ungodly amount of noise (it literally scares small children). Grinds will get caught in the latch for the basket causing it to spring open while brewing. This, in turn, causes the brew-pause valve to close, even though water continues to reach the basket, overflowing it all over the floor. Try grinding your own beans? Don't grind them too fine, and make sure you don't put in enough for a decent pot of coffee as it will overflow the basket.On the plus side?1. Digital clock keeps decent time2. The Carafe is actually very nice3. The cheap plastic makes a delicious crunch as you smash it to pieces."
1,A real piece of overpriced garbage,"First: No matter what kind of bean you use, it always brews weak, insipid coffee.Second: The parts are a pain to deal with, and get messy very quickly.Third: The grinder doesn't grind well at all, gets clogged with damp 'goo'.Fourth: It clogs and has 'backed up' on many occasions, resulting in a mess.It's a complete waste of money-badly designed and cheaply made.A couple of 'pros'. It looks good on the countertop. The thermal carafe is nice looking.Seriously: If you want decent coffee, go buy a press or a twenty-dollar cheapie, just don't buy this thing if you are a serious coffee drinker."
1,Bad Choice,"This is one of the worst coffee makers I have owned. Maintaining this beast is a pain. You must clean it AND dry it througly every night or else your coffee will taste awful. Also, it doesn't have a warmer and if you are like me and drink your coffee over the course of several hours, this will not work for you. Don't buy this one... move on!"
4,"Easy to use, easy to clean, great cup of coffee","I bought this a few months ago and have been very happy with it with no problems at all. You do have to clean it after every use, however it is very simple to clean and takes about 10 seconds..Just rinse the parts and wipe dry with a paper towel.My girlfriend like an incredibly hot cup of coffee. Unless you warm the carafe before brewing, it will not be hot enough for the lover of piping hot coffee; especially if you're just making a couple of cups at a time. Hot coffee pouring into a cold thermal carafe means a cooler coffee. 30 seconds in the microwave before she drinks it is perfect and the flavor is tremendous.This machine makes tremendous Iced Coffee. I bought a couple of pounds of the Dunkin Donuts coffee and I'll brew 8 cups and then immediately put it in a plastic milk carton and into the fridge. It actually tasted better than it does at Dunkin Donuts."
2,A machine with split personality,"This machine makes a great cup of coffee when it's behaving. The carafe keeps the coffee hot and never burnt tasting.I must say we rarely use the grinder. A pain to clean all the parts even when you don't use the grinder. But the most irritating characteristic of this machine is that you never, ever know when it's going to overflow all over itself and the counter - ruining the entire pot of coffee. Just as another reviewer stated...it will do it 2-3 mornings in a week and then go another 2-3 weeks before doing it again. And yes, we use the same grind each time, same brand of coffee, same amount of water and always place the filter basket as the instruction booklet warns. We've cleaned up our last mess today. We're getting another machine."
2,"Good coffee, but after 2 years it's on the fritz.","We have had this appliance for a little over two years, and it appears to be on the way out. It starts grinding on it's own, and conversely sometimes does not grind when we tell it to. It appears the circuitry now has problems.While we are very happy with the taste of the coffee, it is difficult to clean and we are going to try something else next to see if there is a better product for the money."
5,Worth it!!,"my brother has had this coffee pot for about 3 years and they really enjoy theirs. so on deciding whether or not to buy one, i have read so many of the reviews on this. i decided to buy it and i agree it is too tall to fit under a standard cabinet and does pour out very slowly. but as for the cleaning, it's not anymore than cleaning out a grinder and coffee pot individually each day - and i think it's worth it!! i really am enjoying this coffee pot and i just don't mind the extra cleaning because the flavor is absolutely worth it!!!"
1,Run Away! Run Away! (Unless you like cleaning),"Makes ok coffee, but it is such a pain to clean! Everyday you have to clean the grinder because it gets wet during brewing, the basket and of course, the carafe. But wait, there's more! You also have to clean the grinder compartment and underneath it too, because the ground coffee dust gets everywhere.Someone needs to design a coffee maker that does not expose the grinder to moisture. Watch this coffee maker drop in price, it is a lemon. Trust me, buy a Zojirushi, it's the best out there."
2,So many problems...,"This is the second of this type of coffee maker that I have had and I am always having problems. My mom bought the first one and the coffee would not brew correctly into the pot and it would spill all over along with the coffee grinds. The second has an entirely different problem...it doesn't brew all 12 cups at once! I do everything I need to do to make a full pot of coffee and it will brew three and then beep that it's done and I have to start it again (without the grinder) and it brews another couple of cups and beeps and then I have to do it a couple more times before it fills up! I've tried cleaning it and anything I can think of and it doesn't improve. So, since it takes about a half an hour to brew one pot of coffee, I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. I know a lot of people who love this coffee maker but I only saw problems."
1,Doesnt stay hot or on.,"Im a coffee pro! And let me tell you thiscoffee maker really is not good. The platedoesnt stay on after the coffee is made, andit gets actaully cool after less than 30 minutes.It doesnt even make a good tasting coffee.What a waste of money. The good news is Cuisinartmakes other coffee makers that are wonderful."
1,"If you like strong coffe, pick a different coffee maker!","I had high hopes that this coffee maker would solve my coffee grind mess problem, AND give me good coffee. Though it solved the mess, the coffee was terrible. I tried many ideas to make it stronger, but the basic problem was that the grind was too course, and the basket filter just doesn't do as good a job as the cone. I have now purchased the Melitta and am VERY happy with the coffee, for less money, and less parts to clean. When it comes right down to it, good coffee is what I'm after, and if a maker can't offer that, it's not worth anything."
1,HAD TO RETURN IT,"NO MATTER WHAT I TRIED, COULDN'T GET GOOD STRONG COFFEE.THE OLDER MODEL HAD A STRENGTH ADJUSTER AND THIS ONE NEEDS IT.EVEN CUSTOMER SERVICE WAS NO HELP. LIKED EVERY FEATURE BUT THE COFFEE IT MADE. MAY TRY ANOTHER BRAND. USING MY OLD FAITHFUL AND GRINDING COFFEE SEPARATELY FOR NOW.PAIGE"
3,Impossible to Clean,"The coffee is wonderful, but keeping this coffee ""system"" clean is next to impossible."
1,2 & Too Disappointed Coffee Drinkers,"My husband received this coffee maker as a retirment gift a week ago. He is a heavy coffee drinker and this was a great gift idea for him - except he (we) haven't had a good cup of coffee yet!! After reading all the other reviews, I see this is common. We have tried different coffees, different grinds, less water, you name it, but to no avail. I said we should use our old Krups (made great coffee) and just bring this out when the gift giver comes over. Otherwise, I don't think we'll ever have another cup of good coffee in our house. We are very disappointed."
1,Terrible coffeemaker - skip this one!,"This coffeemaker is awful but you won't know it until you read the manual inside. It clearly states that you must clean and dry the coffeemaker ""after every use"". Who wants that? You can't even get to where the coffee and steam build up the gunk. Even the first coldwater brew after the decalcification process spilled out onto my floor and all over the counter. The Macy's people wouldn't take it back, the Cuisinart people said they can only offer me 20% off a new same item (super idea! same crappy product!) from them and now I'm stuck with this DEFECTIVE coffeemaker. I haven't done anything to it except make coffee as a normal person would, I even went above and beyond to de-calcify it as they say and yet, NOTHING WORKS! DO NOT buy this item! It's more work than it's worth. I'm off to buy your standard programmable coffeemaker because that makes much more sense for $50 versus the over $200 paid for this piece of junk."
1,All style no substance--keep the box/paperwork!,"I was so excited when I got this coffee maker this past Christmas. I thought it was a much nicer version than the standard coffee maker I used before....that is until I used it for a couple weeks. Things I can't stand about this model: 1) You can't store beans in it, so you have to load the necessary beans everytime you brew. 2) This is by far the LOUDEST coffee grinder I have ever heard (think airline engine loud!). 3) The unit itself leaks from somewhere (still haven't figured out where, but we keep finding water nearby). 4) The coffee pot/carafe itself is poorly designed, as it is extremely slow to pour coffee and a bit awkward. Unfortunately for us, we tossed the box and paperwork, so we're stuck with it. Don't make the same mistake. On the plus side, we did keep our old coffee maker, so I guess we'll just go back to that one."
2,Look elsewhere,"I have two major complaints about this product. Firstly, the grinder is ""preset to a medium grind"". Well, I found it to be much coarser than the way I do it in my grinder so I have to use almost twice as many beans to get the same strength brew. At $11.99 per pound, that is not a good thing so I now disable the grind function and do it myself just like before. Secondly, the coffee doesn't get hot enough, even when using the heat-boosting ""1-4 Cup"" button. I have $150 coffeemaker and yet I grind my own beans and then have to microwave my coffee before drinking it. Thumbs down."
3,Tired of all the cleaning......,"We really enjoyed this at first. But after 1 year I've had it! It has backed up and spilled all over the floors and counters for the last time. Yes like others have stated before me, it's fine if you dont mind cleaning, drying, and replacing the multiple components after each use, because steam from brewing goes up and fills the chamber that grinds the coffee leaving behind a wet mess. But it's just too much work @ 6am. :("
1,Weak Coffee,"We got this as a gift and were excited, but ultimately disappointed.I would rather have the old $15 Mr.Coffee back. No matter how many different tricks we try (pulling the carafe out so it steeps a little, adding extra grounds) the coffee is weak and just BAD!I am going to go out and get another french press."
2,Huge disappointment; bad concept and stopped working after 9 months.,"First off, the grinding part is worthless since moisture accumulates inside the grinder and you have to clean out the grinder after practially every use. If you already have a grinder and think this would be a nice convenience, ask yourself how often you have to wash out your grinder. With this Grind and Brew you'll have to wash the carafe, grinder, filter, everything every time you use it.After only a few months the machine started having major issues. Coffee would overflow and spew hot coffee and coffee grinds all over the place. Somthing must be clogged, but having cleaned the machine several times, we're ready to give up.Two big thumbs down."
1,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS COFFEEMAKER,"I've read the other reviews, and I beg to differ. Rinsing will not clean the accumulated coffee from the bean reservoir or the chute. You must clean with either a sponge, paper towel, or your finger to scrape the residue. And, if you use an oily coffee like Starbucks, the buildup is just awful. It takes literally 5-7 minutes to clean the parts (properly) on this coffeemaker. The machine does produce good coffee. The upside is I'm drinking less coffee now because you don't dare have a second pot in the morning, unless you're on vacation and not in a hurry. The Capresso Coffee Team is a much better unit at only $50 more."
2,Too much trouble!,"Yes, I too thought that this would be a great coffee maker. As others have stated, this machine is nothing but work. The machine is hard to clean, with steam entering the grinder on every brew makes for a true mess. Additionally, if you would like a ""hot"" cup of coffee, you must pre-heat the thermal carafe with hot water before using, which makes using the programable option difficult. I really wanted to like this machine based on how nice it looks in my kitchen, however, I am returning it tomorrow."
3,it's fine,"While it is a little messy to clean and getting right amount of water is a bit difficult, it is nice to have your whole beans ground in the morning (programmed from the night before) and get a truly delicious cup of coffee.One warning though. For some reason, the door latch to the filter basket broke on my first model, which I sent back. After an eternity I got a new one, but the latch is still not perfect. A shame, because they could have not made it spring action and it would be fine."
2,Style over Substance,"I bought this coffeemaker because of the name and the way it looks, but after having had to live with it for a few months I am ready to toss it. The built-in grinder howls like a banshee waking up the entire house and you have to painstakingly clean it every morning or it will clog. The coffee is just OK. The one thing I really do like about the machine is the thermos carafe, it keeps the coffee hot for hours and doesn't burn it."
1,Unbelievably weak coffee,"This makes the absolute worst coffee I have ever had. Even filling the grinder to the maximum and putting in only a half carafe of water, the coffee comes out a pale brown with only a vague bitter flavor. No flavor of coffee at all. This is with the same French Roast beans we always use.I am absolutely stunned at how bad it is. We are definitely going back to our old coffee machine and giving this away."
3,Grinder/Brewer w/thermal carafe has faults.,"We like our coffee HOT. What I didn't know on ordering is that the carafe is not heated after brewing. There is no hot plate as the previous model had (we wore that one out!) We are slow morning movers and coffee sippers so by the time we've about drained the carafe it hasn't retained the heat we'd like. Also, we use the carafe to fill the brewing station and because it's steel, we can't fine tune the water level. Sounds picky but our filtered water isn't near the brewer. Our drinking water here is ghastly...But having the system grind just before brewing does make a really nicely flavored cup of coffee!And it looks cool, though!"
3,iff-y design,purchased this item for my mom in law for christmas and was so excited bec/ it looks so nice. She has never been able to get the grounds basket out to clean properly bec/ it's stuck! usually it would lift right out but apparently this is a flawed design as i've read other reviews with the identical complaint...i personally have an older cuisinart grind and brew and have never had a problem with this in 6 years of ownership so i didn't expect an issue with a newer model...
3,"WHY, WHY, WHY??",do they make it impossible to find a new water filter for this coffee maker???Even their OWN web site does not have one listed! I have asked two chain store managers that sell Cuisinart products to see it THEY could but one from the factory... NEITHER could!!Soo... We are going to get rid of this coffee maker next week for a $2. dollar item!! (and not buying a new one from Cuisinart)Quite Bizarre!
2,leaks all over when pouring...be careful!,I bought this coffee maker for my husband for Christmas. It makes great coffee but the carafe leaks when pouring. I badly scalded my hand and will not let guest pour their own coffee in fear that they will also get hurt. They need to come up with a fix for this problem as I see alot of complaints from other consumers regarding the leaking. It does make excellent coffee.
1,Cuisinart DGB-6000BC Grind and Brew,"Bad, bad, bad. Company not helpful at all. Condensation in grinder causes beans to not filter through to basket. More than half the time coffee beans are overground since they stick in the grinder and turn to powder. They must be scraped out. It's a mess and a real disappointment. On the other hand, if you grind the beans separately and add them (a hassle that should not have to happen), the coffeemaker does have the ability to brew very good tasting coffee."
3,First Generation - Doesn't deliver!,"Yes it's a great idea - but they haven't work out the functional flaws yet.- It is high maintenance. 4 parts need to be taken out and cleaned and dried after each use.- The carafe drips on the counter, no matter how you pour or clean the carafe. (they should be ashamed!)- The water filter makes the coffee taste better - but you can't seem to get a strong pot of coffee out of it. I think the cone style filter makes a better pot of coffee.- Has a compact case and looks good.- The black one is best, it gets so dirty inside, I can't imagine what the white one looks like.At this price - I'd wait till they have worked out the kinks in the design before purchasing it. We've had it for 1 month - and wish we had purchased a non grind and brew with a cone filter."
1,The worst coffe pot in the world,"My Cuisinart coffee pot was purchased less than a year ago and we find that we already have to replace it. Some of the problems we have had include:-Leaking water-Vibration of coffee grinding causes brew door to fly open (no audible tone sounds a ""warning"" as it does for just about everything else), so instead of coming down to freshly ground and brewed coffee in the morning you come down to hot water all over the counter and no coffee-Slide on brew door does not work often and there is quite a bit of trouble involved with opening the door to cleanAdditionally, for some reason there are 5 people in my immediate family that have these coffee pots and every single one of us experiences this problems. One sister went so far as to ship hers back to Cuisinart for repair but she still has all the same problems with it.My advice; Do not buy this coffee pot!"
1,An Expensive Mistake,"Sounds great. Grinds, brews, and keeps the coffee warm.The grinder sounds like an air-raid siren (at 5 am) and doesn't grind the coffee well enough to get a good cup of coffee (I spend too much on beans to drink Sanka). Okay, fine. I used my old grinder and put grounds in the basket. The basket pops open and gets grounds and coffee everywhere. This thing has ""blown-up"" so many times I just can't count any more. But, the thermal carafe works, (it's the only thing that does) it keeps the coffee hot.Finally though, I'm tired of this crap and I will return the coffee maker..."
5,I love it!,"I cannot say more about this coffee maker. I love that it is easy to use and brews an excellent cup of coffee. If you just rinse the five simple parts and throw them in the dry rack, you will have no problems. Most of the reviews here are from people who I can only assume are too lazy to clean up after themselves. Not only do I love mine, but I have bought others as presents and they are well loved too!If you really want a hot cup of coffee in the morning, simply follow the directions provided and soak the carafe in hot water for a few minutes. Otherwise, it still brews warm coffee."
1,Piece of Junk,I have the DGB-600BC model. I received it as a Christmas gift a year ago and have exchanged it 4 times. I loved it up until it quit working. It would only brew 1 to 2 cups at a time. Well we drink a lot of coffee in this house and I cannot devote and hour a day to making coffee and cleaning a machine. Every one of these we have owned has had the same problem. I am purchasing the Cuisinart coffee maker without the grind and brew feature. It works a lot better.
1,This product is complete junk!!!,"We finally decided to go out and spend a few extra bucks for a decent coffee maker and came across this one which had the grinder built in (which seemed like a good idea). At first glance the unit looks sharp (hence the 1 star) and we were looking forward to using our new toy. Here is what we found after our first week of use:1) Grinder sounds like a contractor in your kitchen sawing your kitchen table in half...yes..its that loud!2) Ok..so why do we buy coffee makers? For good coffee right? Well this brewed ""coffee flavored"" water. It was nasty and we even threw in an extra helping of beans than the recommended amount...WEAK!!!3) Now what? Yup..you have to break down the whole thing and clean it out...including the nasty slick sludge that accumulates in the grinding station. What a pain!!!Bottom line, we boxed it up and got a full refund for this joke of a coffee maker...DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT WASTING YOUR MONEY ON THIS!!!"
1,Defective out of the box!,"Got this for Christmas. Followed directions, poured water in and it all ran right out the bottom all over. I reread the manual sure that I had missed something - but no. Called customer service, they told me it was defective and to return to where I bought it."
2,Not a hot pot,"I read meany reviews before purchasing this particular machine and felt that any negative comment was subjective. I do agree the thermal pot Does Not keep coffee hot as advertised. I wanted the thermal pot to avoid the taste of ""cooked coffee"" if I lingered over a pot rather than consume immediately and was totally disappointed. By the time i went back for my second cup 20-30 mins later it had cooled to barely tepid.I tried several times- used hot water over cold, not good.Boiled water to heat carafe prior to brewing, so inconvenient.Finally I decided to just return it and continue shopping for a machine that gets better reviews.I will say my service through Amazon was excellent though. Both in quick delivery of product and in the return service."
2,"Awful Cleanup, Look Elsewhere","The mess! The mess! The clean-up is TERRIBLE and steals all the joy from your cups of coffee.Prepare for 10+ minutes of clean-up EVERY time you brew: 6 parts total, 2 of which (the grinder & grinder-lid) are plastered with WET OILY COFFEE DUST in every nook and cranny. This stuff STICKS, and requires dedicated sponge-work to get into all the corners where it lodges.This isn't ""optional"" cleaning either -- it's necessary for EVERY POT.Also, beware the grinder lid: There's a tiny rubber nub that can pop out during cleaning. If you lose it, no more grinding. It serves no discernible purpose. Idiotic designEventually, you will give up using the grind-and-brew features and revert to using a standalone grinder except when showing off toys for company.The Good: Makes tasty hot coffee directly from beans -- it does in-fact work.I'd say it takes approximates 5x as much cleanup/prep time as my old traditional coffee maker. I'd never buy this model again."
1,Carafe doesn't keep coffee hot,"According to the manual, the insulated thermal carafe is supposed to keep the coffee pipping hot for hours. NOT TRUE. The machine turns off, and the plate only supports the carafe, it doesn't heat it. The coffee is only hot enough for the first cup, and after that I have to tell my guests to place their coffee in the microwave. Disappointing. Well, if there's no heat source, how is it going to keep it hot? A metal carafe it's not like the old style glass lined thermal bottles (those worked!). If the objetive is to avoid burnt coffee, the manufacturer could perhaps have taken advantage of the programming function, and allow the user to select how long the plate should be on. After all, what's technology for?"
1,I think this coffee maker is possessed!,"We stopped using the grinder a long time ago since it really doesn't grind the coffee fine enough and often leaves very large chunks of coffee bean, and yes, it's really noisy.The big problem is that it unpredictably ""blows up"" - the door with the coffee basket flies open and hot water, coffee grounds and coffee go all over the counter and the floor. We're sure it's possessed by an evil spirit! If you want to make coffee, you're got to stand with it and babysit this machine every time unless you want a big mess!I'm surprised this machine is still on the market AND I'm surprised that Cuisinart designed such a bad coffee maker and hasn't fixed it!(It would be great if Cuisinart could take these back and replace them with coffee makers that really do work well) What's great about it? Insulated thermal carafe."
3,Lasts about a year then same problem...twice!!,"I have had two of these coffee makers and returned both of them for the same reason. After about 12 months of use, including diligant cleaning, the auto shut-off starts shutting off too early and the problem only gets worse. I am going to switch to a nice coffee grinder and a basic coffee machine.As for keeping coffee warm, the secret with any of the insulated carafes is to pre-heat the carafe with hot water before brewing the coffee. After 8 hours the coffee is still luke warm."
1,too much trouble,"After using this coffee maker for just one week, I give up.Making coffee a consistant strenght is impossible. One day it is too strong the next it is too weak.The machine itself is a pain to use.You have to dissasemble it after every use to clean it (too many pieces!)and be sure all parts are dry before you make another pot.I'm going back to my old $20 Braun and separate grinder."
1,Sadly Disappointed,"Have had the coffee pot for over one year and it continues to frustrate me. The carafe leaks when you pour coffee, so you end up with coffee all over the counter. In addition, it overflows while brewing about 25% of the time, so you really have to watch it. Started brewing coffee with the lid off the carafe to reduce spills while brewing. In summary, it's not worth the effort to fool with it any longer. Nice looking piece of junk!"
1,If you like cold coffe this is the coffe pot for you,"This coffee pot is nice looking, but is not functional. The coffee does not stay hot as described. The heat plate turns off, right after the coffee is brewed. Also, the coffee pot leaks."
2,Look elsewhere,"If you're looking for an excellent cup of coffee as soon as you wake up with minimal hassle, look elsewhere.The grind is quite coarse and has no coarseness adjustment. Add the fact that it uses a basket filter instead of a cone type and you end up with a cup of coffee that is frankly not very good when compared to my 10-year old Braun cone type maker.Also, look for a grinder/brewer designed so that steam does not rise up into the grinder assembly. It's a pain to clean and if you don't do it right away, the muck dries in the grinder and makes it even harder to clean.The only feature that I really like is the thermal carafe. It keeps the coffee hot for a long time without burning it."
3,"Good coffee, some work involved","We've had ours for about 1 month now, making coffee every day. Our only complaint is how diligent you need to be about cleaning the grinder after every pot. If you're having a party and need to make 3 pots, this would be a nuisance. But we make one pot in the morning (set it up the night before). When it finishes brewing, I pull out the grinder, rinse it out, leave it out to dry and we reassemble before we go to bed when we set the timer for the next morning. The coffee is great. The carafe is great, keeps coffee hot for at least 3 hours without burning. You just need to clean the grinder and dry it thoroughly before using again. I can't attest to its durability because we've only been using it for a month or so."
2,Severe leaks; TWICE,"I have had two of these coffee makers over the last three years. It was the most expensive coffee maker I have ever purchased, but I was very happy with the looks and the coffe it made. Unfortunately, after about 1 1/2 years it started to leak, especially when it was set up on a timer over night. Since it was under warranty, Cuisinart sent a replacement. Now two years later I have the same problem and it is getting worse. I have since found complaints of the same issue on other customer reviews. Cuisinart will not replace it again and there is no repair center to send it to. I am happy with its function but its reliability is poor. To compare, I had a medium priced Krups coffeemaker that I sent in for repair and had it returned within a week for just a $25 fee."
2,Expect it to die after a year (we've had two of these!),"I can't stress enough that you need to avoid this product. It starts out great, but doesn't seem to be very durable.Our first one broke within a year - it had a manufacturing issue that meant it poured coffee all over your countertop, instead of into the carafe. Our friends had the same problem with theirs. Cuisinart replaced it, but NOT for free.The replacement worked fine, until about a year after we got it. Then, the grinder dropped dead. I've cleaned it, lubricated it, you name it - but the grinder just won't grind any more. A quick google search for this model and ""won't grind"" brings up plenty of results."
4,Danger: Coffee Sludge,"I was beside myself with joy when this arrived at my home; I'm a serious coffee-drinker and have been limping around on a 4-cup Mr Coffee for some time. For the price, I figured it would be like magic, but as it turns out it's just another Earthly appliance. My main beef with this product is that steam from the brewing process is trapped in the chamber with the super-finely ground coffee. The entire inside of the machine gets coated with a muddy coffee-sludge after just one use. Also, I find whole beans ""glued"" to the lid of the grinder, which is a tragic waste in my opinion.Aside from the goo, however, the coffee is delicious (I especially like the charcoal filter for the water reservoir - fancy!) and the thermal carafe keeps it hot for a nice long time without burning it up."
3,It Leaks,We have used the DGB-600 BG for two or three years..good coffee..do not use the grinder and use paper filters...the problem is that we will come into the kitchen and find a lake of water that has released from the bottom of the coffee maker...it is not coffee but clelar water...We are at a -----to figure out what has happened...That is all....Cost $149.00 as a Christmas present...going to contact customer service for help.!
3,"nice, but.....","A nice machine, but a little difficult to use, set up is aesthetically pleasing, but not functional"
