5,Drop Quark and get it all right here!,"This is the best ""upgrade"" yet! If you're considering dropping Quark for InDesign, do it! Everything in the suite works seamlessly. InDesign is so far above Quark in every feature that it makes no sense not to go ahead and make the leap. Lots of your favorite features from Photoshop and Illustrator are integrated into InDesign--like layers, transparency, and the ability to import native files. I'm very happy I made this purchase and I recommend it to everyone!"
5,Beautiful !,This fit my wicker bassinet from the 1950's perfectly ! It is absolutely beautiful and looks much more expensive. It is worth every cent.
1,"Brutal Massecre, a comedy well maybe more of a joke","No way around it for me. Just a pathetic effort. Kind of embarrassing really. I've seen many movies with tiny budgetsthat soar on the creativity of thier creators. Not brutal massacre. Its a fine line between so bad its good and justso bad. Ed Wood is bad but good because he had a vision and he stuck to it. I sensed no underlying vision here soit just looks bad, sounds bad and theres nothing going on behind the scenes that made me believe that the people whoproduced this were anything more than a group of people who had an idea, raised a little money and made a cheapboring little movie. Sorry guys but do yourselves a favor and keep your day job."
1,Better luck next time!,"I really wanted to like this movie as I was a big fan of Stevan Mena's previous film Malevolence. Unfortunately, I found this recent effort lame, not funny at all and fairly boring. There are 1 or 2 mildly amusing scenes but no real laughs. I think Stevan should stick to horror..."
1,Disappointed,"I bought this movie just to see my friend acting and I was very disappointed. The plot stunk, the writing was worse, but I did enjoy seeing my old buddy. Love ya G.H.!"
4,good product,"This works as described. A little thin but not a problem as I place food-filled ceramic bowls on top of them for microwave heating. Although this is my experience, I shipped one to my brother and he said the plate center melted to the point of destroying it's usefulness when he placed a popcorn bag on it in the microwave."
2,Progressive dinner plates,I have a set just like these that came from WalMart made by the same company I have had them for at least 2 years Walmart doesn't sell this brand anymore the old ones have scratch marks and the is all that is wrong with the new ones I have had for about 3 months and they are warped I guess from the microwave and it says they are microwaveable and you can freeze with them fat chance they don't even stack very good anymore
1,melting plates,"I agree with many of the reviews here, the plates melted at even short microwave cooking times. First they would slightly melt in the center of the plate, then they completely lost their shape."
1,Melting Plates,"Second use, they started melting. Thinner than I had expected. I will not buy any more of them. For the first use, they were fine."
3,Microwavable set of plates,"It is OK but when I put a hot pocket on it. The carboard holder which I put the hotpocket in, melted spot on the plate."
4,Used Every Day For Lunch At Work,"I have been using these plates for over 2 yrs, everyday for lunch. I place a new paper plate on the microwaveable plate, add my lunch of the day and carry it to the Kitchenette. I microwave the food, then carry it back to my office. When finished, the dirty paper plate goes in the trash and the ""clean"" microwaveable plate goes back in the drawer of my desk. Used this way for over 600 days with only a slight warpage. I expect this plate to last almost forever. I would not ever consider eating off this plate or trying to cut anything on it. The plastic is just too soft. But it does its job of supporting my paper plate and not melting. So it does the job for me."
4,Decent price Decent product.,"I've been looking for something like these for quite awhile. I use them to feed a bunch of feral cats in the area. The plate I had finally gave into the weather extremes and abuse by the lawn mower. :0 These seem much more durable and should last quite awhile. I use them for the cats, but I think I may order a set ot two for my use indoors. I like the lip on the plates, that's what makes plates like this hard to find. The lip keeps things that may be a little runny from running off the edge of the plate. They would be great for kids. I would recommend these plates for cats or humans."
1,Not worth it,"These are almost the worst ""microwave"" plates I've ever used. Sure, they don't get hot but if you need to microwave anything longer than 3 or 4 mins at a time, these plates will begin to melt. I've got some with melt-impressions where of the food I was reheating, some of them deep pits. You can't use regular flatware to cut meats or anything sitting on them cause the plastic is softer then the food and get cut too. And if you have anything that weighs more than the plate, you're going to have to use at least 2 hands to remove the plate from the oven since they aren't strong or ridged enough--I often grab a regular non-microwavable plate to slide these plates onto since I don't want the microwave plate to fold during removale. You're better off looking for better microwavable plates. I'm using the ones I have left as frisbies."
2,Pretty bad,"I bought 2 sets of these from another online vendor. Was looking for cheap, non-breakable plates for everyday use (including microwave). Can't cut anything on them as they gouge right away. ""Top rack dishwasher safe"" is moot when they don't fit in the top rack of a dishwasher...but I have used only Air Dry with them--so they've not been exposed to the heat from the dishwasher drying element. Yes, they microwave okay in the sense they don't get hot--but the hot food warps them. After a couple uses none of the plates were flat anymore. All in all? They are pretty bad and honestly not even worth the $2/plate I paid for them."
1,Plates Melted,The first time I used the plates was for bacon which I put between paper towels as has been recommended by many on this site.After three minutes the plate melted.Enough said.
2,Plates,"A little flimsey, they just don't keep their shape very well and they worp even on the top shelf in the dishwasher."
1,Poor Product,"I did not like this product. I use the microwave a lot for breakfast tv dinners. A number of them use reflective plates to cook part of the breakfast. The instructions on the tv dinner tell you to put part of the breakfast on the reflective plates and then put the reflective plate and the rest of the breakfast on a microwave plate and put it in the microwave. Well I tried this using one of these plates and the relective plate melted part of the plate. I guess the instructions on these plates tell you not to put reflective plates on them, but if that is the case and I cannot use them with these dinners then they are of no use to me."
1,poor product,Poor quality. Cheap quality. Useless product. Would not recommend this product to anyone. Waste of money. Plate do not hold firm when you hold it.
3,nice plates,My wife liked these plates so much I ordered two more sets! not too heavy. just right. Cant use in microwave if it is a greasy item. Wish it was available in other colors.The second plates order was warped.
2,slightly better than paper,"These are all right, but seriously not worth the money. They warp when they are heated in microwave and dishwasher. I do not know how long they will last. I ones that I paid 98 cents for from Wal Mart do much better than these. These are really to me disappointing."
1,Not microwavable,"I tried these plates for one meal. I microwaved two pot pies for four minutes and in the process ruined two of the plates. They are now warped, and the middle of each plate is melted. I don't know what they consider ""microwavable"", but this doesn't cut it in my book. Returning them ASAP. Don't waste your time and money on these."
2,microwave plates,"The plates are 10"" but tend to warp when used in the microwave. They are advertised as plates designed to be used in the microwave but they still warp. Would not recommend for purchase."
1,Plates Warp,"I was not happy with these. After microwaving a frozen pot pie (11 minutes recommended), I found that the plate had warped considerably."
1,Microwave Plates,The description on these plates does not state they are plastic. I do not useplastic plates and will be retuning these.
3,"Not so good, not so bad.","I got these plates a week ago. I think the quality is average. The major problem is that the plat is too flat and to thin. If you want to use it to hold a liquid dish, you would have a trouble."
3,Great but they scratch easily,"I bought a set of these plates to use for things we do not feel like using our heavy, nice plates for. We used to use paper plates for things like sandwiches, pizza etc, and decided to change to these instead.They are great in the microwave and dishwasher, but they do scratch very easily which is the only reason I gave 3 out of 5 stars."
1,Disappointed,"I agree with others that these plates are somewhat flimsy, tend to warp, and can scratch easy. But, the straw that broke the Camel's back is when I served spaghetti on them, the plates became permanently stained! I didn't even cook the spaghetti on the plates. I just served it on the plates to eat by the pool. Very disappointing."
3,Microwave Plates,"When purchasing something like this, it would be nice to see the real thing first. These turned out to be much thinner than I expected them to be. Thicker plates for microwaving would be better."
1,Don't think so,"I'm afraid to actually microwave anything on these plates. They don't look or feel like a quality product. I have them, but actually don't use them."
4,Jessica Simpson - With You,"With You is a nice bubblegum song. It has nice lyrics and the vocals are good. Its damn catchy though, love it or hate it it is VERY catchy. It is a nice song and it deserves all the recognition it has gotten. I personally think ""Newlyweds"" the tv show kicked off Jessica Simpsons career. Before, she didnt have a #2 album and a top 20 single as big as this. Overall, a nice piece of bubblegum fluff!"
3,Okay,Works fine. No problems with any of the connectors. Packaging was fine when I received it. Overall no problems and works to standard.
5,good cable,"this product is very strong, tha outer shielding is able to withstand abnormal wera and tear.good buy!"
5,Go cables!,"Yup... They connect my cable modem to my router, and my router to my computers. They transmit data back and forth. So far they have failed to burst into flames or snap off and poke me in the eye. So go patch cables (yay)."
1,Received a fake Belkin Cable,"I have been using Belkin Cat5 cables for a long time.They come with a stamp and specs on the wire and the connectors have a Belkin logo embedded in them.The one i received does not have the Belkin name anywhere on the wire and the connectors.Sure its a fake.If i had to buy any Cat5e i could have spent only $10 including shipping.May be this fake cable works good, but the seller should not deceive people by saying its a Belkin cable.Buyer beware."
2,DECEPTION,Yeah sure this cable does what it's supposed to. And it's only 12.99. Yeah right that's before the 8.00 shipping and handling you pay Tiger direct. BS
5,Does what it needs to do.,I go to Belkin a lot for my accesory needs. This worked just perfect. i used it to hook my Xbox360 to the router which is also a belkin router. A+
4,Were nice cable,"Wow, what a cable. It's fast as a ligthning and it's made of good matrials that keeps it going, year after year"
5,Great Cat-5 Cable,"Blazing speed and good strength make this a winning choice for your network needs. Really affordable too, thirteen bucks for 100 feet. Nice, snagless cable ends as well. I've had no problems since installing this product and would quickly recommend it to others."
3,I liked this lotion quite a bit. It ...,"I liked this lotion quite a bit. It soaked in quickly and didn't leave behind any greasy or sticky feeling. The smell was a little strange but it faded after a bit. What I really liked was that I didn't get itchy anywhere I used it, which happens with a lot of lotions. I have a friend with very sensitive skin and I suggested this to her."
2,Although this baby lotion worked fine for moisturizing ...,"Although this baby lotion worked fine for moisturizing my 17-month-old daughter's skin, I found that I really didn't care for the scent at all. It was slightly medicinal, not what I typically think of when I think """"baby lotion."""" I much prefer the soft baby smell of the more popular brands on the market. Plus I think it's rather expensive for not really doing anything extra in the way of helping keep my daughter's skin soft and fresh smelling. I probably wouldn't buy this or recommend it to friends or family."
4,QUITE GOOD,"I LIKE THIS MOVIE VERY MUCH. IT IS A SLOW PACED MOVIE WITH TIME FOR REFLECTION. IT SHOWS THE UGLY SIDE OF HUMANITY. MEN AND WOMEN SPOILED BY AMBITION AND GREED AND MANIPULATED BY A WOMEN IN SEARCH OF REVENGE. THE HORRIBLE REALITY OF PEOPLE WHICH ARE ABUSED IS THAT THEY BECOME AND ACQUIRE MANY OF THE DISGUISTING TRAITS OF PEOPLE THAT ABUSE THEM. A WOMAN THAT IS ABUSED BECOMES A WORLD REKNOWN PROSTITUTE AND SEEKS REVENGE ON THE MAN THAT ABUSED HER. IN DOING SO SHE MANHUNTS THIS MAN BY PURCHASING ALL OF HER VILLAGE, THEREFORE TURNING HER HATRED ON LIFE TO AN EPIDEMIC PROBLEM IN HER VILLAGE."
3,It's very lively,"The actors were very credible, you can imagine better the poverty of the people there. It's very lively with the landscape. But there's one thing we would like to know: the end; because it is very unclear, too open. It's the perfect film to make people identifying themselves with the actors."
4,Our opinion,"Our opinion about this film is very positive, because it is set in the nature. The actors aren't famous and so they act freely and naturally. The film shows that many people are ready to kill someone for money. It's just one thing we'd like to know about this film: How does his death happen? We think that's the most important scene in this story and there is not enough information given."
2,The Swiss Review,"We find that this film isn't very good. We find it not interesting. The story is very complicated if you haven't read the book. To us the plot is too far away from Dürrenmatt's play. We can't compare the actors from the book with the actors from the film, because we had some problems identifying the people. (e.g. Linguère Ramatou = Claire Zachanassian) Something was good: the story was set in the nature. We recommend to read the book first and then watch the film."
2,Hyenas,"I think the film is not bad, the landscape and the nature are very beautiful. But the film is too different from the book. The people in this film don`t speak German, but the text is translated. (The film is dubbed.)The actors aren`t very good, they aren`t very famous. The story isn`t very realistic. We think still that this film is interesting, but we wouldn`t watch this film again. written by Dominik and Thomas"
2,My opinion,"I think this film is good for people who want to see something special. I don`t like it very much, because to me, ""Hyenas"" is a little bit complicated. This film plays in the nature and the actors act naturally, BUT it is boring! I`ve seen another film like ""Hyenas"". This one is spoken in Swiss-German. To me, that is the better one. The name is ""The visit from the old lady"". The plot is the same, but more interesting."
3,Hyenas,"Our opinion about this film is good. The actors act very naturally, but they aren't very famous actors.The landscape is very beautiful. The film is set in a very nice place. It's negative, because the text and the names aren't based on Dürrenmatts' play. You see, that the people are very poor! The film is too different from the book."
3,Braun CCR2 Cleaner Refill Kit works O.K. but expensive!,Braun CCR2 Cleaner Refill Kit works O.K. but expensive! I have reordered this item several times and it works O.K.
3,Worth it?,"Expensive, but you're captive once you buy the electric razor. Is it worth it? Probably not. Easier to buy a wet/dry, clean it yourself, and replace the blades occasionally."
3,Braun Cleaner Refills,"These refills are not available on Okinawa. So, I'm forced to buy them online. This was the least expensive option, but still a bit pricey."
3,I can't believe I'm the first reviewer- this is hysterical,Jay Hickman is very risque - Nevertheless if you don't have one of his CD's (they all have alot of duplication) you haven't heard some of the funniest material performed live - Beware; he makes Red Foxx sound tame.
3,Thelma and Louise do Italy!,"Two lovely young girls (a pretty blonde and her butchy brunette girlfriend) fall in love working together at a gas station/luncheonette, and then are forced to run away after they accidentally kill the mother of the pretty blonde. Along the way they have a run in with a couple of drunken guys and their equally blotto girlfriend, all of which leads to a fiery conclusion. There's lots of sub-titled dialogue in between, including the ghost of the pretty blonde girl's mother telling her what she should do. Also, some surprisingly sexy moments, including a hot make-out session in a public bathroom between the two young women. Interesting, but too action-oriented for an erotic flick and not enough action for an adventure flick."
5,One of My Own is a must mystery,"First- One of MY Own is must reading for anyone who needs to know and understand in detail how invitro fertilization works from the provider point of view.One of MY Own is a primer for doctors to recommend to their patients for deep information and clear enjoyment.MY reaction to One of MY Own was to enjoy the mystery. Thecharacters are well drawn by Sandra Feder; they have real feeling, make real decisions. Some of the main characters take the wrong road and do some bad things. How the good peopleinvolved are brought into the tide of events, in a wonderfulnatural way, brings a high level of excitement. I think one of MY Own is an excellent book."
4,What a suspenseful adventure!,"What a suspenseful mystery novel, Ms Feder weaves. You don't want to put it down because what's next is unpredictable. As in Side Effects, her first mystery, science is woven into the plot, so that in the end you have a new level of understanding of genetics and DNA in One of My Own.The mix of characters, complex human beings all yearning to know who they are, work through their own deep emotional pain and face the past as their destiny unravels.One of my litmus tests for a good novel is whether it remains in my consciousness; and this one does. I look forward to the next mystery Sandra Feder writes. Thanks for the emotional roller coaster adventure, full of surprises!"
4,Great Work,"I really enjoyed Sandra Feder's ""One Of My Own"". It was practical, written for every day people to read and the anticipation that she left you with at the end of each chapter, made you keep going and reading into the night, long after you should have gone to sleep."
1,Does not work,"First time using it and the back seal pop off instantly. Thought too myself I'm putting too much pressure so I tried to go slow next time around, same time, could not even produce 2 slice of jerky before the back keep popping off. Returning and trying something higher quality."
3,cracked,"it cracked after a few uses, but it still works. the jerkey comes out well once you get a rhythm going. not bad for the price"
1,Punctured seasoning packet,"This comes as prepackaged (labelled on the box) but apparently they didn't pay close attention when packing this one. Some of the seasoning packets were old/hard, and one of the Teriyaki packs was actually punctured."
2,Unpredictable,"I used it twice. It worked as expected the first time, but the second time it kept failing. The cap separated from the tube. At first I thought it was me. But after a second attempt it failed again and again."
5,Great product. Great Value.,Nothing bad to say. Works as advertised. Great assortment of spices and ample cure included.
4,Easy to use.,Makes for a quicker start to finish. Breaks down for simple cleaning and the attachments are great. Recommend.
2,Less than a year and it is broken,"So disappointing. Less than a year and it broke. I don't use it than often, just like every couple of months. I don't give it one star because when it was working it worked pretty good."
1,What a waste of paper,"This has got to be the worst series I have ever read. My children NEVER used such poor grammar, even when first learning to talk! Junie is a rude, obnoxious, disrespectful little brat. Definitely not a character I want my children reading about. What this author is thinking, I can't imagine. But I know I won't be supporting her by buying any of her trash."
2,even my five year old thought she was mean,"The story is about a little girl who has to ride the bus for the first time. She is very rude to her mom, teacher, and other students. My child even thought she was mean."
1,Junie B. is a bad role model,"This book might catch your child's interest - but it is likely to be in the same way that a smart aleck kid from the neighborhood might - and it is not a positive way!The grammar is poor - as an adult I understand that it's done for humorous effect; but my child doesn't get that! And Junie is rude, bossy, and she name calls; again, not the behavior I want my child emulating.Overall, the books seem entertaining but not really beneficial in any other way; there are many better books out there to hold the attention of young readers.* UPDATE: I am editing this review to just add my insight that this series of books is better suited to children ages 7 and up = I see now that kids of that general age range are much better equipped to identify the silliness of the characters and empathize with them by understanding why they act as they do - much better for second graders than kindergarteners or first graders - just my added two cents. Now that we are older, we enjoy them more."
1,Junie B. Jones . . . I'm not impressed,"Okay, I don't think that the words ""hate"" and ""stupid"" are words that should come out of a Kindergarteners mouth as much as they do Junie B. Jones' mouth. I bought several of these books on the recommendation of my sister, who is a second grade teacher and the myriad of recommendations online. When I began reading them to my 5 (almost 6 year old daughter), who is also in Kindergarten, I realized that I had to reword most of the dialogue as I was reading The books are certainly humorous to us adults and strike a chord with those of us raising children in this age group, but I don't think the misspellings and poor usage of the English language is very educational or entertaining."
1,Absolutely Horrible,"I don't even know where to begin. These books are so horrible, and not just for the fact that the character of Junie B is a mean, bratty, ignorant, pathetic excuse of a kid. I fully realize that the grammatical errors and misspelled words are put in there on purpose for so-called humorous effect, but when you have 1st and 2nd graders reading this and you have to keep explaining that it is not correct to say ""bestest"" or ""funnest"" or ""I runned to her house..."" well, it gets highly annoying. I would not recommend these books to anyone."
1,Sets the WORST possible example for a young reader. AVOID!,"My 5 1/2 year old daughter got this book as a Christmas present. Supposedly the main character Junie B. is the same age as my daughter. But I was astonished when we read the book together because throughout the book, Junie is disrespectful, mean, and constantly talking about beating up a classmate. WHAT?! Is this quality reading for a kindergartner (or even a 1st, 2nd or 3rd grader)? I don't see the appeal of having to explain to my daughter while reading every page, why Junie is not nice, acting inappropriately and wanting to beat kids up. Seriously?! I don't expect my daughter to be reading books that have a moral every time, but c'mon! There are plenty of other good fiction books out there where the main characters have fun, even get into trouble, without being such terrible examples to their reading audience. I would have given this book zero stars if I could have, as this is hands down one of the worst books I have ever seen."
1,"funny yes, but filled with bad grammar, bad behavior etc.",Upon recommendation from friends I borrowed this book for my daughter. Within the first two pages I was completely turned off by Junie's poor grammar and how rude she is. These may be funny stories but encouraging such poor language and behavior is unecessary. I returned the book without sharing it with my daughter and am now looking for other series books to share with her.
1,Chelsy's Review,i dont think you should read this book because you might enjoy it too much then youll get addicted. you shouldnt get adicded to reading becuse if you read instead of play outside your tummy will get plumpshery and you will get fatty . then when you try to exersiz your tummy wio woble around .im a 5 yer old hwo hats reding becuse your tummy wil get plumpshery annd a girl called milly is in my clas and she reds so her tummy is plumpshery so when i se her i kick her bely to tel her not to red so you shod not red much oderwise your tummy will get plumpshery.
1,anti-intellectual,"This book and the series in general appear to be part of the wave of ignorant-is-good anti-intellectualism drowning our culture. We were given a few books from the Junie B. series to read aloud to our son, who loves Beverly Cleary. Needless to say, the comparison is inapt (and insulting to Ms Cleary). I'm happy this author (?) can crank these out so readily (yet such frenetic production should be a red flag about quality), but reading an ill-written, unrealistic story with an unrepentantly rude antihero to your child squanders the time you spend trying to have a positive influence on him/her."
2,Terrible Grammar And Disrespectful Children,"Writing about the first experiences of a child taking a bus to school is a good subject to read to children to help them better understand the process. However, author Karen Park writes characters that openly disrespect their parents and teachers. The language is also a bit much for a 5 or 6 year old, and words that are not appropriate to say out loud in school and should not be praised. The incorrect grammar is also something that children should not read or study. Before they can understand what is wrong about a sentence, they need to first learn the correct way of writing and proper sentence structure. I was very disappointed in this book and will not buy any more Junie B. Jones titles. Be warned."
2,Not Completely Ergonomic,"The photo shows a keyboard that looks ergonomic (i.e., designed to avoid repetitive movement injury). However, an important feature is missing. Unlike the Microsoft Natural keyboard, this one does not have an arch built into the top so that the hands slightly face each other. Instead the top surface of the keyboard is flat. This lack of ergonomic design defeats the purpose of buying this kind of keyboard. I have found that a touchpad like the one on this keyboard is very helpful because it avoids the need to reach out and strain your wrist for mouse usage, and it's a shame Microsoft's keyboard does not offer this. The price is good, and the keyboard seems to have quality construction. Because I was expecting complete ergonomic features, Amazon was gracious in taking it back."
2,"Looks good, but...",Touchpad on this keyboard is convenient and is properly located but the right and left click keys are inconveniently located. The cord is short and the keyboard software is not compatible with Windows XP. The return policy on this product was quite cumbersome.
2,Great Ergonomics - Poor Construction,"I had a keyboard like this before, but it was in all one piece. For some reason they have decided to split the mouse section from the keyboard, and it was a poor design choice. Being able to split your arms wider with the ergonomic keyboard will make you a faster typist. but the small touch pad in lieu of a mouse is poorly placed, and the part that it rests on kept coming apart from the main keyboard. Plus the touch pad is not very sensitive. I finally just gave it to the thrift shop and went back to a one-piece keyboard. Too bad."
4,Keyboard above average,"I bought this keyboard because I wanted a keyboard with a touchpad, since I haven't been able to use a mouse consistently without having some arm pain. I thought having the touchpad on the right instead of the center would be more comfortable but turns out it's not. It's ok where it is but I think center may have been even better. I like the layout of the keyboard though it did take some getting used to the split and slant between left and right hand. But now that I've been using it awhile I really like it. All in all I think it's a good keyboard."
1,Dud,This is the first item I have purchased from Amazon that I thought was a dud. It comes in a very low third compared to Celtic Thunder and Celtic Woman. After watching it once I have no wish to watch again and again like I do Celtic Woman.
4,Worth the price for the violine solo alone.,This was on PBS and I just had to have it. For fans of Celtic it is a must. Good versitile performers that love performing and it shows. Has been available a while but well worth watching over and over again. Hope they get to do more DVDs in the future.
1,Low budget shlock,"You would expect an action movie with good stars like Hopper and Madsen to have something going for it...NOPE! This video is a serious letdown. The plot is amatuerish and hackneyed, the dialogue is pathetic, and the story on the whole is dissapointing and BORING!!DON'T waste your money on this piece of low budget trash like I did. Shame on Madsen and Hopper!!"
1,Whatever you do don't buy this!!,"I recieved this T.V. as a gift. After about two years it started to malfunction and become ""snowy"". I have taken it to be fixed three times and they can't fix it. It started to mess up just after the warranty expired. Don't waste your money."
1,Not worth your time or money,"I purchased this television for the kitchen counter, almost as soon as I got it home it malfunctioned."
2,ugh,"If you have heard of brothers Mark and Jack long who starred in famous movies like '7 Grandmasters' and 'Ninja Checkmate' then you can probably guess why I was forced to watch this movie. Add in director Lee Tso-Nan and I thought this movie was destined for greatness. Then I see Jack Long fighting little kids and some of the stupidest and lowest production value ever for on of these type of magic movies. The final fight was kind of fun as was seeing Jack Long fight and the villian was definitely my favorite character. Mark Long should be embarrassed for his part in the and I really cannot recommend this flick to anybody, except those people who just live for bad films. If you are looking for a similar type of movie to this then check out Yuen Woo-Ping's 'Shaolin Drunkard' or 'Taoism Drunkard'. And if you are looking for something REALLY crazy then check out 'Boxer's Omen' which was released recently."
2,Porter Cable what happened?,"I needed a tile saw and went with the Porter Cable brand as I have had very good luck with their other tools. This tile saw, however, was very dissapointing.It is very loud: I mean the neighbors complained.The sliding table never worked smoothly, and after two days of use it became very uneven. The wheels jam in the tracks producing erractic cuts. I attempted to adjust the mechanism, but there is really no practical way to improve matters. Seems to be poorly engineered.The saw itself is smoothe and cuts well.I wrote to Portar Cable, but received no reply."
2,Junk,"Overall very dissapointed with the saw. My wife bought this saw for me. I was able to complete one bathroom tile job with it (40 sq ft) but the saw broke as I started on my second bathroom. Now the saw makes a horrific noise when started; seems the gears stripped themselves. The saw is very loud and the miter table does not slide smoothly, causing erratic cuts. Before it broke, it did cut tiles ok. I would buy another saw if I could and I am currently trying to send the Porter Cable back to Amazon."
1,Terrible value for the price,"I had a $48 QEP saw before this wildly overpriced Porter Cable [one] and the $48 saw cut tiles more efficiently and accurately than this garbage. The bearings on my ...PC saw stripped within 6 months and I was told by my PC dealer it had to be caused by improper use, not faulty bearings. ...I will never buy a PC product again. Lousy saw and even worse customer service support. Buy it if you have to have lousy durability with a Proter Cable tag glued on it."
4,I'm satisfied,"I've had this saw for over a year and have cut a LOT of tile with it. I've been pleased overall with its performance. The only complaints I have is the noise (ear plugs definately required) and my tabe is very sightly warped (because it sat out in the sun for a week). I would prefer a metal table with a miter attachment but I'm not willing to pay hundreds more for that. My table rolls smoothly and the cuts are always clean and accurate. Other tile cutters in this price range can only rip 12"" tiles which is what ultimatly led me to buy the Porter Cable."
3,A very helpful guide,"However... if you need help with an unruly or disorganized board, this book will NOT work for you. Joyce Stephens assumes that your board runs correctly and that you have such things as a parlimentarian on board. She even has a section on chosing the proper gavel. If your board lacks direction or does not function properly, this book will not help you run a successful meeting. But for newly elected presidents, this book can impart some very helpful information that should put anyone at ease right from the first board meeting."
3,Olmstead,"The book was in good shape when delivered. However, the content was not what I had expected. It was not very informative about the life and times of Frederick Law Olmstead.James H. Allen"
2,No Quality Control,"Wiper motor functions perfectly well, except that the motor is extremely noisy. You couldn't hear the OEM motor. However, I have to turn the radio on so I don't have to hear this replacement wiper motor. So, the price wasn't so good after all. Aren't there any QC people at cardone?"
4,How to Start a Training Program/ Carolyn Nilson,"How to Start a Training Program/ Carolyn NilsonWhat a great book. Definitely, a book I would recommend for any training program. A systematic guide on how to start a training program from training policy and standards to needs analysis and delivery and presentation tips. One of my favorite parts of the book was chapter 9 Delivery options and presentation tips, where it points out several different presentation and training methods and discusses each one. I also liked the train the trainer section where it gives you all the topics that need to be discussed while conducting the training. This is a great guide and I am very happy I bought it."
5,So far - so great,We ordered this for my father-in-law who will be visiting us and another brother-in-law a couple of times each month. He is in a wheelchair but can stand up with a lot of help. We had no problem moving him into this bed. The height was perfect. As for the comfort - he fell asleep within 5 minutes and in the morning said it was great. It inflated and deflated quickly and we were easily able to take it to my brother-in-law's for Dad's next visit there.
1,Pricey and Leak!,"Just hung up from Coleman service line. There's no way that I can send in the leak airbed and get it fix. :( You would think that big company must have some kind of repair option, but what the rep told me, in short, ""use soapy water to find the leak and to go target to get a patch"" GREAT advise, isn't it?I think many experience airbed only when you have guests over, on daily basis there's no way you would know. Airbed is something you should buy when you need, and return right after!Final note... this is Coleman everyone, a leading outdoor gear company. REI never do this to customer."
4,Sparkling with witty dialogue and a hero after my own heart.,"This great movie captures the spirit of the book--with several improvements on the original too. David Niven gives a wonderful portrayal of Sir Percy Blakeney(bart.) Although the film was made a long time ago, the characters' refreshing sincerity comes through.The film starts off in the typical ""Scarlet Pimpernel"" method--France, Mme. la Guillontine, the old hag, a thrilling carriage chase--but as it progresses, it starts to take on a familiar, yet refresshingly unique look.My favourite part is when--. Sorry, I really musn't spoil the movie.""The Elusive Pimpernel"" is available now. Watch this movie and you will come to love it as much as I do."
4,awsome game,this game is good but isnt the best.out of 15 stars i would probly give it a 16 to 20 stares.
5,GREAT VIDEO!!!,"If you have come into the knowledge that the children of Israel were all black people including Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, this would be a great video for you to have in your collection!This movie is base on the lost of Joseph and the rape of Dinah, Jacobs daughter ALSO shows that Esau was red skin (white)!This video is in the Bambara language with English subtitles"
2,Poor Quality,The quality of this movie was very poor. So poor that it could not be viewed and the subtitles were very hard to read.
5,Elasticity in Engineering Mechanics,"This is an excellent textbook for senior undergraduate and starting graduate students. The book provides the necessary mathematical background at the beginning. As a result, readers do not have to long math book before embarking on this mechanics book. The book also stricks a bood balance of mathematic rigor and conceptual intuition. Graduate students can take this book as a starting point, and dive into more advanced books, if they choose to major in mechanics. The book is a good syngergy of various chapters - linkage is made from one chapter to another. I find this very informative. Overall, I like the book very much."
5,really a guide,"Very good guide to DSP. It is complete, in-depth, explanatory and of great quality! I really recommend it if you are interested in DSP and studying it."
1,Not worth your money,"It's 2010 and I got the 2008 version. Kuwait has changed a lot since 2008 so this version has become pretty useless.Also, I couldn't install it using my Mac.. I had to dig out my old PC computer to complete the installation.The Garmin website ([...]) does not allow me an upgrade from 2008, so I will have to attempt contacting their customer service and see if there's anyway I could get an upgrade instead of buying a new map for $189.99."
2,Meh,"This was slightly uncomfortable to use because water always overflowed out of it and somehow wasn't as cushion like as expected. It also got a tear/hole after a week or two. Used patch. Sprung a leak again. Got another one. Same thing. Ended up getting a hard plastic one with overflow holes that allow water to flow back into the toilet. Much better, and ironically, more comfortable! The harder plastic one is also a little easier to clean. Would have given another star if it had lasted longer. Minus one star for comfort, and another for clean-ability/water over flow (not that you can't clean it, just that the cushion-y plastic moves around and is harder to clean, that's all)"
1,Worse Fit Ever!!!,"I bought these pants thinking that they would flatter my figure. When they arrived it was quite the contrary. They completely flattened by rear end, made my hips appear squared off and the waist was very high. I have a 40"" hip measure so for a pair of jeans to flatten it all out is quite remarkable. My advice is if you have curves and want to flaunt them don't buy these jeans."
1,Only those with hearing disability would accept this EMI recording ...,"How anyone with good hearing and with a half-decent playback system, (CD player, Amps, Speakers) could ""enjoy"" this EMI recording, or give them a serious consideration - is beyond me and probably beyond anyone who claims to have a decent pair of ears:In order to enjoy what Rattle and the orchestra are doing, one have to discern what he or she is hearing. Though some of rattle's recording with this orchestra, same hall, are acceptable (no more than that), here, with this EMI sound engineering it is impossible.The sound comes from farther than mid-hall, it is drawn in excessive reverberation, mist, fog...What a waste of what could have been an interesting reading by Mr. Rattle...Go figure out what possessed the sound engineering of this CD. It's a joke."
2,It doesnt reveal anything.,"It doesn reveal anything,it just tells the story that something happend down there."
3,Tiny!,"When they say miniature, they mean it! The books and type are teeny! I suggest buying larger, more legiable versions of the best: Jemimia Puddle-Duck, Tom Kitten, Flopsy Bunnies, Peter Rabbit. With a version this small you can't see any of the illustrations."
2,Be warry of font sizes.,"This service is great for the demographic except for one thing. The maximum font size you can program in the system is 16 point. While most folks in their elderly years can read 16 point type, there are individuals that need their text even larger.It worked fine for my great aunt until a few months ago when her sight started to deteriorate even more.The company has stated they can't program the system to go any larger than 16 point type. I find this disturbing because they are reducing their demographic considerably for more than likely simple changes to a line of their code.Not much foresight on their part."
5,Presto email a big hit!,"I purchased the HP Printing Mailbox for my 83 yr. old mother. We have the service set to check her mailbox and print the contents twice a day. She lives alone and ""lives"" to see what has been sent to her by the ""authorized"" senders (family, and friends). She says she feels like there are family and friends ""in the house with her"". The mailbox is simple in its ease of maintenance. Paper and ink cartridge are easy to change. A great system for families to be able to email their elders that have no computers!"
1,50% rate increase after 1st year of service $99-->$150,"What a ripoff! This is why I stopped doing business with the cable company. Once they have you prisoner - they hike the rates regularly. My first one year subscription is up at the end of the month and I just got a notice they are raising the service rate from $99/year to $150.00/year and why. It runs on my phone line, with my paper and my ink and they hardly even store anything since it downloads every 24 hours. Last I checked the cost of Internet access and connectivity has been going down for the last 20-30 years. Mine will be for sale here or on eBay soon used. WE ARE NOT RENEWING AT 50% more per year."
1,Be Warned: Will Not Work With Digital Phone Line,"My grandparents and I were thrilled with the prospect of their receiving email messages and pictures without a computer. The thrill was short lived when the HP printer quit working, after transmitting one message. We had techs from the cable company and electronics store come take a look, and it was discovered that the HP Presto Printer will not work with common digital cable phone lines. When I called Presto they confirmed that the machine will not, in fact, work with a digital phone line. This REALLY should be stated in the product's description. Disappointing."
4,Presto/HP Printing Mailbox -,"This is an excellent niche product. We bought it for my folks who are in assisted living to communicate with them, send them photos, remind them about appointments, when we'd be there, etc. Each time we go there I find a pile of messages from us and other family members. The monitoring of ink and paper is very good and the quality of print of the photos is quite good. Only other requirement I'd like to see them add is the capability to know when your note was printed to assure me it has been delivered, or a queue to show the administrator what volume and sources of notes have arrived over the recent period of time. Now if we could just get them to remember what they've read..."
5,Presto Mailbox is perfect for my mother,"My mother is 85 and has felt left out when it came to emails since all of her kids and grandkids are always talking about emailing each other or texting. The Presto Mailbox printer has worked wonderfully for her. We are all able to send her emails and pictures that she just has to pick up out of the printer with no effort on her part. I just make sure the paper is filled up and that the ink isn't low, and she's good to go. She loves being in the loop and now gets more news about things going on with family members, as well as current pictures. It was well worth the money."
5,Presto Mailbox Printer,Works great. Easy to use and keeps her better informed. She loves receiving photos of grandkids and great grandkids.
5,My grandmother loves it!,"The Presto mailbox does what HP claims ... it just works! Set up took just a few minutes and my 95 year old grandmother was getting e-mails, including attached pictures, etc. And she doesn't have to do anything except take the pages out of the tray.The paper tray and ink cartridge are easy to load. And the unit is very quiet. More quiet, in fact, than my much-more-expensive inkjet printer."
1,Do not buy....huge rip off,"I bought this product and it is the such a big ripoff.$99 per year for email? $22 for ink cartridges? Good thing grandma has Mediacare and Social security....too bad taxpayers pay for them.HP should be ashamed for marketing this to elderly people....it is such a rip off.Ink jet printers are the biggest rip off in the IT industry....$22 for 10ml of liquid. That works out to $8000 per gallon. If HP had an ounce of ethics, they would release a laser printer version of this service (laser printers are usually much more cost-effective compared to ink jet printers)."
3,power cord outdated,"everything worked fine until i stepped on the prongs of the power cord-the two prongs that you plug in to the wall-and ruined it.This cord comes in two parts, an adapter with a three prong holes, and the short cord with my ruined prongs. So i ordered a new cord (for only 11 dollars),but they just sent me the adapter part that i don't need.So i called HP and they told me that they don't have that part,don't sell it. They gave me a phone number which I called--and that guy keeps giving me the run-around-and didn't call back.The adapter that takes a 2-pronged cord is easy to get-but my adapter end connects to 3-pronged which ,with a 2 foot wire and my bent progs plugs into the wall."
5,"Grandma can NOW receive e-mails, withOUT a computer!!!","Heard about this, my wife's Uncle got his mother one of these gadgets and it has worked SO well, I bought one for my mom. Easy, effective, what else do you want?"
5,Great for Mom!,"This was perfect for my elderly mother who is not ""on-line"". It was very easy to hook up (I wasn't even there) and managing online is easy. We had a few bugs in setting up the delivery times (took a few days for it to sync with five delivery times instead of three)and at first I was frustrated by many calls for service in which I received many different answers, but it was finally resolved and has worked perfectly since.Having the youngest grandchildren 3000 miles away, it has cheered my mother immensely to get daily pictures of my boys. Very worth it!"
4,E-Box,"Service is steep, but my 85 year old mother feels closer to her far-flung family with her HP online mailbox. Handles attachments automatically, is easy to maintain, and the stylized fonts help to make it fun for seniors."
3,Just OK,"I purchased this product for my parents because I want then to be informed by e-mailing them articles that may interest them. This was also purchased so that pictures can be sent, especially since they have their first great-grandchild on the opposite coast. Unfortunately, you can't use photo paper in the machine which was a big disappointment. I'm still going to have to send them picture DVDs. Otherwise it works fine for the family needs."
5,FANTASTIC!,"Really thrilled with this purchase. Haven't seen my parents this excited about a gift in a long time. They are unable to drive so they now feel ""connected"" with the rest of the family. Can't recommend it enough for parents, grandparents, or anyone without a computer. Love, Love, Love it."
4,"Good, once it worked","We ordered our Presto printer for my mother in law. The first one we received was faulty and it took awhile to determine that. We called customer service and they sent us a new one, free of charge. The original seller did not want the broken one back. Mom seems to like the printer, now it's just getting the grandkids to remember to send her stuff."
5,Great Grandma's Presto Printer,"I bought this as a Mother's Day present for my mother. After setting up an account on Presto.com,I plugged it in, put in the ink cartridge & paper and it was ready to use! She loves getting emails and pictures from her family. I highly recommend this for anyone who has no intention of ever owning a computer. One of the best features, no unwanted emails since her account is monitored by me. I can even tell when her ink cartridge is low by checking her account online! Amazon had this item $50 less than on Presto.com"
2,not such a good deal,"My mother (age 94) has had a Presto for about 3 or 4 years. She enjoys getting the mail.BUT --*The printer did not last long. We had to replace it after two years. The hinges that support the cover are flimsy and one broke, which then interfered with the machine knowing if the cover were open or closed. We lived with it like that for a few months but eventually it died and we replaced it for her.*The ink cartridges are a MAJOR expense. My mother is not happy having to shell out $40 or so every 4-8 weeks for ink. (This little device is a very, very clever product to make money for HP!) Because it uses a multi-color cartridge, the machine says you have ""Low ink"" when any of the colors runs out, even if you have plenty of the other colors. Tremendous waste of money.*Some email attachments cannot be printed.*Machine seems to jam more often than most printers. Not sure why.Having said that, i have not yet found a better solution."
1,Dialing out to access Presto Service,"May 2007 Update - 5 Stars *****: PRESTO fixed our dial-out problem. We worked with them directly and they sent us an HP Printing Mailbox customized for our situation. Now HP Printing Mailbox works just fine. Recommend checking with Presto if your connectivity needs are different from the standard offering.March 2007 Connectivity Concern: We are unable to use the PRESTO Service due to the phone network setup at our assisted living community. We must dial a '7' to get an outside line. At the present time, March 2007, the HP Printing Mailbox is capable of dialing an '8' or a '9' to access an outside line. Had to return printer."
5,Love it!,"My 95 year old mom is deaf. We could not communicate on the phone at all any more. This machine has changed her life....and ours! She now knows what's happening in the family and her outlook on life is renewed!The machine works great. I'm the acct manager and she receives mail 4 times a day. The presto staff is wonderful-very responsive. All the things you need to do and change as acct manager are easily accessible. Highly recommend this product. The only drawback is that the ink goes quickly, buy a spare."
5,Presto is perfect,"Not only do my in-laws enjoy getting photographs, emails and a couple of the Presto sponsored newsletters - which range from Wall Street Journal health info and Andy Rooney to crossword puzzles - but the HP customer service folks are terrific. Plus they told me they've fixed the dial-9-to-get-an-outside line problem. Whether it's 9, 8 or another number, Presto can accommodate it. What a gem for a niche market."
5,"TAZ 13 has done it again, dope dance music for the feet ,ear","This series is constanly putting out great dance, freestyle music for our listening enjoyment. All tracks are great , but there are some that stand out ,the remix of NOTHIN' GOIN' TO CHANGE MY LOVE, is by far one of the best,innovated,fun, full of bass, dope harmony by Pure Pleasure.cruising stuff"
2,"It's a round pillow...nothing more, nothing less","I don't have a glowing review of this product because I guess I expected more. It's just a round shaped pillow. It's probably too soft to do any re-posturing, but I don't know what I expected."
3,Maybe not for a 6 yr old.......,"Initally I loved the idea of this gift for my 6 yr old daughter (who LOVES ""gadgets"") But when we opened the package..the pieces to assemble on the mask are a little tricky to get on (angles and what not) and the voice control doesn't necessarily work all of the time! All in all it's a fun toy for her and she does enjoy running around with her little sister and playing with it!"
4,Giggle Gear,"I bought this for my 4 year old for Christmas, and we got lots of laughs. My 2 year old even likes to play with it. Only problem is it doesn't have an automatic off and if you stop using it without shutting the microphone off it will burn out the batteries. Otherwise great toy."
4,Hit of the day!,"I got the fun fairy and the alien/bug masks for all the kids under 7 in my family, and oh my, didn't EVERYONE love to play with them! I had my 32 yo partner walking around pretending to be a robot. They are a blast, easy to get ready for play, and have enough versatility to keep kids entertained for quite a stretch. The one small quibble is the mouth pieces on one of the masks didn't fit tightly enough, so you had to hold it in place for the voice modulator to work. great toy, another success for Cranium."
5,Great Book!!!,"My son is 9 years old and hates chapter books, he would much rather be reading non-fiction. When I found the Chet Gecko series at the store, I took a chance and bought the first book. At first my son refused to read it, but after reading the first two chapters aloud as a bedtime story, he was hooked. He has since read all of the Chet Gecko novels and loves each and every one. I have read most of them to my students, (I teach reading recovery in a middle school)and they have always been a huge hit. While he may not be reading Chaucer, I am very happy to see him reading chapter books and enjoying himself. My six year old daughter also loves having the books read to her. I would recommend the Chet Gecko to any child, boy or girl, as a great introduction to mystery novels, detective stories, and bad puns."
5,Wish I had invented this!,Wow...this fork is awesome! The ability to clean an area (i.e. under the chicken roost) and be able to spread two full wheelbarrow loads of the magic gold around to my garden and plants was so easy. I suffer with arthritis and I'm always game to try anything that will help make my hobby more enjoyable! I highly recommend this item! P.S. Don't let its featherweight fool you ...it truly is almost indestructible!
4,Top notch poly fork,"This is one of the two best brands on the market. It stands up to boot shoving into the compost bin to turn manure, picking up in the field through grass and weeds, you name it. I've been using it for four years. Other forks on the market didn't last 4 months. The only other comparable for durability is the Ames Featherlite which is just as hard to find as this model. If you can locate either, buy it. Buy two."
3,high expectations not met,"I bought this album for the same reason I believe most people do; I loved The Olivia Tremor Control and wanted to hear more. But, while this album is essentially the ""poppier"" parts of The Olivia Tremor Control, something is lost in the transition. Perhaps it is the absence of Will Cullen Hart, but for me the album did not live up to my expectations, and I found it somewhat disappointing. Not to say it's bad, but certainly Circulatory System and Pipes You See, Pipes You Don't are better spin-offs. And the last track, I hate to say, is utterly pointless... and this from someone who loves even Explanation II, which is entirely instrumental and mostly lacking melody. So I would say, if you're just looking to hear more OTC-type music, try the other side projects first. Keep in mind, music is completely objective, feel free to form your own opinion and disagree if you like."
2,High Maintenence,The problem with this device is that the ball is very smooth and will slip if it gets the least little bit of grease on it from a skin cream or even eating a potato chip. I use the mouse all day and had to switch to a trackball to avoid repetition injury. The only other mouse I've used is Logitech which is an optical mouse and requires no reqular cleaning. I'd definitely not buy Microsoft if you're a heavy user.
4,How to fix the dirt problem.,"I do not use any other mouse than this one. This mouse is the best mouse I have found to prevent Carpal Tunnel Syndrome. The claims of this mouse getting dirty are correct, however, I have found several ways of fixing it. The first thing I do is to use a Q-Tip cotton swab and isopropyl alcohol and clean the rollers. The isopropyl alcohol will dissolve the dirt that gets in the mouse. The second thing I do is to rub the rollers inside with sandpaper. The rollers have a tendency to get smooth and that combined with the smoothness of the trackball makes this mouse prone to being affected by dirt. The sandpaper solution is very effective."
1,Poor Design,The major problem with the design of this mouse is that you operate the buttons with your thumb and the ball with your fingers. The track ball just doesn't track very well either. It seems to get stuck even though I keep it clean.
2,Gets dirty too easily.,"I have been using this trackball for about a year. Because your fingers touch the ball, it gets much oilier and dirtier than a regular mouse where the ball only touches the mouse pad which doesn't have skin oils. The trackball builds up dirt too easily and the dirt then sticks to the rollers inside the unit and then it doesn't track. A a delicate cleaning and tedious cleaning is then required. It's annoying. I would get an optical trackball instead. Worth the extra money."
4,Most reliable,"Relative to other trackballs, this one is lacking in overall features, but it does have the basics and a wheel. In addition, it is aestheticly disapointing. However, I have tried Logitech and Kensington, and both those brands always give my system problems with vavious driver conflicts and other things. I have never been able to get Logitech devices to work on my system, and Kensington devices always caused routine errors. Thus, I went with this trackball and have operated trouble free ever since. I gave this device 4 stars because of it reliability, but I hope MS does a redesign soon."
2,High Maintenenct,The problem with this device is that the ball is very smooth and will slip if it gets the least little bit of grease on it from a skin cream or even eating a potato chip. I use the mouse all day and had to switch to a trackball to avoid repetition injury. The only other mouse I've used is Logitech which is an optical mouse and requires no reqular cleaning. I'd definitely not buy Microsoft if you're a heavy user.
2,"wonderful voice, musical arrangement needs lots of help","When I first heard this woman's voice, I was amazed that she was not more popular and that I had not heard of her sooner. After getting the album, I understood. She has a wondeful voice, as good as the best... which is why I don't understand why all the rest of the sound (I'm no musical expert) is not up to her level. Perhaps she just enjoys keeping things sane and small, because with the right support, I suspect she would be on par with Celine Dion and Diana Ross. But on this album, its disappointing."
4,Great book wish there were more in production,I remember reading this as a youth and tried to find the book with the same cover and all. So glad I was able to find a piece of my memory. Cynthia Voigt was a terrific writer.
4,a kingdom book,"I read the first three books set in this 'world' of cynthia voigt's, though while the 'kingdom' is mentioned none of the other books are set in it. I enjoyed each book thoroughly and found little to have qualms over with Elske.the beginning of the book is dark, but getting beyond that is what makes it worthwhile. here's a girl who's future had been planned (namely death) who now has a chance to be something else. unlike other stories where the young girl survives something horrific and comes back to meet justice to the evil-doers forcibly Elske builds a life a for herself. by being herself and being true to people she becomes the confidant to young beriel.beriel who IS on a mission to deal out justice to those who did her wrong. the two become close, sharing a common link to their pasts and learn how to survive in the world.its a novel about what it means to belong and just how important one's heritage can be (or not be), at least to me."
2,Beware of mature subject matter,"13-year-old Elske escapes rape and certain death at the hands of the leaders of her barbaric [Volkaric] society. She leaves her homeland and, through several contacts, finally becomes handmaiden to Beriel. Together they work to claim Beriel's rightful throne in the kingdom.This book should be for mature readers only. The Volkaric society is barbaric in that there is mention that men rape women in multiples, babies are given to wolves, etc. This thread goes through the book, not in a sickening way, but being descriptive of the society. Later, there is mention of a woman's bleeding time and the description of the birth process."
1,"Depressing, disgusting book. Big disappointment from Voigt.","I agree with L. Johnson. This book is totally inappropriate for young girls. If you are a concerned parent reading this do not let your children read it. Let them keep their childhood a little longer. Even though I am nineteen this book, starting out with ritual rape and baby sacrifices, left a bad taste in my mouth. I do not feel we need to dwell on such negative aspects of human behavior. I felt that the writing was also poor. The Elske character was flat and not well developed. I also read The Wings of a Falcon and was disappointed with it too. This whole series is a bust. After reading the wonderful Dicey's Song and Homecoming I was very disappointed."
2,Not sure if this book is fantasy or historical fiction...,"I guess I would have to call it ""historical fantasy."" When I read the book, I was unaware that is was part of a larger series, or for that matter if any of the cultures portrayed were parts of actual ancient cultures. That said, Elske is the story of a young girl who escapes the ""Wolfers"", a barbaric band of people. She eventually ends up in Trastad, where she makes contact with a women rumored to be a queen, Beriel. I disliked Beriel, and felt that after Elske met her, that the book went downhill. I also wondered why the painting shown on the front of the book was chosen, for it is the same painting used for ""Girl in a Pearl Earring"", a much better work."
1,With the wild images of ritual gang-rape & subsequent death,"...ringing in my imagination, I left Voigt's novel after the second chapter. It's not as though I feel I'm prudish about topics dealing with issues young adults face. I loved Laurie Halse-Anderson's, Speak. Elske, however, disturbed me because I felt as though I were reading an illicit child-pornography tract. Instead of a thought-provoking examination of the exploitation girls may encounter, society's response to it and the ultimate successful resolution of that girl finding her voice and becoming healthy and whole, Voigt treated us to Elske's grandmother getting gang-raped to death in her stead so that she may run away... to what? Having left that horrendous experience in the first pages, life didn't seem worth much point."
5,The review of Elske,"This book tells of a girl with great courage. Elske escapes a savage death and goes to start a new life in Trastad. Here she discovers her inner self, but only when she puts her trust in the princess she is to serve.This book is about medieavel times, different traditions and difficult times.This is an excellent read"
2,Ditto - Underwhelming,"I agree with comments here, so I'll make mine brief. If you are going to buy a telescope for a beginner, do NOT buy this one. I should have taken this back for a reflective telescope, but it was a gift to my daughter (not from me). Ease of use and brilliance of object is everything to a young astronomer. Get something recommended for surfing the planets. Don't trust the pictures on the box, or buy it for the gadgets. Also, light collection is more important than magnification."
5,Great Product,"This is a great headset. I was looking for one that was comfortable to someone who wears glasses and had top quality in sound and microphone performance for games. This headset fit the bill. Only downside to using it is if not plugged in when starting a program/game you have to exit that program/game, plug it in (USB) then restart the program/game. Works great with Ventrillo and Teamspeak."
3,Great when it was working,I bought this headset to play World of Warcraft and oh what an improvement over my separate headphones and mic. The sound was suprisingly good and I got no complaints when I spoke. I actually came out very clear. I had an issue in XP when I switched between the headset and my speakers where there would be no sound but when I switched to a Vista machine I had no problems. I had it for a couple of months then there was no sound coming out of one side. I probably could have used the warranty but I didn't really care since I stopped playing WoW and don't use the headset anymore. It was probably my fault anyhow being rough and careless with it. If you are like me and tend to pull the wires a lot by accident go find a wireless one.
4,"Good Headset, but. . .","I ordered the headset from Techdepot (Office Depot) through Amazon. The headset was available at www.techdepot.com or through Amazon.com. Ordering through Amazon was cheaper, even though it actually came from Techdepot.The headset sound is good, and my friends tell me the mic works well.The headset is a USB headset. I had not used a USB headset before and had not considered that when I plug in the headset it would alter the settings on my PC. Unlike a ""normal"" headset with a mic in and audio out jack, when you plug in or unplug a USB headset, you may find that you have to change the settings in your audio properties or have to start or restart your program before the headset will work. This is a bit of an annoiance. Except for this issue, the headset works great and sounds great. Just consider that you need to plug it in before you start your game or communication program."
5,Best headset in the world.,I've tried a dozen headsets from the best manufacturers. None of them are comfortable in the long run and few of them sound as good as my GameCom Pro 1 did. I miss this headset. Please make more.
5,Works great,"I use this for Skype-out, telemedicine research and music... and this product works very well for all three. It's comfortable (even with glasses), and I've worn it for hours without even noticing them. Sound quality (both the mic and the earphones) are very good."
5,Same as the DSP-500's that are on clearance,These headsets are great with 5.1 sound quality and minimal microphone feedback but they cost $61 while you can pick up the DSP-500's which are the same exact headsets but with a different paint job for $18 on clearance from the plantronics website in the clearance area.
3,Watch very good.. but date unreadable,"Nice neat watch, accurate, back light nice, but date very hard to see."
5,Do yourself a favor and buy this one,"This book captures adolescence like no book I have ever seen before. Touching and funny, beautiful and harsh, full of vibrant characters who you both love and hate, it is a journey that all of us have gone through. I felt like this had been written decades ago and was shocked to learn that it was just released, which would explain why I can't find anyone to talk to about it. Just do yourself a favor and read this soon to be classic."
5,Written by a significant literary talent to be watched!,"When Tom Quint has a debilitating accident on a snow dusted New York street, he gives in to a desperate longing to live in the past. Quint's obsession becomes so strong that he begins to sever all ties with the present until three of his friends propose a road trip. The four boys travel across America in search of adventure, laughs, and some kind of meaning to the vagaries life. The three buddies try their best to pull Quint out of the shell he has built around him. Even with their own natural zest, humor, and energy, it proves to be no easy task and leads to an engaging and somewhat surprising climax. The Letter is Joseph Devon's debut novel and marks him as a significant literary talent to be watched for in the future!"
3,not as fun as the first three,"If you're reading a review for Disc 4 of ""His and Her Circumstances,"" you've probably already purchased the first three discs, and will probably buy Discs 4 and 5 anyway. Please, go ahead! I did, and Disc 5 as well.However, it must be said that the episodes on the fourth disc are not as good as those on the first three discs. The vivacious wit that marked the previous episodes is in much shorter supply here. This is not to say that this disc is unenjoyable. If you liked the previous installments, you'll probably enjoy these too, but these episodes simply are not as winning.The quality of the technical details, however, is somewhat better. The layout of the menus and such are the same as before, but the quality control problems that plagued the first printings of Disc One seem to be gone. I played the disc completely through, and didn't have any problems."
2,some minuses,"a little bit weak, uninteresting at times, the plot makes you expect the worst. it's not all that bad actually. a scientist creates a very powerful weapon. and he told someone he shouldn't. so now someone takes action. at the same time the scientist gets involved with a woman. bad timing. the nasty russians are ready. you can read this novel. but don't expect more than mediocrecy."
1,"Very poor audio and video,Poor presentation and documentatio",This video has extremely poor quality. The audio and video is not clear. There is tremendous redundency and lack of focus on the full details of this historical era. The presentation is fragmented and incohesive. It is by far one of the worse documentaries that I have ever seen.
4,"Fantastic, except......","Look, the pictures just don't do the watch justice. Its sleek, slim and the face is the kind of color you love looking at. But, i must say that the band is a bit of a letdown. Sizing can be done by a normal person with no tools but its a HUGE pain. Also, the clasp keeps undoing itself, it seems.....cheap. Don't get me wrong, I have had mine for a few months and i wear it more often than my TAG or Fossil, so if you don't mind some ""manageable"" issues, its great."
2,Hard crystal?????????,Skagen advertises this watch with a super hard crystal. I now have two of these watches with cracked faces. I bought the second watch because they are beautiful.Well its true- beauty is only skin deep.I definitely will not buy Skagen again.I went to Tissot and Seiko Titanium.Buy quality.Keith
2,Mantis Honda Tiller Review,"I live at 6500 feet. The tiller is underpowered and apparently needs a carb kit that is for high altitude that no one out in my area knows how to do -- even the dealers. The tiller tines freeze every time they catch a 4"" rock. I'm sure it is fine for small gardens with no rocks at low altitudes, but it is barely useful at 6500 feet with periodic rocks. I'm always stopping the thing to pry out rocks that get stuck between the tines and the tine cover. Any tall weed will also wrap around the tines and I need to stop it to dig them out. Won't cut them or till them in. Would probably buy a more conventional tiller next time."
3,Arrived Broken..No Return,"Product arrived with transmission locked up. No Return but was able to get replacement transmission from Mantis.Too bad to have to repair a ""New"" item. Works OK but not well in my rocky soil i.e. bounces around a lot."
5,A great little machine.,The tiller is a real work horse. I have used it in the yard to prepare the ground for planting and it is super. It has made garden work much easier and faster.
4,"Quieter, less fumes, no need to mix oil/gas","Overall, I love this tiller. Compared to the 2 cycle engine, it seems to be much quieter, and the emissions are less. (Direct comparison in the dealership, in addition to what I read). I have other 4 cycle machines that take regular gas, so the convenience of just adding gas is nice. If you have a lot of 2 cycle machines that all use the same oil/gas ratio, and you keep a can filled with that, than you will probably be happier with the 2 cycyle Mantis (it's significantly less $)As far as its function, it turns over a 12x4 raised bed for the garden in a few minutes easily, much nicer than doing it by hand like I used too! I can get all my beds ready for spring planting in less than an hour. It is not powerful enough to till established sod or thick vegetation, so if you are looking to start a new bed, consider renting a BIG monster tiller for the task, or using the lasagna gardening technique."
1,Do Not Buy This Machine,"Bought one of these 4 years ago. Have had a problem from day one. Oil spewed from the spark arrestor. Covered under warranty. This year ran Ok but there has been a gradual loss of power over the past three years. After running it for about 1 hour this year I could not start the engine. Brought it in for service. Needed a new carburetor (only about 35 hours on the engine). Still had problems- replaced pistons and head gasket. $300 in repairs, started right up and ran about 5 minutes, then would stall out when I tried to start tilling.Repair company has no idea what else is wrong. Called Mantis who said to call Honda - talk about passing the buck. The number they gave me for Honda was not working.I have had used Mantis tillers for 25 years. But my run with them is finished!"
4,Tiller review,Was happy with the ease of assembly and clear insructions. Engine started fairly easily and is quiet. I had used an old Mantis before and the new 4 stroke Honda is a nice improvement. Works very well on good garden soil. It doesn't have the power or weight to take on rocky soil or too many tough roots. Overall a good product and a labor saver for my modest garden.
3,Bricks of Eygpt boring - now bricks of Atlantis much better.,"I tried games prior to this purchase and figured for the price I would purchase this here as it was so much cheaper - anyways, the graphics, game etc., is boring! Bricks of Atlantis is so much more fun and the graphics are way better (water) - if I would have it my way I would never have purchased this Bricks of Egypt game...even my 6 year old says it is boring."
3,The menfolk of the family review,"I bought this game for my husband and son . While they did enjoy it for a little while, they both describe it as ""juvenile"", possibly better for the younger crowd. Although they no longer play the game, we will keep it around for our grandsons to play when they come to visit."
3,not for me....,"i bought this cd on the strength of the reviews posted here. the songs do very little for me, but i confess not being a big fan of acoustic rock in general, and definitely not of the dave matthews variety, which this band owes a very obvious debt. in addition, the lyrics are painfully trite (sample lyric: ""i speak for the meek/the meek are not weak/the truth is what they seek/ listen to the words i speak"") and the singer tries a bit too hard. it's well-played and certainly has a groove, but i did not get what i was hoping for."
2,Raunchy!,"Bought this for my father who was in the hospital. Thought it was trucker humor, he said he turned it off within seconds because of the dirty language. Poor Dad!"
3,"Maybe it's just me, but ...","I thought I would have use for a telephoto. The price was right so I ordered this one. In all, it is fine. The tunnel effect was unexpectedly pronounced.As indicated in a review above, an adapter is required. It is an extra $30. I would have hoped that when ordering the lens that notification of the need to get the adapter would be provided.I thought I had bought the wrong adaptor when I was unable to screw the adaptor onto the lens. I finally checked the Kodak FAQ and found that you need to remove the outer ring on the lens (it has a silver color band) to access the threads for the adapter. This is merely a ring not a protective lens. I guess it protects the threads."
5,Successful Gift,My brother was delighted with his lens and you got it here before Christmas which made me very happy.
1,Waste,"Not what I expected. Kodak recommens this lens for it's Z740. It creates a ""pipe"" effect in the shot until you zoom out almost 1/2 the focal length. Really is not a good item and a waste of money."
5,Review for lens,I received the lens in a timely manner and am very pleased with it. Thanks for the provider.
3,It looks great but how does it work???,I got this lens after reading tons of reviews. I've looked in the Kodak manual & been all over the net. I can't find anything to tell me how to make it work w/ the Z7590. It doesn't seem to do anything. I know it well because of all the images I've seen but does anyone know how to make it work? I can't find any settings in the menu to turn on the zoom. This lens & a new Mac laptop will have me in a looney bin soon!
2,Feels sorta cheap to me...,"I really dislike this mouse. It's made out of a hard plastic and doesn't move across the mouse pad easily. The wheel couldn't of been designed any worse. It feels very cheap, and when you try to scroll with it it starts to zoom, because it jams up inside the buttons. I was expecting a little better from this Microsoft product. I would advise against buying this mouse, and buy an optical one. I guess you have to pay a little more to get more."
2,Quality control is not good,"I recently got a new computer at work that had the OEM version of the Intellimouse. I liked it so much that I bought one for home. Unfortunately, the one that arrived is close to unusable. The whole reason for buying it was that once I got used to the scroll wheel feature, I loved it. This mouse, however has a wheel that gets very slippery and the switch under the wheel is extremely sensitive. You have to bear down on the wheel to keep it from slipping but that causes the switch to activate. My mouse at work has neither problem. The wheel does not slip and you must give it a definite push to activate the switch.Clearly, Microsoft does not have good manufacturing process controls. This one was made in Mexico by TEAM SCLA....By the way, another reviewer complained about the scrolling feature moving too much or too little. That is configurable on the control panel."
2,Information to add to my earlier review,"I wrote an earlier review critical of this mouse. I found out from Microsoft that the OEM version sold by Dell is NOT made by Microsoft and might be slightly different, though it is made to Microsoft specs. That may explain why I really liked the Dell version and I do not like the Microsoft version. I recommend the Dell, though I didn't see it offered on their web site for separate sale.Also, the Dell software has a few minor added features than does Microsoft's. (e.g. Hit the ctrl button and it highlights your cursor.)"
1,This mouse is AWFUL,One reason I bought this mouse was for the scroll feature. And guess what? It never worked. Instead the mouse software wacked out my computer.
2,Find out where it is made first!,"Same experience as previous reviewer... I have an intellimouse at work that I liked, so I bought one online. The new one's middle button was so sensitive that it was impossible to use the scroll wheel without triggering the button. This is horrible in UNIX, where the middle button is mapped to paste, so you get <scroll> <paste> <scroll> <paste> ... It messes things up in a hurry :)Anyway, the (good) one at work has a dull finish and is made in China. The new (faulty) one has a shiny finish and is made in Mexico. I even returned the new one and got one at a local store, with the same results. It is also a shiny finish and made in Mexico."
2,Made in Mexico - la rueda no jira,"The wheel on my ""Made in Mexico"" mouse stopped working after a couple months. The wheel can no longer be turned, and the push down funciton on the wheel is too sensitive. If it hadn't broken down on me, I would have liked it. Thanks again Microsoft for another product that DOES NOT work like it's supposed to."
1,DO NOT BUY!!!,"I bought this Microsoft Intellimouse thinking it was going to work great. Boy was I WRONG! The Intellimouse software [messed] up my laptop and made internal errors. Everytime you restarted you would have to do it again because there was another error. The mouse was also messed up. It would move at extremely high speeds and open up everything it touched without me even clicking on it. The right and left click buttons both did the same thing. I originally had Win 98 on my lap, but I had to install Windows 2000 Pro just to get it fixed. I am lucky that even worked. Do not buy this mouse. Microsoft is USUALLY dependable but this time their product is defective. One more thing, the price is not that good either.Instead buy an optical or wireless mouse."
2,genrious customer service,"The box is original made in USA design. When I purchased the tire plug,it was made in Taiwan and had a different design. I call customer service and they could not find the made in USA king. I find the Taiwan broke off easy and don't go in the tire smooth. I wanted to return the product and the company was nice enought to give it to me at no charge. It takes about three weeks to get the credit money. Its a good thing I bought from a known internet dealer. Thanks Amazon."
1,DO NOT BUY!!!,"Ordered 5 boxes of this item. I received 5 sets of 5 strings, not the 5 boxes. I returned them to get a replacement. Received 1 set of 5 strings with the number (5) and the part number written on the outer plastic cover. Called Amazon customer service. Was told that they would send a call tag to return this screwed up order and send the original order of 5 boxes of 60 strings by the end of August. Received an E-Mail stating that I received a refund of $5.08 for the original order of $25.40. PISS POUR SERVICE AND PRODUCTS. Going to go thru VISA and cancel the order due to lack of product for over 3 weeks!"
5,Hall of Justus taking over rap????,"For those of you who dont know who any of these artists are in the Hall of Justus, u need to adjust the volume, cause like the title states, it sounds like HOJ is taking the rap game over. From the acclaimed trio of Little Brother, to L.E.G.A.C.Y., to Chaundon, to Joe Scudda, to their newest member Jozeemo, all these artists are straight lyricists. And on the production side of things, u got the infamous 9th Wonder and the ""soon to be known as one of the best producers in the game"", Khrysis. There are some really insane tracks on this cd and only maybe 1 or 2 throw-away tracks. So with 19 tracks on this cd, it shouldnt even be question on whether or not to buy this cd, cop it and drop it."
1,Bad Customer service,"For one, I didn't receive this product at ALL!! I purchased this product online with my debit card in good faith. What should be done to remedy this situation?"
1,Bottle will shatter in shipping.,"I had a subscription to this product. The first time it arrived properly packed, but then twice in a row the bottles, which are glass, arrived completely pulverized. They had just been thrown in with a couple of those packing-pillows, which were punctured by the broken glass. I cut myself, of course. Amazon gave me a refund both times and then I canceled the subscription.The vitamins themselves are fine-- they will not cause digestive upsets you get from unbuffered Vitamin C. But having them shipped by amazon won't work."
2,A good try...,"'Beyond Vanilla' does very little to 'debunk' the misconceptions the general public has about the lifestyle, and gives very little information that anyone who is in the lifestyle for more than a year probably doesn't already know. As such, it does little to satisfy either side of the equation.Another problem is probably 75% of the content is focused on gay male activities. While that is fine for gay males, it leaves out a very large part of participants in the lifestyle. The one straight male Dom that is interviewed feels as someone chosen primarily on his looks, as opposed to any great skill or knowledge, as evidenced by his calling the falls of a flogger 'bristles'. Even my friends who have participated in the lifestyle for only a few months laughed at that statement.Overall, it's a good try, but doesn't do justice to the people, diversity, or breadth of the lifestyle."
1,Horrible ghosting/shadowing on the display,"I had this delivered with an Amazon Fresh order to extend the connection between my desktop and monitor. I hooked it up and experienced shadow/ghosted video. I tried moving the cable around, avoiding other cables, etc. but noting improved the display. The ghosting is so bad that it gives me a headache to read text on the screen for several minutes. Judging by other reviews, it must be hit and miss on the quality for these cables. If I could rate this a zero, I would have. This will be going in the garbage."
4,Nice Cable,"Nice cable and for the price it's ok, i have only try it once and it works perfect. The only things i dislike is the color tone, in the picture it looks more white, but now i see that is like gray, i use it with the VGA adapter for my ipad and it looks bad because the ipad adapter is really white."
2,Blurry picture but works,The cable works and was easy to install. The connectors fit properly and the cable is long enough for most uses. The picture is somewhat blurry and has very bad ghosting. The cable probably is not well shielded. I would recommend to purchase another product with better shielding.
1,Avoid!,"When using this cable, the image on the screen is so fuzzy as to be unusable for anything but watching instant-view (low-res) NetFlix movies from several feet away. For normal computer use, it'll give you a headache after just a few minute's use. I would not recommend this cable to a friend."
5,DR. CAPEHART,"I SAW HER ON TBN, AND YOUTUBE, I LISTENED TO THE ALBUM CLIPS AND LOVED IT I LOVE EVERY LAST SONG, "" I AM ENCOURAGED"" WILL CARRY YOU"" FORGIVE THEM"" ""GOT TO BE REAL""I CAN"""
3,Folded leaflet is ok,"All the projects are shown as on the cover. I have dozens of cross stitch books and magazines and can find other flowers I'd do before these. However, if any of these strike you, it's worthwhile. Just don't pay a lot."
5,A Must,Its a MUST if you wanna know more about the music of Al Di Meola although its kinda bored to some people.
4,Incredibly dense - Worth the effort.,"This book is not for the uninitiated. It certainly is no course for beginning guitarists, as most would find it unfulfilling and incomprehensible. However, if you are a veteran guitarist who wishes to vastly increase his/her chord and scale vocabularies, then this book is perfect. It is really nothing more than a chord dictionary, with two added features. The first is that the chords are arranged in terms of complimenting one another. Thus you learn chord relations, and not just chords. Secondly, the scale section is organized similarly; after learning a series of chord relations, the student then moves on to learn the relevant scales. Once again, it is an incredible book, but not one for someone who just wants to add a few more chops to his/her vocabulary."
3,Grade B Prime,"In her second installment in her Primes series, Jo Elliot is a woman tryingto hidefrom a painful event in her past, and Marcus Cage is a man, who is trying tohidefrom those who seek to do him harm.Cage kidnaps Jo not only because he needs her, but because he was led to hersheis his sanity and that is what he needs most at this point in his life.Cage nevertells Jo that he's a vampire, he won't bring her into that part of his lifeyet becauseshe'd be in too much danger, so he does the only honorable thing he canthink of, helets her go because she's making his survival instincts fall by the wayside.Whenshe is around his only goal is her happiness.Only by letting her go does he end up putting her in even more danger, as he left her empathic gifts numb so she doesn't know to trust.Some of the plot points were kind of like man why give it away, but otherthan thatit was a good continuation in this cross between Feehan and Hamilton."
2,Super Reader,"Another book of the largely lacking in plot variety. A Prime Vampire is the head tough male macho dude of a vampire clan. The one here is a bit stuck, and finds himself a woman because he needs blood.He finds out she is psyhically resonant of sorts, so ensues some bloodsucking, and lots of dream s*x and the 'you bastich you captured me but you are hot take me now' sort of relationship.In the second half, something actually happens. She starts to learn what is going on, gets away from him and into the hands of a vampire hunting group, including a human member of the one of the vampire clans that now has a bit of a grudge."
2,I really wanted to like this book.....,"But I just couldn't like either one of the main characters. I loved the concept, it should have been a great story but the dialogue was lackluster and each of their encounters generated no sizzle for me. They had no discernible chemistry that I could see. The female just gets herded along without asking any questions about what he wants with her. Then she betrays him? He might have understood but I sure didn't!! Maybe the next one will be more interesting."
5,Great new series,"Yes there are very strong resemblences to Christine Feehan, but only in the best way and not at all derivitive. Sizemore is a very good writer who's in top form with this series. The prose is snappy, the story interesting, and the world-building fascinating. This is a don't miss for any fan of paranormal romance"
5,"I loved it! Gritty, sophisticated vampire romance! Wonderful","I loved this book! Marcus was a fantastic vampire hero, and the heroine Josephine was just as excellent. It's a gritty, sexy, earthy vampire romance. I loved it!"
5,2nd Read was even better than the First,"This is one of the best vampire series since Christine Feehans Dark Series. It is simply awesome. I just wanted to glance over this story to refresh my memory to prepare myself for her next book, I HUNGER FOR YOU, instead I ended up re-reading it a second time. It is even better than the first read because now, I notice even more detail that I may have missed the first go around. Sizemore writes brooding and dark vamps with feisty heroines. However, she also interjects a little humour here & there which is really fun. She's also created an ancient vamp society which I really love.If you love vampire romances with alpha heroes and tough heroines as much as I do, then you are going to love Susan Sizemore's vamp series. I highly highly recommend it."
1,I just couldn't get into this one,"I am easily pleased with romance books of any kind, but I just could not get into this one. In fact I didn't even finish it.It just seemed that it did not go into any depth of exploring the characters, their feelings, or anything else for that matter. Even the parts of the book that I thought were finally beginning to explore the characters left me very disappointed. At one point, I said out loud, ""That's it?""This book was a huge let down for me."
4,I Thirst for You,"This is the second book in the Prime Series, of which I have read the first three. This one gives you a look into the Families, while the other two give you Clan vampires.I really liked the action in this book. The story was pretty good, although the heroine is a bit week for my tastes.Susan Sizemore's books are good at building an enjoyable and believable world for her characters."
4,Organic andTaste Great!,I have had these before but found the best price on Amazon. I would have given 5 stars except for the fact that some cones are broken but most times I usually can use these anyway.
1,"tastless, always broken",I have bought this brand several times and it's one of the worst cones I have tasted. It's tasteless and always broken. I normally eat everything organic but on this occasion I have to say there are some natural verities that have no hydrogenated oils that I rather buy.
1,not tasty and low quality,"a. These cones are consistently broken upon purchase, regardless of whether it is online or in a B&M; storeb. They are not tasty and stale quickly compared to other brandsc. You can use any force while putting ice cream into these cones. They will break under the pressure."
3,Organic Ice Cream Cones,"This item was listed in the gleuten free section but it is not. I did get a complete refund from Amazon, but was disappointed that I could not eat them. I guess this is what happens when you try to do things in a hurry and don't read every single word about a product, and rely on the search to bring up accurate data."
3,not as tasty as Joy brand and black stuff growing on them,I have no idea what was growing on them but it was black.
5,Ali's Mommy,I love this sack. And highly recommend it especially if your child likes to kick the blankets up over their heads. Before I purchased this I found her sleeping with the coveres over her head twice!!!!
5,Wish I Had Invented This!,"How many times a night do you go into your baby's room to make sure the covers are still on them? Yeah, well, you can stop doing that now. Just buy this. The sack zips in the opposite direction so as not to catch on baby's skin. I must have washed this thing a trillion times and it held up wonderfully. Just put your baby in his/her pajamas and zip them up in the Halo Sleep Sack. It doesn't look like much but it certainly keeps them warm! I must have pointed and laughed at my daughter for a good five minutes when I put her in this for the first time. It looks pretty comical on, but in a cute way. She also had plenty of room to move her legs and feet around . . . kind of like a mini sleeping bag that stays put. I highly recommend this and it makes an excellent baby shower gift."
1,Stinky Sleep Sack,"When the sleep sack arrived, it smelled strongly of moth balls. After two washes, the smell was still so strong that I was not willing to put the sack on my baby. I returned the item & ordered another color, hoping that the weird smell was a fluke. It was not a fluke. The replacement sack smelled just as badly as the first one. Though I typically love Amazon & order from them on pretty much a weekly basis, I cannot recommend buying this product from Amazon. Unfortunately, I'll be making a trip to another store to purchase this item in the future rather than enjoying the convenience of ordering from Amazon."
5,"Great quality, soft and durable",We have been using the HALO SleepSack Wearable Blankets since our first child and cannot say better things about them.This particular one is a fleece version that was a wonderful Pink hue and a true Medium fit for our 6-12 month old child. The item gets washed every other day and is still in great condition after dozens of washes and has not shown any fade. A+
3,Good product,I returned the sleep sack because I misjudged the size I needed. The medium was much larger than I thought it would be. The quality was good. I just decided I needed a small.
3,"Good quality, But sizing runs small.",Order up a size if you want this to fit properly. I had to hand mine down to my girlfriend without ever getting to wear it. Nice shirt though.
3,Casting is the only flaw to sink this naval carrier,"Kevin McCarthy was the best known intellectual of the fifties. His long brooding face filled the screen with what made us think of the word ""egghead"" first- a doctor, lawyer or scientist. He's very badly miscast as a navy pilot and a football player. John Derek, on the other hand, is a shoe in for the part of his younger brother and romantic rival for the same girl. With better casting luck his bold action persona sporting a sensitive side could have been the Tom Cruise of the fifties. The battle scenes are top notch, intercutting real planes aboard a naval carrier with close shots of our stars. One weak scene does show them looking out the window from their planes in flight at each other about ten feet apart, not an A+ for realism, there."
4,nice w/ good oil control,"fast shipment.Had good skin but after a month, still getting pimples. I might repurchase it again.Pores got a little less noticeable. Prefer the vitamin soap than the anti-bacterial one."
4,Great toning tape..,I enjoyed this tape.. I have used it once and will definetly be using it again.. After finishing the tape. my thighs were so sore for 2 days.. very good work out.. learned some new exercises that I havent done before..I will be using this one often.. I would recommend this video to anyone..
2,Not a walking workout,"WEll I was very disappointed when I got this. There is no walking involved at all. It is just a bunch of toning exercises. I am not sure when it was filmed, but the workoutwear is very early 90's ish and Leslie talks about just having her son recently. Don't buy this if you are wanting a walking workout because there is no walking in it like the other workouts."
2,Get out your 90's workout Gear,"I love Leslie and feel I owe my current hot bod to her Walk Away the Mile DVD's...1, 2 and 3 miles. But this one I feel a little duped. It is very outdated and must have been done in the early 90's. However the packaging says something like 2004...."
4,"Is this another edition of Steiner's ""Cosmic Memory""?","Many hands published Steiner's works in the period approximately 1950-1980. Does anyone know for sure if this is Cosmic Memory re-titled or unique material?If this IS another edition of Cosmic Memory, that would be five stars for content, zero stars for confusing this edition with other editions under the more common title."
5,Surprisingly good,"As a Bruce Lee fan, I've seen not only all ofnhis movies but those of the many Bruce imitators. Bruce Li is hands down the best. But beyond the Bruceploitation, Bruce Li had the charisma and acting ability to hold his own which is why he became such a star in his own right. Exit The Dragon is jam packed with everything that made Bruce Li great.The only thing that kind of made the movie a little less enjoyable for some reason was that they filmed a few external shot of Betty Ting Pei's actual apartment at the time where Bruce died. That was kind of a buzzkill, but obviously it was the director or producer who decided to film there, not Bruce Li's fault."
4,Great Product!,"These are my first tampons, and I have to say they did a good job. I was nervous at first...being used to seeing the bulky regular sized tampons. But when I used these I realized how easy it was. When I wore pads at school, i had to change them every two periods (45 minute periods), but now I only have to change at lunch. The is one con to this product, though, there is some discomfort when I remove them. And I know that is how it is with every tampon since I have a light flow and they don't make light tampons, but the pain wasn't bad enough to make me stop using them. I highly reccomend them to first timers!"
5,It got me through Econometrics,"This was an extremely useful book for the understanding of Statistics and Econometrics. Each topic had examples to show how the formulas work. The computer chapter went over the programming in SAS, Excel, and Eviews for the problems in the book. Best of all, the problems had answers. This is a must-have for beginning statistics and econometrics since it starts from scratch, and for theory students in search of an application."
4,Good book,It is a very good book. It starts very basic but it goes deeper into econometrics after some chapters.Very easy to understand... I would totally recommended!
5,A valuable book,"Walter Diamond, with Dorothy Diamond editing, wrote a captivating book that transports the reader along with the Diamonds as they meet with government dignitaries and others in countries all around the world. Mr. Diamond's early career in unraveling World War II espionage is as intriguing as a well-written novel, and one learns the traits and charactistics of competent versus less than competent government leaders.J. Richard DukeDuke Law Firm, P.C.400 Vestavia Parkway, Suite 100Birmingham, Alabama 35216"
4,Good but not great,"I read many reviews calling this the best book ever and had to check it out for myself. Although King Dork is as laugh-out-loud funny as most people say it is, It did not totally live up to my expectations. There really isn't much of a plot and most of the qustions/mysteries involved in the story are left unresolved or resolved in an unbelievable way. I thought the ending of the book starting with everything after the ""Festival"" was somewhat lacking and not very believable and I wish there had been more time spent on explaining the motivations of the characters. I will say that the characters are some of the most memorable in any book I have read and I think it would be great if maybe this book were the first in a series. With a couple years left in HS, I'm sure many more stories could be told about Tom and Sam and their adventures in high school life."
4,If you like Freaks and Geeks...,"A whimsical murder mystery wrapped up in a music-obsessed episode of Freaks and Geeks. Engaging, clever, and often very funny. You don't have to be part of the teen/young adult audience to enjoy it, either. (I'm 31). 4.25/5."
3,I wanted to love it,"This book has gotten so many accolades and high praise from an amazing array of sources. I expected great things from it, and in some ways, it does deliver. But I have to admit, I found the main character a little too smart, filled with too much attitude, too aware of adult things to be believable or someone with whom I could relate for three hundred pages. There is a lot of funny stuff and great moments, but I guess I wanted to care more about the character."
4,Lots of fun to read...,"....if you enjoy numerous semi-obscure pop culture references by a 14 year old main character, who, imo, thinks more like a 20-something than a high school underclassman.Could have been a few pages shorter, as the band and first album naming thing was very funny in the beginning, but got a bit strained. I did thoroughly enjoy ""King Dork"", which is the first book by Frank Portman, and would recommend it to just about anyone except ""normal/psychotic"" folks. You know who you are."
1,Complete bore!,"awful, awful - and just completely boring! My daughter and I listened to 6 of the 11 discs on tape during a road trip. The main character was rarely funny and completely tedious. Not recommended-don't waste your time or dime."
3,more Catcher than not,"This is the story of what Holden Caulfield would have been like if he hadn't been kicked out out of school, and had gone to public school in California. Despite his protestations about how much he doesn't get the whole Catcher in the Rye thing, Tom is made very much in Holden's image. Tom has a few things going for him over Holden, though. He is willing to interact with some parts of society, and gives more people than just his younger sister the benefit of the doubt, all of which make him a much more tolerable narrator. The other big difference between this book and Catcher is that in this book there's an actual plot. Said plot ranges all over the place, and includes excessive foreshadowing, but at least it's there."
3,fizzles....,"I did really enjoy this book for about the first third, even half,of the story. But then, a funny thing happened...I stopped caring. I got sick of our hero. I found his comments becoming repetitious. I guess the author deserves credit for allowing his voice to become annoying. I actually think this book is a bit flipped...I think it's too ""normal"" for me. ""Nerdy"" outcast likes girl,has social issues, has family quarrels, etc.etc. Kind of typical, frankly. Still, he's a good writer and this book isn't bad...just not as good as its cracked up to be."
4,Book for class.,Bought this book for a class I'm taking. Love Catcher in the Rye so I'm excited to read this book.
2,"Holden, you got nothing to worry about","A previous reviewer writes: ""The writer is extremely clever, and has a way with words."" I agree. Unfortunately, he doesn't have a way with the kind of words a 14 year old would be thinking and speaking. That's the genius of Catcher In The Rye, and why it's still a great book -- and still being read -- 50 years later. Holden talks like a 16 year old. Chi-Mo talks like a senior year Lit major at a small private college somewhere. Trust me on this, King Dork will not be on anyone's reading list 50 years from now. A 14 year old high school sophomore probably wouldn't give a shout out to an obscure Hemingway short story (see if you can find it)."
2,"Just fell apart, such a shame...","This was a sure five star book for the first three quarters, but the jokes just kept repeating, Tom kept repeating himself and saying in 2 pages what could have been said in 2 lines, or not at all.Ok, ok, we get it, the mystery is a tough one, why not go on forever about how it's hard to be sure about what you know or don't know or how it could be speculation, then 10 pages later make the exact same speech.Is this a mystery novel? Not really, unless you think giving us a ton of evidence and theorys and turning them all into hanging plot points a mystery.Why is the step dad is a more major charachter then the sister and mothercombined? because apparently the author really hated the sixties, and the step dad is a hippy.Tom hated catcher in the rye? yeah, he mentions it about a billion times.This book started out so fresh and funny and went absolutley nowhere."
1,King Dork lives up to its title. And not in a good way.,"This is a book for those annoying old people who think that just because they were a teenager years ago, they can write a book about teenagers. King Dork would probably be an okay read if you're thirty or something, I guess, but if you're not, it's a total waste of time."
4,"Drugs, Love, and Isolation","The best parts of Making the Run are its stark, yet evocative prose and the uniqueness of the main character, 18-year old Lu. Lu is not a stereotypical teen ager. Although she has a need to get high to deal with her life (as others her age in this small Kentucky town also do), she views her own life and feelings with honesty. Related from Lu's point of view, the novel's plot is simple, perhaps even predictatble, but it's strength is that it doesn't shy away from the casual drug use and binge drinking, the sex, the impulsive desire to get on with life, and the feelings of apartness that make up the lives of many teen agers. The book is at its best when dealing with her new and powerful attraction to the older Jay and with Lu's sense of being different from the others around her, even her best friend, Ginny. Death, both past and present, plays a powerful role in this young woman's life."
1,a punishing bore,"So fecund, so multi-faceted, and so brimming with scalding tears is the Holocaust that the minute a mediocre movie about it rears its head, it oughta be run out of town.Lifeless characters, mismanaged tension, and a punch-pulling script all help to make ""The Boat is Full"" the most forgettable film I have ever seen about the Holocaust.Strictly for completists."
2,Too Cutsy,I was looking for a much more true approach to this wonderful story of Ruth and Naomi. I was very disappointed.
2,overrated black metal?,"this album is really overrated ... poeple compare this to dimmu borgir and cradle of filth, i don't think so. i must say that there are some good tunes on this album, the first and third. anoter good aspect of this album are the keyboards. they're pretty good actually, very symphonic, lush and dark. but everything else kind've sucks."
4,Intro to Hinduism,"I purchased this as text for a course and it was a pretty good overview. It does not go as in depth as other texts I have read which cover the same material, but it is certainly sufficient for an introduction, especially for those with no previous exposure to Hinduism."
3,Some deception,"The product description indicated no markings: there were no less than 50 pp.that were marked in ink, some quite profusely. Otherwise, the book was in nice shape, nice cover, no turned corners."
3,"Dry, dry, dry","I am not an expert so I cannot comment on the Prof. Flood's scholarship which may be excellent, but I can say that this was one of the most dry, boring books I have ever read. I would suggest that readers try David M. Knipe's Hinduism instead. Its somewhat shorter than Flood, but much more interesting."
1,Old stuff,The archaeologists say that there is no record for invasion/immigration then why should Flood use that as the centre piece of his analytical framework for the development of Hinduism?
3,Textbook,"I enjoyed parts of this text that I had a vague familiarity with, but the remainder was too much to handle."
5,Outstanding overview for non-specialists,"An outstanding overview of the complex history and identities of Hinduism. This would be very useful as a textbook for college-level courses, and will also appeal to non-specialists looking for a scholarly treatment. Excellent discussions of the bhakti traditions and of the remaking of Hinduism by the Hindu Renaissance of the nineteenth century. Probably too advanced for an absolute beginner in religious studies."
5,Perfect charger for an on-the-go camera,We have really enjoyed this charger. After losing our charger (which only plugged into the wall) we love the versatility of this one. The single unit can charge in the car or at home by simply changing the cord. Would purchase again.
3,Battery charger,The cavity for the battery is clearly larger than the original. Maybe it is generic for other batteries. It looks wierd to place the small battery in a larger cavity like the original from Canon. It does work and the price was very good.
1,Stephen Barrett -is- the quack!,"Barrett never never passed the board exams required to be a psychiatrist, yet has claimed to be a psychiatrist for years. What's -that- all about?"
5,An absolute must read,"Barrett just demolishes the quacks here with competent science--chiropractic, homeopathic, naturopathic--all treatments without a shred of scientific evidence to back them up.Look at some of the negative reviews on the page, obviously written by practitioners in these fradulent fields threatened by Barrett's exposure of their scams! They are hilarious!Barrett is a well-respected M.D. who has been a quack watch dog for a long time now, and anyone with any common sense should read this book."
2,Barret's agenda,"This book albeit having interesting information on quackery, which believe me does exist to some form in all professions whether it alternative or mainstream medicine, comes short of nothing more than a way for Dr. Barret to push his agenda.I think that if you want to purchase this book you should also check into the credentials of the author and see his long history of biasness. Do a search on the web under Dr Stephen Barrett and also check into the findings in New Zealand concerning him, and you just might be surprised at what you find."
3,"great feel, problem with arrow and shortcut keys.","This keyboard has fantastic feel to it. I did talk to many people who say that they just cannot get used to it. I am used to it and enjoying it after 5 minutes of use. I don't feel pain in my wrists anymore which is the big plus. However, this keyboard does have couple of immense mistakes in it's design of arrow keys and shortcuts such as ""home"", ""end"", etc. Arrow keys are not alligned in a usual way, they are much more compact as well as shortcut keys which is, for me, A BIG problem. For half an inch of space, this keyboard did lose a lot of points. Also, the keyboard is very high, which means that if you have a desk where the base slides, you are in truble. In all, this product does have an excellent feel as far as typing goes, however, there are many more flaws to it. Honstly I would rather buy Professional version of this keyboard, and pay more monay for it. That is why I give this product grade of three stars minus."
4,it's easy to get over the changes and then it's great!,"I too was thrown off by the placement of the insert key, but as another reviewer said, that only took about a week (OK, so I'm slower than that other guy) to get use to. Other than that, I'm really happy with it. As for the small buttons, that concerned me at first, but I've found it comfortable to use them and I appreciate the small keyboard size that they allow.I hate the fact that many upscale keyboards come with custom buttons (e.g. speaker volume, cd player buttons) that only work easily with Windows. The Natural Pro is guilty of this, but hey, MS makes these things anyhow. At least with the Elite, the only worthless key is the ubiquitous Windows key."
1,Terrible alternate keys,"The keyboard is not bad as a whole, with most keys appropriately sized, and convenient. But the \ key is much too small, and the Windows key and the menu key are very misplaced and almost always cause mistakes. The should be outside the ctrl and alt keys, not interspaced.Additionally, the cursor keys and the alternate keys (home, end, delete, page up, page down, and insert) are easily the worst i've ever seen. They're about as big as tic-tacs and completely out of order. It took me 2 months to stop making mistakes on them. Bad choices all around."
1,Not worth it...,"While the layout is ok, the buttons are too small. And who brilliant thought of rearranging 'Insert', 'Delete', and arrow buttons? I very quickly got sick of always hitting the wrong button. Microsoft should have kept the buttons together in the same place in familiar clusters. The previous version of Natural keyboard was much better, why did they mess with it?"
2,Warning - some keys too small,"I've used the Microsoft Natural Keyboard for years and strongly prefer it over a standard keyboard. When I decided to replace my VERY UNergonomic HP keyboard with a NEW MS Natural Keyboard, the model I ordered was the Elite 2.0.I was very disappoined to find many of the keys (function keys, Home, Page Up/Dn, End, Delete, arrow ...) were half-size keys. My fingers, which are of normal size, kept hitting the adjacent half-size keys, making it highly unproductive to use.While the half-size arrow keys would also not appeal to gamers, I suspect they would also not like the Elite cross-layout of the arrow keys. I've read elsewhere that they prefer the inverted-T layout.I would NOT recommend the Elite model with its pixie-keys to anybody.You have been warned.dickm"
1,Good idea ruined with funky arrow keys,"I use an earlier version of the Microsoft Natural Keyboard at work and that's great. I use a similar keyboard made by a different company at home. I've used this redesigned-to-be-smaller version of the keyboard for about an hour or two, and that's more than enough time to get sick of the re-arranged arrow keys and the undersized insert, delete, etc. keys. If you use the keys between the alphabetic keyboard and the number pad at all, avoid this keyboard."
4,Good knobs.,"They are pretty good knobs for the price, a bit tight on the pots, but that is probably a good thing as they feel solid. They are a bit darker than the picture with more of a copper tint, but they still look great, they only go to 10 however. =)"
2,"Not good, okay ONLY for beginners to Visual C++ 6","The author teaches you minimal basics of using Visual C++ 6. Personally, I found the author hard to follow, and kept flipping back and forth through the book to find the instructions on how to do this and that. But to learn it in ""record time"" is not true, unless you really follow the author's code."
1,"Please, do yourself a favor and look for a different book.","The cover sates that the reader will learn by example. What this means is: ""Do you want to know how to make a window or menu? OK, here is the code.""There is far more code in the book than actual text. The code is almost never explained outside of brief remark statments within the code. If the author had written a book about learning how to build a car engine from scratch, he would have thrown in a bunch of engineer's designs and left it at that.The book also uses MFC and ActiveX controlls heavily without explaining them. The book can't even be used as a reference. This book is a stain upon the autor and Sybex.It dosen't matter what learning style works best for the reader. This book teaches nothing, it mearly shows code. I am experienced with C/C++ as well as a few other languages. Therefore, I do not believe that my dissapointment arises from simply not understanding C++."
2,"Should be called: ""Learn Visual C++ Superficially""","This book pretends to teach Visual C++ by leading you through a serieis of examples. However it seems to be targeting an audience that has little programming experience and in this task it would surely fail. Only an experienced programmer would appreciate the under-pinnings of interrupt pramming and other topics which are never explained in this text. Someone approaching Visual C++ would usually have programming experience and some familiarity with C and C++. If the book had targeted a more experienced audience, the author could have presented the material in a more sucinct style rather than the tedious style that was used."
1,Not a good learning resource,"I was glad to find that I wasnt the only one who found this book very hard to follow. As a CNE/MCSE with Visual Basic experience, I expected this book to do what many others have, teach me something.This book fails miserably in every way."
1,"Takes off, climbs to 5000' then promptly crashes","He started out with a pretty darn good explanation of classes. From there this whole book is a bust. I should have known it was going nowhere the first time he took up 5 pages on a stupid automated source code listing that was generated from the wizard. Once was too much, but he continues to fill hundreds of pages of the book with dozens of redundant wizard source code dumps. Why I don't know. This copied source code isn't even commented on a whole lot by the author. An obvious filler. Reading further and hoping to find more substantial thought, I still only found more BS source listings throughout the rest of the book. Oh well. Go wizard out a typical .exe project, turn around and send your source code to the printer and you'll be bout as far ahead as this book is."
1,Horrible! Look elsewhere for a good book on VC++6,"This book was a joke, it had to be. Skill 1 and 2 were a decent overview of C++ and OOP, but beyond that, the skill lessons were useless.Do yourself a favor and look for a different book, you'll be glad you did.Mine will make a good paperweight until next winter when I can burn it in the fireplace."
5,SOOO JEEVES,"This was the first Bertie and Jeeves' book I'd ever read. If you're interested in British humour, exquisite-snobbish language and witty puns, or in bizarre but classy situations, this is just the book for you. Wodehouse possessed this wonderful characteristic of balancing an unfortunate situation with a good dose of modest humour. The title says it all! Thoroughly recommendable."
4,Terrific,"Another extraordinary comic achievement from the great Wodehouse, this time written in the post-war period. Jeeves and Bertie are stuck in Totleigh Towers again and Spode is on to them. This little gem includes many of Wodehouse's best characters-the Bassetts, Gussie, and of course Stiffy. The prose shines with the same creativity and playfulness as always. Classic Wodehouse."
2,Yikes this is bad! See it just for Mewes,Whoever was shooting with the camera sucked. Must be the directors first movie...and failed. Jason Mewes was pretty good in the movie...and im guessing only his fans will watch it.
2,Not A Great Movie...............,"I don't know what I was expecting here. I love Jason Mewes, and Danny Trejo (Samantha Lockwood is extremely HOT), but this story just misfires. Not horrible, but not great either.............."
2,Disappointing,Not very many good tunes for kids to sing. The Yo Ho song at the end was why we bought this and it's actualy the exact recording from the ride.Having been on the ride probably more than 20 times over 30 years I can say this.
5,It is so much fun!,I have a retail store in San Diego. When playing this CD in my store the customers either dance or sing the lyrics to this CD. I hear it all day long and still enjoy it as my favorite. Well done...
2,Bland,"The selection of songs on this CD was pretty good, but I'm afraid the singers' voices left me flat. There wasn't much depth to most of them. I don't think I'm all that picky when it comes to vocalists...but these were...boring."
2,"Works well for drilling, but breaks under load","This product works well for its basic purpose -- providing a flexible mechanism to drill or drive fasteners around corners or in hard to reach locations. Unfortunately, when only a bit of load is applied (such as when driving a screw or other fastener), the head of the tool breaks off of the shaft. I had several of these self-destruct in this way, so this appears to be a fundamental limitation of this tool. Bottom line, this is probably ok for drilling, but don't expect to use this to drive screws or other fasteners."
5,Works great,Love this. Works really great when you have a weird angle or just can't fit the entire drill into the space where you have to work.
1,Fell apart,I drilled exactly 11 small holes with this thing befor it fell apart. I was installing cabinet door closers for my kitchen cabinets. I can't imagine this product holding up under any significantly heavy use if it couldn't withstand that.
4,Soothing & Peaceful,"Nice, soothing sounds. Pleasant, easy-to-hear vocals. The CD has a tasteful simplicity that is quite peaceful. (Perhaps ""Mary Mary"" could be a bonus track on future pressings...)"
3,The Best thing next to a time machine,"This novel presents you an image of what the life of European upper classes was like in the 19th century, their never ending parties and balls, their courtships, the perennial presence of war. It's interesting to observe how the persons were full-fledged adults by their late teens. And it was accepted as a normal thing that your children could die at any moment, be it in combat, for the sons, or during child labour if they were daughters.This novel has as a background the Napoleonic Wars and several historical characters have intermittent cameos like Emperors Napoleon and Alexander, their generals, etc.There is also an interesting mention to Freemasonry and its rites. It's thick as a brick, do not despair, continue reading, even if it is some pages every day, at the end you'll enjoy it."
3,Very overrated,"This book is an embodiment of proof that the plot of a novel could theoretically have no end. It just drags on and on. ""Yes, I want to get married, no I don't want to get married, oh wait, yes, I do."" Plus, the nationalistic flavour of the novel bothers me. It's a ""good"" book, but by no means superb. Plus, the political essays are annoying."
4,nice format and background data,. the text was clear and esay to seeThe format of the book was great.Also allot of background info thanks
5,A masterpiece of the mind,"This book was the first 'complex' book I read. I have now read it three times, and I wish to do so again. It is an interplay of the subtle and the obvious, from Pierre's struggle to find peace to the innocent young Natasha's love for Prince Andrey, and Bezuhov. But what affected me most was Tolstoys ruminations on the nature or war and life. His logic is concise, flawless yet has a depth beyond that of any other I have read. His final argument, that argues that we must depend on something we do not understand is so perfect I can find no flaw. It is the only argument that proves there must be a God that I can't attack. War and Peace is a large commitment to read, but once you have finished, you will be more than what you were. That is a guarantee."
5,War and Peace,Tolstoy has a way with words in describing the surroundings and feelings of his characters and scenes. Tolstoy puts everything into a clear picture of what is going on during that time and place.
5,This book was very interesting and breath taking.,I thought that this book was the best book that anyone could ever read. When you start reading you just can't stop because you can't wait to read what is going to happen next. I am really glad I decided to read it.
2,Too Long yet still can be interesting,This book was a very interesting book but for me it was extremely long. I had a lot of work to do and therefore it took me a very long time to read. I can see why some people may like this story but it has too many sub plots and too many pages. If you have a long time to read a story and you have a thing for Russian history or war in general than you will probably enjoy this story. It is one book that should probably read before you die but don't read it in high school. Just a suggestion.
1,"Actually, I give it 5 stars...",People just skim to the 1 star rankings to see what the dissenters have to say. If you don't have time to read this book then read the cliff notes and skip to the last 80 pages of the book. They're all that really matter.
1,"2nd worst book ever read,","Tolstoy was such self-important, disrespectful, intolerant, bum! Tolstoy insults the intelligence of all people who do not accept his personal version of christianity. I came to detest the characters as amazingly weak, and the story totally unbelievable in its presentation."
5,Exciting and fascinating,"This is a great book - it will hold your attention and bring you back again and again. Dealing with personal relationships and the ambitions and needs of a group of Russian society (young and old) in pre-revolutionary Russia, it will grip you! Long but not verbose (at least compared to other Russians and ""classic"" English writers like Dickens, I thoroughly recommend this book."
5,Long read but worth it.,"War and peace is a long tedious read, not for everyone. It shows an insight into events that shaped our modern world. Translated from French and Russian it reads slow and laborous. It's almost 1200 pages long. Hearing it on my kindle is the easiest way to read it. It's got insights into our modern world that I find myself increasingly interested in. Most people are going to hate it, but a few might find it priceless."
5,perfect,"The fog of war! In tolstoy we see the whole world writ large and small, from the lowest to the highest, the thoughts and complexities of people have never been better expressed."
1,worst translation ever.,"This is an amazing piece of literature, butchered by constance garnett. its simplified, and slightly moronic. i had to stop reading it after about 100 pages and purchase a new copy from another publisher, the amount of spelling mistakes, gramatical errors were really a hindrance. an example on page 171 ""he waked up"" ????? only one of SEVERAL obvious mistakes, please do not buy this particular version of this amazing piece of work, tolstoy would turn over in his grave if he saw his work treated this way, try the SIGNET version, they have lovely versions of all of tolstoys work."
3,Boring,I lost track of all the characters. Who was who. Who was the Little Princess and if there was a Little Princess I guess there was Big Princess lurking around.I didn't finish it.
4,the best,"I listened to a bit of two others and the voices seemed artificial and some anoying. This one did a great job on the voices, all well done"
2,Betty Lawson,"I have always heard of War & Peace, so buying it on Prime, I thought I would it. It was too wordey or worddy & told about the same scene in the same war over, over, over & over again. That said-- there were great pearls of wisdom in it."
1,There's no such thing as a great novel,"While cultural pundits try to convince you that some literature is better than other literature, the truth is that all art is relative to individial tastes. Thus, it doesn't make any sense to think that a novel like this one is really any better than say, Michael Crichton or Stephen King. Aesthetic standards can't be grounded.Thus, don't listen to anyone who tries to distinguish between ""serious"" works of literature like this one and allegedly ""lesser"" novels. The distinction is entirely illusory, because no novels are ""better"" than any others, and the concept of a ""great novel"" is an intellectual hoax."
5,Best reading edition in print,"Yes, ""War and Peace"" is one of the great novels of all time, but it's also one you'll be spending a month or more with when you finally read it, and I enthusiastically recommend this edition when you do. The type is clear, the paper thin but still opaque, and the binding strong but flexible and resilient. I own two other editions, but bought this one just because I found it so readable."
2,Inaccurate and Dated Translation,"The problem with Garnett is not her readability. She wrote a remarkably fluent English prose. The problem is her mistranslations and cavalier treatment of what Tolstoy actually wrote and meant. My Russian literature teacher at Hunter College (Tolstoy's grandaughter !) said there were bloopers on almost every page. And she regularly paraphrased, turned two sentences into one and generally ""improved"" Tolstoy whenever she felt like it.The Maude or Dunnigan translations are much more respectable."
4,Wonderful book but terrible translation,War and Peace is a must read for many reasons although I do not recommend the translation by Constance Garnett. Try to pick up a copy translated by Aylmer Maude.
5,Golden classic,A golden classic which should be read. The Kindle holds it at just the right size to take anywhere any time.
4,a strange film,"I have to say this is a very odd film, firstly, theres Bruce Lee's character, he's the 5th apprentice, when he's clearly the most talented student( I mean he can make mince meat out of a room full of Japanese, but the others in the school almost never win a fight) secondly its never explained why the Japanese kill his master( thats explained in the 1982 film legend of a fighter)However, the action in this film is spectacular, Bruce shows his amazing talent as a martial artist and an actor.The fight scenesare timeless in their intensity. I reccomend if you are a connoseur of action cinema, you watch this film."
1,"WARNING - Amazon's ""free"" shipping SUCKS!","Note the fine print in amazon's shipping policy:"" It will be delivered to your address but not UNLOADED, unpacked, or assembled. ""This means YOU will be responsible for getting the item OFF THE TRUCK when it is delivered to your home. That's over 4 feet off the ground.

4,Traditional Eastern,"The Mother of Trilok, this is a recording of Indian style ragas and the likes. It is very good from a world view perspective. This is traditional Eastern music, not fusion. If you like Ravi Shankar, you may like this. All acoustic with no synthesized effects at all. The pieces are metered with a slower percussive pulse than much of Ravi's material. Her voice is not an American or anglo style voice, but it adds to the flavor of the music. Great spin!"
2,Not a good fit,"This is the case listed on the box of our new Sony digital camera, but it actually didn't fit very well. It's slightly too tight when one slides the camera in, and the case is too long so there's a 1/2 inch of empty space on the end once the camera is inside. I think it's a carrying case designed to fit a multitude of cameras rather than one specific shape. If you're looking for a custom case that fits perfectly, skip this case. Mine's in the trash."
2,Dimensions are wrong,"It seems like a nice case, but the interior dimensions (3.125 x 4.5 x 1.6875 inches) listed in the technical details are way off. If they were even close, it would fit my camera (Sony DSC-H55), but now I'm returning it."
1,BEWARE...THE WHITE... AFRO!!!,"The special effects are so stupid, they sit on the TV and watch the couch! ...Do I apologize for that cheap joke? No. Why? Because cheap, insulting jokes are all that his piece of excretion deserve! The film is about a black family living in a house that some white guy lived in during the civil war. There is only one white person in the entire movie with speaking lines, and he resembles a hillbilly that I have the misfortune of knowing. The book that this is based on is bad enough, but this toilet-leftover is even worse. Believe me, after you see it you will fear... the WHITE AFRO OF PLUTO!!!"
4,Pretty darn Good!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I loved it it was a fun movie the ending could have been better but other wise it was a good movie.SO I HIGHLY RECCOMAND IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,House Of Dies Drear,This is a hit and miss movie.Great actors!but some are a lil over the top!but this vid was some years ago lol
2,The House of Dies Drear,While the overall theme was interesting (a ghost from the days of slavery inhabiting a house) the film maker did a poor job at the film and I had a very difficult time keeping the attention of my 8th graders.
3,www.imdb.com,"This is a very strange movie with elements of history, some comedy and horror. I remembered being scared of it as a kid, and as an adult I can still appreciate this film.It's basically the story of a young black man and his family who move into a historic house that was owned by Dies Drear, a Dutch abolitionist who hid slaves and helped them escape to freedom. There is a rumored treasure hidden somewhere on the land. The family soon begins to suspect that the ghosts of slaves who passed through there are haunting the house when they meet a strange man who seems to know many secrets."
3,Pretty good fantasy book for young readers,"I received this book from a giveaway on goodreads.com. I thought it was an ok book, needs some inprovement though. When I first got it even the cover put me off a little because it's not that great of graphics (even for the age range). I did enjoy the plot, but some places dragged a little where details got to overly talked about when they didn't seem that significant. And, for a younger audience, I think it might be hard for them to keep up with all the different locations and names. But, overall, it was an ok read."
2,Prejudiced views,"The prejudice of the author comes through loud and clear from the dedication to Bill and Hillary to the bashing of conservative views at every opportunity. I was extremely disappointed. It's the last of Greeley's books that I'll waste my time reading. Also, it was much too easy to figure out who and what was happening."
2,Last Greeley Book I'll read,"As others have said, this book is really an apology for the Democratic party. That would be fine, but I would expect better of someone of Father Greeley's intellect than repetitive phrases such as ""Republicans have always been good at stealing things, especially elections."" By the way, where was the ACLU when there was a mass said in the White House. A building belonging to the people of the United States, terrible, terrible, the sky will probably fall on us all now. I stopped in disgust three quarters of the way through the book. I had already figured out the ending anyway."
3,I'ts OK!,"I am a little disappointed. As much as I like Andrew Greeley and especially his Bishop Blackie mysteries, I felt it had far too much politics in it and not enough story!"
3,The Bishop in the Weat Wing,The Bishop in the West Wing: A Bishop Blackie Ryan NovelJust not as good as the others he has written in the past.
2,The Bishop in the West Wing,"I consider this book much too polarizing to recommend it as a fun read for the general public. The focus was too political. The author vilified conservative republicans and glorified liberal democrats. He then had the audacity to have the President (liberal democrat of course) denounce partisanship. He also seemed to negatively stereotype the Christian religious right in order to support an Irish Catholic power team in the White House. If you have a particular disdain for Republican-Conservative Christians, this book will resonate with you."
4,Political but still entertaining,"Greeley's political views come out a bit strong but the history is entertaining as is the story. I would not recommend this a your first Blackie Ryan Mystery, Begger Girl and Missing L Train are better."
2,First and last book by a priest,"This book took me forever to read because it was extremely slow-paced and uneventful. The idea of poltergeist attacks sounded interesting to me but this book focused more on the sour relationships between the Democrats and Republicans in office than the acutal poltergeist attacks (which were more of a side note). I also found the character of Bishop Blackie to be rather annoying. Perhaps though, I just do not like political novels."
2,Zzzzzzzzzzzzz,"Decided to give this group a try after hearing one of there songs randomly. HUGE disappointment, so bland, empty, boring, and underproduced. Sounds like this was made in my bedroom, or something you'd hear in an elevator at some trendy hotel. LAME."
3,"Nice, but not up to their earlier work.","Not bad, but not up to the level of Ardor or Ever, of which I particularly enjoyed the latter. The electronic dance beat just interfered a little too much with the underlying etheral quality of their music, which is what I enjoy about LSD. I just found myself wishing that the dance beat would either ease into the background or go away altogether, so I could enjoy the music."
2,Surely a Downward Spiral.,"Love Spirals Downwards, ""Flux"", was purchased for me as a gift, a further exploration of a band I'd found to be a godsend, to say the least. Unfortunately, LSD's magical work was laid to rest, in favor of a more poppy, electronika sound for ""Flux"". If you're a lover of LSD's earlier work, then this album will be depressing for you. If you instead enjoy trip-hop, or soundscapes that mirror that of some technological lounge music, I still wouldn't recommend ""Flux"". I love LSD, but the electronic midi-work and poor drum sampling of ""Flux"" more than compromise Suzanne Perry's otherwise seraphic vocals, and send the album in a Downward spiral of its own (excuse the pun). Decent tracks exist, such as ""Alicia"", but if you wish to explore the true passion of LSD, turn to their better works..which is *any* of their other material."
2,A bad dose of Love Spirals Downwards,"I am a huge fan of Love Spirals Downwards. Unfortunately, ""Flux"" is a flawed and disappointing album. There are some good songs (""Alicia,"" ""I'll Always Love You,"" ""Nova"" and ""Sound of Waves""), but they are all sabotaged by the lousy mixing on this CD. For evidence of this, listen to LSD's excellent compilation, ""Temporal"" -- two of the three tracks from ""Flux"" have been (thankfully!) remixed into more engaging incarnations.As another reviewer correctly pointed out, on this album LSD removes the Gothic cloak in favor of sterile, too-fast trip-hop drum machine rhythms. Stylistically and technically, ""Flux"" just doesn't work (even Suzanne Perry's lovely voice is not sufficient redemption); you will be disappointed. The kindest description I can give to this album is: experimental. If you're new to LSD, start with ""Temporal"" or ""Ever"" -- both excellent albums."
2,So ethereal as to lack any content,"I purchased this CD on the strength of one track and that turns out to be a mistake. Almost the entire album is so ethereal and breathy that it makes no impression. Even ambient, soothing music needs to have enough substance to impress a mood and this one fails to meet that standard. This CD is so weak that I would slot it in below ambient. Call it ""background music for background music."""
5,AWESOME!!!,"This is an AMAZING group. They are so tight, it is obvious that they have been playing together for a long time. The ""Warrior"" lays down some awe inspiring grooves on the Sousaphone with blinding technical accuracy. John Stevens at the University of Wisconson-Madison has put out a monster player in Nat McIntosh. The rest of the horn section is tight as well. It is obvious that these are trained and very talented musicians. ""Better musicians, Better Music"" The group is a great blend of traditional ""second line"" brass band in the New Orleans style with hip-hop, soul, and some TASTY funk. Buy it and ENJOY!!! ""You Won't be wearin' a frown when Youngblood comes to your town"""
2,"Good, but why so Explicit","The Youngblood Brass Band is an excellent band. I like their tight ensemble playing. Their solos are adequate, except for the sousa player, who is fantastic. It is too bad that they feel the need to curse constantly during the tunes. I am not a fan of rap in general, but their early albums were good, because it didn't get in the way of the fine playing too much. I hate to pay so much for one of their rare CDs to have half of the music go in the toilet, because of the language."
3,pumped,"I've heard their first disc, and have seen them live a number of times. I know how long they spent on this album, and I have to say I was a little disappointed. It's a fun album to listen to, but I was expecting a little more from these guys. And I think they can bring it. I'm waiting for the next one patiently. What's up with the Willis guy?"
2,come on boys,"I dig the band. I've seen them twice. I think they're live shows are great, but the album's kind of boring. The Kweli and Ladd tracks are tight. It sounds too produced, not as live as they really are. Written solo too? Sounds like it. Stick to what you're great at guys. I'd wait for the next one. Tuba player plays some bomb stuff though."
5,Wow!,"I have to start off by saying that I have not yet heard this album, but I just saw these guys playing on the corner of 5th and Pine here in Seattle during my lunch break. These quys were incredible! You would not believe the crowd they had surrounding them to listen to their infectious mix of hip-hop, New Orleans brass, jazz, and funk. They were absolutely rock-solid tight, screaming, and stopping traffic. I was only able to stick around to listen to three songs, but I just couldn't believe what I was hearing. I had to hop online as soon as I got back into the office and order their CD, and I am for sure going to go out for their live show tomorrow night. Too much."
5,Highly recommended!!!,"I attended a lecture on parenting teens by Paul Dorin (who has real life experience raising teens)at Torrance Memorial Hospital in January 2006. Great info he presented and so I bought 2 of these books, one for me and one for my sister who has 2 teen sons. Even though she hardly sits still to read any book, she opened this book and got hooked to where she could barely stop reading it until she was finished. She gave it to her younger teen son who also zipped through it and greatly enjoyed it.I haven't opened my book yet for lack of time, but can't wait, based on my sister's enthusiasm! If my overly busy sister and her son devoured and loved Crickets on the Moon, it's really got to be good!!Annette Silas"
5,Thoroughly enjoyable,"I found this autobiography by Virgil Thomson thoroughly enjoyable. I was led to read it after seeing his name consistently referenced by some leading historiographers of the 20th century such as Joseph Horowitz and Harvey Sachs. Reading this work has encouraged me to do a little more research into his life since he is extremely shy about sharing his private life, especially any events that demonstrated his homosexuality. If he was so concerned about hiding this rather important part of his personality, I could not help but to wonder how much else he portrayed in veiled sequences. Nonetheless, his obvious brilliance and the delectable way that he uses the English language makes his story telling absolutely riveting. I just don't know how much of it is true."
2,Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz,"I had expected a livelier writing style. Instead, this book was not moving along. Whether/not it was Thomson's writing style or content--I expected much more about his experiences in Paris--it is good for one thing: zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz."
2,fairly dull book,The book had some interesting parts but was overall a dull experience. It did prompt me to take a Namibian safari but overall it was below average.
4,Good stuff,"While I am now into herbal shampoos and conditioners, Pert Plus with Light Conditioner is a cheap but effective way to clean the scalp without paying much money at all. I love the scent and the light conditioning is perfect for my oily scalp. Definitely for those who want a good shampoo for less money."
1,Animal Cruelty,"I suppose director Souleymane Cissé was going for stark realism in his film, but is torching a live rooster not considered exessively and criminally cruel in his country? Just thought I'd leave this warning for animal lovers and those sensitive to animal cruelty. The film opens with a close up of a real live rooster in flames and screeching in agony. I was so sick to my stomach, I threw away the dvd. There are pleanty of great world films that don't include authentic inhumane acts against animal life... inflicting pain and death upon a helpless living creature for the sake of ""art."" A waste of $27."
5,"Great product, great price, and great service!","Ordered this dining room set for my parents for Christmas. It was shipped and arrived on time, and it's a beautiful set. It DOES NOT come assembled, which is okay, since we're a handy bunch. But my brother-in-law did spend most of a day putting it all together. The table and chairs are sturdy, the color is great, and after having dealt with the company on two separate occasions, I can honestly say the customer service was awesome! They were willing to do what was necessary to get the set delivered to my parents small home way back in the country, and they were willing to quickly send a replacement leg for one of the chairs that wasn't cut right. I'm very pleased. My parents are very pleased. And we'll likely buy more from these folks in the future!"
4,It is pretty nice.,"I really like the overall look of the product and how sturdy it is. However, it did come with some small dents and scratches in the table."
4,"Good value, with lots of assembly","This dining room set is solid and attractive. I would concur with most of the positive reviews, especially those that observed that the ""solid"" wood is composed of lots of interlocked little pieces, but that unlike many such interlocked tabletops, this one looks pretty natural. Nobody will think this table is ""fancy,"" but neither will anyone sneer (unless they are the type to sneer at everything). For the price, the quality will be tough to beat, even for very aggressive shoppers.This set takes a long time to assemble. I sped things up considerably by cutting off the end of the included L-shaped Allen wrench so that I could put it in my power drill. Nonetheless, assembly took me nearly 3 hours.I bought this item through Vision Decor. They were not particularly communicative about when the item would ship, but once the item got off backorder, they and the shipping company were great."
5,7pc Mission Style Solid Hardwood Dining Table & 6 Chairs Set,7pc Mission Style Solid Hardwood Dining Table & 6 Chairs Set my wife picked this out and its a very nice and heavy set. Nothing cheap about this set. Well worth the money.
2,"A misleading title, not much science.","I must say upfront that this book has very little if anything to do with science besides some obscure inferrences drawn between creation and religion. Considering the title I was certainly disappointed. However, trying to move past the title and the contents one finds a belief that man is essentially evolving past the need for an omnipotent God much less a personal one. To make matters worse, his attempts at Christianity and attempts at reducing Jesus to man with a vision come right out of the late 19th century with more recent vocabulary. This book lands squarely in the Ba'hai faith without much imagination. Drawing some teachings out of Kabbalism, I strongly believe that this book would disappoint even most Kabbalists."
5,!An apassionate book!,"In our times, it's important to enjoy ourselves, and feel that we are in a beautiful and neverending world. You can feel it, when you raise the point between science and God, and you can see that, day by day, we are integrate our technology and our souls in one, and now we can realize this, seeing that with science, we can find our mind, body and universe toghether. With this book, you will feel more unit with the Divine and with the whole universe. !Don't miss it!"
2,A cold theology bordering on pantheism.,"Daniel Matt has written a book attempting to integrate modern physics and ancient theology. For his effort he comes up with a 20th century quantum version of deism -- the view that God started the universe and then walked away, leaving the clock (or the waves and particles) to fend for themselves. The trouble is that such a universe and such a God have nothing to say about ethics and even less to say about the practices we should engage in to enoble and sanctify our lives. What we are left with is a cold theology which sees God in energy and in matter, but not in the soul. Such a God is literally ""no-thing."" For a better attempt at a similar synthesis I would refer readers to Lawrence Kushner's ""The River of Light."""
5,ohmigod there's a yeerk in his head?!!!,"this is probably my fav animorph book. i have all 19 ( plus mm1, mm2, and the andalite chronicles). i love it when jake is trying to get the yeerk out, and how it morphs him and stuff like that. i especially love how ax morphs jake and he goes to cassie's and eats. is jake a controller forever? read and find out!!!!"
3,Oh my god... Jake has a Yeerk in his head (cool),Oh my god there is a yeerk in Jake's head. Temrash one-one-four is in Jake's head. How will the Yeerk get out? Will he be a controller forever? Read the book to find out.
5,K. Applegate makes you come back for more!,"Jake can morph into any animal he touches. His brother is controlled by a Yeerk. The problem is that the Yeerks are going to control the hospital. If that happens, you could go to the hospital with a broken foot and come out a Yeerk! AGH! The mayor is scheduled for surgery and Jake has fallen into the Yeerk pool. What will happen to planet Earth and it's people? Read this and all K. Applegate's books to feel like you have morphed into another animal! It's cool!"
5,AWESOME,"THIS BOOK IS A MUST FOR ANIMORPHS FANS. IT IS IN MY OPINION THE BEST ANIMORPHS BOOK. The animorphs find out about an evil plan by the yeerks to infest the governer.Since the governer is going to run for president, this is bad.When the animorphs go to the hospital and find a portable yeerk pool. You'll have to read to find out the rest."
4,"Four and a half, actually","This one's good fun, as well as taking us into the mind of a Yeerk for the first time. Important? Yes. Better written than most of the later ones? Definitely. Embarrassing for a 17-year-old to buy? No question.Need to break my habit."
5,"Jake's a controller, the enemy...","Okay class, now we will learn about Yeerks. Yeerksare slimy gray slug looking alien parasites. They slither into your head through your ear. When they reach your brain they turn into a liquid and wraptheir bodies over your brain, filling every crack and space they can find. Hey! Listen! That's better, now where was I? Oh, yes. I remember. It's an unpleasent thing. Ask Jake, he'll know. That happened to him recently. He fell into a yeerk pool and became a controller, the enemy..."
5,The yeerk was controlling his body.,"WHAM!!! A sledge hammer blow. Jake fell head first into the yeerk pool, the place full of disgusting, slimy water full of gray slugs, yeerks. Alien parasites that control people's minds. They slither into people's heads and fill in every crack and space they can find. A yeerk did just that. Now Jake's a controller, the enemy"
5,The Best Animorphs Book...Without a Doubt,"Without a doubt, this is THE best Animorphs book. It goes so deep into the feelings of Jake, the feelings of defiance, it's just wonderful."
1,"Don't get me wrong, but.........","I just didn't like it. It must've been one year since I've read and enjoyed the Animorphs books. Buut now, in fifth grade, I suddenlly think that it's gross, weird, and defenitly childish. I mean, think about it-aliens names like the Andalites, the Yeerks, the Hork-Bajir, and Visser Three? Pul-e-e-z-e. Even the Harry Potter books are better, which I vote ***** stars. (Actually, I vote more than five stars. Like ten stars)Anyway, J.K. Rowling is even better than K.A Applegate!"
5,It was absolutly the best in the series!,"If you only read one book in your whole life, this should bethe book. It is neat, cool, and scary all at the same time. This bookis GREAT!"
5,Very cool.,"If you're an ANIMORPHS fan, this is one book you can't miss!When the Animorphs find out that the new hospital isactually a recruit center for Yeerks, they're off again,as flies. But when Jake falls into a yeerk pool, he becomesone of them. A ""must-read""!"
5,The best!!!,"I think this is the best Animorphs book, and I have read almost all of them. It could be because Jake is my favorite character, but I don't think so. You have to read it!!!!"
4,One of My Holiday Favorites,"I first saw this movie in high school, and I've never forgotten it. Three Jewish children flee the Nazis and must take refuge at a small Catholic school in France. Strong performances from Loretta Swit and the rest of the cast. A wonderful message about tolerance. Viewers of all faiths will appreciate the beauty of the miracle of Hanuukah. Truly inspiring."
5,Incredible movie!,I first saw this movie when released to my local PBS station. I tried for years to find this movie. It is so well done. Loretta Swit was awesome. This movie opened my eyes to many of the Jewish tradtions and meanings and how they relate directly to my own Christian faith. Watch with open eyes and heart. You may find something out about yourself that you did not think of before viewing.
3,Miracle at Moreaux,The video arrived in good condition. It is a movie version of a book Twenty and Ten by Claire Huchet Bishop about group of Jewish children sent to a French refuge during WWII. The movie is loosly based on the book. The book was much better.
2,syncretism is the theme,"B-rated type film, fair quality.We bought this film for Khanukkah, and watched it and thought ""oy veh."" The audience is encouraged to embrace both Khanukkah as well as Xmas (though Xmas is observed by the majority of the cast). Without wanting to use this review as a forum to discuss Xmas at this time, let's just say if you want an Xmas film that's what you'll get....but if you want a Khanukkah film...you'll be disappointed. For our personal beliefs in the Biblical and historical accuracy of Khanukkah, and it's relationship to Israel & the Messiah, we'd say ""don't buy."" Bummer."
3,OK But......,"This book(Fangs of Morning) had it's good points and bad points. While it strated out good,it got confusing and kind of flopped torward the end.The Alchemist was not very good.It had more sex in it than horror.It was OK but..."
2,Not Worth The Buy,"Only good tracks are The Pilfers and Metro Stylee's ""Evil Eyes""... Sorry, but two songs are not worth the whole rest of the untalented CD - Sorry. This gets 2 stars, One star for each good song on the album."
2,Where's the Birds!,"It is cute, but for some reason my birds won't go to it. I think maybe the hole for them to go into is too small."
1,Why???,"Why is this updated superior version out of print and only the earlier edition available?With new dvd prices above $200, this situation is intolerable, Image! At the very least, a blu-ray version is due, yes?"
5,Parent's Choice Award,"Having never read the book I found this movie very inspiring. Elnora reminds us that we should never give up on our dreams.....and our dreams are our own to make - or to lose. And in the end she also discovers the truth behind a secret which has kept her emotionally separated from her mother. This story has many life lessons which are perfect for children but will remind everyone who sees it what the meaning of ""living"" is about."
1,Bad tape,"I was eager to watch this version of The Girl of the Limberlost as I have enjoyed Wonderworks productions in the past. I have been unable to get through the movie because about every 15 minutes it stops, my VCR shuts off and the tape is ejected. It is a new player and this hasn't happened with any other VHS tapes I have so I have to assume that it has something to do with the tape. It would cost me more to send it back so I haven't bothered to return it. It was very dissappointing to me."
5,A Girl of the Limberlost,"Item arrived in timely manner, haven't gotten to watch it yet, but it did arrive in a sealed package! Great experience with this seller on my purchase! Recommend seller!"
1,Amazon's DVD has no sound track.,None of Amazon's DVDs of this movie have a sound track.It is cruel to offer it to unsuspecting customers with no sound track.
1,Horrible!,"""A Girl of the Limberlost"" is one of my favorite books. I was so happy when I discovered it had been made into a movie. How disappointed I was that the movie was just terrible! The movie ended in the middle of the book leaving me to say, ""huh?"" when the credits started to role. The movie illiminated three major characters crucial to the plot and the charm of the book and altered one character so badly that the essence of his personality was completed misinterpreted. The pacing of this movie was slow, slow, slow. I suffered through it. Save your money! It's not even worth renting. What a shame that a beautifully written book did not translate to video. A great opportunity was missed! Save your time and money!"
1,Quite simply dreadful -- how about NO stars?,"I'm having trouble accepting that the writers of this film actually read the book on which it was based. Other than mother-daughter conflict, an interest in nature, and the time period in which it was set, the book and the movie have almost nothing in common. Most of the important characters are missing, key plot elements have been left out, and the personalities of the characters who do remain have been distorted beyond recognition. I find myself wondering why they made the movie at all. No one who loved the book would find anything appealing in this disappointing effort. My real regret is that someone might see this movie before reading the book. They would never want to pick up the wonderful novel."
1,generalistic info,too general in content. much of this information is copied from articles posted elsewhere and it just doens't seem like it is comprehensive or insightful. it doesn't give enough --- leaves you wanting alot more information and leaves you with alot of unanswered questions. author gives statistics and examples but no real ideas for solving this problem.
3,fighting mad,"when the movie is letterbox some of the most important picture is cut off, i very much dislike letterbox dvds. thank you"
5,Derek Sherinian! The Future of Fusion Music!,"What's the deal with all the whining about this record? Why complain about this kind of music? Anybody that has been lucky enough to discover Derek's music should be thankful. Think of what a sorry shape mainstream music is in these days then think of the greatest keyboard player on the planet who hires the best guitar players to be had to play on his records then ask yourself WHAT AM I COMPLAINING ABOUT? Man this guy rocks! Every cd he has recorded is a must for people that want to have their brainwaves stimulated. I Highly recommend Blood Of The Snake. I have to ask myself have any of these negative reviewers ever heard Black Sabbath, Jeff Beck, or Dream Theatre? Will the real Heavy Music lovers please stand up? I have!"
2,With all the big names it still comes up excruciatingly short,"I'm curious what the initial concept for this album actually was. I popped it in to my CD player expecting to be blown away by blistering keyboard leads (ala Jordan Rudess and Kevin Moore) but instead was greeted by a VERY guitar heavy album devoid of any real direction and loaded with half- hearted improvisational solos. The fact that Derek refuses to take center stage on his own album is absolutely dumbfounding and profoundly disappointing.To make matters worse, a large portion of the songs sound as if they were the rejects from a BLS or Malmsteen recoding session and were probably written mostly by the guitarists themselves rather than Sherinian. The final song ""In The Summertime"" does not belong on the CD at all (except maybe as a hidden track) and fails to bring an appropriate ending to an already sub- par album. Derek, if you don't like taking the lead on your own song's than don't bother to put out a solo album."
3,Progressive Rock with a Heavy Edge,"Derek is one of the best keyboardists. This is some of his best work. However, I enjoy his work with Dream Theater, and Planet X better. The whole slew of musicians that play on this album doesn't really impress me. Um Derek, how is it that you can only get one song or so out of each of these musicians? Anyway, if you want to know who the greatest musicians are in the biz today, this album is a good introduction to them."
3,Simply uninspired,"There is *some* fantastic talent on this CD, but rolling through the songs, you'd think this was a b-sides album. If you just want some plain old progressive rock, here it is. I probably would have rated it 2 stars, but I only listened to it a few times at a friend's place. So, I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt."
3,"old ""skool' kung fu","On like the other two fools who rated this flick a 1 star, simply because they inadvertently came across it by accident,,looking for some rock group called ""The Stomp"" I'm actually rating this flick for the actual cinematography and choregraphy, and must say it's not bad. This flick actually has a tight plot. It's about a secret kung fu manual which everyone wants,,,this manual hold the secret of ancient and secret kung fu. The manul was actually tattooed on the back of,,,well,,I won't spoil it for you,,,but I do recommend you check it out. It has many swords play,,aswell, an equal amount of real old skool kung fu fighting!!! This flick is not the best I've seen, but it sure as hell does not deserve a 1 star, by the previous goofs!!"
1,Not related to STOMP (dance/music group)!,"This is a martial arts video from the late 60's; if you're looking for STOMP, the dance group that uses various things to make sound with, don't buy this tape!"
4,Very Good Atmospheric Black Metal,"When I first heard Christcrusher, I was not really all that Impressed. My first reaction was this sounds like Dimmu, Graveworm and every other Atmospheric Black Metal Group out right now. After listening to the album a little deeper, my first Impression was wrong. This album is very melodic, serene and has it's own Identity. The track Christcrusher is extremely brutal and almost doesn't fit the rest of the album, but I'm not complaining. This release offers a lot to the genre, it's well played and the production is perfect. The vocals are very evil sounding, the clean vocals don't sound like Progressive Metal and the acoustic guitars and keyboards are blended perfectly. This doesn't sound nearly as assessable as newer Dimmu releases but still has that Epic feel to it. Add this to your collection and you will go back to it time and time again. A great addition to a your Black Metal Collection!"
4,Christmas in Paradise,A really good movie for families.... Children are involved and it relates to everyone. A good story ..... ENJOY! Glad I chose this one.
5,Leslie Sansone Fat Burning Walk 2 miles.,I have several of Leslie's tapes and try to change every few days to keep it interesting. This one is challenging for me but not impossible. I love working out at home. At first I found Leslie a bit chatty but she grew on me and now I enjoy her tapes. Other members of my family use her tapes also and everyone of us feels we get a good workout with them. I will keep using all her tapes. Guess you can say I'm a fan!
4,A gentle but effective aerobic & strengthening workout,"This tape is ideal if you're new to exercise, recovering from illness, or just not one of those hard-core exercise-types. The workout is quick (about 31 minutes) and low-impact. You'll still be able to get our of bed the next morning after doing this workout. But you will get your heartrate up, work up a sweat, and tone your muscles. And when you get the hang of it, you can do the same moves on your own when you're travelling or just can't get to play the tape for whatever reason. When you get stronger, increase the intensity by adding ankle weights and heavier hand weights (maximum 2 lbs). Leslie is upbeat without being obnoxious. She is motivating and genuine."
4,walk don't jog,This is a nice home excercise video. It takes very little room and can be done by anyone of any age.
4,Great for in home use,Would recommend to all ages who cannot get to a gym or outside. Don't need a lot of room and you don't need to be in great shape to accomplish all that is asked for in this video. All instruction is clear and precise and easy to follow. A great workout in a short period of time!
5,Exercising for Dummies,"I really loved this tape because it is extremely easy to follow and goes by very quickly (it covers two miles of walking plus light weight training and warm up/cool down in about 30 minutes). If you are looking for something very simple this is the tape for you because there are no complicated instructions or steps. The tape is probably best suited for people at low to moderate levels of fitness. People who are already in shape or are used to complex aerobics may find this tape is not challenging enough. But for somone who just wants a straight foward way to get your blood pumping, this is a good choice. This would be great for anyone who is ""aerobics-impaired"" and finds most tapes too complex to follow."
3,"Watch is pretty, but not durable","The watch looks very good. However, near the latch, where my arm is always resting on my desk, the silver has worn away to revel some copper or bronze underneath."
1,This book was terrible!,"I have been reading romance for years, and this book is practically for babies. The excitement is barely lukewarm. The premise had such great potential, but it was never really developed. It was a complete waste of time, which is a shame because I've read some of her other books and they were good."
5,"Handy, powerful enough and reliable","What a great tool and a terrific price. This power tool has endured more work than any powertool I own for work on our boat, Raggedy Edge. Grinding fiberglass, rough sanding wood, This thing comes thru a cloud of fiberglass snow with flying colors. Powerful yet manageable even with fore handle removed to get into the tight quarters of a boat. This tool with a 36 grit ""flapper"" style pad with chew thru anything. One of my all time favorite power tool purchases."
5,One of the best Canadian novels,"Morley Callaghan was one of the best Canadian novelists and short story writers, dating back to the period of the Paris exiles of the late 1920s. He has deserved a greater reading audience than he has ever received, sadly. This is one of his finest novels."
3,Ghost Game,"Not what I thought it would be but it was alright. There is some entertainment value but I would say it is very similar to maybe a Freddy Kruger movie although the killers are aspirations of witches. A little hard to follow, definitely a little bit low budget, but well put together and I was able to sit through it."
2,CRAP!!!,"This movie was CRAP!! I scratched the screen on my laptop, sniffed and smelled CRAP!!! Oh well, another poor ""PRIME"" movie!! You get what you pay for..."
1,LAME with a capital yawn.,About one of the lamest movies I've seen. I think my sandwich for lunch had more talent than the actors. I hope they didn't get paid for their performances. At least they can relish in the thought that anything they did after this movie couldn't be worse.
3,Do you like bad horror movies?,"As someone who enjoys bad horror movies, this was pretty good. That's why it gets 3 stars.There aren't many redeeming qualities to this movie, if you're actually looking for something truly frightening to watch.The social interaction is either completely unrealistic, or these characters are horrible people. They're upset about death for maybe five seconds, then perfectly willing to run around in the woods pursuing the supernatural and joking about death with one another.The dialog is awkward and unnatural.The girls are gorgeous... I assume the guys are friends of the people who made it. They're not ugly, but they're quite average. I don't think anyone was selected particularly for their talent.It would be awesome to be in a movie like this, though. It looks like fun."
1,3 Skanks In Goth Glitter Makeup As Witch Ghosts Who Kill,"(see review title) Do NOT inspire terror. If anything, I kept waiting for one of the poor chicks running around in this movie to hold them down and do their make-up and hair. SO not scary, scattered and fragmented storyline. It is kinda like a ripoff of MOTEL HELL.Deranged/Motel Hell (Midnite Movies Double Feature)Problem?? Motel Hell was better if you can imagine that. It is available here as a double and even triple feature or for immediate watching on instant video. The ending of this movie is a direct rip off of Motel Hell. Oh Lord I want my hour back. Save your time, avoid this as even the babes cannot save this movie. The blonde was the only good actress in it and she DIES."
1,Thoughtless pap,"Even a lover of horror films will find it hard to get jiggy with the horrible production values, the mysogyny, poor casting, chauvinism, and directorial idiocy of this movie. The witches, alone, are worth dropping this one in the garbage bin. Strictly for people who think ""Elimidate"" is a cool show."
1,"Dreary, terrible","I can't believe people gave this terrible movie 4 or 5 stars. It's one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The acting is terrible and the story isn't much better. The grainy, shot-on-video look gives it a ""Blair Witch Project"" feel...but even that couldn't redeem it. Oh, and forget the cover - you don't get any special effects like that in the movie.As far as plot goes, it involves a group of kids who go to a cabin and open up a game, which essentially brings the ghosts of 3 witches back to kill them one by one if they don't understand and complete the game.Don't bother with this one - you'll thank me for it later!"
4,"Einstein and Mileva - ""The Love Letters""","What a wonderful find this book was! Reading it created the opportunity to see into Einstein's mind as well as his heart. I was unfamiliar with the details of Einstein's personal life. This story, what happened to Einstein and Mileva as fellow students, as friends, as physicists, as lovers, as out-of-wedlock parents, and eventually as spouses was interesting and in it's own way, heartbreaking. So much as Einstein's life was revealed in this book. It was truly a fascinating read!"
1,No Wonder its such a deal...,"Just attempted to use it for the first time...won't hold air. A leak at the main connection between the tank and the motor...red loctite seals it, so no moving that without taking the whole thing apart. what a crock. Now I have no box (it was in shambles when it got to me anyway); so I hope I'm not SOL...Amazon help me."
1,Received Smashed From Shipping,The title says it all. Don't expect to use the first one you get. You would expect someone to read these reviews and make corrections.
1,"This is a 1.5 HP compressor, NOT 4.5","Porter-Cable makes fine products however this compressor is grossly under-powered and should really be sold as a 1.5 HP unit. ""Peak horsepower"" may mean ""when you first turn it on"" but it means absolutely nothing once you turn on your sander, sprayer, or wrench."
5,Brilliant book,"Long a fan of Stevens' work, I was delighted to find that an illustrated book of his best-loved poems had be published for kids. ""Thirteen Ways of Looking at a Blackbird"" is my favorite, but there is not a bad poem in the bunch. The soft, evocative pictures are just as terrific, and I will be giving this one as a gift to many young friends."
4,A wonderful challenge,"Beautifully illustrated. Wallace Stevens' poetry is extremely complex. I was surprised to see it as part of Poetry for Young People series. I ordered copies for my grandchildren, and am interested to see their reactions as they grow and mature."
2,College Grads,"This book was written for college grads and not for the man in the street.The first few pages have some merit,but the book gets very complicated and difficult to understand after that.I think that the best trading approach should be simple to understand and easy to follow,this book does not fit thosecriteria.Master the Markets by Tom Williams is a much better reading."
2,Don't wate your money,"I bought this book thinking about the author so called Trade wiz, but his book is ussless. Large font print without any information that beginers dont know. And like the rest like him (T. Demark and his TD indicators]. He dispute all current indicators and create some of his own {DN indicators}."
3,Several good concepts in the book,"I first learned about Joe DiNapoli from an interview on The Personal Investor's Hour. I was impressed enough to listen to the interview twice and check out his book. The book seemed interesting until I read the reviews here. There were 6 ""this is the best book ever written"" anonymous reviews all within 1 week and only 2 other reviews over 3 years. Obviously, the author or his friends writing ""ringer"" reviews. In spite of this I bought the book anyway.There were several good things that I learned. Nothing earth shattering or truly remarkable. You could trade his system and probably do very well.Overall, it was good book and I would buy it again."
4,A little twisted fun,I enjoyed this film because it looked like the filmmakers had a lot of fun making it. Great cast with some very funny moments.
3,I guy film with a touch a sweetness:),"I really enjoyed the film and my favorite characters are the fraternity guys or should I say....you'll see for yourself. Rickey Smiley was completely crazy as usual and A. J. Johnson is still nutty. I would recommend this to anyone that likes stories with a ""Twist"". I get it."
3,Defective CDs,"This was an extremely disapointing experience - not because of the quality of the acting, but rather nbecuase two of the fur CDs were defective! A waste of money"
1,Edward the king,Edward the King.I was so excited to get this recently. I was a little disappointed when I popped it in dvd player to see it was really like a theatre play. I havent ordered dvds before but I rdid expect it to be in he modern format of the classics I watch on pbs.. Is there a button to change it? Or...will it be so good that after a while I will forget about it? thanks for reading!
1,Learning to be interested in British History,"I hated History Class when I went to school. They were boring;tedious dates were given emphasis. Through the vehicle of DVD dramas on History, I am seeing how History can be made alive. An interest, in British History, has been stirred from the viewing of this series. I have been to England several times; now, I shall be more knowledgeable of its historical background."
3,Excellent series...but not a very good quality transfer,"Shame that my favorite all-time BBC dramatic series wasn't (apparently) worthy of BBC video doing it up proper.Although I'm really pleased to finally get this wonderful series on DVD (so far...only Series 1), Acorn Video's transfer quality is patchy to be sure. Episode 6 ""For Love Or Money"" is very burry.When you put in a disc, you do not have the ""play all"" option, either.You have to view each episode one at a time. That's a bad menu choice.All in all, I'm happy to have the series, but the quality is not much better than the offical BBC VHS tapes."
5,LOVED it,"Have always been a fan of British television and this series sucked me right in. Had a hard time stopping at one episode, always wanted to see the next one. Clever writing, fun story line - truly enjoy a strong female character."
3,"B rated filming, cute storyline . . .",Filming is a tad lame but overall decent production. Downton Abby is a much finer series if you like this genre.
5,Great Drama,Well we have only waited ages for this to come to DVD. How long do we have to wait for part two of this excellent drama that captures what is was really like in Edwardian England. Gemma Jones does her best work in this series based upon a real life character Rosa Lewis of the Cavendish Hotel. The series owes its greatness not only to the actors but to creator John Hawkesworth the former producer of Upstairs Downstairs. If you like Drama this is a must have DVD set.
5,Entertaining saga!,This is a very entertaining saga that I have watched beginning to end several times over. I love the characters and and storyline and individual plots to the series.
3,not sure about this one.,"I'm only into episode 2 and I'm already tired of hearing how young and beautiful Gemma's character is supposed to be. I'm sorry but Gemma Jones was in her late 30's when this was filmed and it showed. She would have been almost on her death bed for 1900 and clearly a spinster. I'm just having a lot of trouble considering her a beauty. She's not very attractive in this at all. Also I'm not liking how cheaply made it looks. It looks just like The Young Ones. It reminds me of a stage show. Finally, Gemma Jones speaks so loudly that I'm more annoyed than interested. I'm going to go out on a limb and guess that she was once a great stage actress? I'm going to stick with it for a while but it's no ""Lark Rise to Candelford""."
3,Bought as a gift.,I purchased this book for a friend to whom I had given the software.All I can say is the book was in good shape and arrive in a timely manner.
5,Good power if you need it,"First of all, comparing an el-cheapo Generac ( the cheap ones - not the more expensive stanyby ones) to a Honda GX series engine is like comparing a Kia with a Lexus.Make sure your generator has a brushless alternator design for starters, like this one. The Honda GX series engines are some of the finest around in use for portable power in this range of output.If you have a well and septic pump, if you have electric heat, you will probably need at least this big of a generator. It might be pushing it trying to run an electric hot water heater on this sized generator, though. In any case, if you live in the country, you probably will need at least this much generator, not a small 1-2K generator like someone else wrote."
3,Previous post is mistaken,"Having just returned from Home Depot, the overwhelming majority of generators have a 5 gallon gas tank - only at 7500 watts does the tank go up to 7.5 gallons. My rating of 3 stars is just to get this to post - I have not purchased the generator (yet), but am considering it."
3,campared to honda 350 watts,"the size of the 6500 watt generators gasoline engine is onlly 40% larger than the 350 watt generator sold in hardware stores. that is not intended tocompliment the 6500 watt generator , the engine size and gasoline consumption usage of the 350 watt generator should be improved dramatically. the electrical demand of the average houshold is rated at 1500 watts required.6500 watts is overkill and withh some ajustment 1500 watts should be achievable at 4 gallons a day 2gallons 12 hours usage. some californians should consider this"
5,Beautiful and Tangable,I love these cards. They speak magic to me. The images are amazing and I feel they are less complex than regular old tarot cards. I've had great sucess with these.
3,"Good EP, but Alas Not Great","Dimmu's second EP (if you count the split album with Old Man's Child as an EP) is comprised of two new tracks, one cover, three live recordings and two updated versions of songs from For All Tid. The live recordings are all very good, no complaints. The cover seems rather pointless. The two new tracks are both good with Moonchild Domain being the better of the two. It is the updated versions of the tracks from For All Tid that stand out the most for me. The improved sound quality and arrangments of these songs make them far superior to the originals in my opinion. Overall I recommend this disc to diehards only, newcomers should instead seek out the original version of ""Stormblast"", ""Enthrone Darkness Triumphant"", ""Spiritual Black Dimensions"" and ""Puritanical Euphoric Misantrhopia""."
4,"Great EP, not an outstanding effort though","This is not much of a new record, 3 new songs, 1 old song (that has also be used in other 2 records of Dimmu Borgir: Raabjorn Speiler Draugheimens Skodde) and 3 live songs.The real thrill of the album for me was the live tracks because Dimmu Borgir would never fall in this island for a concert. Good music, not too good sound. But it is worth a try."
2,Forgettable,"I've listened to this a few times and it's incredibly forgettable and ignorable. For some reason, nothing on it captures my attention except the first few moments of the first song."
4,Dimmu Borgir - Godless Savage Garden,Another step in my move to likening some death metal. Dimmu Borgir are pretty good. I like the music.
5,The kings of the black metal throne (despot-Egypt),well this band is considered the best band on earth becasue they mix old class black metal with death metal riffs with a great mixture of keyboards and majestic vocals (shagrath) well this albumn is just great metal heart what a great cover better than the original one. life songs are just as if they are palying them at the aybss studios (peter tagtern) so prfesstional playing .the remastered songs form for all tid just great enough to buy for all tid the seconed edition of this for all tid (nuclear blast) the new 2 songs moon child domain and chaos with out prohecy just great enough to bang u till death well simply dieing to get the awiated spirtuial black dimensions (feb22) phantasmagoria what a great song hail despot group at Egpyt so buy or die all their albums hail amazon
1,A very bad book,"For reasons I can't quite explain, I'm fascinated by books in which a character faces life after loss. For that alone, I expected to love this book. Boy, was I wrong. It's very badly written, the plot is predictable and the main character, Emilia, is utterly unbearable. There is the gay friend, the bitchy ex wife and the cold mother: Love and Other... looks like a book that was not written, but assembled from every cliche available in bad literature."
2,Ehh....,"This book annoyed me, and the characters grated on my nerves by the end, but it was entertaining, I suppose, since I did ultimately finish reading it. In general, books centered around a bitter, grieving person are not really as engaging as this one's description made itself out to be. Also, it seemed very drenched in New York... and I felt outside of its targeted audience, simply because I have never lived there. It felt a bit like hovering on the outside of this clique, and never really connecting with it, which was not something I expected to feel about the setting. And the ""precocious"" 5-year old was UTTERLY UNBELIEVABLE. It wasn't quite girlie enough to qualify as Chick Lit, and, frankly, not good enough to qualify as Literary Fiction. Still, it was certainly a fast read, which is a definite plus!"
2,"a Lifetime TV tale, predictable, with irritating characters","I can't possibly be the only reader who wished for the absolute worst to befall the main character when she told everyone how safe Central Park was and went off on her own! Although all of the characters are either one-dimensionsal or unbearable (even the kid!), and the trite ending (...and a young child shall teach you about love....yada yada... ) is beyond eye-rolling. I would have given this one-star for the irritation of having bothered to read this after a professional review I read of it gave it a rave of some depth... except that Central Park plays a fabulous character here, and even though I hoped all the characters would disappear forever into the park, I thoroughly enjoyed all the details about the park itself."
4,Waldman's Web,"I read this book in one sitting at the Chicago International Airport on Monday. I couldn't put the book down. Unlike others, I really do like her writing (essays/blog). I like her hard honesty about the real messiness of being a parent and being in a long term relationship.I found the book real and the character real- they had flaws and their relationships with one another depicted the reality of blending families, of loss and coping.There were certain passages that I found absolutely mesmerizing. She explained a place or situation well...and others that were written in the chaotic breathless manner that the protagonist was feeling or reeling from.Overall, I would recommend (and have already done so) this book to others."
2,Enjoyment and Other Impossible Pursuits,"This novel was a selection for a book discussion by a member of a group I belong to. Even the title turned me off. But I'm a team player, so I ordered the book and read it. I found the plot to be unoriginal and the characters unlikable, from the narcissistic, indulgent, homewrecking narrator, to her enabling husband, to his autocratic former wife, and their anti-social, simpering prodigy son. The one redeeming feature of the novel is the author's familiarity with the details and fixtures of New York's Central Park, which is the setting for several parts of the plot."
1,Talent is not contagious,"Ayelet Waldman wants everyone to know she is married ""to the novelist Michael Chabon,"" as she mentions on the back of her book. There's an obvious reason: Waldman has no talent, so she must drag her husband's name into her books. Sorry, but talent is not contagious and ""Love and Other Impossible Pursuits"" might be your thing only if you love soap operas or made-for-television movies. It's maudlin, full of cliches (both in prose and characters) and the ending is as terrible as it is predictable. For stale stories with the taste of saccharine, just turn on your television. At least it's free."
1,It's not how much talent you have...,"... it's who you know. Like Plum Sykes, Ayelet Waldman shows that, if you have the right contacts, you can get published, even if you can't write. Thousands of talented writers get turned down every year but Sykes and Waldman get their drivel published. I guess that's just the way it is, and will always be. At least I'll make sure never to read any other book by either of these ""writers."""
1,Talent is the other impossible pursuit!,"Amid the glowing reviews, the only way to get an objective view of this book is to read the 1-star comments from other readers. It would save you from having to read the book and then write the negative comment yourself.This is the first time I've read a novel by Ayelet Waldman and I didn't know that her husband is a famous author -- so I had to judge it by its own merit. And the verdict is that with or without help, the author is a terrible writer!"
3,A Fine Read,"In many reviewers here this book seems to have inspired either love or loathing. I understand that the author is somewhat controversial. My reaction to ""Love and Other Impossible Pursuits"" falls somewhere in the middle. It is not a ""must not miss"" read, but it could be enjoyable. The main character is dangerously close to being unlikeable, but most of the time I was on her side even though I certainly don't approve of her actions in breaking up her husband's first marriage. The stepson, William, is a bit too precocious to be at all believable, but that only serves to emphasize at times how young he really is. I did not notice Waldman's writing, which means it was serviceable if not remarkable. I thought that the character voice was strong and clear. I got very caught up in this book, and it has a great emotional climax and conclusion."
3,Annoying and whiny,"I tried to have sympathy for the main character in this story, but it was quite hard to do so. She was exceedingly whiny, self-centered and annoying. At times her actions toward her stepson bordered on child abuse and were very mean-spirited. The world seemed to owe her something. Granted, she had a tragedy, but so do many people. Move on, sister! She was hard to like."
1,Very Poor Quality,I purchased both a 6R916 Toner Cartridge and 13R553 Drum and the quality when I install either one is terrible. My old ones still work ok but after numerous installations of the new parts the quality is always bad. Black lines and streaks are unacceptable even after shaking the cartridge. These are unusable and I should have dealt directly with Xerox.
4,love affair - everlasting,"being in england in the late 60's, in the airforce, i first heard this great group. i first heard the song ""everlasting love"". i loved the song the first time i heard it. i come back home to the usa and hear another version of the song. i did not like that version, it sounded empty. the reason of course, it was missing the horns.their are two more great songs on the cd, rainbow valley and a daywith out love. i looked for this cd for years and couldn't find it.i would recommend this cd for its beautiful arraignments and the orginalrecording of everlasting love."
5,Graffiti Tribe is the best!!,"I've love Graffiti Tribe ever since I first saw them preform at a local college. They are great!! I also bought their first album, Which is the best. I haven't bought this CD yet, but im planning on it very soon. If it is anything like their first CD or even their live preformances that I have seen, I know I'll Love It!! Graffiti Tribe Rules!"
4,Excellent Book!,"This was a very, very good book. Although it's sad, I thought it was really interesting. It needed more romance, though!I would definetly reccomend this book. It's exciting and you learn a lot about history without even knowing it! I think it's a great way for kids to get to know more about history, definetly!"
2,Fashionable,"This watch met my expectations, it needs to have more adjustable links that you can remove to make it smaller, but it is a fashionable looking watch. And Timex still p.uts out a reliable watch"
1,"Awful, sickening trip-ride.","This movie is disgusting. I'm gay, and I love me some gross out flicks, but poor direction and stupid special effects made this movie a superficial piece of poo. Boo."
1,"So Bad, so very bad","I have no idea what to make of this movie. Should I think of it intellectually as a modern, messed fairytale, or some weird allegory for a degradation in society that fears losing all that it holds dear... No, I think this is just poor cinema, with no sets... little plot that makes any sense, and characters that you can't even remotely care about! This is one of the top 10 worst films I have ever seen! And it's a disgrace to quality Canadian cinema. The only saving grace is Spanky - a twisted Male version of the Wicked witch of the West. But sadly, even his over-the-top performance can't save this film."
5,Hilarious,"""This city is a cash sucking vortex"" - one of my favorite quotes from this book. Long out of print, and outdated on some details, this book is still a scream. I wish someone would update this. Who is Warren D. Leight anyway? War 'N Delight? What kind of name is that?Rudy Guiliani has done such a good job of cleaning up the city that he has made some parts of this book obsolete. Read this book to remember what the subway used to be like."
1,I got a stuffed animal instead of a book!,"I ordered a number of ""How does a Dinosaur"" books and my 3-year old girl loves them. This book, however, did not arrive. I got a stuffed dinosaur (a character from the book) with a ""How do Dinosaurs Get Well Soon"" tag on it, but no book. My daughter really likes the stuffed dinosaur and I see that the book is now listed as out of stock. A well-liked gift for my daughter either way."
5,Excellent for kids & adults,"As a daycare teacher, I read this book to the kids (3 & 4 year olds) over and over. Each time it is a delight to them--they really get involved in the questions the book poses--and to me."
2,not so much,"i love the dinosaur books, but not this one. its very scoldy and didactic, lacking the subtle humorous touch and clever writing of many of the others. if a kid- or an adult- doesn't feel well, then i dont think they should necessarily be encouraged to just keep how they are feeling to themselves."
3,Not as good as the others,"My 3 year old daughter received this for her birthday because she loves ""How do Dinosaurs say good night"" and ""How do Dinosaurs go to school"", but she did not love this book. The writing and the story line is simply not as well written as the other ""how do dinosaurs..."" book. We were disappointed and so was my daughter."
5,Great,"I love these books. Everyone of the books in the series have met mine and my child's expectations. Of course being a boy he loves the dinosaurs and as I the mom, I love the values, manners and morals they teach."
2,lifeless effort,"The fact that you know this album exists means you are a mile's junkie and will buy it. Don't have high expectations.Some of the songs start off promising but don't build into anything. If this had been the original wonderstuff lineup, more effort would have been put into having distinctive basslines, drumbeats, choruses etc. Definitely not as good as any wonderstuff release or hairy on the inside."
4,Fascinating most of the time,"As others have said, not up to par with Green River, but still a fascinating page-turner with a literary edge. I'd love to read more from Willocks, but it looks like he's not going to be cranking them out too quickly.I, too, was a bit mystified by the sketchy explanations of the relationship between Grimes and Jefferson. But it didn't bother me. I like a book that lets me draw some of my own conclusions. I don't need to be spoonfed all the details."
3,Question to those who have read it...,"What exactly happened between Cicero Grimes and Clarence Jefferson?SPOILERS AHEAD...It really isn't explained, I mean, Willocks writes that Jefferson tortured Grimes, but why? And the part where Grimes ""kills"" Jefferson, what was happening there? This is key part in the novel, and it is never really explained.Please email me if you have an answer... JMMPRODS@worldnet.att.net"
3,Ok taste,"Has that after taste of a protein shake, those of you that drink shakes know what I mean. I thought vanilla would be good to blend fruit with but the powder has an overbearing taste. The rich chocolate flavor is much better! We discovered powdered peanut butter ""pb2"" which gives the chocolate drink some ""kick"" :)I like that the calories and fat are low while protein high!! Mixes well in blender-- no clumps. Overall good product. My husband doesn't mind the flavor, but I prefer the chocolate so far between the two."
1,BEWARE CONTAINS ASPARTIC ACID!,I bought this product because i was looking for a whey supplement without artificial sweeteners and a high amount of protein. When i read the label i see it contains 2508 milligrams of Aspartic Acid. Aspartic Acid is 40% of the compounds that make up Aspartame and is also a excitotoxin. Not very good for brain function at all. so beware and read your labels carefully. the canister was also open when i received it with powder all over it!
2,Half full!,"First of all I want to say I like this product, it tastes good and i love that it doesn't have any toxic junk in it like most powders. That said, there was one thing I loathed right when I opened it. It was HALF FULL, here I am looking at my big, 40$ container of protein powder, about to dive in there and slam it on some raisin bran. I open the lid, and the damn thing is half full. This isn't a one dollar bag of chips I'm buying, it's a 40$ jug. From the outside, it looks like a satisfying sized container, well worth 40$, but why even make a container that big when you're only filling it halfway? I hope they don't do this to all the jugs and mine is just a dud or an exception, because I find this rather dishonest. I'm spending good money on this stuff."
1,Junk,For $18.99 I didn't expect audiophile quality but the master speaker was dead out of the box. The slave speaker worked for a couple of minutes and then nothing but buzz. Let the buyer beware.
5,An absolute must,"Too many people think in terms of charts, bands, rsi etc....This book takes you away from technical analysis and puts you in touch with the real deal.....emotion and perception.He points out that in effect you are trading against other peoples emotions and perceptions of market behavior (fear, greed, previous beliefs) that effect both them and you....A great book! Makes you face some of your own preconceptions about life and trading. Interesting even for non traders as it presents a deep psychological review of where you have been. Get it!"
5,definitely a winner,"this book will take you on a journey through the deep and dark spaces that cause us all to stumble along .. until the light finally illuminates those dark spots and reveals to us the truth .. neither good nor bad .. just the truth .. this book can help you not only in your quest for a more effective trading mindset, but if extrapolated outwards, to the root causes of the thinking that holds us back from those things we really want in life .. take a risk and get this book .. it's really one of the best i've ever read .."
5,Starts the path to better trading and life outside trading,Reading this book will start you to look at not only yourtrading but also your life outside of trading. If you can notmaintain a peaceful life outside of trading you will nevercome to your full potential while trading.Christopher Brown (cbrown@accessone.com)
1,"Great title, but...","The message is clear, traders must have a trade plan and use it.Everybody knows the importance of stops.It is in many books.This one is a complete waste of time and money, the language is extremelly boring.I foud it very difficult to not sleep while reading it.Try Oliver Velez or Alexander Elder's books instead.Antonio Carlos R. Oyama (Duncan)"
3,Should be three chapters long,"An OK book, but very repetitive. The last chapter is the most useful. There are better books, such as Trading for a Living."
3,lcsmith,This book probably deserves a 4th star but there was nothing new. I was hoping for more. I really like this guy because I suffered the same fate. I beleive he is honest and sincere.I agree with him. If your already successful buy Market Wizzards if your not have this delivered next day air
1,Of Little Value,"This book is as far from the title as you can get. It's somewhere between Dr. Phil, an Einstein lecture and a Mensa meeting. !0% of the writings related directly to the title, the other 90% was as far way as you can get. That's where you should be from this book."
5,"Trading Psychology from a Trader, Not a Psychologist","Here, I thought, was yet another of a long list of trading psychology books on trading, hardly distinguishable from another, but after reading it, I found that I could relate and learn from these ideas on so many levels. From making the decision to continue trading even after my first big trading loss to reevaluating my trading habits and facing facts, this book has given me the most help - by far - in improving my trading. I highly recommend it. In fact, a friend of mine recently went out a day early to [an] event just to listen to Mark Douglas speak. He told me that he had the room riveted to his every work. Pretty powerful stuff."
3,A missing piece of the trading puzzle,"It is crucial that all traders master the principles presented in this book. The lessons presented in this book are 5 stars, however the writing style is 2 stars. If you can walk away with the principles this book teaches in staying with your system, do not buy or sell stocks based on your emotions, and be mentally prepared for both wins and losses then you will do well. I am sorry to say that reading this book is torture, it is about three times as long as it should be. The writers style makes the principles far to complex and clinical. The book dives far deeper into psychology than is needed to trade stocks in a disciplined manner. You would do better to read any of Alexander Elder's book on how to manage the mind while trading stocks or read the author's other book ""Trading in the Zone"" for a much lighter read. This book is just over kill on simple concepts. Also, reading the last two chapters of this book is all you really need."
2,Browse the book at the book store before you buy it,"I bought this book based on the good reviews it had received. After reading it I came away thinking that it did not meet my expectations. About 90% of the book is about psychology and your thought processes. If you are looking for controlling your emotions and responses, I would suggest reading the ""7 Habits of Highly Effective People"" by Stephen Covey. I found 7 habits much more readable and useful for the emotion/pre-conceived notion that the Disciplined Trader tries to explain.The 10% related to trading was somewhat interesting. Not a hallelujah! type of material. I suppose if you are happy getting just one good idea from a book, then you might be satisfied with it. For me, I found it less than sastifactory."
5,A Must Read Book For Traders,"This is a MUST read book for all traders - new and experienced. While trading experts might not agree on the exact percentage that a trader's psychology has on their ability to be successful, most rate it much higher than technical skills like reading charts, interpreting data, etc., etc. This book does a great job showing the reader how learning to trade involves thinking and practices that are completely different from what we have been taught to be successful at everything else in life. While it is not a fast or real especially easy read, the ideas and concepts in this book are vitally important to successful trading and I would encourage every trader to dig deep into this book sooner than later."
4,A Great Book for the Mindset,This book is a must reading for all traders. I couldnt put the book down through the first several chapters. The middle of the book becomes just a tad dry but it is still a 'must' read.The latter chapters have great information specifically for traders. This book is highly recommended not only by me but all the other professional traders out there. Dont pass this one up!
5,A Masterpiece!,"If you are losing in the markets -- buy this book. It may take you a couple times reading it to get the wealth of knowledge between the front and back cover, but it is well worth it. Douglas has succinctly put into words what all traders need to understand and make a part of their trading psyche. I can see now why it is THE industry classic."
5,Absolutely the best book on trading!,"Mr. Douglas is responsible for me getting my house out of mortgage, saving my marriage, and most of all, helping me understand the dynamics behind why I was a consistently-losing trader. I now have the skills I need to make money and keep it! I can't thank Mr. Douglas enough. I have just heard about his new book ""Trading in the Zone"" available through his website (markdouglas.com) and I can't wait to get it!"
2,So-so,"The two stars that I have given this book belong only to the last section - Part IV (more specifically chapters 15 & 16 - about 17% of the book).I have to agree with other readers of this book in that I found this book too technical and often redundant in sections.If you are looking for a good book on the psychology of trading I would highly recommend Jake Bernstein's ""The Investor's Quotient"" (2nd Ed.)."
4,Zen Capitalism?,"A previous reviewer complained that this book is all psychological, well yes it is but the subtitle ""Developing Winning Attitudes"" should be a tip off. The basic idea is that our preconceptions can force us to exclude information that we need to make informed decisions. Also our fears create a self-fufilling prophecy of loss. It's a good book, but it is ALL psychological so if you're looking for nuts and bolts look elsewhere. I couldn't give it 5 stars because it is a little verbose and repetitive in some places."
5,The Disciplined Trader: Developing Winning Attitudes,"Absolutely one of the finest books of its kind, I keep it beside me like a bible."
2,"Buy and read ""Trading in the zone"" by the same author","instead of this. Douglas had put what he learnt during the 90's (which is a whole decade from the first edition of this) in his latest book ""Trading in the zone"" and you really can tell the significant improvement between the two. Just take the best out of him and dont compromise for something less.p.s. I should have given ""the zone"" a five star instead of four. Please refer to my review of that."
2,i've read better trading books,"there are def better trading books, there was someone in particular that i wanted to read about, that's the only reason i bought it"
4,The man who woke up in tommorrow,"I really enjoyed this Niven's classic. It had a very simple story, but was filled with adventure and creativity to keep my interest. I found it much simpler to to read than some of Niven's later works, but quite a pleasurable read. I would suggest this book highly as an introduction to the writings of Larry Niven to anyone choosing to read his stories for the first time."
3,"Good book, bad publication date","I'd like to mention that the publication date given on this page is incorrect and may refer only to the Kindle version publication date. This book was published in 1976. I was about to buy the Kindle version as I'd forgotten I'd read it long ago and thought that it was a recently published book. Luckily I read the reviews which reminded me of the story line and my having read it before.Amazon, you need to be a little more accurate with the generic 'publication date' data.I thought this was an memorable read, years ago. The final disposition of the protagonist still fascinates me. I'm giving it only three stars as it's not Niven's best work. Not to say he doesn't ever get five stars; e.g., the Draco Tavern series, the Neutron Star series, and of course, Ringworld!"
1,Boring-Kept waiting for it to get interesting.,"I kept waiting for the book to get interesting and it never did. He goes into the future three million years and it just isn't anything interesting at all...I wouldn't purchase this book...All the other reviewers, I don't know what they saw in this book."
3,"Typical Niven, reworked from short story","This book is actually the first book in the ""series"" for The State.The following two books are Integral Trees and Smoke Ring, which only have to connection to this story (besides have The State as a government).First three chapters were good (Niven's short story Rammer was the 1st, yet altered a bit to fit the format). This was very interesting as it dealt with space exploration, the State and exploration of earth +3 million years. Those three chapters alone I give 5-stars. Thereafter, storyline changed... it slowed, dragged and barely held my attention. Needed more twists, which is common for Niven novels and it comes now as an expectation. I didn't fancy Ringworld for the same reasons.For better Niven reading, I suggest his short story collections of Neutron Star and Tales of Known Space. Of his novels, I recommend his novels which were in partnership with Jerry Pournelle- Mote in God's Eye, Footfall, Lucifer's Hammer and Oath of Fealty."
4,"A nice exercise on predicting the far, VERY FAR, future...","It is interesting how hard it is to conceive what the far future can hold for humankind. There are simply so many dead ends we can corner ourselves into extinction, so many ways we can evolve beyond recognition, or else we can get back to the dark ages and keep ourselves just adapting enough to barely survive the changing environment, etc...Mr. Larry Niven, goes some million years down the road, after a pit stop, some few centuries after our time, to introduce, or 'bring back to life' his main character, one of our contemporary folks, which was freezed after the disease became terminal.The exercise goes well, and the 'hero' uncovers enough clues to recognize some cycles that happened over the millenia of millenia and he has to fight for survival and... let's not spoil it...:)"
5,"Take time out for ""A World Out of Time""","I had read darn near everything Niven's written, and finally got around to this novel.I wish I'd read it sooner!Lots of action, a sense of discovery around every corner, and with every turn of the page a new puzzle to solve within the plot of the story. Of course it also has the big big science that Niven is famous for. What a treat after his less than spectacular recent efforts. If I had one bad thing to say, it's that a small portion of the science no longer holds up to current theories--but that's a small price to pay for such fun!If you're a sci-fi fan, and haven't yet read Niven, I highly recommend this book for your first read. Every bit as good as ""Ringworld"", with none of the overhead of that novel's ""Known Space"" universe to catch up on. If you're already a Niven fan, and haven't yet experienced this novel--read it now before you run out of time!"
4,A real page-turner,I first read the short story this novel is based on when I was 12. I loved it.When I was 21 I found the novel I felt it couldn't be as good - but it was better.Whilst Niven's strong point has never been dialogue or characterisation - what he does excellently is keep you interested. One plot twist follows another - whilst all the time adding more and more scientific ideas.I liked the final plot twist and I only wish I could forget it so I could read it again with genuine surprise. But my absolute favourite part is still the first chapter which is virtually word-for-word of the original short story.If you're looking for believable characters and witty dialogue - look elsewhere (sorry Larry!). But if you like a plot that keeps you guessing and a future world that's packed full of ideas - and above a story that'll entertain you - then this book is hard to beat.
1,Too complicated,"Unless you have an IT background, I found this way too complicated to set up and returned it to Amazon. It was the first time I ever did anything like that."
3,does not fit 1999 ford f350,"The factory plug is different on my truck.called hopkins and they said It probably didnt come with a tow package , and I would have to splice wires . Curt has a plug-in harness with the right plug . Bye bye hopkins!"
4,Easy install,"Easy install, only time will tell if the product holds up. I have yet to use it for more 7 point connections, just my flat plugs and it works fine for them."
4,A Story of Trauma and Loss,"This book shows the frustration created when any denomination or institution in the community of faith is either unwilling or unable to respond in a way that is sufficient to avoid a sense of re-injury instead of facilitating healing from the trauma and losses that are typically sustained in sexual and/or spiritual abuse in the community of faith. It demonstrates the problems that dual relationships create for congregants and clergy alike. Perhaps its greatest value will be in the needed raising of consciousness in regard to abuse by female clergy of another female.Dee Miller,author of (1) How Little We Knew: Collusion and Confusion with Sexual Misconduct and (2) The Truth about MalarkeySee www.takecourage.org"
4,Prime Cuts of Primal Fear,"I don't normally buy best of albums because by the time I get around to it I already have all the songs off the original albums. Without the benefit of having all their albums yet I don't know yet if I would agree the selections of songs on disc 1 are their best songs. It will be a while before I have them all. I'll probably edit this later by then. Anyway, the main reason why I bought this was for the bonus cd of classic metal songs that they covered. Primal Fear does extremely well covering other bands songs and I especially enjoyed their cover of Seek and Destroy by Metallica and Two Minutes to Midnight by Iron Maiden. I would have liked it if they had picked a different song to cover by Judas Priest, only because other bands have covered it before. I was kind of hoping they would have picked a more obscure one. Overall I liked both discs very much. If you like Primal Fear this disc won't dissapoint you."
5,A must get (If you can find it),This CD set was released in 1997 then withdrawn quickly due to legal problems with Greg Allman and others.It's a shame because it's a lovingly produced set that contains many demo's and classic songs Greg recorded during his solo career.A must get if you can find one.
5,Gregg Allman - One More Try: An Anthology,"There's no such thing as too much Gregg Allman. This 2 CD Set will not disappoint the Allman fan!! In fact, it is a must have!! The discs highlight Gregg's ability to take an audio sensation and turn it into a physical reaction. You feel the pain in the sound. I am an avid blues fan, and few, if any, elicit the response I feel when I listen to Gregg Allman. His vocal style is a window into his soul, and he's giving the listener a glimpse in. This set is a treasure with it's previously unreleased tracks and remastered tracks!"
2,Quality Of This Collection,"I will not delve into the movies themselves but rather into the quality of the three films included in this collection. ""The Ghost Goes West"" is perhaps the best print of the three leaving ""The 39 Steps"" and ""The Count Of Monte Cristo"" as rather poor renditions. They are both dark and not well presented. To say they were in anyway restored, would be to misinform. I have seen a better print of ""The Count Of Monte Cristo"" on VHS tape.Criterion did a fantastic restoration of ""The 39 Steps"" leaving this version far beneath it.This collection is only worth the asking price if you really want ""The Count Of Monte Cristo"" on DVD no matter what the quality of the print."
2,Anything to have the Count,"I agree with Claudia. ""The Count of monte Cristo"" has always been a favorite of mine. I never was able to find it on VHS and until recently, had only my copy from comercial TV. When I saw the price for this, 29.99, I was again fooled that ""If it cost more than it must be good quality."" But alas, it isn't much improved over my VHS tape. Criterion...fix this one!"
1,Robert Donat collection,The story is good but the dvd is very poor quality. It looks like all they did was get an old vhs tape and transfer it to a dvd without cleaning it up. The picture is full of lines and at times the sound does not march the picture.It is a shame because they were good movies.
4,Not the best quality DVD but amazing to have Count of Monte Cristo on DVD!!,"I have to agree with the other reviews that it is not the best quality DVD and there are no special features or scene selection options. But if you're a fan of The Count of Monte Cristo like I am, you'll be happy with having it on DVD. Side A has The Count of Monte Cristo (original length) and Side B has 39 Steps and The Ghost Goes West (which I personally don't care much for). There is also a filmography which talks about Robert Donat's life and the films he was and wasn't in. Overall, I am happy with having The Count on DVD and Robert Donat is amazing!!"
2,Terrible Colorization,"This version of the movie on VHS is not recommended for collectors. The movie is colorized, apparently by a kindergartener with crayons. Blotches of pink and orange for faces and a torch which burns with green, orange, and yellow flames are evidence that the colorizing process was done in a haphazard manner with no concern for the quality of the job. The movie itself is quite good although I personnaly prefer the Richard Chamberlain version. 2 stars for a really bad print of a good movie."
2,the robert donat collection,"the count of monte cristo has a flaw sometimes it double tracks blurie at times ,other than that the other two movies are great,all in all good bargin for the price!!"
1,The Count of Monte Christo,"MY VCR'S TITLED ""THE COUNT OF MONTE CHRISTO"" WERE RETURNED AFTERI RECEIVED A PREPAID BAR CODED RETURN SLIP. THE REASONS FOR THERETURN; 1. THE DISKS DID NOT HAVE A LABEL ON THEM SO I COULD NOTTELL WHICH SIDE WAS UP. 2. I HAD RECEIVED TWO SEPARATE ENVELOPES WHICH APPEARED TO BE DUPLICATES. THE ENVELOPES WITH THEIR CONTENTS WERE RETURNED WITH A NOTE REQUESTING EITHER A REFUND ORANOTHER COPY OF THE DVD WITH PROPER LABELING.I HAVE NOT RECEIVED ANY ANSWER."
3,Count Your Blessings,"The First sound version of "" The Count of Monte Cristo"" scores well because of its veteran cast.Donat is fine in the title role in a Muni type performance. Imprisoned with the Abby( O.P. Heggie ) Dantes gets a big start in life and thus persues his revenge on Baron Danglers et all.Louis Calhern , an under appreciated actor and Sidney Blackmer are fine in thier roles as antagonist and there is a certain 30,s sweep to the narrative that makes it a bit hokey but well done.CP"
1,Quality Seriously Lacking,"This is the only version of ""The Count of Monte Cristo"" in the 1934 version I was able to find. It's awful. And I had to use it for film class - this is one of the worst DVDs ever. Not worth the hassle or price. Only buy this product if you absolutely have to."
1,Did Not Purchase This as It was Not Available So I Got It Elsewhere,"When this product was first listed, I was excited, but then after waiting, it was listed as Discontinued by Manufacturer before it was to go on sale, so I WENT ONLIN AND GOT THESE MOVIES ON DVD - ELSEWHERE ! First time I have been disappointed with Amazon."
5,2003 Sprot Trac,These are the only plugs I would use for 01-05 Sport Trac's. Don't be lazy. Do the wires at the same time :) Keep on Trac'in
2,Doesn't perform for the whole 100k miles.,"I installed these on my 5.4 Ford Expedition at 90,000 miles back in 2006. It is now 150,000 thousand mile and I am having some drive-ability issues which is a light misfire not picked up by the computer. I traced it back to the plugs. I installed new ones and the issue is fixed. I guess this is why they only warranty for three years because they do not have the actual 100k performance they mention."
4,Perfect bathroom book,"Condensed Knowledge edited by Will Pearson definitely overloaded my brain. I don't think that this is a book meant to be read over the course of just a few sittings (or in my case, one day). There is so much info packed in here, I don't know how much I really retained, but there's superficial information about physics, biology, pop culture, music, and many other topics. The reader learns about the main movers and shakers in each subject as well as the info you need to know to sound informed about just about anything. I was a little disappointed in the writers' occasional liberal bent, especially about religion. While talking about Christianity, they can be a little flippant, and the gnostic gospels are discussed as part of the Scriptures. However, overall this is the perfect bathroom book. When you only have a few minutes to grab something to read, pick this up and learn a little something about the world."
4,who knew?,i took this book along during a 5 day hospital stay. i must say that this book and it's plethora of information kept my mind off the recovery process. lot's of interesting info....some info i found boring intitially but i read it anyway and was glad that i did. i definately would like to check out more books from the mental floss people.
4,Great Bathroom Reading,Perfect to keep in the bathroom. Short articles and interesting trivia - and long enough to last!
3,Actual readable reference book,"The folks at mental floss have a fun new book in the same style as their magazine. You will be reading from a chapter on literature, chemistry, art history, pop culture or economics and suddenly, there it is, you can't stop laughing.Fifteen chapters written by experts in their fields and all with that classic mental floss flavor. Would be a great graduation gift but keep one for yourself. Condensed Knowledge is better than an almanac, 'cause you can pick it up and begin reading at any point. It's full of facts, but it's funny too."
2,Entertaining but not entirely factual,"I'll admit this book is fun and a good bathroom read, but don't go to parties and quote passages from it to appear well-informed and intelligent. I'm not an expert on every subject the book covers but the subjects I do know are sprinkled with inaccuracies here and there. The biggest animal, the blue whale, is described as a ""vegetarian"" that eats plankton. First, some plankton are animals and not plants (or algae to be specific) and second, whales don't eat them anyway. They eat krill, which are tiny crustaceans. That's one example. Consider it a fun read, but check your facts before you try to impress that pretty girl at the bar with your vast breadth of knowledge regarding microscopic sea creatures."
3,"A+ for entertainment, B- for accuracy","I agree with all of the other reviewers that this book is fantastically entertaining. Just the title of the ""4 Things Your Boss Has in Common With Slime Mold"" section is worth the price of this book.The big disappointment is that some of the ""facts"" are flat-out wrong. A section on antibiotics claims, ""bacteria are at the root of diseases ranging from colds to tetanus,"" when colds are caused by rhinoviruses and do not respond to antibiotics. Another section claims, ""A goldfish has a memory span of three seconds,"" an urban legend which has been disproved many times over. My personal impression of the book (others will probably disagree) is that it contains a bunch of facts that the authors rattled off the tops of their heads instead of researching to any degree.So, read the book in good fun, and if you're going to use its contents to show off how smart you are, find another source to back you up first."
5,A Genuinely Fun Overview,"I love this book. From Physics to Art History to Literature, what's most impressive about Condensed Knowledge is that it's actually fun to read. It's a great mix of introductory information about various topics and hilarious anecdotes about historical figures. Just the headlines are worth the price of admission: Countries That Made Atlas Shrug; Religious Mysteries Solved by Chemistry; etc.As another reviewer said, this is the rare reference book that you can actually _read_ without your eyes glazing over. If, like me, you're never going to pull an A. J. Jacobs and read the entire Encyclopedia Britannica, Condensed Knowledge is a fun way to feel (and get!) smarter."
4,just as it says,"Just as it promises, this is a fine book to get condensed knowledge on just about anything. It also stimulates you to research further on the subjects that intrigue you. Hmmm, I might have to pass this on to my teenage son and see if it stimulates his curiousity beyond video games..."
3,Great Bathroom Literature,"When I want to read something interesting in a ""limited"" timeframe, I reach for Condensed Knowledge. Much like the magazine of the same name (""Mental Floss""), C. Knowledge consists of many page or paragraph length snippets of information on a plethora of topics. Your view of history may vary with personal politics, but there's something for everyone in this tome. Some reviewers have chimed in to point out inaccuracies. I personally didn't notice any, but wouldn't discount such a claim, as many of these facts are so random as to be unbelievable. Needless to say, I won't be going into surgery tomorrow using anything I learned reading ""Condensed Knowledge""."
2,Disappointed,"I read this entire book and it became a chore after a while. Another reviewer wrote ""Fluffy and Bland"" when describing this book. I think that is an apt description. The book reads like those ""Factoids"" in USA Today. I don't feel like I learned a whole lot by reading it."
3,"Ok, not great","I had a hard time getting through this book because, although it was entertaining enough I guess, it was mostly stuff that I had known at one time and forgotten rather than containing much that was new and fascinating. I was really hoping for some uncommon and entertaining tidbits to add to my collection of useless trivia, but was fairly disappointed."
4,good,Product is exactly what i expected. I am very satisfied with the order. I will definitely order from this company again.
3,Great.... for wide headed people,"I've been in-love with these specs for some time now and when they finally went on sale..POOF..they were mine! OK summer, I'm READY! They arrived in a substancial case with all the bells and whistles - lovely. They are heavier than my Chanels but who cares, but what I do care about is them staying on my face! They slide off. There is no way to bend, hook or otherwise keep the dang thing on. I've taken to several eye establishments with no luck. Hot beads..hot air..hot water...NOTHING WORKS! So, I'm looking hot and not looking down alot."
4,Suits just fine,"This liner fits well, matches the color of our interior, and has a sufficient lip to contain spills when they occur. The texture of the base could be a bit more ""grippy"" to reduce cargo slipping. Works fine for heavier objects but light ones tend to slide a bit. Rug anti-slip pad on top works well to make this a perfect cargo liner."
1,Dead on Arrival,"This is a beautiful looking watch which arrived DOA. It was as unmovable as Mount Rushmore. There are only three possibilities for its lack of motion.1. It was broken.2. It has no battery. I did not attempt to see if there was a battery in the watch.3. The battery was dead.I suspect that 3 is the most likely explanation for its terminal condition. Regardless, I'm sending it back for a refund. It's too bad as the watch is slim and very attractive. I own a lot of watches; this is the first that didn't run even for a second."
4,Skagen Men's Brown Leather Strap Watch,"Bought this watch via Amazon from a third party on-line seller. At first, I was a bit apprehensive, I have 100% trust in Amazon, while not being sure about other smaller sellers. But the product was shipped quickly and arrived faster than I anticipated. I would buy through rather than from Amazon again. The watch itself is really nice; simple yet elegant, thin, just a nice looking accessory. It's my second Skagen watch, it won't be my last. My only gripe is the band. The band, while apparently well-made and all, is disproportionate to the watch. It's leather and really too thick and too long."
3,Can't get a new band,"Great Watch. But the band wore out in a about 15 months, am I'm finding it impossible to find a new band. Help!! I finally ordered one on ebay that matched this model number (433LGL1), but it didn't fit and I'm having to send it back. More hassle than it's worth. I want a watch that is easy to find parts."
3,Skagen Men's Watch,This watch looks great but after 6 months of wearing the leather band separated. Replacement costs almost as much as a new watch. I haven't had the problems with the crystal cracking like others did but the watch band is a disappointment.
1,It worked... for about 2 days. No support from manufacturer,"NOTE: This is a review for the product, not the seller.I bought this product for my truck, plugged it in, got it working fine. Then after a long drive to Mammoth, I lost one channel, then lost the second... then after some giggling around, verifying cables etc, I gave up.I tried to contact the manufacturer and they never responded. I wasted 60 bucks on this thing and the lack of customer service on this product scares me from buying another one again. I opened it up and the PCB looks fine. It's pretty much a CAN bus interface and some solid state components went bad. Either the solid state stuff broke or the CAN bus controller spazzed out. I decided not to waste too much time on it and put it somewhere in my garage to get lost."
4,Works Great!,"This product works great. Especially for the price.I use it switch between a Windows Vista box and Max OS X Snow leopard. Switch from the Mac to windows takes about 5 seconds, that's mostly because of the way Windows handles USB. Switch from Windows to Mac is nearly instantaneous.Installation was automatic. No software installation required.Would recommend it to anyone."
4,Works well with Mac/PC sharing setup,I am using this switch to connect two printers and a scanner to both a Mac and a PC running Vista.Works really well. The switch time is very quick and I have not noticed any USB speed issues.I have had this setup working for a few weeks now and all seems to work well.
4,"Very easy to install and use, a little slow...",Couldn't be easier to install. I just plugged it in and it worked and continues to do so. If you require a really fast switch over you may be a little disappointed as this dude is a little slow. That doesn't matter to me so I'm happy with the thing.
5,Plug-N-Play,"Just plug it in and you can use it! Very easy on Windows XP.The only semi-negative thing is that it beeps when you turn your computer on. First time I heard it, I thought it was my motherboard telling me I had a hard drive failure."
3,Mixed feelings about this,"Although this product basically works, the lack of two USB cables in the package is just flat out obnoxious. I did happen to have another cable that I got off an old webcam that I no longer use, but I hate it when a product doesn't have everything you need to make it work out of the box.Second, on a mac the device causes a keyboard setup prompt on the computer that you switch away from. Not sure if there is a way to stop this, but it happens on every switch and obscures the monitor on the other computer with the setup window.That being said, it does work and the switch is relatively quick to take hold."
2,Good looking product but lack main feature,"I used this to share two computers to one printer.Sometimes, it won't recognize my printer, if i boot my computer before the printer. I have to reboot with the printer turn on first. This seems to be happening randomly. For a simple product, i expect it to work well all the time."
1,I dont like it...,"I got this to hook a hub to it and share my usb devices between two pc's. That didnt work, I thought it was the hub at first and tried a different hub, nope. Also you cant hook a thumbdrive to this either, gives nothing but erros. Was able to share a printer but I wanted to share all my devices. I give this device 1 star."
1,Junk,"I bought the device to switch between a PC and Mac with the same mouse and keyboard; a very simple setup. It worked for about 20 minutes, then stopped working completely."
2,Package do not include USB cables to connect,Package do not include USB cables to connect. End up spending lot of time and money searching for the right cable. Then it did not include any CD or driver to make it work. Went to the manufacturers website to get the driver then it worked. Worked only for Windows XP. Does not work on Windows 7.
3,Great little switch but has issues,I use this daily and I love it. I have both a laptop dock for my work laptop and my own personal PC hooked up. I switch between the 2 multiple times a day and this makes it so quick and easy! No more unhooking from one to connect to the other.However! There is a huge downside. This little switch will prevent some PCs from properly sleeping including mine.
5,printer switch,I love this little gizmo. We were unplugging and plugging the printer from one computer to the other and it made it so we could just push the button quickly to switch which computer was connected to the printer and was small and fit on the desk.
2,Book review,I thought the book was very through as all the books in the series are however I thought there was an obvious slant to the left in the text. The assessment that the white people were brainwashed conformist who excluded all that was different was a little disturbing to me. There was a tremendous amount of economic grow and prosperity due to the free market and capatalism. Brainwashed conformists could not have done such great things.
3,Microsoft Sidewinder Force Feedback Wheel Review,"I would have wanted to know details about the product-there was no product information, there was no installation CD, no instructions. Even though the box that it was mailed in was badly damaged, the product was in good condition; however it was incompatible with Windows Vista and was probably meant for PS3. Can I return or send it back?Microsoft Sidewinder Force Feedback Wheel"
4,What you would expect for the price,"These don't sound nearly as clean as the Altec Lansing ACS50's I used to have on the computer, let alone the 3-piece Altec set I have in the office. However, since this is just for the kids to play games, it does the job and the price is right. I don't want the kids going deaf!"
2,Really not that good,"I was listening to KMFDM about 11 years ago and was a very big fan of theirs until the MDFMK/Attak era. There are some decent songs on here but it's really nothing special. Nothing new or exciting. In fact, I'm inclined to say this is total garbage when compared to Nihil or Xtort, which were both fantastic albums. And umm... can you really say they're based in Germany when the German fellows left (or whatever) and the ""Kaptin"" seems to have a Russian name? Anyway, if you are thinking about buying this as your first KMFDM album (which i doubt since they're just milking old fans for money and not bringing many new ones on at this point) don't. Buy some GOOD KMFDM like Nihil, Xtort, Money, Angst or ""Symbols"" instead to see what KMFDM really was, and should be."
3,Good but not Great,"There's a couple good songs on this. It's true that Pig's band is here sans the most important member, Raymond Watts himself. The song writing could be a bit better in some places, others it's awesome. If you're a KMFDM fan, it's a great buy. If you're just getting in to them, I reccomend Symbols or Nihil over this. Then head this way."
3,A decidedly mixed bag,"Opiniationed Disclaimer: The only KMFDM album I had owned previously was _Nihil_ which I'm using as my gold-standard of KMFDM music. That said, ""Free Your Hate"" and ""Real Thing"" are 5-star songs. Many of the rest of the tracks are solid, 4-star tracks with phenominal production values that have a (random) not-perfect element in them -- these include ""Hau Ruck"", ""New American Century"", ""Feed Our Fame"", ""Ready to Blow"" and ""Professional Killer"". ""Mini Mini Mini"" and ""Auf Wiederseh'n"" are 3-star tracks that don't do much (but I admit I don't speak German). The other two tracks -- ""You're No Good"" and ""Every Day's a Good Day"" -- just aren't good at all being mis-written and/or mis-arranged. I would have liked to have given the album 4 stars, but I can't really recommend buying the full album when I'm only regularly listening to maybe half of it."
3,Lucia or KMFDM?,"It's got some good songs...unfortunately it wasn't the surprise I was hoping for. Did KMFDM decide to change their name to Lucia? Because it seems like every song is sung by her now. Fortunately she's good enough to make the album worth it, but it's still not as good as I hoped.As a side note: For those who haven't noticed, KMFDM is not producing the same type of music they were. If you didn't like their last few albums you probably won't like this one. My rating is based on the quality of music released in this album, in relation to the recent albums that have this ""new sound"".If you like their current music, you will find a few songs that you will enjoy (not a whole lot). If you don't like their current music, why are you even looking at this?"
4,very disappointing,"I find myself liking every track on this cd and that is a hard thing to find on a cd these days. The songs are filled with heavy guitars, catchy beats and good lyrics whether humorous or political. My favorite songs would have to be Hau Ruck, Free Your Hate and Auf Wiederseh'n. Mini Mini MIni is a song song in french which I didn't care for because french is a wussy language but the music greatly made up for that. Hau Ruck, Auf Wiederseh'n and the intro to Every Day's a Good Day are in german which I thought gave those songs a nice touch. Real Thing is a good song to listen to even though I usually don't like to hear Lucia sing alone. I had expected to get annoyed with her on so many songs but I instead enjoyed her singing on the songs."
5,Welcome back KMFDM,"I'm Glad to see KMFDM back and rocking again. I had almost given up on them after their last three or four albums which were definately sub-par by KMFDM's standards. But I honestly think this is their best album since the 'symbols' album from ten years ago. I'm serious. KMFDM fans, what do you think? Agree/disagree? On 'Hau Ruck' it seems as if KMFDM has revived some of that ultra heavy beat from the early to mid nineties that was sorely missed.Although most of the band is different (Sascha K. still there of course) it seems as if there is some talent in their new lineup. Lucia especially has a sexy voice IMO. After the WWIII album, which was not particularly great by KMFDM standards, left me and many other fans unsure of KMFDM's future. But this album I will proudly say is much better."
1,Too much POP for my liking ...,"This album has a very mainstream sound to it. When they released Adios, it should have been the final album. Sadly, KMFDM keeps goin' on and will soon sound like Linkin Park."
5,"""Ladies and Gentlemen...Hau Ruck""",Going into this album I didnt know what to expect. Some of the key players are gone and I really thought this album would suffer because of it. What a shock I got when I heard the CD. This is the best KMFDM album in years. The sound is really great. Its like the took Angst and mixed it in with Symbols to create this really guitar heavy album with a dancable electronic vibe. Just what I wanted to hear from them. Some of the standout tracks....Free Your Hate...Hau Ruck...Mini Mini Mini...Professional Killer.The Ultra Heavy Beat Continues....
4,Good for out doors,"I never worry about electric shock with this pwer strip.Even if it gets wet, no worries. The only thing that worried me was having to wash my hands after touching it.The instructions said I could get lead poisoning by just touching it! Yikes!"
4,The Rise of a New Dawning,"This continues where the last story left off. Not going to give anything away, you have to listen and follow along for yourself. This is one of the best symphonic metal bands I've ever heard. Once again, we have a great story and a great cover artwork. The only thing that I don't like about this cd is the singer. They replaced the first one and then they got one that sounded just like him. That doesn't make very much sense to me, but it works for them. I can't wait to hear and read the 3rd installment of this story. Evil has shown itself and good is fighting. The stones are....well, check it out for yourself, you don't be disappointed. I'm not and I just purchased this cd."
2,SOOOOO WHACK,NOW I HAVE OVER 300 BOOKS I LOVE BOOKS TO DEATH THIS WAS A WASTE OF MY MONEY SOOOOOO BORING OMFG .................................
1,The Product of a Narrow Heart,"She talks a great line, but seems oblivious to Divine Mercy's infinite ways...she's more to be pitied than censured, though I'm sure she will think Satan speaks through me. Soit!This book did not give me hope. It gave me the willies.One prays for her and her kind."
5,There is hope!,"This was a wonderfully written book. The book explains end times in terms we can all understand. It gives all of us expectations of a greater life beyond this one and hope for our eternal life. For those who are mystified from reading Revelations, you will enjoy this read. It helps explain some of the symbolism and numbers our human minds find puzzling and beyond reach."
3,Glam staging dilutes charm,"The chilly, Las Vegas style of this production suggests satire, but Massenet's honeyed score doesn't. This endearing opera could really bloom in a sincere staging. Michelle Breedt portrays believable impetuousness in the title role depite the antic scene, singing with suavity and fresh, lovely tone. Patrizia Ciofi as the glamorous Ensoleillad enchants us with gorgeous voice, technical mastery, and stirring lyricism. Carmela Remigio as the innocent Nina sings and acts sweetly. The other soloists, chorus and orchestra perform expertly under Emmanuel Villaume."
5,Bueno Pedal.Excelente,"Buene Pedal Excelente.Lo Recomiendo al vendedor,LLEGO JUSTO A TIEMPO SIN COMPLICACIONES PREVIAS.LO RECOMIENDO ESTE PEDAL MUY BUENA GAMMA. Lo califico excelente"
4,Good value for the price,"This is a capable pedal with many immediately useable patches. I have not spent much time customing the patches but there seems to be enough capability in this unit to improve and adjust to your taste. Considering the relatively low price/performance ratio, this feature-rich decent quality pedal is a great buy for the musician hobbiest."
5,Awesome bass effects pedal box!!!!!,"Great effects box!!!! All you need is to buy this effects box by Zoom. Some reviewer mention that many of the effects are novelty, you won't end up using in a recording or live situation. I disagree with that especially if I want to stretch my creative muscle and write music, I could easily see myself using most of these effects when recording or playing. Especially if I am going to write eclectic/eccentric music there is something for everyone in this effects box. I listen to a lot of different kinds of music. These effects open a whole new door of creativity for me. I don't see the need to buy another effects box.Pros - very compact, light weight, built-in drum beats so I can jam, highly configurable (create your own patches)Cons - if you want to customize the drum beats then it's not for you. Hey but if I just want to jam and come up with ideas then it suffices."
4,Its worth the money.,This is a good effects pedal for $69. Good preset patches for distortion and even for funk. I like the bass amp models best. You can find a sound for most songs with this pedal.
3,"Could have been good, but I had to return it...","The product was quite good the few times I tried it. I had a little problem trying to get it work -- the inverted display was a little painful, and I did try to make it happen, but it was simply too confusing."
4,Good collection of stories,"I admittedly am actually biased on this one, my cousin is in this movie, so I probably would not have gotten it if he was not in it. That being said, after I received it, I popped it in and watched it. Now... I am a gay man that is 28 years old... and this movie really hits it home. Every gay man, young or old should see this collection of stories. Honestly, if everyone saw these there may be less hate crimes in schools."
2,decent speakers,"these are decent, but the tweeters are not nearly strong enough. first of all, they arent very loud or crisp, and they blow out at 40rms easily. i fried both my fronts... and instead of replacing with the same ones, i bought a pair of polk momo's 2-way coaxials. after i tried the polks, i unhooked the two working hifonics speakers in the back. the polks absolutely, completely, in a grand fashion, blow the hifonics speakers out of the water. not only can you pump 60wRMS and more into the polk's, the tweeters in the polks are just incredible for the price. i have damn near TRIED to blow out the tweets, they just get louder. needless to say, the hifonics are worth about twenty bukks, so if you get them for that then theyre fine.honestly, i was worried when i noticed these hifonics have ""led lights"" in them... and my worries were spot on. i think any speaker that puts out light leaves a little left to be desired in its audio output."
3,A little tin - ee,"These speakers were priced right, but I had assumed that they would be of hgiher sound quality than they ended up being. They don't handle the bass levels very well (and I don't mean listening to rap kind of levels). I listen to mainly rock n roll, and they can start to distort if you don't play with the level.Not bad for the price, but the regular price would have suggested that they were a better speaker (I've just recently removed the ""SUCKER"" sign from my forehead)."
5,Adorable pictures,"My sons LOVED this book when they were little. They could not get enough of the cute pictures of stuffed animals all cuddled together in the book. It is great for even infants, as it grabs their attention."
3,Really Old Time Music,"In my opinion, this music was really old. I was expecting that the CD would be, technologically, updated in some way. But, it wasn't. Also, I only enjoyed one song on this CD and that was Singer Peggy Lee's ""All Of Me"". Am I sorry that I purchased this CD? My answer is YES. But, that one song that I enjoyed compensates for purchasing this item."
5,Amazing Menopausal Relief,"I started taking this medication last summer on the advice of a close friend. It took a few weeks totake its full effect, but I feel much better by taking it, in the morning with my breakfast. It reallygets rid of that shaky feeling all the time. (THE JITTERS)!!! Soy Balance really helps with your overallhormonal balance. I love it-I will continue taking it until I feel I no longer need it. I highly recommendit to anyone facing menopause issues."
4,Sure does help!,"Have been using this product for almost six months - and it definitely helps - doesn't make everything disappear, but drastically reduces the hot flashes. Also, Amazon is the least expensive place to buy it!"
4,Concise nitty-gritty for dental students,"This book has proved to be quite valuable for me going through dental school. It is organized in a way that makes finding info very quick, and also is easy to read through the basics. Obviously, it is not a comprehensive review of any subject, and you SHOULD go to your primary texts. Also no oral path. But, it is a great book to just carry around in your early stages of your career. As a current 4th year, I find that I know most of the information it has, but it was very useful for 1+ years."
2,Trying too hard...,The production is too polished here making the album sound more 'metal' but the songs are too redundant and generic. Sounds like Slayer at an all time low. Not much melodic swede-metal riffs here that make it an Entombed album. Starjvind's drumming is straight forward but rather uninteresting which is in my book rather dissappointing; lots of double but nothing much else. Buy THE HAUNTED 'ONE KILL WONDER' instead. That album is what Morning Star should have been.
4,Completely Original,I love this album it is like some where between Sabbath and death metal. I myself am a huge fan of the Death and Roll style that emtombed have created. I am also a fan of the old school death metal sound of the early entombed albums and think most of the fans of that era entombed are to hard on entombed for progressing beyond there earlier work. I sorry that there not Cannibal Corpse or Some other tire ass Death Metal band making the same album 15 times. In the case of Entombed musical growth is a good thing
2,If your toddler is the Prince of Wales,"This cover of this book is very deceiving. There are literally only 6 pages of advice on a fussy eater which is common sense information. The recipes in the book are gourmet! It takes major preparation to make these recipes. I don't even cook that way for myself or my husband! The ideas of presentation are fun, but be prepared to buy some unusual ingredients. I would suggest buying a bunch of fun shaped cookie cutters and allowing your creativity to flow!"
3,not his best,"the only reason i give this dvd 3 stars is because the band is spot on and it is gregory live. however, jet star should be ashamed for putting this show on dvd. gregory is clearly not well and his voice is horrible. the show lasted 40 minutes and the audience is clearly disappointed when gregory has to leave the stage earlier than anticipated. i felt sorry for gregory and the audience just watching it. the band looks confused as well. jet star shame on you."
5,Do not compare this novel with The Red Tent,"This beautiful novel is written with sensitivity and the author has a distinct way of capturing human emotion and feelings. I can almost feel the cold and the heat, smell the flowers and feel the pain and loneliness of the characters. This book can take one back to a time and place in their own lives, one locked in memory, but forever changed.The novel is quite unique from The Red Tent. The mark of a good author is one that can write without shadows of their previous works. I have become a fan of Ms. Diamant and cannot wait to read more of her books. What a storyteller!"
5,GREAT Story...,"This was my first Anita Diamant book, and I absolutely loved it. I loved the flow of the story, and the diversity of the characters, and how many of them looked after one another, knowing that everyone else was against them.Upon finishing this book, I googled Dogtown, Ma, and saw that it's only 2 hours from my house...so I'm in the process of trying to convince my husband to take a trip up there with me so I can see the now deserted little ghost town, along with Gloucester. While Dogtown was an actual town, gossiped to be inhabited by witches and prostitutes, this is a fiction book, based very loosely on what's know to be it's last days.If you like somewhat historic novels with eccentric and down-on-their-luck characters, then you'll love this book. It opens in 1814 with the death of Abraham Wharf, and follows the dwindling residents of Dogtown for the next 30 or so years. While this was my first book from Ms. Diamant, it most definitely will not be my last. I highly recommend this :)"
2,Not nearly engaging enough,"I was very impressed with The Red Tent. I loved the way the characters and their interactions were developed throughout the story. Although not a lengthy book, the author achieved real depth quickly and easily with her narrative. The Last Days of Dogtown simply did not have the same depth. The story seemed very disjointed; there is no real beginning and no definitive end. Although some of the vinettes of the various characters were interesting, the compilation of the whole was somewhat pointless. I love to read because I feel like I always learn something from whatever I read. Fiction in particular is either informative or evokes some type of reaction or emotion. In all honesty, this book was uninteresting."
3,Depressing Character Study,"I'm still trying to form a solid opinion about this one. Of course, I bought it because of Red Tent, which I loved. This story centers on a dying town and it's inhabitants, who have no future to speak of, other than the youngsters, who got out. Each chapter spotlights a character and you get a brief history about the what and why of their state of mind. I felt these residents lives had been wasted, with the exception of Easter who was the only light in a dark place. No plot, just characters and situations."
5,Diamant is a Diamond writer,"As always, Anita expresses in clear detail one story weaving a tribe together. She's amazing. I lovedThe Red Tent as well."
1,"I Wanted to Love it, But Didn't","I really enjoyed ""The Red Tent"" and I wanted to love ""Dogtown"" as much as ""The Red Tent,"" but unfortunately, I did not. I found this book to be dry and hard to get into. Reading became a chore. I wasn't particularly fond of any of the characters and didn't feel connected to them. Overall, the story just wasn't that compelling."
3,Disappointing read,"I wanted to love this-- once lived next to Dogtown in Gloucester, the author is local and well liked-- but I think the Wash. Post review above was perceptive in declaring it ""an overlay of a modern sensibility on an imagined past"". The many colorful characters are not rendered fully dimensional in my mind, riding between a tendency toward caricature and a too-contemporary outlook. The material is well-researched, yet the prose reads a bit flat-footed; were the imagery more colorful and creative, I'd be more drawn in. Still, I think Diamant is on the edge of better things, a writer to keep an eye on."
2,Better Days for Ms. Anita????,"Although an interesting story, of a real place in history, not many ""real"" details were explored. After reading the ""Red Tent"" by this author, I was extremely disappointed in this work. I read it all, and was left with wanting more. Please come back, Ms. Anita, into the history digging writer, I know is there somewhere!!"
3,OK but not great.,"This book was OK, but not as great as I expected from the reviews. It doesn't really have much of a plot but is more a peek into the lives of the town's inhabitants."
2,Wish I'd gone to the library,"I just finished the book, and have mixed feelings about it. On its own The Last Days of Dogtown succeeds as a sensitive character study, evoking much feeling and atmosphere; alongside The Red Tent however, (Diamant's previous best-seller) this novel pales in comparison.I know I shouldn't compare this book to one of the author's previous works--The Red Tent--since they are intended to be different. However, I can't help but be disappointed in The Last Days Of Dogtown when I remember how much I loved The Red Tent. While the latter contains so much depth, so many layers, The Last Days of Dogtown is quite shallow and ultimately unsatisfying. I can't help but feel that with more research and more substance this book could have been great instead of average.Perhaps I'll feel differently reading it again at a later date."
1,grisly reading,This book leaves you with a pretty grisly outlook on life. Not my cup of tea. the best of all her books is The Red Tent. fabulous book.
3,Short on a feel for Cape Ann,"Anita Diamant is a good writer, but her works set in the Gloucester, MA area just don't resonate with a true sense of place. ""The Red Tent"" is worthy of all the great things said about it, but ""Good Harbor"" and ""The Last Days of Dogtown"" just don't leave me with a deep sense this author truly understands the community. These last two novels are servicable, craftwise, but I was hoping for more. I've spent over thirty years on Cape Ann ... there's a large arts community there, but one lacking a voice that challenges, that shows the community in a new way. There's too much provincialism and conformity in the Gloucester arts community and I thought that Diamant, as a semi-outsider, might have brought a fresh look on the community. Perhaps those of us who want that will just have to wait for the publication of Novus I. Bickerstaff's ""From Duncan Hill."" The rumblings about that novel indicate Gloucester, and all of the North Shore, will never be the same."
2,Not good enough for my 115 year old bookclub,"Diamant disappointed me with this one. The historical background was OK but no depth to the history of a rich historical area.( I have lived in nearby Marblehead). The individual chapter plots lukewarm, the initial language uneccesary - failed to be attention forming. I left it at the library as a gift this morning. Now I have to find another book for bookclub for 2006I loaned it to another bookclub member to review it (she also is a reviewer for our town library). She agreed - no equal to the RED TENT. V. Daring(not a child's review)"
4,Great Historical Read,"When I saw a book that I had not read by author, Anita Diamant, I had to read it as soon as possible. I'm not certain why I never saw this book back when it was originally published, but I noticed it while searching for books on my Kindle.The Last Days of Dogtown takes the reader into the lives of many different characters in a small New England town. This little town is made up of misfits and outcasts. Most of the stories are sad because what brought the people to Dogtown was usually dire circumstances. Of course there are dogs in the story and their story is intermingled with the humans of the book. Two dogs, Greyling and Tan, will break your heart with their steadfast companionship offered to lonely people in Dogtown. Anita Diamant did not disappoint this reader and she remains on of my favorite authors."
4,Easy Read,"This is a easy book to read. The characters are interesting. Overall its a good book, but not a great book."
3,"doesn't compete with ""red tent""","after reading the red tent, I guess my expectations were another captivating novel that pulls you in and put you there. It was't bad, but not the read I would have liked."
2,The Last Days of Dogtown should be put in a hole with bones,"Our book club picked this one, not as good as The Red Tent. Too many characters to get connected to. I finished the book felt bad for most of the characters, but felt it was on the dry side."
1,Filthy and pornographic,"I picked this up this book on CD for $3.97 at Goodwill. I got robbed. This book isn't worth a penny. What was wrong with this book? Where to start...what wasn't wrong?I am no prude AT ALL. But I found this book to be pornographic to the point that it made my skin crawl. And since it was a book on CD, I couldn't skim the crude and vile sexual descriptions in the book. I had to just sit there and listen to every gag reflex invoking word. I finally chose to just stop listening to the book. I didn't get through more than a few CD's.Another problem was that the characters are not in the least believable. They are all cardboard cutout characters with one-dimensional personalities.This book is no more or less well written than any typical harlequin romance novel. If that is your type of reading material, well, damn, somewhere in the world a worthwhile human being is starving to death in a third world country and you aren't. Almost makes you wonder if there is a God."
4,quick intro (as advertised),"Well written and easy to understand. In an hour or 2, you can get a quick grasp on this subject. Considering the cost of textbooks nowadays this is sort of a good place to start if you are in a logistic regression class."
3,Good Content,"As of the writing of this review, the publisher does not allow you to view the Table of Contents on amazon.com.So, I thought I'd help fellow readers by sharing some of the things found in this book (from the distributor International Wealth Success, Inc.):* Sample purchase agreements* Ways to value a business* Procedures for making an offer* Financing methods* No money down payment strategies* Negotiating techniques* Handling objections* Closing steps* Legal considerations* Accounting* Understanding P&L; statements--Michael--"
2,Mr Previn lacks feeling for the works.,I have many if not nearly all the recordings of both works and all I can say is here both sound like a perfectly correct and unfeeling run through. The four sea interludes sound as if no one involved had ever gone to a sea coast. Look elsewhere if you want to feel the sea or any emotions.
4,History - One Person at a Time,"Growing up in the 70's, it is hard to understand the dramatic societal changes that took place in the 60's. This book takes you right back to that time through a series of interviews, given 10 years after high school, with students from the ""golden era"" class of '65. These interviews are frank discussions of politics, drugs, sex, spiritual journeys and relationships, as well as reminiscences of that bizarre time in our lives we call the high school years. These students are from very wealthy families and are not a cross section of their generation, but this book provides a unique view of what it was like to be on the cutting edge of major shifts in societal views."
3,Good book...,"When I read the book years ago it was a very good read but I also recall that it was a tv series in the late '70s,Does anyone else remember that show ? I tried looking for it on YouTube but no luck."
3,Revision,"I gushed about this album when I first got it but, after a decent number of listens, I've come to find I just don't like it very much. It turns out that the only good songs are ""You Can Have It All,"" ""Cherry Chapstick,"" and ""Night Falls on Hoboken."" Hey Ira, get back on the guitar for the next one, man."
4,And Then Nothing Turned Itself Inside-Out,The music....Ahhhhhh....just like a gentle breeze by the ocean side! I love it! There's something so innocence yet yearning for that of a wonderous perfection in this music. It is indeed one of the best albums.
3,SSSSSHHHHH! BAND PLAYING,"I've liked Yola Tengo for years but they are not for everyone. This recording may not even be for their past fans. The music is as simplistic as simple can be. The band plays every song as if they are afraid to wake the neighbors. You'll need more than one listen and an open mind to get through this repeated times. The songs by Georgia Hubley tend to be the best crafted. Her voice is consistent and restrained. The melodies seemed designed for late night reflection. Even the drums are lightly brushed as opposed to beaten. No one breaks a sweat here yet you should like ""Madeline"" which has a soft hook to it and ""Tears Are In Your Eyes"" which is actually enchanting. Repeated listens hold up for such beautiful songs but you will have to show patience and increase your caffeine intake to get through the whole recording."
1,Completely anonymous,"If possible, this record contains even less energy and personality than the previous YLT CD's combined. Not a single song stands out or stays in your head any longer than it takes to play the CD. You've heard this all before, somewhere else, from bands that did it better.The eternal question with Yo La Tengo is: How many times can you rewrite the Velvets' ""I'm Sticking With You?"" The answer: As many times as your record company (and your fans) let you get away with.I tried. I gave Yo La Tengo four CD's worth of my money, and out of those four CD's I only kept one. This is the one that hit Ebay first. Draw your own conclusions."
1,Oranj utanj thrips,"Why only 1:5? Because ""lies, damn lies, and statistics"". Hint: always lie to your friendly neighbourhood statistician. Dayng robots cayn't tell difference tween truth and laahs anywhichway but looooose. Man, YLT have certainly hit their straps here. It takes me far out and far away. I very much enjoy the auditorium space and the time they have allowed for their glowing pieces of composition. If you like it slow and spacious and gentle and beautiful and insightful and loving and rock and cranked and avante garde and melodic and harmonic, and a chocola'-block-full-o' 74 minutes of bits and bytes, then splurge off. You could certainly do a very Hell of a lot worse, for instance any thing by either Phil Collins, Billy Joel or Elton John. In the immortal words of the great Wizard of Id, ""scrippin' in the jippin' and scrappin' in the fratz!"""
2,a little disappointing...,"I admit, after hearing 'From A Motel 6' (on the Painful album)and 'Madeline' from this one, I was seriously anticipating getting aCD from this band. Needless to say, since I was somewhat unfamiliar with this band (...)..I hoped that this was not one of those bands where that 'one' song would be the best one on the CD. Well unfortunately, it was.However, I do not think that this band does not have promise. They do. I have a sense that with this band when they are hot..Ouch! when they are cold..Brrr! I would also like to say that it is quite possible that Yo La Tengo is the type of band where one album wouldn't agree with you and that another one of their's would. Hit or Miss. Geez, they have like eleven to chose from anyways, right?So if I ever find myself with (enough money) again (She says with ""bunny-ears"" from her pockets), then I will take another chance on this group. Possibly with 'Painful' because it seems to have a sort of direction and mood that this album lacks."
5,Pure and serene,From humble roots and courteous pastures the harmony permeates through. And the melancholy essence produced and the austere melody augmented from the breach. All humbly ethereal and ornate. The mode to placate all.
4,A Peek at Dave Pike,"A solid,well balanced album by vibist Dave Pike,whose scatting tends to compete with some of his best licks.Pike comes out punching with his composition,'Why Not' and is accompanied by Herbie Lewis(b),Walter Perkins(d)and Bill Evans(p)-not long after the Riverside Village Vanguard Session's and Scott Lafaro's death;for anyone who thinks Evans lacks swing,dig him on this."
2,Specious arguments and omitted ones,"I must agree with the Nashville reviewer. I'm constantly floored by the reference (only ocasional, which itself raises questions) to ""legacy"" preferences. These are wrong, wrong, wrong. (If anything, an applicant with parents who attended that university -- especially a prestigious private one -- should be held to a *higher* standard. They'd damn well *better* do well, given their myriad advantages in life.)Overall, not a terribly convincing book, and I did try to read it in the spirit of being convinced."
2,ugh,"Ive had this pedal for less than a week and have already had problems with it. The knobs come off extremely easily. Its also hard to get the stinkin thing open. Also, the sound is horible. It sounds no diferent than an amps overdrive. If you really need a pedal, or enjoy overdrive, get it. Otherwise i dont recomend it at all. Spend a little more and get a Digitech metal master."
2,No Band of Brothers,I haven't seen any of these in a long time. Boy are they dated. After Pvt. Ryan and Band of Brothers the action here seems very slow and unrealistic. It was nice to see Lee Marvin in a episode I had never seen.
5,I have this doll and it is soooooooo fun!!!!,"I just got this doll today my mom got it for me as a suprise after dance classes and shes sooooooooooooooo fun and pretty she comes with:A 1 white visor3 tennis balls in a canister1 tennis racket with the Bratz ""B"" logo on it1 sticker card1 white star brushand a tennis bag.She is sooooooo fun u gotta get her to love her."
4,Huge Tony Joe Fan,"Although this video isn't as ""funky"" as the Austin City Limits DVD, I thought Tony Joe's guitar playing was unbelievable! He definately was a forerunner to the ""Dire Straits"" sound of double note fingerpicking, and you can see him deftly alternate between using the pick, cup the pick, and then fingerpick, all in one motion. I felt he rushed thru ""Polk Salad Annie"", but I think he sometimes may get tired of playing that, but his audience expects it, and I think he wanted to, in a way, get it over with and play some more intracate guitar songs. Just my opinion. Well worth the money tho'."
2,A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED,"I'M A BIG TONY JOE FAN, BUT I DIDN'T THINK THIS WAS THE BEST HE COULD DO. TONY JOE TO ME, IS EITHER REALLY GOOD OR MUCH LESS THAN REALLY GOOD, BUT NEVER BAD. SO I DON'T WANT TO DISCOURAGE OTHERS WHO MIGHT LIKE THIS BETTER THAN ME."
5,Excellent,Rainy Night in Georgia is one of my favorite songs and Tony Joe does it beautifully. All the songs are great. What a talented guy! The production of the video is very good. Get it!
4,Not bad,The watch is great for monitoring your heart rate and planning a basic cardio work out for you to follow. I was a little disappointed at its weight training capabilities. It only allows you to complete a full weight training workout once a week then your on your own for the rest of the week. Its also a little limited in the exercises you can do and you can't add any of your own into the mix. I also don't know if I'm missing something but I haven't completely figured out how to read the data analysis it does with the software. I think if I could figure out the software or if the software was more friendly I would have given it 5 stars. Overall not a bad choice especially for the cost.
5,Best Biochemistry Book Ever,"I used this book for all four years of biochemistry classes while getting my B. S. in biochemistry. This book was my main reference in classes which suggested other texts. It saved me thousands of dollars because I never had to buy another book on the subject. I still use it two years later as a reference in my lab. In addition, it has been incredibly helpful while making my way through my Master's. I can't think of a subject that it leaves untouched. It is a relatively easy read and it's very logically laid out."
2,Frightful!,"I struggled through my first two semesters of biochemistry with this book. It is absolutely terrible. The language is contorted and overly confusing. Relatively unimportant concepts are explained in excruciating detail while important things (like the PDH compex) are given short shrift.Fortunately I discovered Lehninger before the end of my second semester, and after reading it everything became much more clear. My advice if this book is required for your course: buy Lehninger and photocopy the G&G; problem sets from a friend if you have to. It is a superior text and it's cheaper."
5,Great Bio-Chem Book,This book is very detailed and covers a wide range of bio-chemistry information.
3,Nikolai's Fortune,"This is a harsh tale about a harsh land, in a difficult time. The heroines are interesting, but their lives are dismal. One wants a little hopefulness. Torvig stretches credibility with multiple pregnancies, rapes, and women who adandon their children while hoping for a better life for them. The men are hapless, drunkards, or die early deaths. The historical and political information is valuable and well-researched, but the story is told in a tone of bitterness that overrides what could be a fine tale."
5,High-End Quality and Performance,"The speaker arrived so well packaged you might think it was a shipment of precious jewels - right down to the velvet drawstring bag it was finally contained in. On close up inspection, this thing reeked quality, and the piano black finish was flawless. They even included a pair of special gloves and cleaning cloth to look after that beautiful finish, along with excellent documentation. I placed the speaker on a Sanus Systems steel stand also purchased from Amazon, and it's a perfect match. I finished running the speaker in with music at a medium volume, and have sat and done some critical listening...I am very happy with the performance, and it's nice to find American products with this level of quality and value. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"
5,A lovely read,I like books that have an artistic flavor and this author is definitely an artist in her writings. Her work is beautiful.
5,New and improved!,This is a very good potato masher. I wanted one like my grandma's that would stand up to the dishwasher. This has the same shape and principal of mashing and it it dishwasher safe. I am very pleased with the masher and the service. Excellent.
3,Pretty to look at but...,"I received this book as a present and was delighted at the prospects of cooking from it after reading through it.Sadly, after trying several recipes, they all lacked any real flavor. The recipes were easy to follow and ingredients easy to come by, they just didn't add up to much.I'm going to give a few other recipes a try and hope they'll change my mind about this cookbook."
4,Healthy - who cares?,Here is a short and easy-to-understand review. This may be a book of Healthy Latin recipes. Who knew healthy could be this good? Don't let the Healthy part put you off. Buy it and cook from it and enjoy it.
2,Meh,"I was really excited for this book. I thought it would have new and innovative recipes and techniques. I think anyone with basic cooking knowledge could make the recipe changes this author made. ""use low-fat tortillas"" or ""reduced-fat cheese"". I prefer to eat food as minimally processed as possible and substituting chemically changed foods to reduce fat and calories is just not something I am interested in."
2,Steven Raichlen's Healthy Latin Cooking,"Dissappointing for content; had especially wanted receipe for Feijoada and was referenced, but not provided in cookbook."
2,not to interesting,I didnt really like the book. Some of the reciepes had extra and unnessary ingrediants. Not many pictures. I would look to have seen more pics and easier instructions.
5,Beautiful,I purchased this item to give to my Mother-In-Law on Christmas. She had tears in her eyes as she read it. It is absolutely beautiful and touching!
2,Parts missing,The parts bag was missing 11 nuts and bolts. Going to have to go to a hardware store and buy more so I can put the wheels on the cart! Disappointing for sure!
5,Great Book,If you are in business or want to be in business this is a great book to read. It applies to everyone so do not be turned away because the business is a chicken franchise. In fact it should be read by everyone even if you are not in business because it can really change your way of thinking for the positive. S. Truett Cathy is an amazing man with excellent morals and convictions. In the book you will see the tough times he went through and see how he dealt with them. I have recommended this book to so many people. I have a lot of respect for S. Truett Cathy
1,NOT IN STOCK,"I have not received the item just yet so I can not comment on the item itself, but just as a warning to all who thinks this is a great deal. I ordered this set in the beginning of November of 2004 and it is now mid-February 2005 and Amazon has been delaying this for the third time now. They say it will be the end of April before I will receive it. I should cancel, but I'm in no hurry. Like I said, just a warning if you are thinking about this as a gift or any other occation where you need it soon, I suggest looking elsewhere.** UPDATE **I received my order and the set is gorgeous, perfect for any occassion! Definately worth the wait!"
2,Never in Stock,"I, too, have the same complaints as the others, I ordered this item in June, it is now October, and I have yet to receive it. In June, I was in no great hurry, but now with the holidays approaching, I would very much like to use my dishes!!! This is totally unacceptable and I'm thinking about cancelling."
4,Nice but can't use them in the microwave.,"I love my plates, but they have metal in the plates so they can't be used in the microwave."
1,Not Happy,"I am in CA and ordered 2 of these sets for my family on the east coast. They are very unhappy with the quality and they do not come close to $1,000 mattresses as advertised. There are two parts to this set. The mattress is not all the way through the top portion and the bottom part is made out of cardboard with no box springs."
3,Sex With Strangers,"This is a documentary of swinging couples. The group I went with to the movie found that it was not a typical representation of the majority of people in the lifestyle. We found it very funny and there were comments made out loud during the show from other patrons of the theater. Basically it made the guys look like jerks, so men may not find it as funny as the ladies did. The group I went with enjoyed it and got a lot of laughs from watching the film. It was more like watching a ""cult"" film."
2,Not the best example,"Whereas the events being portrayed are obviously happening and while its quite certain that there are, undoubtedly, many people who use sex as a means to harm others, I found the couples being focused on FAR too mentally/emotionally messed up to deal with the issue at hand - swinging.Swinging becomes the backdrop for the distorted view of a few, odd, practitioners. If these sorts of people were a ""type"" that dominated swinging, nobody would ever take it up.This DVD is ineffective as a view into the lifestyle and even less gratifying as sexual stimulation."
5,bueno!,"a friend had these and we fell in love (we= myself, husband and 1yr old). they are colorful, artistic, sturdy and spinny. They will stick to fridges, metal doors, desk handle plates, vents..where they spin and spin. They do gear up together but only for a few spins and then they seperate. And be warned when you open the container- they stink! My husband said it's the phalates... bummer! I put them outside for about a week and they now only smell if you directly sniff them. Overall a great and attractive toy but I wish they made a non toxic kind."
2,Many roads not listed or in error,"I was in shock to use this map. I have always trusted Delorme to have the best back road maps anywhere, but this one had a lot of errors. For context, I travel the smallest, outback roads for camping/exploring. I found this Kentucky map to have a lot of roads not listed were there and roads listed that weren't there, especially in the Daniel Boone National Forest and Big South Fork areas that I visited. I would still recommend the map, but just be aware that you will need other forms of navigation and maps to assist this map."
3,Not as detailed as I'd hoped,"Not as detailed you say? Well, even with topo and all sorts of roads and county data, NO, not for me and here's why. By the way, I also bought a Tennessee map of the same kind. I like to take my motorcycle rides on roads that are very absent of traffic. I like to see areas that are ""roads less traveled"". I purchased these maps to find those roads and then convert that info to my GPS. I rode on roads that were not listed or shown on the maps. So, here is the bottom line. If you want these kinds of roads to ride the HOG on, just use Google and forget these maps. If you are running for office in a particular area, then probably a great buy."
5,Awesome!,Just plainly...Dallas is the most amazing screamer ever. old underOATH rocks. Octavio is an awesome guitarist. and that Marissa girl below me has no idea what she's talking about underOATH wise
4,Almost Perfect,"This is a great CD from a great band, but I wish the songs were a little heavier. I like bands like Poison the Well, Skycamefalling etc., and this really isn't that heavy. Overall though, very cool so it only lost one star for my minor complaint."
5,Underoath's best work,"I first heard ""They're only chasing safety"" and ""Define the Great Line"" before I heard this record. The melody, drums, and voice on this record are just so much more than new underoath. While I really like the two previously mentioned cd's. ""The changing of times"" will make you want to listen to it over and over. Probably the best Screamo-Christian I've heard in addition to Chasing Victory's ""I call this Abandonment"""
4,Great Album,"Some guy said these guys are bad hardcore, or not hardcore. ""These bands are TRUE hardcore.. Terror, Every Time I Die..""Don't even talk.Terror is terrible.Every Time I Die is basically bad and overrated. Their ONE song ""Ebolorama"" is a masterpiece though. That's basically ALL I'll give them.Underoath put out a good album.It's not as good as their old stuff, where they were good death metal, but it's still good. They show hints of hardcore, but they AREN'T pure hardcore.get it right."
3,"well too bad,.............","underoath isn't a hardcore band, they're not a black metal band, they're not a metal band, and they're sure not a heavy metal band. Underoath is metalcore. For those of you who don't know what that is, it's metal with hardcore influenced breakdowns and such. So now that we got that straightend out, here's my opinion on it.Underoath is a good band, in my opinion the screaming in the album sucks ass and is a waste, but the actual singing is good. The music is awsome and definity better than their latest album ""they're only chasing saftey"". The breakdowns are sweet, and the message behind the horrible screaming is good. If you didn't know Underoath is a chirstian band, who happens to be metal- core. Which is great for them, becuase most christian bands suck. The best song i think is ""when the sun sleeps""."
3,This is underOATH!?!?!?!!!,"This album is where UnderOath as they were in the good days of Act of Depression and Cries of the Past started to fade. There are about 3 good songs on this CD, not enough to make it worth purchasing.If you like this kind of music, go for it. I'm sure it is some of the best. But this is disgusting compared to what I know UnderOath to be."
2,Not that great,"I love Underoath, but not the old Underoath. A friend played me this CD, and it totaly sucked compared to ""They're only chasing safety."" The old vocalist sucks and spencer is way better. The singer w ho also drums is very good, and they didn't use him as much on this CD as they do on the new one. Buy the new Underoath CD."
5,Way better than their newest album.,"The music is better, but I can't understand what the old vocalist is saying. I don't care, it's still great."
4,great harmony,This sweet hardcore/metalcore album is very intense and yet very harmonic. Can't get much better than that.
2,what?,"I thought Underoath was a metalcore band... not Jimmy Eat World with distortion and screaming. Ohhhh, they lost the most talented member (ex-guitarist now) and they went melodic. I wanted to like this record, i really did. But after listening to it numerous times, i cant find many good factors about it. His vocals arent quite the same, i guess him getting older changed the depth and tone of it a bit. He also does WAY WAY WAY too much speaking. and what? They only play cheap ripped-off emo parts and octave chords? Like i said, the talented guitarist left the band. The drumming is still solid, but the keyboards are so annoying they cant be redeemed. The one and only thing i can truely say is good about this cd, is the drummers clean singing in the first track. From there on, this is a cd to skip."
1,Don't have any UNderoath cds becuz UNDEROATH SUX!!!!,"Ok, i don't care if any of you like underoath or not, but I just can't stand this band!!!!!! The guys voice just bugs yo DEATH!!!! I hate that super high pitched voice!!! AHHHHHH!!!!!! That's just my opinion. I'm not gonna say that you shouldn't buy this cd because all of my friends think that underoath rox so i guess im just differen't in this world. If you want a GOOD heavy metal cd, get demon hunter or living sacrifice!"
1,crazy,"i guess dallas and octavio leaving is the best thing that could ever happen to underoath, this was by far the worst underoath c.d. i've ever heard. i'm not sure if it's because it was back when they were younger or because of the difference in members but damn am i glad they've changed. their best c.d. so far is ""they're only chasing safety"" but ""define the great line"" is right behind it, not as great but still good. what that guy said about aaron was stupid, it may have upset you that he asked them to leave but he's smart for it. also, he's far from a fruit, he's an AMAZING drummer and great singer. he pretty much makes the band, sure spencer is good but aaron adds a special BAM to it. unlike other crappy christian bands. they have my complete respect."

2,Loved it as a teenager,"I must have read Dove five times as a teenager. I loved the true life adventure of someone my age. Robin's story increased my love of adventure, sailing and the sea. His search for truth and desire too read all the important books inspired me. I too read the Bible and saw truth, truth that was missing from my dead church background.Later, I re-read Dove as an adult. I found Robin's life immature and impetuous. But, what did I expect from a California teenager from the 60's? I still appreciate his impact on my life and consider Robin Lee Graham one of my life heros. He has flaws like every human. He overcame them in a way that everyone can learn from. ""Home is the Sailor"" is a good follow up to fill out his story. Incidentally, as of a couple of years ago, he still lived in Montana."
3,Dove many years later,It was a very romantic story which left me wanting more than his tears. There was not what I wanted from a young man in the experience of his life.The girl is in no way responsable for diluting what should have been a great sailing story. It just shows that youth should be spent growing up & doing these things when they area able to enjoy it rather than pine for a love who is trying to figure out how to meet you at the next port.Left wanting
5,This is an Awesome Book!,"I could not put this book down. I met a guy at a pub, and as we played pool, he told me about his life aboard his sail boat and how he acquired his Mount Gay Rum regatta cap. Somehow the subject of this book came up and he recommended it. It is a must read for sailors, ocean lovers, adventurers, and romantics. The author is so honest and his stories are inspirational. I love how he met his wife and the way they tackled life together. This book is a must-read!"
2,a diplomatic telling of a great tale,"A fantastic experience & adventure glibly and diplomatically told. The ""meet Patti, in love, go sailing, miss Patti, at next port write to Patti, still miss Patti, at next port meet Patti..."" theme is a bit repetitive but realistic for a lonely romantic teenager. More details of personal conflicts and thoughts would have been good, as would more technical detail. But all the same it is an inspiring and interesting read, and Robin Graham is to be congratulated for sharing his story with us."
3,A Sailor at a Young Age,This was a very interesting book written by a man who at the age of 16 decided to sail around the world alone. The book describes his journeys and his feelings as he experienced life alone.I believe this book is suitable for 8th through 12th graders based on conservative views of a parent. There is the use of swearing in the book so be aware of this before hand. I did appreciate the fact that the Lord Jesus led Robin to Him through his experiences. Would be interested to know how the family is doing now.
3,Boring and Repeditive,The book goes like this; I miss Patti; goes to a port; Patti!; leaves port; I miss Patti; goes to a port; I miss Patti more!; Goes to next port; Patti!. Repeat this through thirteen chapters and that is the book.
2,This book was ok,"I am in a 7th grade interdiplisenary class and we read the book DOVE. I thought it was an ok book. i can understand why it is not so good though, this author was not experienced. I am not very in to auto-biographies, so that is why. But other people's opinions differ and a lot of other people say it was a very good book."
1,Dove,"I found Dove, a memoir of a 15 year old who travels around the world in a boat, an extremely poor-written, dull book.Of course memoirs are not the best books on earth, but the author's writing style was dry and immature. For example, Graham uses the word ""weird"" about three times in one chapter. There is almost no emotion in this book; the author for the better part of Dove tells about where he went, what the scenery was, and about the natives of each country. The only central characters in the story are himself and his young love, Patti. The love story between Robin and Patti seemed to me very drawn-out and surprisingly dull. All the while, the author still could not tell his story in a way that might make me care about him and Patti.If you are interested in reading a book about a boy's naive, incorrect views of the world and about some so-and-so girl he meets, read this book. If you're interested in something well written, steer clear of this memoir."
4,great adventure story of courage and independence,"Many people fantasize about a fantanstic adventure yet very few have the courage to follow their heart and actually embark on the journey. This is the story of one young man who sailed a small boat around the world, facing all of the uncertainty, risks and amazing rewards one might encounter and discover on such a trip. Great story to read to children emphasizing independence and courage."
4,A highly recommended book!,"I really enjoyed this book. I am in an Interdisiplinary class, and we did a project on the book. I really learned a lot about the different countries and their cultures. I really got a feel for where Robin was during the book and what he was doing. I think that it was very well written and very detailed. I wish I had as much courage as Robin did to sail around the world!"
5,So far so good!,"I just started reading the book Dove in my Id class, once I picked it up I couldn't stop reading it but I had to because of further class assignments. So if you pick up the book and start reading it and don't like it then I suggest that you keep going because the farther u read the better it gets!"
3,It was quite inspiring!,"I read the book the Dove for a class assignment. I got more out of it than i expected. I think of course it could have been a little better but, to keep with the positive things. I really enjoy hearing about someone who takes life, grabs a hold and goes where one can. I mean we need to grasp it now before it's gone. The book displays someone who feels the same. I enjoyed it, and I recommend it to readers of all ages!"
4,Sailing solo around the world at such a tender age..,"This non fiction story is filled with interesting adventure. A young boy setting off to sail the world. Finding new friendships, discovering beautiful places and falling in love with a girl that was raised not too far from his home in the U.S., yet met half way around the world. A very good read."
5,Not Just For Diabetics,"While this drink seems to be marketed to diabetics (I don't have a sugar problem), I decided to try it because of its antioxidant ingredients. I feel good knowing that my ""snack drink"" is contributing to my good health rather than hurting me."
2,A Disapointing Sequel,"Although this sequel was eagerly awaited, it did not live up to its expectations. 'The Ocean Within"" chronicled real human emotion, but Tides existed merely to point out that families break up. Caldwell failed to portray her characters as realistically as in the prequel, and was often sidetracked by her theme of environmental conservation. All of this detracted from the substance of the book. However, I'm sure we can expect better works from this author in the future."
4,elegant and lovely,"Just like the title, just that i wish i could move the main part because the necklace can look crocked easily if its not hooked in the right hole...but great investment and very lovely box"
5,Pete Kelly's Blues,"It is great to finally get a copy of this flawed but very special film. The music score is great. I never thought I would get to see this film again, so I am grateful for it's release and to Amazon"
5,very good,"although a B movie peggy lee and ella are WOW and the music great plus the little bit of a young jayne mansfield really brings this flic up several notches, it was great to see it again after all these years"
3,Musical Stars,Musical Jazz Stars save this film from the ol heap. the film boasts a veteran cast and an idiotic plot.Once again Jack Webb gives us his impresssion of what Joe Friday would have been like as a band leader.The dialogue has not been changed to protect the writers.Could have been a lot better
3,Interesting film,"A pretty good film with a mostly good cast. Poor Jack Webb, he was a great producer and director but the original wooden Indian when it came to acting.Tells the story of a jazz band trying to make a living in the late 20s dealing with the mobs and club owners and each other. The costumes and sets are great, the music is good and the small sub plots are interesting.If you can ignore Jack you will probably enjoy this."
5,Xcellent,"Vendor shipped promptly, no problems.The movie is a bit of kitsch, but fun. Typical Jack Webb staccato style, but Peggy Lee is great and Ella Fitsgerald does a splendid version of the title song, the music is '30's cool, and the film deals with a very provocative and true period of early jazz dealing with the mob and such. Too bad it is a glitzy, not gritty, treatment...but I've loved the film for years and have gone through videocassetes of it to DVD's now. If it ocmes out in Bluray--- I'll buy it."
4,Jack's Pete,"After playing the old 45 rpm cuts inspired by the film, it was nice to see the movie again. I had forgotten Peggy Lee's fine work and,of course, Jack Webb is solid. Dick Cathcart's trumpet lends a hint of Bix to this good (albeit dated) musical story."
2,Content misleading,"Write-up on DVD reflected a number of movie trailers being part of the Pete Kelly`s Blues DVD however,24 Hour Alert was missing. I was part of this group in 1955 and was looking forwared to a copy. I returned the DVD with this information and requested help in finding the 24 hour alert trailer. Have not received any reply to date; but thanks for asking."
4,All that love of jazz,"Jack Webb loved jazz and the jazz age. That comes through loud and clear in Pete Kelly's Blues. I liked this movie immensely because it's a labor of love. Despite it's flaws (Jack Webb tends to be stiff at times) the movie works and works well. Meticulous attention to detail, Peggy Lee in a dramatic role as well as her glorious singing, Andy Devine as a cop along with the great Ella Fitzgerald and some of the best jazz music ever recorded plus a strong supporting cast, make this movie well worth savoring again and again.Charles Albrecht"
4,"Fair story, great jazz score","Not that great a movie, though it's saved by a terrific soundtrack. Jack Webb plays Kelly, a 1920s cornet player in Kansas City who runs into trouble with a gangster who demands ""protection."" He goes along with it for a while, but then decides to stand up for himself and comes out a winner (no surprise there). Ella Fitzgerald, Peggy Lee, and an excellent jazz combo add immeasurably to what's lacking in the story. Dick Cathcart did the trumpet dubs. Another plus is the wisecracking script - there are more sarcasms and smart-alecky quips per frame than just about anyplace else in moviedom, and most are real zingers. On the negative side, Webb is as stiff as a board (a style all his: think DRAGNET, only here he's even stiffer) and the shootout at the empty nightclub is on the far side of reality. Fun to watch, though."
2,A fizzler,I liked the beginning of the book but felt it fizzled out half way through. Nothing really made sense and I felt the ending was very trite. But the good news is Balogh has gone on to write some absolute classics....but this one isn't one of them.
4,Entertaining book with gorgeous photos,"An entertaining book with memorable personalities and their world famous baubles. The section on socialities and the nobility is fun to read; especially countess Mona von Bismarck. The incredible story of Poor Little Rich Girl, Barbara Hutton and socialite Daisy Fellowes (she must have been an incredible woman, reading her self-improvement on her nose!). Some of the gems are world famous, like the bejewelled menagerie of the Duchess of Windsor, her cats, her flamingo, her tiger lorgnette etc. All in all, a fun book to read, but not only for lovers of jewellery, but also for people who are interested in royalty, fashion and high society. In short, a nice coffeetable book!"
3,Good ....but,I was a bit dissapointed with the Irish orchestra here and the sound spectrum was a bit diffuse...the strings are good but not as good in the previous #2 performance in this series. I am still a believer in Jochum's 8 in Berlin from the early 60s...it is a less literal approach to the score but the phrasing is superior to this interpretation. As to Tinter I tend to find some of the phrases wonderfully natural but a bit more bite at times could defintely go a longer way.Overall good for budget but does not dissplace Karajan and Jochum and even Barenboim.
5,For pets as well as people,"Designed as something calming that can be played for your pets while you're away to soothe separation anxiety, but also enjoyable for anyone."
2,different,This movie was OK. Did not spur any emotion within me. The part I hated was when the girl kissed the main lead after he had just thrown up.
4,See it for one reason: RYAN GOSLING,This is one of the most amazing acting performances EVER. Gosling instills commanding attention to the screen with his bristling energy. I've never seen anything quite like it. Amazing. THIS should have at least garnered an OSCAR nomination.
5,mesmerizing !!!!,"This movie had me glued to the t.vm Ryan Gosling has a charismatic presence and you tell what he's feeling throughout the movie, even when he doesn't say a word. As Danny was conflicted between the the two worlds of either being a nazi or a jew, he decides to try both at the same time, with it coming to a feverpitch at the end. The ending is profound and was utterly sad and depressing."
4,"'To Believe or Not to Believe""",An excellent depiction of a soul in torment as this young ersatz Nazi (who happens to be Jewish) struggles with the ambivalence of a self-hatred masked as totally rationalized Anti-Semitism.
4,The Believer changed my view of myself and Jewishness,"I've never been involved in Judaism or Jewish affairs. But The Believer has changed that. I'm not suddenly a convert and The Believer isn't prosyletizing. The movie simply explores a character who is deeply troubled, untangling his binds and asking how they turn him back to ideas he once renounced. Though the background and renunciation are particular and extreme--a Jew who becomes a Nazi--the essential struggle is not. Anyone who feels themselves a host of paradoxes and incosistencies could find in this movie a character to sympathize with."
3,A Little Slow But Carries Many Important Messages..,"I just finished watching this film and am still pondering its messages. I was raised Jewish but have turned away from practicing the religion because i found it to be hippocritical. I consider myself an atheist, and am definitely not a arcist or nazi. If anything, this film exposes the stupididty of the current youth nazi generation who no longer even understand what it is about Jews that they hate so much. Through the views of a right-wing political group that the movie's protagonist wants to join, we see that even they do not see anti-semitism as a means to further their politics. 'People today just don't mind Jews as much as they used to'. Although I was not riveted by the drama, it is an important film for jews and non-jews alike to view. It tackles important issues and values that are at the core of our society."
5,Wonderfully Disturbing,"The Believer is easily one of the best films of the year. While it is disturbing and sometimes difficult to watch, it is also an intellectually breathtaking and profoundly moving film that no lover of thought-provoking cinema should miss..."
5,What a Wonderful User Friendly book,I was not sure what to expect on ordering this book.Im so glad I did.its perfect for my needs..it gives everything from materials used for each..painting...why...and all techniques.I do watercolor and stamping and arcylic painting..this is perfect for my needs ..oil painting is also included..this is a treasure...and has history on miniature paintings included..its a pretty book..lots of color pictures..well worth the price..B.W.
1,Product NEVER RECEIVED!!!,I was ripped off. Product was never sent or received. Don't order from them!
4,Great CD,Great! some of the stuff in between the song seemed like it was there to take up a bit of time. Everything was well done. Occasionally the camera moved around a little too much.
5,Relentless Is Awesome! AAA+++,"This DVD is a must have. Wonderfully done, picture and sound quality A+! Walter Trout is one of the finest guitar players in the world and he shows it on this DVD.Along with his extraordinary playing are his vocals that are fantastic. The band with him is awesome, Joey Parfumi on drums and Jimmy Trapp playing bass really lay down the groove while Sammy tears it up on organ. I ordered two to give out for xmas, I'm ordering another because this is just so good my son's guitar teacher has to get one too. This is an awesome DVD! Buy It!!!"
2,W Trout is relentless @ throwing the same old stuff...,"This DVD is Walter Trout & Band, doing the same old stuff, without any flash or bang; I wish I'd have saved my money, but it'll be added to my DVD library & rarely dusted off...Ho Hum"
3,Somewhat of a letdown,"I have constantly devoured Mr. Collin's work over the years and have especially enjoyed the Nate Heller series. I think this latest entry is possibly the weakest of the series.Perhaps it's the fact that the ""true crime"" reported on in this story is not at all recognizable to anyone except possibly the most devoted crime buffs. Previous stories of the Lindbergh kidnapping, the Black Dahlia, Huey Long etc. struck more of a chord with me than the murder of an obscure Chicago policeman.But there is hope. Jack Ruby makes a very brief appearance, could it be that sometime in the future Nate will become involved with the Kennedy assassination?"
3,I'm enjoying but am giving up on this one....,"I'm surprised no one else mentioned this. The type-face is extremely small throughout this book. In fact, it is so small that I find it completely exhausting to read.I don't even have glasses, yet feel like I need them every time I sit down and read 10 pages of this book.Strange decision by publisher. I'm enjoying but have decided to give up on this one."
4,A Warm Reminiscence of an Irish Sojourn,"Jaywalking is the story of an Irish-American family who leave their comfortable existence in the States for an adventure in the land of their ancestors. The Ireland that they encounter has some of the mysticism and welcome of the mythical Erin but it has plenty of warts, as well.In addition to the chronicling of the family's internal struggles and external associations, the author interweaves key elements of Irish history which provide insight into the persona of the Gael. This is an enjoyable and interesting book. It is a bit dated, in that it takes place during the halcyon days of the Celtic Tiger but I wholeheartedly recommend it."
4,I found this video to be very heart moving and touching.,Full credit to the producers and directors. I found this video to be very heart moving and touching. It was emotionally depressing at made me really think about how lucky I am. But I don't think I could possibly watch it again.
3,first aid kit,i am disappointed that the first aid kit i paid for and ordered was not what i received. However because of the hassle and cost in returning this item i have decided to keep it.
3,First Aid,"I am satisfied with the product, but the product delivered was not the one pictured on the web-site. The one I received was in a blue case and the outer wrappings or box was crushed."
5,Very Useful Fist Aid Kit..,I ordered one and my husbank liked it to put it in his truck. It is very small and has lots of things..
3,"Easy, Great for Text, Advertising","If you are interested in doing ad work, this is a clever, easy to read handbook by Kelby. visuals very good. Otherwise, gives a few good tips for others...great shadow technique, for example"
2,Should Have A Parental Warnning,"My mom bought a tape of this guy at a truck stop. The bad thing was that me and my brother were too young to get the jokes we were 10 and 12 and my mother was realy embarised by the bit on ""KY Jelly"".Now I am older and I feel that I will get the jokes"
3,The foundation from which Isis came,"Since I reviewed the new Isis album Wavering Radiant, I figured I'd go back in time and give a review on Mosquito Control.Now, anyone expecting to find what Isis is doing nowadays on this album is going to be in for a brutal surprise. This album came out when Isis was a lot angrier and drawing a large degree of influence from Neurosis and Godflesh. Translation, it's heavy as all get out. The guitars get a little too atonal at times and Aaron Turner was still discovering himself as a vocalist, but despite lacking the polish they've developed now, this album still managed to be raw, intense, chaotic, and powerful.I recommend it for Isis fans, fans of modern American metal, and for people who have a sound system in their car, largely because the bass in this album is phenomenal."
5,Must-have for those interested in Ájé (iyaami),"In the west, where the knowledge of the sacred techonology of the mother is almost non-existant, this book is a blessing. Gives a great introductory understanding of the dynamic force/being/ability/power that is Ájé."
2,Not sure.,"this book was a little over the top for me. i wanted to enjoy it but it was a little too graphic. It was not a bad book, in fact if one likes this genre it is very good."
1,Smonk,"If you like a lot of gore then you will love this book. I found the beginning so raunchy I couldn't get involved in the characters or their stories. I have read other Franklin books and really enjoyed his ability to make you feel for his characters, faults and all. But this one lost me in the beginning and I doubt I will ever finish it."
2,"A ""could have been"" interesting fable that didn't work for me","I really liked Tom Franklin's first novel, ""Hell at the Breech."" But I thought this little novel was just plain silly. I'm sure Franklin intended the orgy of blood, violence, perversion, sadism, etc. etc. to make a larger point, ... I just missed it.To me, it was like a really bad B-movie, maybe like the ""chain saw massacre"" thing, just not as clean, wholesome, or compassionate.According to the list of positive reviews listed inside the cover, a bunch of critics apparently hailed this as fine, cutting-edge literary something. I thought it was preposterous. I might have felt differently if there had been a shred of plausibility, but this was all so over-the-top, I couldn't really buy into any of it."
4,different,"I kept wondering where he was going. His descriptions were so good I kept reading, though tempted to give it up. It was well worth it to read to the end - and then want more!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Less than you'd get from the History Channel,"_Fascism_ is more a history of various fascist movements than an explanation of what Fascism actually was, and at 100+ pages, it's not a very extensive history. Beginning with an chapter on why there is disagreement on the nature of Fascism, Thurlow proceeds to give paragraph-long descriptions of some major theories on it. He seems to lean towards Fascism as a ""stillborn revolution"" whenever he discusses the fascist aspects of of Italy and Germany, but this is the least satisfying theory of them all. Thurlow does not distinguish between Fascism in theory and Fascism in practice, and thus has a great deal of difficulty saying anything about it. This book seems written in order to round out the series, rather than to actually be used by anyone who knows enough about Fascism to be interested in it."
1,I did not receive the pakage,I ordered the dummy knob and i think they shipped it to the wrong address and they wont admit it and i'm too busy to follow up.Bad experience with this seller (KB Hardware)
1,It doesn't work in any of the bottles we have,I thought this was a great idea - so I bought 2 sizes. However - it doesn't fit in any of the bottles we use. It rests on the bottle top and doesn't allow the cap to screw on. I tried on both Evenflo Purely Comfi bottles and Dr. Brown's. What a waste of money . . . it should tell you what bottles it will work with so you don't waste your money.
3,great and horrible at the same time,"I loved this bottle straw and it is perfect for my daughter. However, not long after we started using it the straw came apart from the nipple base and won't stay together and therefore can not be used anymore. If they find a way to keep them together better then I would give it 5 stars."
5,A little better than stock filter,"I don't think this filter is a miracle and it's hard to tell whether the HP of my 2009 Vibe went up or not. Acceleration seems a touch smoother. I noticed a very slight increase in the mileage. I travel daily exactly the same route to work and back. A very uneventful drive and the same road conditions day in day out. A week worth of driving (~420km) saves me just under a gallon of gas.My main reason for buying was the economy. It needs to be reconditioned after about 50,000 kilometers, but I think I'll just get a new one.No regrets."
3,K&N High Performance Air Filter,"Looking forward to increasing my rating of this product but I have yet to burn through a couple of tanks between my new Corolla (engine still being broken in) and my 96 Expedition. I've seen avg mpg increase about a gallon on the Corolla, but have yet to know for sure what it does until the engine is broken in. Just over 1,000 miles on the Corolla. As for the Expedition, I'm only driving it on weekends. I'll know more after cycling through a number of fill-ups. I'm hoping to increase mpg to around 15 on that rig. Currently I average just over 12 mpg."
5,Speed Racing Merchandise,The KN air filter came in record time. It made my car move faster than the speed of light. Thanks KN for this item. No more cleaning. I love it!
2,Hmmm...,"** Fear is a complex emotion. Evoking horror is not dependent upon the circumstances so much as upon how the circumstances are used. Drawing upon techniques mastered by Stephen Crane and Edgar Allen Poe, Ms Irving uses minutae to create a sense of dread from events not always fearful on the surface. Using everything from spiders to children, she tells tales to keep you up at night. Watch the shadow carefully, you never know what might lurk within them. **Amanda Killgore"
3,"Welcome to Grim City, KY","This is a great novel that focuses more on the turmoil within the lawyer than within the courtroom. The second main character, the town of Grim City is very fictional but also a real town in the sense that you may have driven through it once, somewhere"
3,Emergency Medicine and the Law,"As an Emergency Medicine resident with an interest in Legal Aspects/Risk Management I was somewhat disappointed with this book. It is part of a British series of medicine books (Oxford Handbooks). Chapters are divided up into key points, description of cases with points of interest, and practical points. The down side is the book is based on the English legal system which is much different than the US system. One example is in the chapter for obtaining consent from minors they use the 'Gillick aware' standard. They do explain the background for it, but in the US we don't have a case law precedent we use for the determination of competence. For practical purposes it has no benefit for practicing EM physicians in the US. There are better US books out there. It would interest people with an interest in the law and the British system."
1,Don't waste your money,"I guarantee you that these sandals will not stay on your foot. Great concept - terrible design. I tired re-enforcing the straps with some rope and was able to walk around about 2 minutes longer before they become loose again. The box recommends using them while you mow the yard - yeah, if you want to spend 12 hours mowing. Don't waste your money."
3,Work... with some patience...,"It takes some patience to install these... they would not go onto my boots, nore work on bare foot. Though ... they worked fine with dress shoe! Work fine, I walked over some hard areas where the spikes supported my whole weight... if you will happen to step into clay soil it will be difficult to pull back."
3,not what I expected....,"They sink VERY DEEP into the ground. Hard to walk in. They sink so deep they remove themselves from your shoe, I would only suggest wearing boots."
2,Good Idea bad aplication or design,"I bought these to get some air into the soil, just like the rest of you are planning.Putting them on is easy, straps are way to big. but OKTook 1 step into the yard and they fall off in the back and give you a pretty nice dig on the ankle. Readjusted and the same result..pretty much useless. Buy the hand aerator with a shovel handle and get a work out at least it will work..."
1,Dangerous - useless tool,"The idea seemed like a good one, so I bought them. BAD move on my part. I would make these Bosmere Aerating Sandals, Model K764 a -10 stars, if it were available. Here are the negatives:1. They collect almost anything you step on (e.g., dirt, leaves, grass) and it tends to clump onto the sandles with the spikes as a reatainer.2. They will not say in position on the shoes, no matter what shoes you use.3. The retainer straps comes loose easily. Even tying the in knot after tension, doesn't help.4. The spikes come loose easily and require retighening after a few uses.5. The loosness, repositioning, clumpng of debris causes ankles to twist and can result in serious injury.Solution: Place into the trash after use. Better yet, DON'T buy them!"
1,"Missing pages, poorly printed, pages out of order.","The copy I received was missing pages. One page had the print running off one side, as a document might appear if it had been misfed through a photocopier. In another place, page 23 followed page 21, which was then followed by page 22. The quantity of sample language was a disappointment."
3,"Great album, Poor remastering","The remastering weakened the album in several ways. The percussion is too bright. The bass became stronger than necessary. The vocals are not loud enough. Basically, the whole album sounds like you're only listening to the drums. I want my music!! It really soured my enjoyment of the Wedding Present. Whoever produced this reissue I'm gonna say not so nice things about. Don't buy this. Buy a used copy of the original issue. *sigh*"
3,Mystery,"When there's a multiple homicide in a locked church, Cardinal Cronin dispatches Bishop Blackie Ryan to ""see to it."" Blackie immediately finds that the situation is a lot more complex than he counted on it being. He's solved quite a few locked room mysteries in his time, and finds them not too challenging, but this one is. The neighborhood is plagued by racism and internal politics. Moreover, Blackie realizes that something about this case is related to an event that happened over fifty years ago, and that his father investigated. It's just another day at the office for everyone's favorite priest.Whether you enjoy mysteries or not, Blackie, Sean, Nuala, and all the familiar characters as well as the new ones that Father Greeley has brought to life are worth revisiting. The warmth in his writing is like a cuddly blanket on a cold night.Amanda Killgore"
3,good soud quality for the price,"I bought these speakers when I fist got my computer whcih was about a year ago. For fifteen bucks I was very surprised by the soudnd quality and ease of use. the one big problem that I had with them was that when you crank them up, they become prety staticy and the sound quality goes way down, also was a little dispaointed with the fact that there is no sub woofer. despite all of this they were only 15 dollars. I would recomend this to anyone who eihter does not use their computer very much or does not like/need high sound volume. I recently upgraded to a surround sound system by creative labs and am much happier with it."
2,You get what you pay for,"These are okay speakers but not if you are serious about good sound, especially with headphones. Anytime the headphones were plugged in, I was listening to static and lots of it. I even tried different sets of headphones. These are not good computer speakers."
3,"This CD is ok, but.......","it ain't exactly as good as 'From The Heart'. This shouldn't however diminish from Daryle's keyboard playing. He's good, but for whatever reason I just wasn't feelin' him on this one."
5,Ecco Women's Golf Shoes,"The Golf shoes are very nice and stylish, I like the color, goes with everything. I Live in Florida and it is always wet, but this shoe keeps my feet and socks dry I highly recommend this shoe for any Golfer. Also the quality is excellent"
5,"Vicki Sue Robinson ""Finally""!!!","Finally ten years after her passing Vicki Sue Robinson's music get's released. For those who remember that summer of '76 and the big hit ""Turn The Beat Around"" you are in for a treat this was her first album full of rock, pop, soul, disco. Having not heard this album in years I forgot how great it is. The reissue label Goldlegion has done a great job in remastering and Christian John Wikane did a great job on the liner notes with alot of detail check him out on FaceBook. For VSR fans Goldlegion is releasing all four of her RCA album's check out their website."
4,Disco classic,"Highly enjoyable classic disco album by likable latin-american singer who sound absolutely unrestrained, crazy and passionate.The way she whoops with pleasure and even scatts,reminds of early Bette Midler,but she goes even further and even tops Midler with her own madcap energy. ""Turn the beat around"" was (deservedly) huge hit,but there are few similar,strong disco numbers (""Common thief"") and everything simply explodes with joy. Robinson is less effective on ballads that sounds like a filler and turn her into just another radio singer - her strongest point were happy,upbeat numbers with enough space for improvisation."
2,Not that bad!,"Nice story, but actors are all amateurs and absolutely no budget for the movie. Dont buy into it and save your money!"
3,Not Bad At All,"Great movie? maybe not, but it is a good movie, I was blown away by the acting from these street kids, I write screen plays for Spanish short films my self, and I was told they were not trained actors, and I could not believe it, and yes there are other things to Colombia than this, but this is part of the country (any other country in Latin America)and it can not be hidden, and that is the good thing about the movie, is real, every day, every minutes, every second, is about finding a way to make money, having something to eat, a place to sleep. Things that some of us take it for granted, is about surviving! even though is by crimes.Like I said, Good not Great!"
1,Bent over a table,"This book was the absolute worst textbook I have ever encountered. Unfortunately, I needed it for my first Master's degree class in Communications. Absolutely unclear in its explainations and problems and questions that seem to come out of the blue. The appendices were useless is describing queuing theory and statistics. The entire class hated this book, but had to buy it new. I'm embarrassed to say that the professor for the course reviewed it.This book is a huge waste of money and material."
1,1 star is too much for this book,"This has to be the worst textbook I have ever encountered. If you want to understand the material in this book, you should have plenty of networking background in your pocket already. Even with 5 years and industry certifications under my belt, I came away from this book with more confusion than understanding. Ross & Kurose is a better start, as is Todd Lammle's networking certification materials. For that matter, The Complete Idiot's Guide to Networking does a better job at explaining some concepts in this book than this book does. If the author had decided to go for clarity rather than brevity, this might be an ideal book for reference. As it is, it serves as little more than a $100 paperweight."
1,Poor quality and too expensive,"When I purchased the book, I thought it would be a concise yet well-explained book for the price. It turns out that it is horrible. The book leaves out many details, expects you to have previous knowledge of many topics (or to look outside for explanations), and has many errata. The figures are poorly drawn and explained. The problems often require more knowledge than is available in the book."
1,Get ready to slash your wrists!,"This is one of the worst texts I've ever read! The author writes as though the reader totally understands every complex example presented. This is amazing because some parts are very simple and easy to understand. The calculations and formulas are almost to impossible to comprehend. Don't waste your time with this book! There are better, more comprehesive communication networks books out there. This text is by NO means ""A First Course""!"
4,Decent taste for sugar free,I am not a big fan of sugared drinks and I always try to consume sugar free liquids. Red bull regular is a taste I do not like so I take the sugar free kind. This is better to mix with vodka too since you don't need more sugar with alcohol.
5,Works For Me,The folks in Austria have come up with a fine product. I gulp down a can of this sugarfree Red Bull every morning about an hour before I make my daily walk. It has made the walks much easier to complete and also increases the walking speed which in turn burns more calories with which I am glad to part. I happened to be over at Sam's club a while ago and they carry this product for 33 bucks and some change so I picked up a case while there. I live about 10 miles from Sam's so with gas prices ever climbing plus the state sales tax it would not be worth a trip just for the Red Bull. For only a couple bucks more Amazon will deliver a case right to my front door. Kinda pricey but the benefits to me are worth the cost.
5,My Coffee,"Ever since my first Red Bull I've been hooked. I switched from regular to sugar-free to cut back on sugar and at first it was a bit nasty, but over time it started to taste good. I drink Red Bull almost daily to get me going. Some people say it doesn't work for them, but it does for me. Red Bull gives you wings~"
4,Loves the Red Bull,"My girlfriend loves Red Bull so I bought this 24 pack as a gift (She was actually really excited about them). It's not much of a deal here, the only deal is/was that I did not have to go out and get them at a store."
3,Cheaper than buying from convenient stores,This is by far the best tasting RedBull and buying it this way is cheaper than buying singles or even a four pack from the store. Not sure why they are so much more than the Sugar Free though...
5,energy,"red bull gives you energy. maybe coffee does better, but who cares?red bull gives you energy. maybe coffee does better, but who cares?red bull gives you energy. maybe coffee does better, but who cares?"
4,Best Energy Drink,"This energy drink is great, no crash, taste good, and no calories. It is cheaper at some stores, but on amazon you get it delivered right to your door. Great product!"
4,"Shipping took a while, but otherwise ok.","My husband drinks energy drinks nearly every day, so I'm always looking for a good deal. These were on the Friday Sale, so I ordered a two-pack. It's an ok deal, but if you watch sales, you can find them about the same price elsewhere.I do like having them shipped to me. That's nice. Packaging could be a little better, but that feedback was left in the appropriate place. I just wish that it hadn't taken twice as long as any other product I have ordered with the Super Saver shipping. I know that it came well within the aloted time, and I know that they said it takes a few extra days, but I'm spoiled with Amazon's amazingly fast shipping. We had run out at home, and I was hoping to not have to make the shopping trip.In the end, my husband was quite happy to come home to a fresh 24 pack waiting for him on the doorstep."
2,"Sugar free Red Bull is great, this price SUCKS!!!",I love sugar free Red Bull and it's the only kind I drink. Go just about anywhere else and you'll see this price is a joke.
3,Total Zero Tastes Different Than Sugar Free - Don't Like,"I highly recommend you buy a single can of the new ""Total Zero"" version of Red Bull before you buy a case of Total Zero. That way, if you don't like it, you've only bought one can, not 24.I'm a long time user of both the regular (""Original"") version and the sugar free version.For my tastes, there isn't a huge difference between the Original version and the sugar free version, but there is a noticeable difference between the sugar free and ""Total Zero"" versions.Everything tastes different to different people, but I don't like the new Total Zero version. It leaves, for me, a mediciney after-taste. If you are drinking this late at the bar with your favorite adult beverage, you might not care, but I drink my Red Bulls by themselves as a pick me up during the day.Now, what do I do with the 23 other cans....?"
2,"serial port bad, plug and pray, no monitor port","I bought this to add serial port, monitor to my laptop.No go with the serial port, I cant get it to work. Re-installation of software (far from plug and play) yields no solution. No port for a monitor. Now I get USB device error."
4,"Great clarity, slightly awkward size","I agree with previous reviews. I have had no problems with the clarity and range, but the handset is a little too big to hold with ease and too small to cradle in the neck."
2,Consider it disposable,"I want to echo other reviewers' comments that the battery life for this phone is very short. Ours was low and a brief power outage apparently blew out the whole phone. We've replaced the battery but the phone appears to be quite dead. When it worked, it performed quite well (good range, excellent clarity)."
1,Horrible phone,"This is a good phone, it gives great reception, etc. But 1) no headset jack 2) I have had it replaced 3 times, the phone just dies after a while, consider a panasonic gigrange or one of the colored vtech's"
3,Good but can be better.,Very good sound quality. Starts giving low-power beeps after ~1.5 hrs. talk which are annoying. Also absence of headset option can be a liability.
4,A good basic cordless phone and the price is right.,"I have owned this phone for almost a year and I am delighted. The range is tremendous. The size, weight and feel are excellent. The only drawback is that it does not include a headphone jack."
1,Worst cordless phone I've ever used,"This phone has everything at the right price, too bad it doesn't work. If a cordless phone is supposed give the user freedom of movement, than this is the ultimate failure. From the first day in operation, the phone's reception started to break up if you took the phone more than 5 feet from the base, there was no chance if you went into another room. When I called AT&T to troubleshoot, they told me to pull out the antenna - duh, its a fixed length antenna, it doesn't extend. Then they told me to ship it back. Why, because they know this product is a DOG!"
2,Cheap DSS phone - you get what you pay for,"The phone clarity is okay, but not great. Sounds as if I am talking in an echo chamber which is very disappointing. Distance is good though and I do not get a significant degradation as I leave the base. This is important since I go to my neighbor's house a lot. One problem - though it fits in my pocket, it is too easy to depress the talk button, causing the darn thing to turn on all the time."
1,"Sadly, a product with many lemons","I bought this phone at the local Office store and it worked great for about a month, then all of a sudden it stopped. It did nothing but beep, no dial tone, nothing... tried everything, the phone still wouldn't work.Went back and exchanged it for the new Power Advantage 4.0 AT&T 9520, it's everything this phone wasn't. Much greater range, very light and compact, fully recharges in only 4 hours and comes with a spare battery, highly recommended. It definitely restored my faith in AT&T."
1,I would never buy AT&T again,"I ordered one of these phones from Amazon, thinking it was a great deal. It was...a great deal of hassle! It would not charge, or function in any way, so I emailed Amazon, and they sent me a replacement. But the replacement also didn't work, having the exact same problem. I went through the symptoms with people on the manufacturer's 800# trouble shooting line, and they said I had got defective units. But two in a row is too much. Needless to say I am returning the phone.I should have stuck with my old brand, Panasonic.It just shows you get what you pay for.Also, I must mention that I thought that the service I got from Amazon was great. They replied very quickly to my emails, and solved the problem (to the extent they could)."
1,Disappointed. Beware!,"Like others, mine died when its internal recharger soon refused to recharge its battery. This phone worked for 1 week. I won't buy another from AT&T. I liked the small size and appearance, but not the range either. I have been using the Escort 9600 spread spectrum digital with up to a 3/4 mile range! Its even smaller; pocketable. I take it home from my office (1/2 mile away) and still receive business calls while I'm goofing off. If you live in a real small town, you don't need a cell phone with the Escort. Sound quality is good too. The AT&T wouldn't do that. You can add a basestation antenna extension on the roof if you need more distance... but few people do. So... take your chances... but realize that for this cheap a price you don't get quality control or reliability even though you might get a decent value."
1,This phone has a mind of its own,"I thought this phone was so great I had other family members buy it (BIG MISTAKE!) It's got great range and sound quality but unplug the base or start having low battery problems or a power outage and the phone quickly becomes a bad buy. It's difficult to correct the incessant beeping and even after a call to Lucent to get a new battery we still had difficulties.There are too many other good products on the market to deal with a crazy maker like this! If you actually buy this phone you gotta be asking yourself ""Do you feel lucky....well do ya?"""
2,frustrating,"The form factor of the handset is a bit unweildy: large and heavy enough to notice, but too small to cradle between head and shoulder for brief two-handed operations.The handset runs down its battery quickly.The power supply on mine died within 4 months.When the power goes out, the base station beeps annoyingly. So, if you're sleeping peacefully through a middle of the night power outage, the phone will wake you up. Further, it is far from clear how to make it stop this behavior.All in all, this phone is a fair step *DOWN* from a simple table-top phone.For the record, I'm not a neo-luddite; I'm a software engineer who carries a Pilot. I like tools that make my life easier. This just isn't one of them."
1,Worst ATT Phone,"This is the worst att phone that I have had. DO NOT BUY IT. But all the other ATT phones are great. I have 2 9450 (good) and 2 9400 (bad) The only problem is that they are all 900mhz DSS and if you are talking on one and so is someone else, if you get too close to the other base or phone it creates interferance (kind of like what you would get with a digital cell phone). But this would probably happen with any DSS/2.4 ghz phone."
2,Doesn't work with a headset,"This phone doesn't work with a headset, a necessity if you spend much time on the phone."
1,no remote access,I am very surprised that a phone of this type does not have remote access As a stockholder I feel ATT should encourage phone use.
1,Probably counterfeit,"I ordered this one last month, and didn't keep a note of the vendor. It arrived with a genuine-looking label in the jewel box, sounds fine, but there is no label on the CD itself. This means you have one chance in two of putting it in the player right-side up."
2,"on time, but too much high lights in book.","I want to thank the company for delivering the book on time, but it had to much high-lighting in it, to be sold for the price they were asking. It was worn way past ""Like New"" advertisement they posted."
3,"Dude is right,","Dude that posted the review before me is spot on. Celcius was NOT released with Tech N9ne's permission. Celcius is a collaboration of whatever Tech songs (finished or unfinished) that MidwestSide Records had recorded and quickly released after Tech and them seperated ties, in an attempt to make money of off Tech N9ne's name. So just keep that in mind when you're listening to this. You can really tell that Tech had nothing to do with this by the album cover art. I gotta give this a three at least because it is Tech N9ne. There is some decent material on here, but you'll end up paying a lot of money for it. So don't get your hopes up too high after you shell out the cash."
3,CD problem (unable to read),"There was no music on this CD (must be some write error)[UPDATE] September, 01, 2011:Waiting for the replacement CD. Will update this review in a few weeks.[UPDATE] September, 12, 2011:Got the new CD and it had no problem this timeThe music is OK but a must have for true Tech N9ne fans. I support true artists and so should you!"
4,S&P collecing,"One of the first (and one of the best) books I bought on S&P collecting. It has a wonderful section of S&P Condiment Sets, from those I have & can afford, to those I hope to find at a bargain basement cost. The Black Americana section is also very good. The value section has sent me back to antique shops to buy S&Ps I thought too costly, but were a good deal in the long run. High recommended for all."
2,"Great Pictures, Little Useful Information","I have close to 50 reference books on various type of collectibles, and based on some very positive reviews, I decided to add this book to my collection.The bad news is that the book is nearly devoid of useful information that might help a collector to determine age, origin, etc. The good news is that I bought this as a used book, so I didn't have to pay full price! The other good news is that the book has many excellent pictures. Most of the descriptive text, however, simply describes what you are looking at in the pictures.If you are interested in learning about this collectible category, look elsewhere. If you just like to look at colorful pictures of interesting s&p; shaker sets, this is the book for you!"
1,Security stickers,"Be advised that these people send security stickers via USPS, and the envelope requires a signature. That means if you're not home at the time of delivery, you have to go to the Post Office to pick it up. Stupid!"
1,"Leaks, what a mess.","We were looking for a portable coffee/cappuccino maker and thought this would fit the bill. After numerous attempts we found this difficult to use and the coffee sub-par. Also, used a great deal of coffee to make just 1 cup."
1,"The main seal leaks, brand new out of box.","I bought this for my wife for Christmas. Right out of the box, even on the first 'prep-run', (without coffee, water only), the main top seal would NOT seal tight. I tried a 'snug' tight, a 'very hard tight' and a 'with everything I had-tight' and it NEVER would seal. There was more water coming out from around the lid than came out from the spout. All instructions were followed as written. Sorry.... this thing goes in the trash... lesson learned."
1,Really wanted to like it!,"First I will say that the bellman is very well-made. I have a gas stove and it is difficult to make espresso in this machine. It would probably work well on an electric top. I have tried 3 x to make espresso on my stove with this maker. Aside from being unstable, it shoots espresso and steam all over the place! I have followed the directions to a t."
2,Arrived on time,Bought knowing it was used.Said it was in very good condition.Was very dirty and stained and came with no instructions.After several cleanings (cuz I did not want someone else's coffee goo in my Latte); I tried to use it.To no avail.Ten attempts later and waste of lots of coffee it still will not made the coffee.Milk steamer works great.Seller would not honor return.Stuck with it.Wish I would have spent the extra $40.00 and bought it from AMAZON - new- and returnable or with good instructions.Very unhappy.KC
4,talk that talk brother!,I really felt the positive energy in the words coming from a brother who can speak so bluntly with compassion to us sisters. It's good to finally see a man (black man) lay down some law in a intelligent manner so that we can all get this relationship thing right today! I've seen my share of drama so I could relate to what the book was talking about. Mr. Long it was a pleasure to meet u in philly and you were true to your word in saying that this book would certainly be an experience. Keep up the good work.
2,Cumbersome,"I found the book faily cumbersome. While Garner's previous books were successful in merging text and audio for an enjoyable experience, I find it a stretch to combine text, audio and video. I found this to contribue to ""sensory overload."""
2,"Book was good, DVD stunk!","Garner does a good job WRITING about television,but when it comes to SHOWING television history on the DVD, he failed miserably. Too much blabbing and not enough actual footage. The worst was the segment on ""Cheers""--they only showed STILLS, nothing of the shows! Please--if you couldn't get the rights from NBC, you should have just skipped it! And then there was John What-his-name (Cliff) saying that Sam and Diane were like ""Tracy and Bacall."" Hello?? Perhaps ""Tracy and Hepburn"" or ""Bogart and Bacall,"" but ""Tracy and Bacall""?? This DVD misses the mark, just like ol' Cliffie."
3,bavaria,"This movie was shot in bavaria. In a little village called SCHMIDMÜHLEN. I'd like to watch it, unfortunately it isn't availably in germany."
4,A Classical Haydn,"I bought this recording because I wanted to explore some of the lesser known Haydn string quartets. Like others, I was impressed by reviews I'd read of the Kodaly/Haydn cycle, and the price was certainly modest. What I received is a delightful performance, recorded in a clear, rather distant acoustic. The Kodaly Quartet delivers the music without a distracting interpretive overlay. The performances show a seasoned ensemble working together in the service of the composer and his music. I liked the approach sufficiently to order a number of other recordings in the series. Some may prefer a more dramatic rendition, but I find the clarity and elegance of the Kodaly performance to accord better with the Classical restraint of the early Haydn. Given the sound quality, the performance, and the modest pricing, this is an easy recommendation. I think others will find it pleasurable as well."
1,The Complete Haydn Quartets,"I bought a handful of CDs from Naxos featuring the Kodaly Quartet because they had fair reviews and were extremely cheap. At the very least I thought I would get a bargain.Sadly, the performances are so stodgy and boring I am unable to listen to them. This is the kind of playing the perpetuates the myth that Haydn is somehow an `easier, lesser composer for warming a quartet concert audience.` The only person who might perhaps be interested in these performances might be an A level music studnet who needs ot study a specific work and is -very- short of cash.There are plenty of modern alternatives such as the Emerson or Lindsays if you have tired of the older groups like the Hungarian, Budapest or even the Capet."
1,Buyers Beware!,"This book might be useful for college students, but WILL NOT help you with the probation officer exam."
5,A great gift,I purchased this pendant for my wife on our 40th anniversary (ruby). I found the quality and workmanship to be superb. My wife loved it. It looks more elegant in hand than on the site.
1,wrong stuff,"i recieved the cheap version of the axe advertised, which split after a few strikes, the pine handle was absolute garbage, Gransfors Bruks! they're the only well made axes on the market, however they are quote expensive"
5,This has to be one of the best comedy cd's ever put out!,this cd is a classic for people who love country and for people that hate country music. If you're in the mood for a good laugh this disk is for you.
4,The Traitors Wife,Very well done. I enjoy learning the history of the U.K. through the participants even if the story line is fictitious.
1,Horribly Long,"Ugh this book was painfully long. Not a horrible plot, but incredible amounts of useless details and everyone has the same name! If you are currently researching the history of English royals in the 1300's, this might be your kind of thing. If you are anyone else, stay away!"
1,Inappropriate and unneccessary,"I only read up to page 18 but in that short amount of reading there were five implied sex scenes (some involving a homosexual couple). It was very inappropriate and not needed to get a good story across. If you want a clean historical fiction novel, stick with Jean Plaidy."
3,Likeable once you get your bearings,"I like historical fiction and this was a free kindle download so I thought I would try it. It was long and sometimes confusing ( so many characters have the same name, or their name changes because they become an Earl or a knight or a wife of someone). But I liked the story. Eleanor is a likable character, even if she is naive. You can clearly see the path of destruction being laid out for her family, and how she's powerless to stop it, and you just shake your head. The fact that it is based on actual events makes you shake your head harder. This book isn't for everyone- you need some patience. Plus I went online to read about the real Edward II, the Le Despensers, and others involved so I could understand what was going on. I am probably going to read the sequel, Hugh and Bess."
2,It was okay,"I guess I've just been spoiled by reading Sharon Kaye Penman. Although the subject is fascinating and it was well-researched, I just wasn't mesmerized as I have been reading Penman's historical novels. The editing was pretty appalling in places. On page 135, she states ""She was an invertebrate receiver of gossip..."" and there were other similar gaffs that I found very distracting (although amusing). Even better was on page 448 when ""Hugh le Despenser and William la Zouche had allowed their horses to slow down so that the ladies were astride them."" My, my. I guess it kind of works, if you use the definition of ""astride"" as ""on either side of""; but it's a little startling when you first read it. Would I read it again? No. Would I recommend it? Well, if Sharon Kaye Penman writes a book about Edward II, that's the one I'd recommend."
4,Entertaining Tale of Love,"This is one of those BIG books that you want to curl up with on a rainy day and lose yourself in the 14th Century. Eleanor de Clare's life is filled with incident,to say the least. She takes a lickin' and keeps on tickin'. The love affair between the king and her husband is handled beautifully and you understand the why's and wherefore's of how this came to be. Edward's wife, Queen Isabella, becomes someone you love to hate. What a bitch! And so is her lover, Mortimer. One thing, most of the characters are referred to sometimes by name and sometimes by title. With such a large cast, you might find yourself turning back to remember that Mortimer is also Earl of March. I recommend this novel whole heartedly. Lots of treachery, lots of unusual liasons, lots of suffering, but lots of fun. PS, pls excuse any mis-spelled words in this review. I can't find the damned Spell Check."
1,Very disappointing,"I love historical fiction, and have avidly studied history. I do not mind when novels are historically inaccurate but my issue with this book is that it reads more like a history book than a novel. The characters are completely one dimensional even the main character, Eleanor. There is nothing new that I learned from this book, nor was there an attempt at explaining any of their motivations except to use the stereotypical Thomas of Lancaster was an evil bully, King Edward was weak and silly, and Queen Isabelle was the ""She-Wolf"".It made the entire time period, so rich with potential, dull! I actually had to stop reading this book because it really was poorly written without much imagination. Such wasted potential!I have followed Susan Higginbotham's blog and really was looking forward to this book. So disappointed and will not read anything by her again."
5,Definitely a good read,"Love the book. Love Elanor, love the drama, love the humor, love it. It is very well written and the historical setting makes it all the more interesting."
2,Couldnt't finish it,"I usually try to finish any book I read, and I just couldn't do it with this one. The story line was very sluggish and cumbersome. I hope I can pick it up and finish it one day (mainly because I hate to leave a book unread) but I'm not holding my breath. Good luck with this one."
2,too cumbursome,I usually love books of this genre and I looked forward to reading this. I stuck it out as long as I could but just got bogged down. I didn't finish it. Too bad. It should have been a good book.
1,Not for those who appreciate good historical fiction!,"I am so glad that I did not pay for this book! Though it contains the bulk of historical fact from the time period, that is the only positive thing I can say. The fiction part of the book is unbelievably juvenile, with characters making unlikely speeches and/or abruptly changing attitudes or personalities with no explanation. It seriously undermines the work and makes it intolerable to read through. I made it to the ""Eleanor sleeping with the King"" scene before I had to stop reading from pure disgust at the awfulness of the writing and lack of imagination/storytelling skills of the author. If you are a history or historical fiction buff, don't bother with this one!!"
1,Huh?,"I am so glad this book was free. At the same time, I am a little peeved that this book was recommended by Amazon. It's awful. I read 25% of it and haven't got a clue what was going on. I must be spoiled from Philippa Gregory. I don't understand how it got so many high ratings. I am amazed that a book about a king and his gay lover could bore me to death. I know Eleanor is the main character, but she's the dullest thing ever. Do not read this book unless you have insomia or you just feel like being confused."
2,Dark,I thought this story was very dark. It seemed to drag on and on. It was very hard to follow the characters as everyone had the same name and their names kept changing. I did not enjoy this book.
2,"Not worth it, and I got it for free","This story is different and that was the only good thing about it. I didn't really get the romance--- there were too many characters sleeping with one another. I understand the author was trying to be historically accurate, but it was boring and not a good book."
2,The Traitor's Wife....rather dull and awkward,"The Traitor's Wife by Susan Hugginbotham was, for the most part, dull and drab. While the characters were interesting, the way the plot is written drags. There is plenty of scandal. Between a king and his male lover, an incestuous relationship and a woman supposedly married to two men, readers will be left wondering how so much could happen to just one person.Lady Despenser, the main character, is portrayed as naive yet strong. She endures her various trials, yet turns a blind eye to the acts her husband commits.Overall, the book is readable, but not truly enjoyable."
5,The Traitor's Wife,This book was a little on the long side and very confusing with so many having the same name but I couldn't put it down. It was very enjoyable and interesting and when I finished it and found out that it was based on real people it was even better. Very good read.
4,Traitor's Wife,I enjoy Susan Higginbotham's writing. You need to be a history enthusiast to really get what it was like back in the 1800's or before. Susan uses real points of history on what happened but she adds fictious names to the characters and makes it seem like a novel. It gives an insight on how hard it was for the people who ruled to live a life without having an uprising and overrun you and your family.
1,Pretty bad,Boring...couldn't even finish it! I love historical fiction and have read nearly all of the Alison Weir books. Do not waste your money.
3,Didn't love it,"I have read much more entertaining historical fiction. At times, it seemed the book was listing details and fact versus telling a story. I finished it and was interested a good bit of the time, but would not recommend the book to a friend."
2,What book was I reading? Ugh...,"Clearly, I differ on opinion. I found the writing to be poor and confusing with so many of the same names, the tense jumping all around (in one paragraph you think you're in present tense while suddenly you're getting past backstory), the plot rather boring (granted I could only read 20% before I gave up)... I enjoy historical novels, but this one simply couldn't hold me. At least it was free."
2,Disappointing,"While I am a big fanatic of historical fiction novels, especially those set in this time period, I could not get through this book as hard as I tried. The writing was sad, almost as if an amateur wrote it. I like a novel that can transport me back in time, which this one did not. This is one book that I gave away, knowing that I would never pick it up again."
3,Ok but not my cup of tea,"Although Ms. Higginbotham takes liberties with historical facts and people, this was pretty ok. Some complain about the length of the novel but I am a fan of long books. I'm just not a fan of long books with often dragging chapters. I was also shocked about a particular scene in the novel. I can accept bi-sexuality acceptance among a husband and wife- esp. during these times where women, despite their ""independent"" nature, were still at the mercy of men. I just refuse to believe an uncle and niece would sleep together. I'm sorry that's just me. Although it's wasn't entirely romanticized (I refuse to look at those type of relationships as ""sexy"" no matter the flowerly language used)- it changed the novel. I've read quite a number of Ms. Higginbotham's books and enjoyed them but this one....eh"
5,The story moved right along. Great author.,Great story to help understand history. Author knows her history. It was hard not to read the whole story in one sitting.
3,Not your 'feel good' novel,"I must admit, this novel was very well researched and detailed. Perhaps a little TOO detailed for me. My head began to spin as new children and characters appeared on the scene with the same name...so many Edwards, Hughs, and even another Eleanor, not to mention Sir somebody who later became Earl of someplace. Although pretty enjoyable, my emotions were constantly up and then down throughout the book. Everything would seem fine for a few pages, then it was to the tower in the next few. One year everyone would have all their lands taken away and the next year their lands would be restored. I would expect a certain amount of land-grabbing and tower imprisonment, but in this book it was never ending. I marvel at how the heroine managed to bear 11 children through all of this!So many people seemed to really enjoy this book, but for those of us with simpler minds and tastes, it was somewhat disconcerting."
1,Yawn,"Too bad you can't give something zero stars. This was pure drivel. I enjoy historical fiction immensely and have no problems with homosexuality (as was well documented) but this book was terrible. I didn't finish it...I didn't even get halfway through it. Uninteresting, not entirely historically accurate, and extremely boring."
2,Disappointing,"This isn't a fully imagined and developed story of the people who lived in the described historical context. It is mainly a long recitation of events and people who were involved in those events without a fleshing-out of the people's characters or personal experiences. I really didn't care about any of the people portrayed or what happened to them, because none of them seemed like real people - only placeholders. Trying to figure out why I kept reading. Maybe stubbornness, which you will need to get through this."
2,just ok,"This book took me forever to get through. I do enjoy historical fiction, which is why I chose this book to begin with, and it seemed the author did her homework. However, the first half was so difficult to muddle through that I was very very close to drop it and stop reading. I found the writing did not flow. There were a lot of characters that seemed superfluous and all the similar names made it confusing to follow. I thought that her transition between events was choppy and many times I wondered why that section was in there in the first place. I enjoyed the last half better, as Eleanor was going through more events that made her character grow slightly, and as I didn't have to read about the King and Hugh moving from one place first, then another, and then another.This wouldn't be a book I'd re-read."
1,DID NOT FINISH IT - NOT A GOOD READ,"I love historical fiction like so many of us and was really looking forward to reading about a time and king that I knew little about. But this book turned out to be a thinly veiled, poorly written attempt to put sad, ineffectual characters in some kind of good light - it seemed the author worked way to hard to make Hugh's wife seem like not such an idiot and while I have no qualms about homesexuality, there was so much in the first part of the book it made me not want to continue. None of the characters were believable or endearing which made the history in the book uninteresting. I sure hope there was never a female really as blindly stupid as Hugh's wife. I was very sad, I so wanted to like this one."
1,never recieved it,"Don't buy from this company! It lists this item in stock, but it is most deinetly NOT. I canceled my order after a month of waiting. The low price is not worth it when you are waiting on your child's first birthday present."
4,The Opal Seekers,Was an eye opener into life in the tough times of mining in the outback. Was a good read and it was recommended to me and I have since urged others to read it
1,Please get back to basics,"Are you kidding? This is Nils at his worst. I have been a Nils fan for a very long time, and this album is just ""not Nils"". It's like he experimented in something new and it didn't quite work out. He is so much better than this, and he has so much more to offer. I have been waiting for new material for so long (preferably with a full band), and this was really a disappointment. I really hope he gets back to basics soon."
5,Truly Hilarious,"The Gilbert Gnarley (G-N-A-R L-E-Y) albums are downright hillarious with. It is basically an old man doing a bunch of phone pranks. Kind of like Jerky Boys, but without the R rating. I laughed my butt off listening to both this and the other Gilbert Gnarley tape."
1,NASTY DOESNT EVEN BEGIN TO DESCRIBE THIS PRODUCT !,I tried the strawberry one and it was so miserable in taste that I threw my drink out after 2 sips. Amazon was gracious enough to give me a postage paid label for a complete refund. A waste of time ...this product should not be sold ANYWHERE
4,Great budget speakers!,"These speakers provide excellent sound for under $50. A couple years ago, this set was one of the best you could buy and came highly recommended by many of the gaming sites I visited for comparison shopping. I have recently purchased a system that's completely top-notch with a Ghz processor and needed a great set of speakers for a low price. These perform beyond my expectations.I haven't had any problems with radio interferance, but as a few others have reported the problem it's something to keep in mind. Also, the bass isn't the best, but for everyday uses such as watching DVD movies, playing games, and listening to music (which I do for hours daily) these speakers do a fine job. I personally love the sound quality coming from such small speakers, and for this price you won't find anything this good."
5,Wow! What Incredible Sound!,"I can't believe the power in this little package. I am so impressed. I didn't believe that something could top my Altec Lansing Speaker System, but this blows the doors off of it. I recommend this little system to anyone."
4,3+ years and still going strong,"...not very loud, and the sub tends to get boomy. other than that, best sound for the money(still is). perfect ""hi-fi"" for a student living in a dorm...took it to a friend's home with a portable cd player. my friend laughed at my portable gimmicky stereo at first. they weren't laughing anymore when they heard it playing."
2,"The old saying goes,you get what you pay for...","I ordered this speaker system to replace a terrible pair that came with my computer. I figured anything would be better. Well,these are better sounding,but just added new problems. First off,I knew these would not be audiophile quality,but the first MP3 I put on to test them,showed the subwoofer can not handle much bass. It was popping with the volume low. Terrible. The other problem I had,is the volume control. I can deal with the stupid design,but it has a short in it,and I have to keep wiggling it to get sound from both satellites. If you are looking for just a cheap pair of speakers,these are the ones to get. For the price I paid,it is not really worth the time and effort to mail em back,etc.. I'll just have to deal with new problems after dealing with the old ones.. I'd shop around."
2,Good sound ruined by radio interference.,"Like some of the other reviewers, I have had serious radio interference with these speakers which basically makes them unusable. Granted, I live on an upper floor in an apartment building in the city, but still, I haven't had this kind of trouble with any of the other speakers I've used previously with my computer. Basically, this unit has too many cables, they are too long, and -- most importantly -- they are poorly shielded. Also, they are hard wired into the unit so you can't substitute your own. This seems like a silly place to cut corners. I'm going to take these back to the store and try something else."
4,"SoundWorks, Good quality for a low price","After comparing sound quality in many computer speaker systems at an electronic retail store, I purchased the Cambridge Sound Works 100PC system. In the price range that I was considering, these speakers actually sounded as good as the more expensive Yamaha speakers and only slightly less powerful than the much more expensive Altec Lansing system. At home the CSW100PC performs even better than in the store where accustics leave much to be desired. Disappointed I am NOT in these little beauties.The Subwoofer provides ample power and limited distortion at all but the highest levels, and the matching of Subwoofer to sattelite speakers is flawless in my environment. I placed the subwoofer on a stand up off the floor to limit vibration and distortion. In my opinion, the CSW100PC can't be beat by anything in it's price range, and by most in a higher price range. **** It's a keeper.****"
2,Too many wires makes for a good radio antenna...,"As soon as I plugged in the speaker system, I heard a radio station playing loud and clear, unaffected by the volume control or whether the speakers were connected to the computer. It is not even a station I like! The tech people sent many suggestions, none of which have helped. Essentially, there are too many wires, as the volume control has a seperate loop all to itself (as opposed to being part of one of the speakers). Too bad, because the sound is excellent for the price. Unfortunately, it has to compete with a loud, scratchy radio signal which ruins the effect. The tech support people seemed to know about this - makes one wonder..."
1,Don't buy these speakers!,"Everytime the speakers are plugged in and the power is on, I pick up distortion -either a small crackling sound or a low level radio signal. So anytime I play stuff with these speakers, I can still hear that low level sound. I had to completely disconnect the left speaker because it was picking up a radio station even when the volume was at its lowest. These speakers are NOT Cambridge Soundworks quality. If you want good speakers, its worth spending the extra bucks to get real sound."
3,black menace huh!,This is not a typical black menace album. J Dawg his lost the energy he use to project and Threat just doesn't shine. The music is lacking and needs a lot of work. These boys need to go back to Precise or call Mannie to bail them out.
3,A decent book......,"I was walking around the bookstore when I came across this book. The title itself sounded interesting. I started to read the first chapter and was taken with Jane Ingelby, her character and her witty comments. Both heroine and hero were wonderful characters. I decided to buy the book. I've read one of Balogh's short regency story before and enjoyed it immensely. I was into this book, it took me less than two days to read it. It made me laugh and cry. The book was wonderful but the ending......oh..what a disappointment. I was very frustrated by it......so I give it a three."
5,Wow! What a treasure,"Within the first 20 pages, I fell in love with these funny, smart, brave, and wonderfully flawed human beings. I started Balogh by reading the Bedwyn series and Summer to Remember, which I thought could not be bested. How wrong I was. The very best of Regency writing that writes according to speech, manners and social attitudes of the day without having stereotyped bodice ripping characters who do no more than say ""by god"", ""my god"", or ""oh god"". Of course, now I feel dreadfully cheated that the Bedwyn series aren't up to par with this story."
3,So so,"I choose this book because of the narrator. I need something to listen to while at work and I'm a big fan of this particular narrator. She's usually really good at male's voice but not in this book. I was quite disappointed. However, the story was OK. Quite slow at the beginning. Could be because was listening to the Audio and I just couldn't fall in love with the hero. I like the narrator in Lisa Kleypas's books... thought I try it with Mary Balogh but I'm nit a fan. Aside from the narrator, the hero and heroine in this book was a little annoying but I began to fall in love with them as the story unfold. A good read. Or LISTEN."
2,Still waiting,"I bought this novel in the same book as 'No Man's Mistress', and let's just say i'ts going to take alot for me to get to THAT story. I couldn't find anything to like about ANY of the characters in this book - they were all just blahh... I found myself skimming the pages at the end of the book because it was just silly. Now i'm all one for the big drama at the end - hero feels betrayed, mentally hurts the heroine, hero begs for forgiveness, heroine makes him sweat.... then happily ever after... but it just didn't feel heartfelt, like it was written without any thought... Makes me wonder if I read the same book as everyone else. - My verdict... don't bother!"
2,Regency ...,"The story is interesting, recommended if you LOVE regency or this author. I just found it to be typical regency.When the couple got together they were corny. The 1st love scene was so tacky -- with paragraphs of dialogue and mumbo jumbo breaking up the lovemaking. And the name Jocelyn (Jocelyn!!?) The sexy plot was there, it just didn't move."
2,review of Mary Balogh's MORE THAN A MISTRISS,"I started this wonderfully written book having read a very positive review on the Romance Reader website and was immediately put off by the desparate, powerless woman with no money or means dealing with a rich powerful male storyline. I kept reading because of the engaging writing and character development, yet when the main feminine character abjectly prostituted herself,I bailed. Mary Jane Krentz is an example of an author writing about women and men dealing from strength with the same wonderful chemistry that Ms. Balogh's characters so ably depict. I cannot recommend this book."
1,is it over yet?,"MORE THAN A MISTRESS left me turning pages as quickly as i could to just get it over with. though jane was a likeable character, i couldn't connect with or warm up to jocelyn. i didn't feel that joecelyn was ever deserving of jane. he was crude, pompous, and fickle. who wants that in a man?if you are looking for a book with some trashy sex scenes, this could be the one for you. if you are looking for a sweet romance, try mary balogh's ONE NIGHT FOR LOVE"
4,Different approach to romance,"I liked this book. I know many won't, but I think it all depends on what you look for in a romance that determines whether you like it or not. This book took a different approach to romance and I liked it because she was able to do it well. The roles were reversed and believable that is something that is hard for some authors to do, but she was able to pull it off. I just love books that tug at my heart strings and this one certainly did."
4,nice,i loved this bookit made me laugh so hardat first i didn't like the hero but then he grew on me except for that looking glass that the auther kept mentioningi got so annoyedbut all in all great read
5,Great filter for percolators,We have a Farberware percolator and have found these filter to be the best to keep grounds out of the coffee. Use them once or twice a day.
1,NOT good in presto percolator,"I tried using these filters in a Presto percolator. Even with less coffee, only 4 scoops, the brew basket overflowed and washed a lot of the grounds out the top. With other pots they may work but not the Presto 12 cup. Too bad - the wrap around filters are a pain.Amazon only sent 1 pack of 100 filters. When notified they refunded the money for the filters they didn't send. This worked out in my favor because of the above. I am glad I don't have 2400 filters that don't work in the pot - 100 is plenty. I bought so many because a friend, who must have a very different percolator said they work for him. He almost got 2300 filters for Christmas!"
5,Filters,Still enjoy coffee from a perculator and the filters this size have been getting harder and harder to find with all the newer coffee makers on the market. Will last me forever!
5,Lifetime supply of filters,"There's not much to say - they are coffee filters... Been using a Melita electric percolator for fifteen years and my stores no longer carry the filters; this box ought to outlast the coffee maker. :) Seriously - 2400 filters is a lot, but they don't go bad or anything. I just tucked the box (approx 10"" square) in the back of the pantry.For best results, put a filter in the basket and then wet it down before adding coffee grounds. Dump into the compost bin when done.Arrived quickly, exactly as advertised."
3,Coffee Filters,You can not use these for perculated coffee makers.They block the drainage(drip)and you end up with grinds in the coffee..
1,coffee filter for a perculator??,This product is worthless and overpriced. Don't bother. I think I used one filter before I shuffled them to the back of the cupboard.
5,wher is the filter,"This item could not be found in Baker City Oregon, La Grande Oregon, or Ontario Oregon. I went to Albertsons, Safeway, Wal-mart, Bi-Mart. and Rite Aid. The Item could not be found. Thank God and Al Gore for the internet."
3,Stop the presses: make your own on the cheap,"I make my own percolator filters and they work fine. And mine are dirt cheap.I simply buy a stack of normal basket-type filters at the grocery store. When I get home, I clamp the stack of filters tightly together and, using a Forstner bit, I drill a 3/8 inch hole through the center of the whole stack. I suppose a normal drill bit would work, but I've never tried that.A few filters on the top of the stack tend to get ripped up, but that's not a big deal.The filter with the hole in the center nestles nicely into the moistened perc basket and the lid fits on top like it normally does. This method stops 99% of the mud from getting into my coffee and makes cleaning out the perc basket a breeze.I used to make the hole each morning in the basket filter using a single-hole paper punch, but that got a little tedious."
4,limited prospects,"As the Vietnam War was ongoing, Hickey was able to conduct an intensive study of a village in the south. He gives the reader an appreciation of the rural culture then prevalent. By looking at such issues like the kinship relations between villagers. And the various livelihoods possible in the village.In today's Vietnam, some of these observations are probably still accurate. But reading the book, the reader might be struck by the poverty of village life. Very limited education was available for people to better themselves. And even with an education, there was little to apply it to in situ."
4,Perry Mason in fine form,"One of Earl Stanley Gardner's less formulaic efforts in the Perry Mason series, this one has an ending that should surprise TV fans who think the killer always confesses in the end. The story features diamond smugglers, a con artist, a voyeur hiding in closets watching beautiful women bathe, and of course, Mason, Della Street, and Paul Drake forming an unbeatable trio."
3,Pretty good whodunnit.,"This one isn't Perry Mason's most riveting case, but the unlikely opening gambit of an [unclothed] ghost in the park hooks the reader quickly, and as with most of Gardner's books the surprises come fast and furious. I figured out most of the case (for a change) before Perry unraveled the rest of it for me. If you have an hour to while away on a plane or a beach or just over lunch, this book is an enjoyable, though not brilliant, companion."
4,Of course the lawyer doesn't like it,"Delaney is a sociologist not a lawyer! This is done through a sociological perspective meaning it is intended as something of an exposee not the ""How-To"" guide that the lawyer was looking for. The point of the book is to show how corporations use bankruptcy to their own ends, i.e. escape liability and court ordered settlements."
2,Tiresome Reading,"This entire book could have been written in one chapter or less. Unfortunately the author uses repetition to drive home a point which could have been easily deduced from reading the title of the book. Each example is portrayed as a deviously crafted plot by either management, the banks or both to deliberately enter into the 'safe haven' of the Bankruptcy Courts. No regard was given to the high probability that each of the companies would not have survived as a going concern. In fact the author offers up economically impractical solutions that each company could have implemented to avoid bankruptcy. On the plus side, the middle three chapters offer a good historic overview of the Texaco, John Manville and Continental filings."
1,Don't Bother,"The author should have stuck with sociology or at least taken an accounting class before writing this book. Overall, the book is what you would expect from a sociologist writing about business."
1,"Poor taste, at Christmas","This has a very dubious moral. If you give away your goods to the poor, they will be magically renewed. And as long as there are presents to open, Granny dieing matters not at all. The children (anyway in the Australian edition) seem much more interested in the presents than in poor dead Gran. One wonders why the Christ Child did not do his miracle by giving presents to all the poor children directly? This is almost the only picture book with a corpse in. The only other one I can think of is My Dog by John Heffernan and Andrew McClean - much more sensatively treated! As the writer of the editorial review, I think it ""failed"" badly - I certainly wouldn't read it to my chldren!"
5,Everything You Need to Get Started,This is a wonderful way to introduce younger students to a 'real' dictionary. Words are clearly separated with three columns on each page. The word itself is written in blue ink with the definition in black ink. The pictures are simple but appealing. There are several pages of interesting information at the back of the book including a section on measurement and one on the origins of the names of individual U.S. states. This is the perfect tool for middle elementary classrooms and/or students.
4,"Great music, what is it?",I love the music on this cd. The back cover lists the music and track but lists them in a different order than they are played. If the literature were printed correctly then this would be a five star product.
2,Far too much hiss,"I bought the SBS20 speakers for use with headphones at work because these are among the few inexpensive speakers that have separate bass and treble controls.I'm sorry to say these will be going back, because there is a considerable amount of background noise (hissing). The Harman/Kardon cheapos that the PC came with don't have any hissing at all, but unfortunately they don't have bass control.Cambridge Soundworks: Add a simple high pass filter and these speakers would be fine."
2,dude...come on,who the hell still buys 2.0 systems for there computer..get a sub! check out the logitech systems. you cant go wrong with them.
4,Okay....But not a 10,"With classical music it is hard to listen to a 30 second preview to decide if it is performed well. This is a Chinese Classic performed by a Japanese artist and falls a little short on a scale of 1-10 it is maybe a 7 or 8. The problem lies mainly in the featured violinists performance. Best performance is done by Lu Siqing, however I have not found that CD. Listen to performance excerpts on u tube and you will see what I mean."
3,Beautiful and what a bargain,It's based on a Chinese Romeo and Juliette story and musically is a blend of East and West. I have purchased probably a half a dozen of this CD and given them as gifts--my favorite is as a wedding gift. I have never done this with any other musical piece.
4,Guide book for everyone,"This is a guide book, almost a dictionary for those interested in obtaining more information regarding drug prevention and drug use and how to deal with it.It is an easy to read and follow book with understandable small chapters that answer your questions on drug abuse and prevention.Even if there is not a problem at home with this issue, it should be read to hopefully prevent it from happening. The best thing is that it explains and also gives short examples so understanding is easier.I will re-read it again and again to put its recommendations into practice at home."
4,very good buy for the money,"I was running stock speakers on my computer and decided to give theses a try. I am very satisfied. The Bass isn't deep but there is a definate difference for the better. Music sounds a lot better and games are a lot cooler now. For the money you can't go wrong. Took all of 2 minutes to hook up and get going. Very satisfied and would definatley reccomend for anyone who does not want to spend a lot and still get some bass. I also get better ""highs"" from the small speakers than I did than with my old ones."
2,Replacement speakers still BUZZZZZZZING!@#$@!!%^!,"I had these speakers replaced because of the irritating buzzing sound emenating from the woofer. The replacement set still ""buzzes"" continuously. I have to turn them off when they're not in use so the sound doesn't drive me crazy. I'll just cut my losses and get something else. Don't buy these speakers!"
2,BUZZZZZZZZZ too!!!,"It seems like there's a bad batch of these speakers going around. This probably accounts for the slashed price. I get a constant BUZZZING sound coming from the subwoofer/amp. I've been able to reduce the noise by fiddling with the bass adjustment but this doesn't completely eliminate this annoyance. Unlike with another reviewer this problem is unlikely to be fixed by adjusting my sound card properties since it BUZZES even when I disconnect the speakers from the sound card output. Otherwise, the sound is acceptable although it is a little ""tin-cannish"". My previous $50 labtec speakers had much better sound quality and were more attractive. What do you expect for 28 bucks?"
4,Great for price,This product has done me well. I am heavy into speakers at my house. With a little adjusting they sound very clear and the bass is smooth and loud. I would strongly suggest these for music and some games. definately better than most other sub and satelite sets!
2,Too bad it was just a raw gem...,"I liked the idea of a decoy princess with some magical powers, and a giant game of chess with live persons used as pawns...That's what kept me reading the whole book, and also the sequel ""Princess at sea""... The plot seemed all right, and I just kept looking for better... And I didn't get it... Something was missing... Too much of Tess's complicated love life and whining about her being a decoy, and not enough of the bigger play! It was much more like a harlequin romance than a fantasy book!The 2 books are entertaining though, if you have lots of free time, and nothing else to read, it will pass time agreeably, but it's not exactly memorable..."
3,Just didn't hit the spot,"I liked the book and the story, but something was lacking for me. If you really want a good Dawn Cook read the Truth series is Great! This one just missed and I didn't even want to read the sequel. 14 and up"
4,fun read,"This was a nice fun read that is perfect for the beach or ski vacation. This is not a deep book, the author keeps stuff pretty light, but what it lacks in substance it makes up for in charm. Fortune tellers, fake princesses and real princesses, intrigue, murder, and a touch of magic makes this a compelling read. I can't wait to read the next book in the series!"
4,Fisrt book in series,"After reading [...] First Truth Series [...], and being addicted to her 'Hollows' books, I picked up Decoy Princess with anticipation. I found it to be a very slow developing book, with lots of complicated side plots throughout the book, but the reward is well fleshed out characters, and an interesting new universe to explore. Like the First Truth series, this is a juvenile fantasy series, but it will reward all readers with a very satisfying story. I give it a 4 because of the slow development, but it seems like a very healthy start to what should be a very fascinating new world. I hope her promise of a close exploration of this world's politics is fullfilled."
4,A pretty good read,"I must admit going into this book with low expectations and was pleasantly surprised that it was not as shallow as I would've thought. There is good meat to the story and has a nice, ""strong woman"" vibe."
3,Real is Better!,"NovaMenco's new CD Fortune Teller sounds very clean, too clean. They should have stayed with a real drummer on this one.Digital percussion just does'nt mix with nice acoustic guitar's! Good stuff here, but, I feel real drums would compliment their music much much better!!!"
5,Music That Lifts Your Spirit,"I was Reading Sunday's Union Tribune ""current section"" Article ""A weight Lifted"" which has mentioned NovaMenco's Music. And how it made Marcella Johnson the poor Woman who had lost her baby due to ""Ostteogenesis Imperfecta Type II"" Feel That her baby was Alife Whenever she played NovaMenco's music. I crried for the loss of the baby, but at the same time I went out to the nearest music store and purchased NovaMenco's New CD ""fortune teller"" and have been listening to it every day. I have recommended NovaMenco""s music to all my friends, becuse, it is a spirit lifting music."
5,very pleased,I fond this cook book so close to our family way of cooking that i will give it as gifts in the future
2,Myths Just Aren't Enough,"The Mermaids Singing had so much promise. The author is a poet at heart, using language skillfully, but needs help in character development. It was really hard to see where one character ended and another began. Grace and Grainne were so focused on sex that their lives became meaningless and self-centered. The images of the sea and mermaids was beautifully done, but one wonders why the author didn't take more time in adding depth to the characters so that they were believable. The book did not live up to its promise, even with all the lovely images."
5,What a great story!,"I bought this book simply because the cover caught my eye, and I am glad I bought it! I found this novel beautiful, funny, and a definite page turner. I was so caught up in the suspense of where her father was I didn't want to quit reading. Just a great book. Can't wait for more from Lisa Carey!"
5,This book is very emotional!,"I've read this book nearly two years ago and it's one that has really affected me. It's sad and depressing, but you feel like you actually know the characters and what they are feeling. I like how the points-of-view of each of the women are shown."
3,Interesting story,"I have mixed feelings about this family saga which is both heartbreaking and heartwarming. The inner healing, reaching out and reconciliation between Cliona and her granddaughter Grainne, and the rest of their family, following the death of Grace, was tragically beautiful. And the harsh island setting and Irish folklore was very interesting. However, this family was far too dysfunctional and the characters were way too sexually preoccupied for my tastes, and that took away from my feelings towards them and towards this story."
5,This is truly an amazing book!,"A friend recommended this book to me, and I was VERY glad she did! I am normally not very interested in ""generational"" type novels- but the complex story line, combined with the beautifully written portrayals of each of the women pulled me right into this tale. It was a definite ""don't turn out the light until you are finished book"", and after reading I felt as if I had been there to see, feel and taste the tragedies and joys of each of the characters. This is one of those novels that remains with you after you put it down, and leaves you feeling full and satiated. What a treat, and what a surprise! I highly recommend this book, and it has changed my narrow views about this type of novel."
2,Much promise big let down,"I wanted so much to like this book. I love stories about Ireland, but this book and its characters gave very little to like. It is a story of mother and daughter and grandmother, but what a horrible tale. I see no real need to read this unless you have nothing better to do than being dissappointed."
3,Good Fluff,"The generational story of Cliona, Grace and Grainne is intertwined with Irish lore and mother-daughter strife. The character development is poor, save Cliona. We never really discover Grace and Grainne's motivations. The story pushes us too fast. The book ends when it just really gets started. Overall, it's a good story in an excellent setting.This is an excellent beach book. It just could have been more."
4,"A book for all grandmother, mothers and daughters alike!","Certainly one of the best books I've read. I was just browsing through the bookstore when the paperback cover caught my attention. I must admit I'm easily persuaded into buying books when I like the cover of the book itself. Starting from day one till I finished the book, I wasn't a bit sorry I bought it! I am anxiously waiting for Lisa Carey's next novel!"
3,Good first book,"The book was entertaining, but not great. After reading Lisa Carey's most recent book, Every Visible Thing, -- which I loved -- I was excited to read more of her work. The Mermaids Singing was obviously her first attempt at a published novel and certainly not up to par with her talent now. It's an easy read with a nice twist on making mythical ideas an acceptable reality."
2,kept me wanting to read but author's writing too cheesey.,"this book is more like a what i would expect a harliquin romance to be like--maybe slightly a notch above. if you are a reader that enjoys that kind of book then you'll love mermaids singing. the author's development of characters is weak with exception of cliona. i couldn't figure out why grace and her daughter had such a sex problem. it really gets to the point of being ridiculous--- the word ""slut"" began to pop up in my mind as the book went on.don't get me wrong...i think sex adds tremendously to a book, but lines like ""his lips were warm and tasted like oil and salt and fish"" and ""Liam trying to look apologetic while holding his hands over his groin and licking his swollen, delicious lips""....made me wonder why i was reading this book. also, the way grainne just snapped out of her eating disorder was totally unrealistic. i couldn't get a picture of such a sick and emaciated (not to mention the chopped off hair) being so sexual."
1,Ungrateful Grace,"The character Grace ruined this book. She seemed mentally ill to me. She was so unbelievably selfish, self-centered, unappreciative. What did her mother do to deserve such treatment?"
3,Compelling reading,"This book is certainly a page-turner. It was difficult to put it down. I enjoyed reading the stories of each of the three women. Like other reviewers--I found the character of Grace to be incredibly frustrating and selfish. It was just not clear to me why she made the choices she did--whatever the inadequacies her mother(Cliona) may have had. I'm not happy with the ending, either. It may have been a 'happy' one, but is it the best for Grainne? If she becomes involved with Liam, I can only see this as a poor choice for her. I just have visions of the cycle being repeated once again...All in all--it was enjoyable reading, but it seemed a little pretentious and overdone to me."
5,pyrometer,Works great...another example of you get what you pay for. Tried a cheap one first. Didn't work. This one did.
5,Fantastic,"This CD is really wonderful. It's an incredible variety of new music of different styles, but I found ""wissahickon poeTrees"" to be a fantastic and engaging piece. If you aren't sure you like new music, check out the Wissahickon piece...you'll like this a lot-it's real music! The performances are first rate as well. I cannot recommend this disc enough...it's a must have!"
2,"""...and they stole a crooked setting.""","What we have here is the setting, first conceived by him, of Robert A. Heinlein's short story ""...and he built a crooked house"", without proper credit, and with malevolence towards those caught in it, unlike Heinlein's otherwise benign setting.Unpleasant people (who should have had more smarts than they did considering their described backgrounds) trapped in a difficult setting, with ""sci-fi"" effects, a ""Ten Little Indians"" plot, and an ""X-Files"" ending. Worth watching once just to see Heinlein's Crooked House realized on screen."
3,Chinese puzzle box with people inside,"""The question is did he solve it, before he died?""The idea is to connect up a five dimensional space timewith doors in the six sides of each cube.Putting people in as rats in the maze is a sort ofinhumanity twist ( specially the old lady with Alzheimer's disease and the blind girl). An older version ""pre"" the first sequel exists from the 60'sI think. So the movie is a remake of an old sci fi filmjazzed but to make it harder...The reality collapse of the in-folding of the cubes toward the end ofthe cycle leads to ...."
2,You Know What They Say About Sequels...,"The first ""Cube"" was a fine sci-fi movie with a witty concept and an interesting execution. Its sequel recaptures some ideas from the original but this time we`re in for a bigger,louder and more sophisticated experience. While it seems that the producers wasted more money here than in the first, the overall result isn`t as exciting. The first one had a claustrophobic atmosphere, yet ""Hypercube"" doesn`t have that same feel and mood and ends up being less suspenseful and gripping. The characters are stereotypes and don`t make us care much, and a couple of twists in the plot are quite questionable. All in all, not a terrible and lifeless sequel, but not a particularly exciting one, either. It`s a somewhat entertaining piece of sci-fi, even if it doesn`t bring nothing all that new or unpredictable.Average, worth watching once."
3,No more suspense...,"Do not expect any suspense or horror from this movie. You will mostly find discussions on math, physics, and multiple/parallel dimensions. There are only a few traps that are followed with long pauses where the characters try to figure out everything. And most of the characters are copies from the first Cube, like the guy that goes crazy and kills everyone.The graphics were kind of embarassing to watch, the acting was pretty good, and the ending was a setup for a third cube, but what this movie needed was more traps and more excitement. It even seemed that the characters were bored in this movie at some points!Overall, a pretty good movie. You just have to make yourself get into these mathematical discussions the characters have. There just wasn't any suspense when they moved from room to room that the first Cube had. They should have had the first director do this film!"
3,hmmm...,"in-ter-es-ting and od. a few good twists like someone mentioned people that were dead came back, but its made to confuse you but you can still follow the plot. mediocr movie. wouldn't see it twice. only saw it cause of geraint wyn davies, im a forever knight fan. i would suggest watching it on tv or renting it, not buying it.overall not bad, i think. good if you like seeing GWD go insane :P"
2,"The First One Was Great, But The Sequel, Like Most....","I am a huge fan of the original Cube movie. When I found out they had made a sequel, I rented it as soon as a copy was available. Very quickly into the movie I was thinking, alright... its much like the first movie, maybe it will be just as good if not better. It certainly has a better production value.This movie just didn't pull it off. The first one was all about people, not the characters. It had no star or hero. It was simply a story about the interaction of humans with eachother in a stressful situation.This movie is all about the conspiracy theory, X-files style, and its weak. Go watch The Original Cube, and watch some old X-files episodes. You'll be much happier in the end."
3,"Not as good as the first, but engaging nonetheless...","After seeing the first one, I went out and rented this one. I wasn't too dissapointed, but I wasn't too thrilled with it either. Basically the same premise with a whole bunch of new twists and characters. It's good enough to keep you interested, and the writing isn't too bad. There are some plot holes here and there, and plenty of cheesy special effects, but it was good. I am still trying to decide whether I liked the ending or not. Other than that...Recommended!"
1,I can't believe I wasted my time on this!!!,"I can't believe I watched this piece of [stuff] for two hours only to have the most intelligent character shot (as in MURDERED) by the military at the very end. Excuse me, but what is the 'freakin' point? Other than this 'minor point', I found the oriental woman to be more than annoying throughout the entire film... annoying, pretentious, oh! maybe she was supposed to be an archetype for Yoko Ono!Maybe I was supposed to have seen the first film, but more than maybe this one just [smells.]For future reference to the director and producers of this film:you need a PLOT *and* GOOD CHARACTERS to create an environment where people *ACTUALLY* care about the people in the film. Special effects alone (and they *were* more than acceptable) can NOT save a film.Take a pass on this..."
3,very interesting plot semi so so execution,liek saw cube has an oustanding presmie but liek saw it also fails mostly to make good on the surrounding executionthe ideas are awesomebe fun to see a bigger budget rendition
2,Really very poor follow-up to the original CUBE.,"CUBE (the original) is fantastic, but CUBE 2: HYPERCUBE just doesn't measure up at all. Dont bother with this one, just watch the original classic instead for a good horror/sci-fi thriller..."
2,Hypercube,"Not nearly as good as the first Cube. There was no fear, or suspense. Pretty much a repeat of the first characters, but boring. It tries to go far graphically, but unfortunately the plot and logic of the film don't go far at all. Instead of focusing on the danger of the cube and ways to escape, most of the movie is spent trying explain theoretical math in lay terms and discussing characters viewers have never heard about..."
1,2 hours of my life lost to the hyperdimensions forever!,"Preface: I have not seen The Cube.Body: This was the most dreadful waste of 2 hours of my life next to be being snowed into Chicago O'Hare for a day. The bad acting can be forgiven. It's a B movie. Ditto the dialogue. But c'mon, 2 hours without a set change? Yawn. This movie is not so nearly as clever as it would like to think. The Hypercube idea has lots of potential, all wasted. The movie makes no sense. We learn:A)Everyone who is in the Cube had something to do with it's making.b)The Cube kills you.So what?Conclusion: Go read Alastair Reynold's Diamond Dogs and give up movies entirely. If you insisnt on brainless tripe, see the original 1970s Phantasm, or even Zardoz, they're a lot cooler."
1,HyperDud,"This movie sets out to answer questions left from the original, but only throws you scraps. About the only answer we get is the name of the company behind the experiment.The original had graphic gore scenes that have become classic and reproduced in newer films, where this one does not even attempt to impress us with any such scenes. They have pretty much skewered the first films plot and candy coated it into this slop.As a horror fan, i am dissapointed. As a sci-fi fan, i am unimpressed. If the rumors of a third film come true, lets pray they try and raise the bar."
1,Worst Movie EVER,"What was the point to this movie? Everbody dies. In this movie, a group of people are trapped in a hypercube (as if it can be physically constructed with current technology), trying to find a way out of the cube. This movie had unknown actors, bad acting, and a pointless ending. The paltry special effects could not have saved this movie. I would rank this movie down there with other recent duds like Battlefield Earth."
3,"Not like the first, but okay.","I now have Cube 1, 2, and 3. The 1st and 3rd are the best, the 2nd is okay but not as intense or real looking as the others - to much computer work. All and all though a good night time Sci-Fi to enjoy.Thomas"
3,Silly.,"i gave this movie three stars only because of the science that was explained behind the cube being a tesseract. It is akin to quantum physics/mechanics and actually represents possibilities of how the universe is formed on a larger scale. Black holes being the virtual doorways and each universe having different laws and so forth.Cube1 and Cube Zero had darker themes. This similar setting would have helped this movie to be more enjoyable. there are very few movies I find to be a waste of time. This one is one of them.Watch once for the science, and then use as a coaster."
1,Just Say No,"I am writing this over a year after actually seeing CUBE 2: HYPERCUBE, because it was the first time I could stomach to remember it. I am a hard core indie-scifi freak (well any good scifi really) and I must say this movie was a train wreck. I couldn't believe the film makers sheer lack of understanding as to what made the original CUBE great- all white rooms, street clothes, time traveling canabal, I'm saying. I considered CUBE to be up there with the greats (Donnie Darko, Dark City, blah blah blah), CUBE 2 just cheapened it. If you really need more Cubedom see CUBE ZERO the prequel tney recently made, it's at least decent. But to this monstrousity just say no!"
3,"It's not THAT bad, really,","I have to admit, that I have liked the first Cube more, this one was still a fun/weird movie to watch. It's just a completly different movie genre than many people are used to.A survivor, lost people story that isn't happening in the woods but in a game/trap world. This Cube is much more advanced, with mostly CG effects that are the killing traps, and it gets confusing when the gravity, time and dimentions collapse into one another.I didnt mind the ending really, I dont always need all the answers on a silver platter in order to enjoy a movie. It's not just about the end, it's about everything you experience watching it.Overall, this is more modern, fast and graphic, the Cube is white inside, and the doors open with a touch of a palm. It feels like a big square spaceship, where as the original Cube felt more like an ancient creation."
4,"If you're a Metallica fan at all, at least give it a listen.","I really really like this. Tres cool. To disagree with the other fans of the album, I'd have to say the best track is a tie between the two Razed in Black covers (yeah, I'm a die-hard RiB fan, but songs like this are the reason), with Thing That Should Not Be probably edging out the lead. They all just sound awesome. I hate the original version of Wherever I May Roam, but I think it actually sounds fairly good on here. The Die Krupps cover also sounds pretty decent, and I must admit that For Whom the Bell Tolls does please my senses a fair amount. All in all, worth the cash, and give it a chance. And a quick note to all those who loathed this: if you want your Metallica to sound just like the original, why are you buying cover albums anyway?"
4,A great CD...just different,This CD is really cool...you have to really like Metal to like it though. I enjoyed it...a recomendation to all who like Mettalica
1,Horrid!,I am a HUGE industrial fan and an above average Metallica fan. I was really expecting to find a great album that mixed Metallica's awesome lyrics with some very cool modern industrial. Instead you get an album that that doesn't cross the industrial line at all. Techno at best and that isn't even with all the songs. Some are funk... others are just rock. Listening to both 1 and 2 only made me want to return the CD's and put in some older metallica. Steer clear!!! 0 stars if allowed.
1,This...,"This album.... I bought it expecting to find Metallica songs, but instead I hear funky... that some no-name bands wrote. These songs are mere imitations, and bad ones at that, of the great legend Metallica. Do yourself a favor and do not buy this album. You'll save yourself a lot of money."
1,crap,"Please do not buy any of the tributes to Metallica. They are all the most blasphemous sorry excuses for Metallica covers. Hardly any of them remotely sound like the originals. If you want to listen to Metallica music, then buy only Metallica music written and performed by Metallica themselves."
3,Overall good album,"This is good overall but with only a few standout songs. In my opinion, the last song ""Battery"" is the best of all, but is closer to rave then industrial. On the downside, there seems to be a few too many songs that are simply the originals with a new backbeat and more distortion. I recommend this album to anyone who enjoys Metallica, or is a fan of industrial music."
4,Whiplash,"The song Whiplash is not from Metallica there. Abaddon is an interpreter of the song. It means 07. Abaddon - Whiplash is correct. The CD costs 2.5 USD (48 CZK) in Czechia, Europe now. It is a real bargain."
4,"not industrial, not metallica","when i was about 10 i heard that metallica were cool, so i went and bought this album, thinking it was metallica originals. i loved it. i later heard some real metallica and was somewhat dissapointed. i have also since heard many other tracks from the artists featured on this album. i prefer this cover album to original metallica, and i prefer this cover album to anything else the artists featured have done (except perhaps razed in black). unfortunately, i have not found anything quite as dark yet good as this."
3,wouldn't buy these again,I would not buy these batteries again. They swelled up and don't hold a charge after a short time.
1,This is NOT an Olympus brand battery!!,The battery probably works fine however SF Planet is not selling Olympus brand. They acknowledged the fact when I contacted them after receiving the battery
1,"Complete Waste of Time and Money, Dead on Arrival","It looks like a battery, but it's not. Arrived defective. It wouldn't charge. What a waste of time to order it. And a waste of money for shipping. I sent it back. Do not buy from this provider. Look at the reviews. There are many similar experiences. I wonder who writes the positive reviews, the company itself? Amazon should investigate."
3,Listen to the samples before purchasing!,"I purchased this album off Itunes and did something I never do- I purchased without listening to any samples or reading any reviews. I figured how could I go wrong- my son loves all these movies, it'll will be some songs from all the sound tracks. I didn't expect the songs recorded by top 40 artists for the movies, but at least some of the extra songs that appear in all the movies. With the exception of Woody's Roundup (that we now listen to on REPEAT!!), none of the other songs are the versions that are in the movie & most don't even appear in the movies. A few have turned out to be quite cute, but not at all what I expected and not at all a sample of music from the Pixar movies."
2,Covers don't quite measure up,"We received this as a gift for our toddler. These are covers of the songs we'd come to love in some of our favorite Pixar films. It was a bit confusing and disappointing. In and of themselves, the songs are fine, but if you're looking for the originals, this isn't what you're looking for."
2,Expect the unexpected..,"I bought this a couple of years ago. When I played this in the car on the way home after buying it, my son and I were very disappointed. It has been played maybe 5 times since. I was definitely expecting at least some of the songs to be the originals from the movies. If you are looking for originals, this cd is not for you."
1,It should have been called the Morons guide to Oracle ...,"for those that don't know enough (or want to learn enough) to qualify as idiots.The book has many mistakes, too much fawning over Oracle, and not enough useful information. A better choice would be the Complete Guide to Oracle.I made the mistake of buying it at a Bricks and Mortar store after a quick look at it. I returned it a couple days later when I realized that however little I knew about Oracle that this book taught even less. This shows why reader comments at Amazon are so useful, had I read them I never would have wasted my time with the book."
4,A good start,"It's a good book if you don't have any idea what is a relational database. Sometimes it's boring to read, but it has a wide range of topics. The chapters are very well explained and it isn't about Oracle database only, it talks about SQL fundamentals, Oracle Forms, Oracle Reports, database tuning, Oracle Loader, PL/SQL, installation and so on. I like it to learn and as a reference."
2,not recommended for the techies among you,"Poorly organised, dumbed-down version of the ""Oracle: Complete Reference"" published by the Oracle Press in 1995. Full of typos and verbosity; mostly misses the point it's trying to make and the examples haven't always been checked either. Try ""Oracle Design"" or the other books by the O'Reilly Press if you are trying to use the product in a development environment."
1,A Complete Embarrassment - DON'T BUY.,"Clearly the authors/editors did not take the time to peruse the book for TYPOS, ERRORS IN THE SAMPLES, INCORRECT PASSAGES, etc. As a beginner I spent hours reading and re-reading the samples given in the book and asking my co-workers to clarify only to find out that I had been mis-lead by errors in the text. And the book is replete with errors! You would think the authors would be intelligent enough to stay away from using GLOBAL SEARCH & REPLACES when editing the book, let alone run a simple SPELL CHECK to catch a myriad of typos. The book also contains more advertising for Oracle Products than it has useful information. A definite disgrace for both ORACLE and the authors."
1,Don't buy this book....,"This book is definitely not for a beginner. I had to use this book for a beginning course for Oracle 8 and if it wasn't for a better book, I would have failed the course. On the other hand you may find it helpful if you are experienced in SQL and database lingo. I cannot comment from that viewpoint."
2,For general reader only,"I feel quiet disappointed reading this book. It's in general written for people who want to know what Oracle is all about and not as an introduction to Oracle 8 database.There are too many things to be covered in this small book. From NT to UNIX and all the way down to Personal Oracle making it difficult to concentrate as a begineer.The example doesn't provide a starting ground. I sometimes have the feeling that the authors has assumed the user has read some of the Oracle documentation already. Also, some of the topic are not in the latest version. For example, Oracle Form 4.5 (oracle 7) is more focus then the new Form 5.0 which comes with Oracle 8If you just want to know generally what Oracle is all about then this is for you."
1,Authors spend more time fawning over Oracle then teaching,"Very poorly organized, introduces complex topics before basics. Code examples almost always include the copyright notice presented when SQLPlus is activated which only serves to hide the actual example. Use of a different font for code examples would be a big help. Examples are disjointed, not consist with text, not done in a building block approach.They waste an entire chapter presenting the installation screens for different platforms without adding much of value beyond what the screen tells you anyway.Biggest problem with book is authors spend about 10% of their time praising Oracle for all the wonderful things they have done. This gets very tiresome and adds nothing to learning Oracle.As another reviewer indicated, it may be useful as a quick reference book, but falls short on being an introductory text."
2,Not a no-nonsense book,"This book contains an inordinately large number of errors which is irritating since a beginner does not know right from wrong. The code-examples are not well explained and one would like to think that an introductory book would pay special attention to this aspect. On the whole, it is a fair introductory book."
2,Overview material only,"This book is a good Oracle 8 overview, but contains MANY CODE MISPRINTS resulting in non-working examples and uncompilable code."
2,Don't get this book unless you have a lot of money to waste,I don't recommend this book to anyone. buy this book only if you have too muhc money and time on your hand. there are plenty of good books out there about Oracle and this is not one of them. This book does not explain things well and it is extremely dry and boring.
2,Ouch,"I really dont want to waste any more time on this video than I have to. I just thought it might be good save others of their money and time. They should be reported for their lack of content and terrible camera angles and shots.ps. I dont believe those good reviews, It must be family members."
1,Do Not Buy. A Rip Off.,"Some of the footage was decent, but most of the video was real boring. The camera angles and image quality were terrrible, as a result, I could barely see the action."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"Don't waste your money on this garbarge. At $..., this is a complete ripoff. This is the worst video I've watched since Showgirls. So, if you like Showgirls (minus the T&A), maybe this tape is for you. Otherwise, AVOID."
3,Entertainment differs from a quarrel.,"The honest talk and I purchased in quest of entertainment nature in this work.It becomes impossible however, to call it only ""the work with which the young man is only exchanging blows"", thanks to the edit which lacks in continuation and presence of the confused fighting scene which omitted remarkably the circumstances which result in it.A cheer, boos, blow sound, etc. could be put in more....I consider.Since entertainment was expected, it is regrettable a few."
5,Kim Mitchell-mini album,Awesome first release from the former Max Webster singer/guitarist. Kim Mitchell really delivers on this EP and it is a real treat for fans of Kim Mitchell or Max Webster as this is the first time it has been released on CD since it's original release in 1982
2,Did not last long,"It's good looking mouse pad, but it started to fall apart after a few weeks. The fabric with the graphics came off.It would be a cool pad if they invested a few more cents in better materials and construction."
2,Not so great,It did help the wrist and was amusing.The mouse pad is made of printed cloth and foam. After some time it absorbs sweat/oil from your wrist and will stink. The cloth print started to fade and smear and peal up after a short time. Perhaps they went to a cheaper manufacturer and so the problems I had did not appear for other reviewers. It was fun for a while but these issues made it not worth it.
3,a litte disappointing,"The gel mounds featured in this product are not as soft as the description suggests. They actually irritate my wrist and forearm a little when I rest them between as I move the mouse. I might try adding some felt to them. Otherwise, the product works much as it should."
5,Lots of information,I like this book so far. It is full of so much good information. A great book to help out a parent that has a child that was just diagnosed.
1,"1980 called, they want their book back","The information in this book was very dated. The help sheets they recommended were complicated for daily use. Children and parents of ADD/ADHD children need simplicity, there are plenty of additional tasks in a day of this disorder without adding 5000 complicated charts, task masters, and flowsheets to it. To me, it was a thick, repititious, useless book. On the same day, I ordered Parenting Children With Adhd: 10 Lessons That Medicine Cannot Teach (APA Lifetools)by Vincent J., Ph.D. Monastra and would give that one 5 stars!! He's an expert in his field and gives very straightforward information about the origins of ADHD, and the title speaks for itself. But please do yourself a favor and look at any title other than the ""kit."" I've yet to figure out what kit they were referring to."
2,ADD parent not satisfied!,"I purchased this *kit* based on the fact it had ideas, activities ... etc. Maybe me having ADD I missed some info on it? When I got it I was surprised to find it was a book! Not a *kit* at all. So I will probably never use it ... unless I was to purchase a copier machine and print off items as needed. I have read some of it and it had good ideas and info. Just not what I had purchased it for at all! =("
5,Finally....answers to my questions!!,"If you have an ADD child, order this book NOW!! How do you teach a child that cannot sit still to save her life? How do you teach a child to concentrate? How do you reach a child whose brain is so disorganized she can't remember what you've just said to her? This book actually gives you the answers. Dr. Flick actually tells us HOW TO REACH (and teach!) ADD children. The book contains surveys, checklists, charts, and worksheets to help us help ourselves. This book is the ""meat in the sandwich"". I highly recommend it!!"
4,A Must for Parents with ADHD kids,"This book is an excellent reference for any parent with children having ADHD. It covers so much information, and provides actual ideas and behavior modification plans to start on immediately. Going through the exercises is also very helpful in helping parents understand more clearly the difficulties they are experiencing with their children, and what behaviors they should try to eliminate, which need to be ignored, etc. The book was fairly objective in regards to providing the different treatment options available for ADHD. It should be read by parents of children both on and/or off medication, so that a good solid behavior modification plan get get into place."
1,Doesn't fit a 1990 Chevy G20 Mark III Conversion Van,"The wiring is not correct for a 1990 Chevy G20 Mark III Conversion Van. I even called Hopkins to make sure it would work, and they assured me it would. Oh well, another $20 out the window..."
1,RIP OFF!,RIP OFF! ALL GLOBAL TRESURES DVDS ARE LESS THAN 10 MINUTES LONG! RIP OFF! SHAME ON YOU AMAZON FOR NOT DISCLOSING THE RUNING TIMES OF THE DVDS YOU SELL US!
2,ninja4hire,"Not too helpful, meals seam pricey and when your runnin calls it can be hard to let something cook for hours and hours like some of the recipes."
2,Not very helpful,"This was mostly the authors list for himself and how to plan to list things you want to do in your life. The fifty items were mostly telling you what you need to think about and how to go about it, not 50 things to do with your life. It probably should be titled The things I am planning to do and how to achieve that goal."
1,Horrible book,"This is a horrible book, like all the others of its ilk. It epitomizes and encourages the worst kind of faulty thinking. All of its religious claims are absurb and wrong and quite frankly dangerous. Fanatic xians will probably like it, but then they wallow in absurdity every day of their lives. For people with active brain tissues, it is an insult."
5,A man of few words,"Evangelism and the Sovereignty of God (Ivp Classics)After two years of professing the reformed faith I finally got around to reading Packer's little book. I was reccomended to read it by my former Pastor just because he considered it a ''modern classic''. I think he was right. Packer is a man of few words, thus it was a quick read but every single word was important. Each page was full of deep spiritual insight that was based on scripture. This is a great book to those arminians whose only response to calvinism is ''John 3:16 says whosoever'' a billion times or to those open minded arminians who hold to the idea for some reason that calvinists never evangelized in history of the Church. This book, for those who wish to hold to those 2 mistaken views, will be disapointed. For those Calvinists who have a deep passion to see God's elect brought into saving faith and open-minded Remonstrants this book if for you."
3,Unique look at bland life of working class suburbia.,"I bought this purely because the guy who wrote it lived in my hometown. While the writing and overall plot of the book is subpar, I enjoyed the brief insights the author made about growing up in suburban Detroit. I could really relate to the whole idea of a Madison Heights Syndrome, growing up and the feeling you're going to be stuck in a dead-end town for your whole life. And at its heart its satire of the cult of personality and sensationalism of the media in this country is spot on. I wonder what ever happened to Andrew Wellman..."
2,This book provides a very concise review on the subject.,"This book does not get into much detail on every topic that it covers. Any book on ATM should have covered more on ""TCP/IP over ATM"". I didnot get much after I read this book. Therefore, I don't recommend this book."
2,It is,"The material in the book touches on Sonet, IP, ATM, and other topics.But it is not enough for a beginner and absolutely boring for any advanced reader.I would suggest instead to read the Bible of IP ""Internetworking TCP/IP vol. 1 (Comer)"" and ""ATM Resource Library, Volumes 1, 2 And 3 (Black, Prentice Hall)"".If those that want Sonet stuff try ""Sonet and T1 : Architectures for Digital Transport Networks (Black/Waters, Prentice Hall)"""
4,Very cute shoes,"Shoes arrived, but wrong size. Do NOT use the sizing info next to the size selection. It shows a US size 10 as a Euro 27 (which I ordered), but the seller uses a different sizing chart and sent a Euro 28 which, according to the sizing info on the website, is a US size 11."
3,Just okay...,"I love that my son enjoys Hot Wheels but as a parent, I prefer the original Hot Wheels movies. The characters of Battle Force 5 are whiny and predictable where as the original characters are funny and believable. I wish they would have kept the old characters and a similar storyline with the orange racetracks and real Hot Wheels cars!!As for the kiddos, they love it so I guess it comes down to whether or not you will watch with them, or clean the kitchen because personally this is one I can't watch."
5,Entertaining for all ages.,"My boys are 2 and 7 and they are both Hot Wheels fanatics! They love the cars, the tracks, the clothing, anything they can get their hands on. Everyone in our family loves the Acceleracers Hot Wheels movies, and the Battle Force 6 series is another winner. We don't have Cartoon Network, so we learned of the show when my son received the first episode with a toy car. He loved it and watched it over and over. I was so excited when I heard that more episodes were available on DVD and we all love these as well! Great characters, cool cars, exciting adventures!"
2,BoxWave Ruby Patent Leather elite (not color) nook case,"I returned the boxwave ruby patent leather elite nook case, it did not fit the color nook,I guess it was made for the original nook- which is smaller, even if it fit I would have returned it though, first it had an awful chemical smell, also looked cheap/ plastic like, the patent leather had dents/scratches in it from the packing material - so I wonder what it would look like after just normal use, I emailed right away and the response from boxwave was instant, I recieved a return number and return shipping because the product was damaged, very impressed with their customer service, now awaiting the refund on my credit card but do not anticipate problems. I would purchase from this company again because of their superb customer service!"
2,Too feminine,This nook 1st edition case was kind of interesting online but when i recieved the purchase i don't use it that much because it looks like a purse for a girl or something so i would not buy this type of design again because it looks like a purse
4,Fits perfectly and is aesthetically pleasing,Looks nice. Fits snugly. No complaints. It ships quickly and looks exactly like the pictures. The snap in the back is also magnetic which is easy to use and definitely a nifty bonus.
4,Almost perfect,"I absolutely love the ruby color of this cover, and it matches my purse like crazy. My only improvement would be to incorporate a bit of padding so that when the cover is closed, there is no worry at all about your device. While the cover is completely encased, there is no padding at all - just felt."
3,I like it despite it's many drawbacks,"The case is a little small for the nook, almost like it was designed for the kindle and relabeled for the nook. The padding between the patent leather and the lining leaves the glossy surface susceptible to scratches and dings from keys and other pocketbook items. Last, but not least, the clasp fastens in the back rather than the front. It shows this in the picture, but it's not something you think about until you have it in front of you and realize that it's backward.On the positive side, it's half the cost of the least expensive covers at Barnes and Noble. It's also great to have piece of mind that your keys are not going to break your screen, and it is a pretty color."
3,This case has a glossy finish!,"This case has a glossy finish, not a matte finish like I was expecting. I must have missed noticing that the images had a slight shine.The 'pocket' doesn't hold much, just a few pieces of paper. Anything more makes it difficult to secure the latch.Folding the front panel back leaves a crease mark on the otherwise glossy finish. It is also very easy to accidentally press the power button.I like that the cover is stiff enough and slightly padded to protect my screen, and that it latches closed.The case fits snugly, there is no extra room to fit a silicone case, as Amazon suggests."
5,Great buy,I recently purchased this item and LOVEEE it. It is well worth the money. It holds my nook it place perfectly!! The color is great and stylish. After I placed the order I got it 3 days later. Great buy:)
5,Perhaps the best book I ever read,"From the first page, Phillip Yancey does a remarkable job of sharing his candid insights into the concept of God's unmerited favor. In a style that is characterized by frank and unabashed honesty, the author examines much of the baggage and myth of faith as regards one of God's most precious gifts.I have given this book to more than twenty people, and have heard the testimonies of about that many more. All concur that Phillip Yancey has done once again a remarkable job of scratching where people are itching.Readers might like to also consider another Yancey triumph, The Jesus I Never Knew."
5,A must for all pastors,"I did not know what to expect of Yancey, I had not red any of his book prior to this one. I got hoocked after the first page.I believe that every christian and defenetly every pastors should read this book.We serve a God of love and as Jesus says: I will know my followers by their fruith, and the fruith is that you love one another.As Christians we say a lot of right morally speeking, but we need to be sure we say and preach that truth in love. So many times we come across as condaming. Paul talks about that in 1. Kor 13. We can speek with human or angles language, we can know all the secretes of the world, we can have profetic gifts, we can even give our own bodies as a giving, but if we have not love....Take your time and read this book. Use it as a thremometer to find out how warm your love is.Frode Schanke Eikum"
5,Grace so amazing,"I have read most of Yanceys books and I never fail to be challenged and affirmed. His views always seem to ring with my deep inner thoughts, things I could never put into words. I feel this writer has a real clear idea of what true Christianity is all about."
5,It is Amazing!,"A fascinating and intelligent presentation on Grace, well presenting the need for it, esp today. The author has also created some study guides that make it very easy to gain grace at a practical level.One good book in point that does make this same case is the oddly titled True Astral Worship, which grace in a very different way.Both great books leading to the same end!True Astral Worship: Why Today, More Than Ever, Are The Pre-Religions Very Important."
5,Surprised and Pleased,"This book was not what I was expecting (the humdrum grace is free deal). It really attacks the Christian attitude about our reluctance to give GRACE to others. This is an outstanding insight into the current attitude of many churches and Christians today. A must read for those active in ministry. Could not put it down...not a thriller, but a mind thinker..."
2,"Phenomenal concept, horrible execution","""What's So Amazing About Grace"" is a life-changing book, and this edition is brilliant in its concept of visually enhancing the book's written message. However, notice the book's dimensions: 6 inches by 5.5 inches. This is FAR too small for the pictures to have the necessary impact, and much of the text is far too small to comfortably read. This design yearns for a large format (maybe the hardback was bigger?); a 6-inch square cannot do it justice. I caution people in buying this book simply because I found it too small to enjoy/appreciate/study, etc."
5,Life Changing,"I was given this book initially and it has completely changed the way I view God, grace, and forgiveness. Since then I bought the original book that inspired this visual edition, and it was great too. I bought more of these to give them out as Christmas gifts to family. I wanted to share what I had learned from it with everyone. I definitely recommend this book!"
4,Different standards of Grace,"I love Phillip Yancey. The problem I have with this book is that he complains that the church today is focused on abortion and gays, which Jesus never talked about. But he praises the church that helped to end slavery and bring civil rights, and I'm not sure Jesus talked much about those issues either. Because the logic in inconsistent, it can take away from his powerful message: grace is what we can offer that no one else can"
3,good book,"I have read several of Yancey's books, and have always liked his writing style, and the way he approaches many different issues within Christianity. He ask honest questions and really try to develop the answers. However often time, at the end he leave it open ended or leave answers that are still open to further questions.I think in this particular book, Yancey often confuses grace with charity, compassion and forgiveness. He claims that Christianity is the only religion that offers grace. It maybe true when it come to personal relationship with God, but not necessarily true when it comes to inter human relationships. Other religions also teaches charity, compassion and forgiveness in relationships."
3,"Some food for thought, with a lot of bitterness in between","As is true of any believer, I need to incorporate more of God's grace in my relationships. That seems to be the focus of this book. However, as I got toward the end I realized that Yancey's one achilles heel is that he can't seem to write about much more than how bad his upbringing in a fundamentalist southern church was, and seems to never tire of bashing the church in a weak and somewhat 'ungracious' way. A couple of times he admits that this tendency reveals a lack of grace in his own heart, and such honesty is helpful. But then you turn the page and he's back at it again. One wonders if Yancey will ever grow up and learn from the mistakes he admittedly keeps making.Basically, if you've already read The Jesus I Never Knew, then don't bother with this one. It's the same basic rant recycled."
3,Not What I Expected...,"I had been looking for a book that really explained (as much as one could) grace. This book is more of a history book on Grace. Talking about Germany, the Nazis and different other countries and the past and how grace made things better. No offense, I think it's a great book if you're looking for that kind of thing but I was looking for something to read that I can apply right now. Not something analyzing the past as much as this book did. It was... ok. I don't see how others felt it was a ""must read"" of a lifetime. Either way, it was uplifting. Just not the way I expected it to be."
1,Stunning Lack of Scholarship,"Yancy is just a blowhard bigot with no credentials as a scholar or an intellectual. C.S. Lewis or Francis Schaeffer, popular scholars but by no means intellectuals, tower over Yancy. He would be the very LAST person to understand Grace!"
1,Questionable Attitude Towards Grace,"This book exemplifies the questionable attitude that what ever you do, you can be forgiven if you ask for grace. This means that if Adolf Hitler, in the last nanosecond of his life sought grace he would go to heaven despite all of his horrible crimes against humanity whereas a Jewish person who had no need for Jesus would automatically go to hell despite his myriad good deeds. This attitude seems to be a case of all-or-nothing thinking, an elementary cognitive distortion that seems to be rampant with fundamentalist Christ-ians like Yancey.Jesus never claimed divinity it was only when Saint Paul and some other followers decided to promote him as such. It was a sophomoric effort to dumb down the religion (Judaism) to attract the most followers. By resorting to hocus-pocus, Christianity became Christ-inanity."
5,A True Gift!,This book is a true gift of joy and confirmation to believers in the grace of Christ. Philip Yancey has an elegance about his writting that fits the topic of grace perfectly. I came away changed and grateful.
3,Grace-ful,"Learn, feel, probe and appreciate the one word that describes our lives as Christians--- GRACE. This book does not even attempt to define it but you will get the point. There is a drawback, though... you will realize areas in your life- thoughts, words, actions- that is in the state of un-GRACE, and you may need to change."
1,Yancey Does NOT Understand God's Grace,"Yancey doesn't understand God's grace. He just spouts popular mumbo jumbo coming out of Christianity Today, which has no respect for the Word of God or the Kingdom of Christ. Yancey needs to understand that to understand grace, he needs to undersand the nature of sin and the predicament of eternal damnation in Hell. If he doesn't understand this -- and he doesn't seem to -- then he cannot understand grace. This book is just a popular collection of ideas not founded on the Word of God."
1,Pastor,"I was not pleased because it was said this book was new. The previous owner has written a testamony on the inside jacket. The book is in good shape but it is not new and should not be sold as new. When selling books I would appreciate a closer watch on new and ""like new"" there is a difference, I am willing to pay a little extra to get new but I expect it to be new not carefully read."
5,A wake up call for Christians,"What's So Amazing About Grace is a must read book for all Christians. It is one of the great books on contemporary Christianity and for me is probably the most meaningful such book since C S Lewis' Mere Christianity. Most importantly it forces us Christians to look at ourselves and the image we project to the rest of the world. Yancy does a great job of explaining why Grace is so important in this world and explains how Grace is what sets Christians apart from all other religions. He argues that too often Christians have not been ""grace-full"" and the result has been that we have turned off too many of those we are trying to attract."
5,"Second in all of my reading, first being the Bible.","I have a small library of books that I have read in College and have read many since then. ""What's so amazing about grace"" has literally been life changing for me. I have for 30 years tried to earn ""brownie points"" with God. It was through Yancey's book that I found the freedom to breathe in God's true grace and still strive to live holy but this time only through what he does in me, not what I can do for him. I know this book will be a life changer for you as well. Jesus truly reached out his hands on the cross offering you and I grace that will draw us closer to him. Enjoy!"
4,honest and compassionate,"If you are accused by some of being too liberal, others call you too conservative then I'm guessing you are just right! Kudos to Yancey for his fair, honest, tender book. He doesn't shy away from the tough questions."
4,Gracefull,"The book began very good. I enjoyed the thought that Yancey presented on forgiveness, which I believe is highly relevent to the time we are living in now, and what is going on in America. What I did not like however was how after the fifth chapter or so, the book really seemed repetative. He was saying the same things, just with new examples. Overall a good book though."
5,Beautifully Written Book,"This was my first Philip Yancy book. My dad has always been a avid reader of his books and now I know why. It has given me a whole new perspective of what Christianity is in its simplest form. A meaningful book for Christians old and new, along with anyone who is curious about the purest example of love: grace. I don't consider myself a super emotional person but there were several parts that brought tears to my eyes. It's so easy to disregard the power of grace. But to do so is to miss something essential to the Christian faith. Grace isn't always easy but this world would be a better place if more people gave it a chance."
5,Well Written and Relevant,This book deals with the issue of grace and forgiveness as it applies in today's world with insightful examples in the context of the 20th ccentury. It is well worth perusing bby those interested in religious topics.
2,Just a So-So Effort,"Please, don't shoot the messenger. I am a Christian and not some anti-Christian trying to write a bad review. As for this book, I was immediately taken in when I read one critic on the back cover of the book state that it was the best book that he had ever read. Well, since I had read Yancey's ""The Jesus I Never Knew"" (Which I consider to be the greatest book ever written), then I was excited to read this book. Needless to say, I was disappointed. The book had its interesting moments, but never came close to living up to the hype. Just an average book. I love the concept of Grace and all, but this book didn't really do much for me. Yancey kind of lost his direction half way through. I finished the book only because I wanted to complete what I had finished. I'm not trying to offend anybody, rather, I want people to have a candid review."
2,'Grace' and 'truth' came through Jesus Christ,"The author raises some very good questions, however, he is only restating what others have said. In a nutshell he believes the problems in the church of Christ exists because there is a lack of 'grace' being practised. If there is a problem in the church we look for some place to put the blame so we can explain the discrepencies between Christian teaching and Christian behaviour. This, however, puts people on guilt trips as they try, once again, to catch that elusive life of grace. Could it be there is a lack of grace because there is a lack of Christ? Scripture says 'grace' and 'truth' came through Jesus Christ. The two go together, you cannot have grace unless you have truth and visa versa. If there is a lack of 'grace' in the church of Christ, it must be that there is a lack of 'truth'. People's behaviour is based on what they believe is right. Therefore, wrong teaching must be the culprit and not wrong people."
5,Everyone needs to read this book - Christian or not,"This is one of my favorite books of all time. I've bought many copies and given them away. To me this book summarizes what Jesus was all about - love, forgiveness...GRACE."
5,Great book for Christains and Non-Christains Alike,This book was given to me by a very close friend.This is the best book I have read (bible excepted). It is easy to read and provides an uplifting look at how life is.Forgiveness is the key concept here and acceptance of this is shown as crucial.The illustrations backing up points mentioned is extremely well done.
3,For Better and Canada,"If you can call this music? The ladies cannot sing to save summer. I like this because it is offensive, about sex, funny, and vocally terrible. It will wake up the neighbors for sure. In listening to this I picture drunk,angry women trying to make music. The best song Talks about a Shoeshine boy selling his soul to the street.Very comical indeed. The song grabbing the Spotlight is Teenage Meat.I can see why the song titles are not listed here; With good reason."
4,good alternative therapies,"The illnesses and treatments that are covered are very good, practical and down to earth. It really helps to have access to a good supply of herbs and tinctures to use this book. My daughter likes all of the herbs I have used with her, so there is no problem getting her to take her 'medicine.' I have found a few common kid illnesses lacking and hope the author comes out with a more comprehensive book on treating children at some point"
5,excellent,"currently, I am doing lessons from this this book.It is an excellent book to get in touch with the goddess.It has a lot of powerful information.A++"
5,the Great Spirit resides here,I am a Strega. During my first pathworking experience the Holy Strega initiated me into the Old Ways. Be a Goddess! Is exciting. The Great Spirit can be felt in her words and is evident from the prayer she gives at the very beginning of her book. This is a holy woman and priestess of the Old Ways.
1,No one-star reviews? Allow me to be the first!,"I cannot believe that so many people actually loved this book... I hated it. The author has a nasty case of guru-ism; she trademarked her path fer cryin' out loud. Fluffy-bunny, feel-good nonsense, much that is plain garbage and a sensible person could easily figure out the rest on their own. But then again, a sensible person wouldn't be taken in by this trash.I wanted to return this book, but I was so disgusted with the contents that returning it wasn't violent enough. I destroyed it instead."
2,"So, so book!","There is very little that this book can offer in the way of truly changing your life. Anything that you wish to change or create must come from within you, not from a so-called ""spell"" or ""magic"". The book must be read as common sense rather than anything mystical, of which we all have within us but need to bring to the surface.Also, why are 99% of the reviews for this book by women? Nothing to do with this review, but very odd after glancing at them. Huh!"
5,A real look behind the scene and succes of a World Champion,"The story begins with a realistic look of sidecar racing history and its great drivers and passengers. Things you have to know about the subject. The late George O'Dell describes his way to the top, the ups & downs. All that in a environment of the authentic Continental Circus as it was (70-ties) and never will be again. The upcoming of two-stroke and down going of the famous Rennsport BMW. As well as the intoduction of monocoque frames. An change of era viewed from within a team. For the enthousiast, a book to read in one breath. I lent my book to a ex-sidecar driver and I never saw it back. I think I know why... With great, spectacular and unseen pictures."
3,IT GETS BETTER WITH AGE!,"The ""hero"" of this series is probably one of the most obnoxious people you'll ever watch on tv. He's a little Napoleaon, mean, mean spirited and not a little misogynistic. However...as the series progresses we see LaPlante - the creator/writer - finally making him a LITTLE more tolerable. Also, around volume six the actress playing the female lead changes and frankly, it's for the better.There is one weird thing I've discovered about Amazon...when I watch this on my computer I have all of the volumes (about 20, I think, with two episodes in each volume) but when I stream it on my tv, a number of the episodes just disappear. Can't access them...weird and annoying.Anyhow, if you like police detective shows from the UK with a bit of a twist, this one is pretty good as it ages. The early shows only rate a 3 star but the later ones I'd give a 4/5 star rating."
4,Great Product and new,"Just be careful as to whom you purchase from. DO NOT TRUST a vendor by the name of ""jerry1977"". Buy from ""jerry1977"" and you will not be happy!!!Another vendor Mobilshark is excellent, but his printers are 220v not 110 volt so be sure to ask for the converter. Mobil shark is very easy to deal with. I only rated this as a four as the ad is misleading on the voltage."
5,Every Bill Leeb fan should have this album in thier collection.,"If you can get your hands on this album then take it, you won't be dissapointed. Other than Delerium this album is one of Bill's better side projects."
2,"Meh, techno","Bill Leeb has always had a thing for plain ol' techno, which I find boring.I was hoping for something similar to Intermix's Phaze Two, a creative and novel mixture of urban, techno, and industrial beats. This album was just light techno, no industrial edge to it, not even enough hard beats to dance to. Just plain boring."
4,"Of Course, Sara!!","Hey, Sara!!! Of Course you can be my best friend here at Amazon!!! You are my only friend here. Thank you for all the nice things you said about me. You are a true friend.EsweetieBratz 4 LifeP.s.- You should check out mgae.com. It is so cool!!!"
4,Dear Esweetie...,"You are soooooooo sweet,and a nice girl.Can I be your best friend here at amazon.com???Because I need to end a friendship with someone here.I don`t have a real friendship in my life.S@R@ SIBLINI!!!write back..."

1,Don't bother!,"I was very surprised to find that this mascara was clumpy, gooey and sticky upon arrival. It gummed up my lashes but GOOD.Perhaps it was this particular type or perhaps the dealer had kept it too long and it was too old, I don't know.Caveat emptor, is all I can say. I went with Almay instead. Works great."
5,"Beautiful, elegant, stylish.",I really love these totes that adorn the upper shelves in my closet. I've debated taking them down and using them elsewhere in my house because they're so beautiful... but that would leave me with my original dilemma of dressing up my closet.
4,I like em,"I played with them all season, they were great. Taking them to the National Flag Football tournament in Florida. Cutters are stickier, these feel better on your hand and look better. trade off is preference really. Cutters also have the upper hand on durability but these are def not cheap like suggested in the other review."
1,they sent me wrong item!,"I never received it! They sent me some totally lame cd by Dave Mathews Band. It wasn't worth my time to send it back. I think they probably did not have the Chuck Mangione CD and just grabbed anything to send. Very dissappointed. If this gets back to them, tell them I want my Chuck Mangione CD please!Many thanks,Fred"
4,Disco Dancing - Need to have this one,This CD has many of the classics that are not on the other compilations of disco music. It was so great to hear the music again. Definately a good buy
4,pure disco - pure fun,great songs by the original artists; what else can you hope for when you want to kick back and enjoy the flash and rhythm of a good disco tune?
3,Review of Pure Disco Vol. I,The music is what I expected. However the CD Case had a utility knife slice across the front of the jewel case
2,Extremely dissapointed,"If you like the original version of ""I will survive"" do not buy this CD. This version is horrible!!! Unfortunately, I opened the CD and couldn't return it."
2,Cd... good conditon.....songs bad.. lol,The cd was in great condition. I just didnt really care for the songs on it.....lol.. I should have listened to it before buying it.
2,My kids Love This Collection!,"I do too...Listening, i forget how long it has been since thesesongs were popular! Few of these artsts had great albums,but if you are looking for a collection of good disco music from a funera...when you could still escape with music...this is a must-have! My kids love it too...and they are very young!Regina"
3,Some good disco music,About half the titles are good . The others are really poor selections of songs by one hit wonders and songs that bombed on the charts.
4,Study!,"The numbers don't lie. Most applicants fail the NY Court Officer Exam. This book prepared me very well. When I sat down to take the exam, I had the confidence of someone who had taken the test a few times, because I had completed the comprehensive practice exams contained in this book. I was eventually hired in the first round of hirings of my list. I have this book and my wife(who made sure I studied) to thank.If you are taking the NYSCO Trainee Exam this fall, don't screw around. Spend the twenty bucks, buy this and the Barron's study guide and study.The $20 dollars is nothing to pay for a great career. Good Luck!"
2,Save your money!,"I've got a lot of time for these dodgy but charming old 60's Marvel cartoons, but the cheapness of their production shouldn't be reflected by the company producing these tapes!About 15 mins of cartoons recorded onto an EP tape? Come on...!Wait for someone to have the good sense to release the lot on DVD - with the amount of Marvel movies doing the rounds at the moment it can't be that far away."
2,CFO Metaphor Goes Too Far,"The target audience for this book is probably the business person who is not currently in the best habits of discussing money at home. The CFO metaphor goes a little far for my taste. While cute, and a great place to start conversation, the authors stretch the metaphor too far. They use a lot of language about business finance that may not be familiar, or comfortable, for the average household. While its advice is sound, and the book's ""heart"" is in the right place, I found the language and metaphor a little difficult to digest. David Bach's ""Smart Couples Finish Rich: 9 Steps to Creating a Rich Future for You and Your Partner"" has a very similar approach, but I found used layman's terms to better effect to make a discussion of finance less scary for a household."
3,"Good value, but hard to fit on old faucets","This is a good eyewash for the money. If your faucet is less than 25 years old, it will probably work fine. However, the adapters that came with it did not fit on the old faucet at the laboratory. I purchased another adapter from Ace Hardware that fits onto the faucet, and onto one of the adapters that came with the eyewash. The problem now is that with two adapters, the eyewash is rotated so that it points toward the wall!"
