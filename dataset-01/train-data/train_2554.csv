1,NO STARS,"This movie is absolute RUBBISH. Crap script, ham acting, poor effects, no pace, terrible editing.....wait till it arrives on DVD in the $2:00 bargain bin (wont take long) then watch it if theres NOTHING else to do. In fact dont bother, it still wouldnt be worth it.Those who compare or say it is inspired by the GREATS (TCM Evil dead etc.) are sorely mislead. Instead of an homage this movie completley misses the mark in all areas.Im annoyed at myself for wasting a free pass to see this flick."
1,ELI ROTH IS THE WORST HORROR DIRECTOR TODAY,"IT'S NOT GORYIT'S NOT CRUDEIT'S NOT FUNNYTHERE'S NO STORYTHERE'S NO SCARESTHERE'S NO BUILD-UPEli Roth is a little 12 year old boy who's trying to be clever and witty and Mr. Horror man, but instead he's stupid and pathetic and tries too hard to do something WHEN THERE'S NOTHING HERE AT ALL.so now Mr. Eli has some money and he can make his little movies...this movie is nothing, the dialogue is nothing...go see last house on the left, the original Texas Chainsaw, the original hills have eyes...that's horrorthis movie is made by a little boy who has a goal of one day of being ""really scary"" but the only road block is that he ""HAS NO TALENT AND DOESN'T UNDERSTAND HORROR MOVIES AT ALL."""
1,just dont watch the end,"its actually better if you just turn it off about fifteen minutes before its over. the camp, humor, everything is wasted by the dumbest ending possible to the movie. absolutely worthless. no explination given for anything, let alone who pulled the ending out of the toilet like that, not even worth watching the movie if you insist on seeing how it ends."
1,One star is one too many.,"This movie is drivel. Stupid plot & lack of originality make for a deadly combination.DO NOT WATCH THIS PIECE OF JUNK. NOT EVEN IF SOMEONE BOUGHT OR RENTED IT, IN THE END YOU'D JUST BE WISHING YOU COULD HAVE THE LAST 2 HOURS OF YOUR LIFE BACK."
1,They've got to be kidding,I had no idea as to whether or not this was a comedic movie. I actually ended up laughing through this movie. The ending couldn't be funnier. I don't understand people giving serious reviews.
3,A group of teens rent a cabin in the woods,"Haven't we seen this before? A group of teens gets a cabin out in the middle of the woods.During their first night they counter a crazy man would has some kind of virus.The teens kill the man, and once they come in contact with his blood,their skin starts to rot away.Some progress sooner than others as they all try to find a cure to keep from becoming eaten away at by the virus.Nothing special,but if you like this sort of thing you might as well watch it."
3,Rider Strong is awesome!,"i loved the fact Rider Strong was in it...but im dissapointed that the movie wasnt as good as i had hoped. there was plenty of blood! the concept of the movie was great but the writers didnt play it out well. i didnt find it scary, but i definitly looked away a few times, if u get what im sayin'! i really had high hopes for it...."
3,Very weird..but good!,"Short and sweet...this movie over 5 different films that if you look carefully, you'll see what inspired the director to make it1-Evil dead (the cabin, the woods)2-28 Days later (the blood..and i won't spoil the film with the other examples)3-Night of the living dead (still can't spoil the film)4-Texas chainsaw massacre (but without the killer or chainsaw)5-One crazy summer (the comic relief, an 80's teen flick)Mix them all together..there you have it ""CABIN FEVER""!!But is it good? Rent it first and decide..but the DVD features are good enough to actually buy the film (I love pancakes!!)"
1,Don't buy this movie!,It said it was going to be scarey but actually it was quite funny. funny how lame it was. these kids get a deice and kill each other. There is so much blood all over the place. If you think this is a scarey movie your wrong it's a comedy.
2,Uninspired,"By riding the wave of Japanese and Spanish horror flicks over the last three years, I guess I've irreparably damaged myself. I'm permanently soured on American-made horror movies. Cabin Fever is no exception. Though its indie status and nice camerawork are alluring, it trots out the old Hollywood cliches like a champ (kids rent cabin in woods, are divided by an invading ""evil""--been there, done that). Its humor seems out of place, too. I apologize, BUT ARE THERE ANY U.S. DIRECTORS OUT THERE PAYING ATTENTION TO PEOPLE LIKE KIYOSHI KUROSAWA OR JUAME BALAGUERO? Bring on the Pang Brothers, please. By the way, anyone thinking the New Wave of Asian horror is kaputt, check out ""The Uninvited"" 2003 with Park Shin Yang and Jeon Ji Hyun. Nice little psychological creeper, with a breathtaking, slo-mo high-rise suicide scene. Absolutely brain-chilling. I guess maybe someday there will be another American horror movie that does the job--but Cabin Fever isn't one of them by any stretch."
4,Best Horror Movie Since The Ring,"I really loved this movie, it started out kind of slow making you think it was just another teen 'slasher' movie, But then it picks up and it is really what real people would do. IT was just so realistic if you laughed at it you're an idiot. You save your laughing for 'The Rotten Fruit' Extras. This movie had gore sure, but it was all in the right place, and it was pretty freaky. I would recommend this to anyone, especially someone going camping soon."
2,Pass the cheese please :),"This movie definitely belongs in the comedy section of horror movies. It is definitely entertaining if you watch it with some of your best buds. It does not belong with the greats but it is just a fun film that may reach a cult status just like ""The Stuff."" All I really have to say is ""PANCAKES!!!""...now I know all of you will go out and watch it just to find out what that exactly means...doncha? LOL, it is really worth renting it just for the laughs. :0)"
3,director's cut????,"Well,Iguess it is a director's cut.It is an extended version of cabin fever.Yeah,but do I really need it? No.If you already got the original release,keep it and save the money.The movie contains not more gore or splatter,but some extended talk and scenes."
1,No Evil Dead here just Evil Dumb,"I agree with the other guy. Eli Roth is an idiot. Has he ever even seen a classic horror film? Unbelievable he wrote and directed Hostel coz that flick was awesome. And he was beside himself when people asked if that was the Evil Dead cabin. Uh, hello??? OBVIOUSLY not you morons.Pure waste of time and I am sick of horror flicks that can't decide if they are a comedy or scary. Nothin made sense in this movie and the ending was STOOPIT. And NO one would let a little mental biter kid interact with customers on a porch not even in the 'awshucks-down-home-Mayberry' where we're all stupid....But the hot chick naked in the tub was---uh--HOT."
3,Pretty Good,"This movie is not as bad as people say. Compared to most of the crappy horror movies that are currently being made, this was pretty good. It had horror, gore and comedy, and i found myself not wanting to turn it off after a few minutes, which is a good sign. Rent it, and see if you agree."
2,get it right,I have recieved 2 defective cd's from this company and am now waiting for the third try to arrive here. I am not hopefull
1,not worth the money,This movie was sooo boring...all you do is wait for something to happen which isn't until the past 1.2 hour. very dissapointing.
1,THE WORST MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN THIS YEAR,"This is the absolute worst horror film made in years. What a total waste of time. Who was the moron who gave this movie the green light. Please god - don't let this director make anything else.I really, really, really hated this piece of trash. I wish there was an option to give NO STARS because that's what this film deserved.A total Raimi rip-off (except that Raimi had cool demons possess the characters and had an amazing visual flair even at the age of 19 when he made the original Evil Dead.)I just totally loathed this vomitous crap. Every single character was moronic and unlikable. Were we supposed to hate them all so much that we'd be glad when they started to bleed? The ending was a total lame-ass rip off of ""Night of the Living Dead"".I'll never watch one of this guy's movies ever again. I want the 90 mins of my life back!"
1,Crap - Evil Dead it aint,Way too much praise has been heaped on this turkey. It's a shoddy little Evil Dead rip off. I have a massive collection of DVDs (approx 2000+) with a huge majority of those being horror movies. I do not own this movie as it is not worthy of being included in the collection.Eli Roth is a poser and is plugging himself as the future of horror - let's hope his future projects live up to the hype he has created for himself otherwise he's going to look like an idiot. More so than he does now.Lame movie - don't waste your time. Go watch Evil Dead 2 instead.
3,"""Cabin Fever"" is for those who like blood","Ive not seen so much blood spewed out in a long time.Buckets o' blood and not a bad movie either.A cabin full of young people are attacked by a strange skin eating disease and the local hicks all at the same time.My main complaint with this film is that is suffers from what so many other horror films suffer from---that slick Hollywood look.The locals arent nearly grimy and greasy-headed looking enough and the chicks in the film always seem to keep that makeup and clean hair look even after days of torment.This film could have been great if it had had a nastier ,dirtier ,grimier look about it.But back to the blood---massive amounts are spewed and shot and poked out of the kids and the local rednecks and even some animals.Great gory fun and there is even a sympathetic killing with a shovel of a poor chick whose face has been eaten off.Yeeee---haaaaa.Now this isnt good enough to buy the DVD but for a 2 buck rental it is a satisfying watch."
1,This Movie SUCKED!!!,"See above, this movie just plain sucked, I love b-movies and horror movies, I even liked Killer Tongue... but this... this should never have been made, it is a good example of what happend when the same person writes, directs, and produces a movie... there is no one to tell him it SUCKS!!!! most of the movie made no sense, there were tons of loose ends, nothing is ever exlained, people get sick, people die that is the movie.BTW WTF was in the box? anyone know?the only good part of the movie was the end, it was funny."
2,Bad Sequel,I was expecting this movie to take place in a cabin just like the first one but instead ut takes place at a prom?WTH?This one definitly didn't have the same feel to it as the first Cabin Fever wich I liked.This is one seems like it was aimed more to the younger crowd.You really don't feel anything for the characters in this one and it wasn't as scary.It seems like the virus spread to fast here.In the first Cabin Fever you saw the girl slowly wasting away.I heard they had a different director or producer on this one.He sure didn't know what he was doing.
1,landfield waste,This has to be one of the worse sequels I think I have ever seen. Who ever wrote the screenplay must have a flesh eating bug inside them. It is horrible. No one with ANY maturity could like it. The acting is undiscribably toxic. The graphic scenes are almost as bad. The more I watched. The more I realized. Somebody owes me 86 min's of my life back. I can't believe the people in charge of this junk were proud of it. PLEASE!!!!! don't waste your time with this junk unless you want to get back at your worse enemy and give to them as a birthday present but don't let them know it was you who gave it to them.
1,hysterical but far from frightening,"I think i can safely say this is one of the top three most terrible movies i have ever seen. With an aim at being ""the most terrifying movie of the year"" cabin fever deffinately lets down. However, i must say not because of the intended reasons, i enjoyed the movie. It was one of the funniest movies i had seen in a very long time. And it was funny in the way of, where the hell did that come from? For example, for those of you have heard about the infamous pancake scene? And not to mention the ghetto-santa clause looking-hick at the gas station trying to sell the unsuspecting teens fox piss? absoloutly hysterical. Maybe i would buy this movie, just for the sake of its humor. But if your looking for a good scare, look els where. But who am I to judge, I hate critics, dont you? rent it and laugh out loud for yourself."
3,CABIN FEVER,THIS ONE WASNT ALL THAT GREAT. IT WASNT REALLY SCARY IT WAS JUST GROSS. IFG YOU LIKEBLOODY MOVIES WHERE THERE IS NO PLOT THEN YOU WILL LIKETHIS MOVIE......OTHERS WILL NOT. WHEN A GROUP OF FRIENDS STAY IN A CABIN IN THE WOODS ONE OFTHEM BEGINS TO GET SCK. CAN THIS SICKNESS KILLSOMEONE.? CAN IT SPREAD. WELL WATCH THIS FLAT MOVIE AND FIND OUT.
3,Fever blisters.,"I caught this one on a reluctant pay-per-view that paid off. Thinking it was a straight-up horror film I was in awe at how bad it was. About halfway through it hit me that this was a clever little spoof (albiet a subtle one), on woodsy horror flicks. In fact the more I think about it afterward the funnier it was. The use of cliche's are absolutely intentional, therefore making CABIN FEVER a twistedly creative(if not somewhat original) shocking comedy that isn't great, but good in it's own right. Think EVIL DEAD and DOG SOLDIERS with a flesh eating virus. Decently amusing B-movie entertainment."
1,The art of false advertising!,"From the moment Eli Roth (the director) makes his cameo, this film takes an immediate nosedive and the viewer is almost forced to watch this visual train wreck. I just finished viewing the DVD and I swear I have no idea of what I just saw. My brain is still on fire and spinning out of control over this movie. What the hell was that? I got this move as a ""free rental"" and I immediately called the manager at Blockbuster and demanded my money back! This is one the worst movies I have seen in years. Every one should watch this move so that we have a clear reference point for what a bad move looks and feels like"
1,Turkey!,"(...).I love horror movies, even stupid ones, but this one is so amazingly horrible that I can't believe it was ever released at all!There was no plot. No suspense or terror. No heroes, no survivors or people solving the problem. In fact, I can't even remember how the virus started in the first place, other than some guy who is sick comes up to them and infects them. The characters are so dull that you don't even care when they start dying.It was just boring. Whoo hoo, Sean from ""Boy Meets World"" and a bunch of kids go to a cabin, get sick, and die, and not even in interesting ways. Oh, and one girl gets eaten by a dog, but you don't even get to see it. It's only implied.The only amusing part is at the very end, with the old man at the general store and his niggas."
1,it was SO nice of LIONSGATE...,"...to allow amateurs to make this movie...i mean, a movie crew with REAL talent COULD HAVE done it, but instead it was so cool that they put it in the hands of some really bad filmmakers. at least they gave them a chance. truth is, this movie sucks big time. its awful...its an example of what NOT to do. it won't sell DVD's...fans of the original will be pissed off...you'll be angry that you invested 90 minutes on it if you watch it. personally i stopped after 39 minutes. dumb, cheap, boring, you'll see unfortunately...you're probably too dumb to not check it out. im sorry for you."
2,Simmer Down,"I'd heard a lot of good word of mouth about this movie and was curious to see it. It looked like a monster movie. But without a monster.The ""monster"" this time out to the woods is a flesh-eating bacteria and the movie is creative about how this gory bug brings out the worst in its stock characters. The script has fun with horror film conventions and the typical characters found in them. Fans of SCREAM should like it.But about two-thirds of the way through, the movie feels like it runs out of steam. It becomes another waiting game to see when whomever's left will get infected and how the armed hillbillies will chase them.A monster would have been nice.Or at least fun in the hands of these writers."
2,I love bad horror films but this one is just lame.,I thought this movie was pretty lame. It wasn't all that interesting. I didn't like any of the characters and was rooting for them all to die.The only part of this movie worth seeing is the first 5 minutes and the last 5 minutes. Basically the old couple that runs the country store. Those 10 minutes were all that separated this film from a million other cheesy horror films. I love bad horror films but this one is just lame.
2,Cabin Fever 2 - Spring Fever Horrible,"When I saw that there was a Cabin Fever 2, I immediately thought of Eli Roth and was very disappointed to find he had nothing to do with this one. The sad part is, it was when I realized how crappy it was that I said, ""this can not be an Eli Roth flick"". I love horror just like the next guy but this was just a horrible film. Sure, it had lots of good gore, I agree but the storyline sucked and it didn't compare at all to the first one. I am fond of gross stuff so admittedly, I watched the chick spitting up into the sink after the BJ scene a couple times and proudly showed my office mate that scene as well as the syphillis looking scene (ewwww) but I had to force myself to come back on the second day and watch the last 20 minutes, just to say I watched it. It was just a horrible waste of money. I am quite amazed at the number of positive comments to be honest. Come back Eli and fix this please.Kirk Productions"
3,I want to see Adam Green's Cabin Fever 2,"It's frustrating to think what could've been. Adam Green (Hatchet) wrote a treatment for this movie, but it was and never will be produced. I think the biggest problem this movie has is in its context as a direct sequel. If it was heralded as an 80's throwback gross-out feature and re-packaged as ""Prom Fever"" we all would have lowered expectations and enjoyed it more. In keeping the crossover material, it would've worked better as the second film in a ""Fever"" series, kind of like how George Romero's films work. Also, Ti West is great at what he does, but may have been a poor choice for this particular film. I think Adam Green, however, could have given us the kick ass direct sequel we were all hoping for."
1,buy reading this review you are already wasting too much time with this movie,by writing this review i am already wasting even more time in addition to the time i wasted watching this movie. i guess that makes me a moron. but a moron who took the time to warn you good unsuspecting folks that you're wasting your time. in the words of Bill Hicks : P. O. S. movie.Stop wasting your time reading this. go watch a real movie.
1,The joke is over where is the real movie,I was so upset this was a real disappointment I was waiting for the horror to startbut that never happend. If I was lionsgate I would give everybody their money backand beg for forgiveness. I thought I was watching a remake of the exorcist lol.alan from calif.
2,2.5...disappointing,"Compared to the first movie, this movie sucks. It could have made a mediocre movie by another name. I don't think it did the 1st Cabin Fever any justice. First off, WHERE THE HELL IS THE CABIN? It's kind of like if they were to make Nightmare on Elm Street without Elm Street. It just did not work! I laughed a few times, thanks to some of Winston's lines, I said ewwww a few times because the gore definitely was there, unrealistic but pretty cool anyway. The movie was slow at times, the plot was dumb as well. It takes place at a school prom, so much for the woods and the cabin feel which is what helped to make the original movie so eerie. I did not care for this movie at all."
1,don't waste precious time watching it,"I love horror movies and have seen some bad stuff in my day, but anyone who watches this piece of crap and calls it good filmmaking is just proving to the world they are not a social drinker! This is by far the worse horror film I have ever seen - avoid it at all costs."
5,My favorite book,Callie Bailey wants to be beautiful and popular like her sister Laurel. But Callie has the biggest crush in the world for Laurel boyfriend Jake and the only person that knows it is Addison Callie's bestest friend but theres another problem Addison has the biggest crush on Callie. So one night when Callie is star gazzing with her nerdy friends she wishes on a plantet to make her beautiful so that Jake will love her. Everything starts changing and Jake falls in love with Callie and Callie starts stilling Laurel's modeling jobs. But when Callie thinks shes in heaven she loses the thing that means the most to her.
4,Interesting Insight,"The book is an excellent insight into the way Rockwell generated and composed his ideas. In hindsight if one is familiar with his work, it makes perfect sense. The unspoken truth is his genius in constructing a piece. The are plenty of photo examples to study the evolution of his process. Mr. Rockwell makes the assumption that the reader/artist understands the basics of drawing and painting. This is fine however I for one would be equally fascinated by an expose of the physical painted evolution that was his approach. This matter is left for the most part untouched."
3,Great Music,The CD is one of the best for this group and it was in pretty good shape as far as quality. The music is outstanding and make you feel alive when you listen to it.
3,Quarky Future,"Geneshaft is a story of what the future will be like if it was run and controlled by a tiny secret group of men, and the glory of enhanced genetics, basically controlling a selected population of enhanced humans; 80% woman and 20% men. A mystery alien race of giants wipes itself out with technology and now that same technology threatens to wipe out Earth. It is up to the main character to save the Earth and discover her destiny and humanities new path. It has a disturbing back story, poor development, a pointless plot, and great characters and characters development. The story never goes no where until the last three episodes. Main point of the whole story is about self-determination and girls.Geneshaft - Anime Legends Complete Collection"
3,using kodak,it s ok but when i turn on the camera sometimes it doesnt work (not open/ come out) i dont know why????
3,Great music but poor video production,"While the music on Yes' Keys to Ascension DVD is excellent, and the additional performances (a concert from the 1970s I believe) are great, the actual concert that is the focus of the DVD is marred by video production that is cheesy, with overlaid graphics and animations.I assume this was done because the concert itself is pretty bare bones. No amazing stage or lighting, but the band, on-stage, playing. But to be honest, I would have preferred just to see the band, not the video effects.Commentaries by Chris Squire are pretty good but overall the entire DVD just doesn't feel very professional. I guess this is well worth the money considering how cheap it now costs, but if you want a great Yes DVD, this isn't necessarily it."
5,"Yes-more than a band, its a place.","Everytime i watch this i see something different. Their music , once you know the words, is a mystical journey. Now i see Avatar colors as i watch and listen. This is a must have for Yes fans. Stunning talent on display and of course the philosophy of Yes should be a universal language."
4,"Simple, yet extraordinary","t is a compeling novel with unique descrptons of a modern Native American who is caught between his past and present.Jim ,a half- breed with a blurry past, is struggling with self-identification.While trying to reinvent his lost identity, Jim is offered help from people who love him.However,neither social relations nor cheap wines help him get over his identity crisis.As he gets more involved with his subconcious thoughts and dreams, he starts to become a non-person in the small town of Montana.As he refuses to get help from people who try to bring order to his life, he realizes the liveliness of the land and as a result identifies with it for a regeneration of his soul. Even though,the plot is quite simple, the intriguing descriptions make the novel an extraordinary one.Inarguably,everyone can find certain points or characters to identify with himself."
3,M.F.A. Program Reading,"Basically, the book tells the story of how Jim Loney drinks himself into oblivion and then gets killed by the police. There were few interesting points in the book, but maybe the author was trying to show through the reading how uninteresting Jim Loney's life was. I thought the sister and Jim's girlfriend were strong characters, but since Jim wanted to drink himself to death, I don't think they played much in the book. I read this book because I saw the title on an M.F.A. reading list. Technically, the book was well written, but in terms of subject and plot, it was kind of a bore."
2,Hirohito,"This isn't a bad movie, but it says that Hirohito had no power over his army, but recent evidence has proven that Hirohito was responsible for the tens of millions of lives that were killed by the Japanese. For those that want to know the real Hirohito I recommend reading Hirohito and the Making of Modern Japan by Herbert P. Bix."
2,History lesson rather than a biography,"I found this A&E biography very disappointing. Film footage was devoted more to discussing the war rather than Hirohito, the man."
3,oh stop whinning,"i saw this video on A & E the other night and found it interesting. i was looking for some background and history on the ""scourge of god"" and it delivered - except there weren't a lot of great battle recreations done (but i understand budgets). then i go online to find a book on attila to further my newfound interest in the famous barbarian leader and i come upon this new ""attila battle"" between the video screen writer and some fella named charles king who is the #1 expert in america on the huns. wow that's impressive. so why can't i find a book by you on attila? hmmmm anyway the video was good and i will look into the books and authors both you boys mention. now why can't we all try to love one another."
3,Wrong part,"This was not the correct part, so it was returned. I don't blame the vendor, as there seems to be several sensors , this was just not the one we needed."
1,What was I smoking when I bought this,"I can't believe that this group even came out with an album. I know that it is spanish but at least some stuff that is spanish is managable to listen to. If your looking for good music, don't look here."
1,Crap,"Mexican guys talking about stuff. Should not have the word Pantera in it, for those that ventured that far into the Pantera search results listen to the samples! They are funny as!"
4,Fun mixture of English and Spanish that reads very lyrically,"I read this book and the author's other children's book (Abuela) with my daughters (ages 2 and 4) who both enjoyed them immensely. Dorros does a great job of mixing the Spanish phrases in and repeating words in both English and Spanish that the story flows nicely and children can pick up some Spanish very naturally along the way. The pictures are very fun as well. I highly recommend it, in fact I came here to look for more books by the same author but unfortunately, didn't find any. I hope he has more in the works, we love them!"
5,Cranberries are wonderful,"A wonderful story. We have worn out our Cranberry Thanksgiving and I am sad to say unable to get another, but happily there is Cranbery Halloween. I'd like to have the whole collection, my children and grandchildren absolutely love these books."
5,Farm Faces cloth book,"This book has been the favorite of a friend's son for his entire big life of 2 years and 3 mos. The soft animals all have different textured materials, the colors are great and the animals are realistic and very cute. I want to buy one for my neice who's ""on the way"". Hope it is ""published"" again soon; what a shame to let it fade from being!"
3,Gamer Graffix,"Ok first I would like to say that the sticker it self is very cute and colorful, makes the PSP better than just being plain BUT the down fall is that it only last for about a month then pills off and the glue stuck to the cover of the front, now the back graffix has stayed on nice never pilled off and is still on. I will give the invention a 10 but the over all product a 3 because it doesn't last long at all!!!!! now that they have more stuff out I'm going to order the TRANSFORMER one cuz my son LOVED the movie and see how this one does!!!!Thanks"
1,Expensive Paperweight,"On a PC - this thing rocks... Cinema 4d takes some creative work arounds which is pretty lame tho - so it gets at least one star. The major disappointment however - is when you're on what is now the major player in our industry - a MAC. Absolutely no support. Wait for years - and their developers still say ""Oh yeah - we've been asking companies to help us but they're busy"". This is just as it sounds - pure BS.They've released a product that has become a paperweight for many people who bought it only to realize that something so unthought of is actually true: they don't support Mac OS. Crazy - but true.Very disappointing product. STAY away from all of 3dconnexion if you're a mac user. They may say they support it - but wait until you get all the fine print."
3,Great Content-Horrible Picture Quality,"I agree with Sandra Preston's review of this movie, but can only give it 3 stars due to the quality of the picture (5 stars for content, 1 star for picture quality). The color is all washed out, and some of the color scenes you can hardly tell are in color. This surprised me since generally speaking, A&E does a superb job on the quality of the production."
5,Great sound!,"I bought one of these for my MP3 and was greatly surprised at the quality of the sound. I also use the small rack (originally for a Sony PSP) as a place to put the MP3 player, and it fits perfectly!!! By the way, I think this particular version is being discontinued, so buy now!!!"
4,Best option left for PSP owners.,I used to have the Logic 3 speakers for the PSP but I found them a bit big to be lugging around. The JBL on Tour Plus is a much more compact and better looking option with similar sound capabilities. I might give the Logic system the nod in terms of lows but to be truthful neither unit is going to put out thumping base. The JBLs definitely have clearer sound and much less distortion at higher volume. I do wish there was a way to charge the PSP form the JBL unit like the Logic 3 but I'm definitely splitting hairs there. All in all the JBL unit is a solid piece of equipment with above average sound in a very compact package.
5,EXCELLENT,Good sound and output power for the size. Rugged protective case.This is a really nice-looking and very compact mobile speaker system.
5,Owned 3 years - great buy!,"I bought mine in 2008 after a long search and they have really held up. I use them for my laptop and with my iPods around the house - on trips - and in the yard around the lawn chairs. They are compact - fold up nicely - look good - are well made. And they are pretty dang loud and have decent bass if you are in a confined space, like my kitchen. Out in the yard, these sound a little thin. Batteries last a few hours at high volume, though I almost always use mine plugged into the grid.They weren't pricey in 2008 - I got them for around $50.00. I'm not sure they are worth $150! Really. I love them, but if they were $50 just 3 years ago and are $150 today - well, these aren't antiques, are they? On the other hand, I probably wouldn't sell mine for $100. I wouldn't want to go through all the trouble to find a speaker set that does what these do. So, maybe they ARE worth more than $100. Others seem to think so. Honestly, I think they are one of the best buys I have made."
4,very nice,"This is a very nice product: stylish, excellent portability, can be used with 4 AAA batteries or plugged and there is also a nice case for when it's not in use. At a first glance I couldn't find the battery place: you need to move the middle part of the rubber beneath (according to the drawn arrow) and then open the cover that is all along one side.The sound is sharp and powerful, although basses are not for high expectations (the dimension counts). The adapter for PS can be used for ipods or other mp3 players. You can use it with your laptop for movies, that's great. So far, so good, I would buy it again."
3,defective unit,"I waited for almost a week to receive these speakers and was anxiously awaiting them.Unfortunately, they were defective.They would not play on batteries because the little springwas squished behind the plastic and so, could not make contact with the batteries. they were truly beautiful speakers, wellmade with an excellant hard case for their protection. Unfortunately, I was the unlucky one though.They have excellentreviews on the net."
1,Not a real biography,"A couple of fans pasted together their scrapbooks. The resulting collage is often concise and detailed in the wrong places. It contains heaps of superfluous information, which however can't disguise the fact that the authors haven't got a clue who they're writing about. After reading this, the Gibb brothers remain as big a mystery as they've always been - with the exception of Andy Gibb, whose truly tragic life story is adequately summarized."
1,Reads Like A Fan Letter,"This thick book is incredible in the fact that it offers nothing new!It's a bunch of recycled information that is available anywhere- the authors simply re-tell, in the most uninteresting way possible, stories we've already heard.I'm a Bee Gee buff- I was so excited about this books release.It didn't take me long to realize that the authors had no access to the Bee Gees, anyone closely related to the Bee Gees, and at one point I began to wonder if they even ever listened to a Bee Gees album.This book offers nothing. 600 pages of nothing."
4,A great book for all Bee Gees fans.,"This book entitled, The Bee Gees: Tales of the Brothers Gibb, would be a great gift for anyone that has enjoyed the Bee Gees and their music. The tell-all book has a lot of interesting facts and information about all of the brothers(including Andy). Also, in the back of this very large book, there is a section where all of their songs are listed and credited to their authors. It's a very easy and enjoyable book to read and have in your possesion."
2,A Very DRRRRYYYY Read,"I have to admit, I was a bit disappointed with this one. I have been a big Bee Gees Fan since 1977, and also love to read Biographies, so I purchased this book as soon as it was released. It is an extremely disjointed read - there were a few different contributors, and it really shows - it seems like, as each writer finished a section, they just added the pages to the rest, with no thought to continuity or to the art of storytelling. Also, there are so many different names being thrown around constantly, that I had a hard time keeping track of who was who. It reads more like an encyclopedia than an artful biography with a story to tell. I consider myself a diehard Bee Gees fan, and I had a difficult time making it through the entire book. Definitely not for the ""part-time"" Bee Gees fan."
2,Not a biography at all,"This book purports to be a biography, but, as other reviewers have commented, merely consists of huge chunks copied from magazine interviews, often in a confusing order. What can you make of a book that points out, in one breath, how the Gibb brothers' break-up of 1969 was misrepresented by the media, then proceeds to repeat all the rubbish that was written at the time about what they had supposedly said, presenting it as if it were the gospel truth? Considering how much material they have amassed, it is surprising how many mistakes the ""authors"" have made. For example, they don't seem to be aware that Lulu was present at the famous Jakarta concert. The appendices, alleged to be a complete record of hits and cover versions, are nothing of the sort. Overall, a great disappointment."
1,For Younger Readers Only,"If you are not a Bee Gees fan from the 60's or you just start listening to them recently, this book is suitable for you to get acknowledged on them. Though the events reported in this book are general and already very well known, the book is one of the few about The Bee Gees. Indicated especially for those looking for Disco Fever fans."
1,Boring,"I started this book 2 years ago and I still haven't finished it. Is there anything known about the brother's personalities? It certainly isn't in this book. How about their peak period? Did nothing exciting happen to them? The book is boring. This is not a biography, not even a discography."
1,Poorly organized book,"I read the book carefully and the it's a real shame that the authors did not spend more time on research! Many reviewers complained about lack of information of Bee Gees main asset, their music, I regret to say that it's true. Now, should we wait for a Bee Gees Anthology? Official, Authorized and Informative?"
1,Ultimate Mistake,"The title of this book should be entitled The Ultimate Mistake, how a group ends a succesful tour to large audiences the US and go play in nightclubs back in UK? This and many other issues are not explained in the book. Too many many pages are dedicated to the background of Bee Gees, whereas little attention is dedicated to the major issue of interest, their music. After all who sings lead in a given song? who plays the instruments? who composed what? where's their complete songlist, not to mention the already discussed lack of a decent section dealing with their discography. The book written without any actual input from the Bee Gees misses its point, all information seems more like something written by fans, not to be taken seriously, better save your money and wait for a real book about the Bee Gees and their music."
1,Worthless!,"It's a worthless book for serious fans. No decent discography, e.g., what songs are in Idea or Horizontal? Who are the composers? Who sings? If you interested in gossips and Andy Gibb's addiction to cocaine, etc., then go for it. Casual fans will also be disapppointed with DA Book, no information about anything worth the money you spend in a 700 plus pages book."
5,BOOK REVIEW,THE BOOK WAS JUST WHAT IT PROMISED TO BE- A COMPREHENSIVE STORY ABOUT THE LIFE OF THE BEE GEES.
1,Save your money,"This book had all the necessary elements to be a great book, but it looks like that the ""international cooperation"" didn't work that well. I can't imagine why people bother to write 724 pages about personal problems instead of their music! Their (Bee Gees) achievements are quite outstanding, and the book should focus on that. The missing elements would be irrelevant if we had tons of books about the Bee Gees, but this is not the case. David Leaf's book is still a more complete source (taking into consideration that it's some 20 years old) for their musical opus."
1,New Book Disaster 2000,"I imported this book expecting a complete overview of their 40 years plus career together with some insightfull glimpses of their lives from Isle of Man to US 2000, but when I finished reading the book it was with a feeling of sadness. Sadness for waiting this long for such book written with lack of unit. Furthermore, as other reviewers stated so well, no detailed information about their discograpy, concerts, not even a list of the songs composed by the Bee Gees!!"
5,This is LOADED!,"I host and DJ at g/i events and cd selection is very important when it comes to choosing what music is worthy of taking with me to gigs. Usually on comps there are only one or two good songs and the rest are crap, but this cd set is LOADED. Fast, slow, sensual, and upbeat... I highly recommend this both to the DJ that doesn't have every song already on this comp; and I highly recommend this to anyone who doesn't have very much music who just wants a great sampler and good buy for their money."
5,Enlighten Up with This Deck,"I've had this deck for 20 years and I love it. Nothing to memorize, no esoteric secrets. Even tho it's a cartoon, it gives accurate great readings. The imagery and captions are in modern, new age vernacular with a 70's flavor. Everyone smiles when I pull it out. Easy to read and I hardly ever refer to the book, even tho I numbered the cards to match the entries. People don't find it intimidating and find themselves adding to their own reading. Get this deck if you don't take life too seriously and want to have fun with reading. If you want to mystify people you don't want this one."
2,"Great deck, poor card stock","I bought this deck and it arrived a few days ago, and after just a couple of dealings two cards have split ends because the material they are made from is really cheap card stock without any coating. Also the card backs are printed in the same black ink as the front, despite what is shown on the product images here, which can be confusing when shuffling and using many cards. All in all, I am disappointed with this product, and I will be having to laminate the deck or seek for suitable sleeves. If what the publishers wanted was a disposable product that commanded repeated purchases after it comes apart, nice try. Now I'll draw a card and see what the deck says for itself... ""Keep up the good work"" Love it! The cosmic sense of humor also has a thing for sarcasm. Peace out."
5,Great Book that teaches kids to believe in themselves,This book is about a little dragon who can not make fire. With the advice of an armidillo the little dragon believes that he can make fire and does! This is a wonderfull story and a must for Cosgrove story lovers!
5,"Excellent for ""Inner Children"", too","Beautiful little book with a message that illustrates the importance of believing in yourself, and simultaneously staying grounded in reality. I highly recommend it for those with active ""Inner Children"" as well. Very therapeutic."
3,Good information for beginners,"Body Sculpting Bible, Swimsuit Edition has good information on nutrition, exercises and workout plans and I would highly recommend it for beginners. However, if you are already in an exercise program and are looking for something different, Villepigue's workouts in this book are way too easy and I would recommend Villepigue's Body Sculpting Bible for Women, which incorporates weights and varied and challenging workouts. For someone not accustomed to working out though, this book would be a great beginning."
2,Good for beginners... disappointing for experienced,"Gives basic overview of exercises with mini-weights that probably won't get you the beach body you want.There are better, more realistic books out there (ie: Body-for-LIFE, Sculpting Her Body Perfect). If you're the type who reads Shape magazine, you may like it. If you're a Muscle & Fitness Hers or FitnessRX reader, you will think it's lame."
2,not useful for experienced exerciser,the only people that may find this book useful have either never exercised or are very thin with little muscle tone. I did not find it useful because i have been lifting weights for a few years. The most disappointing thing about the book is that several models used appear to be underweight with no muscletone and are absolutely terrible role models for a HEALTHY female physique.they don't look fit-they look like they don't eat.
3,"Great for Beginners, but you have to be creative to make it advanced","This book is a great one for someone who has never exercised before, because the workouts start out easy and then increase. If you are an experienced exerciser I've found results doing the workout of the day twice (like a big circuit) and with heavier weights. As long as you are willing to push yourself with the weights you are going to lift you can get results! :)"
2,Workouts for the free weight phobic,"If someone has never been in a free weight training room before, or believes that free weights will lead to unseemly ""bulking"" this is a nice introduction to free weight training.However, if a potential reader is seeking a progressive, high impact program this isn't it.James Villepique has authored or co-authored a number of other work-out books which are much better for those who enjoy fitness.If you do enjoy working out, or just enjoy the results, don't waste your money on this book."
1,Not the size shipped,I am not sure if this was a shipping error or not. The 10 drills I ordered were only 3 1/2'' drills ( not 4'') BIG DIFFERENCE!
3,"Great bit- but only 3-1/2"" usable length.","Great bit- but description should be changed to match what is printed on the packaging 3/16"" x 3-1/2""x 6-1/2""I needed a 4"" bit and this was too short."
3,Carbide tip worn down much too fast,"Lets say I really like Bosh and have a few of their tools such as compound sliding miter saw and cordless compact drill - really excellent products. Couldn't say much about this bit. About 20 holes and the carbide tip is completely gone. I was driving this bid with a Milwaukee 18V cordless SDS rotary hammer drill. Never seen anything like this, even my Chinese bit is still going strong. Anyway it could be a manufacture defect. I would keep buying Bosh tools, just not the SDS bits.I replaced this bid with couple of Hilti bits (about the same price as Bosh), happy so far."
4,Good LDS Fiction.,"Not great literature, but a well-written thriller that makes you care about the characters. Doesn't harp on the Church, but there are some expressions that would be a bit weird for non-members. Clean language, clean morals, interesting story. I wish I had the first two! I'll be looking for them."
5,Numark CS-1 Model Styles,Glad I made the switch to this model from the stylus that came with my Ion record player.No skipping and much stable tracking movement within the grooves.
5,Excellent Watercolour Tuition by 4 Artists,"I especially like the way that these four experts have combined to produce a book that covers every aspect of watercolour painting. It is also interesting to note that each one deals with different lessons rather than they all try to teach the same thing in there own style, that way, the sections follow on from one to the other as you move on to the next artist's lessons. I am an ardent follower of the first three artists, having several books and videos produced by them, so know their methods very well and I have found this book to be one of the best watercolour instruction books that I have seen so far.I heartily recommend it to anyone who may be struggling a little with their watercolour painting, as I am, or in fact, to anyone interested in this medium.Enjoy your painting."
4,Fiskars PowerGear Bypass Pruner #7937,"Bypass are being used to cut anything "" green"" within it's cutting capability, and because when you squeeze and cut, the handle you pull up also rotates to reduce figer fatigue, you might lose grip when wearing gloves, so remember to use this line of pruner bare handed, cuts great under normal posture, also with palm down position, not so when palm facing up, so you switching hands to do the job, and that's when you will find out the power gear handle only rotates clockwise, and the design is not useful in your left hand, so left hand user beware."
2,"Works well, but not for left-handers","The rolling action described is perfect for right handed users, as the fingers curl and the lower handle moves toward the palm. BUT if you are left-handed, the curl goes the wrong way, and the lower handle rolls toward the finger tips, resulting in a total loss of power and making the cutter almost impossible to use. Do they make a left - handed model?"
3,You'd think for this price,"that there would be a hole in the handle (or somewhere) that could be used to hang the pruner in the garage. Yet another product where they're not thinking from the user's perspective.It has cut branches quite nicely so far. However, from my experience with pruners, the proof of its ability will come a year or two down the road. I've found that some pruners just don't cut it after repeated use."
4,Product met expectations,The rotation of the handle was perfect which decreased the pressure required. My wife enjoys it as well.
4,nice pruners,these work very well-easy on the hands- I just bought the toro ratcheting pruners for about $11 and they work as good or even better. both good products.
1,Save your money,"Just another bottle of hype. I am a marathon runner and found absolutely no increase in endurance that resulted from taking these pills. They did, however, give me indigestion."
3,placibo?,seems to help me but i don't know if my fitness is peaking or it is mental but even so... works for me.
3,Did not like,"I am a fan of Jackie's Bravo Show and loved her book. Her DVD was lacking for me. Yes, it's a workout - but her instruction is not as good as Jillian or Beachbody. Worth buying used, but not new."
2,Xtreme let down.,"After working out to Jackie circuit training, which I enjoyed and got immediate results, I was not happy with this work-out, I thought Jackie did too much talking and not hanging in there doing the work-outs, I hate trainer who do that, that is why I don't do Julian Michaels workout's. This workout just doesnt seem effective and I cannot see myself getting results only sore and tired muscle with no results. I think this will be my last purchase from Jackie I have most of her dvd and the circuit training is by far my favorite and I will stick to that one, YOU ROCKED!!!in that dvd Jackie you hung in the and the workout was Killer it shaped me up quickly."
1,Skip this one,If you like workout videos skip this one.I did this workout 2x but found it boring. Jackie may be a good trainer in person but not on video I was disappointed and unmotivated she seemed like she didn't want to be there.
3,Not great for lower body workout,"This video was only 30 minutes and when it ended I was just beginning to feel like I was getting a workout. It is very heavy arm & shoulder work. You do arm exercises while doing various lunges, holding them for one minute. I wanted much more in the lower body area which is my problem area. What I did like was Jackie's enthusiasm. I probably will not use this video again."
5,Great work out!,I needed something that would challenge me on days I couldn't get to the gym and as an alternative to Bikram Yoga. I also was looking for something that would keep me from getting bored with other works out I have. I wanted something that required little room in my house and little time. This is it. While this states it a full body workout I find most of the exercises target the arms which I am perfectly fine with. I take this when I travel so that I never miss a beat when it comes to my fitness program. Great buy!
5,Ouch,"This was a short, but killer workout- this is the first of Jackie's that I have purchased. This woman knows what she is doing. workout for strong intermediate to advanced... glad I got it..."
5,Brutal! The best!,"If you want a serious workout, this is the DVD for you. I love it! I cannot believe you can do all that in only half an hour."
5,Very effective,"I like this workout because it's 30 minutes and you sweat, even if is cold.. I do it when I don't have a lot of time and it really helps.. It's a hard workout.."
5,Excellent time saving w/o and kicks your butt!,All I can say is WOW! This is by far an excellent total body workout for 30 minutes! You have to keep good form throughout to get the best results and let me tell you you won't feel wimpy having to pick up your 3 or 5lb weights because after 25 seconds they feel like 25 lb weights in each hand. I do a lot of bar bell lifting at the gym but the compound moves makes those light weights fell heavy. So don't think because Jackie is using lighter weights in the workout that its easy.. let me tell you its not! You will be dripping sweat as well as feel your heart pounding. For days when you can't make it to your gym this is an excellent and quick total body intense workout to get in at home. I give it an A++++++...
4,Tough Workout,"I've only done this video once so far, but so far, so good. I am usually a big fan of Jillian Michael's DVDs as I like a more intense workout. I consider myself a fairly advanced exerciser and this Jackie Warner DVD gave me a run for my money. My quads were screaming and I would have to take breaks. Since you do so many reps, it's best to use fairly light weights like 5 pounds or less. The time went by super quickly and I think it's a good option when I don't have time for my hour and half cardio/lifting days, but still want some strength training. One thing to note is that even though I've only done this once, the banter between Jackie and the two other exercisers were already annoying me at the end. They kept on making jokes EVERY time Jackie went over to them to explain/show form. I got so tired of hearing ""Oh you're coming to me again?"" It's really not funny after the first couple of times."
4,Great workout BUT...,"This is a tough cardio workout and works my legs like crazy. However, there are SO MANY lunges and variations of lunges that I get very tired out but don't end up with much of an upper body workout because I can't keep up on the cardio with more weight. In the end I use this workout only a couple times a month but I love her Circuit Training workout and do that one regularly."
5,Excellent video,"This is by far my most favorite video to date! I have many others, but I tend to use this video far more often. It targets the entire body and in a short amount of time."
4,Thank God its only 30 minutes,"8 minutes into the DVD, I knew why its supposed to ""work"" in just 30 minutes...its slow but intense. Slow, as in, she's really into form and stability. This is my first Jackie Warner DVD and I am a big fan now. Jackie is also, not annoying but not boring either. So that is a plus."
4,Holy $#!%,"I was in good shape (I thought)...I was wrong if my ability to complete this workout is any indication. I hate it but if I want to burn for 30 minutes and have that mental satisfaction after then this is the one I do. 30 Day Shred is easier and I ""like"" better only because I don't have to work as hard. I really like Jackie and this is my first time seeing her (I have not seen her TV show) and I like her...attitude, voice, etc... I will keep letting her kick my butt and maintain this love/hate I have with this video. My favorite is to do a 20 minute cardio before (run or a cardio video) then do this...burn baby burn!"
1,Hurt my back and spine terribly,"This DVD is for seasoned weight lifters and advanced exercisers. I do pilates on the pilates machine, so I'm fit. I wanted to tighten up more, and tried this. I did the side plank and hurt my back and spine. I only did it a few times and this morning I woke up with pain down in the small of my back and down my spine. I do not recommend this DVD at all. You have to be a contortionist to do some of these moves."
1,Didn't really like this,"I didn't care for this workout at all. Also, Jackie has just the type of body that I don't want--way over developed muscles for a woman. I want to look toned, not like a guy.The sound track is awful. I can see why Zumba is so popular as Beto bothers to buy good music to work out to."
5,Much better,"I love Jackie and her workout dvds. I was doing Jillian Michaels 30 day shred and felt nothing even on high intensity and I was over 300 pounds at the time. My husband was a power lifter back in the day and even showed me how to increase my intensity safely with weights, still nothing. I was hesitant to get this because people gave Jillian the edge over Jackie. After doing this workout with proper form and weight, I don't see how that's possible. This workout is short and intense. I was sweating before the warm up ended. I see definition in my upper body starting to form. This is definitely a better workout for me personally over 30 day shred. I would consider 30 day shred appropriate for maintaining my weight once I've reached my goal or for those just starting or starting very big. I started 30 day after losing my first 50 on the elliptical but at my present 260, 30 day shred is not enough. If you want intensity while building muscle and definition, get this dvd."
4,awesome,Was received fast and easy with no hassle. Great work out to get toned and ready for summer. Excited for the results to come!
5,Awesome workout!,"Jackie has created an awesome time saver workout. It's only 30 minutes long, which is awesome for my schedule.The 30 minutes includes the warmup but not the cool down. The warm up gets your heart pumping right away. The cool down is only a few minutes long so it's not too much extra time.All the the move use multiple mucle groups at the same time. You get a good sweat on with this workout!Jackie doess not do all of the moves the whole time with you, instead she monitors the other people in the video and watches their form to make sure it's proper.You do need a weight for this workout, which I didn't know beforehand. But it's ok because I have weights at home. A mat to be used for the moves done on the floor would be helpful. You do each move for one minute, which is nice because you can go slow if you need to or you can speed up your reps.Overall an excellent workout. I sweat about the same amount as if I had done an hour long taebo workout."
5,Incredible!,"I am a bit of a workout DVD junkie....and I don't give many 5-star reviews. Tried this one today and I LOVED it. I've done a lot of Jillian Michaels and Chalene Johnson and have enjoyed them but was looking for something fresh and different. I loved all the compound moves and how challenging they were after only one minute each. I loved that it is all weights but I definitely felt the cardio effect. I also love that she gets straight to the point and doesn't try to be goofy, fake tough or act like she is trying to be an actress. Can't wait to do it again in two days, and also try some of her other DVDs."
2,bulked up instead of lost weight,"I'll start off by saying this is a really challenging but good workout video. I really felt like i got a good calorie burn from it, and she really works your muscles. I think its a harder workout than Jillian Michaels 30 day shred (in a good way.) But the cardio aspect comes from the fact that it's a very lifting weight centered workout. There isn't much by way of moving around.However, my reason for the low rating stems from the fact that it made me thighs and butt huge. I am a petite woman (5'4"", 110lbs) and have a pear shaped body. I work out regularly, mostly with workout videos but some elliptical. I am not kidding when I say after about two weeks of doing this workout I couldn't fit into most of my skirts, dresses, and pants in the thigh/ butt area. So the workout is great if you are wanting to become more muscular, and perhaps lose weight. But be forewarned, it can also make you bulk up in the wrong areas instead of gain lean muscle."
4,Can I please have Jackie's shoulders??,"This is my first Jackie experience, and the lady will work you. She focuses a ton on your shoulders and arms, but I appreciate that. Her interactions with the actors are fake and might induce an eye roll but stick with it, she will get you sweating. Heavily. Her cool down and stretching moves are also super soothing, so I felt awesome at the end of this work out."
4,One of the best!,"I have a lot of DVDs by different trainers and this one is by far one of the best. I've been an active person all my life but I've been consistently working out/lifting weights for the past 3 years. I have almost every Jillian Michaels DVD, etc., etc., etc. - you get the gist. That being said, I was EXHAUSTED after doing this workout the first time. Talk about muscle fatigue! I hate it and love it at the same time! Excellent workout!"
5,Most effective workout in my library,"This is an excellent workout for both strength and cardio. It moves quickly, but each move is held for a minute, so it doesn't feel as though the moves advance before the muscle has been thoroughly worked. The heart is pumping throughout after the warmup ends. Her cool down lacks a quad stretch, but that is easy to add in. I recently purchased Jillian Michaels Ripped in 30, and I would place the difficulty level of this Warner workout somewhere between level 3 and level 4 of Ripped in 30."
5,High Rate Circuit Workout,"I am personally completing my last 2 treatments of Chemotherapy for Lymphoma and was looking for a video to increase my strength and bring up my heart rate. Throughout my treatment I've walking about 1 mile a day and practicing Yoga on my good days.I must say I love the Xtreme and the Cardio Circuit training videos. In 2 weeks I am feeling stronger and the cardio gives me that runner's type high I've been missing all year long.I would recommend this video for all levels, as you can go from no weights to heavier weights as you progress.I am also enjoying her book, ""This is Why You are Fat"". I've suffered similiarly with Chronic Fatigue, Gluten and Celiac issues through my life. Jackie's journey toward energy is interesting and is supported my doctor's diet recommendations.Thank you Jackie! You've also inspired my husband to get into shape! He loves the Xtreme version the best."
2,Not what I thought..,"I read a lot of reviews for this workout dvd and really thought this would be a FULL workout. I knew it would'nt have too much ab work but there is none at all and the core work is not enough to make a difference. this focuses on arms and shoulder work to get you the ""V"" taper to make you look thin. There is leg work also. Its ok.. not a 5 star workout that will give you fast results."
5,Much better than boring P90X and in less time!,"I just read the review of a person who gave this DVD only one star because it ""does nothing for her"", but believe me I train hard and have been doing exercise and competitive sports all my life and this will certainly kick your butt. I was out of bread after 20 minutes. Yes, you MUST have weights to feel it, otherwise is rather light. I love the instructor, she is motivating and really professional, unlike the guy from P90X who is absolutely annoying."
5,WHAT ON EARTH!?!?!,"i do yoga about 3-4 times a week and do a 7 mile walk each day on the weekends. i thought i was in fairly good shape. i thought wrong.i was watching jackie's show ""thintervention"" on tuesday and was so annoyed by the people whining and complaining about the workouts.(honestly some of those people are SO irritating). so i decided to go get this one.i put this dvd in yesterday (bought it at target) and 15 minutes in i turned it off. i think i also may have been crying. this is a dvd that you definitely need to be in really good shape to get through. i'm going to keep trying and hopefully with a couple of more tries i'll be able to do the whole 30 minutes. i swear i never thought i'd have a problem with a 30 minute workout, but this one is TOUGH! i just kept thinking ""thankfully Jackie is not really in my living room because she would be appalled"". today after only FIFTEEN MINUTES my legs are on fire.(yes, i guess i'm one of the whiners!)"
2,CAUTION,"Seemed like a great workout for an intermediate exerciser...until I severly injured my lower back. Unless you are doing the exercises with PERFECT form you are putting yourself at risk. I have been in Physical Therapy, seeing a chiropractor, Orthopedist for over 1.5 years now as a result of moving too quickly, with too much weight without being instructed on proper form."
2,Hmm.,This DVD is very hard and kinda boring. Focuses on arms way too much. The trainer herself is pleasant and not annoying.
5,Good workout,"This is good for people who don't like to spend a lot of time working out. She get every major muscle group.Good job Jackie, lazy people can not even excuse themselves now."
4,My legs are screaming!!,"I did this video for the first time with the modifications, and my legs are screaming. I'm sure I'm in for a world of hurt tomorrow. I think I could get a better workout using weights but I didn't want to push it the first time. If there had been more ab work, I would have given it 5 stars. But all in all a great workout, especially if you have a short attention span like I do, since she switches moves every minute."
2,I still can not sing with confidence,"Very nice vocal instructional DVD (which I needed), but the instruction ended too soon. It did not include instruction on how to control the diaphram; breathing; note transition (cracking); etc. This limited instructional DVD should have been priced much lower than it actually is, so that the buyer could purchace further instruction (I still can not sing with confidence - my voice still cracks). I paid too much for this lesson."
2,"If you want to have a Vocal Training DvD that just sits around, this one is for you","I stopped singer 5 years ago and picked up smoking. So of course when I wanted to go back to singing, I thought it might help to get a vocal training DvD. I wanted to start back at the basics, warm-ups, practice songs, phrasing and the like. This was NOT what I was looking for. When it says beginners, it means BEGINNERS! Like you have no clue what sounds coming out of your mouth is about. From start to finish I was disappointed. The lessons are very slow, corny and extremely boring! The only thing I can say good about it is that there are some technical things pointed out in this DvD that maybe not everyone already knows. Things like stretching the whole body and learning to relax the jaw and other techniques of that nature. Yes, all of this means I regret the money I spent."
3,good story but poor subtitle and package,"This product is the continuation of the Saber marionette J which has a very interesting story line. However, I found that the text of the English subtitles too large and some Japanese words not translated by meaning but only by pronunciation. Hence, if you want to learn the Japanese words in this animation, there may be a bit trouble. Another minor deficiency is the lack of printed documentation indicating what ""Extra"" stuff are there on each disc. You may wish to write them down after you played the disc."
3,Pretty average...,"Saber Marionette J was better.The art changed which is the most noticeable change from J to ""J to X"". In addition the voice acting gets bad too...The original Cherry, Lime, Bloodberry work had a superior production quality over all.This was one I have in my collection only because it continues the J series.Not horrible... but a let down after the J."
1,The worst Steven Seagal movie ever!!,"Don't bother with this one, it looks like he just got a friend to tape him with a hand held video recorder. Plot line was awful, acting was worse! Skip this one and save yourself!!"
3,DEJA VU ALL OVER AGAIN,"If you have seen on Seagal film, you have basically seen them all. Steven Seagal, a student of the Arnold Schwarzenegger school of bad acting, plays a typical Steven Seagal in a picture with no plot twists and nothing to make us think. Early in film Seagal is double crossed by his partner(cop) who shoots Seagal. Forced into medical retirement he takes a job guarding the beautiful daughter of a wealthy business man and former police buddy. Bad guys want to kidnap said daughter. They succeed and Seagal goes ""walking tall"" to go get her back. No plot twists. Nothing unexpected. Just a plain action flick of one ""superhero"" ex-cop beating up the bad guys. The movie was in serious need of a writer, not only for plot, but a few clever lines.F-bombs, silicon nudity"
5,Great Movie,I don't think there's a Steven Seagal movie out there that I don't like or haven't watched. Whenever I see a new movie by him I try to set aside a few bucks and buy it.
2,just ok,it must have takeing one week to make this .can you buy this at .walmart for .99 come on seagal .stop being in low cost movies
1,Don't waste your money,"I don't usually write reviews, but for your moneysake don't rent this, it is horrible in every way from acting to plot to martial arts. I just sat there thinking its got to get better. Even if you like Seagall don't rent it, its embarrassing for him."
1,I must have missed something.,"Looking at the other reviews, I find it hard to believe that we are talking about the same book. Mr. Waggoner is a technically skilled writer but I thought that this book was absolute trash."
3,NEEDS MORE DIMS,"THIS IS A VERY GOOD BOOK BUT, SOME OF THE EXERCISES ARE LACKING AS FAR AS HAVING READALBE DIMS. I AM CURRENTLY TEACHING A INTRO CLASS WITH THIS BOOK AND SEVERAL PEOPLE IN THE CLASS INCLUDING MY SELF COULD NOT READ SOME OF THE DIMS FOR THE PROJECTS. MAYBE YOU SHOULD ADD A 2D VIEW WITH SOME REAL DIMS ALSO."
2,Perhaps a generational thing,"The hard part of any relationship book is getting my husband to read it. In this case I could not force MYSELF to read past the first few chapters. As I read I could tell my husband wouldn't be able to get into this one at all. The woman is supposed to read his side first. I had a real issue with reading how women are being raised to be ""princesses"" and that in most households women are the ones with control. Since I am over age 50, I assume that this book was written for much younger women, as I can't relate the ""princess"" thing to any of my friends when we were growing up. I can relate it to the divorced daddies I dated and how they were raising THEIR daughters after my divorce 20 years ago.Even if my husband could ignore the ""princess"" issue (which I know he would not agree with), he wouldn't relate to the ""emotional hurricane"". I think the title should have been ""Relationships for the Emotionally Immature."""
4,Very informative/good exercises,"I have read most of this book and would recommend it to clients. It really helps to describe how men become ""unavailable"" due in part to childhood experiences and provides exercises to work on changing these patterns. It is also helpful that there is a woman's side so that she can gain understanding of herself, her partner, and to see if there is hope for intimacy in the relationship."
1,Shut down,"This book probably won't help many, definitely not for the long term. In the world of psychology, many things are the opposite of what they seem. A guy may seem emotionally unavailable when in fact he is incredibly sensitive and has finally shut down due to an insensitive controlling spouse. Women, remember that when you treat your husband like a child, that makes you the parent. Very few guys want to make love to their mother. If you are an egocentric controlling woman that dreams of fixing her man, don't waste your money on this or any other self help book. THEY CAN'T help you. Giving a book to someone to read, in order to help themselves, is the height of arrogance. Any guy willing to read this book is probably not emotionally unavailable, but is likely in an oppressive relationship. Those who give this book need to recognize their own destructive behavior and accept their responsibility."
5,Very informative,"This is an excellent book for men and women if your love relationship/marriage has become a constant contest of wills. Or, in my case, your wife claims you don't allow her to communicate with you. You shut your wife down. You want to always avoid conflict/confrontation. It explains how many men are ""hard wired"" (taught by their caregivers)as a child to supress important emotional feelings and how men carry these traits with them into future relationships; How and why these traits are so damaging, and exercises to practice to break free from these damaging behaviors.If I continue with these exercises and maybe re-read this book from time to time, it may well be the key to saving my ten year marriage."
5,Really Hits Home!,"I don't know what made me read this book, I have never heard of it before but I am so glad I did. I have learned a lot about myself and past relationships I have had. I am divorced but still have an amicable relationship with my ex and think that if we had this book it might have really helped us work on our relationship. The book talks to you without all the psyhco babble, it is clearly and concisely written....it speaks to you, not at you. After I read the book, I wrapped it and gave it to my ex as a gift hoping that he reads it. Thank you Patti Henry for telling it like it is."
2,MSM,Many MSM products on the market sold by many manufacturer's. First hand I've discovered most are a poor copy to the original ( very pricey). I have to keep going back to it for results. This one like most showed me NO benefits. Organic did me no good here.
1,rip off,"Probably my own fault for not reading the size of the container, but between the $16 in shipping and the $4 for the 7 oz of product, I got taken. you can buy the same stuff locally for $5 for 3-1/2 pounds. Live and learn. I love the way the picture made it look like it was a pail of Borax. Buyer beware."
3,Somewhat dated,"The book simply ignores the use of ERP systems in the S&OP; area. Actually, by the end of chapter 1, Mr. Wallace mentions that S&OP; provides more results than ERP systems besides being less expensive than those ones. In my view, this statement should only be true under specific premises.Many tools presented along the book may be applicable only to small manufacturing companies. In the present complex business arena where many companies have to deal with a virtually cornucopia of information and complex situations, those tools are of limited use. However, useful teachings are provided throughout the book regarding the necessity to manage a company having in mind a more systematic approach"
4,Excellent How-to Handbook,I found this book extremely helpful in implementing an S&OP; process. The book was easy to read and understand. I ordered it for the whole team as a training tool. Each team member can relate to certain chapters but also understand their role in the bigger picture.Great book!
4,Review,Provides the necessary tools and information we need to move forward with our major project for our organization. Worthwhile!
5,The Rantings of a (Happily) Married Male,"Ellis' book is excellent and a must read for anyone concerned about equity between the genders. Ellis is perhaps too critical of individual women he has known (no one is perfect) and too quick to ascribe their short-comings to feminism, never-the-less his basic arguments that feminism encourages misoandry and discrimination against men are well made and undoubtedly right. Discussions of the book with my balanced wife, who likes men, has led me to believe that there is hope of a middle-way to gender equity, but Ellis convincingly argues this will never occur through feminism."
3,"Ok, but not all it's hyped to be","I read all of the reviews for this book and really had quite high expectations. However, I was a bit let down. The author is in his 50's, so we're not talking about feminism that you see so much today, but what he saw 20-30 years ago, and alot of what he says is colored by that lens.Further, his view of male-female interaction is hopelessly generational... As in, how he perceives women and interacting with women is quite old school, compared to how I, a 22 year old man interact with women. Further, for the religiously minded, this book is full of the author's experiences of sex outside of marriage.So, if you're a young man wanting some current insights on what's going on with feminism today and male-female interactions.... This book really isn't so hot. If you want some perspective on how things have changed and some history on feminism, this book is ok."
4,Can we say DRAMA???,This book was filled with drama and it was funny. I liked it. It was a page turner. Charles Lawson is my kinda guy. This book reminds me of Waiting to Exhale the teen version with the script flipped alittle.
1,WOW...,"I brought this book not knowing what to expect but reading some of the book I was like, no way that this happened. It was a good read but even though it says that it is for teens I don't think so. But it is a good read."
1,One word is worth a thousand pictures: Awful,"The title would lead you to believe that those photos you found in the family bible may more easily be identified after reading this book. Think again. There is only one chapter, Chapter Three, that even comes close to delivering on its promise, i.e., ""Dating Photographs: Clues to Identification."" But even then, this chapter, like the others, is crammed with such drivel as ""..a photo taken in America in 1885 cannot possibly be that of an ancestor who did not arrive until 1900."" What? And another: ""When you present photographs to relatives for identification purposes, you will be confronted with one of two situations. Your relatives either will or will not recognize the faces in the photos."" No, I am not kidding. This is really the advice that is offered. The book is padded out with chapters such as ""The First Step: Identifying the Family"" and ""Public Sources of Information."" In a word, Awful"
3,very basic,"The usefulness of this book to anyone who has spent any time at all with family photos is pretty limited. It covers the most basic apsects of the topic: dates for evolution of the various types of photographs, a little (very litttle) on dress styles, a decent (if dated) bibliography, ideas for gathering photos from relatives, furniture clues, etc. I read it through cover to cover in a day. The 190pp. could have been condensed to about a quarter that length.I found chapter 5 on the technical details of photograph evolution was handy and the (single!) chapter on dating photographs (chap. 3) was decent. Then again a quick google search would have yielded most of this information online.For a basic book on the topic, I prefer Maureen Taylor's more recent Uncovering Your Ancestry through Family Photographs (Betterway, 2000).Far more helpful are the various books on costuming and details of clothing."
3,Average photo review book,Good background review for someone attempting to organize family photos. Sources in back of book allow for more in-depth areas for study.
4,usefull book about algae for beginners and students,"This book gives an excellent overview about the algae of the world. It is suitable for beginners and students, also for more advanced students. Lots of pictures. Well written, so it is easy to read (I think this is important when you start out on a new subject)."
3,The Movie,"The movie was good. Grace Kelly played the part of the princess well as did Louis Jourdan in the part of the lovestruck proffessor. The movie was well cast, and altough I was somewhat skeptical of Alec Guiness playing the part of the prince, I was not disspointed in his adaptation of the role. Overall, this was an enchanting, bittersweet romance not to be watched without a box of tissues if youre quite the romantic. I recomend this movie. Although I was also wondering... does anyone know where I could find the music to this movie??"
4,Enchanting!,What a lovely movie! Grace Kelly was at her most beautiful and Louis Jourdan was so handsome and convincing as the young professor so deeply in love. It just broke my heart when he had to turn the princess away knowing that they just couldn't be together given their different stations in life. How I wish the ending were different! A wonderful movie all the same for fans of Grace Kelly and Louis Jourdan.
1,"Poorly designed product. Does NOT fit 32"" Polaroid.","This is listed as a universal mount, fitting LCD TV's up to 42"" in size. I own a 32"" Polaroid, and this unit is WAAAAYYYYYYY too small. It's total width is only about a foot, and the mounting holes on my TV are much further apart than that, as are most on TV's of this size that I have seen. If you read some other reviews on Peerless brand mounts, you will see that this seems to be a habit for them: Lying about the size to get you to order a mount that at first glance appears to be a good deal. Now I have to return this at my expense, and get a larger one. Go with another brand that won't trick you like Peerless does."
5,Very pleased,This tv mount is very easy to install and fits perfectly on my TV. You only need to screw it onto one stud so distance in between studs is not an issue. Would recommend. Great value
4,Peerless Universal Tilt Wall Mount,"Installed the mount last week. It was easy to mount to the wall once you locate the center of the wall stud. I have a 32"" LCD TV on it and it is very secure. Very satisfied. Good price"
4,Great Design--But Be Sure it'll work for your Wall type,"This mount is superbly designed and priced right, but just know that this size model for smaller TVs will not span the length between two wall studs 16"" apart (the standard spacing for most sheetrock walls). A1 Books does not take returns on these racks so, you'll be stuck with it...as I am."
5,why pay more??,Mount worked just as it should for Sharp Aquos LC37D43U. Holes for cabling and outlet worked like a charm. I shopped around a bit for a bracket and can't understand why people pay over $100 and sometimes nearly $200 for a one. A fool and his money are soon parted.
2,Sturdy mount but not well thought out.,"This mount is certainly strudy enough for my 32 LCD but I was surprised at how difficult it was to install. I am a fairly handy person, but this mount was just not thought out well. It does not have indvidual holes for each VESA configuration, it has several long slots. Choosing the slot that they seems to suggest (hard to tell from the directions) placed the lower to VESA holes on my TV directly behind the pivot pins, so it was next to impossible to get the bolts in.Also I did notice it anywhere on the description, but mine came only with security bolts, meaning that you must use the supplied bit to assemble or dissassemble, if you lose it I don't know what to do.Strength wise it certainly seems fine, I am not worried about the TV coming crashin down."
2,"Works, but with some modifications","We ordered this product on the same day that we ordered two other ones to fit larger flat panels. We opted to pay for shipping to get this one quicker than the others that were shipped with the free shipping. It took five days longer to recieve the one that we paid for shipping. Also, this one was bought to fit 32"" flat panel and it fit the TV, we just couldn't get it centered due to the small size of the brackett and lack of adjustment to secure to the wall studs. A piece of plywood was used to get it centered."
5,The Passive Solar Compendium,This is the design authority for energy crisis 1.0 passive solar design. Very appropriate today.
1,Base on fiction,"I have seen this video, well I have to tell you it is the worst I have seen. There is little or no reserch. it's mainly taken from the newspapers of the day. I don,t remember seeing anything in the video that was true. It is real bad. He's a fact you most likely will not believe. Bonnie Parker never killed anyone. never even shot a gun at anyone. Never stepped foot in a bank. She never was in on the actual robbery. She was always in the car waiting. not as a driver just waiting. don't believe it do you."
1,Unimpressive,"There is about enough content in this book for a Stocks and Commodities magazine article, but not a book. The creation and use of simulated data is better covered elsewhere, whether off the internet or perhaps a book such as Chande's Beyond Technical Analysis.This book is heavily padded out with endless tables of generated data (one example would have sufficed) and endless charts of generated data. The charts are not presented in a very useful way - they are sideways on the page, labeled in small print, and the generated data is of a different length than the actual data, so it is difficult to compare.However, one thing is clear from the charts, and that is that Barnes' methods for creating simulated data don't pass the test - they don't look like the markets they are supposed to simulate. However, his ""price vector"" model is an interesting idea, and conceivably provides a starting point for additional research."
5,Stunning all around,"This is a superb book for anyone interested in American quilts of the 20th century. I was intrigued to discover that Marie Webster's designs, introduced to the public as early as 1912, were the originals from which ""traditional"" quilt patterns of the 1920's and 1930's were derived. These include the sunbonnets (gentle here, not saccharine), the poppy applique, and the medallion floral appliques. Also, it was an eye-opener to see Webster's dogwood and sunflower designs, extremely close variants of which were popularized years later by a manufacturer of quilt batting. The photography is excellent, and the book is printed on beautiful heavy-stock paper. The essays (written by Webster's grand-daughter) are joyful and respectful and a pleasure to read. The book includes patterns for 12 of the quilts shown. I can hardly wait to get started with my needle."
5,chillin,this cd is chillin. if you like jurassic 5 and high and mighty you'll like this. blackalicious has amazing lyrics and good beats. this cd was my best buy ever and i'm hopin that blackalicious will come out with another one. I sure hope you come out to buy this cd because its probanly the best cd since high and mighty's home field advantage.
3,RAPID FIRE ACTION,"This volume in the Executioner series was written by Mike Linaker, a writer of over 24 plus books for GOLD EAGLE.This book has action aplenty from the first page to the last. It is almost a non-stop action book from cover-to-cover. Unusual also that Bolan gets pretty beat up, cut up and shot up in this one. Plot is nothing out of the ordinary: trying to stop the Columbians from bringing drugs into Jamaica to ship to the U.S., however, the writing is top notch and reads very well. You might, however, be out of breath by the end of book as Bolan is almost on a treadmill concerning timing and action. Bolan as somewhat usual is a 'lone wolf' in this story and the ending is a rather good one.From the publishers of the most popular action/adventure on the market today and for the last couple decades as well. GOLD EAGLE soars as no other series of books has done.Stay frosty."
1,Disapointing,"Terrible, strong taste. Too thick and crumbly. Taste overpowers whatever you eat on it..I was hoping for a good product. Miss eating hot dogs on bun."
2,Not there yet,"My family is gluten intolerant. Was hoping for a roll that replaces the good old one made from wheat flour. Has the same shape - albeit larger - but the bread overpowers the taste of a hot dog..I did find that if you remove most of the inside part of the bun and put in two hotdogs that the taste improves and its not so ""bready"". Was not overly impressed but since we cannot eat wheat this so far is the best I've found.""in the valley of the blind, the one eyed man is king""."
1,Not much luck with these,"The first shipment of these I received were moldy and had to be thrown out. Amazon was nice enough to send me a new shipment, but they were soooo dry. I tried microwaving them and sprinkling them with water, but they were still practically inedible. I gave one star for Ener-G making a hot dog bun I *could* eat (I'm vegan), but unfortunately I don't *want* to eat them. I'm quite disappointed."
2,Slow Shipping,Very dissappointed with the shipping delays. Ordered for a child with food allergies and time is of the essence.
4,Mostly satisfied,This product was delivered in a timely manner. My whole family enjoy this product - both taste and texture are very good. The only reason I have not given the hot dog buns 5 stars is that one pack has gone mouldy - several months prior to the exparation date and within a sealed pack! A review of packaging perhaps?
2,Okay,"These were okay. I didn't like that they weren't presliced. They were VERY thick & heavy. My daughter liked them for the novelty of eating a bun again... but finished the hotdog by itsself after trying half of this.. (She threw the rest away.) You have to microwave or cook these first. They were more trouble than they were worth.I wish they'd make them with the same recipe as their ""light"" white rice bread loaf... they'd probably be really good..."
5,Staggering,"The Chicago Tribune called this ""Marvelous...a throw back to classics like Casablanca"". I concur. Though I never thought I would compare a movie to Casablanca, this movie is a rival in excellence. It has an awsome attention to detail, and an inspired use of resonance. Details in the beginning resonate throughout the picture. I was deeply affected by the ending, and I did not want to leave the theatre. No movie I have watched in recent times has packed such a punch. I saw it today, and I will be thinking of it for some time to come I am sure."
5,A Wonderful Story in prewar Budapest,"This moviehad been shown on European TV channels several times.A beautiful woman between two men, beautiful music in a restaurant setting. A very european movie, if you like Europe you will like this movie."
2,"Compilation of ""Do it yourself"" remixes",This is Olivia Newton-John herself singing (not Unlimited Beat as described). The producers have remixed some of her classic tracks to varying degrees of success. It's interesting... One for the serious collector only.
1,Functional but not something to show off,"While it functions perfectly as an abacus, it does not look or feel that great. The workmanship is not very good either. A bead crumbled on me and the frame was not squared away. In addition, the backside of the abacus is rough. Two stickers are adhered to it and they leave a residue when you take them off as well.Also, don't get this thing wet as it will bleed red and black ink, or a mixture thereof, and cause the beads to fall apart. The lacquer, if you can call it that, does not provide very good protection against moisture.I would save your money for a more robust and well-made piece."
5,Great product,I found this to be very well made and easy to use. It is also nice to look at so I don't mind leaving it on my coffee table when company is over. It is actually a great conversation piece.
3,Quality lacking,"Ok for a little decoration, but I would advise you step up to the next level as far as purchasing a workable abacas."
5,hunger fighter,i believe that this comic book is rare. i am glad that i got this comic book. i only ever seen 1 of these before and that is the one that i bought i do not know if they are rare or i just was not looking hard enough. but a collectable to have.
2,There are better cameras out there,"When I got this camera, I liked the fact that it was 7.1 MP and had 7x optical zooming in such a compact design. However, I am disappointed by the image quality of this camera. When in under bright lights and ideal conditions, the image quality is good. However, in low light or if you turn the anti-shake off, the image quality is horrible. It is too bad because I really wished this could be a good grab and go kind of camera. But I've had too many unexpected blurred pictures to really give this camera a good review. I gave it 2 stars because the image quality is quite acceptable if the conditions are good."
4,The Peanut Farmer We Wish We Could Be,"This is a film that explores the life of our 39th president, Jimmy Carter. The biography takes you inside the life of one of our most moral and upstanding citzens to ever ""hang his hat"" in the oval office. After the film is complete, the viewer is left to think that this was indeed a man of both character and grace: providng in us a sense of longing for someone like him, to return to the White House. The biography takes the viewer on a detailed ride through his days in Georgia, the military, The Presidency, and concludes with Carter's return back to the place where this brilliant life all began, Georgia. This is a biography that will inspire us all, and leave us to hope, that if we try real hard, we can one day reach the ""Moral Precedent"" that this great man has set."
3,DOS GRANDES SINALOENSES,"PURA RAZA MASIZA , MI COMPA ES EL PAPA DE LOS POLLITOS ,VIVA CHALINO PLEBADA ARRIBA MI SINALOA, CHULADA DE PUEBLO"
4,"Excellent, but maybe not enough","This is indeed an excellent book. Witty and insightful, but sometimes the ease, with which you're lead through it, is in the way of stressing the really important stuff. If you are learning diagrams for the first time, and intend to do some serious research using the technique, I believe this book is just not enough: it will leave you unprepared to do much beyond the problems in the book. You might want to consult a more rigorous book, like that of Abrikosov et al., but the style may be a bit of a shock to those not used to the Russian ""condensed writing"". As an introduction that is less painful, and more of a textbook, I suggest Fetter and Walecka's book, though it's out of print."
2,Nice but could be better,"Anyone considering buying this DVD should note that it was done in 1994. This DVD gives a cursory review of Mike Tyson and does NOT include his professional and personal battles after prison. The interviews are good and keeps a steady pace, but more could have been said."
2,one of A&E's weaker efforts ....wait for TYSON or buy the Ringside DVDs,"Hi,I can't recommend this DVD unless you can buy it for under $5. There are ""stills"" where fight footage should be and too many non-important talking heads blabbing about Mike and not enough Mike talking. The new movie ""TYSON"" is out in the UK and will be out over here soon and is much much better. The two out of print ESPN DVDs are both HIGHLY superior to this tabloid styled bio DVD. I'm very disappointed in A&E; , they usually deliver."
1,too detailed,"I got this book for my husband who wanted to find out more about this time period. But it is just way too detailed for the casual reader. For instance, he was not interested in the clothes of that period."
1,Lock jams under normal weather and vibration on hitch,"After 6-9 months of installation on the hitch, the lock is jammed and the key will not open it. Just normal weather and vibration with the lock installed on the hitch. Key turns but will not release lock. Stainless steel push button REESE design."
1,A Piece of Junk!,"STAY AWAY FROM THIS LOCK. After only a few months of use, the lock jammed and I had to hack saw this lock off the receiver. Thinking that some water may have gotten in, I purchase yet another one and only used it occasionally making sure to take the hitch off the receiver and storing the lock in the garage. This morning, the lock could not be opened and I ended up grinding the bolt in two to get the lock off the hitch.I have other weather resistant locks for other applications that have been in use for years, without a bit of trouble.Reese...you have a problem which is only damaging your reputation."
4,It's like finding new friends!,"I've read both of the Cassandra Shipton novels by Ms. Riccio, and have enjoyed them. It's nice to read about people who act like you do, especially if they're involved in an adventure that you probably won't see in your own lifetime! I have to admit I did feel that both books could have been slightly longer, some of the important parts get tossed off, in my opinion. It seems like the characters who die should be introduced to us earlier, to be made to mean something to us, so that their passing is more devastating. At any rate, I am looking forward to the next installment! www.moonchildiva.com"
5,Mesmorizing,I really enjoy they way these women are portrayed. I feel that Cass and her eccentric crew have what so many wiccans aim for. The struggles between crossing the line and staying in tune with nature and the light side of magick. Bravo to Dolores Riccio. Each book has me rushing through to see what will happen next. I'm eagerly awaiting each new book. Please keep up the great work!
5,Fun Decorating Ideas,"I love Mark on While You Were Out and saw him on the Tony Danza show...really don't go to dollar stores much but after this book and all the FABULOUS ideas, I'm hooked. The book is amazing and the ideas are fun! I've made tons of gifts for friends and my apartment. Mark is ahead of his time!!!!!"
4,Very cute,"alot of it is very cute but also no longer common house hold items, still love it tho and im going to try some out"
5,Fun and affordable,I love this little book - it gave me oodles of ideas. My Grandbaby grabs it and picks out a project everytime she visits.
1,Dollar Store Decor: 100 Projects for Lush Living That Won't Break the Bank,"I ordered this book thru [...] and altho they said it shipped, it never did and they refunded my money. I knew I would get service with Amazon.com. The book arrived in a few days and is in very good shape. However, I do not like this book. I was disappointed with the ideas and craft projects. It is not what I had hoped for. Anyone want to buy it from me?!"
4,Much more than just shutter speeds.,"I don't know which book the other reviewer of this book was reading, but my copy has far more information than just ""fast shutter speeds to freeze action, slow to blur"".This book has a lot of really good information. There are hundreds of examples, and clear information about composition is given. Special attention is also given to more complicated action situations such as low light situations, or those with difficult lighting.One thing I love about this series is how each photo is accompanied by the details of how it was made, including location and event, photographer, camera, lens, film speed, exposure and lighting."
3,Pictures can be deceiving...,"I had bought a granada cross for my wife aboard an airplane, some years ago, and she was robbed at the Dolphin Mall, in Miami, a paradise for pickpockets and thieves.I then bought this replacement at this site, and was disappointed because it is much smaller than the picture led us to believe. The product is ok, and the price is not far off, but we were expecting something larger."
3,Steve Madden shoes are decent,"The Darring Pumps are cute, but they're not very comfortable. I wouldn't suggest them if you need to stand for long periods of time."
4,Solid Help for Learning Techniques,"I used this book to help me learn the forms given, and found it very useful. I have since lent it to other students, who were similarly helped. The pictures demonstrate the techniques very clearly. The one lack is that the patterns are somewhat difficult to follow as far as direction - this requires careful reading of the text, but diagrams would have helped."
3,Disappointing,"I didn't realize this was a photo book of entries in a contest. I had thought there would be patterns, etc, so it was disappointing to me."
3,ALL ONE WAY TRAFFIC,FOUND THIS BOOK VERY INTERESTING BUT IT WAS ALL ONE WAY TRAFFIC.. I REALY GOT INTO ALL THE STORIES AND IMAGINED AT TIMES I WAS ACTUALLY THEIR INVOLVED WITH EVERYTHING THAT WAS GOING ON.. THE ONLY DISAPPOINTING THING WAS THE FACT THEY NEVER SEEMED TO GET DONE. THEY ALSO SEEMED TO BELITTLE THEIR CLOSEST RIVALS AT TIMES BUT I MUST ADMIT THEY WERE AT THE TIME AWESOME BUT NOT INDESTRUCTABLE AS THIS BOOK LEADS YOU TO BELEIVE.
5,True Hammers,"This is by far the best account of football Holliganism ever written. Cass Pennant gives living accounts of the ICF adventures throughout the EPL and Division II. This book keeps you entertained and you are fulfilled with the knowledge of the greatest Firm in all of England. From the beginning to the end you cheer on the Mighty Hammers supporters as they thrash through Stoke City, Chelsea, Liverpool and of course Milwall. You will be singing Forever Blowing Bubbles to your children as they sleep by the end of this phenomenal book."
5,Excellent from start to finish,"Its not unusual to see black people atfootball matches these days but back in the 70's and early 80's therewere a lot of skinheads on the terraces and they were mostly extremeright wing racists. I didn't go to football at all in the UK in the70's but I remember going to see my first England match in 85 andbeing quite shocked by some of the racist chanting from some sectionsof the crowd at our own players. In short if you were black andstanding on the terraces behind the goals (where all the hardcorefans gather) then you were seriously hard. Cass Pennant was that, a feared man as well. His writing is clear and focused, and this book is a great account of West Ham United's main firm, the Inter City Firm. Their rucks with rivals are still spoken of with awe, and one didn't venture into their turf on a game day without expecting to catch a beat down! Wild tales, especially to us Yanks!"
5,6 stars,"If there was a way I could rate this book higher than 5, I definately would.If you are a fan of incrediblely well written action, Christian themes, powerful topics, well-researched fighting techniques, and an all around good story... this is for you. Even if you dont' like action, you should get this.One of the many reasons this book is so incredibly awesome is because on one character. Gage. He is the best of the best. The author researched every type of fighting to make this character. All the way from more-than-advanced knife techniques, to war tactics.To state it simply: Get this book."
5,Mr. Huggins is AWESOME..,"I havent even read this book and i cant put it down...Ive read cain, wolf story, and leviathan...im bout to read hunter...All Mr. Huggins books are great.....its hard to put them down! I started reading cain...it was ok...but then i actually started reading it.....it was so great i couldnt put it down...im 14...and most 14 year old athletic guys dont think twice about books.....and thats what i thought....I read it all and needed another book to read. so i got leviathan by huggins.....again at first i thought it was going to be boring....But i read a lot...then i read the rest of it...awesome! Then i had to get another book....I was going to get the reckoning...but they didnt have it... so i got wolf story...great book also... Steve alten is also a great author read meg and the trench... ok cyas"
5,Fresh insights on timeless truths,"Father Keating's haunting, exquisite reflections on the Scriptures and liturgy bring new depth and freshness to passages one may have heard a hundred times - but which, with each chapter, seem refreshingly new. For example, his treatment of the Annunciation, John the Baptist, and the parable of the Prodigal Son, and the continuing call to holiness in each incident, presented beautiful truths in an engaging, casual, and deceptively simple style. Father Keating's words about the ""double bind"" (doing God's will when two ""callings"" seem contrary), which he applies to the Passion of Christ itself, are intense food for thought, and he skillfully presents them in terms which are very easy to understand. Excellent work for anyone interested in the spiritual life."
5,The Pearl of Great Price,"I use this book more than any other when I am planning classes on spirituality, liturgy, Scripture study or prayer. It invites us to experience the mystery of how Christ is present in our own lives. It is clearly written. It is an excellent starting point for planning Advent, Lent, and Easter liturgies or retreats. I read it as if it were a map that that describes what I may encounter as I attempt to follow Christ. Students have been enthusiastic in praising this book because of its clarity and the insights it offers."
5,Deep read!,"This is an awesome book! Thomas Keating's insight is spot on! It is a deep read, but very worth it!"
5,Very good approach to architectural matters,"I think that this book has an excellent approach to architecture and scalability matters in .NET. The 3-tier example gives you a good look about object-oriented architecture. It is possible, from there, to apply remoting or web services to improve the application's performance and scalability. Well done!"
1,COMPLAINT,I also had the same problem as the previous customer. I ordered an item from here a boxing bag for my sister's b-day/xmas present. I waited and waited and there was no sign of it. I know it will sometimes take a week but 2 weeks or more is a little much. I had to cancel my order for fear that it would not arrive in time for christmas
2,Where's my stuff,First I ordered because you said 1 to 2 business days. That was November 30. Now it's December 6 and I was checking and it will not arrive till HOPEFULLY Dec. 13 thru Dec 19 I HOPE BEFORE CHRISTMAS As I could have bought it locally for this time span. Can someone find out what is really going on. Thank you
1,not the real scent,"I used it immediately as it is my favorite scent. I have been buying it in expensive stores and lately it has not been available, so when I found it at Amazon.com I went for it, but the scent is not the same, it is not the scent of My Couture which I'm used to. This to me smells totally different, nothing like the real thing. I feel this is a knock off. Do not buy this. It looks the same and all, box looks the same but believe me the scent is not it. It is too strong, at first, has no particular smell, it is not attractive, other people do not notice it, and it is rather chocking. Wasted money. Should be investigated."
3,X10 system,"I have used the X10 system for over 20 years with success but it was damaged by an electric line problem. Radio Shack was the original supplier, but has stopped supplying rhem. I bought the new system on Internet but hsve had problems The main fault is in the Mini-Timer, which is too small for adult fingers to pressa one button only. It also has a clock which cannot be read in daylig.v e also been erratic. This equipment is not as good as the old ones. Amazon has ordered these systems very well. My only complaint is with the Manufacturer."
3,Life and Work of Dwight L. Moody,"The book is a photo copy of the original (which is no problem), however, there was a very large section of pages that were copied twice! That made the book much larger than necessary. The quality of the book is what made me give it 3 stars. The content would be 5 stars."
4,Funny storyline,"I am always looking for ""animal"" stories to interest my daughter. This author has written many stories that keep her interest and The Invisible Dog is no exception. The story is simple, a girl wants a dog, her parents are reluctant. The girl finds an old collar and leash and imagines her pet. Through a series of remarkable coincidences, her dream comes true at the end of the story."
3,"book good, quality of paper and printing poor","When I read the review of this book I thought it would be good for my 7-year-old grand-daughterwho had a smiilar experience and was still mourning the loss of Labrador. I liked the topic and the story. However, I was stunned by the gray pages and dark print of the book. I didn't expect a Disney type picture book, but books for children should, at least, be on clear, strong, good white paper. The quality of this book reminded me of the books put out during and after WWII when the paper industry was just beginning to recycle paper. What a disappointment. I was embarrassed to give my granddaughter this dingy looking book."
5,"Tales of the Slayer, Volume 3 (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)","The 'Tales of the Slayer' books are a brilliant collection of short stories about the past and present slayers, including stories about Nikki Wood,the first slayer, and even some tales about Buffy herself. You may be a bit disapointed though, because this volume only contains 4 tales unlike the other volumes which contain around 8-10,but, what you will not be disapointed about is the quality of the stories inside."
5,Great book!,"I ordered this to suggest it to my boyfriend to read. It's a great book, I owned it once but it was stolen, guess it was just that good. Glad to own it again!"
3,JIR's been funnier,"As an avid reader of the ""Best of JIR"" books for many years, I didn't find this volume nearly as roll-on-the-floor funny as previous volumes. However, there are some real gems in here."
5,FUEGO ETERNO - Will Remain in my Heart,"This CD includes many emotional songs. If anyone has ever had their heart broken, this CD will definitely mend their heart. I love it!!!"
5,"Intocable - Don't touch them, they're HOT!!!!","This is the untouchables first effort and it contains the best song that tejano music has ever heard: VETA YA. This song jams!!! Although they sound like Ramon on this album, it still is great! One problem, what's with the cover? It looks like they're about to go to church or something. What a cheesy cover. They get better though...."
3,"Good info, not many solutions","Like the title states this book tells you about a lot of security issues you should be aware of, but doesn't go in depth for many solutions. Especially xss which is the only reason i bought the book. For how much the book costs i figured it would include some really good php solutions. I mean the thing is in black and white, what's with the price tag that doesn't tell me anything that i can't find on the web."
4,Good reference book,"I wanted to learn how to design web application with security in mind. This came in very handy at that time. I know I know that in this digital age everyone prefers Kindle or online book, but I am little conventional, I like to have my books. This was definitely worth investment. This is not for the people who wants to learn PHP, rather for the ones who already knows PHP and want to learn security aspects of it."
3,Seems to be a glitch.........,"I wanted something for trimming my moustache & beard other than something made in Pakistan. Germany's cutlery has always had a wonderful reputation. These DOVOs look great, seem to cut hair nicely, BUT the description here, in my estimation, is misleading. It says ""serrated blades"", which to me, would tend to hold those pesky lip hairs in position for cutting much better than something with no serrations. Well, even with a 10x magnifier, I couldn't see any obvious serrations. NADA! ZILCH! Smooth as the proverbial babies patootie! Now maybe they had a rough day in Germany when they made this lot. But if serrations aren't an issue, why even mention them? It's the culminating reason I purchased them. Haven't called the company yet, but plan to. Disappointing."
5,Frustration Abounds,"The reader is transported through Ehrhart's painful struggle to cope with the aftermath of the Vietnam war. Ehrhart is an outstanding writer and each pages is drenched with his energy and anger. For fans of his poetry, or the anti-war movement, this volume frames the frustration felt by returning vets very well."
2,Not For Young Kids,"I bought this for my 6 year old nephew, big mistake! He is crazy about marine biology and will probably color the pictures, but the text is for adults."
3,Almodovar Old and New,"I gave this box set three stars because I had to re-purchase the most recent Almodovar films in order to get the two old treasures from when Almodovar was mostly known as a ""gay interest"" filmmaker: ""Matador"" and ""Law of Desire."" These are the first two great Almodovar films that were widely distributed on video in the USA, and for any long-term Almodovar fan they definitely are worth having now on DVD. That said, they are extremely raunchy (even moreso than ""Bad Education"") and may upset newer fans who are familiar only with Almodovar's recent ""women's pictures"" such as ""All About my Mother,"" ""Talk to Her,"" and the new ""Volver."" Still, even these fans will enjoy ""The Flower of My Secret,"" ""Live Flesh,"" and the feminist comedy classic ""Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown,"" expecially if they didn't catch them in their previous video incarnations."
2,arrived late but good condition,"I received this a week later than estimated for delivery. I contacted the seller and she verified it was sent out weeks prior. We couldn't understand where it was. Once I received the book, it appeared the seller had written the wrong zip code for my address and it was MIA in the postal system for awhile. The book was in good condition when received"
4,very useful and interesting way to look at organizations,"This is a business book for an English major! No really, if you like to think metaphorically, you will enjoy this book because it gives several models for understanding organizations. The organization as an organism, as a brain, as a physic prison, etc....At the end of each chapter, the author summarizes and then states the limitations and advantages of each metaphor. The final chapters are devoted to applying these approaches to real examples. As far as business books go, I found this one very interesting and more holistic than most. Maybe that's because I was an English major."
1,Tsonga shoe sizing,"I ordered these shoes and when they arrived, they didn't fit. I returned them and reordered requesting the size I ordered. They had sent sz. 8.When the second pair arrived, they were the very same size. Evidently, the company doesn't know the difference between US sizes and EU sizes!!So I cancelled the order completely."
2,SLOOOOOOW,"I use an adding machine throughout the day and I am tired of always waiting for this one to catch up to me. Prints slow and if you are going to use it more than once a year to do your taxes, it will annoy you."
3,Long on features; very short on documentation,"I bought this calculator through Amazon to replace a failing TI model that had served me WELL. I selected this particular model because it appeared to meet my (household-basic) needs, provided printed output and had large character display. It does indeed meet my needs (and much more) but it took a while to figure out key function, symbology and key stroke sequences. I mistakenly discounted its prior reviews about poor instructions and paid a significant penalty in doing so. What instructive material was provided with the calculator was sparse and of little help. And I found no relief on the vendors web site."
1,don't waste your money if you want a printing calculator,"The paperfeed was so week that by the time we used 1/2 a roll of calculator tape, it no longer advanced the paper. So your numbers all print on top of each other. Waste of money."
4,calculator,I bought one very complicated for what i needed but now have figuired out how to use it for my simple needs
3,once loaded it was great,It was difficult to thread the roll of paper into the machine.The machine itself worked well. It came a few days later than I expected. I would pay the extra charge for quicker shipping if I had it to do over again.
3,Agreed all around,"Many other reviewers have already made the point, I can only affirm it. For the price, it's a great calculator but the instructions are awful and very difficult to follow. I ended up spending $12 after the fact for replacement ink cartridges because not only are the directions/illustrations unclear about how to install the ink cartridge, but if one is not careful, the cartridge slips out of your fingers and easily becomes irretrievably lost inside the guts of the calculator. (I can hear it rattling around in there, but cannot get it out.) Be warned, local supply stores' listing of replacement cartridges will not have this model listed in their stores, so be sure to ask and make sure that you get the proper replacement cartridge (the HR 100 is NOT the same as the HR 100TM; I learned the hard way.)"
5,A Machine You Can Count On,"For the money, and for general office use, this is a great printing calculator. I have owned a number of Canon and Casio printing calculators but I think I've found the best one to date with this Casio model. I am especially appreciative of the extra-large digital display."
4,Good product-great delivery service,"I bought this calculator because my elderly mother wanted one that prints a tape. I was very pleased and surprised to receive the product within 2-3 days because I purchased it just one week before Christmas. The biggest negative for me is that the only instructions are very difficult to read and comprehend, and do not address basic usage - such as inclusion of something identifying the purpose of each of the keys and examples of simple mathematical functions. Accountants are not the only people who want to calculate with a paper tape; elderly people and less skilled users also want this feature."
4,Nice size,I am still having to learn how to use this calculator. I was used the the inexpensive ones from the Dollar Store. You will need to take the time to read the instructions.
5,great buy,"It's nearing income tax time, so I ordered this calculator to facilitate my figurings. Lovely display, fast action, very good price--everything I could want in a calculator."
4,Seems good,"Only used this a little so far, but I imagine as I do more and more accounting for our business, it will come in very handy."
2,INADEQUATE INSTRUCTIONS,"I ordered this as a beginner. I use a normal calculator. Im trying to do my business accounting, so I decided I needed a printing calculator, to keep track of whether or not I actually added ALL of the figures correctly. Sadly, I am very distraught with this 'simple, easy to use calculator'. The Casio 100-TM instruction manual is vague, confusing, and does not approach providing instructions for full use of the calculator. It left me ""clueless"" as to the multiple functions and how to use them. I don't know what any of the buttons mean or how to use them. The ink roller which came with the calculator was dried out. It came with a very small roll of paper. Furthermore, Ive actually tried to google what the buttons do, and have come up short on info (which seems very odd). Unless you know what IT...COST...SELL...MAR...MU...MD...plus the other goofy buttons mean...I wish you the best of luck!"
4,Printing Calculator,Does the job it was ordered for works like a old style adding machine yet is a calculator and the most important thing it prints in two colors for positive and negative . I needed a unit that would proiduce a tape record and was reasonable this worked just fine .
5,yup.,"It's a calculator with a printer. It's easy to use. Most of us have seen them before. this one does math, which I like. It has a printer on it so I can check its work, but if I wanted to do that, I wouldn't be using a calculator. It comes with instructions, but let's be honest. If you don't know what a specific symbol stands for, You won't be using that function. You're more of a add/subtract user. I am too, it's cool. It comes with a power cord so you can plug it in, and has a ""aa"" battery port so you can take it camping. it is not water proof, so when you do take it camping, be careful, and make extra sure not to use it while canoeing. the buttons go all the way down, and come all the way up (unless you spilled soda all over it.) the screen displays Arabic numerals, sorry Romans.It's a calculator with a printer. it's pretty good."
2,Business Calculator not,"This machine was out of ink in two days during income tax time. When I need a tape I'm still using my cumbersome calculator. It may be old, but it is inexpensive to use."
5,Takes up less room than standard calculator...,"I still like to use the calculator and tape. This is perfect. Much smaller than the standard business calculator, so it doesn't monopolize your desk space."
1,casio HR-100TM calculator,"The instructions for this product are totally inadequate. I contacted Casio via their website to request a manual. However, they were not interested in responding. I also checked numerous websites to see if I could purchase a manual. It just doesn't seem to be available. It looks like a great calculator. But the enclosed fold out instruction sheet doesn't even cover some of the basic functions. I will no longer purchase any Casio products. Unless you have the assurance that a ""manual"" is included with your purchase, I do not recommend buying this product. I will be returning it to Amazon and purchasing a calculator from another company."
3,No Clue,"The Casio 100-TM is a suitable printing calculator, but the instruction manual is vague, confusing, and does not approach providing instuctions for full use of the calculator. It left me ""clueless"" as to the multiple functions and how to use them. I am afraid that the Instruction Manual suggests, ""Here, figure it out !""Casio HR-100TM 2-Color Printing Calculator"
4,great deal on hard to find item,"I was looking to replace a very old ten-key adding machine with a calculator with enough digits to display the large numbers I work with. I could find 8 or 9 digits, but I needed something much larger. I found this Casio Printing Calculator with 12-digit display at a very reasonable price. Thank you."
4,Great for the price,"Arrived quickly, everything fine, what I expected and good price. Only problem bought for my 88 year old mother and she had a difficult time trying to figuire out how its works. Just wanted a calculator that prints."
4,"OK, small font, light print","This unit needs an ink roller in order to print. Unknown how long they last. 6 paks for seven bucks or less can be had on ebay. Uses standard print paper rolls but font is small (8) and light. OK, it's cheap and does its job."
5,Just what I needed.,"I definitely needed an adding machine with paper. This is a perfect size for my desk and oh so much appreciated. I had a little calculator with tiny little buttons and if I miss when running a line of numbers, well I had no choice but to start over. Now, I can see what the error is and correct without starting over. I was so happy to find and purchase this."
5,Good calculator,"Very nice. It has all the functions I wanted and a few extra ones that I didn't know I wanted, but do use and like."
1,Cascio HR-100TM calculator,It had all the features I was looking for in a calculator BUT the paper roll was impossible to use. It appeared that the slot where the paper should enter was blocked!
4,good buy,the calculator works well for my personal needs. it is dual power. it would also work well for a small business or charity. I would recommend it
3,"Bill Nelson - Living In My Limousine (remix) 12"" single",Tracks are:- Living In My Limousine (remix)- White Sounds- Birds Of Tin- Love In The Abstract
3,Product review,"Item arrived , new and sealed. Thank you. My understanding was the listed product was a CD and not a DVD. Item worked perfectly."
4,Pleasantly Surprised,"I would rather Blu-Ray or DVD for music compilations instead of CD full of songs already in my library.I wasn't sure how he was going to pull off a Live Concert to record. The quality and sound is better than I expected.It isn't over done and he didn't try to create a stage full of dancers and elaborate sets. HE SINGS, SINGS and MORE SINGING.I would have paid for a seat at this concert."
3,Neither really happy or really sad .... it's okay,The picture was not as crisp as I would have liked but as background music and images it's okay. I wonder if we are all spoilt by Blu-Ray and 3D.
3,George Michael with distracting laser light show,I wanted to experience mainly the man and his music but for some reason there are constant and distracting laser lighting effects which detract. Too bad. The audience liked it though
1,Moviemars DO NOT BUY FROM THEM - BOOTLEG COPIES,"I was hoping to get the original DVD, but unfortunate the Seller is a crook. Sold me a Bad Bootleg Copy.Beware of this Seller "" MOVIEMARS"". They would take forever to send the stuff plus they would send Bad Bootleg Copies.They would never contact you back to solve the problem. I got 2 Dvds, with the same problem. DO NOT BUY FROM THEM ANYTHING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,ANOTHER TOTALLY MUST HAVE!!,I OWN MORE THAN 50 BLU-RAY CONCERTS....AND THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVORITES BECAUSE OF THE PERFECT SOUND AND PICTURE QUALITY.
3,Mediocre at best,"First of all, I like baby Einstein...but, this video was not up to par with other releases I have purchased. It was kind of boring and not as cute as world music or Beethoven."
5,neptunes ocean is different than baby neptune,"We own the 26 disc collection of Baby Einstein!! Having watched them many of times for the past year with my daughter Emily, we were searching for new ones!!I came across these discovery kits (9 total), and ofcoarse wanted them all at 1st!!We now own 4: Neptunes Ocean, Animals around me, Wild animal safari, and World of rhythm..Neptunes ocean is different mostly, world of rhythm is totally different from original 26 dvds... however, animals around me, wild animal safari are mostly clips from originals.Haven't bought the others either because they have already been published..Hope the baby einstein moms find this helpful if you are looking for new einsteins!!!!"
3,Country Style Solid Oak Wood Buffet & Hutch w/Bebelled Glass and Light,"This piece of furniture is beautiful and very well made, except for the clips that hold the glass in the doors. All have snapped off and needed to be replaced.The furniture arrived in good condition but had a distinct smell of mildew, which took me weeks to get rid of."
1,Yuck! Too New Age touchy-feely.,"I got this book as a gift -- I surely wouldn't have spent any money on it. It encourages self-absorption, which is never a good thing, and focuses on silly New Age ""self-discovery"" techniques. I suppose there are always going to be people who eat up this sort of thing, but I for one don't have time for such nonsense. This would be a great gift for a pregnant friend who is into cats, crystals and aromatherapy, but no-nonsense types are not going to like it."
5,Learn the nurturing habit now,"If you're not in the habit of practicing self-care, it's a habit you want to acquire right now -- while you are pregnant -- and this book will teach you exactly how to do it. I read and re-read this book countless times during my pregnancy. I can't recommend this book highly enough. Five stars!"
3,"Looks like the real thing, but small parts can be dangerous and frustrating.","We bought this for our 3 year old son and he loves playing with it. However, the lid on the dump bin is forever coming off and he has a hard time getting it back on by himself which leads to lots of extra work for mom & dad. Also, the wheels are actual rubber rings and they can come off so this is not for any child who still puts anything in their mouth or has younger siblings."
1,Breaks inevitably,"My 2 yo son picked this truck at our local grocery store. The hopper broke off the back almost immediately. Figuring it was a lack of supervision (he is TWO) we bought a second one the next day. It broke almost immediately. Still one might chalk it up to my 2 yo but that I noticed everytime I passed this rack of toys at the grocery store, more and more of the garbage trucks were broken-- within a couple of weeks all the hoppers were broken off the backs of all the trucks... still IN the store."
2,Broken easily,"My son brought this toy to a party to share with his friends right after it arrived because garbage trucks were his dream truck. He took it out of his backpack, handed it to one of his friends but the little boy didn't catch it. The truck felt and the back cover of the carriage felt apart. I could not put the back cover attached to the truck again because the shaft of the back cover was broken. The quality was very poor."
4,Study for the SATs with this,"Vocabulary Energizers is definitely a book with a younger crowd in mind - most likely to study for the SAT. I knew about 90% of the words already, but this is mitigated by the entertaining etymologies (histories of words.) Most of them come from Greek mythology, or have historical notes attached. There were also helpful synonyms and antonyms for each word.The book was a little lackluster, but served its' purpose. I will most likely go on read volume 2."
4,Daisy 617X,"I had problems with the original unit. Breech blew open when firing pellets. Finally breech jammed and would not open at all. I suspect the magnet either in the clip or the pistol as weak, allowing the rotary clip to dislodge and jam the breech.Returned to Daisy under warranty. Received NEW 617x in the plastic packaging. Works FLAWLESSLY. At 20-25 feet will penetrate a STEEL food can with a BB. Fires well over 40 shots with one CO2 tube.Nice hefty frame. I enjoy it."
2,Almost Crap,"the rotary bb/pelet holder is hard to fill especially with bb's and when you have more than one holder, the bb's tend to fall out or are pulled out by the magnet in the other holders close to it.i didn't see any instructions on how to OPEN the breach to load the rounds and in the process of learning, well, f*ed it up. now, if i don't hold the barrel with a finger or thumb when i'm shooting, it pops open and no round is fired.a somewhat related issue is the firing mechanism used to work but now the trigger will not fire on every pull. sometimes you have to pull the trigger 2 or 3 times to get it to fire then you hope it actually worked. (the above issue)i'm VERY dissappointed even though it may be some of my fault, it would have helped if the instructions had been clearer."
2,DVD inadequate,There are no bonus features on this DVD. You can watch it on netflix streaming. National Geographic is working to make DVDs obsolete. The actual doc is fascinating though and the campanion book is definitely worth it! A great gift for anyone who is into photography and/or presidential operations.
1,NOT THE MOST BENEFICIAL BOOK THAT I HAVE EVER READ.,"WELL, TO BE HONEST... I AM A PARAMEDIC WHO WORKS IN THE LA AREA, AND THE NUMBER OF PARAMEDIC BOOKS THAT I HAVE READ IS ALMOST INCOMPREHENDABLE. AFTER HAVING THE CHANCE TO READ THIS PARTICULAR ONE, I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH THE QUALITY AND LACK OF KNOWLEDGE IT POSSESSED. WHAT I WOULD RECOMMEND IS THAT IF YOU ARE REVIEWING FOR THE PARAMEDICS FINAL EXAMINATION, YOU NEED TO GO INTO THIS TEST COLD WITHOUT A REVIEW. WHAT I HAVE FOUND IS THAT REVIEWING FOR THESE TESTS ONLY CONFUSSES INDIVIDUALS LIKE YOURSELF EVEN MORE THAN WHAT YOU ALREADY ARE, THUS COMPLICATING COMMON SENSE MATERIAL BY ALMOST TEN TIMES. THIS IS UNNECESSARY, AND IT IS UNNECESSARY FOR YOU TO HAVE YOUR MIND INFLUENCED BY SUCH REDICULOUS MATERIAL."
5,Warriors Of Caladera,I've read Warriors of Caladera and find it very exciting and full of adventure. I highly recommend it.
4,Delightful Chapter Book to read to kids at bedtime,"This ia good book to read to the grandchildren when they sleep over. The storyline is delightful - with all types of fantasy characters and humorous adventures, and the chapters are just the right length for a chapter an evening.We really enjoyed Marigold, the tiny fairy, and Queen Celestine who rules over the Fairy kingdom. Light hearted and adventurous. The kids really enjoyed it."
4,Dog Eat Dog,"Dog Eat Dog, By Chris Lynch is one of the best books I've read in a while. It is a non-fiction book. I hadn't read the first two books of the trilogy before reading this, and I am going to start reading the first book of the series. I would recommend this book to anyone.It is a very intriguing book even though it is not the joyful book I've read; it is that, that makes my book intriguing. This book is about a 15 year old kid, who is going through many struggles with his family, and is trying to overcome all the struggles in his life. He goes through problems with in an Irish part of Boston where life's rough. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone under the age of 12 years old due to some of the strong language and graphic details of the book.It is a very good book for anyone trying to overcome their own personal problems and it is good to see that you can escape from your old life and start over. I was overall very happy that I read this book and I think most people would enjoy it."
2,Disappointed,"I purchased this book on the basis of a reader's review and the fact that it has an introduction by Lucien Clergue whom I respect as a photographer of the nude female form. It turns out the introduction is a very brief paragraph at the beginning of the book. The photographs range from mediocre to downright bad, most of them having been made with one studio light or outdoors under natural lighting. The poses are unispired and uninteresting save for the fact that they are of (sometimes) beautiful nude women. The printing is very contrasty with most of the highlights blown out. Whether that is the fault of the photographer's printing skills or the printing of the book, I can't say. I was deeply disappointed in this book overall."
4,Good book for business travellers to France and Switzerland.,"A slim (less than 1/2"") paperback that contains useful phrases that represent a modern understanding of French. Well organized in sections that make it an easy reference book. This book is not for the beginner. One must already understand French pronounciation and have a baseline comprehension of nouns and verbs.The only thing that would make this book easier for a broader audience would be the addition of an audio cassette for proper pronounciation of the phrases."
4,Get your Freak On!,This swing is awesome for the men! It has a hydraulic type extension that allows you to swing it any way you want it. However it is a little uncomfortable for the ladies. If I could turn back time I would have purchased one with a full leather backing. The two straps that hold you in the swing kind of dig in your skin. Its not unbearable but a little uncomfortable. However for the price on Amazon less than $100 I can deal with less comfort in comparison to others at $200-$300. This swing gets my husband extrememly excited so I would say overall its a great deal!
2,Broken,These headphone were great! But two weeks after I bought them the left headphone stopped working. I don't know if its just me but I'm pissed that my amazing headphones broke!
3,A decent NYC book,"If you are a budding fan of New York railroads, this book is a good place to start. It is an easy read with dozens of nice photos.If you own several other New York Central books, however, you may not find much new here. It could have been written by referencing just two prior books about the railroad, plus a bit of updating from the internet. There are also some pesky grammatical and spelling errors that detract from an otherwise pleasing book.Recommended for teens and young adults who are just becoming interested in railroad history. ""Old timers"" and rail experts can probably bypass this one."
4,Good Information,These books are a good reference for the average railroad buff. Not too in depth but gives you a good insight and some very good photographs...
4,New York Central Railroad,"The illustrations of this edition, MBI Publishing, 1999, paperback, are crisp. The book provides information about complex merger history and outline of nineteenth and twentieth century history of company as well as description of routes and motive power and interesting chapter on GCT.The book provides basic general information of a wide encompassing primer on the topic of this railroad. It does not go into details of track configurations of terminals, yards or stations,nor on the form of any of the many smaller stations and terminals themselves within the system, nor on the detail make-up of consists. But, it is a useful and concise overview of New York Central and its achievements."
2,Disappointing Text But Good Pictures,"Don't publishers employ editors or proof readers any more? This book is full of simple spelling errors and poor grammar, the kinds of errors that a proof reader would find very quickly. Many of the errors are missing or duplicated articles. Others are cases of a plural noun being used with a singular verb or vice versa. Another class of error, common to many books that include photographs, is captions that don't match the photograph in some important detail.Still, the many photographs in the book are of very good to excellent quality. Most of them are pictures that I have not seen in any other publications. It's unfortunate that the quality of the text and some erroneous captions make the whole thing suspect."
2,"good sound, does not last long","It is my second attempt to buy an HK DVD player. I mostly care for music, and each had great sound quality. However, they do not last long. After a year or two the DVD playback starts skipping, pixelating and simply getting stuck. Frequent lens cleaning helps for a while, but then one day it is unable to read the cleaning CDs anymore.Opening it and cleaning the lens carefully with alcohol sometimes helps to prolong its life a little. It happened to my first player (I think it was DVD26), and now exactly the same story with this one. I am now looking for a different brand for DVD player (but the HK receiver is excellent)."
2,Missing Remote,"The picture quality is good, and best of all, the DVD 38 plays somewhat scratched DVDs without lengthy pauses or freezes.The bad news is that the box did not contain a remote control. Instead was a note saying that the remote was packed inside the AVR box. I bought only the DVD player, so this was not helpful. When I contacted Harmon Audio, they agreed to send me a remote for free. 23 days later, I'm still waiting."
2,too small,"When I received this product, it was not as I had anticipated. All the charms that I had seen in the store were much larger. I am afraid that it will look funny on my daughters bracelet because of its size. I did not know they made charms so small."
3,Interesting concept,"This book is written in a manner that obviously marks it the starting point in a series. It's a little too drawn out to stand completely on its own.The five psychic teens who headline this book are an interesting and so far likable bunch. Everyone has their pasts and secrets as well as their own unique abilities. Together, linked in their psychic web, they learn the marvelous opportunity for training and education at the Zete Institute is just a ruse for its power-hungry founder.Good starting point. I'm looking forward to the next entry in the series."
1,Blah,"This story of a girl named Kaitlyn Fairchild who escapes from some gov't program is contrived. A comic book series called Gen-13 about a girl named Caitlin Fairchild who escapes from a gov't program was released almost a year before Dark Visions came out and it was much better, without the heavy-handed and absurd eroticism and one-dimensional characters. But then this is L.J. Smith I'm talking about"
5,Good trilogy!,I thought this was a good series. L.J. Smith does it again! Read all of them! You will be enthralled with this romantic haunting trilogy. I know I did
1,filled with errors,"This book is filled with errors. The very first week I had it in class, I noticed several just in the genetics chapter alone! I was hoping to have an OB book to keep as a reference when I'm done with nursing school, but I don't feel that I'd be able to trust this book. If I found many errors in an area that I'm familiar with, how many errors are there that I'm unable to discern since I'm not yet familiar with that material? Many of my classmates found additional errors, and also feel that the book is untrustworthy. It's too bad, because I'm sure that the book does contain worthwhile information. I'm sorry that I wasted the money on this book. I plan to invest my money in a medical OB book instead."
1,Horrible,"Having had to read this cover to cover, and then pass the NCLEX, I can only say....don't use this as a reference. Please, if this book is assigned to you, get another maternity review book to study for the boards! This book was full of errors, and impossible to navigate!"
3,Haynes 240Z manual,"Haynes does a pretty good job, but they don't usually have all the information contained in the automakers's shop manuals. You don't always get as much diagnostic information. Overall I would say they are average, but sufficient for most repairs. They need more photographs as well."
3,Its a decent guide,"There is very little information on the 1978's, granted theres not that much of a difference from the 260z, but the wiring diagrahm is slightly different.Worth the money but your still going to have to search online every so often"
3,READ BEFORE PURCHASING,"If you haven't already got the hint well that's too bad for you. This guide is filled with lots of useful information for the Datsun 240z - 280z. However there is little info on the later 280z with fuel injection. If you're car has a carburetor, then this is the book for you. If not well, you're probably better off buying the fuel injection manual as well. There are a few pages in the back of the book that discuss changes for the 280z, but nothing compared to the rest of the book."
1,It NEVER came,"The seller(Iron Horse Helemts) managed to send the wrong helmet,the wrong size, the worng color, the wrong brand. This seller was terrible to deal with, I traded the helmet he sent me at a local place, and had to take a loss. I don't know if the helmet is any good or not. I DO know the helmet I ended up with is great! Do your business in person, it's much more satisfying!"
5,Great,"despite the pic of bag of infinite ping pong balls, I received mine in a nice box with around 10 balls per plastic pack. I threw them all over the floor, cat is seizuring with joy. None were broken or smashed on arrival. the dog chews on everything but was unable to break or dent any of them"
2,Balls arrived covered in purple mystery goo,"I ordered these for a craft project luckily, or I would have returned them. About a dozen of them had some purple mystery goo on them. I can imagine that they were used for beer pong or who knows what previously and were not cleaned before selling. The box they arrived in was totally crushed and wrapped in shrink wrap, I assume by USPS, to keep it all together (none of the balls were crushed). I understand shipping damage happens, but the box looked pretty flimsy to start with. Maybe that was the source of the purple goo? Who knows, but I'm not totally pleased."
1,Not Really ping pong balls,"Well - just goes to show that you get what you pay for. These are THICK plastic balls, the size of ping pong balls, but MANY have seam/ridge all the way around and they are really NOT for ping pong.Perhaps I can make a craft with them."
3,Good for Minute to Win It games,Purchased to play Minute to Win it Games. If you plan on playing with kids I would recommend more ping pongs.
2,"Crap for ping pong balls, great for projects!","These are terrible ping pong balls, but if you make them into a garland (for a project) then they work great! they also retain spraypaint decently and also can be easily punctured with a hand stitching needle. It's mondo handy!"
1,smaller size than regular ping pong ball,"these balls are smaller than the regular ping pong ball. If you purchase them with ipong automatic ball throwing machine, it would not work. Because the ball does not fit well into the pit of the machine."
2,"Odd plastic, not what I'm used to, but good enough for beer pong.","The plastic is odd, not at all like a normal ping pong ball. Every light a ping pong ball on fire? They flash away like a magic trick. Not so these balls, they just ignore the flame or melt a bit... It affects their bounce. But for games of beer pong, they are good enough."
2,not what I thought it was,"I ordered these thinking I was getting a lot of ping pong balls for my 3 sons, who play daily, it turns out they are beer pong balls and not good for ping pong at all"
1,Never Received,"Well, I ordered these ping pong balls on 4/5/10 and as of today, 5/7/10, I have never received them. They debited my account within a day of coarse and said I'd have them 7-10 days later. When it had been 15 days, I emailed them (twice) finally got back to me, apologized and said they'd send out another box. Well, as I said it's now 5/7 and still no ping pongs. I've emailed them again 2 days ago and still waiting for a response."
1,Poor Quality,Balls are smaller compared to other ping pong balls. Also ball does not bounce properly. I am not satisfied with the quality of these balls
1,Will not work in Joola Ping Pong Robot,"They are not 40mm. They are smaller and not a hard plastic ping pong ball. Not recommended for ping pong, for beer pong - they are ok."
2,Not Practice Ping Pong Balls :-(,"I purchased these for some folks that play ping pong all the time, (just for fun), but are constantly losing or breaking the ping pong balls. I was very excited, as I got these for a great price and with 144 ping pong balls, it would take them awhile to go through them all. Unfortunately, these arrived labeled as beer pong balls, are smaller than a standard ping pong ball and can't be used for true practice because they do not move or function like a normal ping pong balls. My friends were very kind about it and did try to use them, but they just don't work right. Would be great for beer pong or other carnival types of games, however. I only paid 12 bucks, so it is not a huge loss, but it was a bit of a let down."
1,Misleading Product Description--not even good for beer pong!,"I should have paid attention to previous reviews. You can call it fraud to list this product as Ping-pong balls. The balls are constructed from poor materials, resulting a low and random bounce. These are definitely not good as ping-pong balls, not matter what level of play. They are not even good as beer pong balls!"
3,Ping Pong Balls are pretty dead,I thought all ping pong balls are the same. Apparently not as these balls have about half the bounce as the ones I purchase at Modell's in a 12 pack. Albeit the price was right and they can be used for beer pong -- but they are relatively dead on the table.
2,Better to spend extra bugs and get better balls,"I wish, i would have gone for the branded one, as returning this package along with deduction policy is total waste."
2,Cheaply made,"These ping pong balls seem like a great deal. However, if you're looking for ping pong balls that feel ""normal"", you will be greatly disappointed. These are very thin and light and generally poorly made to the point where they interfere with ping pong, beer pong, or whatever else you try to do with them."
2,Ping pong pow-wow,These were low quality ping pong balls - ok for the kids to goof around playing with - but they do not fly straight when hit...and they have a seam around the entire ball - so they arent even smooth flat balls.
3,My cats prefer the heftier orange ones,"These are okay and came promptly, but their bounce is a little flimsy and my cats prefer the heftier orange ones."
1,"There is no good, practical use for these","I bought these to use in my IPong table tennis robot. I did not realize they were 38mm, the OLD standard (which do not work in modern table tennis robots). The new standard is 40mm.These balls are made of a very cheap plastic and just feel awful. Their ridges stand out, they don't bounce evenly, they don't impact properly, they sound awful, and they're ugly. 4/5 senses offended right there. If I didn't have a cold, I would speak to their smell!"
1,DO NOT BUY THIS,I should have listened to people with poor reviews. I learned my lesson please do not purchase this item. It is very poor quality and you will be disappointed.Amazon should listen to reviewers and take this out of their approved vendor list.
2,Bad Quality Balls,The balls are not good quality at all. They do not bounce properly for ping pong. Maybe they can be used in a youth club or YMCA but not table tennis competitions.
1,It was my worst experience in Amazon,It is not ping pang ball at all. It is made of soft plastics and can not be played at all.
3,Cheap,"If you ok with cheap syuff, pick this up. I wouldn't be to happy if this was all I had to play with. Spend more and get more."
1,practice balls NOT GOOD FOR MACHINES,I bought these balls for the ipong machine. They are 100% worthless. they are too small and just fall out of the machine. They are not round --they are crooked balls and dont roll straight.
1,CRAP.,These might be useful in crafts or just to throw as people you dont like. They are irregular and should NOT be listed as PING PONG balls!!
2,Not useful.,"Unless you're going to use these for something other than table tennis, stay away. These are cheap mass produced balls... But they don't behave at all like a table tennis ball, not even good enough for practice. To be fair, it says practice and they're cheap, I should have known better."
1,These are not ping pong balls,"Great lesson learned, read all Amazon reviews before buying. I bought these using a mobile device without properly vetting the product. These are not ping pong balls. They are some cheap plastic spheres manufactured to look like ping pong balls. You can not actually use them for anything. They have a wiffle ball action in mid air. Perhaps they are useful as a fun zone mock up for your hamster."
1,Not Ping Pong Ball at All. Beer Bong Maybe.,"I bought a bag of them while I bought a ipong serving robot, as suggested by Amazon. Not working at all. The balls are too soft. The robot cannot even throw any of them more than a feet. I need to put the robot on the same side of the table! Not sure if they can still be called ping pong ball. Maybe they are good enough for beer pong."
1,These can not be used for Ping Pong.,These are not ping pong balls. These balls are suited for Crafts only. The seem is not aligned properly.What are these balls made of?
3,Good enough for Sous Vide,"I bought these to cover the water bath for sous vide immersion cooking. The balls float on the top and help keep the water from evaporating over longer cooking times. They work just fine for that purpose. I can tell they are lower quality and wouldn't be great for actual table tennis for those serious about the game. However, good price for my use."
1,Don't waste your time and money,"I bought a pk of 144 balls because of the low price and a few positive comments. It was super fast delivery. Unfortunately, I had to return these balls because of the poor quality. These balls are too light in weight, small in size with deep seams. They bounce irregularly. They are only good for kid's artwork, not really fit for table tennis practice or training."
1,Horrible,"These ping pong balls were a waste of money. None of them bounce correctly. They either bounce off to the side or the only bounce a couple of inches. They are also really soft, and make a terrible sound when you play with them. The seam is evident on all of them."
4,These items are NOT good for ping pong...,... but they're just fine for crafts. What did you expect for the price?They were exactly what I was looking for for my project.
1,The worst purchase on amazon so far,I purchased these ping-pong balls thinking these where at least 1 star balls. I would rate these balls at -1000 and that's being kind. If I were to look up cheap in the dictionary I would expect to find a picture of these balls in it. I have made many purchases on Amazon and I never have been displeased until now. My recommendation is not to purchase this item. You could not sustain a game of ping-pong with these balls due to the lack of bounce I highly suspect if you could play beer pong for the same reason.
1,These are NOT ping pong balls,"They are nothing like ping pong balls. They are the wrong size, the wrong bounciness, the wrong material, the wrong weight, they arent even perfectly round so they fly through the air strangely!Absolutely useless as ping pong balls. Cant even play beer pong with them."
1,Terrible,Not what I expected will give them to grandkids but will probably not buy from this site again. They should not be advertise as Ping Pong Ball. Maybe craft balls for school projects. Brian
1,Do not use with Ipong,these balls are so low quality that they do not have the bounce that is required to use with an Ipong machine. do not be fooled by these balls. The balls have a terrible seam all around the ball and are not useful as game or practice balls. i worry that the seller is still selling this product.
5,nice and cheap,I bought these to number and use for drawings at work. Fit the bill perfectly. Don't think I'd use'em for ping pong but for what I needed them for they are fine.
4,Ping Pong Balls,The need was to use in drawings. They arrived in a timely manner and worked very well for our use.
1,Poor Quality,"These ping pong balls were some of the worst quality that I've seen. Some of them were lop-sided and none of them bounced consistently. They break easily and aren't evenly balanced. What I mean is that if you hit them on the seem (which is quite visible) they make a deeper sound and bounce directly off like a ping pong ball should. If you hit the ball anywhere else, the ball gives in and molds to the surface of the pattle and doesn't bounce at all. I'm thankful that the pattles that i ordered came with decent balls otherwise I would have to buy more balls, from a different source. I know the 144 balls for $15 is enticing but you don't even get what you pay for."
3,Cheap ping-pong balls,"Ping-pong balls are not the same size as standard balls and are not totally spherical. I guess for the price, I shouldn't have expected perfect balls, but I wish I had been informed."
3,Nasty Looking and Not for Ping Pong,"It should be clear from the reviews that these are not for table tennis (unless you are maybe a six year old beginner). Quality is poor. Further, the ""made in China"" stamp on each (20% smeared) makes them pretty nasty looking. OK for Beer Pong (maybe the seam adds to the excitement of the game) and for crafts, if you are going to paint them solidly. For us, it was ideal: we needed them for a kids game involving throwing balls at each other. These are small and light and can do no damage. And the price was certainly right!"
5,more balls than you can shake a stick at,"How can 144 ping pong balls be anything but overwhelmingly positive? Sure, a few came out of the box cracked, but great bang for the buck here. Lots of pong gets played in the office (sadly, more ""ping"" than ""beer"") and we have some really good players, but there have been no complaints about the balls."
1,POS,These suck. my mom got me them 4 my b-day they r not real ping pong balls. they suck for smoke bombs unlike real pingpong balls!!!!!!!! waste of my moms money
1,bad for pong,"The balls are very light. They're made of a thin plastic (not like a traditional ping pong ball) and they have a pronounced seam through the center of the ball that goes all the way around, bad for bouncing."
1,Doesn't fit burp gun,"These ate very cheap pong balls. Although Amazon features them with the burp gun, they are too big to fit that toy. They have a full diameter seam. Might be good for crafts or desperate beer pong players"
1,Not like the image,"I bought these balls for an art project. The picture shows completly white balls, but actually, there are black writtings all over it. I had to scratch them all, and it took me many hours."
3,Potentially ok depending on your application,"These serve great purpose as beer pong or any other type of play balls. However, they should not be marketed as ping pong balls.They have a very visible seam, and are sometimes out of round. This of course leads to strange bounces and can become rather infuriating for someone that is trying to learn/or play even semi competitively."
1,smaller than normal ping pong balls,I purchased to go with the ipong practice machine and the balls were too small. The wheel that kicks the ball out had a gap so no contact was made with the ball to shoot them out. I thought ping pong balls were all the same size. Good for carnival game but I don't recommended to play ping pong.
3,PLASTIC,"I purchased these to go with the iPong Table Tennis Training Robot, but they did not work even though they were suggested to buy together. They were plastic and too small for the robot. Disappointed that I wasted my money and especially to realize this on Christmas morning. :("
3,"Depends what you're using them for, they work for me!","Not Ping pong balls, softer shiny plastic with a noticeable seam. Saying that I bought them for a school party for minute-to-win-it type games and they'll work just fine. They do bounce on the floor about the same as some 1* ping pong balls I bought. Cheap and cheerful, just what I needed!"
1,"Fraud, bait and switch","Web site showed ping pong balls - Two seperate lables on the bag contradicte eachother. One says ""Beer Pong Balls"" & the other says ""Ping Pong Balls"". These are not ping pong balls but plastic toy balls with no bounce. They are also smaller in size than a standard ping pong ball. Why all of the work to mis-represent a $9.00 product?"
2,pong balls,these were not the same type of balls I have ordered in the past. these were 38mm not 40 mm and glossy. i use them in a craft project and they were difficult to use.
1,Terrible!!! DO NOT BUY!,I would have put 0 star if I could. This product is TERRIBLE. They are not even ping pong balls!!! They are so light that you can not hit them. Do Not Buy!!!
5,how can I get it on DVD?,This was one of my childhood favorites and I would love for my daughter to see it too. I am hoping someone who has a good quality copy can put it up for sale on DVD here! =)
3,Not what I expected,"I first heard Josh Rousse on a Various Artists album, and this was the first Josh Rousse album I've purchased. I was dissipointed to find out that it wasn't much like the song of his that I heard (Laughter). The album itself is not bad, it has a easy-going, laid back feel, similar artists would be Jack Johnson and Duncan Sheik. The tracks mold together, giving it a somwhat bland feel to it, but overall worth the money."
3,Magical,"I do really like this album, it has a breezier feel to it,more studio, i also have heard 1972,and Home, which i loved, Under cold blue stars has some really magical tracks , 'ears to the ground' and' under cold blue stars' are my favorite on this one, i find it hard to categorize mr. rouse, and thats what makes him so appealing,he seems to be able to competely change his voice and feel, but the effect is still stellar."
5,Big Picture Partnering:16 Weeks to a Rock-Solid Relationship,"What's great about this book is that it's not a solve-the-problems-in-your-relationship kind of book. It seems to be for couples who are doing just fine, they just want to kick it up a notch: reconnect, re-evaluate, and look at where they want to go together. This was an invaluable read for us (we both read it)- and we find ourselves really enjoying exploring places outside of our daily lives- the plans and goals we talked about when we first got together."
2,I was not impressed,"For me, the ""recipe"" style one size fits all approach felt too simplistic to be of value to me. I prefer material that promotes deeper thinking about relationships.BEWARE of her new book titled ""Romance Rehab"" copyright 2010 that is almost word for word the SAME AS THIS ONE. Shame on you Jan and your publishers for misleading readers into thinking this is new material."
5,An Outstanding Book for ALL Grievers,"As a Pastoral Bereavement Educator and Companion, I had stopped recommending books because there are so many good ones being offered.With Elaine Stillwell's book, I have changed my thoughts and will now recommend ""The Death of a Child"" to anyone suffering a loss of any kind.A truly outstanding aid for grievers and their caregivers!"
4,Practical Tools for Grieving Parents,"Elaine Stillwell, mother of two young adults killed in a car accident 15 years, ago has spent many years since as the Bereavement Coordinator of the Diocese of Rockville Center, N.Y. In Death of a Child she offers support and advice to parents dealing with the whole spectrum of loss: children who die suddenly, after extended illness, before or soon after birth, and even death that involves war on terrorism. Topics include anger with God, communicating with a spouse, voicing emotions, and coping with holidays and anniversaries. Stillwell does a good job addressing specific issues for each of these losses."
5,Lock up your garden implements,"If you plan to watch this film and you are NOT alone my first suggestion, and it is a very strong one is to go out to your garden, pick up all your implements and put them in their shed, and lock the shed door. This stunner is just that ... one hell of an amazing film on the limits to which human sanity can be pushed, and what happens when that point is reached and overstepped. As the jacket to this superbly rendered blu-ray says ""a must-see for anyone brave enough"". I have watched it in one sitting, I am still thinking about it, and wondering how I share this film with her. That I am still debating. But on second thought I just will turn in now and not worry about how I am doing until after she sees it with me, and then I will check that lock."
1,Poor reproduction.,"This set was very poor in every aspect. Do not waste your time and money to buy this. As most of the buyers out there have HD television sets, this DVD set does not look good on it, the image is very distorted. On older TVs, yes, maybe it will look normal. I am sorry I wasted my money on this."
2,"decent to own for completists, but the transfer is AWFUL.","i picked this up because i'm an airwolf fan and a completest. plus, there is fantastic mock-kitsch value in re-watching a show you adored as a kid. what was i thinking? it's TERRIBLE. but i still loved it, so it's fun to watch again.however, the transfer is the WORST i've EVER seen. sure, the show was shot on video tape and not film, but so was ST:TNG and it looks like a pristine HD transfer compared to this mess. the noise, the grain, you almost have to just listen to the show on your computer and not watch it. it's the nosiest thing i've ever seen. my old VHS tapes i made when it was on USA in 1987 look BETTER than this DVD. how is that POSSIBLE?UNIVERSAL, if you're going to invest the money to find the tapes, make the transfers, and license the content, at least put the TINIEST EFFORT into cleaning up the print!!!but, if you're a fan like me, you'll probably want it on your shelf with the other three seasons anyway...and they know that."
5,Very nice to see Airwolf Season 4 on DVD finally,"As the greatest Airwolf fan in Korea, I'm very glad to see Airwolf Season 4 on DVD. In fact, I have already bought it on DVD which has been released in France (French version) lately in advance. Anyway, this edition finally concludes the entire series of Airwolf on DVD.Whatever they say, I believe Airwolf had been, was, is, and will be one of the greatest TV shows around the world forever. I hope more and more people will get interested in Airwolf Season 4 which has been underestimated. Airwolf Season 4 deserves to be Airwolf itself. There's no reason it has to be undervalued.Looking forward to it. Thanks."
1,Not Worth it!!!!!,This Season 4 is total disgrace to Airwolf! The actors are awful and give very poor performances (except Barry Van Dyke). Geraint Wyn Davies and Anthony Sherwood totally do not deserved to be on this show!No other words necessary! DON'T BUY SEASON 4!
3,what happened to hawk,I SAW THE FRIST SHOW OF THE 4TH SEASON AND I HAVE A QUESTION TO ANYONE THAT CAN HELP ME THE QUESTION IS WHAT HAPPENED TO HAWK IT SHOED HIM IN THE HOSPITAL AND ST JOHN CAME IN AND THEY HUGGED EACH OTHER THEN HAWK SAID I DON'T WANT TO DIE AND ST JOHN SAID YOU WON'T THEM HAWK SAID I DON'T WANT TO DIE IN HERE AND ST JOHN SAID YOU WON'T THEN THE NEXT THING HAWK IS NOT IN THE ROOM SO I DON'T GET IT DID HAWK DIW OR DID ST JOHN TAKE HIM SOME WHERE TO GO BETTER HELP OR TAKE HIM TO THE CABIN THATS WHAT I AM TRYING TO FIGURE OUT IT WAS GOOD SHOW SAD TO SEE DOM DIE THOUGH THANK YOU
2,Airwolf Season 4,"I would only recommend this video if you are a diehard fan like me of the 1984 series by the same name. This season is a new show with Airwolf as the main character. The acting is cheesy, the special effects are redressed (not even that really) effects from the first three seasons and none of the original actors or producers of the original returned. They literally have no new flying sequences. In fact the original Airwolf helicopter was sold off or destroyed. There was only a mock up produced for close up shots and even that isn't very good to the keen eye!I'm surprised this show was even authorized. I only recommend it if you are a diehard fan and like Barry Van Dyke and Geraint Win Davies and if you just want the ""complete"" series!"
4,READ ONE CHAPTER & YOU'VE READ THE BOOK,"This book deals with an important subject. The author introduces the problem andthen goes for several chapters building on the idea as to why different people havetrouble seeing eye to eye on the ""ONE"" Bible. The shortcoming of the book is thatthe author seemed to write more on the scholarly level than for the ""people in thepew"", so I had a harder time following his thoughts than I expected. (The authorwas a scholar, people in psychology may recognize the term ""Stroop Effect"").Basically I believe that if one reads the opening chapters & the chapter ""GOD'SWISDOM vs MAN'S WISDOM"", he/she will get the gist of the book.I did like the book, but since we ARE talking about matters of eternity, I wouldhave preferred that the author had condensed the book more, or at least written ata lower ""grade level"" so it would have been easier for the average person tofollow. That said, this is a very worthwhile study."
2,It's very Large!,It's a nice pendant if it was white gold it would have been even better. Its not really something you want around your neck. It's very large. It was really cheap though.
2,big,"alot bigger than I thought, more something you would hang on rearview mirror than wear. Cheap almost plastic-looking"
4,beautifully crafted,"This is a well made, nice looking pendant. The finish is beautiful and it has some weight to it too. I scored it 4 rather than 5 only because I think it would be more attractive if it were a bit smaller. I should have paid more attention to the dimensions before buying as it is a bit large and I don't generally wear big jewelry."
1,Someone TOLD me this is not Scary!,"I must say I was warned,this video is not scary!!It more for small children,so be sure small children watch this because it BORING!!!!"
2,"Disappointing in scope, but interesting read.",As an experienced genealogist I was perhaps expecting a bit more on the serious side of research from this volume. It was an interesting read but left me wishing that it had been more inclusive and detailed.
1,Not very helpful,I did not find this book to be helpful. I thought it was unorganized and the lack of footnotes or other citations made it useless.
1,I don't remember ordering this!,"Okay, I'm trying to clear out my reviews and I don't remember ordering this...maybe I gave it as a gift. Sorry I cannot give a review on this item."
3,I've used better,"I bought these because I wanted to try my hand at baking cookies with my baby girl. The 2 largest were really not necessary - they were way too big. The main complaint I have is that they actually rusted the first time we used them! I was baking over a 2 day period, and would rinse them off immediately after finishing, but before I even had a chance to dry them individually, they rusted at all the seams. They are also pretty flimsy. easily bent. but they do make cute cookies as long as you are careful not to squeeze them too tight"
2,Cookie cutters were just ok,The cookie cutters were not very good. The small one worked ok but the other 3 did not when cookies were cut the looked kind of like gingerbreaden but once baked they looked like nothing at all. The cutters were miss shaped and too bendable.
5,Great!,These cookie cutters work great! We use them with other kids crafts too. They are a little sharp on the bottom.
5,Great Book,"This is a great book to get started with. It's a little old, so I'm sure there have been a lot of technical advances since it came out, but the principles are still the same. Everyone should read this to gain a better understanding of good animation principles. They will also gain a good basis for understanding facial animation setups. You can't lose."
2,gazing ball tacky,"I was disappointed in the gazing ball, as it does not look as nice as it did in the picture. It has a cheap tacky look to it, not at all what I had expected for the price that I paid. Perhaps if I hide it under some leaves and greenery, it might look better. If my husband had not been so efficent with getting rid of the packing materials, I would have returned it. It would have been nicer if you couldn't see through the glass, if it were colored glass or something, but to see the fiber optics so clearly detracts from what it could have been. The solar idea is great, and I look forward to more tastefully designed products in the future,however,I think I would want to see it in person before purchasing."
4,Garden Gazing Ball,"I really like the colors of the globe. I wish the base could be a little taller, but otherwise it is great. I have received several compliments. Thanks"
4,Now I can see the future!,This gazing ball is amazing. The first night I used it scared me. It looked like the lok nar from that heavy metal movie. I swear the more I stare at it I believe I can see the future which is me staring at it. After staring at it for 19 days straight It began to speak to me. The gazing ball told he it was the last of its kind that the source of its amazing glow was gas. Human gas. The gazing ball told me that in the future the fda wages war on one of mankinds most noble and inherinte rights. The right to fart. He told me that within its magical glass contains the last human fart and that it was mine. It said I was the chosen one and destined to save the world. I had no idea what to do. Then it came to me after eating alot of beans and several burritos. I cracked the glass breathed in the inspiration and bought the company. Long live Chameleon gazing balls. I personally inspect each and every one for freshness.
3,Of Limited Use,"This massive trade paperback (in excess of 980 pages) is printed in an eye-blastingly illegible font (somewhat like the old IBM Selectric letter gothic). I was mainly interested in its coverage of the classic SF TV shows of 1949-60, and it turns out there is info here not readily available elsewhere. Coverage ranges from 11 pages for SPACE PATROL to half a page for BUCK ROGERS. Info seems generally accurate, which cannot be said for most books on this topic! Recommended with reservations."
1,Ouch,"The title picture is cooler then the actual video, dont be fooled. Not much behind the scenes either..one of the least fav skate videos Ive seen."
2,ok,"ok video, no groundbreaking tricks and no real look into the local euro skate scene. should not have been a stand-alone release but rather a segment of a team video."
4,totally better,these episodes are alot better then the first season. i like the beginning better and this seems like a better story then the first or second counting the bad parts
4,Seoson 2 Hits,"O.k so you thot season 1 was junk.Now its season 2 Battle City Duels.Now its better because Yami Yugi searches for his past. This DVD contains 4 eposodes The Mystery Dulist P. 1 and 2, Fortelling the past and Stepping out.In the first 2 eposodes Bandit Kieth steals Yugis Puzzle and challenges Yugi to a duel. But who is really controlling Bandit Kieth? Then a woman named Isis invites Kaiba to a meeting where she tells him of 3 mighty cards and gives him one.In the 4rth eposode Tea trys to help Yami Yugi find his past but Johny Steps interrupts."
4,AWESOME! MUCH BETTER THAN SEASON 1 (2),"I know that myself and many people I know hated season 1 ( Or 2 if you count the ""Bad"" Episodes ) But this season is much better. First off, the new theme song is WAY better than season 1, and has some cool screenshots. The cutesyish drawings in the past season are gone, and now the animation looks more real and deep. The episodes are pretty cool, and introduce the new season nicely. The bonus features are a lot better than the past seasons features. And its now called ""Yu-Gi-Oh! Battle City Duels "" This also has 4 Episodes, which is better than 3. I gave it 4 stars because their is only the english version. I WANT THE JAPANESE ONE!"
5,Yu-Gi-Oh DVD VOL 01 Mystery Duelist Battle City Duels,"In this Yu-Gi-Oh DVD at most of the end of the show where Summoned Skulls arms being choped off in the Japanese Version it is better. Because their isn't that glowy thing, I mean what is that suppose to be? Green Blood? Any ways in every Japanes Yu-Gi-Oh DVD their is always vilonce in the episodes and secnes that where not suppose to be in the US episodes."
5,Wonderful!!,"If you love mysteries, murder and otherwise, these stories may be for you. Yes, many of the beliefs of Catholicism come into play in these stories, and those are often what trips up the thieves."
4,First album by Jovelina Perola Negra,"This is the first album by Brazilian samba singer Jovelina Perola Negra, originally released in 1985 on the RGE label. It includes songs by Nei Lopes, Arlindo Cruz, Monarco and others, as well as original tunes by Perola Negra herself. The songs are:1 O dia se zangou2 Pagode no Serrado3 Boogie-woogie da favela4 Preparado da vovó5 Menina voc bebeu...6 Água de poo7 Laos e pedaos8 Rabo de saia9 Maria Tristeza10 Camaro com xuxu11 Chora viola12 É isso que eu mereoFans of Clementina de Jesus may like this as well; Jovelina died in 1998. (DJ Joe Sixpack, Slipcue Guide To Brazilian Music)"
5,Heartbreaking...,"This is a story of how three FDNY firehouses dealt with the loss of their fellow firefighters who they ate with, lived with, fought fires with and laughed with... until 9/11.One only needs to look into the faces of these men to see that the expression ""boys"" become ""men"", is taken a step further when we witness ""men"" who have become ""MEN"". They are a part of our history and a national treasure. You hear from the firefighters them selves, in detail, their experiences on that day and the days, weeks and months following. An unscripted, historical record of great importance. I highly recommend it."
2,Some of the Worst FX Ever Filmed,"Poorly acted, a lot of dead screen time where the director seems to be just tickeing off the footage, this mid-70's turkey is watchable only for how bad it is. Alan ""Skipper"" Hale from Gilligans Island shows up as a local sherrif in a town plagued by an invasion of arachanoids. Funny as hell this film tried to pass off a fur covered VW Beetle (complete with arms!) as a spider. I know it was tough going before CGI, but if the cast and crew got through this without laughing hard at themselves, they truly have no humor in their DNA..."
2,Adds a new dimension to the term VW Bug!,One of the giant spiders in this ridiculous movie is built around a VW bug! Actually it doesn't look that much more ridiculous than any of the other creepy crawlies here. Bad movie fans will enjoy this and the disc looks pretty good. Director interview too.
1,for B-Movie afficiados only,"I saw GIANT SPIDER INVASION double billed with AT THE EARTH'S CORE when it was first released at a drive-in in 1975; I was 6 years old. I finally had the opportunity to see this again almost 3 decades later. Basically this film is a total failure, but don't let that deter you if you have a taste for 70's B-Movie fare. Highlights are Alan Hale(""Hi little buddy!!"")and in one seen where you can actually see the microphone moving from side to side at the bottom of the screen. Stupid, grimy; for the curious only."
1,Poorly written,"It is hard for me to believe that this book was proofread before it went to print. It has many typo and grammatical errors, as well as misspelled words. Because the presentation is so poor, it is very hard to follow the subject. Therefore, I cannot trust the technical information."
1,poor performance,Ordered 3 solar globe lights....the first one filled with water and sank in a week. The other 2 hardly give off any light. Cheap construction....we are trying to return them
1,useless china junk,"fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice shame on me. 1st one DOA. 2nd lasted 2 days."
3,Perhaps not as shown,"I had a previous globe that was broken during a hail storm. I searched for one like it, and all I could find were 6"" globes, when the broken one was 10"". I bought this one, because the picture was different from all the rest, and I thought it might be a 10"" globe. It was not. It was exactly like all the rest."
1,"Arrived in pieces, does not work","Please buy this elsewhere..This is a piece of cheap junk, and mine does not even work to make it worse."
3,Not a traditional scrap quilting book,"The author no doubt is a very talented quilter, and did a great job with the book. However, I was somewhat mislead by the title. I thought the book would deal exclusively with tradtional scrap quilts - you know, making do with scraps like they did during the depression and war years. This was not the case. I purchased the book from a book club, so I wasn't able to review it's contents before I bought it. Had I been able to do so, I would not have made the purchase."
4,Cheaper at Fred Meyer!,"I almost didn't try this because I bought the Walden Farms chocolate sauce and marshmallow sauce several years ago and they were awful. But thanks to Amazon reviews, I decided enough people liked the salad dressings that I should give them a chance.I found this at my local Fred Meyer (Kroger family) for a few pennies over $5. The FM stores in Boise have a little diet food section, and that's where I found it. I bought the Bacon Ranch, and I must say it's pretty good. I had a full bowl of salad with plenty of dressing (I like lots!) for just 20 calories. Very cool!I wonder how this would taste on shiritaki (yam) noodles? I think I'll try that tomorrow."
2,Doesn't Taste Good,"I had to throw this out because it really didn't taste good. It's hard to describe the taste, but it didn't taste like anything that I've had in Japanese restaurants."
1,Cal-free Thousand Island huge disappointment.,"I was looking for no-fat salad dressings and stumbled across Walden Farms Thousand Island dressing. Wow, what a huge disappointment. Doesn't smell good, doesn't taste good, nothing. I'm serious. This product doesn't come anywhere close to the real thing and I have tried several no-fat dressing that do. Sorry, this needs to come off the shelf."
3,Ranch Flavor Dresssing is OK...,"At first try, I was tempted to give it a slightly higher rating, but I guess it depends on you sensivity to some of the ""flavoring"" used. I actually had a fairly low expectation, so for me, this was a bit better than I expected. I used it to make a tuna salad, so some of the flavors are better suited to that perhaps. I am on a strict low carb diet so this seems to be good enough."
1,Terrible: Walden Farms Ranch Dressing,"This review is specifically on the Ranch dressing, it may not apply to other flavors. I have to admit that I bought this on a gluten free foods web site and completely missed the zero calorie description. I don't know what people who eat zero calorie dressing are used to, but I was expecting a tasty gluten free Ranch dressing that is at least recognizable as Ranch(or dressing for that matter). I can't believe there are reviewers saying this stuff has flavor. Well, it does but the flavor is something like what you might get if you took a dirty dish rag, dipped it in latex paint and wrung it out on your salad: This is vile and nasty stuff! Don't waste your money on this one."
2,Walden Farms Dressing,The product is designed to work with reduced calorie diets. Its not my favorite. It lacks substance and the flavor needs more spice.
2,Strictly for Those on a Diet,"I would certainly compliment Walden Farms for their line of zero-calorie salad dressings. It's really quite amazing how they can do this.The Thousand Island dressing is fair. The major flavor that comes across is vinegar. In small amounts, mixed into a salad, it does the trick. It gives a kick to ""boring"" field greens. In larger amounts, it's no better than tolerable, but you may feel good that you can have a huge greens salad and dressing for under 50 calories. One thing is clear: It does not taste much like full fat or low fat Thousand Island dressing."
4,Not bad,"This is not bad, it's good on a salad, and decent as a veggie dip as well. It's very tangy, and nice in it's own way but does not taste like a normal full fat ranch dressing. It's on par with other low fat or light dressings I have tried, but with 0 calories. I like to add a little cracked black pepper to mine. I may buy this again, but I prefer their Caesar dressing."
5,SATISFIED CUSTOMER,I ordered Walden Farms for a friend of mine that couldn't find it in the stores of the UK. SHe loves it. I purchased the Honey Dijon and am equally satisfied.
3,Taste is Great Price is a rip off,"Great tatse, but I can buy it for 1/2 this price in the store. hey Walden farms..not all diabetics are RICH. Shame on you !"
2,no soy de nadie,es un disco que por cuestiones de disqueras dejaron de vender en Mexico no es de las mejores producciones pero tiene buenas rolas y que una empreza te lo venda y te lo envie con la calidad de amazon es de lo mejor asi cual quier cosa la tendras sin ningun contratiempo gracias por todo
1,Give it a BIG MISS!,"I was EXTREMELY dissapointed when this book arrived in the mail. my first impression?? what a waste!. Im a gehry fan through n' through dont get me wrong, i rate gehry in the top 5 architects of all time. however it would be wiser to spend your money on ""The complete works: Frank O.Gehry"" (now thats a fab book!!) or ""Gehry talks"" etc, etc. This book is TINY, a little bigger than your hand. it does have o.k pictures but its certainly not worth the US$15 i paid for it......what did i do with it? lets just say it was great for compost!."
1,Disorganized and testimony did not inspire me,"I was looking for more of a devotional I guess. The scripture verses are mostly obscure and emphasize eating Christ's body and drinking His blood - the way it was framed bordered on creepy. Additionally, the testimonies were from people with a lot of problems - adultery, abuse, and just soap opera fodder. One was from a woman whose life was turned around and it listed her starting weight at 356 and current 327. The book seems to be targeted at the morbidly obese but the diet itself isn't sound for those individuals, or anyone. Fasting and super restriction of calories isn't healthy or reasonable. Good fats and good carbs and exercise is the way. The book was just a depressing melodrama for me. I agree with the other reviewer that this guy is full of himself without reason and I would add, exploitive of the desperate."
5,The best program for weight loss,This has been a very positive experience. It is more than a weight loss program. It is a spiritual growth developer. Weight loss happens as you grow closer to the Lord. It is wonderful. I plan to stay on it the rest of my life. I have lost 22 pounds but have a greater realization of approach to food.
4,A little cheesy but fairly spot on,"I am not finished with the book, but it has been helpful so far. I would say that if you go into it with a bad attitude like me, it doesn't help. Some of the time it says things in cheesy or slogan type ways. (That turns me off... I personally skip the questions.) However I think they have a lot of true and right things to say and it is being helpful to me as it would be to most Christians who genuinely want to seek God. I like that they put the focus on God and not your weight so you can apply the things in it to other areas of your life. It wouldn't do much for non-christians. Overall, I recommend it."
5,Seek Ye First...,"Though I don't actually own this book I have taken the online course and I LOVE IT! The principles of seeking first the Kingdom of God and having the things of this life fall into proper perspective, is so true. The focus of this program is God Himself and honoring Him in every aspect of our lives. As we do this food also takes its correct place in our lives and results in weight loss and overall better health. This new and dynamic approach to weight loss was revolutionary to me. I have tried to lose weight on several other diet plans and though they worked for awhile they didn't address the problem of the heart and so were not permanent. This study addresses the heart which can lead to permanent changes in eating as well as in many other areas of life."
4,guitar grimoire,"great reference book, contains most chords & inversions.fret board scale note positions, very informative.this is no miracle book, that will show how to become a great guitarist.however it has all the information that a great guitarist need."
3,Good songs; could use spiral bound & strumming recommendations,"Good array of songs and novel anecdotes about camping.Would have been nice if it were offered as spiral bound so that the book would lay flat, especially since it was used around the camp fire without music stands.Doesn't give strumming recommendations. However, Jumpin' Jim's books don't tend to give this info."
5,Catnip Cigar,"My cats Love this product. It is the best catnip toy on the market. Your cat will thank you over and over, in their own way. Besides it is a riot watching your cat play with the cigar"
4,Another way of thinking architecture,"In a time in which everything is fast consumism, Pallasma invites the reader to feel and ""sense"" the architecture in a different way, while providing some background info on the importance and history of the ranges and values that the human senses have played in development of the individuals and their perception. A nice text that pulls architects and interior designers into a different sphere of thinking and thus can guide them into creating more sensible designs to human needs."
5,The secet of the virgin Mary,This book helps you understand the life of the virgin Mary and what are religious talk wrong about her because they do know the truth.
5,One of the Best books I've read,"I love this book, it shows in a very human way the life of our dear Lord Jesus through the eyes of Mary. It helped me so much to understand better the Gospels, in a very simple way. I couldn't put the book down until I finished it."
4,BoYs FoR pElE,"definately, if you liked the cd, you were constantly thinking"" i wish i could play like that."" Definately a good source to learn how to play the music that drives you."
5,AMAZING,"If you are a music junkie, specifically, the Foo Fighters, this is the documentary or you. Wonderful, they are very open in this doc."
5,Absolutely Amazing,"Even the most casual Foo Fighters fan will appreciate how detailed this documentary was. From Grohl's start with Nirvana, to the Foo's early turmoil, and ending on a high note as one of the greatest rock bands of all time, you will be both informed and captivated by their story. Very well done and well worth the price."
5,Excellent Foo Fighters Documentary,"Well balanced, honest documentary about the Foo Fighters and all of its past members. Even though this is clearly still the Dave Grohl show (and friends), it offers interesting insights into the dynamics of the band and their recording process. One of the best rock documentaries ever."
4,Gift,"I bought this for my 19 year old brother, who's a big Foo Fighters fan. He said he went to bed to 'Wresting Light' after watching this album -he loved it. I bought it, convinced he would like it because of the reviews of previous buyers. Thanks!"
5,This is an awesome documentary!!!!!,Great movie for anyone wondering about how the Foo Fighters made it through the past 16 years. Can't get enough of it!-shiny penny[...]
4,Brutally Honest Documentary ! But Where's The Wasting Light Footage?,"I saw this in the theater and loved how honest everyone was. At first I thought it might be a put-on because the drummer that lasted, I think, one album before being replaced talked about getting ""the phone call"". Its a testament to Grohl that he was able to get everyone into a studio to talk honestly about their experiences. A lot of great information in this!After the documentary, the Foo Fighters played the entire album, Wasting Light, in a studio somewhere and it was great. It should be included with this to recreate the entire experience. Hopefully it will someday..."
5,So amazing.,"I was one of the lucky few who got to see this video when it was first premiered in select theaters. I was hesitant to attend because I had no idea what to expect and didn't want my love for FOO to be lessened... but it was INCREDIBLE! It made me love them even more... a hundred times more! I'm comfortable saying that even people who aren't fans of their music will still love this video... it's humorous, emotional, captivating, and uplifting... and best of all it's a true story! It really allows you to have an intimate connection with Foo... I feel like I grew up with them now! I suggest checking it out.. now!"
4,Insightful and honest documentary,"Excellent documentary. The band being honest about what they went through, the ups and downs, and all those challenges that bands have to overcome to keep it going. Lots of lessons learned!"
4,"Learn a few new ""Foo-Facts"" Well made doc. Got a little bored near the end.",Foo Fighters are a great band to a great amount of people. I liked learning a few new things in this doc that I didn't know about Dave Grohl and the Foo Fighters before. The first half of it I really enjoyed. I started to get a bit bored when the whole Wasting Light pr0mo parts started. I like Wasting Light. But wouldn't consider it the landmark of their career. Only my opinion. Keep rockin Foo.
5,AWESOME GIFT,"Bought this for my nephew,not only did he receive it earlier than expected but LOVES the blue ray! Great video for music lovers, Foo Fighter fans!"
1,Cheap but not great.,"Have had problems with this card after very little use. Most card readers don't recognize it - both my photo printer and pc have error msgs. Videos taken on my camera can't be played back, but all my other memory cards work fine... not sure if this is a fault of the card or not, but seems likely. Good points - writes VERY fast and is usable if I download via a USB."
5,Excellent product,"I had used this brand of shampoo for over 11 years. I loved it. It was the only shampoo that I can use daily that doesn't build up or dry out my hair. Then suddenly it went off the market. I couldn't find it anywhere... I finally googled it and discovered they stopped making it.So, I began looking for a replacement. For about 2-3 years I never found anything that worked as well. I spent tons of money trying to find something that was at least close. I even spent about fifty bucks per bottle of Japanese shampoo.But suddenly I saw finesse on Walgreens shelf again. I bought a whole bunch of bottles right away. I think I should try to buy a life-time supply - just in case.And by the way, my husband loves the smell. Every time we hug and he gets close to my hair he says my hair smells so good."
4,Good value,High quality and good value. Keeps excellent time and the band is excellent. Good for aviators and people who want to look like aviators.
5,Very informative book,"This book packs a lot of information into it's pages. It works well as a book to sit down and read through and as a reference book. Very well laid out, good directions and pictures, very inclusive. I highly recommend it."
5,A revalation about Messien's Quartet For the End of Time,"Rebecca Rischin masterfully describes the terrible ordeal that confronted Messien when he wrote and presented his Quartet -The End of Time while he was a POW in a German camp.She gives musical insights into the complexity of Messien and his music. She also brings to life the differing personalities of the three musicians-violints, cellist and clarinets who performed the quartet on January 15 1941 in barracks of Stalag V!!!."
4,Fanciful Furniture,"I thought this was a fantastic book for the person who has some decorative paint and/or design experience. This book gives you very good instructions for specific and general projects, but does not give specific color info and would not be appropriate for the unsure beginner. The photos are beautiful and clear, and I felt really inspired with Ms. Rosenberg's fresh work and ideas. The recommnded reading and resources in the back is fantastic--I found a new paint supplier and saved money. Plus the author puts her personnel information in the book. I had a question and emailed her regarding something I was unclear about in the book, and she responded with an answer within a few hours. Great Book--I refer to this book more than any other in my painting library."
4,the cover's not so bad...,"But it might not do this book justice. This book is an unusual combination of twenty-something coming-of-age and sophisticated variations of the theme of spying. The author ruminates elegantly about the nature of memory, the construction of self, the difference between what is false and what is true, and she draws on sources from literature and popular culture to illustrate her points-from Woody Allen to the X-Files, Nabokov and Dostoyevsky. It's a difficult balance to strike, not doubt, but I have to applaud her ambition. I think this book is way more complex than the descriptions may imply, but for the most part, it succeeds. It may put off people just looking for mind candy, which it's not, although it's still a good yarn."
1,obnoxious,"What should have been a quick, breezy read -- cover looks cute, story seems fun and lighthearted -- is instead sluggish and cliched, with the author desperately trying to interest readers in her exasperatingly dull personal life and even duller work (it's like being a P.I., only not as cool, apparently).So much of this book is obviously not true that Ms. Gray may as well have just written a novel and been done with it. All the characters are stereotypes that are just ludicrous when not also offensive and borderline racist. The exception is the narrator, of course, the Carrie Bradshaw wannabe who always has a bon mot for every occasion and even though she's clearly a pampered, snotty rich kid to the ends of her fingers, tries to pass herself off as truly unique and not a caricature like the rest of the unfortunates depicted here. Maybe some heart was revealed somewhere, but I have to admit to skimming about a third of this one.Boring and trite, a poor start to a career in writing."
2,Quick but Forgettable Read,"I read this at the beach last summer and can barely remember it now, so I guess that's a critique in its own right.Spygirl is the memoir of Amy Gray, late 90s career girl who stumbles into a job at a Manhattan detective agency. This is soooo much less interesting than it sounds, because Ms. Gray spends most of her time like the protagonists of lots of other gen-x/chick lit type memoirs, fretting about relationships and drinking expensive coffee drinks. I picked this book up hoping to find out what it's *really* like to work in a modern day detective agency, but apparently it's a lot like the work environment of just about any other urban cube farm, and not nearly as interesting as you would think.I did finish the book despite an overall sense of disappointment but as I said, I can barely remember it now, so there are probably books that are a better option for your 3-4 hours of reading time."
5,A SUNNY MORNING WELL SPENT,I bought this book for the cover--yummy and pink--and so was the book--like candy--it was sweet and entertaining. Highly recommended if you like Sex and the City-like capers and spy stories. I'd like to see the author do something more with her keen observations of dialogues and people.
1,Bad Bad Bad,"I guess you have to be from New York to understand but I have never found barf (she's sick all the time from drinking all night) all that entertaining. Gray refers to throwing up at least three times in the first 4 chapters. This book left a bad taste in my mouth. I had a hard time reading it all the way through. All the big words in the world can't cover up lack of writing skills. I think this book perpetuates the myth that all PI's are sleezy. If all PI's were like Gray's, no one would ever hire a private investigator. Yuck!"
1,What am I missing here?,"It's not so much the twelve dollars I wasted on this book. I can live with that. It's three hours out of my life that I wasted and can never get back. The money that Random House spent on this book would have been put to better use by buying toner cartridges for their New York offices. I kept turning the page, waiting for something to happen. Damn, I hope to God I was never this pretentious thirtyfive years ago. The writing style is a cheap knock-off of so many other angst-driven gen-X authors. I'm reading this book and thinking: do I really care about what happens to Amy Gray? Unfortunately, I don't. At least, not enough to keep turning the page."
3,Speaking as a Spygirl myself...,My best friend bought this book for me once I became a PI. I avoided the book for a few months and then decided to check it out.There isn't much spying going on in the book. It seems to be more about her relationships with various men. I was going to give up halfway through the book but I kept waiting for something to happen.
3,"Good picture quality, but longevity/price ratio lacking","I was very surprised to be purchasing my third bulb for the Optoma HD72 projector in two years of relative moderate use (definitely below the rated hours). I got one extra with the original projector purchase on a packager deal, and when I the second one indicated it was nearing end-of-life I had a difficult decision whether to dump another couple hundred into a 1080i projector replacement bulb or to upgrade the projector. In the end it looked like prices on 1080p projectors with similar throw/picture size characteristics would like come down over the next year or so by the same amount or more for the cost of the bulb. I won't be buying a fourth bulb, I'll be upgrading the projector, and Optoma won't be my first choice. Installation was fairly straightforward, but a bit involved (required removing projector from the universal projector mount). Connections seemed robust and secure."
4,Review-Why Didn't you get me out,"The book was very enlightening in that it told me (I am not a military person - just a novice on POW's) two things that I did not know. One, that there were very few POW survivors from the prison camps versus the more publicized Hanoi Hilton. Two, author Frank Anton reveals that the military knew where he and others were kept captive. After his release he is shown a picture of himself walking from the camp to Hanoi. This book also makes one think - how would they have handled the captivity. One can be quick to condemn certain prisoners for their so call ""collaboration"" with the enemy, but the question is how much can one take before he/she breaks.In general it was a very good book - it described the POW camp without going into gruesome details."
5,rayjoy@ipa.net,"Frank has written an outstanding book. Altough I firmly beleive that there are some of our guys that stayed in Nam by choice I am as convinced that there are many that were kept as pawns and our government didn't have the guts to go get them. Am very proud to have served in the military with men of the caliber of men like Frank. Thank you Frank for writting this book to let the people of our great country,just how gutless our Leaders were. Roadrunner 6 Out"
4,Changed My Life,"God used this book to change my life back when it was just a photocopied 3-ring binder. A group of us studied it together for a semester, and for the first time I understood what it meant to truly follow Christ and how to help others walk with me.Since that semester over 10 years ago, I've gone on to become a university minister. I use the principles I learned in this book every day. Highly recommended."
1,Her popularity....,"I think the songs are kinda nice, but the voice isn't very good. I think she sounds like a Chipmunk. She has an annoying voice, which explains her poor unpopularity among audiences."
1,Graciela Beltran has an unusual voice..,"This CD has many good songs, but the voice is very strange. I am a music teacher and I often use this singer as an example of what NOT to do. Her voice is too thin, and annoys. Her vibrations are too close from one another. Dont enjoy it AT ALL."
3,"Bleak House Cliff Notes, use with care","It may seem to be stating the obvious, but the Cliff Notes for Bleak House are very superficial. The attempt to find ""symbols"" in each chapter often seems to be over-reaching. It ought to be obvious that Cliff Notes are an assist, not a substitute, for reading the book. For example, the Cliff Notes report that Tom Jarndyce merely ""attempted"" suicide -- no, in the book he definitely succeeded in killing himself."
4,very useful,Read this online to fill in uncertainties of the plot/characters relationships to each other on the bbc drama version of the book. Purchased with dvd for family who don't use the internet often to help them as well!
3,Not what you expect,"The book is simply a list bibliographic references for historic artifact identifcations and historic sites archeology. All are old references. What is good about it is that the author gives you a brief synopsis of what is in some of the books and articles. Also tells you which are the best references to have. Good if you are looking for older references. There is a lot of Williamsburg, Floridia, and southwestern references included."
5,A Perfect Mystery Series for Young Girls,"My six year old daughter loves these books, and I agree with her. The protagonist is a clever girl who solves mysteries primarily through visual clues. The story stops from time to time and alerts the reader to figure out some question before proceeding, which is very helpful. The difficulty level is about age 6-12, and it's a fun series for both kids and grownups."
4,good for the price,"Bought this planer direct from manufacture on sale for 99.00,can't bit the price,just received today, setup is easy,only put the fence on and square it, the table and blade is aligned by default, manly to use for 2x4, didn't mess with the default setting on height adjustment, just make more passes little by little and things come out great, if just for hobby use,this works good,come with 2 push block and setup tools also. The table is 28-1/4 x 6-1/8, yes this thing is loud, I wear the ear plug and still think it is loud, it also get the 2-1/2"" dust chute. Be aware the fence is a little wobble left and right,but it is secure 90 degree no problem, just don't put excess pressure."
3,"""sorry, not buying it""","Although I enjoyed the way this book was written it is very witty and I laughed out loud at several points throughout the book and it did manage to hold my attention throughout. I wonder how much of this book is embelished not that there is anything wrong with a little embelishment for the sake of an interesting read.As an escort myself I purchased this book in hopes of getting a better perspective of the clients point of view. However certain encounters the author claims to have had with escorts just seem a little far fetched to me.The author writes 'all of these accounts are real, not even the names have been changed'If they are all true I feel sorry for him as he seems to have fallen prey to so many scams and unproffressional behaviour from escorts although perhaps he only remembers the bad ones just as we 'escorts' tend to always remember the bad clients.Book was a little slow in the beggining but did make for a very entertaining read."
1,Don't buy this gadget!,This is absolutely useless gadget. My version didn't reduce the noise but actually gave me a hissing sound on the right ear. Contacting JVC was fruitless. I still haven't gotten a reply to my complaint 1 month ago.Do yourself a favour and save your money... I get more noise reduction with Creative ear plugs
2,doen't work as it said,when you turn on noise cancelation in a noise enviroment. It create a high pittch noise in your ear ( it is noise generator )
1,Disapointing,"Active noise cancellation has been around nearly as long as helicopters (as that is a primary use).With that in mind, I certainly expected more.If you would like to listen to music with cancellation, these might be for you (or you could use your existing headphones and simply turn up the volume).If you are hoping for quiet, you will not find it with these.Although they do provide some noise reduction for some sounds, you will be far better served with a cheap set of earplugs."
1,"good sound, good angle, BUT noise cancelation is poop","These headphones are good, they sound good for the price and I love the angle it goes straight to your inner ear, but the noise cancelation piece is worthless, I cut that piece off and solder to a reg headphonejack and the sound still the same, so unless you know how to solder and have the equiptment to do it go ahead and do the same if not, don't waste a dime.noise cancelation does not work, it's a phony. they just add a bit of white noise to make you think that: ""there is some ambient noise cancelation""."
2,No significant noise reduction,I purchased these lower priced headphones with relatively low expectations for significant noise reduction. I did however expect them to make some difference. I was wrong about them making a difference and my expectations were far too high as it turned out. I could not tell the difference between these and regular non noise cancelling headphones.
2,Poor expectations,"Although excited when received, very disappointed when used. The phones did not seem any better then the one I was using. The base sound was just fair and the noise canceling did not seem any different. Would not reccomend this product. Sorry..........."
1,Worst earphones ever,"Received and returned JVC ""Noise Canceling Earphones"". I haven't used any kind of earphones that tinney since the early days of the first transistor single-ear phones. The JVC is far worse. In fact, I think now that they must have been defective. I've gone back to the $3 earphones that came with my 1980's walkman."
3,"Very nice, small, good ear seal",This unit does a good job of canceling continuous noise such as in an airplane but does not seem to respond to random or sudden noise. The excellent seal to the ear canal blocks most sound even when the unit is off. My unit arrived dead but was replaced in about 10 days with no hassle.
3,More simple version of Body Sculpting Bible,"If you have the original Body Sculpting Bible for Men, this one differs slightly because of its focus on slimming down and getting more defined. If you want to build muscle onto a skinny frame get the original book. If you need to replace some winter fat with muscle and definition, this is the book for you."
2,Good idea in theory...,"My daughter received this kit as a Christmas gift. It seemed like a fun project, and she enjoyed creating her own custom shiny cardboard tiara. Unfortunately, the tiara is really only nice to look at; every time she touches it something falls off of it. I'm not sure if it's the glue or just having to glue it on the shiny surface of the cardboard, but it doesn't work out in practice. I would suggest that anyone interested in making play tiaras use a different product, maybe try a craft store."
3,Not up to the standard of the others in the series,"This was trite in comparison to the previous novels, and Bork's introspection isn't enough to carry the whole book. The Matadora Trilogy(ish) had a lot of depth for space opera, which made it very enjoyable... I was disappointed with Brother Death - however, I'm still looking for a copy of Albino Knife, so I couldn't have been THAT disappointed... :)"
1,You get what you pay for.,The car adapter doesn't stay in the phone. The plug constantly slips out.Same with the Earpiece plug.Not worth the money or the hassle.In this case I got what I paid for.10 bucks for three items that all work at a substandard level.
3,Got what I paid for,"I did not expect top quality for the price but overall it fits my needs. I was mostly interested in the car charger and it seems to be working just fine. It fits well in my outlet (Saab) as well as in the phone. The leather case is improperly stitched and likely won't last long. The earbud is actually not too bad. The sound on my end is not the best but at least I can hear clearly. People on the other end say it sounds fine. Not very convenient to wear, but again, I got what I paid for."
5,Helen Keller,"...It's about a girl that is blind, deaf, and dumb. (As in can't talk) But later when she got a teacher named Anne Sullivan, she learned to do lots of things. When Helen was ten years old, she learned to talk. But still could not hear. I learned that if you are blind, deaf, or dumb, you could still do lots of things. I think you would like this book too.I think all different kinds of people would like this book because people whoever likes biographies would like this book too."
3,interesting subject,I am fascinated by Helen Keller she was an amazing person. This book could have done a better job portraying the lonnliness of a girl who can't communicate in any way. This is a good book for younger children with long attention spans. This book wasn't very gripping but gave an outline on Helen's life. So there is probably a better book on her out there on the subject but if you don't want a detailed compelling read you might as well buy it.
3,Trudeau: As Arrogant as Ever,"It has been said of Pierre Trudeau that he was Canada's most influential Prime Minister. After reading his Memoirs, it is fair to say that he certainly thinks so. This book was little more than Trudeau deciding to tell his readers how great he was and continues to be. Mr. Trudeau did not add any significant information to his already credible biographies that had been written, such as Trudeau and His Times Volume One and Two. It is also striking that Mr. Trudeau avoided discussion of his years of marriage with Margaret Trudeau in any great detail. When one writes memoirs, it seems reasonable to expect that more than just a review of public life would be put on display. Pierre Trudeau certainly was an interesting character in a country that has had too few interesting characters in its history. Overall, however, Memoirs failed to provide any material of substance, except perhaps those readers who wanted glossy photographs of Pierre Trudeau"
1,THE AUTHOR OF CANADA'S MISFORTUNES,In retrospect history will judge Trudeau as an unmitigated disaster for Canada. Many mistook his arrogance and aloofness for intellectual stature. The only thing greater than the sycophantic love displayed by some Canadians for Trudeau was his absolute contempt for Canadian voters.
4,Couldn't Put It Down!,"Jeff Kosakow hit the mark with ""The Blind-Date King"". I started the book one evening, and couldn't put it down. The wit, humor and heartbreak of Tim Wolfe, looking to score a date for an upcoming wedding keeps the pages turning. Anyone who has ever had a blind date, a crush, heartbreak or been in love will find something to relate to in this book.Highly recommended, fast fun read."
5,Spanish text book,I received this text book very quickly and it was in excellent shape! I would not hesitate to do business with this seller again.
1,poor reproduction,"The cover is nice, the text is reproduced from an earlier volume. That would be fine, but halfthe pages arrived printed so lightly as to be unreadable. My copy will be entirely unusable."
2,Do you Believe in copying Cher? Anna Vissi does!,"Anna is Greece's best selling female Diva, and for her first international effort she decides to come across as a copy cat rather as an original artist. The song is simply an inferior copy of Cher's smash hit ""Believe"". By using the same production team, Anna has made sure that the song is as similar to the Cher smash as possible. The Eiffel 65 remix sounds as inspired as their own Blue hit. The rest of the remixes are not worth a mention and the extra track is laughable.If Anna is serious about an international career, she needs to realize that Karvelas is NOT the guy to write the songs for her. His ability to rip-off international hits is well known (his Demons rock opera was a poor man's Phantom of the Opera, recorded on a string budget and sounded like a high school project gone astray), but to make it in the highly competitive European market, Anna needs world class composers and producers. This cd single is only for the hard core fans."
4,told me just what I wanted to know,"I had in mind a project that needed two particular leatherworking skills - box stitching and moulding leather - and had found many many books which told me in great detail just how to do a thousand other things, much rarer and more complex.Then I found this book - clear, informative, and reassuring. Bravo!Richard Byrne"
2,"Part what I expected, not enough of what I didn't.","For anyone new to leatherworking, this book will guide you through the basics and give you a solid foundation. And it's refreshing to see a book covering techniques other than Western style leatherwork. It covers the basics of a few belts and bags, and has a couple simple unadorned patterns.It might have just been my expectations, but there's not much in here that isn't covered by other books. The patterns are nice, but there's only 10 of them. There's some info on molds and some little things, but the majority of the book is almost too ""beginner level"" for me. I was looking for a bit more patterns and variety of projects. Even though I was a bit disappointed, it is still a decent book."
4,Not a novice book,"This book is one of the most detailed books that I have ever read on leather working. It is an older book but well worth the read. It does not encourage the use of quick work around setups. If you are serious about working leather then you need to read this book.I only gave it 4 stars because it really does assume you have some experience. If you are just starting out this would not be the one to start with. The ""easy"" projects still require a lot of tools and skill. I would recommend getting some kits first and then making a few simple designs yourself, then getting this book."
3,This book offers nothing unique above the many others,Although the illustrations are well done I don't see a reason to buy this if you own the Stallman books.
1,Not Quite The One.,"I found this handbook disappointingly superficial.It makes to many assumptions that the reader is an experienced leather-worker, and is very short on instruction.This writer has had some expert tutelage from master craftsmen, but I still found a considerable deficit in detail.A pity, as the projests are interesting, but, in most instances, too complex for a beginner.I could not recommend this book!"
3,Big disappointment--No extras,"Just opened this set and I wish I hadn't, cause it would be going right back to Amazon. There are *no extras* included with this set. I've Netflixed the original DVDs which have all the textless openings and closings and a bunch of other stuff. This set has the episodes and nothing else.I do love the series and had been looking forward to getting this set.Well maybe Funimation with issue a DVD with the extras on it..."
1,Great series but the discs don't work,This is easily one of the funniest series I've seen but this is not a good release. Everyone I've talked to who owns this has mentioned that Disc 3 doesn't work in their DVD player. I tried it out with my copy and had the same issue. A DVD release that doesn't actually play in DVD players is about as bad as it gets. I'm surprised others haven't mentioned this in their reviews but I guess stuff like that happens when you review a product weeks and months before it's even released.
1,Not appropriate for young kids,"Fro reading review I thought this would be good for kids (12). Lots of bad language and weird not understandable sequence of events. Even I didn't understand it! Oh well. Not sure what others are raving about, it's very unitelligible at best."
4,Flat out hilarious!,"This series is likeSchool Rumble: The Complete Series (Seasons 1, 2 and OVA), but a little more whacky. If you want a cheap laugh, this is a great buy. I liked it a lot."
5,Great for a low price,"I never got to watch the whole anime before and this was the first time I'd seen one of the S.A.V.E box sets, so I just bought it and just as long as you don't mind having no extras then this is really good buy."
4,Extremely Silly.,"Rebecca has started her new job teaching high school. She's an 11 year old genius. This makes it hard for her to relate to her students, whom all have major personality quirks. Their day to day life is filled with dopiness and insanity.The best things about this anime are the animation and comedy. It's extremely strange, so don't try to understand it. Just get past the first 5 episodes and enjoy all of the goofiness that comes. If you can get a close up picture of the cover; then you can get a get a good idea of how Paniponi is drawn. The color shading and character designs are very unique and cool. There are also some pretty good voice talents in this one. It's not one of the better animes I've seen, but it's definitely funny and good mindless entertainment."
3,A different slant on events,"Firstly if this is the only book on Franklin you have read its quite a good read if your looking for a read based on scietific facts try ""Frozen in Time"", they both share the same research but have similar conclusions. This is more of a novel and in some ways is better for it as it gives animation to the characters."
3,A good read,The book is well written and a good read. The author researched causes for the tragedy and his hypothesis of what may have happened. I found his research on food borne diseases etc fascinating. This book will definitely peak your curiousity and get you interested in other related books.
2,A Fast (but forgettable) Summer Read,"If you are interested in books about polar exploration, this is a quick summer read. The author presents his hypothesis as if it were fact. While I found it enjoyable, if you are looking for a more memorable read, check out ""Endurance"" and ""The Worst Journey in the World""."
1,Doesn't work with XP,"Difficult to install, and then it won't run. I had to startup in safe mode just to get the install to work. The intro runs fine( which you can't bypass by the way), but the game freezes as soon as the intro is over. No fixes available on their website other than to update DirectX and your other drivers, and i already had all the latest drivers. The best tip of all from their user guide and website: ""if the above doesn't work then the program will not run on your computer."" Well that's a great help. Perhaps if you are still running Windows 98 or ME this might work for you. Otherwise stay away."
3,A Little hard for 3 year olds,"My three year old enjoys seeing Stewart on the computer, but I think she doesn't understand the concept of most of this game.She likes doing the dot-to-dots and then coloring them but it was to hard for her.I found no setting to make it easier for her to play."
3,A bit tough for 4 year old,"I got this for my 4 year old. There are a couple of games he can play ok but I think most are a bit above his head yet. I thought the Dr. Seuss Kindergarten games had a lot more variety, were more fun, and much better suited for a 4 year old. Plus Dr. Seuss has 3 levels of difficulty for each ""game"" which means he can play now and increase his learning as he masters each game. He likes the Dr. Seuss ones better."
1,The worst IPAQ ever,This is my second IPAQ in 3 years. I loved the first one I had until the screen died on me. I had this one for only 4 months and now the screen doesn't repond to my Stylus. I contacted support and no help. The warranty is only 90 days and now it is expired. So I am left now with no option but paying for its repair. Not sure if it's worth it.
2,Didn't want to tap anymore,My RX3115 worked like a charm. beautiful display. onboard memory is very small - buy a card and store all your stuff on it. had no problems synchronising with my regular computer. bought it in February '06 and now it won't respond to my stylus anymore. grrrr......
2,Not a good quality product,"I bought this item in March and had to replace it because battery dry out within 24 especially if you forget to disable the wireless even the machine is off. The product was replaced and same issues emerge till it stop working in 2 months. I do not rememeber how many times I had to put all my data becasue the back-up get drained after the orignial battery. I finally decided to return the product for credit. I will look for something else.Just so you know that product works very well and very user friendly, but if you are willing to charge it every 12 hours, its not worth it."
1,Media software does not work,"I bought the RX3115 so that I could stream music to the device from my desktop. However, the mobile media software would never connect to my desktop. After spending 1 1/2 hours on hold, I was told that the help desk could not get it to work either and that they would send the problem up the ladder. I got a call back today, and was told that the support staff in Houston could also not get it to work, and they had no answers on how to fix it. As such, I am returning it. Do not buy this if you are interested in this feature! It is a shame because otherwise it is a really nice device..."
4,engineer,"The purchase of the product was done very professionally.I would recommending doing business with the people I purchased this product. They have been very considerate and understanding.Thanks,Bob Parmley"
1,a big dud,"The device worked fine until I tried to load the software, which would not install. I tried to contact tech support, they were worthless. There was a language barrier that took several minuets to over come. When that bridge was crossed she told me to ""up grade"" my OS and basically told me my computer was broken which it is not. I took it back the next day. I do not believe the tech person I spoke to has any advanced knowledge of computers based on our conversation. Horrible tech support and no real solutions offered"
3,pc pocket,"at first there is not camera in this model. An secondly, there is a problem whith de earphone output, the volume for the earphone is very low, so you can not ear a thing."
5,The prefect PDA,"I preordered this pocket pc about 2 weeks ago and recieved it las week, and I am in love with it. I control my tv, dvd, audio reciever, and my HP zd7000 laptop with it, and can also chat in msn and surf the web (in landscape mode, it is MUCH better for web surfing) from my bed using wifi, and I can also connect it with my t-610 using blue tooth.The features on this PPC are great, and everything you need comes included. It is one of the smallest Pocket PCs, and is also vey light, and it looks very sleek and modern.I recommend this to everyone who has the need for an entertainment PDA or for a business PDA .Excellent Product, thoroughly recommended."
3,Buyer beware,"ProsStandard Microsoft Office Power Point, Excel & Spread sheetsDecent MP3s, video and picture slide show abilityWork as a remote for almost any deviceLoading and running softwareWorks great with pocket quickenBattery lifeConsLimited memory with out memory cardsExiting a program doesn't stop it from running which slows the deviceHARDWARE! The touch screen always fails after the warrantyRecommendYes, under $50.00 with extended warranty"
2,Great device - died young,I bought this to replace a Palm Tungsten I used for business contacts and scheduling. The IPAQ worked great - all the multimedia stuff works as advertised - Windows software is a little klutzy but you get used to it. Just when I was beginning to really like it and trust it (about two months) everything on the memory card disappeared. Checked everything out and the memory card is ok - the IPAQ just can't read it. I googled it and the problem is widespread. The device is in a drawer until I can get up the will to throw a nearly three hundred dollar device in the trash. I went back to the Palm. It ain't all that cute but I trust it with my data.
2,Short Lived,"I loved my machine, until it DIED after only 8 months. First the touch screen got 'touchy' then it stopped working at all and then the machine refused to power on. I also don't like the fact that 'closing' the program is actually only minimizing it. The other problem is that surfing took forever for any sort of graphics."
4,Desde Barinas Venezuela.,"Producto bien interesante y acorde al precio. Lo unico que le falta es el enlace con vieja Data como la de Palm, deberia convertir directamente para los que nos iniciamos con este tipo de producto hace varios años.Saludos..."
4,Fabulous book - why didn't I learn of this earlier?,"This book could be a life-saver for many women who have been dating dangerous men half their lives. Sure, there are so any categories of dysfunctional men that it begs the question: are there any normal single guys left? However, I think it is better to at least know what you're in for with each personality type."
4,Worth the price and a re-read or two,"I liked this book enough to buy a second and give it to a friend. If you enjoy the ""victims"" channel--you know the one--(I do not) this is the book for you. It will make you rethink your old or current bad relationships. It won't solve all your bad picks, you have to do that work inside, but it will open your blind eyes. The best advice: If a ""red flag"" pops us, PAY ATTENTION AND MOVE ON, stop making excuses and explanations. Go read that review by the person who defends sticking around with her mental illness guy before you buy the book, then read it after. She is a classic example....."
5,This book should be titled,"'How to spot a dangerous person.' If you take a truthful look into the past you might see a feminine presence there that acted just like the characters described in this book. You could also get a glimpse of your own manipulative, maladaptive traits. Great! Get to Work! The only way to clean the machine is to examine the hardware and repair what is broken. Sandra Brown explains the details and gives examples on how to get started.Highly recommended for those walking wounded who continue to stagger through the minefield in search of answers. Get into a relationship with yourself first. Be honest and see what happens!"
2,Eh...,"This book is okay. One chapter pertained to me, but this is more for the woman who needs serious help spotting blatantly bad men. Most of the kind of men outlined in this book I would not go near with a 10' pole anyway (for the very reasons they say in the book), so it just wasn't for me or my particular men issues."
3,Great read,"This is a great book but not as good as i expected it to be. I would recommend it for younger women and teenagers. I am 21 but I felt like there was very little that I've learned from it. I guess I already was aware of how to spot one, and most of the red flags or signs that are explained in the book I already was aware of. Women should never stop trusting their instincts."
3,not much i didn't already know...,"i didn't learn much from this book. i suppose it would be helpful to women new to dating. i seriously think that if more women would pay attention to their intuition when dating, they'd save themselves a lot of hurt and heartache."
4,Keith Urban 1991,it is an ok CD not the type of music I am used to listen to from him but still good.
4,early prediction of immense talent,I have followed closly all the current stuff and this early cd from OZ really shows his early voice and beginings of KU. I listened to it while reading the Jeff Apter book (ignoring the some inaccuracies) and it stays in my cd rack.
3,I am a HUGE K.U fan...,"but this CD is like nothing that I have ever heard him sing before. I hate to say it, but the songs almost remind me of a television theme song. The music is more instrumental with lots of piano, just not what I am used to. I have only listened to it once since I purchased on Amazon.com, so maybe it will grow on me? But, it's NOTHING like Golden Road or his previous CD."
5,The Phantom Perfume Rocks...,"Well, I got this product as a Christmas gift for my sister last year. It's her favorite perfume and it's been hard to find and I just happened to look here and they had it. I was for one thrilled, because I wanted to buy it for her and of course she loved it..."
4,Lovely,"I bought this perfume for my daughter because I thought the bottle was pretty. She has a red, black and white bedroom and the bottle looks gorgeous on her dresser. The scent is nice. It's a soft, old-fashioned scent and reminds me of something that women in the 1800's might have actually worn."
2,Old,"This fragrance has been discontinued for years. The only ones available have been sitting on a shelf somewhere losing their freshness. This is the last bottle I will purchase because they are now so aged, the original fragrance is gone. I'm surprised markets are still selling it like it's good! I had no problems with the seller - but if you are a fan of the original fragrance of Phantom of the Opera, the way it smelled over a decade ago - you will not be getting that fragrance any more. I just don't understand why they discontinued it!!!"
2,"Great Bottle, Poor Fragrance","I bought this perfume on a whim because I love the Phantom of the Opera musical, the fragrance sounded good and the bottle is beautiful. However, the only reason I'm keeping it is because the bottle looks great on a dresser. The perfume is awful. It smells like medicine and men's cologne. Very disappointed."
5,Catnip Nip Pillow,These small catnip pillows are a favorite with my cats. They prefer the small size because it is easier to play with and cuddle up to. Highly recommended!!!
3,Comments,"It is a nice book, a useful reference for anybody interested in civil/commercial aviation, especially Africa, noticeably one of the less ""aviation-known"" continents...Anyway, hard-line fans and historians (as myself....) will soon discover some typing mistakes, some gaps here and there, some miscoordination between carriers (mostly those which changed name and ownership along their operational life), some duplications.A second (amended) issue would be very welcome. Fully incorporated/registered names of many carriers - especially those from French-speaking nations - must be corrected and spelled in the right way...."
5,this is a must read,I enjoyed this book as well as Pam Blackwell's first offering Ephriam's Seed. I just wish it had not been such a long wait between the books. She continues the storyline begun in the first book and one comes to understand the people involved better. It gave me a lot to think about like what my reactions to such events would be. I can't wait for the next book.
5,Datrek Cart Bag,Excellent value given by Amazon for this very nice cartbag. Free shipping and other discounts made the value even greater.
5,"Really Cute video with letters, numbers, and shapes",i was very impressed with this video. we were told by most of our friends to try juno but we had never heard of it. i had only heard of baby einstein or baby mozart which we didn't think was very interesting. this one is much cuter. the music is truly beautiful and the puppets make my son laugh out loud. he then wants me to talk like one of them. they also teach a bit about shapes and numbers. the thing i like about this video is that it gives children a lot more credit than most of the junk that's out there. my son really seems to appreciate the music which we'd love to find on cd somewhere.
3,It's pretty ... but,"This poster is really poor quality. It looks like the printer enlarged the picture incorrectly, and the pixels show terribly. It was really disappointing to get, because I love love love wolves, but I guess you get what you pay for. Shipping was a rip off. If I had to buy it again, I'd probably spend a little extra to get a bigger and better quality poster."
3,Informative but boring as sin,"Think of 1970's NJ fat slob teaching your kids both baseball and sportsmanship, complete with slice of pizza in mouth."
2,"Cheese was melted, good sausages","While this is not the fault of the Wisconsin Cheeseman, the cheeses were melted by the time they arrived to me. After 24 hours of refrigeration they were reanimated enough to eat. I enjoyed the Aged Cheddar, which had a slight amount of bite to it. I especially enjoyed the Mellow Cheddar mixed with some Colby. I was less than impressed with the Edam and Brick cheeses, but that may be personal preference as opposed to manufacturer's error."
3,It's ok,"The picture was not great, and the it was not wide screen, so the sides were cut off, It didnt say that in the decription of the item."
2,"luggage samsonite 32""","It is a good size for travel, but very unsteady after loading. This luggage will not stand, which is unfortunate. The company should add a support bar, as they have underneath the bag, at the bottom by the wheel: 1) to protect the fabric underneath, close to the wheel. 2)The fabric start to wear off because of non protective device. I am planning to whrite to the company and letting know about this design.Evelyne Parisien"
5,Masterful summation of the Christian faith,"I read lots of books on the Christian faith, but never before have I encountered one that pulls the faith's themes together into one powerful summation quite like this book does. The new covenant truly is the heart of our faith and this book uses simple, sometimes passionate language to bring the new covenant into focus. In particular, I was very impressed with the book's extensive and persuasive use of Scripture as the foundation for its message. If you want to gain a better and deeper understanding of your faith and make Christ truly alive in your life, then read this book! I am very glad that I did."
5,Amazing book!,This book is one of the finest Christian books I have ever read. It helped me to understand God's love in a deeper way than I ever had before and I highly recommend it to all.
2,Not Happy!,"I purchased this book and The Power of the Blood Covenant: Uncover the Secret Strength of God's Eternal Oath. What a suprised when I realized that they were the same book. I mean Identical. You write about convenant and then break it by deceiving the purchasers of the book. It definitely took away from my excitement of purchasing the book. Maybe, once I settle down, I will actually enjoy my ""one"" book that I purchased for the price of two."
3,Why can't shoes just be comfortable,"I only paid the lowest price marked for this shoe and I love denim, so I thought, ""What do I have to lose?"" I have a couple other pairs of the LifeStride brand and they are just a little on the narrow side so I went from a 9M, my regular size, to a 9W. The fit was dead on, however, they are not comfortable. They need more support on the ball of the foot area and my feet slide down the shoe due to the, ""heel is too high for me,"" and my toes scrunch up and hit the very end of the shoe. I packed the toe area with cotton balls hoping to ease the crunch but this didn't help much. I love how the shoe looks with the tie around the ankle feature but I will not sacrifice good looks for comfort. Needless to say, I am a disappointed shoe lover with this purchase."
2,Boring!,This textbook couldn't get any more boring. Plus my professor insisted that half the information in the textbook was wrong anyway. Waste of money.
2,signed inside,"It was in good condition but i wanted to give it as a xmas gift. But, it was signed to someone else inside. So, now I cant"
2,Extremely Basic,Unless you are VERY new to snowboarding I wouldn't recommend this product. You would be better saving your money and watching youtube for a better selection of how-to videos.
2,There are better read aloud stories!,As I was reading this book to my children last night. I was thinking about what the star level is on amazon. Well to my surprise it is rated as a perfect book. It is difficult to read since there are are bubbles everywhere. I understand that the story is supposed to be funny with the bubbles but some of the humor is lost in the confusion of who is talking during a read aloud. My child (6yo) thought parts were funny but other parts were over their head. I will be hiding this book as it was not fun to read. This is one of my least favorites out of a hundred book collection of stories.
4,I totally disagree with A Customer's review,"I tutor SAT and take various SAT tests regularly. SparkNotes SAT II Math books (both IC and IIC) are very close to the real test. There are typos in SparkNotes Math books, but very few compare to SAT books from most other prep companies/authors."
1,one star is given because no stars is not possible,This book covers very small portion of the topics. It is a waste of time and money!
1,Got the smallest one,I got this because it was the smallest rounded leather collar I could find. It was very scratchy for my dog which negates the purpose of a rounded leather collar. It had some glue or tar that they used to round it together and it had lots of scratchy bumps on the area touching the dogs neck.
5,I like this cutlass,I like this cutlass or short sword. Its sturdy and sharp and you can use the leather belt loop to attach it directly to your belt like any sheath knife. It is a short sword 25 inch blade so it kind of feels like a big machete or super huge bowie or something(with a sword like handle of course) Bottom line I am very pleased that I own it for self defense and I would buy another and I might buy more.
5,"Heavy duty and well built, just what you expect from Cold Steel","The blade feels like it could last and the grip is nice and solid. The leather scabbard is certainly nice enough, nothing spectacular but a bit nicer than I had expected. Not my first Cold Steel piece, nor will it be my last. Overall I would say it is fantastic quality for the price."
4,Ginnie's curiosity lands her in a mystery in Charleston!,"When Ginnie is invited to spend the Christmas holidays with a friend in the South, she longs for excitement. However, she does not bargain for anything as spooky as the mystery light on Lonesome Bay Road. Still, she is determined to find out what causes it. Is it the ghost of a Civil War slave looking for his wife? Is it related to black magic, voodoo, root doctors? Who is the flamboyant Doctor Turkey? Before Ginnie helps solve the baffling riddle, she learns something about superstition, ignorance, fear -- and evil."
2,The good does not outweigh the bad.,"In a word: meh. As others have commented, this series starts off great and then just flounders. The original quartet are the best of the bunch, particularly the first and third books. ""Dragon Wing"" was really great fun with an intriguing anti-hero and ""Fire Sea"" is compellingly sad. However, the final trilogy is so unfocused and confusing (wait, the Fifth Gate leads where?) that I'm stunned no one forced them to condense it into one book. So, the problem in recommending ""Dragon Wing"" and ""Fire Sea"" is that it saddles you with the other five books and I just don't think it's worth it. I found this series to be the beginning of the end for Weis and Hickman, where editors obviously found it difficult to force such celebrated authors to make changes."
2,Conclusion Most Dissapointing,"While I must admit that I am biased towards almost any Weis and Hickman book, I was stunned by the horrible ending of this otherwise excellent series. The conclusion was unfulfilling with several loose ends left unresolved. This book really does diminish the quality of the other six novels.In particular, Alfred's story arc comes to an abrupt end and we never learn the basis of his power. After several vague references to his past by Zifnab, I at least expected some sort of resolution.Additionally, like another reveiwer pointed out, the frequent use of acts of god to resolve conflicts was very irritating.I still enjoyed reading the series but am definitely left dissapointed in two of my favorite authors."
2,Not up to the standards set by the rest of the series...,"While I loved the first six books in the series, I was really disappointed by the ending- it seems to rely on many, many Deus Ex Machina additions to resolve the conflicts set up in the first six books... In particular, I didn't like the circumstances of Haplo's reappearance (""Just kidding, everybody! Group hug!""), and was very disappointed at the circumstances of Sang-drax's destruction.Honestly, it seemed to me as if Wies and Hickman didn't really know how to end the series, so they just threw something together at the last minute. There are at least one or two major plot holes in this one. While I'd like to stress that it's not a BAD book, it's also definitley not the best in the series."
2,Could have been much better,"I just finished this book about 10 minutes ago and I am extremely miffed that it ended the way it did. I cannot understand how a book series can go from being extremely detailed to just nothing at the end. What was the point of dragging the series on for 7 books if it was going to be ended with a dull moan. There was so much room for detail and if the book had another 10 chapters I believe it would have been much better. The ending of Hugh the Hand was a EXTREME letdown...he was just gone, very anticlimatic.Problems I had with it...SPOILER ALERT1) Became much to sappy towards the end2) Hugh the Hand dies without a parting word3) Haplos daughter never makes a entrance4) The final outcome of the two races was never discussed5) Who the heck was Zifnab6) The whole book just seemed rushed to be over with7) Inconsistencies throughout the book8) Just left with a sad feeling of ""THATS ALL???""I am glad I finished the series but in truth it was a major letdown."
3,Typos Abound,"I loved the series. However I was sorely disappointed in the Kindle version due to the enormous amount of typos. How does this happen? This is not a reflection on the authors, but the publishers. I have enjoyed many, many paper based novels from Tracy and Margaret and will again in the future. I will probably not buy anymore Kindle books because of this.Steve Shulze"
5,Wonderful,I loved the entire series. The saga was intoxicating. I wish however there was more. I really want to know what happens next. This can't be the end.
2,why end a fabulous series with this weak book.,"This was a great series, the characters were interesting, and the storylines were good.i have read hundreds (? thousands) of sci-fi and fantasy books, and this series was one of the best.i did not understand the ending and really feel disappointed.i wish they would follow up with another series of novels using the wonderful characters they have developed here, instead of writing many of the books they are doing now."
4,"In a Series of Greats, This was Good","However much I felt that this book was not on par with the other books of the series, I must say that I felt that they wrapped up the series nicely, with minimal holes in plot. In fact, in reading the last book I was pleasantly surprised by the ending, and that is hard to do. I recommend reading the entire series in order. I'll bet you'll want to go back and read it again. In short: same fabulous cast of characters with a number of new emotional outpourings in the least expected places."
1,A shockingly bad ending to decent series,"This book, the conclusion to a massive series which had some good moments, is shockingly bad. OK, Weis and Hickman aren't great writers at the best of times, but to lead the reader through the mass of worlds, characters, etc. only to end up with this dull, predicitable, un-dramatic book... its sad.Over all the best books of this series were #1, #3, and #4. There is almost no point in reading the last 3 books as they each decline in quality."
3,seventh gate not the end.,the death gate series is one of my favorite series.it was very good until this book came along.the seventh gate does not answer the questions it needs to.there is no resolution. i really care about haplo and alfred.i am truly frustrated with this incomplete ending.helpppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp meeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee.
2,Ugh.,"Dont get me wrong - I love all the Weis/Hickman books... but this one wasn't what I expected from my two fave authors. In the other ones, something flowed within that made me want to keep reading. In this one, I almost put it down on various occasions. It was only because I heard it was soo good that I kept reading. And then, Im sorry to say, I was very disappointed."
1,Disappointing,Uh guys what happened to your fantastique writing like i the Rose of the Prophet trilogy or the Darksword trilogy???
3,To Willy Boy,"I don't know if you will ever come back and read this but I felt like I should clear something up.Re:Mensch is a Hebrew word. It is not close to a Hebrew word, it is a Hebrew word. If you look it up, mensch means a person of integrity and honor. What are the authors trying to say here? That all people without ambition or power are full of integrity and honor. I read all seven books trying to understand the use of this word to no avail.Mensch is not a Hebrew word, it is a German word meaning man or person (as is mentioned in one of the footnotes). It became part of Yiddish with the meaning of a good person (a REAL man) and it might sometimes be used by Hebrew speakers the same way as by many English speaking Jews.So in other words the authors aren't saying anything very interesting, they just used an ""old"" German word for people in the same way they used all sorts of ""old"" words like Xer-tzar."
4,almost perfect,"An excellent conlusion to the series, The seventh gate continues to develop an intriguing plot. While I was hooked from the beginning, I would have liked to have had a longer conclusion. The ending is not exactly what you expect, though still good, but you will wish it was what you expected."
5,"The Seventh Gate, is this the end?","In this novel, Haplo, Marit, Alfred, and the dog are confronted with the greatest evil, their own. The dragon snakes of Chelestra, world of water, have come to the laberith to seal shut the Final Gate, to let the evil inside grow, and for them to ""grow fat."""
1,Don't bother,Don't waste your money on this. The charger broke within months. The earpiece wasn't together when I got it and the case was annoying. Couldn't use the camera with the top part of the case on the phone. The plastic tore within a few months because of having to take the top part off. Couldn't charge with the case on either. It wouldn't fit into the slot far enough for it to start charging.
5,Angela....wow!!!,"To be honest I have never been a big fan of mysteries...but Angela put it down in this book. I loved Kendra's character, she reminded me of someone in my circle of friends.This book packs a punch and just like the other person stated in their review...this book was such a ride that if you don't pay attention you might miss something. I don't want to give the story away, so buy it for yourself. You will enjoy Angela's great storytelling."
5,A New Sleuth Hits the Shelf,"Born and raised in Willow Ohio, Kendra Clayton is a small town girl that has yet make a break for the big city. She has good friends, a close family and two part time jobs that fill her life. That is until Jordan, her best friend's good for nothing, live in boyfriend winds up dead. The girlfriends keep a secret from the police and soon, Kendra finds herself implicated in the crime.If you're a fan of amateur-slueth mysteries, Angela Henry has crafted a well written story that keeps you guessing until the end.Move over Blanche and Tamara Hayle. Make room for Kendra Clayton!"
3,It was ok....,I didn't love it but I didn't hate it. I really wasn't interested until the end of the book.
3,"Not outstanding, but very solid textbook","This book is nearly 15 years old, but it's a respectable introductory PR text with some information not found in other texts of its kind."
4,exactly what it says,"This is a stuff sack that is for the Therm-a-Rest bag (each pad has its own size, make sure you get the correct one). The pad fits perfectly, and the bag itself is very light, and I haven't needed to do extensive testing, but it seems rain proof. You do have to roll the pad VERY tight to make it fit, but as a backpacker space saving should be second nature. if you just want a dry bag for random stuff, look elsewhere for cheaper, and more watertight bags."
3,Nice bag. Saves Space,"This is a nice sack. Strong material, but your paying for a brand name.The other reviewers who complained about the size must not be able to read as the size is in the description. Giving a product a bad review because you can't read the description is wrong."
2,Smaller than expected,"The bag was smaller than expected. I thought I was ordering the larger bag, but the picture was deceiving."
1,Fake and cheap fragance...,I choose this rate because it's the lower one...Because don't have a zero...The fragance is a fake...A cheap one.Anyway...I'll not purchase a perfume at Amazon anymore.
1,Aged Cologne,This cologne smelled sour when I received it. I believe it is old stock and am very disappointed it cannot be returned.
1,consumer,"While it's true that I LOVE this cologne, I WILL NOT pay over $200 when at it's high point was under $75. Shame on you!"
2,they didn't look like the picture,"i was so disappointed it was nothing like what they show, the rsuka-handle on all three keep coming off,they was glue on the blade was suppose to have been stainless steel,but it not, i was going to send back but i new there was going to be to much trouble,so i decide to keep thim i had to dill holes in the handle and put a ribit ,they just maid to look at .danman"
2,kelme master MX,"I previously owned the real kelme masters and decided to try the ""fakes"". These are made of regular leather so they require a lot of break-in. These shoes gave me blisters worse than any other shoe I've had.It is worth it to spend the extra money on the real masters. I HIGHLY RECOMEND THE MASTERS MADE WITH KANGAROO LEATHER INSTEAD!!"
4,One glaring problem--if you're a record junkie...,"1500+ pages. Yikes, it's GIGANTIC! Exhaustive, almost three inches thick. Absolutely invaluable. However, one glaring omission: no record release numbers. If you want to use this volume as a discography source, that is an obstacle. I suggest, as companions to this reference, two books by Paul Gambaccini, Tim Rice, and Jonathan Rice, BRITISH HIT SINGLES (I have the 8th edition, c. 1991), and BRITISH HIT ALBUMS (1992). These two works will help fill in the record release numbers, should you want/need to look up a specific record release questing for artists and/or titles."
1,"CRAP, DON'T BUY IT WHATEVER YOU DO!!","This book sux, i'm not even joking, its crap. All the info is bs, and you can find more out about everything on the internet, with (gasp) Color pictures!?! This book has black and white pics...and not very many of them, if i could give this book absolutely no stars at all i would. ITS CRAP!! DON'T WASTE YOU'RE MONEY!!"
3,not bad,"this book wasnt bad, because its one of the only books on the OC and so a lot of oc fans like me get it. its a fun read, especially if you're as obsessed with the show as i am. (however, summer is so not 5'4"" like the book says!)"
1,Most of this stuff isnt even true!,"This book is lame! If you are going to write a book about Orange County (excuse me, the OC) then you should at least get the facts straight...I have lived in the OC all my life, and this book gave me a great laugh because it was wrong on SO many levels! People who actually live here are making fun of this book like crazy because it is SO lame."
5,psychic visions,"Ellie has psychic visions of the crimes committed in the past and of danger looming in the future. Now her visions take her into the woods and a girl buried there - a girl that has been missing for 2 years. Can her 6th sense help her find the murderer? In addition Ellie is befriended by an older guy who seems to know too much about her.This is a great Fear Street novel. Psychic visions, scary premonitions, confusion about what's real, what's not to like in this book? Recommended for any Stine fan and fans of series like ""Medium"" as well. (As long as they are okay with this book being a YA novel.)"
5,suspenseful and fast paced read,"r.l stine is one of my favorite authors, and ive always enjoyed reading his books. this book was spine chilling and suspensful. hard to put the book down once i started reading, kept me on edge, which is the kind of reading i enjoy most. once again, r.l stine has impressed me with his brilliant work."
3,"semi-good, mostly wierd and bad","well my title speaks for my thought about the book. It wasn't realy good. Nothing scary, very wierd, but there was a small twist. Lowly recommended"
5,Jones-ing for kibble after a session with these,"Ratherbee catnip products are the best on the market,and the NipStix are probably the best of all their creations. The NipStix are potent, sturdy, and last for months. My cats are still abusing and bunny kicking the three I purchased seven months ago.NipStix are very similar to the Ratherbee catnip cigars, but without the scatalogic appearance (see my review for the cigars). They make excellent presents and stocking stuffers for the kitties in your life."
1,My cat did not like this,"I purchased a Ratherbee's catnip toy that looked exactly like this one at a gift shop in Myrtle Beach. My cats loved and played with it so much the catnip inside turned to dust & the toy completely deflated. This one, they batted around a few times and that was it !. In a few days the new one looked just the old one that had lasted 2 years !!!!. This one is flat & without catnip smell, apparently. My only quess is that it was a very old product and the catnip was dried to the point that is was almost dust & all the smell was gone. I would not buy from this dealer agsin. Daisy HOdges & from my cats Dewey & Ruben, YUCK !"
3,Decent follow-up,"This is a typical chase novel where no one can be trusted and the group is fighting to maintain solidarity. And in classic book 2 of 3 style, the group has jumped from the frying pan into the fire. The characters are more static than they were in Dark Power. However, that they are able to rely on themselves and not feel the need to run to grownups every time they feel stressed adds to their credibility."
2,Mis-advertised.,"I wouldn't know how this product works as i never used it. It doesn't have an AGP slot as advertised, only PCIE X16. I returned it for a full refund."
5,THE BEST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!*****,PEOPLE YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE ME THIS IS THE BEST CD EVER!!!!!This cd has wonderful heart warming songs all of them are in spanish perfect if you want to learn spanish or if you just like Selena perfect for a collection. I personally listen to tis cd everyday . I think its better than the Selena Dreaming of You cd. buy it you wont regret it...this cd is 100% better...BUY IT or borrow it frow someone
5,Watch for the song No Me Queda Mas,"By far the highlight of the album is the song, No me queda mas. I used to play it for my students while teaching in Albania. We had a lesson where each student had to bring a song, we would listen to it, and we would explain the personal significance it had for us. The song brings gentleness to my heart, the sweetness that was Selena, the simple and adorned style she sometimes could do so well. Perhaps what impresses me the most about Selena is the amazing variety of styles she could sing in. My only wish she could have sung more songs like the beautiful Lo Me queda mas."
1,WHERE'S MY ORDER?,"It has been exactly one month since I have ordered the Selena CD, Amor Prohibido, and I still have not gotten it. I'm very disappointed and I will tell everyone I know (That uses amazon) to NEVER buy from you."
1,not wroth it,"unless your professor is definitely testing you on chapters in this text, it's not worth buying. I bought it for a nutrition lab and ended up reading only one or two chapters."
3,"Great photo book, low academic value","Photos were greatHistory was disappointing, especially the part describing how SP came to be a large empire. Perhaps no one knows, but the author shouldn't have skipped over it by saying it was ""too difficult to trace"". The book in the same series about the Pennsylvania and the New York Central was much better from a historical standpoint.I bought this book expecting to understand how SP came to be; admittedly I know a little more about the PRR being based in the East Coast, but this book left me more confused than I started.Nonetheless, I am glad to see that people are continuing to write about railroads of yesteryear."
2,"Gotta' be Kiddin""!!","First, the voice: Sounds like Buffy ST. Marie meets an old Jersey Boy. Next, the music: Redundant and repetitive in style. Heard these chord changes a million times, but in better songs. The rhythm section is just OK. Very pedestrian and without imagination. A better drummer and bass player would have helped. I wanted to like it because a friend said that she liked it but I found it too difficult to listen to. Sorry. I would have given it only one star but that is usually reserved for diesel engines."
3,disappointing -- mediocre at best,"Despite the juicy plot summary and book jacket, this book is not very special. If you want a really good Cuban book, try The Lonely Crossing of Juan Cabrera, a real classic. This book aspires to greatness but does little more than catch a bit of the mood of Cuba of a different era. The relationships are not well developed, the plot is a mish-mash of convoluted events and the writing is uneven. I'm not trying to pick on the author, but for the big hardcover release this book has, one would expect it be have some more literary qualities. The writing is mediocre at best. Even an interesting relationship like the one with the narrator's friend Paula is not well developed. An okay first effort, but she has a ways to go before reaching her groove."
2,Picture does not match product,"I was really excited to get these earrings in. But disappointed when I opened the package. The shape was similar, but earring hook was much different. The tail of the hook was longer than the front so it would hang lower and looked strange.I was hoping it had just been a mix up, and I would get the right one sent to me, but now I'm returning them and hoping Gem Avenue will make sure they properly display the product they will be sending you.** Don't think this review is all bad though. I also ordered the Irish Claddagh ring for a friend for her birthday and it was perfect. As well as a necklace for a pendant for myself and so far it has held up really well. ** I'll be ordering again, I will just be more leery about the pictures matching and such."
5,Pilates and Yoga Review,"The book is exactly what I wanted- I had it a few years ago and used it often, then moved a few times and it was lost in the shuffle. The pictures are detailed and the explanations are thorough, including beginner moves to more advanced positions. I like how it groups positions by category and muscle groups, so that you can put together different workouts that work for you, at your own pace and with a level of difficulty that suits you. It is excellent and I wouldn't hesitate to buy this book a third time, either as a gift or if I lose it again (I have a lot of books, so sometimes I'll ""lose"" one and find it a year later- which is probably what will happen now that I've bought this again). I received my book within a week of ordering it, and it was in great condition, so no complaints there either."
2,"Nice 70's prog, but horrible singing.","This could have been one of the all time great prog-rock albums from the 70's Spanish scene, as it pulls out all the stops. The music is heavy prog, with complex keyboard and guitar tapestries, and very engaging arrangements. The problem with this album though is that the singing is absolutely horrid! The ""singer"" sings so flat in places that it makes it very difficult to even listen to. It really bewilders me as to why this group of obviously talented musicians found these vocals to be acceptable. All I can say is ""what a pity"". Get it if you think you can look beyond the singing, because there is some really good prog rock stuff going on here. Also, this is more Anglo-influenced prog rock, rather than the flamenco-influenced, or Basque stuff that most people associate the Spanish prog scene with."
5,Great gloves,"These gloves are really wonderful and I have a pair in green as well as blue. I use these for driving my miniature horses and doing other barn work. They hold up great, are correctly sized and very comfortable"
2,Not Happy,"Ordered the children's size gloves for my 8 yr. old daughter. No size indicated on website other than children's size. When I got them it was marked children's size 4-6. Way too small. Next size would be a ladies small, which would be way too big. Ended up returning item on 1/24/11. As of 3/3/11 the refund has not hit my credit card.Also, much thinner than I would have thought. All weather? I think in winter it would not provide enough warmth."
1,I'm sure this program would be great... if I could actually use it!,"Sadly, no such luck for me. I've spent HOURS with customer service (which, by the way, is ONLY available during work hours!!) to no avail. Guess that's a few hundred dollars down the drain.Don't buy this program."
1,Oh dear...,"Does not follow the book in the least. If it's supposed to be made from a classic story the least that could have been going on is trying to follow the book at least a little bit closer. Don't buy this. If I could give it zero stars, I would.I bet Emily Bronte is rolling over in her grave! Poor thing. I would too."
1,just plain bad,"MTV turned this story into nothing more than your average teeny bopper drama, which is probably fine if you are a teeny bopper. Otherwise, get the REAL movie."
2,Really pretty lackluster,"If you're a fan of any of the traditionally-told Wuthering movies, you might think an update for the story is an interesting idea. And it might be. Sadly, this attempt is so poorly written and revamped so greatly that it becomes a bland mashup of the original material and whatever was popular on MTV circa 1993. Most offensive...well, it would be a tie between the oversimplified and overly dramatic dialogue, (""If you left me I would kill you!"" ""I don't know who my parents are, I don't know!!!"") and the mediocre music which has been forced uncomfortably into the storyline. Even if you stripped away the name and pretended it had nothing to do with Wuthering Heights (easy enough to do), it's still pretty pointless and painful to watch."
1,I want my wasted 2 hours back!,"As usual when updating a classic, everything gets all screwed up. MTV assassinates another classic. The characters are cold, overly melodramatic and basically not very interesting. I had high hopes since I really liked Erika Christensen and thought she was quite talented. She is about the only likable character in the movie and she still was vain and shallow. John Doe (from the band X) is wasted here, but luckily gets to bow out early and probably wished he was billed as Bob Smith instead. The rest of the cast is so extremely spoiled and unlikeable you just wish they'd all die off soon after Doe does. An absolute waste of good filmstock. I wish I could describe it more but it put me to sleep so often I had to watch it 3 times just to put the lame excuse of a story together. No stars!!"
3,Pretty Good,"Overall a really nice movie, not as good as the original but still nice. There are a lot of differences and left out information in this version."
2,"Neat Concept, Poor Writing and Acting","I thought I would enjoy this more than I did...I like musicals, I like Wuthering Heights, I was a teenager around the time this was made. But, the bad acting and even worse writing really brought the whole thing down. I think it was neat conceptually, but there is just no way around the fact that it's a bad B-movie. The ""I am Heath(cliff)"" speech is especially disappointing. It's truncated and poorly acted. The characters lack depth and aren't very realistic and the plot often lurches forward with no reason behind the characters actions. I had a hard time sitting through it until the end."
3,Hard to find movie,"I was excited to find this movie on Amazon, I had been having a hard time finding it. I love this movie. The only problem I have with this video is that it is a bit shaky like the tracking is off. But then again, who buys VHS? It's still viewable and I love this movie."
3,Too over dramatic for an already dramatic story,"If you have seen the preview for this movie just know that it is better than the actual movie. Of course Mike Vogel is nice to look at but he is just placed in a sadly dramatic story where it's hard to like a single character. Everyone's acting is either cheesy or over dramatic and a LOT is cut out and/or changed from the original for no apparent reason. The end is THE DUMBEST/WEIRDEST thin you will ever see and the whole trying to make it modern PLUS a musical thing is just over kill. The reason I bought this is because I was misled by the preview into thinking that I was going to see a powerful, dramatic, romance...not! Also, knowing the classic by heart probably didn't help me like this version either. I would suggest seeing it just for the sake of judging it and if you do decide to see it, just know what you're getting yourself into and don't expect much."
3,Pretty good,"This movie was ok for being a tv movie. If you're expecting it to be like the book it's really nothing like it except for a few similarities but it does have a good story. And especially buy it if you like mike vogel. Overall I wouldn't watch it and be bored, but I wouldn't say it's my favorite movie either."
5,Action Jacket is great,"The Action Jacket works perfectly with my Inno. I use it at the gym and when travelling. The buttons are easy to get to, and I do not worry about the Inno falling."
1,Did not work for me,Hoped this would work on my severe itchy scalp condition but did not work. Liked the convenient roll on so it was easy to apply but did not stop itch. Also there was very little in the container and it ran out pretty quickly.
1,Expensive Card Board,"The Sides are Cardboard the Top is cardboard the bottom is cardboard, the slots are cardboard. Would not buy again, dont think it will last very long. I would pay $15 tops for this item."
1,Bad,"I thought this sorter was absolutely horrible. I ordered it for my classroom, and first it took 2 weeks after the scheduled delivery date to get to me. Then when it came, it was all cardboard. It was deceiving because the picture made it look so nice. However, it was a pain to put together, and took two people to put it together. Plus, while I was putting it together, some of the cardboard bent. Overall, it was a disappointing purchase, because of the description and the picture. I would not buy this again in the future."
2,This may disappoint,"I purchased this based on price and the picture alone, thinking it was a great buy from reaserch I've done. Looking at pics allover the internet (everyone had the same pic) it looked pretty solid. Alas when I recieved the package I was very disappointed. The organizer is 100% card board with a metal wire frame suport for the back and plastic clips for the face labeling edges. I guess if this is for personal use it may serve its function but for business use it looks kind of tacky and feels very flimsy....."
3,not bad,"bought this to use as student mailboxes in my 1st grade class. held up pretty well all year. i bought a second one to use to store my copy paper, books, other heavier things and it got a bit bent. had to bring it home over summer since i was moving schools and it completely fell apart with all the lifting and moving around. think its a bit expensive as well since its only cardboard."
4,Good Buy,"This is ideal for home office use and easy to put together, it keeps all literature organized and easy access. Plus it is cheaper than buying wood and looks pretty good considering the price. I've bought this brand several times in the past and never disappoints!"
4,The Fellowes Sorter,I am enjoying using this in my classroom at school. It really fits my purpose for keeping the students organized and on task. It is sturdy enough for its use and I am glad that I purchased it.
1,after ducktaping the item,I purchased 2 of these. 1 of them i had to ducktape together due to the damage the sorter was in when it arrived. the 2nd item had to be returned. i only had the shelves in the box nothing else. I have ordered several things from Amazon and have been pleased until this order. I hope this was a one time thing. I just mailed it back and i am hoping to get a refund with no problem. We will see!
4,jumping good!,"I bought this because it folded over and thought I could hide it from view when not in use but what i found out is it is not easy to do.In order to fold it up, you have to take the legs off first and I don't want to spend the time doing that. It would have been nice if it could have just been folded immediately however, the quality of this product is supurb. It is very sturdy and I believe it is very safe unlike other products which eventually rip. It's too soon to say if this will be the fate of this one as well but I'll let you know. At this point, I would buy it again because of its sturdiness. I also like it's size and have no complaints except for the difficulty in folding it up."
2,An fancy looking hotplate for mom's casserole,"Geez steve, wtf?! No looping function?! Choppy playback for large files?! Pain in the rear to update the playlist from Itunes. Might be great for people sitting at home that are boycotting cable pay per view or someone that wants to watch youtube all day. For any serious professional or corporate use, this thing is worthless. Like anything apple, wait for the third generation, maybe they'll get it all figured out by then.I still can't believe there is no looping function, my walkman back in the eighties had a looping function. Big dissapointment."
4,Not enough features.,Good product. Runs very warm. It's primarily so that Apple can sell you stuff. Since that's the case it should be alot cheaper.
1,if your not an ipod person then this is mostly likely not for you,"I received this as a gift and find it pretty useless outside of being able to go to utube. It is great for utube but for 230.00 product it is unjustifiable to keep it for that. renting movies online is not a bad feature but again it is a bit redundant if you already have a pc or laptop attached to your tv. also the fact they charge you to watch tv programs that are free from the networks was a bit appalling. the lack of being able to browse the internet or download from other sites other than apple was a show stopper for me. If you have an ipod and want another one for your living room then this is the product for you but for the rest us,don't waste your money."
3,Harder to setup than advertised,"This is a great product, once it has been set-up. However, the set up process proved to be difficult and time consuming. Initially, we were not able to get Itunes to recognize AppleTV. We are running a firewalled Vista PC with DSL access and McAfee anti-virus. The included instructions are quite minimal (generally just suggesting plug it in and play it). However, we needed to spend significant time looking at the Apple Product Support Website to find a solution and ultimately ended up opening ports in the firewall. Not everyone may feel comfortable doing this. Ultimately, after opening up the ports, it still didn't work. What finally did the trick was unplugging Apple TV and starting the whole process over again."
5,Great choice.Buy it now!,That's really a great productas everything from AppleThe only problem is that you can't easily use it outside the US but if you are clever enough you can buy from different shops gift cards from online stores that they ship outside united states so you can make like I did:Register an account on itunes redeeming a gift card for Itunes store in USA so you can download filmsGreat choice for cocooning and Save films on hard discperfect quallity HD and great collection of any kind of filmsHighly recommended(buy also an applecare protection plan for apple TV)Amazin have great prices for applecare check it outi got mine with only $10
2,Buggy,"I should have listened to some of the negative reviews here. I get more freezes requiring hard resets than a Windows 95 pc. Except it doesn't even have a power button - i have to unplug it every time this happens. Now it stopped working altogether (after less than 6 months of sporadic use). I will have to send it in to Apple.I am a happy mac user otherwise, and i expect an Apple product to just work, especially an appliance-type device like this.Also, i was disappointed to find out that, opposite to what i was told in the Apple store when i bought it, rentals are being made available very late (weeks after the brick&mortar; video rental store release dates) and even then the selection is quite thin (i live in Canada).Quite a disappointment altogether."
5,Excellent product!!!!,"I own an Ipod, so buying an AppleTV seemed like a logical extension. It can do so much more than just listen to music. My kids (4 and 2) enjoy watching YouTube content with it. Let me tell you, by having access to YouTube in your living room, it unlocks a whole new world. Plus, the AppleTV also lets you watch trailers for current movies for FREE. Maybe this isn't a big deal to most people, but my kids love watching the trailers to Madagascar 2 and Bolt and all the other kids movies in theaters. In addition, the AppleTV allows you to rent movies without having to leave the house. This becomes a bigger plus when the movie is lesser-known and not stocked in the RedBox kiosk (where we normally rent movies). And the biggest advantage of AppleTV is Boxee (do a Google search). The AppleTV would be worth it if it had nothing else but Boxee.Overall I am very pleased with this device, and have recommended it to others."
1,Port 3689 problems that Apple will not address,"I have had this Apple TV since it first came out and paid almost $400 for it. It worked great until iTunes software updates around the 7.2 something... anyhow, after that update people have been having problems with the port settings. You call Apple and they read from queue cards and have no idea what they are doing. They always blame someone or something else, like your router (I also use an Apple Airport router, which i bought because i was told by Apple it was my router and buying theirs would fix my Apple TV problem...NOPE) Don't get me wrong, I love Apple products and I am amazed at the BUGS in this product. There are many folks with the same issues...just go to google and type in ""apple tv port 3689"" enjoy the reading. I am going to ebay this piece of junk, so look for it there if you want it."
5,Great buy,I bought one over a year ago at a higher price. One of my relatives had it at their house and thought it would be a great place for all of our photos and music. We loved it so much we bought another now that the price is even lower. Still trying to figure out the best way to store our home movies on it. We have put on some of our favorite movies which is really convienent. Very happy with the purchase both times.
4,"very nice and useful , high quality .","very nice and useful , high quality but i did like the remote control it is not useful for typing when you are try to search for some thing in youtube ."
4,WOW! Don't know how I lived without it...,I finally gave in and bought an AppleTV. Don't know why I waited so long. It is so much better than I expected. I love it! I can watch TV from iTunes and my favorite part is the ability to watch my MobileMe movies on my TV!!!
4,"Reliable, but movie selection is limited.","Setup took a while, downloading of iTunes library and my photos taking the most time. I've only had to reboot it once due to hanging up. Itunes movie rental library is limited. Video podcasts are great, many are higher quality than those that I download on my TiVo series 2. I also enjoy the screen saver feature with my digital photos flowing while I'm playing songs from my iTunes library."
3,"does what it says it will do, but nothing more.","This is a good product and it does exactly what Apple says it will do. The setup, like all Apple products, is a breeze. I just wish it would do more, like hooking up with Hulu, Netflix instant play, and Amazon video streaming. I can watch Netflix instant-play on my iPad, but not thru Apple TV. UPDATE: Just rented ""Green Zone"" for $3.99 via Apple TV and iTunes. I am disappointed in the picture and sound quality. It's not as good as a standard DVD, and of course, not even close to Blu-Ray. However, I downloaded a free HD video from iTunes, and the quality was just as good as a blu-ray DVD."
3,i was hoping more,"I thought that i was able to stream Amazon and Netflix movies and TV shows via this product but i was wrong, if i've known i would have purchased the mac mini instead. I doubt it if Amazon will let me exchange this to the mini.But i won't be satisfied until Amazon and Netflix allows streaming their shows to the apple tv, otherwise this is not a total waste."
4,An interesting addition to the home theater,"Originally bought the ATV in an attempt to clear space on my computer due to all the TV shows I had downloaded, but quickly realized that this was not the case. The ATV is not an external hard drive, and must sync with an iTunes library much like an iPod (though you are able to purchase shows through the ATV iTunes store, they will also download onto your main library).That being said,after purchasing an actual external hard drive, creating an iTunes library on it, an syncing the ATV, it has proven to be a valuable addition to our home theater. Television shows are available for download pretty soon after the season has ended, much sooner than waiting for the DVD/Blu-ray release (and sometimes quite a bit cheaper).In the end, this is a quality product, certainly worth the price, but have a large hard drive available."
5,Great Interface,"Have had one for years, a-la-carte interface for buying and renting movies that we love to use. Picture and audio quality are great, has component video and analog audio outputs as well as optical and hdmi for connection flexibility."
1,missing feature non starter,Does not have a IR emitter for controlling your other components. Should be able to turn on off amp.
2,Disappointment - Switched to Roku,"I tried this out after a friend recommended it, but it is a very limited unit with many flaws. For example, if you really like HD, you will quickly notice that this unit can't display movies in 1080p. I did like the iTunes integration for music, but, let's be honest, I bought this unit to watch movies and it doesn't excel there. Everything is just too focused on iTunes. I would have liked to see Hulu Plus, but it seems that you have to hack your Apple TV to get that to work. So, I quickly returned it and go myself a Roku. Great decision! Video quality is better and there are many more sources right from the beginning. They also say that Hulu Plus will be available next months. Anyhow, I love my Apple laptop and I like my iPhone, but this is not a winner. Better luck next time Apple!"
2,Get this if you don't have cable or satellite.,"I was very disappointed with the Apple TV. The picture quality sucks and you have to pay more for HD. It takes more than 5 minutes to start up. Best part is you can watch youtube, flickr, and listen to internet radio. Ask yourself why do you want that on your TV, viewing it on your computer is better. I don't hate Apple, I own most of the Apple products but this is a rotten Apple, lol. Get this product if you don't have Cable/Satellite or have a collection of movies you burned or purchased then you will get the most out of this product."
2,deception,"bon produit, livree tel quel, neuf, le seul hick il s'agit de la premiere version et ne peut etre upgrader pour le system airplay de ipad.. il doit passe par le wi-fi et par votre ordi pour avoir tout, il ne se branche pas a votre reseau maison pour naviguer sur vos ordi maison ayant des films, il ne passe que par itunes. mais heureusement cette version est facilement hackable"
1,"Slow, unreliable and not ready for prime time","I've had a 160 GB Apple TV for a year now and have a real love-hate relationship with it. Unfortunately, after a year, the hate is winning out. I've used macs for years and am savvy with OS X so you'd think this would be pretty easy for me to deal with the problems related to the Apple TV. Sometimes, yes. But even after a year with this product I am confounded by how itunes ""loses"" it, how I have to reconnect (and reload all the data onto it) and how much time this sucks away from my life. And I'm not even beginning to mention the fact that if things go as the RIAA and others would like them to, the only ""legal"" content you can put on one of these things is what you buy in digital format outright. Thus, no converting legally purchased movies to AppleTV (or ipod/iphone) formats lest you risk being labeled a criminal by corporate america.This machine is a waste of money and Apple needs to give everyone who bought it there money back."
4,"love it for photos, music and internet radio",i purchased my first apple tv a few years ago and love it for showing my digital pictures on my hdtvit is also great for playing my itunes library.recently i discovered i can enter the url of my favorite radio stations. this is a feature i use a lot while displaying a slideshow of my photos. i gave several as cristmas gifts this year. everyone is enjoying them.i wish it ran cooler though.
2,Nothing of any interest to true seekers.,"The title pretty much says it all. This book gives information on Astrology, Moon Signs, and plenty of other nonsense. The Palmistry might be interesting, but buying this book for just that portion would be a waste of time and money."
4,The Sequel to Freaky Friday,"Although it is not as good as Freaky Friday, I enjoyed Summer Switch. The plot is basically the same - parent and child switch bodies, but the narration is different. Instead of just one person telling the story, Summer Switch swaps back and forth between the two. Please do not think this a carbon copy of Freaky Friday. It is realy a funny book in its own right."
3,1950's version of the future,"Interesting and worth a look, but beware this vision of the future lacks even passing reference to nanotechnology, and biotechnology and only passing reference to artificial intelligence and robotics. It is ironic and odd that he insists on having ""no opinion only facts"" and then proceeds to spout only opinions and ignore facts. For a more fact based (but still imperfect) idea of the future look up Ray Kurzweil."
1,Bordering on ludicrous,"This film gives a very one-sided view of inventor and futurist Jacque Fresco. There is no objectivity, not a word from critics or even anyone who seriously questions his ideas."
3,should have been better packaged,"cool idea but the item was poorly packaged and the cover of the set was stained with spices that had leaked out of their containers. Since this is a food item, it should have been completely sealed and not only were the individual spice containers not sealed, but the box came in a non-sealed plastic bag. Also, the kit was a bit smaller than I was anticipating (I guess not entirely a bad thing) AND the ratio of mixed spices (like ""italian seasoning"", ""mexican seasoning"", etc) to pure spices was a little dissapointing - I would have liked to get more pure spices."
5,Evensong AND Vespers,"After I bought this CD, I was surprised to find that just over half of it is Catholic Vespers, with lots of chanting. In fact, the first several tracks are just the men chanting. It's quite good, but not what fans of Kings often expect. But then when the full choir finally comes in, it's dramatic and beautiful, for lack of better words. And I doubt any words are adequate.The other half is good Anglican Choral Evensong for Advent. That's actually what I expected the whole CD to be.But you know what's funny? This Anglican has come to like the Vespers part better. I've actually gotten hooked on it. It's that good. I've listened to a lot of choral music, but have never heard anything quite like it.The Vespers alone make this CD a must-get for choral church music fans."
5,A Double Genius,Gordon Lish's clear voice rings through the sea of mediocrity in today's fiction.He has no equals or imitators. He will tie your emotions in a knot and set you free.
5,"A CLown? Yeah, like Chaplin","Lish's Lulu stories reviewed here got him called a clown. Yes, like Chollie Chaplin, Buster Keaton, Sam Beckett. Lish's stuff has to be read as poetry is, for implications, with side vision, with one's intuition. Read Lish's stories the way Roethke reads the world: ""I learn by going where there is to go,"" he says. Lish uses his IMAGINATION, fergodssakes, not this earth and its things. Lish shows again in this collection that he is one of our finest standup (at-the-keyboard) comics, and comedy is always a most serious event. There is no one like him, except for Beckett at his best, mostly in his plays. Those who cannot read Lish, cannot understand him, simply haven't kept up with the direction of literature and probably don't like Beckett, Amy Hempel, Don Barthleme, John Barth.... I keep Lish's books among all those books I love and will be buried with.John Herrmann, Libby, Montana, author of (in Aug.2001) MURDER AT THE RED DOG."
5,Bike MAP Holder Case,"I bought ab extra one and gave to a friend. Works great and was just what I was looking for. Thanks Amazon for your dependable service and providing the product that always meets or exceeds expectations. Thanks,"
5,Great Basketball Series with a touch of Romance!,"I would have to say that Hoop days is a great series for the price. The characters are interesting and the plot is straight foreward. The animation quality can get poor at times, but I am not complaining as for the most part I was pleased with this purchase. I like the little bits of romance in there series but it was never overdone, overall it was perfect. The dub was okay, not outstanding work, but most of the characters voices worked out well; the only few I had a problem with were when older men were cast for the voices of teenagers; that just did not suit the characters. Bottom line this series is mainly just fun and entertaining, something to kick back and watch."
4,Hoop Days: The Complete Collection,Enjoyable anime to watch for a great price.Good story nice character development and great designs. I was pulled into the story and wish the anime was a little longer if youlike basket ball and anime give it a shot.
3,Duke forgot L.A.,"Perhaps there sould have been two books: The Few & Chosen Brooklyn Dodgers and The Few & Chosen Los Angeles Dodgers. The Duke of Flatbush has basically wrote about the former. Did he forget the Dodgers moved to L.A. back in '57? Which is funny because he went with them and he is from SoCal. There are some glaring ommisions to Duke's top five lists for each position from not selecting more deserving LA Dodgers. How Steve Sax (2nd base), Eric Karros (first base), Mike Scioscia (catcher), Jim Brewer and Mike Marshall (relief pitcher) and especially Orel Hershiser and Don Sutton (right handed pitcher) are not included in Edwin Donald's rankings is beyond me. His Brooklyn memories are wonderful, but he needs some guidance evaluating LA Dodgers as the Dodgers have now been in Los Angeles (50 years) almost as long as they were in Brooklyn (67)."
1,Not Worth a Dime,There isn't enough information on snakes in this book to fill a thimble. Save your money and buy something else.
5,"A fresh, imaginative look at soy, beautifully presented.","Lorna Sass continues to delight her fans. The New Soy Cookbook is chock full of deliciously unexpected uses for a variety of soy products. Of particular interest are the seafood recipes. The Shrimps, Mussels and Tofu in Lemongrass-Miso Broth recipe is outstanding. Ms. Sass has definitely taken a whole new look at soy. The entire format of the book is bold, exciting and most inviting."
5,A Fantastic Soy/Asian style cook book,I bought this book hoping I would find new ways to incorperate soy foods into my diet with simple recipies and I did. I also found fantastic examples of asian style cooking which I also love! This is a wonderful book. I am lucky enough to live near 3 great asian markets with helpful owners that show me the way through finding some of the ingedients but most of them can be found in a regular grocery store. I have never bothered to write a review for a book before but this one compelled me. Buy it!
5,Polarfleecevpizzazz,"This is a great book, the patterns were great to follow. Would recommend to anyone who is interested in sewing fleece material."
4,Taught myself dutch,"I got this book about a month ago because I'm going to spend the summer in the Netherlands as an exchange student. The units are very easy to understand, most things are explained very clearly. There are things though where I wish I had a teacher to ask a question. I definatley reccoments that you GET THE TAPE. I had the book without the tape first, it's really needed for pronunciation. The lessons are based on a theme and give some basic grammer. However there's only a few pages as a dictionary in the back so I'd buy one seperatley. Good Luck!"
3,"Good method, but confusing on occassion","This learn dutch book shared a method which seemed to work for me with other books, however, pronunciation guides and word lists were poorly chosen. But if you're tuned into phoenetics, then this would be a good learn dutch book."
4,Good update,"The tables I use most often seem to have the same data, but nice to have an update after several years."
2,Save your money!!,I have read the other reviews and I hate to say it but the book wasn't all of that. I had read the Orchid Hunter first which was so good so I decided to read this one. Bad mistake! To me the story was difficult to get into and plus I started to hate the main character Raine. Here is why a woman character should not have to show her booby to get the enemy ask Lara Croft!! This disgusted me and showed me this character had no class. If you want to read a great book with adventure and with a great heroine who does not stoop to showing off her body parts then get The Orchid Hunter!!! A great woman character uses her brains and sometimes maybe weapons but never by flopping her boobs out.
2,Hard to tell time on this timepiece,"I have had this watch about a month, and while the watch is beautiful and its various functions work very well, It most basic function, telling time does not. At least not for older eyes.Specifically, the minute hand is much too narrow and hard to see. It can often be obscured by the red chrono hand, or it often blend into the white face or the gold tone chrono dials. If you need reading glasses, you will most likely not be able to tell where the minute hand is without them, and therefore npot be able to tell what time it is! If your reading glass magnigication is over 2.00 you may not be able to find the minute hand even with your reading glasses on! Even bright sunlight doesn't help this problem due to reflections.Perhaps the blue or black dial versions of this watch are easier to read, but the gold edges of the minute hand and the glow in the dark center of the minute hand contribute to its being very hard to find on the white dial version of the watch."
2,Could be great-lacks much,"This book could be good. The topic is an important one, one that faces many different people. The content however was very dissapointing. This book contains a lot of repetivness.. and not much but the same facts stated over and over.. I was very dissapointed."
2,Get the book - skip the video...,"Hi guys,Got the video. As usual, Andy does a great job at getting all the right notes, etc. I like him and his Charlie sound is pretty good though I think Andy is at his best in the Stevie Ray/Jimi realms.There is no tab and I sure miss it a lot. This is the last time I buy one of those DVD with no tab.Fortunatelly, Wolf Marshall does a C. Christian book/CD kick with almost the same songs. I don't have the book yet but based on the really solid job Wolf did on the Joe Pass CD/Book I am not too worried.If Wolf can do a killer job with Joe Pass it is hard to imagine how he could fail his C. Christian book.Christian was a pioneer so I still want to learn his hits. However it will be done with the book.An advantage of the book is that you can teak the channels so you can tone down the solos. This is almost as good as a rythm track. The DVD won't offer that."
4,START THROWING THOSE DARTS AT DAWN! SHE'S THE BULL'S EYE!,"I hate Dawn. She's a big mouthed brat who is hostile and uses other people. She has Ducky fetching and carrying for her and that is not fair to Ducky. He doesn't need some middle school witch telling him what to do, especially if his efforts aren't being appreciated. He is an angel and saint for putting up with her. I also disliked Jill, but then again, she was just too infantile for words. As another reviewer noted, it would be interesting to see what one of her diaries would be like. I wonder if she'd write it in crayon."
2,Dawn stinks,"I can not understand Dawn. I mean she is sooo self-absorbed. Sunny is in her most time of need and Dawn only thinks of her problems. Amalia had an abusive boyfriend, Maggie has anorexia, and Sunny's mother is dying of cancer and all Dawn can think about is herself. Why don't Dawn try listening to her friends about their problems for once and then she'll be able to accept that her life is pretty good."
3,Good but not the best,"Dawn's third Diary was okay but it had a kind of boring story line. Dawns character lacks depth and She seems so superficial. She obsesses over EVERYTHING and that makes her sound whiny and immature. What happened at the concert she went to seemed surreal and unrealistic. When Ducky drank at the concert when he knew that he had to drive himself and Dawn and everyone else home, seemed out of character for him. Ducky wouldn't be that irresponsible. Sunny and Ducky are probably the strongest characters in the series and their books are the best. But the scenes between Sunny and Dawn are sad but also touching. The book is worth reading if you enjoy the series and are interessted in finding out what happens to Sunny and her mom. Dawns 2nd Diary as well as Sunny's 1st and 2nd Diaries are the best. Amelia and Maggies as well as Ducky's are good to. Overall the series is worth reading."
1,CDS vs BSC,"I hate the California Diaries series so much!!! They are so boring. They're all so depressing! The only character I like is Jill. I wish Ann M Martin would write a diary for her because she's the only normal one. The Babysitters Club books are much better. And they DO deal with serious issues, such as anorexia, child abuse, diabetes, coping with death, and shoplifting. How can anyone say they are childish and all ""happy, life is wonderful"" etc? They DO present an optimistic attitude towards life but that's good. The CDS is depressing and BORING. Anyway, how can Dawn be doing 8th grade again? She did it in Stoneybrook. I think the CDS books are boring and immature. And they are so bleak. No wonder so many people are depressed in the world. They obviously read the CDS series. I think the BSC series is brilliant and is definitely much better than CDS!"
3,"I love the CDS, but they're so young!","smiley@iol.ie is kinda right, about 2 things: they should be older than 8th grade and it's depressing. but that's LIFE. one day it hits you on the face and your life goes haywire. younger readers should skip thie if they're not ready for a taste of the 'real world'. But remember, CD always always leave a tiny bit of hope. it may not be written in full view on the lines of their journals, but you know it as u read on. You know Dawn and Sunny will come through. You know Maggie is going to be alright. But in real life, it probably won't neccesarily work out. i didn't really like this one because nothing much happened except the concert (which took forever to get to). Plus, I'd thought Sunny and Dawn would get together whenever Sunny's mom would die. But I'm glad the book ended the way it did. That wasn't depressing was it? It had hope."

5,"Feeding the Body, Nourishing the Soul","This is an extraordinary book that changed the way I see food and its role in my life. I'm fascinated about the subject of food, nutrition, and diets, but I've never read anything like this book before. More and more, after reading it, I've been able to let go of a diet mentality, and instead, actually begin to enjoy food.Feeding the Body... is filled with incredible insights about food that most of us no longer acknowledge or are aware of. A word of warning: This book isn't a ""quick fix,"" nor is it an ""easy read."" Being able to benefit from its abundant wisdom asks that you take the time to read it carefully while considering its insights--in the same way you might mull over poetry. For me, this has been an exception read, and a wonderful food journey I will always remember."
1,misinformation ruins even the best ideas,"I have no idea why this woman chooses to use Judaism as her first example if she isn't interested in what Judaism really has to say about food. There is a lot of wrong information in that section about the order, origins, and attitudes behind Jewish dietary law. She has tried to turn Kashrut into an ethical argument for vegetarianism which it is not. This is because all of her resources are books which focus on Jewish attitudes toward vegetarianism and not on traditions of Jewish eating. In a religion which has so many specifications for how to eat meat, which animals to eat, and the intricacies of ritual slaughter ... how can she say that kashrut and vegetarianism are even related? The few pieces of Jewish traditions in eating that she featured barely grazed the surface of the importance of food in Judaism. I don't know whether to trust anything she says about other religions when she has written so much wrong information about my own."
1,This book was dreadfully boring,"I just finished reading this book. The author split the book into two parts. The first part of this book there were about 15 chapters, each dedicated to one religion or another and how each of those religions were spiritually connected to food. It was ok the first couple of chapters but by the time I finished chapter 3, I was ready to go to sleep. It had to be the most dreadfully boring book that I have EVER read. The only chapter that seemed to keep me interested from the first part of the book was the one on native americans. The second part of the book was more interesting. She spoke more of the psychology of why we have eating disorders, but I would not recommend anyone buying this book for those few chapters. This book was a complete waste of money. In a few words, it sucked."
5,great product! beautiful!,"I bought this product several years ago at a significantly cheaper price than any store! It is beautiful, and works so well. I love the way it looks, and it is very functional! I have ZERO complaints and NO buyer's remorse! I loved getting this for a steal!!"
3,BEST BOOK ON THIS SUBJECT,"The author provided a fairly balanced narrative of the Gerald's and Charlene's killing spree. I was somewhat surprised that he chose to omit the actual names of law enforcement officials because, in his opinion, they did a poor job of investigating the crimes.This is a much superior book to the another book about the murders titled ""The Sex Slave Murders"" because it is provides richer detail into the how and why of the crimes. ""Sex Slave Murders"" was written 5 years after ""Venom"" and is extremely short on facts and the psychological motives for the crimes."
5,True Crime? This Is The Best...,Gerald Armond Gallego and his young wife Charlene shocked the world with the sexual serial murders of many young women. This book captured the grizzly details of the murders and makes you wish they would've gotten more of a punishment than they did. Truly a well thought out book.
5,The best lotion EVER!!!!,"I usually don't write reviews, but I just had to for this lotion. It works SO GOOD!!! It goes on creamy smooth, dries quickly, doesn't leave me feeling greasy (which I love!) at all. My skin has never been so smooth and soft to the touch!!! It is the best lotion I have ever tried - EVER!"
5,"""Best Lotion Ever""","I never write a review on any product, but this lotion is so great I just had to write about it. I just wish it was kept on the shelves at my local stores. This lotion leaves you skin feeling so soft and smooth and it last all day long. I love it and it's the ""Best Lotion Ever""."
3,Disappointing,"The basic premise of this toy is great. My daughter LOVES following along with the DVD wearing her complete ballerina outfit. But that's where the problem is: the outfit is a piece of junk. The night of her birthday she opened it up and almost immediately put the outfit on. She danced with the DVD twice...and that's when we noticed the hole in the leotard. Explain a hole in a new outfit to a 4 yr old on her birthday. We promised to exchange it for another....got another one the next day. A piece of the tiara broke off, the decorations on the ballet slippers fell off....So just don't expect too much in quality."
4,Some good ideas,"After a slow start, Mr Wetzell offers some good ideas on beginning a disciplined program of improvement. I like the flash cards he presents, and the concept behind them is worth the price of the book. He has some other odd ways of explaining how chess players think (I never figured out what ""APROP"" was) and uses a complicated glass plus two types of liquid to illustrate how your ability changes over time. However, I plowed through these ideas and found the whole idea of flashcards very good."
2,"A couple interesting ideas, but...","This book is a little wacky. The author is clearly maniacal about his chess and a little quirky. With this kind of devotion I don't think one needs any special direction or ideas on how to improve. However, I do like the flashcard idea which has been slammed a bit in some other reviews. The reason I like it is this: this book is not about how to become a master, it is about how to become a master late in life. If you have a job, family, etc. you can't just sit down in front of a computer for 3 hours a day to do your training. If you have a handful of cards in your pocket you can keep ideas fresh when you have the five to ten minute intervals in an otherwise busy day (waiting for the train, in the elevator, at the airport, in between meetings, in a taxi, etc.). You can't just carry around a laptop for these fleeting moments.."
2,No Big Deal,"You can find equally useful information on developing a chess self-improvement program for free at various web sites. No mention is made of the use of computer programs for playing rated games, practicising one's openings, analyzing middle-games, and studying endgames. No mention is made of databases that allow quick replay of your favorite openings. Not a word about chess tutorials on tactics available online at no charge to practice combinations. This book is too pricey for the prosaic and somewhat pseudo-scientific information. Spend your limited $$$ on another title,"
1,A Silly Book...At Any Price,"Whenever an author tells me to tear up dollar bills to punish myself for my bad chess habits, I know it's time to consider tearing up his ridiculous book. The best I can say for this book is that there are plenty of worse chess books out there. I know; I've read too many of them already.I only wish that, instead of buying books like this one, I'd done something better with my money--like feeding a homeless guy, or even buying him some beer or cigarettes."
5,Excellent band with a refreshing sound,"The best way to descirbe these young men from Minneapolis is the blend the old school with the new. Their sound is fantastic! Their sound is also refreshing, unique and original. I have a 5 disc CD changer in my car, their CD remains the one I never change.I would say if you like Steely Dan, Stevie Wonder, NERD, Prince or anyone that sounds close to them, you will love these guys.You will not be dissapointed if you buy this album!"
5,Well worth the wait,"I received an advance copy of Sitting Around Keeping Score in the summer of 2003, when the album was slated to be released by Arista. After raving to everyone about what a great album it was, I was livid when the record was dropped from the release schedule. Fortunately, it has finally been released, so everyone can hear what a great group this is. I could describe the music (okay: XTC meets Steely Dan meets Todd Rundgren meets...), but better still, check out the samples on the Amazon page."
5,Great Christian Rock Band,Every song is awesome on this albumand they really know how to rockand too sing about our rock of salvationworth having too all those who are rockersfor sure.ThanksBob Smith
3,Anime Fanatic Review - Okay Anime But Nothing Great or Unique,"I'd actually give this anime a 3.5, slightly above average. It is an interesting anime, especially for a little while, but gets a bit predictable. It becomes one of those shows where the heros get themselves into trouble and eventually have to be saved by something much more powerful.It is, however, a decent show to watch but is probably not for little kids. Maybe kids over 13-15. At least I finished the anime, it kept my slight interest at the very least. Many animes just plain suck and I stop watching after 5-10 episodes. This is an entertaining anime, just not an extraordinary anime that be very memorable, especially to the average anime critic. Action scenes are just okay.Has a lot of robot action, at least 25% of the anime. If you wanna know what the anime is about go to tv.com or read amazon's summary on it. No use repeating it."
5,Wow,"It is incredible that this syrup has no carbs, calories, sugar, fat or anything!!! I am so happy with it, in fact, that I may never buy the ""real"" thing again. Thank you Walden Farms!"
5,Great syrup - Zero calories,"Very nice syrupy taste. Nice consistancy (not like water). Try it, you will like it."
5,Walden Syrup,"This syrup is wonderful, I am a diabetic and would recommend this! It is much thicker then the syrups in the store."
2,Not too bad. But not great,"I went low carb about 7 months ago. I tried to do it at once and bought all sorts of low-sugar products to replace previous staples in my diet. I tried to use several things like this and convince myself it was ok.I went on and off the wagon for about 3 months until I slowly altered my diet. Now I eat super low carb and don't miss the old things. It is really more about changing your behaviors than changing your foods. I do cheat here and there. But when I do, I do it with the real thing and not some yucky imitation.If you are desperate for some low sugar syrup, this will suffice. But it really isn't enjoyable. The jam by the same company is a bit better."
1,Uh...,...Has no one mentioned this has the aftertaste of licking a foot? I'd rather go with Joseph's and fart for 12 hours.
3,just OK,"The thermal aspect of this carafe is fine -- it satisfactorily keeps hot drinks hot. My issue is with the lid. The screw-on top is absurdly difficult to close. Each time I use the item, there is a struggle to line up the threads correctly. Then, after pouring the first cup, a screech sound emerges when the button is pressed to pour; as the pot is emptied, the sound gets louder and more annoying."
5,Awesome,"I'm Persian and my family drinks tea like no one's business. We literally have tea ready 24/7.We fill one of these up with boiling water and the other with heavily steeped tea in boiling water and pour a mix of the two to our taste.My family has gone through a lot of various thermal carafes and these are our favorite. Cost is cheap, quality is great, and they hold the heat for a very very long time. 8+ hours and the tea is still hot enough.The lid can be tricky, but once you figure out that if you start to twist it on in the backwards position, it always lines up properly."
3,"great carafe, but the sticker brand stickers were an enormous pain to remove!","I am happy with the carafe. It kept coffee warm for over a day! My low vote is mainly because there was of this ""thermos"" sticker that I literally spent probably an hour removing from the beautiful steal surface. I wanted to throw it!"
2,Not as good as I thought it would be,"After messing with the top and finally getting it on the right way, I poured my hot coffee in there and 2 hours later it was just luke warm. I am very disapointed in the way this does not keep coffee hot. I am back to using my old one that keeps coffee hot until the next day. Going to look for one like my old one. I just thought that this one would be good because it was a Thermos Brand and found out not all name brands are good."
2,Not what I expected,This book was purchased to aid in recovery from open heart surgery. There is little practical advice for the first weeks of recovery. The rest of it was either for patients who had a heart attack or was general information for heart health.
2,Doesn't live up to her other work,"This book seems superficial and thin -- especially compared Godwin's other work. Doesn't seem like it's even by the same author as Evensong and Unfinished Desires, which are terrific. This just doesn't live up to her better work."
4,engaging!,"I found this book, like others Godwin has written, thoroughly engaging. However, I have two complaints, neither of them about Godwin:First, the Joyce Carol Oates blurb on the dust cover: don't read it before reading the book. It anticipates the ending.Second, reviewers who tell the book's story in their reviews. That's not the reviewer's job; it is unfair to the author and potential readersl"
2,Hard to like main character and little plot,"I really like Gail Godwin and have enjoyed many of her books. I grabbed this one off the shelf in my local library and expected an enjoyable and sensitive book. Unfortunately it was not the case. In addition to the lack of plot and flat narrative, I just didn't like Emma and couldn't figure out what about her was supposed to be interesting. She seemed to just walk through life, expecting to be famous, resenting not being important (she wasn't) and having as affair with a married man with no qualms. The setting and time period had such potential but it was not fulfilled in this book. Most disappointing."
1,Major disappointment from a favorite writer,"I had eagerly awaited the latest from a writer who has been among my favorites for more than 20 years. What disappointment this unironic, nostalgic treatment of a smarty-pants, self-absorbed, ambitious 22-year-old is! Despite glimmers of Godwin's trademark powers of oberservation and characterization, it is a trial for any adult to hang with this self-centered adolescent character whom the author, perhaps through the glow of hindsight from old age, finds as interesting as Emma Gant finds herself."
2,Who really wrote this novel?,"I still cannot believe it's Gail Godwin writing this novel. It seemed as if it were written by someone else in the 1950's and then updated with uncensored language. The main character was too well adjusted and independent given her history of abuse by her stepfather. This abuse did not stop her from having a guilt-free affair with a much older man. I can understand that she needed to be aggressive but she was sometimes too savvy for her age and then too naive based on her background. It was difficult to finish, a disappointment for me."
2,The book had lots of potential,"I so anticipated reading this new noval by Gail Godwin but was thoroughly disappointed. As several of the other reviewers mentioned, the book just ended all of a sudden. The plots were starting to get interesting and could have been developed so much further, but it seemed like Godwin just got tired of writing and that was that."
2,A Miami soap opera,"This is a story of a self-absorbed, not-interesting-enough, young woman trying to make it as a writer in Miami in the 50s. Her affair with a married man is a cliche. Her interaction with the Cuban community, in the early days of the Castro regime, would have made a far more interesting book is it had been more of a focus of the novel. Writing is OK for pop fiction, but not outstanding."
2,Disappointed,"As a contemporary of Gail Godwin, I've been a fan for many years and was looking forward to this new novel. While I'm three-fourths of the way through and intend to finish the book, I'll be glad when I do so I can go on to something else. For me, there was nothing there!Obviously, it's autobiographical, and I'm sure when I read Ms. Godwin's new journal just published, I'll see more connections. However, as a person who reads simply for pleasure and, yes, escape, I failed to appreciate anything about the book. Perhaps it was the contrast with Joyce Carol Oates' ""Missing Mom"" which I read recently and enjoyed so much (even though it didn't get the greatest of reviews).I guess I'll have to go back to Ms. Godwin's earlier novels that I remember as being wonderful and see what the difference could be. In a nutshell: if you must read the book, get it from the library."
3,Not Gail Godwin's best.....,"I've been a fan of Gail Godwin's for many years, particularly, her ""Southern Family"" novel which I hope to re-read some day and have kept in my library...This new novel, which I had approached with great hopefulness, didn't meet my expectations. I couldn't relate to the confident Emma, who at 22 years of age seemed to have an abundance of ""know-how"" and knowledge of the world that doesn't seem to ring true especially in 1959!!"
2,Phoned In,"What a lot of interesting secondary characters! Unfortunately, the main character is pretty much annoying. An abusive stepfather gains our sympahy for the plucky heroine at first, but she's so clueless and chirpy--wow, look at me, folks, I'm having an affair! --we lose the sympathy fast and just keep waiting to see if she stumbles.In the audio version, the narrator does a pretty good job with the various accents, but slips out of Southern a few times."
1,Did I miss something?,"I always have loved Gail Godwin's books, but I think I missed something here. I continued reading and waiting for the story, but it never happened. I gave it one star, because, even though I don't ususally waste time on books that don't draw me in, I did finish it, because I knew Godwin's books and thought there had to be something more to the story. The main character was Marjorie Morningstar without the soul. I second the reviewer who dislikes reviewers who tell the whole story; stop it, please!"
1,Boring,"I'm sorry to say this was a terrible purchase. I thought it was going to be like 'The Amateur Mind' by Silman which is excellent. Instead the book consists soley of players of different levels thinking their way through ten positions. What was supposed to be learned by this is beyond me. I guess the idea was you were to do your own analysis first and then somehow 'rate' yourself by comparing yourself with how others thought through the problems. Well, it's a process that does not work. I consistently did worse than the grandmaster, which somehow did not come as a surprise to me. Also I did consistently better than the beginners and novices, also no surprise. I consider this book the worst one I now -- unfortunately -- own."
5,Fire in the sky.,"This is an amazing book. I never knew much about massive fires and the kind of power they produce. Heat that can melt just about anything instantly. They create their own weather(tornadoes of flame!) The destructive force of huge, freight train of fire!! This story is gripping and tragic. The way some people managed to save themselves is amazing and astonishing. This is a superbly written book. Not a very long book, but packed full of info and a great fast paced and dramatic read. I have read other books on fires but never read of a fire that matched the sheer force of this blaze. This was truly an awe inspiring event. I suggest this book to anyone. Amazing."
4,An engrossing account of an American tragedy,"Researched in great detail, this story is ... gripping, distressing, engrossing, relentlessly horrifying. It was like I couldn't look away from this awful thing, yet I could only deal with one chapter at a sitting; it was just heartbreaking. A ""perfect storm"" of fire conditions. And you can scarcely believe that anyone managed to survive. (The author's great-grandfather did not.) Along the way, you get an education in weather, late-1800s logging practices, fire physics, human behavior in crisis, and, unfortunately, the realities of burn wounds and death by fire."
4,"Informative, easy read","A short but interesting account of the great Hinckley firestorm disaster. I found it interesting and nicely paced, with workmanlike but accessible prose."
3,Somewhat interesting,This CD is great to have if you're a Radiohead completist. Radiohead guitarist Ed O'Brien cowrote 5 of the 20 tracks on the CD and contributed to 4 other tracks. I would recommend this CD only to Radiohead completists or people who watched the miniseries and enjoyed this instrumental music.
2,Better than the one that came after,"The most annoying of the the ""show"" mariachis I was surprised I liked some songs on this album. ""Corazon, Buenas Noches"" is a nice peice as is ""Que Padre es la vida,"" which Luis Aguilar would sing. I really liked the Popurri del Amor and it's one of my favorite on the album. ""Nunca Jamas,"" Lalo Guerrero's hit and Juan Gabriel's ""Constumbres"" go really well. Kudos to Hernandez arrangement on this one. I like the ""trio"" aura they give to the song. The muted trumpets and arrangments on ""Gema"" are done well; they should have had someone else sing it though. The other two popurris ""Penas de Amor"" and ""Popurri de Las Ferias"" are cheese factories. It's alway nice to hear Timoteo ""Tello"" Gonzalez (the guitarest) voice though. There are some gems on this recording."
3,"Okay, but not that great","I liked this cd but not as much as other Sol de Mexico cds. I have Mexico canta con Sol de Mexico and I prefer that one more than this one, even though some of the songs on this one are nice, like Corazon Buenas Neches, Que Padre Es La Vida, Penas de Amor, Es Muy Tu Vida and Mala Mujer. I liked El Rehilete, but that song sounds a like like a mix of Cuerdas de Satin and Tropeterias."
5,excellent,it seems that the more i see these guys perform the more i want to hear them play.they are an awsome mariachi who put all their heart soul and mind to our music
3,This Is A Reprint CD,"This is Slipknot first even album before the self title. Corey sound much better. But as for a hard core slipknot fan. You should get this as a collector's item. It has the original songs from gently, (sic), and many more. The bad thing about this repress cd is the printing quality are so bad. It looks like they use the original cd and scanned it all over from the cd cover to the cd and print it. The quality is terrible. If you can find the original first print from the US, get that one. Its way much better. As for this one, its printed from UK and the finishing is f,ck up!. But I have no choise to get this. I couldn't find the very first print CD. The original CD is already out of print."
4,Worth It.,"I bought this album knowing very well what I was purchasing. The Slipknot of 95 is nowhere near as skilled as the 'Knot we know and love today. Nevertheless, this album ( original or imported duplicate ) is a must-have for any collector, and i believe it was well worth the $50."
1,Mate Feed Kill Repeat,"this cd was given to me by a friend in Iowa. My cd is a little different from the packages i've seen come up.Just for you to know Corey Taylor was the original singer on this c.d. he just came in and did some singing over the 1st singers vocals, so dont expect too much and just for the record this c.d. is not even a licensed c.d., but over all if you must know what the band sounded like and you have to have it BUY IT THEN.. not a gem or even a great c.d. in my opion its not worth the $20.00 these sellers are selling them for..."
1,the original is better,"If you know anything about slipknot you know that this ep is actually rereleased..the original mate.feed.kill.repeat album was released before corey taylor joined slipknot..it was vocaled by Anders Colsefini, whom corey replaced after the release of this album. The band replaced colsefini with taylor because they thought they needed a singer with more radio friendly voice..So i would recommend finding the original mate.feed.kill.repeat ep..if you want to hear the original slipknot...Anders wrote this entire ep himself..All the songs and lyrics and even the title from Mate.Feed.Kill.Repeat are based off a pen-and-paper roleplaying game Werewolf: The Apocalypse..that the band used to play together..so go find the original"
1,-Buyer Beware-,"!!!WARNING-WARNING-WARNING!!!This is a burned-copy with very poor sound. The cover is on cheap paper and was copiedon a piss-poor copy machine. If you do buy this, good luck returning it. You will neverget your money back and will be stuck with this expensive POS!!!"
1,what a Bust,"This is the WORST Slipnot CD. For the price it was not worth it at all. I don't know who this band is ,but it's not slipnot AWFUL."
4,A MUST Have!,What more could you ask for as a Home Improvement guy. A ladder that takes up no more space than briefcase yet carries a 245lb guy.Invaluable and I highly recomend it for any home improvement companies and home inspectors.
3,Rubber foot problem,The first time I tried to use the ladder one of the rubber feet came off. It is apparently only held on with a single machine screw and nut. The foot won't on. When I can figure out to get it done I plan to add a washer so the thing doesn't slip over the nut.This shouldn't be a problem!
2,Convenient but scary,This is the 3rd telescoping ladder I have owned and by far my least favorite. The wide-step is nice but hardly makes up for the amount of movement in the ladder itself. When extended this ladder moves and flexes and moves from side to side. I weigh 140lbs. and find it very uncomfortable. I intend to sell this and have already bought myself the 15.5' Extend and Climb which is a far superior product... I will write a review about it.
1,WHAT YOUR FINGERS WHEN THE LADDER GOES DOWN,"I LIKE THE CONCEPT, BUT THIS IS ONE DANGEROUS LADDER. IF YOU HIT A TAB ON THE SIDE IT CAN FOLD UP ON YOU. DO NOT TRY TO PULL IT UP FROM THE TOP FROM A ROOF. AND IF YOU ARE NEAR THE WEIGHT MAX IT DOES BEND A BIT. IT IS SMALL AND PORTABLE BUT YOU GOT TO KEEP IT CLEAN AND BECAREFUL WHEN CLIMBING. I WOULD NOT USE WHEN I STOPPED USING MINE, I RECYCLED IT I DID NOT WANT THIS BACK OUT TO SOME ONE THAT MIGHT NOT KNOW HOW TO USE THE PRODUCT SAFELY. THE LADDER IS JUST RIGHT FOR A ONE STORY ROOF, BUT IT JUST IS NOT A SAFE AS MY LITTLE GIANT AND ABOUT DOUBLE THE WEIGHT. I DID NOT FEEL SAFE ON THIS LADDER. AND I AM WELL UNDER THE WEIGHT MAX. IT SHOULD BE RATED FOR NO MORE THEN 200 LBS."
2,Strange hookless ornament,"Cute, but not really an ornament. There is no way to hang it on a Christmas tree."
3,The Baboon King,"The Baboon King, written by Anton Quintana, is a book about a boy living in African culture. The book takes place in Africa and demonstrates how important family is and shows a connection between human and the wild plains of Africa. This is an interesting and sad book. I personally wouldn't recommend it though.I wouldn't recommend it, because of the way the book is written. The book shows a lot of animals being killed and describes how they look after they die too much. The boy gets kicked out of both his father's tribe and mother's tribe. He has no friends and no one likes him. It's sad and mean. The book should be more about caring then hatred.You've my reasons and I've told you why I don't recommend this book. If you want to read a book about African culture or about the wild then this is a good choice for you. If you don't like killing or the wild then I wouldn't read it."
3,No Worth It For Film Fans,"If you're looking to buy this for the movies alone and not the extras, then I recommend the 2-pack. If you're interested in the extra features, then buy the dvd's separately because Blade 2 is a ""movie only"" dvd and doesn't include the audio commentary or any of the other extra materials on the Platinum Version. The extra look at Blade 3 has 25 minutes of footage from a sci-fi convention where David Goyer, Jessica Biel and Ryan Reynolds talk about the film. It has three extra snippets of Blade 3 and includes the trailer. It's not bad, but I feel cheated with the non-platinum Blade 2."
5,Helpful!,"For all students, this book could be helpful in learning about George Washington, but for second language learners of any age the pictures assist in making connections so that the story can be told and understood. I appreciate this book very much!"
1,Hmmmmmm. Political Skew at AMAZON.,"As I write this, it is June 2006.And I'm still waiting for this bumper sticker to deliver on its promises."
5,Great for worked out examples,"Good for looking at how the problems are suppose to be worked out. This book helped me a lot, mainly due to the main text book having a lack of example problems. This book is full of example problem; however know theory accompanies this book so the main text would be required for a better understanding of fluids."
2,A WASP among eagles: The story of an exceptional woman living during difficult times.,"I enjoyed reading the story of Ann Baumgartner Carl, an aviatrix that challenged the bigotry and mysoginy of the 1940s United States in order to serve her country. The book, as it was, was interesting and enjoyable. Its problem is that it is too short and sometimes only brushes subjects that a reader may wish to know more about. I would have liked in particular to learn more about the personalities of a few people described in the book and who played important roles in the aviation career of the author. This book is still a good bet however to pass some quiet time at home or during a trip."
5,Diego Cuddle Pillow is a huge hit!,"Our 2-year old granddaughter is a big fan of Dora and Diego, especially Diego. We ordered the Diego Cuddle Pillow for her 2nd birthday last week and it was the hit of the party. He's almost as big as she is, but she carried him around all weekend and introduced him to everyone at the party. We were delighted."
5,Go Diego Go!!,I had to order Diego for my son from the U.S because there is not any merchandise here in England. Diego arrived within a week and is fantastic! my 20 month old is crazy about Diego and loves his new cuddle pillow. Its nearly as big as him!
3,Good food for thought - could use a little salt,"For anyone interested in getting more information on Grotowski, this is of course a must-read, although occasionally the humility with which Richards infuses his prose borders on making it a must-slog-through. In a way, it's appealing that Richards tends to describe only his own work - only the things that he himself did, but I tend to find the descriptions fuzzy. I often felt the descriptions of exercises or actions were not concrete enough for me to imagine them; this is by no means a practical handbook.Having said that, it is an excellent read for probably every serious actor, who will recognize in Richards' frank account their own mistakes, frustration over lack of discipline, and impatient desires to be brilliant. Definitely inspiring, occasionally repetitive or unclear."
1,High Quality?,"High quality German steel blades MY BUTT! These are cheap chinese imports AND this is the SECOND review I'm writing. I guess Amazon didn't like my first, warning potential customers of the terminological inexactitude stated in the description and choosing not so eloquent verbiage in doing so!DON'T say I didn't warn you! The old addage ""you get what you pay for"" really rings true with these first class pieces of junk."
2,You get what you pay for,"Maybe worth the low price, but definately not a diamond in the rough. The cutting edges on mine were nicked and not sharper than my harbor freight ones that have been used. They are made in China (note ""Sheffield-like steel"") with silk-screened logos."
5,Sura rocks,"Sura Flow is gentle yet invigorating. Sura takes us softly through these unique low impact exercises to stretch the body, center the mind, and slow down our heart rate - in short to promote the relaxation response. It works!Her techniques are simple enough that ANYONE can do them, yet most of us will be able to feel so much better while doing them, and after. Sura's calm demeanor and clear expertise shine through."
5,Gentle and Energizing,"I love this DVD! The different play options allow me to pick a practice or meditation based on what I feel like and how much time I have. It's easy to follow along and Sura's voice is warm and soothing. The flowing practice is gentle yet energizing and I feel calm, strong and present when I'm finished. This is truly yoga from the heart. Thanks Sura!"
3,Different,Not sure Sura Flow is my style of yoga. Program was filmed in beautiful location and instructor was very clear. Personally I prefer more traditional Hatha and could not really get into this style of yoga.
4,Good but fragile,"I love the comfort of these headsets. They completely surround your ears, so no one can hear what you're listening to. They do not squeeze my head too much, and I do not have pain from wearing them for hours at at ime (I play World of Warcraft). My only complaint is that about two weeks after buying them, the small plastic clip that holds the speaker and the cushion to the plastic frame of the headset broke, and I had to superglue it on to continue using it.They still sound great, and I will continue to wear them. They just aren't made of a very high-quality material."
3,"Descent for the price, could be better.","Pros:-Descent sound quality for the average customer (stereo, not surround). The sound quality for music and games is quite solid, even at high volume.-Fits my head comfortably. After 30 minutes I forget that I'm wearing them.-Fair price (about $20).Cons:-Noticable white noise when nothing is playing.-Chincey construction (Whatever you do, make sure these don't fall on the floor).-Poor microphone sensitivity (I have to raise my voice to a borderline yell with the microphone touching my mouth in order for others to hear me).In review, nothing spectacular. Just an average headset for someone with a shallow pocketbook."
3,very comfy... two minor flaws,"I wanted a comfy headset... and this is it.But, the microphone is apparently weaker than the Logitech 350 USB model (my previous but less comfy headset).And, if you place the mic pin into the microphone port, you must restart your computer before your machine recognizes its presence."
2,Not Durable Enough,I expected way more from this headset the sound quality was ok and it broke in two months.
2,very fragile,"i had 2 of these headsets and they are very FRAGILE,if you are careful i would recomend it but if u want durability DONT get this"
5,Aimee goes 11 for 11,"Aimee's vocal's and songwriting have never been stronger. Every song is a gem in it's own right. The overt subject matter of a few songs is drug addiction and the emotional ramifications for both the addicted and the partner (High on Sunday 51, This is how it Goes). Many of the other songs may also appear drug-related (Humpty Dumpty, Real Bad News, The Moth). The arrangements are excellent. The lyrics are intelligent, heartfelt, and upon listening to them and reading along I became concerned about Aimee- wondering whether drug addiction is something that she or a loved one is going through or has recently gone through. Can anyone listen to Aimee's music without feeling some connection with her? In any case- this could be Aimee's best album. For me it blows away ""Bachelor"", it's probably better than ""Stupid"" (great album!) and is as good as the classic ""Whatever"". Five very large stars!!"
3,Just as good as Bachelor No. 2,"Lost in Space seems to have better lyrics and a little more developed than Bachelor No. 2, but for some reason I sill like Bachelor more....I guess it's just that this album felt a bit homogenous, no song really standing out. While it's good to have cohesiveness, it's not good when you can't remember any of the songs after you've listened to the album 3 or 4 times."
4,Pretty good but not her best.,"This CD has some great tracks, the first being one of them, but isn't as good as her earlier CDs. Still, if you like Aimee Mann, you won't be disappointed. She's a great singer-songwriter, and that make this album worth the money."
3,FANS ONLY,"BACHELOR NO. 2 was an undeniably great record. Every song stood on its own, and all were well written. LOST IN SPACE is not quite that lofty. All the songs on this record drag along at the same slow, belabored tempo. The only catchy hook on the album is the chorus to ""Guys Like Me,"" one of the better songs. There doesn't seem to be as much good sarcasm, and crass wit in Mann's lyrics this time around, especially in the particularly bad ""Humpty Dumpty"" and where the lyrics do soar, again, ""Guys Like Me,"" the music mostly plods along.My main point is that this album isn't as well-written as BACHELOR NO. 2, or WHATEVER, and isn't anywhere near as inspired as songs from the MAGNOLIA SOUNDTRACK.Mann's previous albums all contain, and provoke thought, and emotion. The only emotion I feel when listening to this album is depression about the fact that Aimee Mann has made a mediocre record.This review has been helpful to ALF."
2,Spacey & Lost,"First of all, lest anyone should think I have no taste whatsoever, let me make something clear: Mann's ""Bachelor No.2"" is one of the most brilliant records of the last decade. OK? Now, unfortunately, we come to ""Lost in Space"" which has to be (and I still can't really believe it) one of the most disappointing records in recent memory. Most of the songs here are just bad. Shockingly weak stuff. Cliches piled on top of cliches. And still more cliches. And weak lyrics, too. You think I'm kidding? Listen for yourself. But remember: no one held a gun to your head. Or did they?"
2,Fall from Grace,"It would have been almost impossible to follow up the almost perfect ""Bachelor No. 2"" with something equal to it, but this CD is so inferior to it that I must say that I was startled when I heard it. Much of the problem is the material. Most of this sounds like out-takes from ""Bachelor No. 2"" that should have been left in the vault. The songs are hard to differentiate from one another and the whole affair has a certain monotonous feel. Part of the problem: never, ever, ever let your guitarist produce your CD! Michael Lockwood (who also plays for Carly Simon!!!) takes a turn here and his heavy-handed dirge-like stylings are, in large part, the culprit. But Mann must also take responsibility for this turgid collection. Literary though the lyrics may be, the themes are old and the observations not as finely wrought as before. This CD merely treads water. It remains to be seen whether Mann has what it takes to sustain her musical vision. Disappointing."
2,Is this what we have come to?,"I can sum this album up very easily: background music for a ""family car"" commercial. Bought it because i was so impressed by her stuff on Magnolia, and the cover looks cool(which is stupid of me!). But this music is almost difficult to listen to, much less pay attention to lyrical content, etc... No hooks. No good melodies that you will find yourself humming in the shower. in fact, i'll go as far as to say, i dont know how music like this actually makes it to record store shelves. Had more faith in ""the toughest business in the world"" i guess. My advice: skip this and just bang your head into a wall. Its a better way to get a headache."
4,Not just another dependably listenable Aimee Mann album,"While many would agree that Aimee Mann's work is a unique species of flawed genius, it's hard to reach any consensus on which elements are the flaws and which demonstrate the genius. For my money, the overwrought production and unconcealed fury of 'I'm with Stupid' brought out the best in her. Here, to my surprise, moderate production integrates nicely with modulated rage, creating a mood of eerie desperation that is very, very compelling. That's where the genius comes in. The flaws are the relatively dull 'This Is How It Goes' and the obvious 'Guys Like Me'. But nobody's perfect."
5,"dark, lonely, cold, creepy, sad & soothing...","""Lost In Space,"" like most of Aimee Mann's albums, perfectly captures a feeling. The mood of ""Lost In Space"" feels exactly the way the CD cover looks: dark, lonely, cold, creepy, sad & soothing- all at the same time. These songs seep into your soul and unnerve you. I think it's a perfect follow-up to ""Bachelor No. 2"" in that it is just as impressively penned and performed, yet paints it's tales with a deeper, blue-er palette. Both ""Bachelor"" and ""Lost"" envelope you in their unique aura and leave you deeply moved. That's what great art does."
4,Her Best Yet,"Say what you will about the mastery of 'Bachelor #2', I find 'Lost in Space' to be far superior. I like and appreciate all her solo works (I *love* 'I'm With Stupid' and the 'Magnolia' soundtrack), but this one resonates with me.Lyrically, Mann is a smart and clever writer (name another song that includes Pavlov's Bell) - which is one reason she'll never get mass radio exposure. G-d forbid you have to think to listen. I love ""This is how it Goes"", ""Invisible Ink""....well all of them. Almost. To this day, I have not been able to get into ""Guys Like Me"".Though 'The Moth' could have deteriorated into bland cliches w/the 'drawn to the flame' sentiment - it contains one of the best lyrics I have heard in a long time ""...and nothing fuels a good flirtation like need and anger and desperation.."" (ain't THAT the truth!).Possibly the best album of 2002."
5,Forever Will Aimee Be The Mann!!!,"Aimee Mann, who is one of the greatest songwriters of our time, has finally re-emerged after her 2000 release, the mesmerizing Bachelor No. 2, with the glorious Lost In Space. Like its predeccesor, this album was independantly released and now, Aimee sound is more in charge than ever. Her songwriting is still uncompromisingly clever and intelligent. Songs like the lush ""Humpty Dumpty"", the darkly beautiful title track, and the intense ""Invisible Ink"" show that Aimee hasn't lost her biting edge and remarkable spark. This album also showcases that Aimee is one of the most legendary singer/songwriters whose artistic success rivals those of Rickie Lee Jones, Joni Mitchell, and Jackson Browne and to have the ability to do that is a victory in itself. BUY IT, TODAY!!!"
5,loneliness and isolation make great company.........,"listening to this cd is like trying to find your way home in the dark.great lyrics, tremendous songwriting structure.nobody can be able to create a song better than aimee.""today's the day"" is the main title for JENNIFER LOPEZMOVIE, ""ENOUGH""---if anyone is interested."
5,+++ awesome lighter+++,"This lighter is just awesome, it is way hotter than others and so it is easyer to start a fire or do other things with it.The price is OK- it's good quality, the only not realy bad thing, but also not good thing is, that you have to refill it very often, so I advise to buy a refill gas bottle.At all it is a nice thing.+++"
5,Beast Lighter,This is by far the best torch lighter i have taken camping. It starts the camp fires very quickly and easily. Once the flame is at its perfection length there is nothing you cannot burn through.
4,"Revisited childhood memories, spoiled by poor sound quality.","I do enjoy the Davey and Goliath series on DVD, the first 4 volumes would be completely 5 Stars if the sound quality hadn't been so poor on Volume 1. I did enjoy watching it again and reliving the wonderful childhood memories of these episodes. I, too, am disappointed, to put it mildly, by the poor sound quality. As much as I like to see them the way I remember them, it would be great if the sound quality was at least as good as it was on Volumes 2, 3, 4. I found them to be of better quality. Still, I am pleased to have them in my collection. Would like to know who to complain to about the poor quality of the audio though and will it ever be corrected?"
2,audio terrible,As others here have said the audio is terrible and I should have looked at reviews before buying this.
5,Very Good,"I loved the 4 episodes. The morals to the stories are better that I remembered. The first episode was very faint in sound, though. I had to turn the volume all the way up to hear it. The other episodes sounded fine. I also ordered the Holiday pack, can't wait to see it!"
3,A good set of reminders,Thematic Preaching doesn't really have anything new to say about preaching but it is well organized and includes some helpful reminders that faciliate making the worship experience more spiritual for those in the congregation. These reminders were refreshing to me as they helped refresh my own spirituality.
2,Weak has many errors,This book has many errors and the topics are not covered in a good way making it hard to follow.
3,A mixed bag,"She did it to me again. Tepper builds a solid, clear and convincing world, creates a compelling and three-dimensional set of characters, sets up an intriguing plot that builds logically and excitingly to a climax and then-- well, I still am not sure exactly what the heck happened. It's like someone else finishes the book for her-- all of that solid logical specific foundation disppears ion metaphysical poetically vagur fog. Perhaps a reader more gifted than I would get that part, but for me it was 9/10ths of a great novel."
4,"Beautiful, haunting, at times shocking","Every time I read a Sheri S. Tepper novel I finish with thatshivery feeling that comes from reading a great story -- onethat is equal parts uplifting and disturbing. ""Shadow's End""is no different; once again, Tepper has taken the archetypesof speculative fiction and given them new life, making themher own.On the surface, this is a quest story; thequest of a group of people for the salvation of the humancolonial enterprise across the stars. But what they find isfar from what they expected, and in the climax and stunningdenouement, Tepper has incorporated some important commentaryon motherhood, patriarchy, and both individual and communalresponsibility, without once resorting to preachiness ormoralizing. A VERY impressive book."
3,Not her best...,"Though Tepper is my favorite writer of all time, they can't all be winners. Shadow's End is a mishmash of themes, none of which is satisfactorily fleshed out. If you're a fan it's worth a read, but if you're new to the amazing worlds and wonderful prose of Sheri S. Tepper, read Beauty, Grass, or Raising the Stones instead."
1,audio reading suffers,"The reader overacts and has some whiny character voices, which grate the nerves. It's hard to pay attention to the story. For instance, one of her characters is supposed to ""bark"" the dialogue, but the reader still whines. The story itself may be a good one. I couldn't tell."
4,Great,"Pretty great, abit slow at first, with an unbelievable ending that didn't seem complete. BUt still worth buying and reading. An altogether interesting, facinating experience!"
3,Nice item,These earrings are nice; they are smaller and the diamonds are much smaller than I expected but they are okay. They are a great purchase for a teenager or someone who likes really small diamonds. Great price.
4,SUBTITLES RAWR,"I love this movie. Love, love, love. But I speak Swedish. I don't need the subtitles. BUT I CAN'T TURN THEM OFF. Forgive my rage, but this is so frustrating!"
5,A must-read book,"Amy Dacyzyn is that rare thing in contemporary America--a person who believes the American dream is still attainable. She believes that people's financial goals are attainable, not through earning more but through saving more. This book focuses on teaching readers the basics of a frugal lifestyle; readers are told how to save money on everything from groceries to weddings. Far from merely giving helpful hints, _The Tightwad Gazette_ shows the reader how to figure out what is the most economical alternative among many, how to calculate savings, and make thrifty choices--skills they can then apply to their own unique situations. In addition to the excellent practical advice, Dacyzyn has some interesting things to say about the psychological side of frugality; she clearly believes that saving money is fun and, before they're through with this book, her readers will too"
3,Sorely Needs Updated,"Most of my praise or criticism can be found in other reviews posted here. However, there's one point I did not see mentioned. The book is old and sorely needs a revised edition.While the principles are timeless and many ideas and recipes are current, a book written on penny-pinching pre the advent of the Internet is lacking in a lot of ways.Missing is use of email, consumer websites and online resources, online banking, various technological advances as well as current price comparisons, interest rates, etc.Finally, while there are many helpful and worthwhile suggestions that make the book worthwhile, there are plenty to make you cringe. When thrift comprises hygienic practices, as I believe it does in some cases, it's time to draw the line."
5,buy no other books,"This is a massively practical handbook on ways to cut your costs to the bone, how to gain financial health, and how to decide just what you find important (and how important). Thought-provoking as well as practical. It may just change your life. This is a fundamental reference that WILL be of value to you. If you can only afford to buy two books this year, make this both of them."
3,Decide what to use from this book and ignore the rest,"Although there are some reasonable suggestions in here, and I now know I'm not alone in washing out Ziploc bags to reuse, I'm worried at Amy's encouraging families to give up a second income using the advice that where she lives, in Maine, people on less than $30,000 per year incomes (this must have gone up since the book was written) can get subsidies on their mortgage. Call me old fashioned, but doesn't this sort of thinking encourage people to live off the state instead of working when you're perfectly fit and able to do so, leaving less for those who are in true need of it? I also was horrified reading about her advice on homemade baby formula. The health of your children is priceless, and to jeaopardise that could be the costliest mistake of your life.Like a previous reviewer said, take it with a pinch of salt."
5,A Must Have!,"I have 3 of the author's books. And would not part with any of them. I lost my job 8 years ago due to my pregnancy. We didn't know how we were going to eat. I saw the author on Donahue and had hope. Not only have I managed to remain a stay at home mom, we owe no money except a small mortgage. And we have managed to travel to France, England, Scotland, and a yearly trip to Orlando. If my house was burning, these books would be the 1st thing I would grab! You won't use all of their ideas, but it starts you thinking in the correct manner to get out of debt. And stay out of debt!"
5,Fun and mostly practical,"I really enjoyed reading this book. I used many of the recipes and ideas. In acknowledging the previous review, there are some thrift ideas that I would never use; the author takes thrift to new extremes-- but many ideas were highly practical! The extreme ideas often gave me a good chuckle. I liked the little glimpses the book gave me into her life..her goal of owning a pre-1900 farmhouse with attached barn..and her unexpected twins. Being thrifty, I got the book out from the library, but I am at this site because I will give a (used) copy as a gift!"
5,Best Christmas Album I have ever own.,Best Christmas Album I have ever own. I own many Christmas albums but this one reminds me of Christmas as a child. Anything by Steve Green is worth it. He writes nothing but music straight from the heart. You can hear it in every song. My Children love to listen to it.
5,Highlight reel fans rejoice,"If you like to watch highlight reels, then you'll enjoy this. If you demand full fights, skip this. The disc skims past all of the fight to the 30 or so seconds surrounding the actual submission. I popped this in thinking I'd see some decent ones, but was pleasantly surprised that these submissions actually kick ass. The blu-ray video quality is sharp. Has some submissions from the early days of UFC (featuring Coleman and Gracie and Sakuraba) which are fun to watch. Also has a handful of extra submissions, making the total a couple dozen. Well worth the price and if you get a kick out of seeing ground technique win fights then you'll enjoy this."
4,limited submissions,"armbar, triangle choke and rear naked choke. that's what you will see in this dvd and a lot of them. you do get the nodd kimura or arm trianlge, but mainly just the first 3.you do get a lot of matches though.is it worth your time and money? maybe. yes if you really like submissions and because there isn't any other submissions dvd out. no because these are just the same submissions you see at every mma and bjj event and gyms."
1,RUN FOR YOUR LIVES !,"Having grown up in the 1960's, long before cable, I spent many winter weekends with Garbo, Harlow, Laurel and Hardy, Valentino, and the other greats from the golden days of Hollywood. Amoung my favorites were The Dagwood and Blondie movies. When I seen that Platinum Disk was offering the Blonie movies I leaped on it and bought Vol 1 and 2. How disappointed I was when they arrived. These are nothing but syndication prints. The sound and picture quality is very good but, heavely edited. Unless you just dont care and need a quick fix of Blondie get them, otherwise I would suggest that when you see them for sale you shun them, point at them, scream and run. Hopefully, someday, the studio will release a franchise collection and give us the ""REAL"" Blondie movies."
4,Great movies,These movies will have you laughing out loud. I am very pleased with the quality. I would recomend these to anyone who enjoys the old time comadies.
2,5* for the movies but Poor Encoding - Quality Suffers,"Poor quality encoding. During high motion (Dagwood running out the door late for the bus, or Daisy running to get the newspaper) you'll be sure to notice blocky video. I'm sure the originals didn't have that. There are also errors noticed during playback such as garbled video (during ""Blondie"") you'd see normally if the DVD was dirty or scratched (it's not either from what I could see.)Regardless of the above, the movies are still very enjoyable to watch and I appreciate the fact that they're available on DVD.Conclusion: Movies get 5 Stars and DVD production/compression gets 2 stars."
1,BUYER BEWARE,"Listening to Kayak music has been a great joy of mine for over 30 years. The band has never disappointed - until now. Because of the nature of this stage production, the release should NOT be credited to the band itself, although they contribute. Please do NOT start here if you wish to discover the band - try ""Royal Bed Bouncer"" or the first two. I regret feeling so strongly as to post this review. The band is phenomenal - ""Nostradamus"" is not."
4,The Language of Baseball: A complete Dictionary of Slang Terms,All baseball lovers should buy this book to share with people who are not baseball fans. I will take it to games with me this year for conversation.
2,Dissapointment,"While this book covers the terms & slang of baseball, the definitions are brief, dull, and give zero background. A good example is ""Ueker Seats"" defined as the highest seats in the park, but doesn't even mention Bob Ueker, or the origin of the expression! The whole book is like that. I thought this would be fun to go through with my son, but I am already looking for a new baseball dictionary."
4,The ins and outs of Wentworth Prison,"Prisoner Cell Block H was a hit TV series , from Australia , from 1979 to 1986.It revolves around the lives of the inmates and wardens of Wentworth Prison.Quite a compelling series , both amusing and filled with a lot of violence and feuds between prisoners and prisoners or prisoners and wardens.Fun characterization , you will always want to see what Bea , Monica, Lizzie , Noelene , Lynne, Karen etc are up to next. It also explores the loneliness and despair of prison life"
1,so why is this not on DVD for the U.S.,"love this show, and alot of people in the U.S, so why is this not a DVD release for the U.S??????????????"
2,Inane Sophmoric Lyrics,"Tempted by the promise of finding an intellegent, hardrocking band I purchased this CD. Unfortunately, while the tunes could be catchy and the musicianship was good, the lyrics were pretty much alternating between banal tripe and overblown ""social"" commentary. These guys are not like Swervedriver, despite comparisons made in the press."
5,Amazing!!!,"I flew all the way to Las Vegas from Tennessee just to see Air Supply, which is alot for a 14 year old. I'm so glad they put ""Miracles"" on this one. I love that song. While some say that Russell's voice has gone down, I say give the guy a break. He's my hero, and I was lucky enough to meet him and Graham. Russell Hitchcock has one of the most humble, and kind human souls you'll ever meet.He honestly won't boast if you compliment him on his singing, instead he'll just say, and I quote ""Oh, I'm no role model when it comes to being a singer"",unquote. I'm a very romantic kind of guy. A ""Love Songs"" compilation from my favorite band is a blessing from God. BUY THIS NOW!!! God bless Russell Hitchcock!!!"
4,80's hits plus one new song !,"I just wanted to bring up a point a previous reviewer made. They mentioned that the one new song ""Miracles"" should have been credited to Graham Russell and not Air Supply. Not sure why. The song is written by Graham and sung by Russell Hitchcock so it is a true Air Supply song through and through. It's a beautiful song that I had the privildge of hearing in concert and is worth the price of the CD alone. Air Supply made great music all through the 90's and are still doing so into the new millennium !"
1,Bad Battery,"Bought in Jan 09, put in portable phone that never gets used. Dead by Aug 09. What more is there to say?"
1,Died in 4 months,Bought in June after seeing positive reviews. Died in October after 4 months and will not hold a charge at all.
5,Perfect Replacement,"This battery is not a cheap knock-off as you often get shopping on the internet, it is manufactured by Motorola."
2,whats on the cover is not included in the contents of this dvd,this dvd was very disapointing it did not have the road warriors in it.thats the main reason i ordered it.I called amazon to tell them about this.they sent me the same dvd without the road warrior in it.Im returning both of them.in the future I hope whats on the cover of the dvd is included in the contents in it.
2,WHY???? WHEN????,"I cant believe that another DVD comes out about the Greatest Steel Cage matches??? ever???? And two of the most awesome matches are nowhere to be found again........Of course I am talking about Ric Flair vs Ron Garvin(Starrcade 87... and Dusty Rhodes vs Lex Luger(Starrcade 87)...I have seen a few of these sets come out now and there is no sign of these matches anywhere.. I was even hoping that when the Starrcade set came out they would put these two on there...Of course.. no such luck. I am so tired of dvd sets coming out with the same matches that they have released before over and over...it is so tiresome.... How hard can this be??? With all due respect, i will pass on this set.. again... Maybe the wwe should put someone in charge of their video library that has some clue of what the old school fans and even the new school ones would like..."
3,Looks promising but not holding my breath!!!,"Hopefully the WWE will come through on this one. The last 2 disc set Bloodbath was just o.k. had moments but just seem hastily assembled!!!! Hoping for a good set this time out. Normally the WWE dvds are top notch, but in the last year they seem to be slipping somewhat. Hoping the Nitro best of and this set will turn things around once again."
2,Mac OSX Users Beware,"The Lightscribe function on this drive doesn't work properly with OSX, even if you download the software and firmware updates. Labels are hazy and very faint. There is a 1.02 update for the LaCie Lightscribe Label software that is supposed to fix this function but, oddly, it doesn't do anything, which is why you can now only download it from other websites (LaCie took the update down from their own site). LaCie is working on a firmware update for this drive, but as of 10/05/05 customer support said the update was still in beta. The Lightscribe company itself has issued an update, but only for Windows PCs.On the plus side, it looks real pretty and burns audio CDs really fast. But then again, you aren't considering this drive just for the normal burn functions, are you?"
5,Excellent Replacement for Flimsy Toyota OEM Flap on Tacoma,"These were a great replacement for the OEM flaps on my 2005 DC Tacoma which were tearing off from wind load alone (had not been offroad) after 5yrs. I did have to make a couple of spacers because of the step in the wheel well liner, and I made a small sheet metal tab/bracket to connect the inboard edge of the flap to a screw that it wouldn't reach. The look is great, and 11 months later, I'm very satisfied."
2,too generic!,"The splashguards fit the shape of the wheelwell. However, their are two recesses on the Toyota frame which had corresponding molded indentions on the Toyota factory splashguards. These replacement guards are not molded to fit the spaces. So, . . . the plastic screws provided are not long enough to reach the threaded holes. And, . . . there is no threaded plastic screws to hold the upper part of the guard to the wheelwell. The Toyota original part had two or three holes in the wheelwell for each flap. I rate the product as good, in terms of shape, but poor in terms attachment accessories. The price seemed too good to be true, and perhaps it was."
3,Poweflow 6417 Pro-Fit Toyota truck slpash gauards,Spend the extra money and get ones that fit the truck. I bought these for a 2005 4x4 toyota truch. Took an effort to install and they still don't look right. Much smaller than originals and don't line up to original flaps.
5,Better than OEM,"Better looking and higher quality than the OEM mud flaps that broke off my 2005 Toyota Tacoma. The OEM Toyota mud flaps are prone to breaking, but these ones have a smaller profile and are much more flexible and durable. Honestly I think they look better too. Installation requires drilling a few holes in the underside of the plastic fender flare, so make sure you have someone standing about 15 feet away to make sure you are holding them level before you start to drill. Great product overall."
3,Powerflow 6417,"I put this product on my 2009 Nissan Frontier, looks great and looks tough with the rubber material instead of plastic. Good alternative to the OEM splashguards and reasonable price as well. As for the product, I had troubles installing them because it doesn't sit perfectly, but with a few adjustments and after 45 mins. I was able to install all 4 splashguard. (Note: I bought two pair). All in all good product and I have them on my truck for the past couple months and works the way it should work."
3,It's OK,It stated that it would fit my 2008 Saturn Outlook. It does but not with out some modifications (Cutting it down to size that looks better). The material it's made of is pretty good. Not really what I wanted but I'll keep it. Too much trouble to send back.
4,Protection,These mudflaps fit well on my 2006 GMC truck. They are flexible and appear durable and will protect my new nerf bars.
1,Very over hyped,Read and excerpt of this book and you have read the whole thing. It basically tells you to hit yourself in the head to make your sub conscious wake up and do something for you. Very limited on subject matter and useful tactics for improvements. We were going to read this as a discussion book for a mastermind group and decided it wasn't worth discussing.
4,11th Element,"Like it. Great info. Worth the read. Do the work. Gosh, I wish the author wasn't so wordy though. It would make the read much more vibrant and influential."
5,Liked it!,"My wife bought this book and I ended up stealing it away from her (for now, I'll give it back). I thought at first that this sounded bizarre (The 11th Element theme) but this book actually gives you great advice on how to really think like a CEO. It's good to read through books like these just to get your mind in gear for success."
4,You are the CEO,"Bob Scheinfeld puts the onus in its proper place. You can guide your success! He teaches the reader how to tap into the infinite and gain your inner longings, with the help of a concourse of invisible possibility makers, to align yourself for success.The 11th Element uses ancient, time-proven wisdom but advances it by teaching you what he discovered based on an unfinished converstation with his grandfather. He then expands that conversation with research and his own methods of testing into a forward reaching formula that teaches you the secret.Scheinfeld teaches you how to make a request. Other success thinkers don't go this far. He does. He shows you in clear form how to formulate a request, how to clear negativity, and how to recognize when you need to amend what you thought you wanted.Buy The 11th Element. Study the book, inculcate the content, and apply the formula. The secret has been unlocked!"
4,Important Framework,"If you were browsing in a bookstore and had any interest in this subject, you would most likely buy this book. It provides an important foundation and is for the reader who wants to know the framework of ecological economics -- its origins, its scope (how it is distinct from environmental economics), its uses and its future direction."
3,"Delivery is fast and reliable, but the matzos are OVERBURNT and too much of charcoal is not good","Amazon as always delivers these matzos fast and reliable, but the matzos themselves are as always overburnt and have too much charcoal at the edges. I clean them regularly of charcoal before eating, but would prefer not to do so, if Manischewitz cooks them better."
3,Great buy but not then again not so great (see below),"When I saw this matzo, I bought it for Passover since it was almost 1/2 the price of what the same Kosher for Passover Matzo was selling for in the stores.And that's the catch. It's NOT kosher for Passover and I have no desire to go through eight boxes of Matzo during the year. It should be clearly labeled as what it is not so that no one else makes the same mistake."
4,Back to the Polo Gronuds,"This book is an one special of its kind. It's like ""Lost Ballparks"" but enfocused only at the mythic Polo Grounds. The simply evocation of the name of the former field of the baseball's Giants wake up alots of events and personalities all very well descripted there in the book. Highly recommended.One only thing I didn't like from the book: its binding."
4,Not too bad for an impulse buy.,"I came across this as I was looking for the music from the movie 'Ice Age', unfortunately the soundtrack does not contain this wonderful group's music.I was pleasantly surprised that the music on this CD was not all the same. They had a lot of various melodies and the lead singer has a great voice that reminds me a lot of David Byrne (The Talking Heads).It was worth the money and I highly recommend anyone check out their music. I can't wait to catch some more of their older stuff."
3,Interesting Band,"This is an interesting band that I found out about because of their song ""Send me on my Way,"" which was featured in the movie ""Matilda."" That is a great song, but the others on this disc are very different. The band is very diverse. I do like the lead singer's voice, but not many of the songs stick out to me. I absolutely love ""Send me on my Way,"" though."
3,"Rusted Root ""Live"" is a much better collection than this.","Rusted Root Liveis a FAR superior collection, not to mention a great representation of a live Rusted Root performance. Skip this one and pick up ""Live"" instead."
3,"The Firm, rehashed","The plot was too similar to The Firm for me to find it really enjoyable. I found some parts of it largely unrealistic: Ryan's hiring package, Ryan's hacker skills equating with secret agent skills, his VR system and its ""usefullness"".But the action was well written, and it held my interest for a plane ride."
5,Reaching MBA heights in a fraction of the time,"This text is a practical review for those with an MBA or a clear concise presentation for those of us who wish we had an MBA. For the profit or non-profit manager or CEO, this book gives the reader the tools to move to a new level of competance. Marketing, strategy planning, statistics, accounting and finance are all explored in a simple but complete manner. Its the best read available for those of us who find ourselves in business with no business background."
3,Valuable but cumbersomely presented early film history,"This reader was frankly a bit disappointed by ""Balboa Films."" Yes, all the infomation is there but is is a tough task to separate the actual history of the little company from the hyperbole. The authors have for some reason bought into the era's flowery press agentry and their Balboa Amusement Producing Company is on several pages compared to the later M-G-M in importance. Still and all, any book on the early film industry -- especially local film-making away from Hollywood -- is greatly appreciated. Despite its flaws, ""Balboa Films"" is recommended reading."
5,Balboa Studios history finally told!,"I have this book, and found it fascinating. It is very well illustrated, and brings out of obscurity many important stars and directors, and provides significant info on Baby Marie Osborne, who is 87 and living in California. Thumbs up, highly recommended!"
3,Don't listen to the abridged book on tape,"I absolutely have loved listening to the other novels by this author, but for some reason Covenant decided to record this 334 page novel onto only two tapes. It was like listening to a book report rather than hearing an uplifting novel. The characters never were developed and I was often confused as to who they were and what they were doing. I know I'll need to read the book now, but I would have loved to listened to the story as well."
3,"Enjoyed this second book, but still has poor editing","I enjoyed the first book in this series enough to seek out this second book. I enjoyed it just as much as the first, maybe even more so because Michele took us on a wonderful travel adventure through Europe. But I was still frustrated by the lack of thorough editing this book had before hitting publication. Forms of words were misused, punctuation was hit and miss, and the tenses even got switched a couple of times. It's too bad, because these errors really pulled me out of the story, hurting an otherwise very good story."
3,Easy To Read,"As a avid quilter looking to go beyond the patchwork style I bought this book. The templates are actually on the pages for you to photocopy. The photos are beautiful, and some great quilts are included. The main disappointment is I was hoping for lots of quilting designs, and there were very few. They include trapunto, and a few floral designs. The quilts include a crazy quilt, fan, pineapple log cabin and more. I do really like that it includes a section on whole cloth quilts. For a beginning to intermediate hand quilter this would be a good book."
4,healing,good read. hard to get through some parts but theraputic. not helpful for every one. my spouce loved the chapter for SOs but my sister did not find it to be helpful where as i found it a comfort and a guid e to some of my emotions that i had fought with for a number of years
5,Fab,Kept kids entertained during the hurricane. Harmless entertainment which provides hours of fun for all the family to enjoy. Recommend
2,A semitone too high!,"I have absolutely no objections concerning the interpretation and the choir, which has got the right ""Russian"" sound; but whether depending on the recording or the setting, it consequently sounds a semitone higher than any other recording I have heard - for instance, it sounds as if it would begin in D flat instead of in C etc. You certainly don't have to be a musical freak to find that odd - the keys have got totally different luster! I find it almost impossible to enjoy the recording simply because I have the persistent feeling that there is something wrong about it all."
4,good with a few drawbacks,postitive - works greatnegative - it's not an environmentally friendly soap and I'm pretty sure they test on animals.
2,IMPROPER PACKING FOR LIQUID ITEMS,I tried to purchase Dawn Direct Foam dishwashing foam in the 30.9 ounce size. The first shipment contained the original carton of 6 bottles packed on its side in an Amazon box. When I recieved the package all the bottles leaked due to the caps being loose and the bottles were lying on their sides. I requested a replacement item and epxlained the packing problems. The replacement shipment arrived in the same condition so I requested a refund and returned the merchandise. I strongly advise against purchasing this item on line.
3,"Great Soap, Lousy Packing","We love this soap but cannot find the refills in local stores, so we have resorted to Amazon. In the first shipment, one of the bottle lids was loose and half a bottle of soap had spilled out. The second time, one lid wasn't even on a bottle and the whole thing spilled. The box was saturated and dribbled soap from the mail truck through the house and back out to the garbage. What a MESS."
4,"Great soap, flawed boxing","Some electronic part of the dishwasher conked out, and as a consequence, I discovered this splendid soap. One pump in the sponge is sufficient. So applause for Dawn's chemists.Part of the dishwashing liquid business is getting it from the vat to the customer, though, and here Dawn can use some improvement. The refill six-pack arrived with a soapy interior. I unpacked all the bottles and rinsed them off, discovering that on one of them the cap had become partially unscrewed. So, I did not receive quite as many fluid ounces as I had expected.Perhaps the grocery stores have the same experience? That would explain why the refills are rare on the shelves."
2,Cheap headset,"This is a basic headset that started to have problems after a couple of months of heavy usage. The microphone ratchets up and down. That quickly became stripped and would not hold its position.The sound quality was OK and the cord is nice and long. However, the jacks were not well labeled and color coded, which makes it a guessing game when plugging-in with low light conditions."
1,this is a waste.....,"hey this one did not work properly... the speaker's sound quality was good when you use it to listen to music but whn you use it on the laptop to chat over messengers, the micrphone sucks.. the other side hardly hears u.. it irritates the other side because they hear a lot of noise.. i repent after buying this...."
1,Low Quality - Broken with little use,This product is cheaply constructed. One of the speakers keeps popping off and the microphone is broken. I hardly used the product. Get something more sturdy.
1,Absolutely horrible Mic (broke down in a little over a month),"I definitely do NOT recommend this headset if you're planning to use it for chatting (well of course you will, else why would you want the mic?).I bought this for use with my Skype Pro subscription and it just broke down on me today. I was in the middle of a job interview conversation so you can imagine how frustrating it can be. Initially I thought it was my Windows settings or my Skype settings but found out it was this infernal headset that was the root of the problem. Twisting it back and forth brought some life back, but alas that was ephemeral !Why do I give it one star ? That's because the headphones are decent sounding and music sounds soft with pretty decent bass.DO NOT BUY IT !"
4,totally satisfied,"I am using it with skype, and so far, the sound is very good from my point of view, people can hear me very well, and the wire is very long (that can be good and bad), you can manage the sound with a small remote on the wire, and from the computer, nothing to install, you just have to plug it."
4,Altec Lansing AHS322 - Pretty Good For The Price,"Reasonable cost, good sound, very acceptable headset. A little snug around the ears, but have not used for extended lengths. A couple of months now and it's still working ok."
1,anyone had this problem?,"I bought these 22 inch blades to replace blades on my 1991 Lincoln Town Car. According to Amazon they should work, but the pin on my blade arm will only go through the first hole (and that using a great deal of force). No way can I get the pin to go through the second hole. All demonstration videos on the web show these things sliding over the pins effortlessly. It's a large pin arm, but is there such a thing as an extra-large pin? Clearly this is a vintage car, but I don't want to keep buying blades that are supposed to fit my make and model and won't go on. I can find no info on this, but am now stuck with two blades I can't use (they got kind of dirty trying and trying to get those darn pins through the holes)."
4,Clean Wipe!,Just installed a week agoThe item arrived quickly (order a few days before christmas)Working in rain and snow
5,Wiper blades,"Great product. Great safe packaging. Quick arrival. No complaints, highly recommended. If anyone wants a good wiper blade, easy to install and does the trick, this is the one to go with."
4,Excellent replacement blades for my 2004 Prius,"I trusted the amazon ""this fits your vehicle"" tool and also one other reviewer that also bought this for their 2nd gen Toyota Prius. I purchased the 26"" for the driver side and the 18"" for the passenger side. Turns out that they fit really nicely. It actually takes a little more effort to remove the oem blades than to install these. You just need to look at the pictured instructions and snap them in the j-hooks and then clamp the locking cover down. They actually do look more simple and nice that the older design OEM ones. They are also super quiet and smooth. I'm hoping they last. I've old had them for less than a week. As some other reviewers noted, that the locking clip is plastic, so I'm not sure how long they will last. That's why I'd keep my rating to 4 stars.I hadn't experienced any vibrating or instability at highway speeds either."
1,"Bosch 4826 Evolution All-Season Bracketless Wiper Blade - 26""",the wiper leaves streaks on the windshield at the attachment point to the wiper arm. The shorter version for the other side of the windshield is fine. Packaging was fine. Mounting was simple and straightforward. Try a different brand for this length.
2,Bracketless blades disappoint,"I'm selecting this size, 26"" for review, even though I purchased a 19"" and 2-24"" blades. I thought I give these a try, and they all streak. More prominent in the 26"" blade. I'm thinking that without the brackets, the pressure is not even or constant throughout the stroke. I am not the engineer, I can't tell for certain. But, its hard to believe all four blades I purchased for use on two of my vehicles are streaking..Amazon Customer Service was great to immediately replace the 19 and 26"". But, the 26 is still streaking, though not as bad as the original set I ordered.I'd go back to traditional next time I replace.I only give it 2 stars and not 0 because its still better than nothing other than the streaks."
4,Bosch 4281 Evolution,"Product works great about 90% of the time but leaves some streaking occasionally. Overall, much better than previous blades and are worth the price. I would buy them again."
2,Not really for all-season,"Bosch wipers were on my car when I got it and not problems whatsoever, but I just didn't know what kind they were, but these weren't it. I put these one late October and when December hit and started getting to below freezing the wipers already started streaking. Needless to say I was disappointed on my purchase."
2,wrong information,I bought this.wipers following the information that fits MB W202 but when I instal it was to small than the original one!
1,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY,These do not conform to the windshield of my '12 Fusion properly. Unable to adjust to resolve issue - save your money and buy another brand.
3,Great for certain vehicles,"At first this blade worked very well, then a few days in I noticed it was streaking pretty badly coming back down my window shield, right where the blade connects to the frame. I thought it must be debris so I cleaned it and it didn't get any better. I thought well, maybe it needs to break it, or ""set in"" to fit my window better. Two weeks in, no such luck. It seems that the blade has an issue with not applying enough pressure where it mounts. Guess its back to the cheaper Bosch that have worked for me in the past."
5,Streak free,"So far these blades are great, no streaks and are quiet. Not sure how they will work in winter but work great in warm weather and I do recommend them."
1,Good wipers for a week.,"These wipers worked well for only a week.After 1 week, they started streaking. After 3-4 weeks they were smearing water.What a disappointment in Bosch products. I didn't believe the reviews and went on to purchase these. A big mistake.I would have taken them off quickly, but for a price I paid I couldn't force myself to discard these expensive wipers after a month.I now have Valeo wipers and they are great after 4+ month. They are also narrower than Bosch (look slicker).I will not buy Bosch wipers again."
4,Corvette & Trailblazer Application,"I bought these for my '99 Corvette and '02 Trailblazer. They still work great after a year in the wet Seattle weather. The only downside is on BOTH vehicles, the outer couple inches of the passenger-side blade does not make contact with the windshield when in the ""OFF"" position, as reported in a previous post. I was hoping after being on the either vehicle for a year, it would 'relax' and press against the windshield at rest. Not so. Maybe some more engineering needs to go into the product."
2,Unimpressed,"I bought these and the 21"" wipers after reading the reviews here on Amazon. I've had them for about a month. I'm from the deep South, so I can't attest to the damage from extreme cold weather problems that others have had. However, it has been very rainy here since I got them. They worked fine for about two weeks. Now, I can see lots of streaks where the wiper isn't making contact with the windshield. I followed the directions that came with the wipers and haven't done anything out of the ordinary to them.These wipers are kind of expensive, and I was expecting a lot more from them. I will not buy these again."
3,Not for ice/snow,"These are very quiet wipers and wipe well as long as the temp is above 32F. However, because they are low-profile with a wide backbone, they will accumulate un-melted ice and snow and will ride up on it as it wedges underneath the backbone thus streaking like crazy. Additionally, 'snapping' the wiper against the windshield doesn't always break the chunks off as they stick to the rubber to the point that I often need a tool to scrape the ice off the blade. Summer is coming, so they'll be fine till next winter when I'll look for something better."
2,The look deceives,"Pretty neat looking wipers. did not prove to be too efficient in New England, within the winter season they just fail to keep the windshield clean.Always some wetty spots remain.Stick to the standard would be my advice"
2,Not worth it,"They may look nice, but both wipers start leaving streaks a few weeks after I put them in. The Valeo 600 series are much cheaper and last longer. Apparently these are supposed to be good for snow/ice, since there is no bracket, it wouldn't be prone to freezing up. But that rarely happens anyway."
2,Won't work on my Volvo 850,"I read all the reviews of these blades, and even though some folks had problems with them, I decided to take the plunge as they looked like they would work well in snow and ice. I installed them on my 94 Volvo 850, replacing a set of worn Bosch conventional wipers. The new blades will simply not work on this car. Although I've never had a problem with previous blades and the spring tension on both blades is very good, these new blades do not contact the windshield in the middle portion of the blade. The blades are so stiffly curved that much of the blade remains above the glass, leaving most of the windshield unwiped. Guess I'll put on my old Bosch conventional blades, which have very little curvature. I can't comment on the longevity of the blades as I can't use them."
2,More like a De-Evolution,"Not worth the money. After about 2 months the wipers fell apart and started streaking very badly and this was before it even started snowing. Maybe the wipers reacted with the windshield washer fluid but I was totally unimpressed with this product. Your money is better spend buying standard wiper blades and replacing more often, no better mouse trap here."
2,Is it better to look good than be good?,"Not worth the money. After about 2 months the wipers fell apart and started streaking very badly and this was before it even started snowing. Maybe the wipers reacted with the windshield washer fluid but I was totally unimpressed with this product. Your money is better spend buying standard wiper blades and replacing more often, no better mouse trap here."
2,Not very durable for the money,"Not worth the money. After about 2 months the wipers fell apart and started streaking very badly and this was before it even started snowing. Maybe the wipers reacted with the windshield washer fluid but I was totally unimpressed with this product. Your money is better spend buying standard wiper blades and replacing more often, no better mouse trap here."
2,Not very good,"Not worth the money. After about 2 months the wipers fell apart and started streaking very badly and this was before it even started snowing. Maybe the wipers reacted with the windshield washer fluid but I was totally unimpressed with this product. Your money is better spend buying standard wiper blades and replacing more often, no better mouse trap here."
2,Do hold hold up well,"Not worth the money. After about 2 months the wipers fell apart and started streaking very badly and this was before it even started snowing. Maybe the wipers reacted with the windshield washer fluid but I was totally unimpressed with this product. Your money is better spend buying standard wiper blades and replacing more often, no better mouse trap here."
2,Does not last long,"Not worth the money. After about 2 months the wipers fell apart and started streaking very badly and this was before it even started snowing.

2,Did not hold up well,"Not worth the money. After about 2 months the wipers fell apart and started streaking very badly and this was before it even started snowing.

Your money is better spend buying standard wiper blades and replacing more often, no better mouse trap here."
2,Too costly for the service,"Not worth the money. After about 2 months the wipers fell apart and started streaking very badly and this was before it even started snowing. Maybe the wipers reacted with the windshield washer fluid but I was totally unimpressed with this product. Your money is better spend buying standard wiper blades and replacing more often, no better mouse trap here."
2,"Not so good, save your money","Not worth the money. After about 2 months the wipers fell apart and started streaking very badly and this was before it even started snowing. Maybe the wipers reacted with the windshield washer fluid but I was totally unimpressed with this product. Your money is better spend buying standard wiper blades and replacing more often, no better mouse trap here."
2,Great for about a month,"Simply put - started out great for the first month or so, then the streaks came, then the sounds of the rubber struggling to make it across the windsheild, and then progressively worse until I could say I completely regret buying these."
3,Low life expectancy,"Although these wipers work very well while new, I've gone through three sets between my two vehicles, and the story has been the same each time. They just don't last! After about 2-3 months, they start to streak and are all but worthless soon after that. I'm a big fan of Bosch products in general, but I'll be switching back to their Excel wiper blades. The performance is comparable, but the Excel lasts at least twice as long as the Evolution."
5,Good blades,"Bought this for my mothers 2004 Toy Camry (19"" and 24"") and they work well when compared the oem blades, they are very tight on the windshield and clear off water well, lets see how well they hold up."
5,Best blades ever!,"This is my second set of wiper blades from Bosch. They are great! No issues in rain, sleet, snow or freezing mixes. They last a long time. I paid $50 for these at the auto parts store so was very pleased w my amazon find :-)"
3,Only 1 Wiper,"I read the product description and a number of reviews. For some reason I failed to grasp this was only 1 wiper. Having previously bought all my wipers at garages, I assumed they came in pairs. I was wrong. If you need two wipers, you will need to order a set."
1,Disappointed,"These wipers are a huge disappointment. I put them on this summer. Sitting at a stoplight, they do a great job of wiping the windshield. But when you really need them, while driving in the rain, they lift off the windshield at speeds above 40 MPH.Now that it is winter, they freeze up the same or worse than a standard metal frame.I'm not sure what the advantage of these wipers is...save your money and stick with traditional wipers."
3,"works good, looks weird",I purchased this a month ago. I have always been satisfied with Bosch wipers. And this pair works just as great. The only reason I am giving it 3 stars only is that the connector is quite a big and it looks like nipples on my windshield.
5,These blades are great!,"It appears that those who are having issues with these blades are installing two of the same size blades. You should note that your car likely requires two different size wiper blades, with the longer of the two being on the drivers side. I think that's why some people get ""two inches of space that doesn't get wiped""I got these for my 2004 Camry and they are working great. Nearly silent and certainly no annoying shuddering noise with the windshield is dry like I was getting with my old blades. Its Bosch Evolution for me from now on."
5,Excellent fit for my 2009 Nissan Altima hybrid,"I got these for my 2009 Nissan Altima hybrid and they work perfectly. So much better than the ones that came on the car (we bought is used so who knows if they were even changed after the initial sale)! I can actually see out the windshield now.I'm a bit ashamed to say it took me like 15 minutes of sweating in the summer sun and leaning halfway over the front of my car to figure out how to take off the old blades and then put these on. So, good luck. :-)"
3,Not really an upgrade...,"I purchased these for my 2003 volvo s40 before the winter to replace the volvo wiper blades I had on before. While they worked great at first, I started to notice the driver side one starting to stick quite a bit whenever I just wanted to do one quick wipe (leaving lots of little bars of moisture on my window as it would catch and ""jump"" off the window). I had to use A LOT of windshield washer fluid to get it running smoothly again each time. These blades do not go well with rain-x washer fluid either, the blades would stick even more and would get clogged up with the rain-x product collecting all kinds of debris. Also, unless you wipe the blades down a lot you get lots of fine imperfect lines from the blades (at least as much as my old volvo blades). Bottom line is that they are just about as cheap on Amazon as my volvo blades, and work maybe slightly better."
3,"Bosch 22""","Installed on 2007 2500HD Chevy Silverado.The bosh wiper blades went on the very easily, took less than 5 minutes from start to finish.The only concern I have is the last inch of the right wiper blade does not make good contact with the windshield.Time will tell if the blade conforms to the glass."
5,Wife loves these wipers!,"I bought these wipers for my wifes car ford escape based on the positive reviews. She was the one that instigated the purchase of new wipers, however the first full week with the new wipers she texted me nearly every day telling me how much she loves the wipers. My wife highly recommends these wipers, in fact i'm going to buy some for my taurus right now!"
2,Don't last,"These work great but don't last any longer than the factory blades. In fact, these wore out faster on my corolla than the factory ones. I will be switching back to the factory blades."
4,Solid product,"Bracketless wiper blades should be the standard now and it would be nice if they were made more affordable but with cost aside, these are very easy to install and work well. I have purchased slightly better ones in the past but for the most part they're all the same and just add words like ""Evolution"" or ""Icon"" or something. Rain-X ones are equivalent and it's just a matter of cost versus brand in my opinion."
4,Easy Installiation,"So this is my first investment on the bracket less wiper its a good price spent 20 bucks for both of wipers wiped clean, no screeches picked up every drop of water without any problems. Id will report when they fail to do their job."
2,streaks,installed on my kia sportage. Installation was very easy. Wipers look good! But streaks after a few days. Very disappointed.
2,Not Impressed,"I recently installed 2 sets of these wipers on both my F150 and my wife's Explorer. After an ice storm and 2 snow storms we both decided these wipers are dissapointing at best. These contoured blades are supposed to maintain contact with the windshield in snowy conditions. Well, neither one of us found this to be true. We both spent more time on the side of the road, cleaning the ice/snow off of these, hoping they'd maintain contact with the glass. On my set, after a few times of banging the ice/snow off the blade, the little plastic covers kept opening up. I noticed when I removed these (only 4 weeks old) that 3 of the 4 covers were missing.Don't be fooled by their cleaner appearance or by their advertising, these are not worth the money."
2,"Worked well for about 2 months, not worth the cost","Not worth the money. After about 2 months the wipers fell apart and started streaking very badly and this was before it even started snowing. Maybe the wipers reacted with the windshield washer fluid but I was totally unimpressed with this product. Your money is better spend buying standard wiper blades and replacing more often, no better mouse trap here."
2,Good Styling Subpar Performance,"The styling on these wiper blades is really good. After 4 months of use, they are useless as wiper blades. If you don't mind replacing these 3 or more times a year then these would be great for you."
4,"Fantastic, invest in these!","One of the most important aspects about your car that probably never gets much attention to are the wipers. Quality wipers make all the difference between driving safely and dangerously. These wipers made by Bosch are some of the finest wipers I have used. They are bracketless, and because of that, I feel it hugs the window a lot better and removes more water quicker. They are made of quality materials, and work wonderfully. If you notice smudges when you using your wipers, or see cracks on them, it is time to change them. I would recommend you give these a try."
3,Works Good While It Lasts,Wish they lasted longer but winter takes a toll on them. Figure on replacing them once a year.
3,Works good while it lasts,Wish they lasted longer but winter takes a toll on them. Figure on replacing them once a year.
5,Excellent,"We paired this with the Bosch 4819 Evolution, and they are by far the best wiper blades we've ever had. Easy installation, no streaks, perfect functionality. We will never buy a different kind of wiper blades. Save yourself the trouble of looking around and just buy these."
5,blades lasted on my audi over a year!,just happy they last so long..well worth the price. buying on amazon saves over autozone and other places.
4,Wipes Clean! Remember to get 2!,The first thing is to remember you need to order 2 of these generally as they do not come as a set. This may be obvious to some but I forgot. The install took about 5 minutes and in the first few rainy days I've encountered they wipe very clean. I haven't had them long enough to know how well they hold up but so far they are great!
2,Not impressed,I thought these would be better than the $5 ANCO ones but they aren't. They are the same at best. Save your money and buy the cheapies.
1,overpriced junk,"I ordered 2 sets of 19""&22"" blades. Both 22"" ones looked like they were used and were missing the locking pin kits. They were very difficult to install and various plastic parts were getting broken and distorted in the process. Once I had a pair installed, neither fit correctly at all. Both had large areas that did not even get close to touching the windshield. They are cheap all plastic, junk. This was my first Amazon lemon purchase. The only thing good is the Amazon return policy. I bought regular blades locally (AutoZone) for $7 & $8 that are much simpler and work fine. My suggestion: Don't be part of this Bosch ripoff."
1,stopped working after 2 weeks,This worked well for 2 weeks. Now leaves streaks right in my line of vision so I can't see. Very disappointed.
1,Smeared Windshield From Day 1,"Smeared windshield from day one. Has not gotten worse, but not better either. Normal windshield dirtiness, not greasy, etc.; in other words a normal windshield under normal circumstances. I'll not purchase again."
1,Horrible Product,The wiper blade never worked from the beggining. It was barely 2 months into service and it started making.horrible screeching noises leaving streaks on the windshield. This simply doesn't work for 2010 Honda Civic.
3,"Bosch 4822 Evolution All-Season Bracketless Wiper Blade, 22","Bosch 4822 Evolution All-Season Bracketless Wiper Blade, 22I watched many ads on TV and read a lot of reviews, but I was disappointed with these wiper blades. Mostly because they tend to squeek and drag on the windshield in light rain. Not a lot, but more than I would expect from this supposed calibur and price blade. I don't know about others, but smooth running, quiet blades are priority 1 to me."
4,Great Product,Stays on all parts of the window. Very easy to install. Much better then normal wipers. Will be buying another pair when second car needs them.
2,Winter is coming... Use blades that can handle it.,"I bought these blades for both of our cars (blade sizes ranging from 17"" to 24"") in December of last year to prepare for winter, and they worked fine during the unseasonable rain (warm winter here in the Chicago area). However, with the first decent snow, the wipers were useless. They had no structural integrity, and just bounced around the snow clumps sticking to the windshield. Even with the heat on full bore and the snow melting on contact, the blades just clumped themselves up with the snow packed up from the shuddering and bouncing. It was probably the most terrifying winter drive I've ever experienced. Not happy, and will not be buying these again. I generally use these Rain-X blades for winter, and will likely do so again this year:Rain-X 5074956 Winter Wiper Blade, 24"" (Pack of 1)"
5,"Works great, very quiet","I bought these right before a set of storms hit here on the west coast, and couldn't be happier. Completely streak-free, and amazingly quiet -- I guess I had grown accustomed to the noise my old blades had been making. Easy to install, after just a quick glance at the instructions to get a vague idea of what to do it only took 5 minutes (and I'm no expert). Would definitely buy these again."
2,Don't Contour Well to Windshield,They seemed nice at first but don't contour well to the windshield. Also didn't last very long in the Texas heat.
1,Terrible,Snow and ice stick to the blade and they don't conform to the window. I definitely would not purchase these again.
1,Worse than the old wipers I replaced,"These are by far the worst wipers I have ever purchased. I went with Bosch based on thier reputation for solid engineering and recommendation from several reviews here. This is clearly a product where the balance between form and function took a heavy bias toward form and ignored function. I installed these on my 2007 Accord and found they worked WORSE than my cheap wipers from a local retailer that were a year old. They do not contact the windshield with enough pressure to get a clean swipe and leave streaks in both rain, slush, and snow. I called Amazon and asked for an RMA to return...unfortunately it went several weeks without rain/snow here and I'm outside of normal return window. Disappointed in both Amazon and in Bosch."
1,Stick with MicroEdge,"Decided to purchase Bosch's new Evolution Wiper Blade for my BMW X5 and it does not work! It is made of a new plastic composite which supposedly matches the curve of the windshield - but it stays slightly raised in the center portion and leaves a large smear - right in the drivers center field of vision. Gave it 2 weeks hoping it would ""settle in"" and match the windshield curve - but it did not. Returned it to Amazon and ordered the traditional Bosch Microedge wiper blade and that worked fine!. What a hassle - next time will buy locally!"
4,Bosch on Taco,"Purchased a pair of these to replace the original blades on my 08 Tacoma. I like the fact that it is bracketless and do not have pressure points. It forms to the windshield well. We have not had much of a winter/rain, but so far no issues with these blades. I hope for them to last as long or longer than the stock blades. Time will tell. Install was easy and simple."
2,"Work well, but don't clean the outer edges of the windshield","I bought a set of these blades for my '09 Pontiac Solstice GXP. I guess my windshield is curvier than that of most other cars, because the outer inch and a half or so these blades does not make contact with the glass at all.I would have probably given these 4 or 5 stars if it weren't for this problem: the blades clean the glass cleanly and effectively, and don't make any noise even on a completely dry windshield."
2,Streaky and Noisy,"This blade and its 22"" counterpart wipe about half the water off the windshield. The other half remains as streaks and the glare (especially at night) can be blinding. All the while, the blades sound like a pushbroom on a shop floor. I washed my car and had the same problem. I replaced them with my friend's PIAA blades and THOSE worked just fine. I'm giving these 2 stars instead of 1 star because the best part about them was that they did not damage my windshield.Do. Not. Buy."
2,Not worth the money,I thought I would try these wiper blades as they are supposed to be better than the regular blades. They were great for about two months but they have recently started streaking pretty badly. They also pass over a pretty substantial portion of the windshield and leave that area wet and difficult to see through. Very dissapointing as I bought these for the winter and will most likely have to replace them as the snow season is just beginning.
3,Easy Install But Slightly Defective,"I have an Old '91 BMW 318i. Very easy install. THe problem however, is that the right edge of the right wiper (about half an inch) does not firmly press against the window. The water does not get wiped in the area it covers. Since its a small area, on the passenger side, and easy to live with (plus I live in the land of little rain)I didn't send em back."
3,good product bad packaging,"Definitly just the product it's a high quality item look good and I hope with the time my concept about it dont change,in the other hand the packaging it's a disaster I buy two of this and I received two packages when perfectly fit in just one wich means that I had to pay extra charge for the shipping"
3,"Good, but not for my car","This blade generally did a good job.However, it didn't work as well as the standard wiper blade on my particular car: a W124 Mercedes E300, which has the single eccentric-path windwhield wiper. It left two sections that consistently smeared right in the center of each side of the glass. It just doesn't seem to apply enough downward pressure in the right spots to work with this type of wiper system.I'm sticking with Bosch but going back to the old-style (and cheaper) bracketed wiper blade."
5,windshield wipers,The wipers are working great! Much better than regular ones that are listed for Saabs in auto places.
2,Spend you money wisely!,"I had Bosch wipers before (premium version) and thought that these would be the same. WRONG! While it wipes fine, they are not as long as it states. Example: on my 17"" wiper they have 1"" shorter wiping area than my previous ones, on my 24"" wiper it was about 1.5"" shorter thank other one. The wiper is 17"" or 24"" long as stated, but the wiping area is much shorter. They also have thin rubber wiper itself, it works but I think they will not last as long. For this price or just little more you can find a better wiper."
2,Pay few extra $ and get premium wipers,"I had Bosch wipers before (premium version) and thought that these would be the same. WRONG! While it wipes fine, they are not as long as it states. Example: on my 17"" wiper they have 1"" shorter wiping area than my previous ones, on my 24"" wiper it was about 1.5"" shorter thank other one. The wiper is 17"" or 24"" long as stated, but the wiping area is much shorter. They also have thin rubber wiper itself, it works but I think they will not last as long. For this price or just little more you can find a better wiper."
5,Excellent,"Work well, look nice and look like they'll last (they've been on for about 4-6 months now). Of course, there was a rebate on them when I bought them and I forgot to send it in :( :( Good purchase overall. A bit pricey, but worth it."
5,Absolutely wonderful,By far the best wiper blades I've ever had. Simple to install. Stop looking for others and buy these.
5,Best Yet,"So far the Bosch Evolution All-Season Bracketless are the best replacement wipers I have ever bought. No Steeks, No bouncing, No noise. A smooth clean sweep every time. I like so much I bought them for my sisters car to. Be sure to get the right size. To my surprise, my 2002 Honda Accord has the same size as My sisters 2006 Susuki Forenza. 22"" driver and 19"" passanger. I hope they last a long time."
5,I can see clearly now...,"What a difference, these things are great.I gotta figure out if they are refillable?"
3,Not any better than conventional wiper blades,"I was having problems with my car's original wiper blades during the winter because there would be entire sections of my windshield where the precipitation wouldn't wipe away. I bought these wiper blades thinking that they would solve the problem. However, there isn't any notable improvement whatsoever. The next time I am shopping for wiper blades, I will save the money and buy conventional wiper blades."
2,Much shorter that stated...,"I had Bosch wipers before (premium version) and thought that these would be the same. WRONG! While it wipes fine, they are not as long as it states. Example: on my 17"" wiper they have 1"" shorter wiping area than my previous ones, on my 24"" wiper it was about 1.5"" shorter thank other one. The wiper is 17"" or 24"" long as stated, but the wiping area is much shorter. They also have thin rubber wiper itself, it works but I think they will not last as long. For this price or just little more you can find a better wiper."
4,Enormous shipping Boxes,"If you buy 2 blades, you get 2 enormous Boxes with 1 blade in each box.Shame on AMAZON :-("
3,Doesn't last very long,"I've had these for about 1.5 yrs, and they're pretty much done. I live in southern California, where I don't use them that much. It seems pretty short for a life cycle, doesn't it?"
4,Wiper Review,While I've only had rain twice since I bought them the wipers seem todo a very good job. Shipping is another thing. The cost was over $11.00and the were shipped seperately. The two boxes they came in would nothave fit in the trunk of my Pontiac Bonneville. The boxes and packingweighed much more than the wiper blades. I did not save any money dueto shipping charges. I could have bought locally for the same cost orless.
3,"Chinese wipers, where will it end?","I purchased two sets, one for my Toyota tundra, and one for my VW Jetta, They wipe cleaner and match the windshield contour better on the tundra, and are comparable to other high end wipers. I was disappointed to see that they are made in CHINA. I had hoped for better from Bosch. If they are made cheaper, why don't they sell for less?"
4,CLEAN,"These bracketless wipers have a clean look and clean windshields well. I have these on my E-Class Mercedes, Chevy Trailblazer, Cadillac Seville, and C-5 Corvette. They've worked extremely well since they were installed a year ago and exposed to all kinds of inclement weather. The only down side is the 22"" on the Cadillac and Corvette do not make contact with the windshield when in ""off"" position; hence, only 4 stars. Otherwise, highly recommended for blades 20"" and under."
5,The best wiper blades I have tried. Amazing.,Got tired of buying $4.00 wipers every 3 months. These were $15.00 but what a difference. Highly recommended.
4,Work well so far,"Purchased 19"" and 18"" blades for a 2009 Ford Focus and they work well. Time will tell if they hold up for at least a year."
2,Doesn't worth the price,"Bought 24 and 19 inchers for my Honda. They worked just like any other wind shield wipers, and after a year they started to leave smudges and needed to be replaced just like any other windshield wipers. That's the problem, they cost much more then any other windshield wipers but work just like any windshield wipers. So get them if you don't mind payin extra for fancy looking windshield wipers that do same thing and last same time."
4,working well so far,I had Valeo bracketless wipers before which worked well but are more expensive. The Bosch ones look the same and clean just as good so far. Valeo wipers lasted about 3 years.
1,Don't Fit Audi,I bought these for an Audi (2002 A6). Audi has a different design for attaching and these don't work. They are a conventional design. The Adviser on the Amazon page said they would work.
3,Clip doesn't stay closed,"The wipers seem to work fine, but the little clip that covers the attaching area (which makes it look much cleaner kept flipping open in the wind. I tried numerous time to keep it closed, but I ended up having to glue it down. Therefore it's not constructed as well as it could be."
5,Great wiper for extented travel,Bosch Evolution wiper is a great wiper for long extended travel from civilization or a local auto parts. This wiper is at home in adverse conditions. Great in mud and dirt. Highly recommended.
4,Works well but does not settle well on passenger side,Bought two and the one for the driver side sits perfectly on the windshield and works exceptionally good. Some problem on the driver side. Blade does not touch the windshield in the middle and a wet patch is left every time. Not sure how to fix this. I'll try switching the blades.
2,Doesn't conform to the window,"I bought these based on reviews and the sleek look - most wipers have a lot more hardware used to keep the wiper pressed to the windshield. My windshield is fairly flat, but these wipers won't keep in contact with it, leaving lots of streaks."
5,Easy to install,"I purchased these according to the reviews, and the reviews were right. Very easy to install for my car, just snapped it on the j-hook. Wipers are VERY QUIET and hugs the windshield very well. Wipes clean throughout the length of the blade."
3,Squeaking Noise,"I purchased this item 20 days ago. When I installed this item onto my car and used it in a rain, there was no problem. However, when the newly installed wipers sweeped up the screen in a SNOWY weather yesterday, there were annoying squeaky noises all the way while I was driving. It snowed not that much. I guess the problem might be that the blade is not suitable for some cold temperature range like yesterday's 15F. I'm a little disappointed with this result, but I'm not sure whether I will have to make wiper blades be at proper angle or leaning. Actually, it seems that there's nothing I can adjust to reduce the noise."
2,It is not so good as Trico NeoForm,"Very non-resistant to the dirt. Constantly I had to clean dust and dirt from the rubber, otherwise wipers remained the band. After a short time the band remained even on cleaned rubber. It looked like rubber was deteriorated. I user them on Toyota Corolla 2009. Trico NeoForm is better."
5,Work well,"These work well - installed them just before a 2000 mile trip in mostly rain and they worked very well both in heavy rain and light mist. No streaks, no chatter, and no problem with wind. My previous wiper blade would tend to lift off the windshield a bit at high speeds. I'm not sure if it's from the beam design of these blades or what, but they worked well at all speeds.They were very easy to install, I nearly needed a hammer to get my last set of blades on and off, but these snapped right on easily."
4,"Work nicely, but maybe a little expensive","Work great, but if you have to replace them on all your cars once or twice a year, it starts adding up. I would be happier if they were $5 or less."
2,"Great Wipers, Worth the extra $2","Being from Michigan the one thing we need is good wipers on our vehicles. I can say that I have always bought middle of the road wipers for our cars. I ususally spend about $20 at the local Walmart or Meijer for a buy one get one free. But when I saw this deal I grabbed them up. These wipers do retial in the store for $17 a piece so it is basically BOGO. It rained for the first time since I put them on and they work great. I have not used them in the snow yet so i will update my review later.UPDATE: These wipers are awful! A little snow in Michigan and they are ruined. I am not sure if there was a carbon film or layer on the blade, but I wiped them clean and they are ruined! Not sure what I did, but I already had to get new ones. I take back my review. I would not spend the extra $2 on these anymore. Buyer beware..."
4,Bosch 4821 Evolution wiper,"I have Wolksvagen Passat B5 2004 year. This wipers fit to my car ideally. I used this wipers about month, it was normal, no lines at windshield and no noises at rainy days. But in snow when temperature under 30F noises appeared!So I don't recommend to use this wipers in snow regions. But in my country there is no much snow in winter, thats why I like this wipers."
2,Disappointing performance,"I thought I would give Bosch another try, even though my past experience with their wipers has been less than satisfying.The Ford OEM wipers are >$20, so $11 wipers seemed like a better idea and since it's been a few years since I last tried Bosch, maybe they've improved. The old wipers I had on the car were pretty shredded, so the initial performance of the Bosch was very good. Unfortunately, as soon as the Bosch are exposed to any environmental debris: leaves, general schmutz, etc., they begin to streak. These have about a dozen lines after about 2 weeks of being on the car, right at eye level, natch. Cleaning them doesn't help at all.This is about on par with past experience with Bosch, so back to the Motorcraft wipers. You do get what you pay for."
4,Great wipers,Very easy to install and very sleek! I like how they were all rubber or plastic and did not contain any metal parts. Very good item! Highly recommend it!
4,"Chatters some, but no streaking","The wipers clean the window great, and seem to be fine at highway speeds, but they flex more than metal-frame ones and chatter at the end of every stroke, which is getting kind of annoying."
3,"Fantastic wiper, Made in China","I deducted (2) stars because this product was made in China, whereas other Bosch windshield wiper products are manufactured in Germany or Belgium. Amazon should start listing this information. However, if country-of-origin doesn't matter to you as a consumer, read on.Bracketless wiper means the rubber blade is not suspended in the ubiquitous metal frame. The blade is attached to a strong yet flexible length of plastic with a bulb in the center to hook your wiper. Unlike traditional wipers, the dual springs keep the blade real taut -- the whole wiper is bowed out of the package -- and it hugs the surface of the window evenly its entire length. Wiper action is butter smooth and quiet, zero streaking.Good spring/summer/fall wiper. Stick to a metal bracketed wiper for ice and snow where this sort of product does not perform well. In anything other than rain or light snow I give it (2) stars."
2,Not worth it,"I have a Honda Accord and these wipers were easy to install. For the first few weeks, the wipers worked well. However, after a few weeks they streaked terribly even after being cleaned. I tried Rain-Ex on the windshields to see if the streaking would decrease, but nothing worked. These wipers are not worth the price."
4,Works well and doesnt shutter,"Clears in one swipe both snow and rain. Great product, the price is the only reason i gave it a 4. I totally recommend these though. I will try and remember to review in a year to say whether they are still good."
1,VERY Undurable product,"I bought 2 of these last November. After less than 2 months of use, both of them had streak all over. I park my car in the garage at home and at work. There was no direct sunlight to the blades but they still worn out in 2 months. VERY UNDURABLE product. Will never buy Bosch again!!"
3,Wouldn't fit wiper arm,"I purchased this 28"" blade to replace the outrageously expensive 32"" blade on my motorhome. However, this blade did not fit the larger J-Hook arm on the motorhome so I had to return it. I have this type of blade on my other vehicles and love them."
1,Worked well for about 1 week,"After a week's use on my Subaru Forrester, streaking became so bad I had to replace them. Tried several adjustments and cleaning to no avail."
3,This size is TOO BIG for Hyundai 2006 Santa Fe LE,"My car is the Hyundai Santa Fe. This product says 24"" fits this car. That is a lie. I double checked with Sears Auto Care, and only 20"" or 22"" fits. This blade does the job, but if you look closely, it is hanging 2"" off the side of the windshield. It feels shoddy, but the water is cleansed off very efficiently. Another downside is it makes a clunking noise everytime the 2"" overhang leaves the edge of the windshield. When you are driving for a while in rain, that clunking sound will come out a LOT, in an irritable way. Also, this is only one blade. I expected a pair, but they didn't explicitly say only one is for sale here. I'm glad, so that I can get the other one safely from Sears instead. I hope that if I move the 24"" blade from the passenger seat side to the driver seat side, then there will be no more clunking noise and it will fit just barely right. However, it has to be 22"" for the passenger side, unless you can bear that noise."
2,Does NOT fit 2005 A6 3.2,"Although I found these through the car selection tool - and re-ran it again to double-check - they do not fit a 2005 Audi A6 3.2 Quattro.I took the rubber out and exchanged it for the old ones. Quite some work, but they do work fine now. (That is why 2*)"
2,Great.... for the sections that get wiped.,"I purchased these blades because of the excellent reviews. I live in an area where it doesn't snow so I figured they would be great here. I received the blades and put them on my 06 Dodge Stratus. They are very quiet and don't streak; however, they leave a good chunk of the windshield untouched. I don't how normal it is but it's pretty disappointing for what are supposed to be quality blades."
1,DOES NOT FIT AUDI A6 2.7T ON OEM WIPERS!!!,"Despite what Amazon's fitment matching says, this will not work on the special wipers for 2003 Audi A6 2.7T (noted in A6 owner's manual as ""Type B""). Check your wipers and your owner's manual to confirm, as Audi has used different types of wipers on the A6 models. The blade itself doesn't seem all that special, either. Typical blade design."
3,"Ok, not as good as Valeo","I have used Valeo for years. The OEM for Cadillac, Mercedes, etc. The first ones available I think. Anyhow, they had a discount on these so I tried one Valeo & one Bosch. The Valeos last me about two years, the Bosch only one. Valeo wins hands down, plus the Bosch started wiping more poorly about a month ago, I have had it less than a year."
4,Nice Wipers,"Been using it for 2 months, so far and it works great in heavy rain and snow. My other car has a similar Michelen bracket-less blades, but I think the Bosch blades work much better in snow due to its heavier and more sturdy construction."
1,garbage after less than 1 month,"2005 Tahoe -after a few short weeks they need to be replaced, the blades are very inferior constant streaking in the slightest of rain.the smallest ice or snow and you get massive streaking.rear window (16 inch) absolutely horrible..... about 12 inches actually contacts rear window....front passenger side (22 inch) misses due to curve of window and blade not being able to flex to it.my initial impression was that these where very good wipers until the back one arrived and the front ones started failing at only two weeks old.I would not buy these again and I am buying traditional wipers immediately."
1,Doesn't wipe in the middle area,"i bought this for my Grand Marquis and install it as the instructions and i tested it, it doesn't wipes the middle area and i don't know why"
2,Chatter,I bought these hoping that being Bosch wipers they would perform. Unfortunately they chatter way too much and I missed the return window from Amazon or they would be going back. I highly recommend the Rain X Latitude blades. Easy install and they move effortlessly across the glass.
2,Poor Quality,"These worked great for about a day. Now, after about a week there seem to be tears in the rubber and they streak across the entire windshield."
4,Very GOOD wiper,This wiper is very effective.No smudge...no residue. Windshield is cleareven in heavy rain.Easy to install.Very pleased with performance.
5,Bosch 4822 Evolution wiper Blade,"It feels so good to drive around and not hear the wipers make annoying noises, and when it wipes, it leaves no smears. These are a great investment. I'll remember to replace the wiper rubber and not the whole blade."
3,"Tried it out, it's ok","I wanted to try this blade based on it's reviews, but I didn't want to try it on the drivers side first (sounds weird but I'm particular about wiper blades so i bought my regular one for the drivers side & this one for the passenger to see how it did...this way if it sucked at least i can see properly out the drivers side...especially with winter I need to see!). It wipes fine but man - what a racket! it makes so much noise it reminded me of those big boat cars from the 80's and that BRRRRRRRT noise you'd get from those crappy wipers. If you can handle the noise you're probably fine. I can't though lol"
4,Clear sailing,"They're windshield wipers and how much more can and needs to be said other than they do the job well, the price was good, they were especially easy to install and I can see, I can see!"
5,Awesome contact,Using on a 2004 VW Golf/GTI. Superb replacement to OEM. Great bar design does indeed track flush against the windscreen making for a clean swipe every time. No longer dealing with the blades with brackets of 4 contact supports which often lead to streaking as the blade aged (and suggest leading to premature replacement.) Yet to see how much longer they last as a result but much better clearing performance out of the gate. Worth the $$ difference to upgrade.
4,Good but not long sustainable,"It has good performance from the first installation.But after several months, it worn out, so I had to change as a new one.The only problem is sustainability."
2,they don't last very long...,"i bought these in mid june of 2011. its now the end of september and they only smear the water. the car is outside during the day, but parked inside every night. they worked great at first (used on a 2003 passat), but started to lose their worth in under two months. at three months they have to be replaced."
4,Works Pretty Good,I have had these now for 3 weeks and im fairly satisfied with them. They are quite and they clean the windshield without streaks. I had the RainX Longitude wipers previously that I purchased as WalMart. The Bosch are 10x better and are cheaper in price. Try'em out.
3,"Subpar wipers for the price, missing parts too","Bought 4 of these wipers for my two cars. They work ok, however on one, the last 1.5"" of the passenger-side wiper blade doesn't completely touch the windshield until the wiper wipes past half the windshield. Also while I didn't need them, the additional bracket adapter was missing on 3 of the 4 wipers. So if you need that, you're out of luck."
1,Poor materials,"I purchased these wipers for a 1999 Honda Accord. For the price I thought I was getting a premium product. Both the left and right wipers had defective materials. While installing the pin to secure the wiper, the plastic pin just bent in the housing and did not go through the outer housing. On the right wiper, the housing cracked while I was securing the blade to the arm. I was able to get the blades secured to the arms but they do not clear the windshield without any streaks. I have an e-mail to Amazon to request a refund!! Looking at the packaging it had a 2007 date and I am wondering now if they are old defective wipers. DO not waste your money on these."
3,Suzuki SX4 wagon,"This isn't too bad of a wiper. I've had it on for about a week, and it does stick to the window better then the traditional wipers. As with any wiper, you need to keep your windshield clear and clean (I use Invisible Glass). It is quite, and even at higher speeds (80) it clears the windshield well. I have yet yo test it out in snow and ice, which is why I went with this one, but from my experience so far, it should do fine.The price is a draw back. I like to change my wipers every 3 months, but this is a little too much for that. Still, when you consider how important visibility is when driving, a few extra dollars might make the difference between driving safely or being a hazard on the road. The extra $$ is hard to part with, but it is worth it for the add confidence I will be able to see while driving."
3,Becareful on your shipping,"On the item says ""eligible for FREE Super Saver Shipping"" but when you check out, it won't let you choose. Customer service say it's a mistake there. These item can't have Free shipping. So they off me $20 off for 2days shipping. But still I have to pay another $20 for shipping. Sorry, it's cheaper to buy it at my local shop. So disappointed that they not able to offer me free shipping for their own mistake"
2,Great for a a few months only,"It was great for a few months only, after 6 months of use, it started to develop a streak on the driver's side. I switched it with the passenger side and will see how long it will last for.I am not impressed with the reliability of this blade.Next time I will try a different brand."
2,"Good quality, doesn't work on my 07 Accord","These are well-built (made in China though, not like previous Bosch from Europe), they seem to be long-lasting and streak free, but the 26"" left a HUGE swath of my windshield uncleared on my '07 accord. The 18"" works great though."
2,Need Prescription Glasses,"Purchased these Feburary of this year and have had ample time driving in the rain/snow with these wipers.The 26"" wiper blade rubber is either too hard or the arch is too stiff. As a result, only the edges of the blade clear water. Unfortunately the entire middle of the blade just smears the water across the windshield. I've sometimes had to drive looking out either the top or bottom left hand corner of my windshield. The smear is so uncomfortable, that I feel it is affecting my normal vision and I may soon need to wear glasses to correct for the bluriness.However I've noticed on longer drives that the wiping/smearing gets better. On my hour long morning commutes to work, I find that the wipers perform decently by the end of my trip. Thus, pleasant and not an issue after some 45 minute break in period. But if you are like me, you might find that first 45 minute period to be excrutiatingly frustrating.Of note, shorter lengths perform pretty well."
2,Streaking,"My buddy works at a local car dealership and he purchased me a set of Bosch Wiper Blades, so this time I decided to order them myself. Well, my passenger side wiper streaks and it's only been installed for 2 weeks. Not impressed at all. My buddy must have purchased a different ""type/model"" from Bosch, because the ones he bought for me were exceptional.On the other hand, there may be a chance that the wiper size isn't accurate, and if I were to buy a blade 1 - 2"" shorter, it would properly rest itself against the windshield and not streak.Final word - buy with caution."
1,Disappointed with performance,"I bought a pair to replace my windshield wipers which were very worn out. Tried to find the Goodyear Assurance wipers at first but they were not available in a 28 inch length. Ended buying Bosch because of brand reputation. It worked well for the first two months but performance dropped significantly thereafter -----too much streaking. I noticed that this wiper was made in China. In the past, Bosch wipers were made in Europe."
2,Unimpressed,"I bought these and the 22"" wipers after reading the reviews here on Amazon. I've had them for about a month. I'm from the deep South, so I can't attest to the damage from extreme cold weather problems that others have had. However, it has been very rainy here since I got them. They worked fine for about two weeks. Now, I can see lots of streaks where the wiper isn't making contact with the windshield. I followed the directions that came with the wipers and haven't done anything out of the ordinary to them.These wipers are kind of expensive, and I was expecting a lot more from them. I will not buy these again."
3,1 Works great the other one doesn't...,"Purchased this set of wiper blades for my Honda Accord LX 2007... the 26"" blade has a problem. It seems to leave a 4-5"" area uncleaned when it wipes the windshield. I think it needs to have more tension or something in the assembly. Amazon is going to send me a return label and refund. If you do order a Bosch item it's probably best to order the ICON Model from them since it's a little better."
1,Not worth the money,Started streaking after two months of use. Would never buy this product again. Do not waste your money on a substandard product.
3,Works but doesn't last,They went on easy and when they were new they were great. After a couple months the started streaking and became very noisy.
4,AWESOME!!!!!,"These wipers work better than any others I have ever used! A must have for heavy rain! Also, help get the country bugs off of your windshield, even if they are plastered on there."
4,Good wipers.,"The wipers went on easily and appear to be working well. They have a slim profile, not nearly as large as the ones I replaced. Haven't had a real hard rain yet, but actually looking forward to putting them through the paces."
2,It was good for 6 months.,and then it started to squeak on both dry and wet surfaces like you do not believe it. My old wipers did not squeak at least when it was wet.
3,E Charger,"Once you get the hang of it, the plane really takes off! You can run to keep up with it so it doesn't get lost in the trees (not a problem in an open field) which is good exercise. I don't know how many crashes it will endure before breaking. The biggest drawback is waiting 2 minutes in between charges so you don't burn out the charger. The flight doesn't last that long, so you have to bide your time until you can charge it again. My son tends to lose interest waiting."
5,This is a geat toy,"I bought this thinking alright, for $... it will crash and burn. NOT AT All! This was probally one of the funnest toys I have ever purchased plus it doesn't brack the first time using it! Hours after hours of rechagable fun! You have to buy!"
3,"Limited fun, a little underwhelming","The engine on this toy is great. I mean, you know it generates a decent amount of thrust.However, this plane is an overweight glider. It doesn't have good gliding characteristics, which are important, because the engine though good cannot counteract the weight.Basically, this thing will fly up when you throw it and dive down quickly. The engine doesn't pick up the plane and keep it in the air. Thats if it can fly straight, otherwise it banks left and crashes."
2,This toy is fun but ...,"This toy breaks really easily. When you know how to fly it, it works really well. The secret to flying this plane is to throw it with the wind and softly. If you have an upstairs, you can throw it out the window. That works best."
4,pirty good,"my favorite review out of the bunch here is from the one who said ""because of the nose-wheight it will fall nose first when we release it from hand."" DUH! your not suppose to! surlly you dont think that it will just ""fly out of your hand""!! your suppse to THROW it, not just let go and expect it to fly like on the commercial!so encourage yourself to answer an EASY question- ""To fly- or not to fly, that is the question.) YOU choose."
1,It will not fly. Not worth to buy.,It is better not to buy this product. It will not fly. Because of weight it nosedives the moment we release from hand.It is not worth to buy. Only the propeller works.
2,Global Warming a hoax? Maybe or maybe not. This DVD is a hoax.,"Just read the product description. You will quickly discover the bias toward Dr. Beisner. If you are still up for it, watch the intriquing debate and you will discover how Gushee is often called on time while Beisner is able to further his thoughts. Also, an objective observation will reveal that the two sides have many points that they agree on."
3,Very slow & painful to get through,"I was very impressed by how neutral the presentation was. To the point that the case for global warming was suppressed, and the poor guy trying to debate against it given free reign. Other than that- it was dry & difficult to get through. Everything else I've seen on the subject was better."
3,Overpriced,"They wear out too quickly. Very expensive for for the service you get from them. If I find others that fit, I wn't buy these again."
5,fantastic book!!!....treasure trove of investment ideas,This book is a must read as you will pick up many many investment strategies. I read the book cover to cover in 2 days and wrote down several ideas which am now incorporating in my trading strategy. It has made me a lot more $$$ than what I paid for the book.Definitely worth every penny!
2,Very disappointed,I was disappointed in this book because the format is too small to do the art justice. Such a beautiful book with wonderful information should have been published in a larger format. Difficult to see the detail.
