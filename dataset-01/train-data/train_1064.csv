3,The Story of Ireland,"My interest in ireland, prompted me to get this book on my e-reader; it was an interesting read and gave me some deeper insight nto Ireland than I had previously had."
4,Corelle Hoops Serving Bowl,"really completes the Hoops set, they are beautiful, 3 sizes, they are heavy though, not what we are use to with Corelle"
3,SOLID AND PROFESSIONAL DARK SUSPENSE,"...from the ever popular What's-Happened-To-The-Children category. Don't expect a lot of action fireworks, as this is a fairly subtle and subdued work, one that cross-hatches Marasco's BURNT OFFERINGS with any of Ira Levin's paranoid thrillers."
4,A Description of Actual Events That Reads Like a Novel,"Much of the early portion of the book consists of Father Greeley's ""State of The Church"" address. While it might be somewhat difficult to make your way through this portion, doing so helps place the remainder of the book in context. Father Greeley presents very interesting timeline of the events leading up to the death of John Paul II. The timeline continues through the funeral, conclave and the election of Benedict XVI. Thoughout the timeline, Father Greeley presents his personal thoughts and comments about the various events included in the timeline.Ultimately, Father Greeley is once again successful in producing historical events in a manner that reads like a very interesting novel. The book will satisfy those looking for both the broad sociological message and the political intrigue related to death of John Paul II and election of Benedict XVI."
4,Excellent Evaluation of the Modern Church,Andrew Greeley has excellent insight in the problems of the modern Roman Catholic Church. He once again demonstrates that with this book.
4,An eclectic assortment of humorous and disturbing stories,"Reading Strange Days could best be described as flipping through story ideas for Twilight Zone. Divided into four sections, the editors of the Fortean Times have collected the most unusual, but true stories they could find. I found myself laughing and gasping more loudly as I turned each page. As a side note, this book is published in England so all us Americans shoulf be ready to try and convert all the measurments from the metric system. :-)"
1,Broken,"These earrings looked great and I really liked them but in less than a month, the posts broke completely off and the earrings are now completely useless."
2,Not quite what I expected.,"I chose these earrings because of the yellow and white gold combo. They felt quite flimsy when I got them. I do like a lightweight earring, but not a flimsy one. The studs on these are not attached as firmly as I would like. One has already come off. They are however very pretty. The quality was just not what I expected."
1,Garbage!!!,"I bought these earrings as a gift for my sister and the first time she wore them the post fell off. I felt like the biggest loser. When I contacted Amazon, they said that because it was over 2 months that I had bought the earrings I couldn't return them. What a rip off. These earrings don't even deserve 1 star."
1,Wouldn't buy again :(,"When I opened the package and inspected the posts, I noticed that one post was already falling off. They are very cute earrings but not made of high quality. I guess you get what you pay for."
3,Not great as a general-purpose dice roller,"I bought it to use alongside a boardgame, so that we didn't have to roll the dice on the table where they tend to knock things over or land in drinks. After a few games, we decided it wasn't practical. It's quite loud. It takes 10 or 15 seconds to stop spinning and let the dice settle after you push the bubble, which can drag out each turn in an otherwise fast boardgame. And finally, it's not very durable. The clear bubble is already scratched up on the inside after just one night's use."
5,Eerie and unforgettable,"There's not much I can add to the excellent reviews already posted. What I can say is this music is even more haunting when listened to by itself, with no visuals from the movie to distract you. If 'Death Rattle' and 'Man With The Harmonica' don't make the hair on the back of your neck stand up, nothing will.Ennio Morricone is truly a master."
5,As Much the Movie as the Movie is,"Others have spoken well about this excellent soundtrack. Suffice it to say this is perhaps me favorite motion picture soundtrack. When I first saw the movie, the songs stuck with me like none ever did before. I bought the LP when I saw it, have the CD now.This soundtrack is as much the movie as the movie is. They are inseparable."
5,Once Upon A Time In The West,"This score fits this movie like a hand in a glove. It is hauntingly beautiful and makes this movie the fine production it is. It has to rank right up with some of the best scores ever written for the movies. One of the best that comes to my mind that it ranks with is Max Steiner's great score for ""Gone With The Wind""."
2,too small,"Although I am the only person who uses my car (i.e. only one person's worth of trash) and am relatively neat, this trash can is still too small -- much smaller than it looks in the picture. Once it has one coffee cup it in, it is mostly full. It's better than nothing, but if I were buying something now I would definitely get something bigger. Also the velcro doesn't really work, and, as others mentioned, it's annoying that it doesn't close properly once you put a liner bag in."
4,Great LITTLE garbage can. Just what I wanted.,"Unlike other reviewers, I'm not disappointed by the small size of this litter bin. However, there are a couple of flaws... First, as stated by others, no amount of trying will make the velcro adhere to my carpeting, so it's useless. Second. the pieces that are supposed to give the bag shape don't work very well. I'd buy it again, despite these issues because it's small, discrete and hides the trash."
4,Size Anyone?,"No Knock on the seller, but this is definitely smaller than they made it out to be in this photo. The litter bag I received is about 2/3rd's the size of a cars center console if not smaller. I drive a Saab and if you know this vehicle then you know that there pretty much luxury compact cars with very little leg room. This trash sits perfectly on my back seat floor about four inches wide. I would recommend this product for a smaller vehicle but think twice if you think your McDonalds cup and bag will fit in it. It is leak proof and well made with a heavy duty material. For its size you can stuff a lot of trash in it with no problems but two small coffee cups and it's time to empty. I would recommend a larger size for an SUV."
2,Too Expensive for Size,Although it is a great product it is way too small for how expensive it is. I was thinking it was going to be a bit bigger anf after some research a two gallon just like it for only $13 dollars. Make sure if you buy the item you have a compact car. Other than that the product is great.
1,Litter Bag for Vehicle,Not happy with construction of bag. It's already coming apart after a short time in use. I will be getting a replacement for it. Definitely won't be from this mfg.
1,defect! Boo,"This product arrived, looks great, but the snap on inside which allows for support is missing, so will not be rigid = no function. The return label is missing, now I have to spend time repacking, finding a label, shipping back etc.boo"
3,Beware - It is small,"Nice convenient trash bin that sticks well to floor with velcro so that it doesn't tip over, but beware it is very small. I was expecting and hoping for something much bigger."
2,Tiny Trash Bin,"For $17, I was expecting a lot more than what I got. The trash bin is so small, I can't believe I paid $17 for it. If you put a bag in it, the bag will be in the way of the velcro to keep the lid closed. A magnet would be a better idea. It works, and is nice to have."
4,Nice item for the price!,"I bought this despite some of the reviews of being small. I couldn't find dimensions anywhere so here they are (8 1/8"" h x 5 3/4"" w x 8"" L). Plenty of room for me and one or two companions, the way I normally travel. Just as a test, I put 4 soda cans in it vertical and another 2 horizontal with almost room for a fifth vertical. If you are hard on things or traveling with several children you may want to look at a different item as this is a soft side container. I also liked the sand bottom and Velcro to keep it in place. I'm not sure how useful the side pockets will be but they will allow for a bit more trash to be stored. Hope this was helpful!"
3,smaller than expected,Pretty sturdy though it is a bit smaller than what I expected. I had to think how to anchor it.
2,Doesn't stay in place,"This doesn't stay in place. Therefore, it does not get used! I wish it would have worked and solved my messy car problem!"
4,Purchased as a Gift.,Bought this as a replacement for another car waste basket that had deteriorated. This one seems to fit the bill although I thought it might be too large and take up too much room in the back seat.
4,Talus,"Arrived in short time, Works well and Holds alot. The color is perfect for my vehicle. Well worth the money"
4,Super!,Received on timeThe product was in perfect conditionAnd it was just what i was looking forThanks !In the car works good
5,Works well,This container is a good size for keeping the interior of your car clutter free. The weighted bottom does a surprisingly good job of keeping the container upright and stationary. The liner is supposed to be waterproof but I still line the container with a grocery bag for easy cleaning. I would recommend one for people that spend a lot of time in their car.
4,Mighty Little,"I really like the container ,But, it could be twice the size. fills up pretty fast and there's more than enough room to widen and deepen the size for my 2008 GMC pickup"
3,Smaller than Depicted,"When you look at the photograph of this item, it look so much bigger than the actual item, I know it says compact in the description but seriously??!! We opened it up and although it is functional and works OK in the car, it is ridiculously small!!!!! We laughed hard at how small it was when we got it out! I'm going to will this to my daughter who is going to start driving soon. Other than that, it does what it is supposed to do."
4,not as big as i thought,"this is a nice little trash bag. well made and sturdy. just small. i should have read the description. it just looked bigger in the photo. the bag stays open and up right very well. the cover is just a flap. not a lit that will shut which is fine. the bottom as some vercro to help stick to the floor but i don't see it gripping but it does have a little sad bag enclosed in the bottom that keeps it from moving around. overall, it works good. just small but i guess you wouldn't want so much trash sitting in your car anyways. as to liquids, i think it will do fine staying in and not spilling over. tho i have not try or would pour liquid in."
2,Objects (in the picture) appear larger than they are,"This might be really great if all you need is a place for used kleenex. Please read the product dimensions and try to imagine what that size container would hold, considering what you have in your car! In my car I have small water bottles, other drink containers, an occasional fast food bag, and mail that's not going home. This will hold about one day's worth of that! One-half day if my grandchildren are with me.Product is well built and attractive. The weight (a bean bag) takes up some of the trash space in a zippered compartment on the bottom. The bag I have is 7 x 6 x 8. (Not the listed dimensions) Minus the bean bag = not much space for trash. Right now there is a water bottle, a juice bottle, and a crumpled up paper bag. Full. Time to empty.I am returning the three I just bought for all the cars in the family."
3,Attic fan motor OLM6151,"This motor is very loud. When it's running in the attic, I can hear it all the way downstairs. Instructions say it needs to be oiled after two years. Seriously? Does anyone do that?"
5,was what i wanted came ahead of date,great service item was as discrib and it was deliuvered ahead of propmised date. was a exact replace ment and its running quite
2,It's not the soundtrack,"If you love Every Single Note of music in the video this CD almost hurts. If you don't know and love the video this is a good CD. Its almost like they pushed everyone but Mandy Patinkin and Bernadette Peters up to the mic and then rushed them through their parts. And Bernadette doesn't have that haunting ache she delivers so well on the video. See the video, but buy this for a couple of the songs that stay fairly close to the mark."
2,I Can't Believe it's from Sondheim,"All I can say about this is boring. Boring lyrics, boring music, boring subject matters, interesting performers. I love every other Sondheim musical with the exception of Anyone Can Whistle and Pacific Overatures, and I am very dissapointed. Thank God they saved themselves six years later with INTO THE WOODS"
1,A Poor Example of What Sondheim Can Do,"Scrolling down the screen, I see a lot of four and five star reviews of this CD. I feel bad about doing this, but I bought ""Sunday"" only because I though Sondheim would have repeated the brilliance he put into the likes of ""Sweeney Todd"" and ""Company."" I think this CD is garbage. Maybe the score sounds better when mixed with the other elements of the show (which I've heard many good things about). I saw the second act of the B'way production, though, a was not impressed."
2,Pppppttttthhhhllllltttt!,"Sondheim, your work is very intricate, very tediously written, the performances were outstanding, and would have been better if you had included a MELODY OR TWO IN THIS SHOW!"
4,Sunday,"Bernadette Peters is amazing as Dot and Marie. Mandy Patinkin is great, but I liked his performance in Evita better. How La Cage Aux Folles beat out Sunday in the Park With George is beyond me, but rest assured this is a magnificent work of art. Like the painting."
4,Still the best!,"I first saw the video of SITPWG, and I must say I was a little disappointed when I got the CD: the voices are sometimes behind the music, the sound changes, and most of all I found that several songs were ""rushed"" (Sunday in the park..., Everybody loves Louis). But even though, it still gives me shivers everytime I put in on the player. The music is gorgeous anyway. Just buy the video as well as the CD :-) !"
4,not quite perfection,"i think this show drags in the second act. fortunately, this isn't as apparent when listening to this recording. ms. peters is excellent (and should have won the tony). this was probably the last performance mr. patinkin gave before his voice became just too precious to be tolerated. (i love the act two opener ""it's hot up here"")"
2,Do not get this version if you want the lyrics booklet!!!,Dont make the same mistake I did and get the newer 2007 version. The sound is not much different to the original recording. If its remastered it should have included the original booklet info along with the new liner notes. Otherwise it is a great musical.I'd get the 1990 release or earlier of this which does include the lyrics of the songs and not just pointless liner notes.
1,Worst Musical Ever,"This is, quite simply, the worst musical ever written. Boring, self-indulgent and completely lacking in charm. It is difficult to sing, worse to listen to, and impossible to sit through. Sondheim fans rant and rave about it's technical superiority in terms of musical sophistication. Sophisticated it is, entertaining it most definitely is not. I honestly never expected to find a musical I didn't like, but in this case I did. Do not buy this album, do not go to see this show. It is art for art's sake, and that should never be encouraged."
4,Great starter kit,Great starter kit. Everything you need to get going is here and easy to set up. I recommend this product.
4,Not bad for the price,"For the price you would think that these are junk knives but I love a good knife and these are great for the price. Compared to the Henkels they are similar in quality. They hone well, have a nice angle to them for chopping and work well. I was suprised how well these keep up with the $120 chef knife. For the price try it; give to the kids if you don't like them."
3,Hovers on flat smooth surfaces,"Maybe I was expecting too much, but this toy does not work well outside. It will move but just because the wheels rotate and kind of push it along, not because it's actually floating.Inside on hardwood floors it works pretty well and actually floats along (you can push it and it will skim from one side of the kitchen to the other).We took it on water and it moves around by floating on the Styrofoam embedded in the wheels and being pushed by the wheels rotating. It does bubble from the front wheel where air is being pushed out, but it does not float on a cushion of air in the water.My take is that if you plan on using this inside on hardwood floors, garage floors or basement floors you are going to be fine, but otherwise you may be disappointed."
4,Wonderful Toy,This is a wonderful toy for an older child. Both my boys(12 & 8) love to play with it.It is a bit hard for the younger(8)to control.But he is determined to learn. All in all it is fun and provides great outside intertainment.
4,"Fast, versatile and FUN.","I bought it for my son (5 year old) for Christmas, and he just loves it. Our house has hardwood floor, which is perfect for this hovercraft to float around, but it runs fine over carpets as well. We haven't tried it on the water yet but I have no doubt it will work fine there as well, as those three black wheels have big foam inside.So far, the only (minor) complaints are: the relatively short battery life, and lack of any indicator on the charger (you can't tell whether the battery is fully charged or not)."
2,OK but not great,"really is only partially a hovercraft, the unit does seem to float somewhat on it air cushion, but the rear wheels are actually pushing it along, since it only works well on flat hard surfaces or water, I suspect the rubber cushions will wear out fairly soon. Does not work well at all on grass or uneven surfaces"
3,fair,"doesn't hold charge for long. Is not as 'all terrain"" as it sounded. Still, son has enjoyed it."
3,Fun but hard to control,"It's fun for open spaces. Our 5 year old really likes it. Steering is hard to control with any precision (even for us adults). So it tends to bump into a lot of things in the house. The battery seems to run down pretty quickly. Note the size of this toy. It is bigger than I anticipated. We paid significantly less for this on Amazon. It was $[...]at our local Toys R Us. It wouldn't have been worth that price, but it's probably worth the price on Amazon."
4,Great!,"I think that this CD is one of the best Dolly Parton has ever made, I have got some of her songs on tape but ""I will always love you"", Jolene and Love is like a butterfly sound so much better on this CD. I recommend it to anyone."
2,The Author's Opinions Shine Through,"This book is on a fascinating subject, but the author seems to have written it to make an anti-Western political statement. At the end, he argues that the British possession of the Falkland Islands is just like the British rule over India or Egypt. This falls flat. The Falkands are inhabited by British people who want to be part of Britain. The islands were never part of Argentina. Why does he argue against British imperialism only to argue for Argentine imperialism?"
3,Rating Fish Food?,"Honestly, Amazon wants me to rate the fish food we ordered for my office fish tank? I can't tell you how it tastes, if it was of pleasing quality of if the freaking fish enjoyed it. The fish are alive so I guess it passed.Jeeez."
3,Realm shower gel,"Smells good. The Pheremone deal is overated. Actually it doesnt work at all. Have tried night in and night out , but it has had no affect on my wife. It does smell good to me though."
3,"Mediocre ""intro"" to Japanese cuisine","This book seemed like an excellent book when I read it before going to Japan. However, once I was there, all of the food sections were pretty much useless. None of the listings were detailed enough and almost all of the restaurants had menus completely unique and different from the one's listed in the book.However, the book's main redeeming value is page 32/33 and 42/43 that gives very useful phrases to use in restaurants. Otherwise you can pretty much do without the book. If you don't read kanji, you're pretty much on your own and will probably end up pointing to pictures and saying ""I want that."" If you read kanji, you'll be able to guess over 50% of what's on the menu."
2,For the adventurous,"This book is more suited to those on a culinary tour of Japan, or those looking to taste the entire culture. I went on a short business trip, and ordinary guidebooks seemed to have enough information for survivial (for me at least).If you're the sort of person who likes to try everything, this book may be for you. For a one week trip, I did not have time to take advantage of all of the information."
1,disapointed,"A boring compilation of cut and paste magazine articles. It would challenge the worlds biggest skyline enthusiast to get through this one. Try (Skyline GT-R : The ultimate japanese supercar)by andy butler, a far superior read."
5,John Denver's Magnum Opus,"Far and away the best of John Denver's albums. The raw guitar licks combined with John Denver's sonorous tenor voice make this album not only the best of Denver's offerings, but also a quintessential folk album. The last five songs, labeled the ""Season Suite"" particularly make this album stand out, not to mention ""Rocky Mountain High,"" one of John Denver's most recognized songs. The guitar work on all of the songs is impeccable, especially the gritty sound on ""Prisoners."" Sadly, the rest of John Denver's subsequent albums never reached the same caliber as this one. If there is one album someone should buy of John's music beside his Greatest Hits (vol. 1), this is the one."
5,One of the best,"The cover of this album is a striking photograph of John Denver in the midst of his beloved nature - the river is fast flowing and vibrant all around him. The music is the same on the album, beginning with one of his signature songs in the title track, and containing well known classics like ""Goodbye Again"". Two lesser known tracks make this album buying even if you already have a greatest hits collection - ""For Baby"" and ""Mother Nature's Son"" - continuing his early album covers of McCartney songs. The performances are bright, the music tight and engaging. This is again not the best digital transfer I've ever heard, but it does not detract from a superb all round album - including the Seasons Suite, adventurous and compelling stuff from a master at his peak."
4,"Good CD, I love his music",Rocky Mountain HighI use his music to write round dances . I love his music & singing style. I have most of his CD's.
4,Catchy,"I always liked his music, but it seems a little off. I get the feeling that if you listen to too many Denver albums you end up joining a cult or living in a commune, talking about herbs and cycles of the moon.I think they found a bunch of these records at Jonestown."
4,WOW!!! Plow through to the end-you'll be glad you did!,"By the middle of this book, I felt lost in the blizzard! So half-way through I was all set to put it down and forget about it. How much could I take of these musings of a 16-year-old? However, she is smarter (and more articulate) than your average 16-year-old. It was like an avalanche of too much introspection! Yet something made me stick with the book. And the ending was so gripping and surprising that it was well worth it! So, plow through it--you'll be glad you did!"
3,"Stop the story, I'm out of research notes!","As far as it goes, Born Royal is an interesting view into the lives of George V's children. The problem is that it doesn't go far enough.The author spends far too much time on David (the Duke of Windsor) and his younger brother Bertie (George VI), who have already been the subjects of numerous biographies, and gives George V's other children short shrift. It's unfortunate, given that there isn't much written about them. Hough apparently referred mainly to research he undertook while writing his books on the Mountbattens; since Mary, George, Henry and John didn't figure much in those books, they don't figure much here."
5,Another Montgomery Success,"Selena Montgomery's Art of Desire takes the reader on a sophisticated tour of romance. Her characters are smart, witty, and worldly. They live a lofty existence, but experience down-to-earth conflicts and desires. Ms. Montgomery once again takes the romance novel to a new level, one truly worthy of this book's title."
2,Doesn't play WMA??? WHAT!!!!,What??? It doesn't play WMA's? Grrrrr... and I just won this thing on Ebay. I looked at other websites and they said it plays WMA's. I need something to replace my Rio Volt SP150.
4,a great novel!,"Ahmed Ali poignant storyline acts as a prelude to the social events to follow that would change the city and it's people forever. It allows us to go back in time and be a part of old Delhi, now nonexistant. The introduction (written much later) is a confusing blend of history of the city and author's post-independence experience. I disagree about his comments regarding Rammohan Roy, which is inconsistent in the prose. But all in all, Thoroughly enjoyable!"
5,Still burnin',"When it comes to blockbuster hit albums of the 80's, you'd be hard pressed to find one as consistantly listenable as this. This is the Pointer Sisters at there commercial peak and they truly shine on every cut which more often than not are Hit Singles. I NEED YOU (R&B #13, POP #48), AUTOMATIC (R&B #2, POP #5), JUMP (FOR MY LOVE) (R&B #3, POP #3), I'M SO EXCITED, (POP #9), NEUTRON DANCE (POP # 6, R&B # 13) and BABY COME AND GET IT (R&B #24, POP #44). All here and all sounding as good today as they did then. All of the Pointers' 80s albums were pretty great but this one will be there most memorable for most and if you don't have it on CD yet then get it now. It's that simple."
5,The Pointer Sister's biggest Hit,"""Break Out"" was a perfect name for this album.The Pointer Sister's had 4 big hits off this one record,even though ""I'm so Excited"" wasen't on the original record.I happened to buy that first album,and later bought the CD with ""I'm so excited"" on it.I've never in my life heard of putting on a song from an older record,and re-release the single,but it worked,and I'm glad it did.""I'm so Excited"" is a great song.My favorite is ""Jump."" This came out at the same time as Van Halen's ""Jump."" ""Neutron Dance,""and ""Automatic"" were huge hits also.I just wish the early Pointer Sisters records were on CD's.I love there version of ""Steam Heat,"" and ""Salt Peanuts."" I hope this is not the end of the Pointer Sisters recording career.I really miss there fantastic voices."
3,This one is not their best,"I must admit I don't know every song on this record, just Jump, Neutron Dance, Automatic, I'm so excited. But I assume the others won't be better. Which would mean they are OK Disco songs, worth 3 stars. Do you want to know the best Pointer Sister Album, which really kicks in? Yes? It is their 1980 ""Special Things"" which apparently does not exist on CD yet. Wait until that happens and buy it! It is one of my favorite soul albums (cf. also my review of Millie Jackson's ""For Men Only"")"
3,"good songs, o.k. album!","I have to say right away that the Pointer Sisters are one of the most eclectic groups/artist I have come across! From country ""Fairytales"", from jazz to soul ""Yes we can,can"". The Break Out album is the pop album of pops for the Pointer Sisters, which isn't a bad thing. I must say that I do enjoy some tracks of this album: ""Automatic"", ""Jump(For my love)"" and ""Telegraph your love"". The album is what every album tried to be in the 80's ""danceable"" and Break Out succeeds, but the majority of the material is cheesy and bubble-gum. The fact that these are full grown women who use to sing adult contemporary soul and jazz, Break Out seems more of a ""Sell Out""!"
5,Great,very good product i use it everyday to bring back bad potentiomiters and noisy controls works as advertised a+ 5 stars good seller
5,Best contact cleaner out there,I have used CAIG DeOxit contact cleaner for about 10 years and haven't met anything better. It really works and its effect lasts very long! It removes oxidation on silver-plated and other electrical contacts and leaves a thin film of lubrication on them.Be warned when you order this can; even though it is advertised as 10.4 ounces it's only a standard smallish 5 oz. (142g.) can. :(
5,Caig Deoxit,"This is the best contact cleaner I have ever used. I use it on all types of electronics, even works on some computer cable connections. I highly recommend this product."
1,Be careful of the aerosol,"The aerosol can will loose its proellant in a very short time. The company says this normal, but there is nothing on the can to suggest it. Buy the liquid if you need this stuff."
3,This product needs improvement,"This is a nice idea, but the light scribe takes 20-25 minutes to work which is way to long. The dvds are very expensive with light scribe, It looks quite dim on DVDs, it is not quite professional looking yet. This product needs improvement."
1,Garbage,"Rants from a socialist in denial. Only thinly veiled lies, half-truths and distortions, packaged as documentary. I'd only pick this up if I ran out of toilet paper. After I rented Bowling for Columbine I returned it to the store. They gave me my money back for the rental but if they had given me twice the rent price back I'd still feel ripped off."
1,Misrepresented,"Great in theory, but someone screwed up: listing says ""Columbine"" is the 2-disc special edition, packaging says it's the 2-disc special edition (even lists the features!), but it's the single-disc edition. Hope that was an innocent oversight..."
4,Satire at it's best,Haven't seen them all yet but Michael Moore shows a far-side view of the country's problems and usually pays the price for it.
5,Moore for President!,"I am a huge Michael Moore fan, and this box set is absolutely fantastic! I loved it. These documentaries are great to watch and extremely eye-opening. Definitely must see movies."
2,"looks good, but doesn't work well","My mom loves oyster, so one of her gift was an oyster knife to replace her old one. We gave it to her with a pair of gloves and two-dozen small/medium oysters. Sadly we only opened 2-3 with it.I have opened Oysters for our large family for every holidays as far as I can remember.Pro: The design looks good, and I like the safety plates in case you slipCon: the stainless blade is too thick and end of it is too dull. We could not insert it in the small/medium Oyster.May be it works better for the large oyster, but if you like small and medium oysters, find a knife that has a thin blade made of hardened steel."
5,Another overlooked Gem!,Sure people still love Sanctuary but what about the rest of this cd. This was a great guitar album when nobody in the alternative market was doing it anymore. There is a reason that The Cult are such big influences even today. They made great rock and roll.This cd is darker than their others and has a great sound. The guitar just grooves. You don't hear this sound very often. This cd still has a fresh sound after 15 years.
4,Pretty cool,"This is a great album that every musician should have and study. The guitar riffs are incredible and the effects and tones are great. The whole album has a really neat feel. The songs are less great songs than incredible grooves. The multiple guitar parts are easily the best part of the CD, with different riffs layering over each other. It sounds like the guitars are f___ing each other! The singer is annoying, but you can get used to him. Definitely worth buying, though."
1,Too bad the remaster brickwalled everything...,A lost chance to bring new luster to this masterpiece.The sound engineers clearly messed everything up. The sound is unlistenable!
5,Rock!,"Pure gool-ol' rock'n'roll. No bull. One of the best. Amongst with Sonic Temple, definetely one of their best. But also, a excellent rock album."
5,Sanctuary For Sale,"This album was a transitional piece for Rock n' Roll, bridging the gap between the loud and punkish music of the 70's, and that which came before it in the latter part of the 60's... It is also where the Cult came into their own, as a force to be reckoned with... Love set the stage for what was to come in a beautifully dark and poetic way. Even today, after 18 years the music still holds it's own against the wave of artificial comercial rock that has claimed the airwaves. So listen in and be prepared...."
3,Where have all the headshots gone?,"I had the Dog Gallery Calendar for 2005 and I loved it! It was hard to resist flipping through all of the pages in one sitting. There was a good variety of breeds and shots - some artsy, some more candid and fun. However, I find the 2006 calendar lacking in the quality of photos. I feel like every other page includes a photo of some obscure body part. I'm honestly not that interested in looking at a close-up of a poodle's pom pom ankle or a doberman's ear. I plan to give it another shot in 2007, but I hope they leave the extreme close-ups out next time around."
5,Great Calendar,I bought a bunch for Christmas presents and all the receivers loved them! I got one for myself too!
5,THIS ALBUM WILL MAKE YOU WANT TO SING ALONG!,"It's me again!This album is terrific! I hadn't heard a few songs on this album,and I buy any Dolly album even if it's only got one or two songs that I haven't got! My favourite is ""Baby I'm Burnin'"" because the lyrics are very strong. This is very original Dolly work.Amongst the tracks are everyone's favourites; ""Mama Say A Prayer""""Jolene"" ""9 To 5"" and ""Do I Ever Cross Your Mind?""Changing the subject,if you are thinking of buying ""Little Sparrow,"" I think you are making a fab choice. Go buy it!(You won't regret it, I PROMISE.)"
3,A SURGEON IN COMBAT,It was O.K.I expected more detail with what really went on. I have also given it to my LIBRARY.I come from CAMBRIDGE so I was pleased to see MAAS GENERAL HOSPITAL noted
5,Well liked by Gods and Generals,"Gods and Generals is a wonderful combination of fact and fiction. That was extremely helpful to me because it provided me with a lot of information about the first half of the Civil War without boring me to death. The setting is in the United States (mostly Virginia but there are a few seens elswhere) from just before the Civil War to the end of the battle of Chancellorsville. This includes such battles as Williamsburg, Fredericksburg, Antietam, and a brief acount of Bull Run. It also gives you the third person prospective of union Major General Winfield Scott Hancock, union Lt. Colonel Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain, confederate General Robert E. Lee, and confederate General Thomas Jonathan ""Stonewall"" Jackson. The only person who tops Jeff Sharra in writing about the Civil War is his father Michael Sharra in The Killer Angels."
3,Punctuation mars otherwise good read,"It may seem strange to say that you wouldn't buy another of an author's works because of three little dots, but that's the case here. Shaara's habit of trailing off practically every piece of dialog with an ellipsis makes all his characters seem rather vague and simple-minded, which for me ruined the effect of the story. Surely the likes of Lee and Longstreet were decisive people who would end all their sentences with periods, if not exclamation marks! I was hoping he had mended his ways, or had them mended by an editor, for the sequel, but on picking it up I saw that it was not so."
5,"Like Father, Like Son","Following in the footsteps of his fathers novel, ""The Killer Angels"", Jeff Shaara's ""Gods And Generals"" is a loose prequel, and every bit as good as his fathers tale.We follow the same people from the first novel as they work their way toward their destiny at Gettysburg. One new focus is ""Stonewall"" Jackson and his part in the Civil War. Once again this is historical fiction and it pulls you in and makes the dry facts breath and puts you into the history.A great read!"
3,An Average Book,"Gods and Generals is an adventurous story. Historical and reviving, it takes you back to the past during the Civil War. The battle tactics that are used are interesting. I would recommend this book to people who are intrigued in history or have any knowledge of the Civil War. Gods and Generals is about the Union and Confederacy fighting to win the war. The character development is hard to follow because each chapter switched from person to person. At times, the story can get confusing when different characters start to tell their point of view. During the fighting, the book makes me want to keep reading. This book may be hard to keep up with the characters, but other than that it is pretty good."
2,Joe and Generals,"I think Gods and Generals is a semi-horrible book. This book has too many different types of settings. It goes from a bright and sunny day, to two feet of snow. This book also switches between the main characters too often. This may be a good idea for showing different points of view, but it also a good way to get someone confused. This book also has no plot twists what so ever,which makes this book very obvious and can get boring. There is one plot twist, and that plot twist is really predictable. If you want to read this book I suggest you make that you are out of firwewood first. This is what i think about the horrible book Gods and Generals."
4,Great Prelude to his fathers novel,"Jeff Shaara has succeeded in writing an excellent to his fathers novel ""The Killer Angels"". This novel focuses on the lives of several of the soon to be principle men of the Civil War in the years preceding the war up through the battle of Chancelorsville. Shaara describes in excellent detail the religious zeal that Stonewall Jackson exhibited as well as the deeply religious Robert E. Lee. Shaara also does an excellent job describing the low morale of the Federal troops as they get many different commanders who lead them to defeat. I recommend this book to everyone with an interest in the Civil War."
2,The story ends in a fizzle.,"""Gods and Generals"", starts well enough. However, the farther the story goes the more piecemeal it becomes. I liked the book's beginning. The history of the breakup of the army, at the beginning of the war, provides a rich source of storylines. The book follows the lives of four men, when any one of their war experiences is more than enough to make a book. The last part of the book left the four characters underdeveloped. I think a better story could be had by focusing on the relationship between Lee and Jackson. Then the book could have properly ended after the battle at Chancellorsville."
4,J.S's tale that takes you inside some famous Civil War minds,I believe that Jeff Shaara's book Gods and Generals is a masterful look inside the heads of some of the Civil War's most famous generals. It gives the reader a deep sense of friendship with these men as you read each page. With every turn you feel closer and closer to these men as you follow them through what became history. Jeff Shaara has taken a new approach at trying to explain what went on in the Civil War through both Northern and Southern eyes. I believe this fresh approach gives life to the the part of the Civil War genre that has become simple fact-listing. That is why I believe this book is an excellent choice for interested readers Civil War type books.
2,Not the chip off the old block,"Jeff Shaara make a game effort, but his is simply not the storyteller his father was. On it's own, it stands weakly to ""Killer Angels"". Realizing full well this book is not history, it is a novel - a story based on historic events great dramatic license must be granted. Unfortunately that allowance greatly stretched credibility in the actions and personality of the characters and particular events. Shaara might been have written on his own of characters of his creation and not under the shade of his father's literary skill. If you are a fan of historical fiction, this might be your book. If you are new to the genre, pass this book and go straight to ""Killer Angels"". If you are knowledgeable of the period, this book will greatly disappoint if not irritate you."
2,Tough Shoes To Fill,I found this book to be disappointing. The reason may simply be because The Killer Angels is such a hard act to follow.
1,The Definition of Trash,Trash sells and this is the definition of trash. Unfortunately many readers see this as history instead of fiction. Shaara who may have had a ghost writer obviously never visited a manuscipt library to do research. Readers should stick to reading the history of these events done by people who know how to research and how to write.
4,Holding My Breath,The coming movie is directed by the same guy who directed Gettysburg. Gettysburg was the worst Civil War movie I have ever seen. Martin Sheen was totally miscast as Lee. The silly accents and constant saluting would have made me laugh had I not been so let down by the poor quality of the whole production.Robert Duvall may be able to overcome this director's inadequacies with his excellent abilities. We shall see.
4,Check your history bozo's,"For you ""know-it-all's"" who are claiming that Shaara is incorrect in portraying Joshua Chamberlain's 20th Maine as attacking Marye's Heights during the first Battle of Fredericksburg....you ought to check your history. Try reading Willard Wallace's bio of Chamberlain, ""Soul of the Lion""; Wallace quotes Chamberlain's own words of how his regiment ascended the Heights and attacked the Rebel defenders. I know its so easy for people to criticize and ridicule historical-fiction, but before writing your complaints, check your facts."
2,History Un-told,"A wonderful job of misrepresenting the facts and characters involved in some of the Civil War's most pivotal events. Remember when you read this that is is historical FICTION. There is much that is overlooked, misrepresented, embelished or just downright made up. It's a novel, not a history of the Civil War, and that is something that everyone who reads this book needs to remind themselves every time they turn a page. As a novel it is fine, but don't take it for gospel. For the real story head to the non-fiction section"
3,Good but not great,"This is a good unraveling of some unique Civil War characters. The road to Gettysburg is a little less foggy now thanks to Jeff Sharra. His literary style, however, is not quite up to his father's fine standard. His sentence style is very repetitive, and eventually annoying."
4,Do not skip this book because of the movie...,"I was stunned at how much I enjoyed this book. I had avoided it for years since I was not a big fan of the movie. This book really explains well both the history of the Civil War (troop movements, etc) as well as the personalities of its participants. It is an intimate portrayal of these characters, especially Lee and Jackson. I found it to be quite compelling and I'm looking forward to book three of the trilogy."
4,Gods and Generals...from Historical facts to fascinating story,"God's will be done. This motive, God's will/morality for the four main generals, Robert Lee, Stonewall Jackson, Winfield Hancock, and Joshua Chamberlain, provides without a reasonable doubt how selfless these men truly were and how stalwart they were during that time and age.Shaara goes to the heart and soul of what he believes these men stand for. This Historical event, the Civil War, is colored through background stories and fictional character that Shaara makes up to help the flow of the book. It is this flow that causes GODS AND GENERALS to be so appealing. GODS AND GENERALS is not your wow-this-is-bland history book. Shaara does not just state facts;however, their usage helps him depict what these men might be going through.All in all, this book is well worth reading. Though it may be considered quite long, the book itself seems quite short once you begin reading. Thank you Shaara, for making history fascinating."
5,I thought it was great,"If you ask me there can never be enough films or books about the Civil War. Gods and Generals stands out because of its superlative realism, suspense, and historical accuracy. It ranks right up there in my mind with the best of the genre, I put it on an equal level with great war novels like All Quiet on the Western Front and The Triumph and the Glory. Schaara has written a gem."
4,worthy detail with a fictitous spin.,"Shaara's book is a good story about some interesting generals. His accounts of Jackson are particularly good. The book, however, bogs down at times."
5,Great Book,I found this book to be excellent. I read the Killer Angels before I read Gods and Generals and Jeff Shaara does a great job following in his fathers footsteps. I especially liked how it covers many different peoples thoughts like Lee and Hancock and etc. This book was excellent.
4,"Jeff Shaara's best book yet, an extraordinary feat","When I heard that Jeff Shaara was planning to continue his father's memorable work, I was a little tense. ""Gods and Generals"" dispersed any fears I might have had. Taking Civil War literature to the next level, the young Shaara follows the exploits of four leading (or soon-to-be leading) men of the conflict. Continually shifting points of view between Union and Confederate, East and West, battlefield and city offices, during a time period spanning from early stages of the secession crisis to the great turning of the tide at Gettysburg, his accomplishment in creating an accurate, concise, and balanced view of history has not been, and it is likely never to be matched in a fictional work. With a lively format, good mapwork, and a subtle but powerful style of writing, ""Gods and Generals"" cannot be compared to ""The Killer Angels"", but, then again, what can be? Michael Shaara would have been proud of his son's work."
5,Are you a God or a General?,"Gods and Generals is a fantastic book. To really understand this book you must know a little about the civil war. The way that Jeff Shaara portrays these characters is interesting. The movie is somewhat like the book. The book is much more in depth, and really gives you the feeling of what things were like. What is really interesting about Jeff Shaara's writing style is that he will have on chapter about what General Lee is doing, and then the next chapter will be about what General Hancock is doing, so he tells both side of the spectrum. Something that is really helpful is in the intro, Shaara tells about each General portrayed in the book. It gives you somewhat of an Idea of what the Generals where like. As much as I like this book it isn't for everyone. If you appreciate history this is for you."
3,Review,"I had a complaint but it has been resovled. The book did not match the description. I paid almost full price for a ""book line new"" but received an obviously used book. I was reimbursed part of the purchase price to resolve the issue."
2,"Like Father, Not Like Sun","Filled with awkward prose, and bizarre grammar, Gods and Generals only proves that literary talent may not be genetic. Do yourself a favor and just reread Killer Angels."
1,Don't be fooled: Jeff Shaara is not his father,"Don't be fooled (as I was, and as marketeers hope you will be) into thinking that Jeff Shaara carries on the tradition of his father's writing: he doesn't. His writing drags and plods along. He should have left well enough alone. ""The Killer Angels"" is a masterpiece, and Jeff Shaara is dragging it out to no good end. He should try to write something of his own, rather than capitalizing on his father's good name. ""The Killer Angels"" stands alone and does not need to be dragged out in this manner. Jeff Shaara adds nothing to the story."
2,too military-oriented,"Althought this book was very well-written and the research appears to be incredible, I felt it did not provide a well-rounded prespective of the Mexican-American War. All of the views presented are from military leaders. I was hoping Shaara would include at least a couple chapters told from the stance of someone involved in the political and/or economic aspects of the war; or perhaps from some of the more ""common"" people who are affected by war. Since this is technically a work of fiction, it seems he could have easily done this without disrupting the sequence of military events in the war. In ""rise to rebellion"" Shaara told the story from several differing points of view. Here the characters are not very divergent from one another and so I felt like I was getting a one-sided view of the entire conflict. Read only if you are interested in MILITARY fiction, not necessarily historical fiction."
2,lacking in details and intimancies,"i'll be the first to admit that i'm biased based on my expectations from shaara's father's great book, the killer angels. it is not fair to compare the two, but because reading the father's book lead me to buy this one, i thought i should mention it. this book does not contain nearly the details and intimancies of the father's book. it is not surprising since this one covers a much longer time frame than the battle of gettysburg, so shaara has less pages to devote to each person and battle. but the result is a less satisfying book. it skims rather than digs deep."
4,Great Book,"I bought the book 'Gods and Generals' for my husband who is a history teacher and has been reading all of Jeff Shaar books. The book was unused, but you could tell that it had been on the shelf for quite a while. Great deal though, And great book if you are interested in the Civil War!"
4,Insight to the Civil War,"Gods and Generals is an action packed book that brings you back in time and into the minds of the great generals of the Civil War. I would recommend this book to anyone who is looking for more insight about the battles and decisions of the generals. i am not a strong reader so it was hard to get into. Although this book is hard to understand at first it becomes interesting and is almost impossible to put down after you get use to the tone of the author. I especially liked the diagrams of the battles because it helped me picture what the generals were thinking and how they came up with the battle strategies based on the terrain. I liked reading about the characters, also. But the ones I really liked reading about are the ones who left the Union because Virginia became part of the Confederacy like Jackson and Lee. Gods and Generals is an awesome book."
4,dankxmasterxj,"Gods and Generals really taught me a lot about the Civil War that I didn't already know. There is much detail in the strategies of attacks and defensive maneuvers from both points of view between the North and the South. Also how the Union Army was split when people serving in it found out that their homes in the South were leaving the Union. Of course, those serving had to go back to their homes and defend them. So basically, the people fighting in the war were fighting the people they once fought with.I also enjoyed how Mr. Shaara used the main generals of the war to tell the story of our Civil War. It was very interesting seeing how the politics of war came into play in the ranking of soldiers. How certain soldiers were ranked faster because of the need of officers. Over all, I enjoyed reading this book and if you wish to learn about the Civil War and be entertained at the same time, Gods and Generals is the book for you."
5,Excellent!,This is a very well-written chronology of events leading up to the American Civil War. Jeff Shaara brings to life the U.S.Military officers' gut-wrenching decisions on whether to fight for the North or South.
5,God's and Generals,An engaging and insightful approach to the individuals that shaped our US history. Jeff's fresh perspective shows evidence that he walked around in the spirit of the characters. They came alive and opened their souls for my reflection.
4,Gods and Generals continues the tradition of Shaara Magic,"Gods and Generals is a fantastic addition to the world of Civil War fiction. Shaara's style, while different from his father's, is powerful in character development as well description of battle scenes. He allows the reader to develop a relationship with the major players of America's worst war. A very powerful book that should be read by anyone that read Killer Angels."
3,Entertaining,Jeff Sharra has done a very good job in tackling a dfficult subject or subjects. Considering the fact that this is Mr. Sharra's first book the reader should allow for some gaps and occiasional plodding. But overall the book reads well and the 'people' of the times come alive especially Robert E.Lee and Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain...
4,"Gripping, this makes history interesting","It is hard to delve into mythic figures' psyches, not to mention tell a somewhat controversial historical story accurately, yet Jeff Shaara does that. I read _The Killer Angels_ while in a college Civil War history seminar. I wish I had this one to read then as well. I devoured this in 3 days...a great read!"
3,"Interesting, not very entertaining","Sometimes it's tough to like historical novels. The author accepts the challenge of entertaining those who know nothing of his topic and those who specialize in minutiae. Jeff Shaara does an excellent job of describing the build-up before each battle, but the dialogue is often stilted. As a historian, I'd give the book a 4-star rating but as a reader, 2-stars."
3,Check for typos!,"I waited for the release of this book. Killer Angels is what inspired me to become a History Teacher. It is clear that Shaara struggles with trying to imitate his fathers method of writing. In the beginning of the book I feel sympathetic toward him and applaud his attempts at matching the unorthodox style of his dad. But after seeing numerous, (I stopped counting after 20) typos and several areas where there is misinformation, my sympathy began to change to anger. There is no excuse for having that many typos in a book. I found it distracting and an annoyance. HINT - do not capitalize words after commas!! The publisher should be ashamed."
5,"Read it now, before the movie comes out!!","Someone once wrote of a book titled *Ishmael,* I now put all books into two categories: those I read before *Ishmael,* and those I read after. Along those lines, for many of us, father Michael's *Killer Angels* forever changed what we expect from a historical account. In that light, *Gods and Generals* does not disappoint. Comparison to his father's work in unadvoidable -- so I will address it up front. While *KA* did a much better job of bringing the Big Picture, the strategic level of the battle to the reader, *GAG* holds its own in all other aspects. Overall, a thrilling book that really dives into the psyches and motivation of the key players we thought we knew so well. It would be a mistake to dismiss this as merely a follow-up to his father's work. *GAG* stands quite well on its own."
4,Caesar,"Jeff shaara's book Gods And Generals was by far the best non-fiction historical novel that I have read. It goes in depth into the minds of all the famous generals that were in the civil war. The pictures that Shaara creates for you of the battles is amazing. When the generals felt sad, I felt sad, when the generals were overjoyed, I too felt there happiness. This book has to be one of shaara's best."
4,Awesome persepctive from which to learn pre-Civil War history,"My only complaint is about Jeff. I LOVE his other work but I keep getting distracted by the heavy use of ""...."" throughout the entire book. I assume that he is attempting to create a thoughtful pause but it isn't necessary and I have not seen it his other work. Otherwise it's fantastic."
1,"Anticipating more, I found less","I have to admit, I was very excited when I heard that this book was coming out. I thoroughly enjoyed Killer Angels for its approach, it's very well written prose, and its conciseness. I was sure that Jeff Shaara would have some difficulty following in this style. What I found was worse. It is a very difficult book to begin reading, and after several chapters I put it down for good. I found the writing style virtually unreadable and found myself re-reading lines to see if I was missing something. I always finish books...but this is one exception."
3,Not quite as good as The Killer Angels,"Assuming most readers will come to this book, like I did, after reading The Killer Angels, the Pulitzer Prize-winning masterpiece by Shaara's late father Michael, they will find an entertaining and well written story, but not a novel which compares to The Killer Angels. Shaara may have taken too much on here, for he is unable to really examine the issues of the Civil War as well as his father did.He does offer good recreations of the battles, but his portrayals of Civil War generals border on caricature, particularly the portrait of Stonewall Jackson as a dour puritan.Still, this book is worth the read; just don't get your hopes up."
3,Entertaining but not scholarly.,"This is good entertainment for any Civil War buff, filled with insight and anecdotes into a few of the leading characters of each side of the conflict. In fact, the author takes us through the steps that lead four great men to their armies and onto the battlefield: Generals Lee & Jackson for the Confederacy and Generals Hancock and Chamberlain for the Union. As such, it is a limited work that, not surprisingly more a novel than a work of history. Perhaps that's why it's about to make it to the Silver Screen, and no doubt shortly after that, to your local video store."
3,Not as pictured,The picture displayed with the small centerd logo is the BACK of the shirt. The front of the shirt contains a large screen printed Adidas Logo. Other than that the shirt seems to be of high quality. The sizes are somewhat smaller than normal (2XL).
2,DURABLE but...,"Rand McNally maps have never been my favorite: they tend not to include as wide an area; provide as much detail; or look as good as the competition. But I LOVE the durability of their EasyFinder series, and you will, too.Look first for BORCH maps - they're the BEST, and they're ""soft laminated"" (easier to hold than the EasyFinders.)Here at Amazon, in the search box enter ""Laminated [city / state / county / etc] Map by Borch. For example ""Laminated New Orleans Map by Borch."" You can simply enter ""Borch Maps"", but you're going to get PAGES of them, beginning with foreign countries first."
3,Not the best cad program,This cad program is fine if you are a pro at using cad programs but I would avoid it if you are a novice. The makers tried to incorperate too many functions in single modes thus making it harder to use. Since I can't return it I purchased the 9.2 version which I believe is a easier program to use than this one. I uninstalled this program and reinstalled my 9.2 version and glad I did.

5,Eye opener!,"This book definately without a doubt opened my eyes to the life in the United States. Granted the book is outdated, being experinced over twenty years, however the facts CAN NOT be over looked. The stories and experiences of Jacob Holdt are absolutely amazing. This book NEEDS to be read not only by the American people but also the people of the world. No matter your personal belief system, this book has the potential to shed an infinate amount of light of the ""sore subjects"" of America. Take and read this book with your eyes, mind, heart and soul open. It's dosen't get better! It is worth every penny!"
4,I enjoy this CD,My only complaint with this CD is that they use a shortened version of Freebird. If they can do the whole of American Pie then why not the long version of Freebird.
1,It Deserves a Clap,"Teea ChakrabortyhI! i AM sHREYONTI. I think 'Straight From The Heart' is my favourite song. It is more mature and sweeter than other songs. As far as the vocals go, Gangsta love is great because it has such a strange lyrics but you cannot exactly feel that. Most people do not like 'dance' but I do. 'Show me your Colours' is very different. 'Have You Ever' is cute. However the catchy songis 'Do it till we drop'. Rachel needs a clap for keeping up with the tempo. The song I did not care about was 'Dance Dance'. Its lyrics is not good enough. But on a whole, S Club is my favourite and I wish one day I will be able to meet them."
4,A bit of advice from a UK fan,"The best bit of advice I can give anyone thinking of buying this is to import the UK release Seeing Double instead. While Sunshine is a great album, Seeing Double is even better and in merging the two albums together to make this Don't stop movin' album, they have omitted some of the best tracks on the Seeing Double album (including my favourite track Love ain't gonna wait for you which so makes me want to dance!!!). Plus, the UK release includes a remix of Alive which just knocks the socks off of the original. It might cost you a bit more money to import but I would highly recommend it."
2,Just For A Report,For this book I thought it took way to long leading up to the actual game. I thought it wasn't the worst book and it is great to read for a book report. If you do read this book you should know something about football beacause that is wht the author expects. Overal this book has a low rating because of the boring ideas.
3,Quarterback Walk-on,"This book wasn't as good as some other books I've read by Mr. Dygard, but it wasn't a bad one either. I'm sure this has happened in real life to many teams, where they lose their number one and have to go to a less than sufficient back up. The ways for the team to overcome this little setback were well thought up by Dygard. Even though the action that was being described in the book wasn't as good as in his other books, he still finds a way to make the reader see what is going on and make them feel like they are there. The character of Danny Westbrook in this book will make you believe that football is not just a game of toughness and brawn, but also is a game of thinking and relys on knowledge just as much as strength."
1,Festival Records Are Lazy,"Hello, my name is Jake Burrows. Uncle Clayton is writing this review for me as I don't have an account. I'm disappointed with the way Warner have been handling the Festival Records catalog since 2004. It's been a hit and miss when I go into stores. Some stores have the CD's as discontinued and some have had them as available. There is too much messing around when I order CD's produced by Festival Records and I'm struggling to get this stupid Jimmy Little CD. I've tried ten JB Hi-Fi's and they say it's discontinued while other shops say it's not."
2,pinking blade,Not happy with it at all...it kept snagging...did not cut clean...felt like it was not sharp at all.....very dissapointed ...could not finish my project with it..
5,Olfa is the best,"I tried other brands, but Olfa seems to be the best. It takes less pressure to cut. The rotary pinking blade has replaced my pinking sheers for all sewing projects. You do get what you pay for when you invest in Olfa products. It's simply the best."
1,One Star Too Many,"The food and recipes look fabulous but alas, the recipes are unreliable. I tried the Lemon Tart ( I am an experienced cook) and it was more like sour lemon soup. I was suspicious when the recipe called for only 4 teaspoons of sugar and 1/2 cup of lemon juice so I expected it might not be sweet enough, how ever it was not only not sweet, it never thickened and the dough recipe yeilded shrinking dough! This book is one more reason why you should think twice before buying a book by a restaurant owner and professional chef. Skip it."
4,I Love This CD,"Wow, Alabama's Roll On cd is one of the best. Their Song 'If Your Gonna Play in Texas' may not compare to Charlie Daniels 'The Devil Went Down to Georgia' but it's still great for anyone who loves a good foot stompin country beat. Then, of course, are the love songs that will last forever, and 'Fire in the Night' is one of them. Its prefect for anyone who wants to cuddle with their sweetie in front of a roaring fire on a cold winter night. And lets not forget 'The End of the Lyin'. This is a good one for those who are breaking up with love. Last, but not least is 'Food on the Table', talk about a song that keeps a hard worker goin' through thee day. So whether you like to dance, love or even work. Roll On's got it for ya'."
4,Truckin' and lovin',"Exelent music for truckers and for lovers, it will take you to the country side of life and forget your real side of life"
5,A most fantastic achievement,"A most remarkable work. I've read several book about Lincol, but none have given a better personal and in depth of his intimate life. Gove Vidal's historic novel, Lincoln, give the historical picture, but in Eosteins book, we get a very close and intimate details of life in the 1850's. thus far never available.I give great prise to Epstein for his remarkabel researh. The ""quote"" and the everyday accounts of Lincols and Mary's life together and apart.Quite a remarkable undertaking indeed."
1,More unanswered questions than answers,"It seems as though Hosty&Son decided to cash in on the cottage industry that has become the JFK assassination. While revealing nothing new here, Hosty manages to continue the Warren apology in a rather boring fashion. Rest assured, there are a lot of answers concerning the death of JFK that Hosty could give us, but he doesn't here, and probably never will."
1,Clueless backing of the Warren Commission,"How many facts need to come out about the JFK assassination before the clueless Hosty admits that Oswald couldn't possibily have pulled a trigger, let alone killed the president. In this era of ever-widening disclosure, Hosty does what he can to turn back time and close the door again to the American public. It's too little too late: We're on to you and we're on to the truth."
3,Couldn't put it down,"I found Hosty's account of the events surrounding the JFK assasination to be very intesting, and highly accurate in comparison to actual film footage from that time period. This account will put to rest all of the illogical and unsubstantiated conspiracy theories that have been circulating. And, it will focus light on the one conspiracy theory that hasn't gotten enough attention, and that is the one involving the Soviet and Cuban governments. Hosty has alleged that every commission and report to date has purposely down-played or ommitted evidence pointing to a Soviet/Cuba/Oswald link. His argument is well supported with facts and analysis. He also gives a perfectly plausible reason why Oswald could certainly have fired all three shots. I highly recommend this book for students of the JFK assasination."
4,An FBI agent's point-of-view,"James Hosty was certainly an important witness to history. He was one of the few to have interviewed both Lee and Marina Oswald. His book does a good job of connecting the dots, at least from his unique, law enforcement point-of-view and would be recommended reading for any JFK assassination buff."
1,James Hosty has no credibility,"FBI agent James Hosty is the guy who destroyed critically important assassination evidence -- a written note left by Oswald at the Dallas office of the FBI, two weeks before the assassination. James Hosty admits that he destroyed Oswald's note three hours after Oswald was killed by Jack Ruby. As one who destroyed evidence, how can Hosty possibly be trusted to tell the truth about anything in this matter?"
2,Very well made... poor sound reproduction!,Bought a KC 150 online to use with my 88 key Yamaha P-85 keyboard because I wasn't happy with the quality of sound out of the two small internal speakers on the keyboard. Used them amp in a couple of small gigs and decided that the speakers in the keyboard did a better job than the amp. Sold the amp for half of what I paid for it and felt guilty about taking the money. It's a very well made product with a good variety of inputs and controls. Just very disappointed in the quality of sound it produced. If you are considering this amp I would highly recommend you listen to it before you purchase it.
5,I love u guys!,first of all i though i was there only fan in the world.... second u can contect me at gevak@hotmail.com p.s simone is still working and i have his last album its nice but nothing as good as this one!
3,Are We Happy....?,"While I personally like ""Motive"" (the second Red Box album) a lot more than this one, it's nice to see it finally get a deserved re-release.This is one of those albums that regularly went for three figures on eBay and, to be honest, I would really feel for anyone who spent that much on it. It is a good album, but I think there was a certain hysteria about the rarity aspect, but that's a different story.The album contains some absolutely corking tracks and wonderful singles, ""For America"", ""Lean On Me"", the underrated ""Heart Of The Sun"" and ""Chenko"", but also some excruciating ones. Still, it's easy to look back at this album and think of all the others, classed as ""world music"" that came after it, so I'm probably being a little unfair.At this price it's certainly worth a punt for the curious and I'll be buying it again, purely for the extras.Hopefully, some bright spark will now get on and give us an expanded ""Motive""."
5,Desert island disc,"Funny how some of the best stuff from the 80's only surfaces on jap imports. It's been 18 years since its release and it sounds every bit as brilliant as when I first heard the album in 1986. In my book, this is one of the most finely-crafted albums of the 80's, evoking a bold and dramatic range of soundscapes. A curiously engaging and effervescent blend of soulful electro-pop/rock/gospel awash in a cathedral of sound. One of my desert-island discs for all time."
3,delicate pendant,"This pendant was beautiful and appeared as pictured, but was smaller than I expected. I had searched the description for a size of the pendant, but could not find it. It is about and inch in diameter, which was a little too small for me."
2,Stoicism: What does it have to offer?,"I used this book for a paper I wrote on Stoicism.Stoicism is a complex philosophical school. However, its ideas have come to be validated by modern psychology.Everyone in America has to buck up, and not dwell on their problems. They need to realize that they do not need love, sex, money or friendship. The only thing you need is virtue. We need to stop whining about fairness; and try our best to be good people. These are some things Stoicism has to offer."
4,I like it,I got this cd in 04 after watching Generation J performing on a show hosted by Taffi and Creflo. They did good so I decided to buy the cd...I love going up Yonder! I love how they have the reggae feel and the rock at the end that song is hot!!I Give you my all is a nice smooth song that I just love.I really like Intercessory Prayer it's a well written song and I like the feel of it.Their worship melody is nice but it doesn't sound as good as the original by kurt carr but they sound good...Overall I really like this cd and I wish they were more popular because people don't really know about them.
5,Generation J- Secret Place review,"If you take 4 young talented, anointed and well trained singers and add hip hop, raggae, urban contemporary, worship and ""tight"" harmonies=Generation J. This is one of the best debuts I have ever listened to. This group sounds as if they have been around for a long time. This is a ""must have CD"". It's been in my car CD player for a week now. This is good listening for everyone. I don't think you will be disappointed, every song is well done. Check out the ""tight harmonies"" on the Praise Medley and Jesus Loves Me accapello. Get it!!!!!!!!!"
1,WISDOMSEEKER,"There was only one good song on this album (The first one was interesting) so that's where the one star comes from, which means I could sum it up in two words ""It Stinks!!!"". If you are wondering why you haven't heard of this group its for that reason. First off, the songs are way to contemporary not to mention useless. Gospel music even contemporary music ( KiKi Sheard, Fred Hammond, J Moss) should make you feel good. This album only made me angry because of how terrible it was. If your looking to venture into the contemporary gospel areana check out the Singleton's and Shea Norman, they are produced by Fred Hammond or Tye Tribett, J Moss, KiKi, and Fortitude. That's some good Contemporary!!!"
3,"POLAROID good price, bad machine","I bought this DVD player for [...] with a[..] rebate, and it was the same price as other 8"" or 9"" players so I thought I was getting a good deal. It had all the features I wanted: dual headphones, car charger, Lithium battery, remote, ""car bag"" but it just didn't work. The screen is great- I highly recommend 10"" because it is more like watching at home. But when I watched movies the sound was off from the video and it was annoying, especially in closeups. Plus the ""car bag"" is not what you think- it wasn't a nice suitcase-style DVD player case that can be installed in the car and left. It was like an envelope: once you put the player in it you can't change DVDs without removing it, and it's a tight fit. A reguar DVD plaver case cost me an additional $40 on sale, and this player is big it wouldn't fit into the cheap Wal-Mart one."
1,buyer beware,"polaroid players do not play all dvd's. evidently they have a ""coding"" problems which they are well aware of but don't bother to reveal.......no wonder they are in the financial basement."
2,It's okay,"The only thing I really like about this product is the 10"" screen .It's too gaudy and akward to handle . The disk is hard to remove because of the small space provided for your finger to fit into to remove it . The door you have to open to load the disk is way to big. Picture quality is good . Sound is fair . I use this product only once and a blue . But I'm sure someone who may use it often would have a problem with the single hinge in the middle . Unless you left it mounted in your car ..."
4,Classic Eric from days gone by.,Eric and his all-star quartet play a few originals and some classics like it never was.
4,One of my son's favorite books,"Great book. I have read to my 3 year old son a hundred times, he loves it and it has letters from A-Z. Not your normal book for pre-schoolers because it's interesting for adults too. I am giving it for XMas gifts to nephews."
5,love it,"This book--charming, irreverent, quirky, and beautifully illustrated--is a big hit with my 4-year-old and everyone in his preschool class loved it when he brought it in to share. It ended up staying at preschool for a couple of days so all the kids could enjoy it."
3,Loved it but,"had to cut open a couple of pages so they were not even with the rest of the book, but loved the content. Great story, wonderful illustrations."
2,not for me,"I must say I really don't enjoy this book. I can't quite place my finger on it, but I find myself hoping that my son does not choose it to read. Really just not one for me."

4,wonderful!,I love foreign films and this one was great...they always seem to be a little edgy but this is why I find then so interesting!
4,a good movie,"I liked this movie The men were nice looking, They faces different obstacles and overcame them to share their love for each other."
2,Stringing along,"The young male lovers are beautiful and sexy. In fact this movie is full of sexy hot Arab guys on the make. Claudia Cardinale is fabulous though her teeth are ""horreeblay""! The sets and scenery are often breathtaking. I especially like the close up view of the street life and male hustlers in Tunis. Too bad the story is shallow, disjointed, and unconvincing. The scenes hop around a lot and the characters are undeveloped leaving the viewer frustrated and confused while the neat happy ending is a bit too contrived."
4,Puts together many aspects of the gay life,It is a very nice movie. It puts together different aspects of the gay live in a community full of cultural/ethnic values and prejudices. It shows how difficult it is to born in a Muslim country and at the same time be a gay person. This movie is very much what is happening right now in many Islamic and Hindu countries where gay people are obliged to get marry in order to preserve the family's tradition.
2,Not as good as we'd hoped,"We bought this movie along with a few others. Yes, we were looking for the next ""Brokeback Mountain"". And no, this wasn't it.The story never really goes anywhere. We were also hoping that this would show the Islamic struggle with homosexuality. But this movie is all about the French, non-Islamic character.All in all, this movie will probably be given away to someone else. It's not a ""keeper"" for us."
4,Pleasantly Surprised,"This was a nice film. I read some of the other reviews and thought I'd give it a try and I'm glad I did. I half expected more negativity from the Muslim perspective, and was surprised to see that wasn't the focus of the film. It was a tad choppy at certain parts, but overall pretty well done. I'm not sure if I would use the words ""torridly romantic"" as is used in the description....... I would call it a nice gay romance story with a happy ending. Who doesn't like that? Worth the 3 bucks to rent it."
2,lighting it up,"These lighs are not as good as they claim, the glass is very very fragile. And when plugging them in or when removing them they will break at the joint. And they only last about a year in my case."
2,Description,"I found this description on another site.Color Fountain Mixer & Color Splash Bath TabletsEven bath haters can't resist our floating fountain bath toy--complete with rainbow bath fizzies! It draws water from the tub, then squirts it up. Add a fizzy tablet or two, and change the water's color. 24 assorted tablets included; 24-count refills sold separately. Color mixing guide included. Safe, non-toxic. Requires 2 ""AAA"" batteries (sold separately). For ages 3 and up."
4,a very thrilling detective story,"Killer in the Rain is a very thrilling and interesting detective story. It was one of the best stories I have ever read! It is quite easy to read.The story is about a detective who has to supervise a woman by meeting another man. Then a mysterious murder happens in the house where the woman is staying. From the first to last page you have to guess who the murderer is. The book is not boring because it is not very long. There aren't a lot of people in the story, so it is easy to understand the plot. I liked this book very much and I can recommand it to fans of detective stories."
3,a mixed bag of short stories...,"Okay, Raymond Chandler is a legend. I have read most of his novels and enjoyed all or nearly all of them. However in 'Killer in the Rain' we have several short stories written by Chandler in the 1930s to early 1940s. These stories all have a private investigator solving some crime, typically involving murder. Invariably the investigator gets beaten up, shot at, or both. In most of the stories the language used is almost comically ""tough guy"", to the point you'd want to use some Google translate function. In truth I found all but the last two stories forgettable. However the last two toned down the ridiculous tough guy dialog and were set in the mountains of southern California (..perhaps the rural setting made the author settle on typical American English dialog?). These stories were very good, although they certainly didn't make up for the other duds.Bottom line: for Chandler diehard fans only."
5,Lovely sheets!,"The 600tc burgundy sheets are very pretty, and feel great. Nice quality and great price!"
5,This Book is a Teaching Tool,"I am currently involved with teacher training in the area of reading. I have been trained through the Aft's ER&D Program in Early Reading Intervention. In this module, teachers reflect on the research on phonemic awareness and how this impacts reading instruction. One of the skills we share with teachers is a strategy called ""Word Building"". When I saw ""Andy: That's My Name"" I knew this would be a perfect book to use in my workshops. Teachers really enjoyed the book and I know we will continue to use it in our workshops. It shows children that making words can be fun! Great book!"
5,Brake MC,I works good. I have no issues with it at all. I bought this for my cafe racer build and it works as expected. The adjustable position is a nice addition to the lever. If you need an affordable MC buy this one.
5,great for other things as well,"I bought the largest size SILPAT so that it almost covers my 30"" smooth top range. I use for mixing and kneading all kinds of dough and It works great, When I am finished, I shake it off and roll it up. I just love it. I need to get the jelly roll size for my baking sheets as well"
1,It's a scam,"This item is a 5"" x 9"" empty plastic bag. There is no silicon baking mat; just a small, empty plastic bag that is too small to have ever contained the product. The baking mat is a lie."
5,Silpat Fun,Through the years I've used my Silpat for all kinds of baking and it's still look and preforms like new. I purchased this for my daughter so the traditions continue at her home. Highly recommended!
5,A nice product,"I didn't really know what to expect when I ordered this--I knew it was not exactly what I wanted, but I also really wanted a silicone baking sheet. This works really well, fits a jelly roll pan easily. Nothing sticks to it, so clean up is a breeze. I'll probably get again to give as a shower gift or part of a wedding present, as it is unique and it works!"
5,Made a great gift!,"Mom loves it! I'm sure that once she makes me a batch of cookies, I'll love it too! Woo hoo!"
4,Wow!,"After seeing Tae Guk GI, I really got interested in foreign movies. This happened to be one that I picked up. My reactions towards this movie are mixed. Don't get me wrong, this is a great movie. It's just that it really isn't a single movie, it's more like two movies combined into one. The first half of the movie is about the civil war fought in China in 1948 (I think, I don't know too much about Chinese history). The second half, is more of a drama about the aftermath with a few political sidenotes here and there.That said, I did enjoy the movie. It does have its' flaws (mainly weak character development), but they're easy to forgive given the chaotic war of the first half and the intriguing drama of the second half.4/5"
4,"Good amount of material, but nothing completely new","Bruce's Man of Sorrow's single is probably a little high priced unless you are a completist. It contains the Man of Sorrows Orchestral version, which basically dolls up the middle with a string arrangement, the Man of Sorrows Spanish version, where Bruce sings the whole tune in Spanish, as translated by Roy Z. This is one of the highlights to this 5 song disc, as its both interesting to hear how it was translated (pretty basic if you know a little spanish - the title in Spanish translating to the very simple 'Sad Man', and lyrics are included) and to hear Bruce annunciate his Español. There are also two demos from the Accident of Birth sessions on this album, Darkside of Aquarius, where nothing too new is going on, and the surprisingly fresh sounding Arc of Space, where Bruce accompianied by a much more unrestrained acoustic guitar provide a great listen. I like this CD, I just wish some sort of new song was included with it for the price."
5,COOL!!!,yeah i just bought this from here and its amazing its cheep and awsome it rides really smoothly and the set up was kinda hard cuz i didnt know how to install the chain but i found out how to on youtube so get it great perchase it wont be at this price for long.
4,I love it!,"I got the Magic Bullet last month for a birthday gift and I LOVE it! I was completely amazed by the infomercials, and am even more amazed at the product itself. It does everything just as easily as shown in the advertisments, with the exception if the juicer, which is admittedly a piece of crap and isn't worth the material it's made of.It grated cheese into a perfect size, whipped up sorbets and mousses, and is awesome for frozen drinks. It met my expectations, and I totally recommend it. (especially for poor students like myself who need to re-invent their leftovers to minimize your food costs)However, it does have its downfalls. I only gave it a 4 out of 5 star rating because a) It is kind of over-priced, and b) The motor burns out if used for more than 60 seconds at a time, which makes you ultra-worried when using it (especially since its not cheap to replace)."
3,Thought I was happy,"I bought a Magic Bullet and have used it for over 6 months, but I only used the blender cups and made smoothies. I had a smoothie recipie that was larger than the blender cup so I thought I would use the blender jar attachment. As it turned out, when I put the blender jar in the base, it held the under side of the base up too high and within seconds, I had sheared the turning blades off the bottom of the base, rendering the upright blade unit useless. I switched to the flat blade and that was fine for another few weeks, until it also sheared the underside of the flatblade base level and therefore useless. I think the bullet is a great little machine, but it has some bugs in it that need to be worked out."
2,Be ready for it to break,"Within two months of purchasing it, the plastic gears attached to the blade were significantly worn. Within five months, the blades were useless.We contacted the manufacturer. Replies came three - five days after our contacts. Because we didn't save the receipt, they wanted us to pay for a replacement bladeCheck Consumer Reports. I should have. They list more durable personal blenders."
2,"It's not what is advertised, that's for sure!","I got this for Christmas, and also gave it as a Christmas gift and almost feel bad about it. I make alot of smoothies and for this is it ALMOST perfect. (Sometimes it leaks) Anything else that I have put in to it though has turned to mush. A regular smoothie maker does the same job for a lower price. However, this is easy to clean up.I won't replace it when it breaks."
4,Magic Bullet Express works,"I really enjoy my Magic Bullet Express , I bought it mainly to fix drinks, smooth out lumpy sauces and so on. I tried to chop green peppers, but what I wanted is just as fast if done by hand (with more control). The Magic Bullet Express is easy to use, even for kids with supervision!At this time, I have no complaints"
2,Don't buy it.,"Sadly, I join the chorus of dissatisfied customers on this page whose black rubber seal thing broke. I bet all those who rated it five stars are new owners of the Magic Bullet. I mean, yeah it's good if it were not guaranteed to break, and if the company honors the warranty. But that's not the case.The juicer was pretty bad. I never got a full glass of juice from the thing, and it's a really hard to clean. I tried using it several times, but eventually just gave up. It now lives in my garage.The blender/chopper is ok. Usually, I find that it's TOO powerful. Everything basically turns to liquidy mush. And the machine chops unevenly, so the stuff on top is chunky while the stuff on the bottom is mushy.But all that doesn't even matter because since the rubber thing broke, I can't blend/mush liquids, or it'll leak. These days, I use the machine primarily to grind my coffee beans every morning, and it does a good job at that. So it gets two stars."
4,love it - wish it lasted longer,I absolutely LOVE the Magic Bullet. It is the one kitchen appliance I can't live without. HOWEVER - I have had two Magic Bullet bases break down on me in the past 1 1/2 years. I wish it would last longer - but I am such a fan that I will keep buying replacements no matter what.
1,It didn't last two weeks,"I got this as a gift, and I was very excited. I had high expectations. But it's loud, it does not replace my food processor (it doesn't 'chop' anything, it just makes it into a smoothie), it is dishwasher safe, but after you wash it in the dishwasher the parts that make the blade move just kind of grind down until its totally useless. I am very disappointed. A regular blender, and a food processor is all you need."
1,A piece of junk,"GO BUY A BLENDER. PLAIN AND SIMPLE. The idea of the blending and chopping all those foods is an excellent idea. However use a blender or Jack La Lanne's power juicer. I feel stupid buying this dum thing. Common sense - If you want to blend fruit, veggies or whatever a larger blender has a large motor and is much more powerful. If you want to chop hard items well look at the previous sentence. The Jack La Lanne's power juicer is best if you want to separate the pulp from the juice. Much more juice comes out of this power juicer, even a non Jack La Lanne's power juicer does better then this piece of junk. The person inventing this had an excellent idea in easy cook and health making in just blending and chopping everything together. I came up with that myself. It is amazing to resolve all that chewing and chopping. It is a great idea however the person inventing this had to come up with something or some product so people will buy his idea."
1,THIS BULLET BITES!!!,"don't waste your money on the cheap product...i used it twice and returned it right away, the blades are sharp, the screws used to hold them stripped after trying to make a smoothie....don't waste your money....cheap plastic, the motor overheats...cheap piece of crap"
1,Nice idea but poorly made,"My Magic Bullet worked fine for about a month. Then, the motor started to lag and overheat if I put anything other than soft fruit in it. I could no longer make a smoothie with frozen fruit or ice and forget about chopping nuts, grinding coffe or grating hard cheese. IF this product had a durable, long lasting motor in it, it would be a great thing to have in a kitchen. As it is, it's overpriced and almost useless."
4,Convenient and Easy to use,"I own the expensive Vita-Mix and a juicer and now the MB. Ofcourse, the MB is not as powerful as the Vita-Mix or Juicer, but I use it a lot more. I haven't touch the VM in years. What I like about the MB is that it is small, quick and easy to clean, especially if you're making a smoothie or soup for just one or two people. I hated how much space the VM took up on my kitchen counter. It was too much cleaning and work for making a drink for just one person. Bottom line, VM is great for making things in large quanity, MB is perfect for the single person use."
2,Not-So-Magic Bullet,"I honestly love this product. I have even bought it twice because I am so dependant upon it. That's the problem. They only seem to last for about a year. It makes excellent smoothies, protein drinks, and coffee drinks. However it does not chop vegetables well, make salsa, or anything like that. The plastic pieces do break in the mechanism and it is impossible to fix. So, sadly, my second bullet has broken and I am once again without a bullet!"
2,Big Let-Down,"This is nothing like the info-mercial. The Juicer is a piece of crap. If you bought this to make your own fresh juice you wasted you money. I tried to make salsa... several times and followed the directions to a ""T"", and it came out like soup! It does make a gool milkshake, but so does my regular blender. Very expensive shipping for a 2 week delivery time. I ordered this from the company...Should have ordered from Amazon so I would have wasted a little less money. My recommendation is dont but this and save your money."
1,Not a food processor,"Bought the product for its versitality and hoping to eliminate a few appliances. As a food processor it turns everything to mush, even with the pulse method. Food does not drop into the blades so the stuff at bottom gets whipped. I tried the salsa several times and in the end I did all the chopping. I had a small food processor for about 8 yrs before it finally gave out on me. I can do smoothies fine with my Kalorik stick mixer. Kept having to shake it to have the food drop into the blades. might as well use a regular blender with out so many troubles. I will returning this to the store."
2,On my 3rd bullet,"I loved the bullet, it did what I wanted it too and I love making things with it, but if you blend for more than 3 secs at a time it starts smoking. My first one broke within a year, but I didnt return it. Later on I bought another one. That one broke after a couple of months so I returned it to the store for a brand new one. I take good care of my things but now being even more careful with this one as I dont see it having much life left to it. I wont buy another one."
1,Magic Bullet,"I thought the Magic Bullet was great, we made alot of smoothies with it with a mixture of fresh and frozen fruit. After about 3 months of occasional use the motor seized up. I can not find my reciept so I guess I am out my 65.00 and my Magic Bullet. I am very disappointed with the product."
2,Beware of the replicate product!,"I bought one from the market place seller, and it turned out to be a replicate. There is no UPC on the box, no warranty card and the recipes book is copied version. The product work while for couple of months with light used, it then smoke and the plastic on the motor and the blade started to break..The product is very good for making Smoothie..May be the original version would work better and last longer.."
1,Product Doesn't Work,It leaked and didn't grand anything. Weak motor. Poor excuse for a kitchen gadget.
4,"Useful, but not a blender.","I got this as a wedding gift, it sat in the box for the first year. It is very useful as several people have mentioned for smoothies and things of that nature. I've used it to grind spices as well and did a very good job. I don't give this product 5 stars because well, it's not a blender - I don't want to make individual margaritas if I have friends over or make the same smoothie three times so that everyone can have one. I am not sure if they make an attachement that would allow for larger batches to be made but that would take this review from 4 stars to 5. I am updating this because I discovered that it does come with a blender attachment. So that fixes the issue I thought I had before. Still not giving it the 5 stars since it doesn't have all the settings a blender does but it is a pretty strong and useful little kitchen gadget."
1,Very poor value!,"I bought this item because it seemed like a great time saver and would be a great help in making meals. WRONG!!!! When you attempt to chop an item, some portions of it are pulverized while other portions of the same batch are left in chunks. I tried the sorbet, it came out with chunks of ice remaining. I tried salsa and the end product was not appealing at all. When I called their customer service, I was treated VERY rudely and told I was stuck with it. Needless to say, I'm not a happy customer."
2,I loved it while it lasted,It just didn't last very long. The glasses started splitting and the motor gave out. I would definitely want another set if it was more reliable.
1,MORE PROBLEMS THAN ITS WORTH.,"I was given this as a gift and so glad I didn't fork out any money for it because its a joke.I have tried to do three things with it and all three were total failures.Tried to chop up peanuts, make chicken salad, make guacamole.The nuts didn't get chopped up well enough, the chicken salad got stuck and wouldn't blend and the same thing happened to the avacado.If the loading of the items is so precise the thing is not desinged very well. You will spend all of your time opening and repositioning the items to get them blended.Also the rubber gear on the bottom continues to become engaged and disengaged by the pressing motion and grinds the rubber down so you have disintergrated rubber flakes to clean up when you are done, not to mention the burnt rubber smell in your kitchen.Do not buy this thing it is a total foist on consumers."
5,Love my Magic Bullet,"The magic Bullet is fantastic. This is the second one that I have bought. The first for myself and the second most recently purchased for my Grandmother.This little machine sits permanantly on my countertop. It's very useful in everyday recipes, and for individual cocktails.My only complaints would be that it's VERY loud, and it doesn't really cut things into chunks like it advertises. It's either mush or nothing, but that's ok for the things that I use it for."
3,Magic Bullet not so magical,The product is nice and looks exactly as advertised. The processing however dosen't always grind up evenly. For example onions may not be chopped small while in the same batch the rest is almost too finely ground. It does do a great job on ice. It is much better than a coffee grinder or blender mounted chopper. Clean up is easy.
1,Hard to get parts,"My son received this product last year as a high school graduation present and used it in college and liked it. During the move home, he lost the high torque power base. I can't get a replacement power base unless I have a receipt (was gift) or the number on the bottom of the base (which is gone). So, make sure you write the base number down somewhere or keep the receipt. Homeland Housewares were not helpful at all and he will just buy a blender to replace this. I am very disappointed that you can't get replacement parts."
1,Don't buy this piece of junk.,Should be called smoke and mirrors not magic bullet. The magic part is that people keep buying this crap. It's junk my smoke and mirrors slug died after 6 weeks. Because I didn't buy it from the mfg. they would not honor the warranty. I bought it on that buyer beware auction site and the seller would not honor the warranty either. Buy a Kitchen Aid or Oster blender it will last forever and you wont be giving your hard earned money to crooks.
3,Good cheap mixer,"Amazon had the best price for this, bought it for a Christmas present. Haven't heard any complaints about it."
1,save your money,only lasted 3 months and motor stopped working! while it was working wouldn't even blend smoothies well. it left chunks of fruit and even sherbet. it is not worth the money.
4,Magic Bullet,This bullet is great especially when all the kids want a different flavor milk shake. Makes great hummus and so many other foods. Would definitely recommend it.
3,I'm looking for something better,"Like many other reviewers, I'm not really impressed by the Magic Bullet. The tabs on the plastic cups broke after a couple uses so they didn't engage the mechanism to start the motor. We take the rubber gaskets off evertime to clean, which isn't a problem but they started to crack and break... now we're down to only one. In my opinion, there's too much plastic and the whole thing is rattling it's life away. I don't expect it to last much longer.On the upside, it chopped pretty good when it was in its prime."
3,"Working good but, the silicon Gasket in the mixer was broken the third day of use it.","Bad, and broken Seal or gasket in the mixer area. I need two to make a replacement whit a new one and keep one like spare.The rest of mixer work good.Thanks."
3,Not as good as Torpedo Bullet,"A couple years back I bought a Nu-Wave Oven and with it comes the Torpedo Bullet - which I found easy to use and it was very powerful. I needed to buy another one for our other house and found unhappily that the Torpedo is not available for serparate purchase so I bought this product, the magic bullet.I found that it takes forever to seat the container so that it will turn on. I have to take it out and reseat it two or three times. I also found it does not chop nearly as fine as the Nu-Wave Torpedo - sort of a coarse grind when grinding carrots. If you want to make a smoothie you are talking about blending close to or exceeding the one minute recommendation.I love all the extra containers it comes with though.[...]"
4,"Good Blender ,for express jobs.","This item is good for quick job, when you are on the run. Is perfect for smoothies.Easy to use and to clean up is quick."
1,magic bullet: just an illusion,this product works nothing like they show on t.v. It won't even mix the most basic ingridients together. I would not ever recommend this product to anyone.
1,Do not buy this over priced junk.,The first problem is it's almost all plastic. The second problem is that unless you buy it from the manufacture there is now warranty. My Magic slug stripped a gear after 6 weeks. Nither the mfg. or the seller would honor the warranty. I got on that buyer beware auction site. Big supprise. I wish I could put in some nice epletives to further descirbe this piece of junk but this is a PG rated web site.
2,Magic Bullet is a Bust!,"I just received my Magic Bullet, and immediately put it to the test. Needless to say, I wasn't impressed. The salsa I tried to made came out soupy. The soft cheddar cheese I ""grated"" turned into cheese mush. I tried to make a milkshake using milk and ice cream, and it took a long time for the ice cream to blend with the milk. I wound up with a lump of ice cream at the bottom of my glass. I made some chicken salad, using half of a grilled chicken breast, a couple pearl onions, clove of garlic, and a few teaspoons of mayo. It came out very watery-looking and almost soupy, but it did taste pretty good.(...)"
1,DON'T BUY THE MAGIC BULLET!,"DON'T BUY THE MAGIC BULLET!! WHAT A RIP OFF! I HOPE THE MAKERS OF THIS PRODUCT GET SUED AND LOOSE EVERYTHING! I FEEL CONNED AND A VICTUM OF FALSE ADVERTISING. IT DOES NOT PERFORM AND CHOP AS THEY ADVERTISE ON THEIR INFOMERCIAL. I FOLLOWED THE INSTRUCTIONS AND RECIPES AND IT DOES NOT CHOP VEGETABLES, GARLIC, TOMATOES... BUT IF YOU LIKE MUSH AND MASH IT DOES THAT TO PART OF THE INGREDIENTS AND THEN IT QUITS. THE PLASTIC PARTS DO NOT MAKE A GOOD CONTACT SO THE BLADES DO NOT CONTINUELY SPIN. WHAT A PIECE OF JUNK. AND IT COST $189.00 WITH THE ADDED SHIPPING AND HANDLING WHICH YOU DO NOT GET BACK. I FEEL A CRIME HAS BEEN COMMITTED AND THIS IS FRUAD....PLEASE BELIEVE ME..... DON'T BUY THIS. I AM A QUADRAPELEAGIC AND BOUGHT THIS TO HELP BE A PART OF DOING MY FAVORITE HOBBY AGAIN OF COOKING AND TO MAKE ME FEEL MORE INDEPENDANT AGAIN. I FEEL TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF. SHAME ON YOU HOMELAND HOUSEWARES AND ANYONE WHO ENDORSES THIS PRODUCT."
2,All the bad reviews aren't from uneducated people,"After purchasing the product and reading many reviews, it seems that perhaps the blades are just made differently. I followed the instructions to a tee, including ingredient order, using liquids, using small ice cubes, following their recipes, pulsing, etc etc. But it will NOT crush all the ice for smoothies - it leaves big chunks that it just kicks around in the cup. I have to blame this on the blade more than anything else. It seems very inconsistent.Tried chopping some onions - used pulse and tap and everything else - ending up with half pureed onions and half unchopped onions after 5 minutes of tapping, pulsing, etc etc.Biggest problem I have - doesn't perform as in the commercial. Definite trickery going on there. Smoothies aren't smooth, vegetables don't chop right even when following all of their pulses/taps, etc.Great idea, poor execution."
3,"Ok, just, ok","The Magic Bullet is ok, just ok. I received it and one of the rubber caps from the inside came off on my first use. I replaced it and was pleasantly surprised that it worked well UNTIL. A couple of nights ago, I used it to make a slushy pop and the blender cap unloosened and ice and pop ended up all over the counter. Last night I tried to juice some beets, carrots, celery and the cap unloosened and I ended up with a mess everywhere. I will say that after I cleaned it up, the MB continued to work. It does not do very well with chicken salads nor a lot of ice cubes. I love the idea that clean up is so easy, but as others have stated, the tapping never occurs on television and you constantly have to do this or foodstuffs don't mix properly. I also questioned the higher than normal s/h but now know it is to prevent returing it. Inspite of all my complaints, it still has some merit in that it is fast, clean up is easier than most blenders and it is compact."
2,I won't fall for another infomercial!,"I'm pretty disappointed by the Magic Bullet. I bought directly from their website, 2 for $99.99 and $40 in shipping?!?!?!?!?What a rip off!It doesn't blend ice. If I make a smoothie with frozen strawberries it leaves them whole and mushes everything else up. The juicer is laughable.Don't buy the Bullet! Invest in a decent blender for less money!"
4,I LOVE THE MAGIC BULLET,"I love my Magic Bullet!! I use it every day to make healthy smoothies after my workout and it is great. I convinced my daughter to buy one and she did have a problem with 2 motors burning up on her within a few weeks. She was able to return them and get them replaced. She loves it also. I've had mine for 3 months and it is starting to have a funny smell sometimes. It also sounds different than it use to so I don't know if I'm going to have problems with it. I use the pulsing technique but I'm still not sure if the motor is getting weak already. Once this glitch is worked out, I think it will deserve 5 stars."
2,Magic Bullet A Disapointment,"I tried salsa, and even though I followed instruction, putting the items in the cup in the order they list, it was mush by the time all the ingredients were incorporated. Same with the chicken salad recipe by the time the apples were mixed in the chicken was mush. The smoothy I made was nice, and the quacamole was pretty good, but overall I'm anything but thrilled with the product. As with most products you see on infomercials, the Magic Bullet just doesn't seem to work the way it does for ol' Mick and Mimi."
4,Makes great smoothies and drinks,"I've only used mine to make drinks but it's been great. I make strawberry smoothies with milk and frozen berries and they are always completely mixed - no chunks of berries. Also have made daquiris and margaritas.. It does a great job of crushing ice in smoothies. I love not getting out the big blender and cleaning it is a breeze. I usually blend for a few seconds then take it off the stand and give it a couple of shakes before finishing the blending. Have had it for about 2 months now without any problems. The party mugs are a great idea if you have company over since you can blend right in the cup. Since I haven't tried using it for chopping, etc. I am only giving it 4 stars but it is definitely a 5 star product to me for making blended drinks."
3,Disappointing... partly,"I so wanted to be one of those people who said, ""Just read the directions and it works fine!"" Well, I am a compulsive direction-reader and -follower, and I don't know how these people have the nerve to say this is a juicer. There is no way to make apple juice using this machine, even though there is an apple juice recipe in the cookbook.I do like the way it whips up frothy drinks, and I have hope that I will find other uses for it. I love the way you can use different cups and caps for blending, microwaving, and storage. Now that is cool."
2,Used to love it,"I got this as a gift in May 07. Used it to make post-workout protein shakes. I used to rave about this thing to my friends but slowly my loyalty to this product waned. It would sometimes leave me with chunks of ice to my surprise (choke). Top would come loose mid-blend and spill a nice milky protein soup into the motor. Tabs broke. This morning I went to make my normal shake and the motor is DOA. so now my protein powder, banana, milk, ice, honey, and peanut butter mix are nestled together in the magic bullet cup in the fridge. Going to buy a blender today. Don't buy it...borrow it."
2,Time to bite the bullet,"The magic bullet is a wonderful item to have, however the durability of the product is questionable. I did not use my magic bullet on a regular basis but I did use it. I had a component break just after the warranty expired. The cost for the replacement part was close to the cost of a new one. The price would be justified if they were built to last, in my case that was not so. My best advice would be wait until there is a good sale and then use them often before the warranty expires."
2,Mine broke.... Unsatisfied.....,"There is a Plastic gear on top of the base unit that can break easily, if you run it for too long it makes a burning smell. I can not recommend this unit."
1,Warranty is a joke,"The warranty for the Magic Bullet is awful. If you get it as a gift, Hope that the person giving the gift bought it the same day they give it.After several e-mails pictures etc. I was informed since the gift was bought in October, but not given until Christmas, had no warranty after October even though it was not used until 12/25. The cost of the bullet at that time was 99.00. The base can be replaced for $20.00 (including shipping and handling). Many people who use the Bullet states it only lasts a year. If you buy it you are getting robbed. It is amazing now they advertize buy one get one free. Seems like it saves you shipping and handling when the 1st one goes."
2,Useful while it lasts,"I have owned 3 of these machines. The reason is because they are fabulous to make protein smoothies with half-frozen fruit & juice & protein powder, but they also burn out pretty quickly. I have tried blenders & stick-blenders, but nothing quite does the same thing as efficiently as the Magic Bullet. Maybe the motor needs to be more powerful. Until then, I will just continue placing it on my annual christmas list for the kids to buy me."
2,Don't waste your money!,"My husband bought me the Magic Bullet for Christmas. He paid $60 for it at a department store. At first I was so impressed by it. We used it almost every day. When we had our first baby I used it to make homemade baby food to save money. I will honestly say that it does work very well....AT FIRST. You'll love it, then be disappointed when it breaks. Before 1 year was up the motor died and it stopped working. This also happened to three of my friends who bought the magic bullet. The customer service stinks and they won't replace it. In my opinion, $60 for 1 year of use is not worth it. You'd be better off spending less on a generic brand blender that does the same thing. I bought a less expensive brand on sale for $15 and so far it works just as well as the Magic Bullet for a fraction of the price!"
1,"It's not that ""magic"" as advertised in the TV show.","I feel a little bit upset by the final outcome of this machine after I have been driving over 1 hour to the department store, paid over $60 bucks after tax and bought it back to my home.When I tried it for the first time, I don't like it immediately. After all, it's no difference as a normal blender! I tried to ""chopped"" the garlic as shown in the TV by the hosts, but I only got the ""liquified"" garlic after pushing so many times. It's not that convenient as I thought. So I decided to return it."
2,I really wanted to love this product. . .,". . . especially after reading everyone else's reviews. However, one of the main reasons I got it was to make frozen drinks (I use frozen fruit) for my kids. It seriously did not chop the frozen fruit at all until about 3 minutes of off-on-pulse-etc.(which can obviously destroy the motor). I had to take a knife and coarsely chop the berries myself, then put them back in. These were berries! Already small! Anyway, I'm glad so many other people enjoy it, but if I wanted to chop things with a knife, I wouldn't have bought it. Sadly, it goes back to the store today."
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
2,Disposable Product,"I've owned the magic bullet for about 2 years and enjoyed using it. I now must add it to the landfill. The gear in the center of the base is made out of cheap plastic and the threads that hold it on have stripped out and the gear busted into 3 pieces. (And I have not used it with anything like the frequency they tout in their infomercials.) After contacting the company, I was informed that they will not sell me this piece or repair my base. What a waste - I won't be purchasing from them again. Instead I'll be investing in a better piece of equipment.Also the juicer attachment is worthless - maybe you can use it for citrus, but who needs a juicer for citrus."
4,magic bullet,"product recommended by friends and we like it too. lots of recipes for dishes i would have never dreamed of making with this product. so far, great smoothies. easy to use and EASY to clean."
3,It's just ok,"I got the Magic Bullet on the recommendation of a good friend. She said she likes to mix pineapple and ice together and it tastes like shave ice from the fair. She really was excited about it so I thought it was the greatest thing to come down the pike. I got it, tried frozen fruit and it was just ok. Nothing special. I tried the frozen mocha and it was just ok. Nothing spectacular. I will use it from time to time but its just another appliance in the cupboard."
4,"GREAT for quick smoothies, that's about it...","I use this almost daily for quick and convenient smoothies including chopped frozen strawberries, blueberries, rasberries, kefir, and grape juice.Takes all of about 60 seconds including rinsing off the cutting head.1st one broke after about 6 months. Second one has lasted about 2 years so far.I am not aware of any other products that are as convenient for smoothies."
2,Power base stopped working,"I got this just before Christmas, and I loved it. I just quickly wash the blades, and screw on another cup, so I can make several things more easily. So, great for making baby food. But for no reason, I was chopping bread&boiled; egg yolks together with some herbs, and I did not run it for more than 30 seconds, it stopped working. Apparently if you google up, a LOT of people has problems with their power base. It burns out easily!Waste of money. Just get a small blender."
3,Magic Bullet,"I love the unit for its convience, but it would have been nice to just buy the unit and maybe one cup if I had the option, all the other things will get lost in my attic. The one improvement would be more power, while mixing my shakes with as little as one banana the unit slows down, so more power is what I miss. I would buy another, but less gadgets, put one out for the runner who is in a hurry and only needs minimum."
2,have not bought yet,I was watching the infommercial and my little boy changed the channel. I could not go back and find it and then thought I would look on the internet. I found the website and could not order from there and then I was given a phone number ~ wrong one again. They had never heard of the product. Thank you so much Amazon for saving me from buying yet another bad gadget. What the one guy described as having to hit the jar and it overheating. I have way too many of those gadgets already. You saved me a bad shopping experience. The more I shop Amazon the happier I am. How impressive that a company even lets people vent about their company if they had a bad experience and they post it...way to go.
1,Buy one and bite the bullet,"I was impressed by the claims on the TV, but after reading the reviews from fellow consumers its clear this is a piece of junk"
5,"5 Stars for the Infomercial, 1 Star for the Product","If you have not seen the infomercial, you're missing out! The characters are absolutely hilarious:Mick: British guy that shows everyone how the Magic Bullet works/Favorite Saying: OUTSTANDING!Mimi: Ecstatic girl that also shows how the Magic Bullet Works/Favorite Saying: OOOOOOOOOOORRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR...Berman: Fat, bald, and sarcastic loser that thinks that everyone thing is horrible/ Favorite Saying: Yuck, I hate brocolli!Ethal: The old, weird-looking lady with crazy hair, pajamas, and a cigarette always in her mouth/Favorite Saying: Dinner's always a production!And the Others: 2 other fat guys, an ugly-looking lady that smiles at everything, and a lady that always believes that her kids will ""never know"".Not only that, but add it with HORRIBLE acting, disgusting food, and the Magic Bullet itself and you get an ""Outstanding!"" for the infomercial!But a ""Yuck, I hate the Magic Bullet!"" for the product..."
2,Love IT,THis is such a great product and the price here was unbeatable. I would definately recommend it. This is one thing that I really do use all the time.
3,The not-so-magic bullet!,"I have watched the infomercial a gazillion times. I love it. I fall for it even after I have used the product, which I might add is just okay. The salsa doesn't turn out the way it is shown on TV. Believe. Me. I have tried plenty of times. After using it for while (like five uses) it's acting funny. I am so disappointed and wish I could get my money back."
4,great value!!!,"I just received my MB in the mail the other day.Although it is, basically, just a small food processor; I still think it's is a great product. I am a student and I make my meals in this all the time now. The cups are big enough only for single servings; but the clean-up is so easy that you can do things 2 or 3 times if you want more.Also, it's sometimes better this way if you're making something for more than one person. This way everyone gets what they want how they want it. And it is so easy to use, everyone can make their own meals/drinks.The only thing I dislike is that on TV, it was advretized as buy one get one free...which seems like an excellent value for the $100. However, in small print, the shipping is $30 PER UNIT! That's my only problem so far though.This machine is excellent and I'd reccommend it to anyone who is picky about what is in their foods and any student living away from home!"
2,motor gave out,"this product was great for a little while. After about a year, the motor gave out and stopped working. Other than that, it's a good unit...just don't expect to last for a long time."
1,Do Not Buy,"I got the Magic Bullet for Christmas. I tried it for making mousse and thought it was the greatest thing I had ever seen. Then I used it to chop onion - only problem is that the onion turned into gooey liquid, even using the tap method. The third time I tried to use it, the motor would not spin. It was totally broken after two uses, and I was careful not to let the motor run for more than a few seconds at a time. The idea is fantastic, but the product is lacking."
5,Magic Bullet hits the mark!,"We purchased the Magic Bullet for a very specific task ...to mix nutritional supplements into healthy juices and smoothies; and for this task it's performed perfectly. Some of the supplements in our health regime don't mix easily but the Magic Bullet works great. Our household of four gets it's start in the morning with with individualized servings of blended drinks. Because the Magic Bullet allows the beverage to be blended in the mug used for drinking, it enables us to get our day started quickly and with ease. Clean up is also quick and easy. We've used other quality blenders of the 40+ ounce variety, but this is the first blender we've used that allows us to do a very quick blended smoothie/icee/drink in a 16 oz. mug. We use our Magic Bullet at least 10 times a day and I can't imagine getting along without it."
1,Bite the Bullet,"That's what I had to do - Bite the Bullet after I Bought the Bullet. I spent $150 on this infomercial piece of junk. It was difficult to use. The first time I used it, it started smoking. After about two more uses, the motor decided to stay running - it would only stay off if it was unplugged. Additionally, the cups would not come off the bullet without much force and meanwhile it leaked everywhere. Now that I want a refund - I am shorted $50 in shipping fees to send everything back! What a waste of money. I'll tell everyone I know about the inconvenience and hope they don't Bite the Bullet."
1,DISSAPPOINTED!!!!!,I tried this product and was totally dissappointed! It did ot chop food-it pulverized it even when you pulsed it quickly like the instructions said! I tried chopping ice and it resulted in packed snow with some of the ice still in large cubes. I'll go back to my Braun stick blender ($20) that has some attachments for smoothies and chopping!
2,"Good when it is not broken,","The pastic ""thing"" that is on top of the main motor. This is the part that actually drives the blender ""thingy"" broke after a while. So the whole thing is pretty much useless. There is no replacement for it. So now I don't know what to do with all that plastic cup and containers that came with it..if the motor base itself does not work. REMEMBER: There are no spare parts that are sold seperately.This is certainly a good idea, unfortunately it is not very well made to last. For instance, the bearings holding the blades go bad after a few uses and they wobble making irratic contacts with the driver shaft of the motor. I think this causes everything to break."
1,Great Idea Terrible Experience,"The idea behind the Bullet is a great idea - small, easy to use and clean, includes ""to go"" cups with lids for finished product for traveling. However, my experience with using it was awful. If I didn't tighten the blade base to the cup really well (to the point of almost stripping the screw-in ridges), it would leak because if I didn't hold it just right to pulse, it locks; when trying to unlock, I invariably would loosen the blade base and juice would start leaking out. Eventually after only about a year's use (and not much at that), pulsing would not work well, and the motor would keep running past lifting my hand, or not pulse at all until it locks and eventually started stripping pieces of plastic off of the bottom of the cup that connects to the motor. In my book this gadget is a waste of $60. Don't be fooled by all those great commercials about it!"
1,"crappy quality, does not work as promised","I bought this after seeing it countless times on TV. We have two small children and my wife thought it would be easier to use than a larger food processor.After about two weeks the plastic o-ring broke, as many others have stated as well. Have not called in yet, but they are apparently about $10 for 4.It is also not very useful for chopping. All the stuff has to be pre-cut to even fit into the small cups or you use cocktail tomatoes and pearl onions, like they do on the show. This should have been a hint.Try to put a couple quarter onions in the cup and chop it and it will be very inconsistent with the stuff in the bottom being a mush and the larger pieces stick to the top and sides.I bought a small food processor (Black & Decker) at Wal-Mart for less than $15 and it works much better for chopping onions and veggies."
1,"Cheaply made, breaks, poor customer service from Homeland Housewares","Not worth the money, works for a short time then the cheap plastic gears break. Pulverizes food and frozen drinks end up with big chunks of ice. I've had two of these, but WILL NOT BE BUYING ANOTHER!I'd never recommend this to anyone, even my worst enemies."
3,"Liquifies great, does not chop like in infomercial","I bought this and found that it does not chop onions the same as in the infomercials, even when pulsing correctly. I found it liquifies onions while leaving some parts of onions in strips. As another review said, it is great for making smoothes and sauces. Also, a part of the base broke and there is not a replacement part and I do not want to shell out the money again for the base."
3,Not very durable,"I fount it not very durable and efficient. First, it breaks easily; Second, too many unuseful pieces; Third, hard to clean. It is not worth the money."
2,Customer Service Poor,The same thing happened to me that I have read about here. The small device inside broke. I called customer service and the steps they wanted me to go through were so tedious I can't print them all here. They were anything but helpful. We are on our 3rd machine in 5 years. I am going to return the one I just bought. Any ideas for another grinder that has good customer service?
1,Magic Nothing,"OK, we just wanted a small appliance to mix drinks at our bar. I guess it does that OK, BUT I can do that by hand. Just for the heck of it, I tried to use it to chop up FIVE mushroom stems (I needed to mix them with breadcrumbs to make stuffed mushrooms). NO CAN DO. No amount of shaking did it. The stems on the bottom stayed there and chopped while the others just sat there untouched. I tried both blades and different size canisters. Same NOTHING.What a joke. It's going back!"
2,Don't believe the commercial,I got this for Christmas last year. Its ok. I rarley use it. Its ok for making smoothies and things. Its horriable at chopping though. It just turns it into gross liquid. If your really into smoothies I would say buy but if not skip it.
3,Still working!,"I have wanted a Magic Bullet for so long, so when I finally received it I was super excited! It does work but I definitely do not use it daily like I thought I would. It's great for omelets, but smoothies usually don't get crushed all the way. I also use it for salsa which it does great with but with the price and how often I use it, I probably would of just continued using my large blender."
2,magic bullet express review,Only AVERAGE at best....I have to reblend the items that the Bullet cannot handle in my Kitchenaide blender.
1,I rate it a Negative Five (-5),"Please save your money and don't buy this product. After purchasing the bullet express, it broke and my wife went through the hassle to get the replacement part. The replacement broke also. Next, my wife again went through the hassle of having a replacement product sent. Believe it or not but that broke also. It has been over a year now. My next step is BBB.Save yourself the time, money, and frustration."
1,Poor Construction,"All in all, I've loved the bullet for smoothies, whipped cream, grinding spices, cheese and coffee. I was never able to use the ""pulse"" method to chop anything. Everything I tried to ""chop"" (salsa, onions) ended up liquified.What finally killed it was the gear drive broke, and it is made of plastic. You can't get a replacement-all you can do is order another power base at 30 bucks plus shipping. So far, it's not worth it to me."
3,Weak Motor,"The concept is great but the engineering is poor. The motor is the weakest link. It is slow and weak. Even the user's manual warns your not to run it continuously for more than 60 seconds. There are usually chunks of fruit or ice after multiple runs. If you use it regularly, don't expect it to last."
2,The product is not as advertised.,"The magic bullet has a lot of functional flaws. Well, first of all, when I called to buy the product, customer service tried to push a whole lot more expensive ""additional"" parts on me. For juice, this thing is pretty useless. You MIGHT be able to make juice from it's blender/filter combination. Juicing only works on very soft fruits (orange, canned pinapple). I tried make carrot apple juice and it all when to the garbage. In the infomercial, they make everything seem so easy. You will not be able to get results any close to what they've done. The bullet just liquifies everything. There's no magic in this bullet."
1,No Magic in the Bullet,"Piece of garbage. Died after 3 months. I did not even try to fix it, since it does not do the ""AS Seen in TV"" anyway. The guy who wrote long review and gave it 5 stars must be an insider. A representative of the company."
2,"Great idea, marginal quality","I bought this item for my daughter and was thrilled how much she used it to make terrific, healthy smoothies. But after 5 months, the motor died. I decided to buy a replacement because my daughter enjoyed it so much, and the new one doesn't even turn the blades. Great idea, but they need to work on the quality and durability."
1,This thing is awful,"It is cheap and plastic and doesn't do half the things it says it will. Definitely does not chop ice, so why it comes with drink mugs for frozen drinks is beyond me. It also takes forever to chop cheese, and pulverizes onions after one second, rendering them unusable in any recipe. Also, the plastic breaks easily. I ended up throwing mine out about a year after I got it. Piece of cheap junk."
2,BIG DISSAPOINTMENT!,"I SAW THE IMFORMERCIAL ON TV AND JUST HAD TO HAVE IT. IT TOTALLY PULVERIZES EVERYTHING, JUST MAKING MUSH. THE ONLY THING I LIKE IT FOR IS MAKING DOG FOOD FOR MY 2 TOY DOGS."
2,Don't bother with the Magic Bullet,"When I got this as a gift I was so excited because the infomercial makes it look like it can do anything, but it truely is false advertising. All it does it liquify everything. I've found the only thing it actually does very well is make smoothies. But don't count on crushing too much ice in it! It can only handle about 2 cubes at a time. It comes with a recipe book (also useless). I tried to make the salsa in it and in the end it had turned into spicy tomato puree. Yuck. At least it's pretty easy to clean and the cups are the perfect size for my breakfast smoothies. If that's all you're looking for it to do, then the Magic Bullet is perfect for you. Overall though, I'd say this thing is disappointing."
1,Save your money,I got my not-so-magic bullet on another web site. First problem is that it is almost all plastic. Second if you don't buy it from the manufacture there is no warranty. My magic slug stripped a gear after less than 6 weeks. No warranty the seller would not honor the warranty so I had to trash it. I am much happier with my Magic chef imersion blender and oster behive blender. Save your money buy a real blender. Wish I could use some nice Expletives to tell you of its quality but this is a PG rated site.
4,STAYS ON MY COUNTER,"One of the few items I leave on my countertop at all times.I use my MB mostly for blending eggs, sauces, etc. I have yet to master how to chop or dice onions with it. I seem to end up with mush or pureed onions.It is great for making smoothies, coffee coolatta's and salsa's.There are only 2 of us so making egg omelates in it is great. I received the large blender (aka juicer) with my machine and I have used that inplace of the smaller cup for larger amounts of ingredients. Can't say I like the juicer for juicing. Didn't work well at all.For better mixing, stop and shake between pulsing.Bottom line is if it broke on me, I would buy it again. Just wish I could master the dicing technique."
2,Save your money!,"We burned through 2 Magic Bullets in a fairly short amount of time. Now I'm left with all the cups, blender attachment, juicer attachment, etc. After learning that most blenders work with either a standard or wide mouth mason jar depending upon brand, why not just buy a case of mason jars at your local grocer or retailer and attach that to your blender? If you want mugs Ball makes Mason Mugs, they're only $8-10 a dozen. You can even try your Mayo jar! All you do is fill the mason jar with ingredients, attach the bottom of the blender to the mason jar, and set it on your blender base and turn it on. Basically the Magic Bullet is a blade, a motor, and a small jar. You can get that in a blender for less money. The juicer function is worthless, and it doesn't come with this set anyway. I could have saved myself a ton of money if I had just purchased the mason jars. Lesson learned."
2,Do _NOT_ put ice cubes in it!,"I bought one of these for my girlfriend a couple weeks ago. I read some of the reviews here about ice cubes breaking the machine and warned my girlfriend not to use it for that. She pointed out the infomercial and assured me it would handle ice ""As Seen on TV"". She made just one drink with it, the second time she used it she threw some (3) ice cubes in and it was instantly toast.We spent ~$70 (with shipping) and got one use out of it."
2,"Buy Two, there are no replacement parts!","I've had my Bullet for about a year and a half--just long enough to be out of warranty. As a Blender it's great. As a chopper/food processor it has issues. If I want chunky chicken salad, I use something else. With light use, (no one but me using it maybe twice a month) the plastic gear that runs in the base--and turns all the blades broke in two. It's a cheaply made, small piece that should be easily replaceable for under $10.00. I just got off of the phone with Customer Service and there are no replacement parts. You can buy a whole new base--for $40.00 plus shipping and taxes if you are out of warranty. Bottom line is that the Magic Bullet's ""magic"" is a design flaw that will break and you get to buy a new one every year or so--unless you are one of those lucky people who got a 4 yr warranty by purchasing two."
3,Good for making individual drinks...terrible chopper,"This is easy and fun for making individual smoothies, iced coffees and other mixed drinks. Be prepared to shake it quite a bit while it's running though. Good coffee bean grinder. And if you want to puree, it does well. I was hoping however it would replace my big food processor for chopping and it doesn't do that well at all. Purees what's on bottom and leaves what's on top alone. I keep using mine, but don't recommend it to others when they ask about it--I'm sure there are better products out there."
1,"Very noisy, agitating and it will give you a headache","Very noisy, agitating and it will give you a headache. Particularly in the morning if you trying to grind some coffee. The motor is very noisy no matter what you try to do to dampen the noise. I can carry it in my hand off the counter and hold it between my both hands and it will transfer the noise to my head even faster. Do not buy it. If they can dampen the noise and by changing the motor with one that heats less and less noisy. Then it will be a good product."
1,This is junk,My son bought this for me. It lasted 2 months. It was absolute junk. Why they charge so much when there are better blenders to choose from is beyond me.I would have rated it 0 if there were that choice.You'll be sorry if you buy this.
5,great idea,"I love my magic bullet so much that I bought one for my sister. It's great for smoothies and mixed drinks, really crushes the ice down to a smooth consistency and in just a few seconds. If you drink protein shakes then this thing is really wonderful because of the easy clean up."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS !!!,"This is the worst product I have ever purchased. My mom watched it on TV and purchased one for her self and one for me. Paid $220 plus $44 in shipping. It is made very cheap. Very cheap plastic and design. For $100 a piece, you would expect it to be made well. It even shot out the outlet we plugged it in. We shipped it to them at our expense and paid close to $70 to ship it back to them to get $220 back. They received it in May and credited our credit card on only one and said the other one was never recived. After numerous call backs they finally gave us the credit back on the other blender. Horrible experience with the product and service.Bullet Express Meal Maker Trio Standard Mixer Food Processor and Juicer in one Amazing MachineDo not buy.....worst purchse and service ever!!"
4,All Mixed Up,"The Magic bullet is great for those who have an active lifestyle, yet have little time to prepare, use and clean a traditional sized blender. I have a very active lifestyle and by using the Magic Bullet I'm 3 minutes away from a delicious post workout recovery drink."
1,This should get minus stars,"Just like most of the other customers, the black bottom that connects to the main unit stripped away and will not turn the blade. This is the second time I've had to replace it. All I ever make was smoothies with it and it couldn't handle it.I might as well go buy a blender and toss the bullet.Oh...and getting a replacement part is like pulling teeth. Good Luck.Lowsy product and avoid it at all costs."
1,No customer service,"I bought this item locally and promptly lost the manual. I sent three e-mails to the manufactuer but never did receive a reply. I eventually found the manual but haven't as yet used the machine. Going by the number of people using the Internet to try to obtain manuals, I am not the first customer who hasn't been able to get a response from the company."
4,Sorry to say but Ninja's customer service is HORRIBLE,Sorry to say that Ninja's customer service is HORRIBLE. I've been trying to contact them and the only 800 number they give on website says you must have a Sprint wireless phone to use!!! I've written tons of emails just asking them to call and they keep telling me to call the 800 number! I had ordered a part and they sent the wrong one. I sent it back to exchange and never heardfrom them....it's been a month.
2,New user - disappointed,"I just purchased my MB and went home to make chocolate mousse for dessert. It never made anything, just liquid. I tried a minute (not supposed to run longer) and nothing, I tried shorter, nothing.Then I moved on to sorbet with frozen fruit - took FOREVER and still not totally smooth although it was tastyFinally tried to make a margarita (needed it by then) and even with adding some liquid it never got smooth."
3,The machine is average..the infomercial is great!!,"I must say that this is my second Magic Bullet because the 1st one broke after a year. I just bought another one and ground buffulo meat that made a dee-lish burger. That being said, the best thing about this machine is the infomercial..the characters are great! especially the grumpy guy named ""vermon""(?). ""yuck i HATE Broccoli "" he exclaims as the trustworthy and annoying Aussie host says he can enjoy the juice without the ""yucky vegetable taste"" ..It's funny stuff..all the characters, including the hosts seem mildy retarded. The funniest thing is that they claim you can ""cook"" with it. So it's an OK machine (very difficult to puree almost anything) but the infomercial is tops!"
1,carolina from oregon,Worst thing I ever bought. It stopped after 4 uses. I sent it back. I had it 2 days. I would not buy ever again.
5,good product ans seller,"This was my first purchase from Amazon, and I was not disappointed, the item arrived in two days, this was with free shipping. The Silver Bullet was as it should be, just as the seller stated. I would not hesitate to order from them again"
4,Cheap magic bullet,"I went to Macys and saw it for $60 without the blender or the 4 cups. I ordered my from HSN for $60 and got the 4 cups, blender and all the accessories....."
5,"Personal, Versatile, Countertop Magician","If you seen the infomercials, they are cheesy and cheaply-made. But they sure hooked us! For the most part, our customer service was nice-they shipped it to us very quickly and were nice and helpful. When the thing came, we were so I excited, I decided to make salsa. As you will hear many reviews say, it turned into mush. That was because I didn't listen to the directions-make sure you read and follow ALL of them! You have to get the hang of the ""Pulse"" technique, and then it works fine. It is a good little machine, and I would recommend it highly! Just listen to what the directions say, and you will be very satisfied."
1,Disppointed,When I received the Magic Bullet Express I was excited to use it. But I learned that the machine was broken when I received it. It did not run properly. So I had to send it back. I'm still waiting 3 weeks later.
1,SHORT LIFE!!,"We've enjoyed our Magic Bullet blender for slightly under three years. Then (suddenly?) the drive gear on the motor base wore away. You'd think the little rubber nubbies on the bottom of the cutter assembly would wear, and they probably did, but the hard plastic vanes of the driver piece just shredded.Could this have been because of mis-use, like maybe not pushing down hard enough to assure full engagement of the nubbies in the vanes? I don't know; I'm not going to tell my wife and daughter that they didn't know how to operate a simple hand blender. This thing has to live in the real world.Now the thing is junk. I'll start looking for repair parts, but it sounds like I'm out of luck. I wouldn't recommend the Magic Bullet, until they change their material choice."
2,I only grind grains and beans with it!,"Well, when we first purchased this, we tried to send it back. It didn't do anything that even the commercials SHOWED it doing! You have to take the cup part out of the base and shake it to redistribute the contents. I can't even puree baked vegetables in it very well! HOWEVER, it does a fantastic job powdering grains and beans for my son's super porridge. BUT--NOT in large quantities! You have to use the little cup. It won't puree baby food very well, doesn't puree ripe fruit, won't chop anything (it just puree's what's near the blade and doesn't pull food down from the top of the cup so it remains whole), and you have to add a LOT of water to get it to make smoothies or, well, anything else for the matter. NOT worth your money unless you are specifically making super porridge (it DOES NOT grind coffee beans very well because of the oil--JUST DRY GRAINS AND BEANS)."
2,pulverizes onions,"I tried to chop onions with it (seemed simple enough). The Bullet liquified the onions that were are the bottom and never touched the onion pieces at the top. I tapped it and shook it, but it never did anything to the onions on top. I even scooped out some of it. More of a hassle than help."
4,Magic Bullet #3,"We've purchased three of these magic bullets, one as a gift to our daughter. Aside from its convenience, what my wife loves is its ease of cleaning. We threw away our coffee bean grinder and now use the magic bullet instead. The first two we bought were with the weaker motor so, according to the manufacturer's directions, we are careful to run it only in 30 sec. bursts. For our purposes that's fine. It also makes a quick and convenient margarita mixer for individual portions. We haven't begun to take advantage of what seem to be endless uses."
5,Best invention since the microwave,"I love this product and use it daily. I am a 26 year old, mother of a 3 and a 2 year old and I love the magic bullet. It was perfect for chopping up food that my kids ate as their first real food. Spaghetti takes forever to cut up with a fork, just stick it in the magic bullet with a little extra sauce and it blends up perfectly for a 7month old. The flat blade is perfect for shipping up raw eggs to make an omelet, or cream to make mousse. My only complaint is the cord. I wish it would wind up into the product. It really is one of those products that I keep on my counter. Ice= pulverized, hard cheese= crumbled, nuts= chopped.I make cake balls and it works like a dream to crumble up the cake. It works just like they say and is truly my favorite product. Ive had mine for 3 years now and it still hasn't broken down, when it does I will buy another. I have actually bought them for Christmas gifts, twice, and both times I wanted to keep them."
2,Rotor broke after ~50 uses or so,It really does the job. If it is not broken. The rotor was permanently stuck while making a smoothie. And it is not something which you could easily replace. Great disappointment. I would not recommend it. Search for an alternative with more durable electronics.
3,Mediocre product (at best),"We've had this product for several years now, but it has only been used sporadically. The components just did not seem to be made of quality. After some use, the motor wouldn't shut off so we had to unplug the unit after every single use. Then the motor burned out - and I mean burned out (strong burn odor when used). In the trash it goes.Probably got close to our money's worth out of it, but honestly I will never purchase an Infomercial product again."
3,Magic bullet,"So far, so good. I just make sure I don't run it for more than 10 seconds at a time. Been using soft fruits only and when I used carrots, had bigger bits of it floating around. Easy to clean. The tedious part is cutting up the fruits."
5,AMAZING,AMAZING the first word in caps says it alli got this to be used in India and it delivered what it promisedmake fresh V8 juices ginger garlic paste and all in minutesin one word BELISIO
4,VERY HAPPY,One of my workmates recommended the Silver Bullet so I purchased in hopes that my teenage boys might make themselves some healthy smoothies. We all love it. Am looking forward to trying some of the recipes like homemade salsa.
2,doesn't last,"I have had my Magic Bullet for a year, using it almost exclusively for mixed drinks. Others are right - forget about using it for onions or garlic or peppers, it chops them too finely, into mush. The pulse action quit working, and I had to toss it. The cup actually became lodged in the motor unit and I had a hard time getting it out. Have finally bought a Tribest, I'll see how that one is."
4,Loving it!,"My husband and I make smoothies all the time for breakfast. The taste great, and are extremely well blended. Of course the product does not work like the commerical, but common sense told us that us. We still love it!"
4,"good, but fragile","It's great to quickly grind up and store adult food for a baby all in one unit. It does smell though if you hold it down too long, but we learned quickly not to do that. My trouble was that food got stuck so I tapped it against the countertop to loosen it up and two of the four tiny clear plastic pieces broke that are what get the motor to turn on when the cup is pressed into place. It's best used to grind up liquidy stuff."
3,A BIT DISAPPOINTING,"When I recieved my Magic Bullet, I was more than thrilled to start using it right away. When I started to ""blend"" my ingredients, the bullet did nothing more than swirl around the ingredients. But after awhile, and a little tapping here and there, it began to work a bit better.My Other concern was that when I just wanted to pulse the bullet, it would get stuck and continue to ""blend"" long after I wanted to end the pulse.Besides the two above complaints, the Magic is not half bad. It mixes ok, but I wouldn't pay $60 for it."
3,Not like the TV shows,This is great for anything liquid that you want to mix. It didn't shred cheese at all. I have a 7 month old who gets terrified when I turn it on because it is so loud. Nice for some things but I wouldn't have bought it if I would have tried it first.
1,Watch for deceptive use of number of pieces,"I just got my order from another online vendor that bizrate called a ""Best Buy"". They offered 19, not the usual 17 pieces for about the same price as everyone else. Guess what the extra pieces are? Another cookbook and a set of four extra rubber ring seals that they failed to ship. (They are also out of stock on those little gems and offer a $7.00 credit to keep the shipment ""As Is"") Suggestion -- unless the additional pieces specifically include the blender attachment, beware."
5,Magic Bullet Success,"I am thoroughly enjoying our magic bullet! We have frozen drinks and shakes instantly with little cleanup. Whipping cream is VERY easy and so much better than the aerosol cans; ditto fresh salsa.There is a learning curve for 'chopping' without pureeing, but this is practice with the technique. I just ordered another for a gift!"
1,Do Not Buy,I bought the Magic Bullet hoping it would last at least a year - I've barely had it 6 months. It has broken down twice and I finally tossed it in the trash. The problem is that the unit overheats and melts the plastic rotating unit stuck. This has happend with my Magic Bullet as well as my mom's Magic Bullet. I would not suggest purchasing this blender.
2,For want of a $0.10 part the blender is lost,The plastic drive wheel in the base of my MB blender broke in two. From what I've read this is a major problem with the machine. A replacement part is not availabe rendering the blender and all its attachments useless. Poor product support
1,Never Ever buy one of theses!!!!!,"We just purchased a Magic Bullet from Amazon.com. It would be a nifty product to have, EXCEPT, ours arrived defective. There is a crack in the disk covering the motor compartment which will allow liquids to leak in and eventually cause the motor to fail. I wrote to the company that makes them, and they told me there is nothing I can do to activate the warranty because I am not the original owner! Huh!!?? I just got the thing....But, I purchased from Amazon, not Homeland Housewares!!!Who buys from Homeland Housewares????? Never heard of them! But they are the owner company. So they have found a loophole so they don't have to honor warranties on this product. On a positive note, Amazon has agreed to take it back and give us a refund for it, which I am doing."
1,Don't waste your money.,"Don't waste your money. It couldn't crush ice for a smoothie, it couldn't mince ham that had already been diced into quarter-inch pieces, and when I tried to make egg saled the boiled eggs got all jammed up everywhere. And yes, I RTFM. Hopefully I'll be able to pass this along to some sucker in a garage sale."
2,Selling it at next garage sale,"I had high hopes for this product, but I am disappointed. When trying to use the magic bullet to blend, chop, etc., most of the food ends up in the upper part of the cup and only the lower inch gets blended, chopped, etc. I have to shake it numerous times to mix it and knock the food down lower to get it next to the blades and after about 10 minutes of struggling with it, I might as well have just got out the chopping board! I even tried something more liquid-like (chocolate mousse) and again it just wouldn't mix well...had to shake it and take the top off and stir it. I've read and followed the instructions and used the right amt of ingredients. They make it look so handy and easy on T.V.! It's just taking up space under the counter right now, so it will be heading out to the next spring garage sale."
1,"Broke in 3 months, no warranty","I purchased Magic Bullet to make baby foods. It was working fine until I used it for 3 months. The motor died and that was it. There is no warranty and they wouldn't replace it.By the way, if you want to make pesto like they do in the commercial, this blender won't grind hard cheese and pine nuts. If you like liquid salsa, this one works, but there won't be any chunks. I ended up chopping tomatoes with knife.This was a total waste of money. For the same amount of money, you can buy a Cuisinart that does similar things and they have 3 year warranty. Go for a trusted brand!!"
3,"Great for some things, poor for others. Overall, okay - BUT!","It's overpriced. For what you get, it should be around $40. Buy on ebay. Don't pay full price.It's really impressive for things that are hard to prepare in a conventional blender, such as whipping up mousse in seconds. I use it to prepare light butter with herbs, ice cream, chopping nuts and lots of other things.But it's not good for heavy-duty blending and large quantities. Good for a single person or small items.Juicer sucks.I don't care for the plastic cocktail cups. Who serves nice cocktails in children's plastic cups?Problem: I blended heavy cream with frozen fruits, and the plastic piece that spins the blade broke. This made the whole thing utterly unusable. Apparently it isn't all that strong."
2,Broke twice in first five uses,"I got the magic bullet as a gift and was excited by the results of the first few times I used it. The third time I used it the silicon seal in the blade base got caught up in the blade, I switched to the other blade and used it twice before the same thing happend. When I called the company to ask for some replacement seals they told me they didn't sell through amazon.com and wouldn't warranty the product unless I bought it from them. So if you do decide to buy, don't buy it here...apparently the company doesn't know about Amazon! Ha!"
4,Great product,"Got a great deal on Amazon for this. It is excellent. If people complain about the motor breaking too soon, it is because they don't know how to use it properly. If you don't use the pulsing technique they explain to you in the manual and the infomercial, you will blow the motor out. Learn how to use it before doing anything, and you will be totally satisfied with an awesome product. This thing can do almost anything!!!"
4,What's this for?,"Found a circular black rubber thing in the bottom of the box when I opened my new Magic Bullet. Look like I would need it to do something. I cleaned everything up, and tried to make a drink, lots of noise no mixing. The circular black rubber thing was the drive for the mixer blade. All OK now, good drink, good Bullet. Maybe the bullet people should have a final check before the unit is packed for distribution to a customer. I must say thanks for putting the black rubber thing in the box, I surly would have much more aggravated had it not been there."
1,disappointed,I saw a commercial and was totally sold on this. My friends bought it as a present and I tried it out. I tried to chop up some seafood for a salad. Some of the shrimp because almost mush and the rest was still chunky. Gross.... Same for other items.... Disappointed.
1,Don't waste your money!,"I have the 110 volt plug in Bullet, the rechargeable bullet, and a Bella 110 volt plug in Blender. We use our blender(s) nearly every day. Without a question, the Bella outperforms the Bullets many times over. The rechargeable bullet is frankly ""WORTHLESS""! To many downs to even worth mentioning. Just a plain waste of money. The 110volt Bullet is barely useful. The RPM's on the motor are to low and it takes for ever to mix a blended drink with ice cubes. The top of the motor and switches gum up very easily with just a little leakage from the mixer, and there is no easy way to clean or lubricate them. The Bella makes short work of ice cubes with a very high rpm motor/blade combo. The funny thing is that if you watch the sale ads, the Bella Frequently sells at major stores for aroung $24 to $30. Hope this was helpful."
4,Very handy blender,"I've had it for less than a month and I have to say that this is one of the most convenient blenders and certainly the easiest to clean. I have limited counter-space and this hardly takes up that much room... and has been perfect for whipping up baby food, shakes and sauces. It's been great for making small portions and it has worked well so far.The only concern that I would note about the product and that is the safety feature (or lack thereof). My husband washed the blade and stored it on top of the motor base -- which is a big no-no because if you accidentally press down on it and triggered the motor, you could lose your fingers. I think something as simple as an on-off switch would be helpful. Anyways, I try to unplug it whenever it's not being used."
2,A little difficult...,"This product has one major flaw. Everything is meant to be blended in 10 seconds or less. The unit overheats after one minute. This means that you can't use it after one minute because it automatically shuts down. It says that you can just put in whole items likes fruits etc, but in reality you have to chop them up because you will go over your time limit. It also does not chop up ice very effectively for making smoothies and starts to overheat quickly. I was a little disappointed given the price and all the good reviews."
1,It will only chop your money . . .,Please take my advice and do NOT buy the magic bullet. I purchased this as a gift for my partner. It was used only to make soy and juice drinks a few days a week. Within three months it simply stopped working. The maker DOES NOT stand behind the product and DOES NOT honor their warranty.The only thing that the Magic Bullet chops or blends into liquid is your money.Buy a blender or food processor from a reputable brand company that has a track record of honorable customer service.
1,AVOID!,"We've had two of these now and they have both broken and customer support has been unresponsive. The first one I bought was through an online auction site. When this one broke in about 6 months (of admittedly heavy use), Magic Bullet claimed my blender was a knock off and refused to provide service. So, I went to the store and bought another one thinking that I had been duped by an online auctioneer (even though the packaging and contents of the auction version and store bought versions were EXACTLY the same).So, now about 10 months of having this one and actually very light use, the EXACT SAME PART broke. So, thinking I was still under warrantee I called MB again for service and they were again unhelpful. Don't buy it."
1,Don't buy it,I purchased last year for christmas. It stopped working in late November.I wasn't able to contact them until after the holidays on December 26th. Because it was shipped on Dec 20th they would not honor the warranty because I was 6 days over the year. The item was a christmas present so not opened until then. IT ONLY WORKS 10 MONTHS. CUSTOMER SERVICE TERRIBLE. THEY DO NOT BACK THIS PRODUCT
2,Not a durable product,"I bought the Magic bullet because I like the compact size which is perfect for preparing baby food. It functioned greatly in the initial use. However, after only a few times, the base broke down and I have to send for replacement under the limited 1 yr warranty. Their customer service was not that responsive in returning emails. I did not try to call them as I bought a KidCo Food Mill later."
2,Inferior quality construction materials,"I bought one of this less than six months ago, it recently started to leak, when I checked I found it cracked at the root of the blades???? despite I have not done half of the things they advertised on TV, any one with some experience with tools will realize that the blades are mounted in a very fragile base. The concept is good but not very well put into practice. I have not seen this from Osterizer, just to mention what quality is; my Grandma's blender is still working after 60 years!I would not recommend this product to anyone."
2,Irreplaceable plastic parts.,I was using the Magic Bullet sparingly until its main drive gear on top of it's base unit shattered into 3 main pieces. It's made of plastic and I have not been able to find any source of replacement parts. When I contacted the distributor they only offered to sell me a new unit. They advertise it like it can handle anything but the gear broke while I was mixing a regular protein shake.I can't recommend this product.
1,Great Start.....Poor Finish,"I am addicted to the that little powerhouse called the Magic Bullet. The problem is the company doesn't have a real customer service department and they don't stand behind their cheap product. We are on our 4th Bullet now!! They are great out of the starting gate...best ""blender, chopper, etc"" I have ever experienced. But it wasn't built to last!! We follow directions, love everything it makes, love the way it looks on the counter even. But it dies quickly and the company S**Ks at replacing or helping out. We only ordered the first one just over a year ago. Each one seems to last only a few months (about 3) then...Whammo..no warning, just dead!"
2,Its only OK...,"It works alright, as long as you make just drinks...which makes it about as good as any other blender on the market...and more expensive than most.Anything else it just tends to liquify, even using the ""pulse"" method they suggest.P.S. NEVER in the commercial to you see the host either scooping out chunks, disloging the blade, and not once did he have to stop and tap the ingredients(as you have to do every 5 seconds in reality)I waited a looong time to order one of these things and finally the 2 for 1 deal talked me into it(only to pushed by a salesman trying to sell additional merch) and to top it off I was hit w/ a 40 dollar shipping fee for 2 blenders. I KNOW it doesnt cost 40 bucks to ship to Jersey...."
1,Magic Bullet is a dud. Negative 5 stars.,"My girlfriend bought me a magic bullet for christmas. Its pure and simple junk. Just another promise of ease in the kitchen of which the machine couldnt back. I tried to make chicken salad in it and it could not chop chicken. I tried one of the party drinks listed, a bullet to the head, the bottom of the blade stripped as it could not even chop ice. The Magic bullet broke after 2 uses. I would say your better off buying a good blender. I strongly advise not to buy this product. Buyer beware. We are going to try and send back to get our money back. It looks good in the infomercial but it just does not live up to it's claims. Do not buy this product......This is possibly the biggest piece of junk selling on TV today... Never buy it... Danger. Warning its crap.."
1,I should have known better...,"I picked up a Magic Bullet at Bed Bath and Beyond as a Christmas gift for my fiancee. The day after Chrismas I decided to try it out. It's loud, annoying, and leaves chunks behind...sort of like a bad house guest. It's being returned."
1,"Great expectations, poor presentation","The only good thing I can say about this product besides the aggressive advertising effort, is that it has the perfect size cup for a single serve drink.As I was happily putting my protein drink together, I turned it over to start blending. All I heard was a whirring sound.When I removed the cup - I saw that the driver bit - the part the turns the blades around was all worn out and busted.All these cups and serving pitchers, and colored lids, and cups and all the accessories - was worth nothing.I cant recommend this product - it has a very limited life span. Less than a year if you use it 3-4x a week.Won't buy it again."
2,it breaks if you use ice cubes!,DO not use ice cubes in the Magic Bullet it will break.If you decide to make a smoothie crush the ice 1st or you will have a dead Magic Bullet in less then a year.I cannot find parts for mine and neither can all the other people sitting around with a broke device!
2,Great till it broke,"I loved this product while it worked. We followed the instructions. Made great party drinks, slushes, shakes. Used it to make some sauces, dips. The only problem, a major one, was that the black plastic gear on the base that pushes the gear on the cups, broke. Actually, it wore down until it wouldn't make contact with the gear on the cup. Had a trsditional blender for over 10 years and it's fine, this broke after 6 months of useage. If this hadn't broke would have given it 5 stars. SHould last longer."
1,Can I give ZERO stars?,"I wish I had read these postings before I bought a Bullet on impluse. I got mine at a local department store. I read and followed the directions. The very first time I used it, my husband said ""I hope you didn't spend much money on that. It won't be around long."" The high pitched whine was a dead give away. And he was right. After three weeks of daily use, the motor froze and the container is locked on. We are going to buy a Tribest based on the overwhelming number of FIVE star reviews it has."
2,DOESN'T WORK LIKE THE INFOMERCIAL! This one's going back tomorrow!,"This ""wizzy"" weak motor might do well with smoothies etc, but didn't make chicken salad like the infomercial -I am a gourmet cook and found it to be frustrating. Items in jar get stuck easily and are hard to get everything processd. Large chunks and also over process pieces in the same jar are the result.It's going back tomorrow.Don't waste your money!"
2,Quick and Easy,"The Magic Bullet is quick and easy. So far, clean up and use have both taken little time. There are chunks of fruit (when using fruit) left if not left blending for a little while. And sometimes, even after blending for a little, while, there are still a few chunks. Overall, it still is managable. I have not had it that long, so I do not have more information about its several uses, but thus far, making a shake is great. Slight electric smell when blending long, but I read somewhere it is okay (so I am not getting ready to burn the house down). Basically, fast cleanup, easy to use, quick changing parts, small to store, nice little blender (-:"
3,So-so on Magic Bullet,"I'm neutral on the Magic Bullet (MB). It's an OK product. It grinds coffee pretty well but no better than a cheap coffee grinder. It makes smoothies OK but if you add ice cubes to yours, like I do, expect to find chunks of ice remaining in the glass. MB is convenient for making single servings, leaving the mixing container as a drinking glass with very little to clean up. I have yet to be able to chop vegetables for salsa. My salsa attempts have resulted in soup-like pureed vegetables. The instructions state that the technique to chop vegetables takes practice so maybe I'm not yet an expert. MB tends to finely grind items at the bottom of the mixing container and not so much at the top, without thoroughly mixing all the contents during blending.Overall you won't be disappointed enough to return it unless you paid full retail price. We bought two for a reduced price and I ended up with the extra one as a gift."
2,leaks after only using a few times,This product is not made well. The seal on both blade rims came off which caused liquid to spray all over. Not worth the expense. Will go back to my old trustworthy blender.
3,"Love product, but hate the customer service","Received the item as a gift and the cross blade unit was defective. I attempted to have JUST THAT PIECE REPLACED, per their written warranty, BUT, even though they could confirm it was indeed their product from the UPC code, they would not honor the replacement because it was not purchased from an ""authorized dealer.""Although I could PURCHASE said part for a mere 4.95 + 3.95 for shipping, I am choosing not to as customer service is far more important to me than a product that I actually really like, but could find from another company. I find it very poor form that a company that has made millions would be perform so poorly on the customer service scale. On a side bar, it takes 2 -3 days to hear back from them via email on every single transaction. There is no easy way to deal with The Magic Bullet."
4,WoW,"I recommend this product for anyones who wants to cut down on time needed to prepare and make after workout drinks, no mess and quick."
5,Magic Bullet Delivers!,"Great Product. If you are one of those people that hates schlepping out a food processor or a blender in order to cook something, this is for you. Takes up very little counter space, easy to clean, and works like a charm. Well worth the money."
2,"Really, just don't do it!! No, Really!","I love the concept and if it would last I'd definitely recommend it. But thats the problem, isn't it?Mine lasted almost 1 year of light use (2-3 times a month). The gears grinded up and there is powder everywhere.I liked it when it worked so I'd recommend another brand but don't have experience with others. Just don't get the ""Bullet Blender""."
3,Works well - while it works,"We've had this little thing for almost a year now and it works fairly well. We have had problems with the blender attachment wanting to come unscrewed while in operation. We've learned to watch that. We've also had one base fail completely. The manufacturer was very good about getting a new unit to us, but now that one is having issues as well."
4,AWESOME,"Bought it for my girlfriend for Xmas, she loves it and so do I. We mix our coffee in it every morning :)As far as the chopping and all that goes i can't say i use it much for that but when i have i get paste and liquidy stuff. But in all fairness I have zero food processor etc knowledge.The only con I honestly see is that all of my cups have split, hairline cracks that are like seams running the hieght of the mugs, i assume from being in the microwave here and there. It's also a bit loud but the neighbors can just deal, i often wonder if they think i'm getting tanked on margarittas at 9 am lol.The cups are cheap and you'll likely be replacing them after 6 months but they're so cheap on eBay it should not discourage your purchase. This is a good investment.I'd say it's more than capable of what's seen in the infomercials and it really had been advertised correctly."
3,Works Well,"I've had my MB for quite a few years now. It may not make the best smoothies but it does grind flax seed quite well. Unfortunately, instead of testing it out I bought a Krups 203-42 Fast Touch Coffee Grinder for my flax tasks; it is a great little machine but I'm taking back b/c my MB does a GREAT job!"
1,One star is too many!!!,"Do not purchase any product from this seller. I ordered the magic bullet via echeck. i cancelled my order and was promised my money returned to my bank account the same day it was taken out. It has now been 21 days since they took my money. to date i have no product and my money is gone. i have contacted these people 4 times and each time i got a different answer. the first time they told me my money would be automatically redeposited in my account the same day. the next time they told me 5-10 days. the time after that they told me it could take up to 15 business days. the time after that they told me they would get it back to me as soon as possible by ""putting a rush on it"". it has now been 21`business days and still nothing. they promise to call me back and never do. they refuse to let me speak to someone in charge. this product is not worth the hassel of doing business with such a poor excuse for a company."
1,worst product I have ever seen...Its a big failure,"I can definitely suggest people, never ever try to buy a stupid product as this, frankly its just waste of money....You can as well go to some other store and get much better blenders for much lower prices.They advertise it saying that it works for anything, but it will not even work for onions, use it first time, and it gets spoiled. You will have a 1 year warranty, but they keep charging you for every replacement. Intially paying for the product is a waste, and getting charged everytime (knowing that it will be spoiled again) is another big waste. It just occupies some valuable space in your kitchen."
1,What a piece of garbage...,"We purchased our magic bullet only 2 months ago and it's already bricked!! Even though we only used it to chop up the simplest of things! We followed the instructions in the manual to a T. A protein shake every other morning, an omelette or two, weekly salsa. My same-sex partner and I also like to make our own homemade cat food. Usually a mixture of salmon filet and chicken bones. Where most food processors would turn the salmon and bones into a fine ""moist"" powder, this device just made loud clunky noises and a shard-filled fish paste. One time we tried to chop up some aquarium gravel and it BUSTED THE FRIGGIN MIXING CUP!!!!!! What a #&@$% of shit! Unless you're planning on using it solely to dice up some old cheese, fuh-get about it!"
1,Forewarned in time,"Like one of the other reviewers, my thanks to all who reviewed this ""Magic Bullet"" I was going to buy one for my wife as they are reasonably priced on Amazon, but after reading all the reviews I have changed my mind. It would appear that it is of value for smoothie drinks, but worthless for just about anything else, foregoing the inflated claims on the infomercial. Like most items advertised on infomercials - primarily junk!Thanks for saving me money and frustration."
1,Product never received thanks to UPS,Never received this product thanks to UPS's incompetence. They claimed it was delivered to my door step yet nothing ever showed up. Amazon.com gave me a refund.
4,Great product because cleanup is easy!,"This product works great for what I use it for, making smoothies, which can be done in about a minute which includes cleanup time. Any blender can make a smoothies but what I like about the magic bullet is the lack of clean up. I make the smoothies in the cup I'll be drinking out of and then only have to rinse off the blade under water that's it, no mess, no other cleanup.I'm planning on making salsa with this as well. The only think I'll complain about is it's ability to crush ice, my icecube tray makes giant ice cubes and the magic bullet doesn't fully crushed them as well as I would like but I think it's more about the size of the ice than anything else, I plan on getting a smaller ice cube try. But making smoothies with frozen fruit has allowed me to skip the ice all together! Great product!"
2,"Blends well, but pricey and questionable quality","My wife purchased this from a local retailer on sale. This blender does blend shakes well. But the blade attachment leaks into the blender base, so I am not sure how long this will last. In addition, one of the plastic bumbers in the blender base has come loose. I've only used this product for 1 week and I've already run into these problems. In addition, you can only blend smaller quantities with the bullet. Save your money and get a conventional blender that will last for years."
2,Malfunctioned almost immediately,"I hate to add to negative reviews, but I must. The Magic Bullet was awesome while it worked, which was maybe two weeks, then it started to smoke every time and the spinning segment inside the base was burning away the gray plastic liner. Then it refused to spin.I am going to return it as defective rather then waste my time trying to get a new one. Two stars because when it worked, it was a pretty clever gadget."
4,Still worth the money,"My previous unit finally broke at the gear in the center like everybody else after almost 2 years of usage. I use it daily to make my morning shakes so I feel I got my use out of it. It is far more convenient than using a blender and if I get another 2 years out of the new one I bought, I will probably keep on buying one. I only gave it 4 stars because I do not understand a company that does not improve a critical flaw in a product they sell that is both excellent and popular.One comment I would like to make for users of this product. I noticed shorter people(women, children) tend to not push the blender down evenly when they use this but instead tend to push it more toward themselves. This will tend to put more pressure on the cup's nubs near you, sometimes breaking them. I am guessing this may also put more pressure on the center gear that tends to break for most of the users."
5,handy personal blender,"I originally purchased this product for my mother who has trouble eating apples (her favorite fruit) because of her dentures. I had not ever seen the informercial but have heard her comment about how easy and effortless it was to make apple sauce and smoothies.Yes, this is a very handy and lightweight personal blender. I have a powerful Cuisineart blender but it has been awhile since I used it because of its bulkiness and heaviness.I've made several fresh fruit juices with this Magic Bullet Express. It is a breeze to clean and handle, unlike the Cuisinart. I have read that other customers mentioning that the motor conks out after 1 year of constant use. Hopefully, the company will be able to improve the longevity of the motor. I will definitely keep using the Magic Bullet because it is so compact and easy to use."
4,"So far, so good","I just received my Magic Bullet the other day and am quite pleased so far. I am a protein shake drinker and was having to mix my drinks by hand (a large blender didn't seem to suit my needs for one drink in the mornings). I have used this blender only for smoothies and shakes so far, but I do have to say it is a great product. It honestly takes 3 pulses to blend my shakes in the mornings and the thing I like about this product is the individual size cups that screw directly into the unit.I have not used this product for dicing, chopping, etc. so I cannot comment on that. I usually do all that by hand and have never used an appliance to do that kind of work.The instruction manual does point out NUMEROUS times not to run the appliance for over a minute as it may burn out the motor. Therefore, I rarely use it in the lock mode and only use the pulse option.I am pleased so far and think if you are looking for a blender for drinks, shakes, smoothies, this is it."
1,CONSUMER BEWARE! PRODUCT NOT LIKE IN INFOMERCIAL!,"This product marks the first and last time I will buy a product from an infomercial. The concept seems nice, but it cannot actually crush ice, chop onions, etc. I found this machine to be useful in making salsa, but put in anything harder than a tomato and the pathetic little machine fails. If you are considering buying one, just let me know and you can have mine!"
2,wheel on base broke,"Initially loved it. Was easy to use. After about a year the black wheel on the base broke (as I've read happened to other people). It shattered while making a shake. Would only buy again if I got a very good deal, knowing it would break again."
2,"Awesome Idea, breaks to easily","I used the bullet daily to make frozen cappuccino drinks and after three months of use the attachement that turns the motor broke into several pieces. If the attachment was made to withstand continual use the item would be given 5 stars. In short, excellent idea, needs to be built better!"
2,As good as the $29 walmart one,"Last year I bought a rivals product at walmart and returned it because the blade spins too slow (not like my $100 blender) so my smooth-e would not be so smooth. Returned it. This year, Costco had the magic bullet on sale so I got one. I am looking for a smooth-e machine so I do not have to mess with my big ol' blender. Well, it worked just like the $29 walmart one. The power motor just does not have the power and speed to really grind through ice or frozen fruit. It will eventually get the job done but blending time is in the minutes. This one will be returned as well and I will stick to my good ol' blender that will have a finished smooth-e in less than 30 seconds. I gave this a 2 star simply because I am sure it will be good for other things but definitely not for grinding ice with speed."
3,majic bullet,"good product for the price. cups are cheap plastic. If it slip from your hand and falls, it will break. If it is 3/4 full it will not blead unless you stop and shake it"
1,HORRIBLE MACHINE,"THIS PRODUCT IS THE WORST CHOPPER YOU WILL EVER BUY! DON'T BUY IT! THE BLADES ARE FLAT AND IT TAKES OVER 20 MINUTES TO CHOP SIMPLE FRUIT. I SENT THIS GARBAGE BACK AND PURCHASED ""POWER CHOPPER"". NOW THE POWER CHOPPER IS MY BEST FRIEND. IT CHOPS AND MAKES THE BEST SMOOTHIES! PLEASE DON'T BUY THE BULLIT, UNLESS YOU WANT TO BE FRUSTRATED!AMAZON IS THE GREATEST! THE HAVE THE BEST CUSTOMER SERVICE, AND THEY HELPED ME TO GET MY MONEY BACK FROM THE RETURN OF THIS NON-FUNCTIONAL PRODUCT."
1,It is junk I only wish there was a zero star rating,It failed after 1 month and the manufacturer would not honor the warranty because I did not buy it directly from them.
4,Bullet is the best,"This thing is the best. I would say I paid for it in about 2 weeks. No more coffee house or juice bar for me. I get veggies in my family without them knowing. My two sisters and my best friend have it and all rave about it. Honestly if you are one of the cranksters complaining about the Magic Bullet you likely are just cranky in general.I won't say it does everything like the infomercial but to say it doesn't crush ice well...that's just silly. They tell you to check the ""o"" ring regularly; they tell you not to run it over a minute at a time to avoid overheating. You likely have some culpability if you can't use a Magic Bullet.I will say the juicer attachment is worthless, do not waste the money to get this extra attachment."
5,I just love this thing!,"This thing is so cool. I picked up on impulse at costco and knew I was risking disappointment...wrong!I've had it a two weeks and used it more than I ever used my blender, mixer and food processor combined.When you are juggling four dishes in one meal and trying to get it all on the table at one time the most obvious plus is the multiple cups. Rinse off the blade and away you go. Once I used it five different ways in one dinner.It is certainly way cooler than my big old blender. Don't hate it because the infomercial is so obnoxious. Do read the manual and have realistic expections. Great gift for a college freshman..."
1,cheap cheap cheap,"the product is really cheap...burns out in months. then, you find out that customer service is terrible and there are no AFFORDABLE replacement parts."
2,My bullet kicked the bucket,"Not intended for every day use. Just as other reviewers here have mentioned - there are irreplaceable, movable, plastic parts that drive the blades. I got about 1 year of daily use out of my bullet before the plastic disc that spins the blades split into 3 pieces. I never used it to crush or blend anything very hard (no ice or compact solid foods - generally just bananas and soy milk). I tried to repair the disc with epoxy and got it back into one piece, but the threads that the disc screws onto had been rubbed bare. The threading was of course made of the same weak plastic - so no luck on that. I even tried to line the disc with glue so there'd be no need for the plastic threading. This fix was also not effective.Recently I got a Bella Cucina Rocket from Target - I will update if it proves to be a superior product."
2,Mine was a birthday present,"it was fun to make smoothies, I like that it is smaller and saved dirtying an extra glass compared to using a blender. But just by looking at it you can tell its cheaply made. Personally I think this unit should sell for under 20 dollars. It was only a matter of time before it bit the dust. Mine was bought at full price $59.99 at bed, bath, and beyond but apparently the warranty is no good and I can't get parts. Even though it says it has a warranty, it's a lie. The concept is good, I just wish that it was better made by a company that stood behind their product. I think there should be a class action law suit to refund all the units that failed under the stated warranty but were not replaced. In the mean time I will continue to use my Oster that has lasted me for years."
1,It broke in 6 months,I have used it for smoothies only and it stopped working after 6 months. I feel it is not not reliable and not worth spending money on it.
1,"No magic, just a pile of cheap plastic.","Terrible design!The gear connects to the cross blade is loose in the first day of using. The gear on the base that drives blades broke in the second day of using.Can't understand why they don't use stronger material to build those gears. The cheap plastic they use will break sooner or later.Save your money and buy a high quality blender/food processor. Remember, you get what you paid for."
3,Love it but can't recommend it...,"I bought this machine about 8 months ago and just adore it. I make lowfat smoothies with it. That is its' main function for me. I too wanted to tell whomever would want to know that the plastic piece on my base broke. I glued it with ""gorilla glue"" and it held for about 3 more uses until it broke again. I am now so addicted to using the machine, I am desperate for another. By the way, 2 of my colored lid covers are broken as well."
2,Warranty not honored. Beware Homeland Housewares,"I bought a Magic Bullet in May '05. It worked great for 5 months and then the plastic drive gear stripped on the base and took the one on the blade with it. The manufacturer will not sell the gears separately and refuses to honor the warranty since I bought from an online distributor instead of off the TV ad.I have pages of e-mail dialogue with the manufacturer where I asked about the warrany, got a rude response, and then offered to buy the parts, only to be told they don't sell them, but would be happy to sell me another complete base unit for $30 + $10 shipping.I would buy another make and take my chances."
1,Waste of Money,"I received this product as a wedding gift. I tried it out, and the blade broke the first time I tried it. It had a ""one year warranty"" so I called the company and they refused to accept it. So if I wanted a new piece to replace my also new piece that broke the first try, I would have to send them 8.95 plus shipping and handeling. After arguing on the phone for almost a half hour with what they consider customer service, they told me to call back tomorrow. Do not waste your money on this, it is cheap and broke the first time. The company is useless and will just try to sell you new broken products."
1,Don't buy this Magic Bullet,"The cross and flat blades cuts the plastic and I ended having my food with black blended plastic. The new replacement blade broke down after 3 times of use, this time the blade just came off loose. I've given up on this Magic Bullet and now the base and the many cups with the accessories are using up space in my cupboard."
5,Works Well...BUT,"...very expensive for what you get. If you do not mind the cost, the quality is unsurpassed.I just love the coconut smells...Happy Holidays,Smacka"
4,A grip that helps,The Ruger LCP is a snappy pistol to shoot. The Hogue grip really helps to resolve the issues of being able to hold the gun during firing.
2,ripped,as soon as i tried to put it on my lc9 it ripped i now have to send it backand figure something else out!!
4,"Good, but not great fit for Ruger LC9","I bought these for my new Ruger LC9. Trick to getting them on is use a heat gun or hair dryer to warm up the rubber before and during assembly. That way you don't have to deal with moisture issues. It takes most of the effort out of installation. The fit on the LC9 was close, but required trimming around the mag release and the butt so that the mag wouldn't hang up on excess material. The LC9 was a little skinny for my hand and this added just the right amount of bulk so my hand fits naturally."
5,Great grip.,The grip works great on the Kel-Tec P-11. I only needed to trim a small sliver from the product where it meets the magazine release button to keep it from interfering with the button. But this grip isn't for guns with a grip safety. Using this grip on one will permanently deactivate that safety feature of your weapon.
3,Grip for Kahr PM9,"Purchased this grip because description included a picture of the KAHR pocket handgun wearing the grip. The description says fits MOST pocket guns, however it barely fits the PM9. It was EXTREMELY difficult to fit on the handle."
1,Tore product while trying to install,"the grip ripped while i was trying to install onto my pistol grip.I was as carefull as i could be, i thought.now its trash..."
3,Not for a Taurus PT 709 with a Crimson Trace laser,The grip was not much of a problem getting on the pistol. My problem came when I got my Crimson Trace laser. The laser fits around the trigger guard which will not fit into place as long as the grip is in place. You can cut the grip for the laser to fit but there will not be much left so I took it off. If you don't use the laser this is a fine grip and adds a little beef to the magazine housing of the 709.
1,Disappointed!,"This was to be used on a Ruger SR9C. I followed the directions and heated it before trying to put it on. It ripped before it was half way on. Poor quality rubber, I do not recommend."
2,grip,I like the grip it fit my hand well but it was tight to get on my gun and it ripped in The middle it was pretty cheap made I need a refund
4,Very pleased,"The only decent option for the M&P Shield. Fits well considering this wasn't really made with this gun in mind. A little difficult to get on, will definetly need some hot water encouragement and possibly some very slight trimming at the bottom. Overall, I'm very pleased. I now have a Hogue on all 3 of my pistols and wouldn't have it any other way. It greatly increases grip and comfort."
3,I wish it fit,I like this but didnt like that it wouldnt fit on my taurus 738 but Im sure that if it did then I would have it on my taurus now.
5,Just what I needed,"Very easy to put on and trim to size. Makes the grip of my pistol super sticky, technical term, and easier to control during firing exercises. Definitely a great buy."
5,Hogue Handall Jr.,"Perfect fit for the Taurus Millennium Pro in .40S&W. It takes a little work to get it on there, but fits great once you do. Provides just enough of a finger groove below the trigger guard to improve grip dramatically. I will definitely be putting Handall grips on other pistols in the future."
3,The Hogue Grip for LaserLyte Side-Mount Laser Sight,"While Hogue has a new custom grip for the Ruger LCP, this Handall Jr. grip sleeve is the ONLY Hogue grip which will work with the LaserLyte Side-Mount Laser Sight. As mentioned by others here, it did require some minor exacto knife cutting at the bottom to fit along with mounting upside down for me.Edit....after using this, I find it is too loose/slippery and slides down the grip after firing just a few shots using the Weaver shooting method. I purchased the Pachmayr Tactical Grip Glove for Ruger LCP to replace it. It does not slip and no cutting required."
5,Fits my Kel Tec PF9,"Before I purchased this grip, it was almost painful to shoot my Kel Tec PF9. Now, with the addition of this grip and the magazine extension, it has been more of a pleasant experience to shoot. The only thing I had to do was trim a small piece off the front of the grip because it would wrap around the bottom of the mag well and come in contact with the magazine. This might only be a problem if you have big hands such as myself. The space between the trigger guard and the finger notch on the grip is too small for my middle finger which causes the grip rubber to slide down and come in contact with the mag well. I used a razor blade to trim the piece of rubber causing the problem and now it works great."
5,Hogue Rubber Grip,I put this on my Kel-Tec PF 9 And I have to say it's a good ad on for the gun. It works better upside down if you have big fingers. I would recommend it to a friend.
4,Good,"Grip was a very tight, snug fit around the handle of my Kel-Tec PF-9. Gave it a more full grip and is now easier to hang onto."
3,"good, but it broke.","seems liek ti would go nicly with my gun, but as i was installing it on my vz 82 it ripped straight down the seam. so now im out a rubber grip. so be very careful about installing it."
2,Didn't workout for me,"During installation while following the instructions, the grip tore down the seem with ease. Was installing it on my Keltec P9F."
4,Very Nice,"I found the Hogue Rubber Grip very secure and a very complimentary for my firearm, which is fairly wide but the factory grips (on both sides) were cracked. Unfortunately, I never had the opportunity to fire the weapon prior to the addition of the Hogue grips. But I was very pleased with how the grips felt when I did fire the pistol.Perhaps the only draw back I found with the Hogue grips was that the pistol I placed the grip on, though a compact has a double stack magazine. The included instructions recommended working your fingers in under the grip to pull it up the side of pistol. I tried this but only managed to tear the grip. I tried the handle of some plastic ware but decided that a popsicle stick worked better.I have only put 100 rounds through this pistol if I find that there are any concerns further down the road I will update this review."
2,Mickey-Mouse Grip,"When reading the reviews for this grip, I found only one that related to the gun of interest, a Diamondback 9mm. Depending totally on this one review, I decided that a $10 investment was a low risk expenditure, so I ordered it. It does add some ""meat"" to the thin, comfortless handle, but not much. Once the grip is installed as far up the handle as possible, the protruding finger separator is too close to the trigger guard, unless the user has very small fingers, so the grip must be lowered which will then require trimming off the grip at the bottom. In short, I will not buy another generic grip for any gun, I've learned my lesson. In sharp contrast, the Hogue grip I purchased for my Sig P238-.380 is fabulous. This is not a generic grip, it was made only for this pistol. I don't recommend this grip, at least for a Diamondback pistol."
3,RUGER SR9c beware!,"I bought this for my SR9c after reading reviews of it on a Ruger forum. Well everyone said ""it fits great""-total BS. First off this thing is tiny.-tinier than an SR9c grip! I warmed it up and pull/pried and it ripped in the back near the top. I called Hogue for a replacement. They said it'd fit just spray windex and warm it up. So I tried that with my ripped one and it FINALLY went on. Now I'm waiting for my non-ripped replacement from Hogue to show up to try that one-we'll see..."
3,Not bad,The grip did what it was supposed to do. It made handling the gun a lot easier but it doesn't quite fit the Walther PPS perfectly. Ill use it for know until i find a better fitting grip.
4,Kel Tec PF9,Works well on the Kel tec PF9 but did need about 1/8 of an inch trimmed off the end to not interfere with the magazine.
1,Cheap rubber product!!!!,Tore after 3 use at the range. I will just make my own using tape and a youtube video. Thanks for nothing.
4,Hogue Rubber Grip Handall Jr.,"The only reason that I am not giving them a (5), is because when I had questions, they NEVER replied."
4,Grip Good!,Thought it was the wrong item at first but it stretched as much as it needed to and makes a nice difference in the grip.
5,Perfect to put a little more grip in your hand,"I have a Ruger LC9 for my conceal & carry sidearm. Great gun, but I have large hands, and since the gun is designed for concealment, it is very thin...a single stack 9mm. I wanted a bit more size in my hand than the LC9 came with stock. The Hogue Jr. is PERFECT. Widens the grip just enough to feel more substantial, and it is easier to get a good grip on rubber than it is the gun itself. It fits VERY tight, so it takes a little effort to put on, but won't slide around once its installed. It stays put. Great buy for the money."
5,Perfect for LC9,"Although I love the LC9 without the Hogue grip, it's even better with. The grip's tacky, and makes it easier to pull from my IWB holster."
2,to diffcult to get on handles,when trying to but on grips ripped a piece off rubber and then i toss then away. money spent foolish lee. will not buy this product again.
1,wont work with crimson trace laser sight,it is a alright grip but it was stupid for them to recomend it when I bought the laser sight cause you can not use the grip if you put the sight on so I was sadly dissapointed. But if you take your sight off then the grip is well worth the few dollars it cost dont remember but under 10 buck. Not even worth returning. Did ship real fast got all in just 5 days including weekend.
3,only fits small compacts,The product works. It will only fit small compacts. I made a mistake thinking that it will fit my other bigger compacts. No matter how I tried it would not fit and end up tearing it.
5,Reasonably priced & does what it says,Works very well on my P3AT. It works even better when mounted upside down on this particular gun because of the small size.
5,Fits Beretta Neos & Taurus PT709 Slim,Be sure to soak in very hot (not boiling) water to soften up before sliding onto grip. Works very well on the guns mentioned in the subject line.
5,JR. handall review,"Prompt shipping, as for the grip it was a perfect fit for my Millennium PT111 9mm(the original). The rubber adds overall width to the grip(rubber thick in center area). Also the extra finger bump adds a feel to the gun it did not have before.I did not need to trim the grip at all, and installing was VERY easy."
4,not bad,i used this for my Ruger LCP .380 and I had to cut about a 1/4 of the rubber off the bottom to make it fit. Works well though and satisfied with my purchase
4,PF-9,This grip conforms to my Kel-Tec PF-9 very well. I have shot my PF-9 a few times and it definitely has a great feel to it and help keep my PF-9 from slipping with its very noticeable kick.
2,Glock 26,"if you have a glock 26 forget it.... it wont fit its too small, it took A TON of force but I got it on and it needed trimming get something else."
2,Can be misleading,"This appears in ""customers also bought"" with the Crimson Trace trigger guard laser for Ruger LCP. If you have the Crimson Trace, this product can't be used."
1,DOES NOT FIT RUGER LCP!,"This came up under a search for Ruger LCP accessories. While the width is not a problem (it will wrap around a Ruger LCP with some effort), it is TOO LONG for the Ruger LCP. Some of it will hang out. I don't recommend this for the Ruger LCP. If you really want to buy it for the Ruger LCP, then be prepared to cut some of the grip with scissors to make it short enough to for your Ruger LCP."
1,Doesn't fit LCP,"When searching for the Crimson Trace laser for the Ruger LCP this grip shows up as ""suggested item"". Don't waste your time or money it is to large for the gun. Lucky for me it fits the LC9."
1,I thought maybe it could stretch a little...,"I tryed putting this on a Hi-Point C9 given the crappy ergonomics of the gun. I was sliding it up the handle and then the grip gave out on me and torn right down the middle. I don't know, seems like it would help if the description was more informative, maybe give a sizing chart or an idea of what would fit your gun. I know the handle is not as long as most guns so I got this one, I don't think it's that much wider though. I feel like I wasted $8."
2,tore during installation,"I didn't have a good experience with this product. I followed the instructions closely, but somehow tore the grip during installation. My experience is probably due to my extremely huge muscles and lack of patience. For 7 dollars it isn't really worth returning and I'll never buy this model again."
1,Split at Seam,"I ordered this for a Taurus PT 140 after reading reviews from many different sources saying this gun used the Handall Jr. We were really exceited when receiving the package, we boiled the grip to loosen it up and stretch it out. When we put it on, it was still very tough so we boiled it longer and continued to stretch it in between taking it out of the water and putting it back in. When it was finally stretchy enought to put on, we started slowly working it up the grip of the gun. Then it split in the seam of the grip and is now useless. I also bought the pink Handall Jr. for a Bersa Thunder, and had the same issue."
1,Not for the Ruger LCP,"Too big for the Ruger LCP. Required too much trimming, then after it looked like a cheap after market grip that was too big for the gun."
3,I'm sure it's a great item but for the right pistol...,This item item came up in a search for a beretta nano grip. So I figured I'd give it a try. It doesn't fit very well. I had to trim some of the length off of it because it was to long. It was also very very very tight and difficult to get on. Probably a better fit for a kel tech.
2,Not a good size,"Not a good size and hardly fits any of my micro guns. I had to cut it like the directions suggest, which just ended up being a disaster..."
4,Nice tight fit.,"When I pulled it out of the package,I thought no way this is going to fit. I have a Taurus PT140 Pro, just follow the directions and work it on. Looks like it's made for it. Have not shot the gun with the new grip yet, but it has a nice snug fit. Ithink it will be fine."
2,Grip,"Its make the grip ""fat"" or a lot wider .After you put it on you have to trim it with scissors or something else "",hope that turn out good"". It also makes your finger ride high on the gun ,I install it and removed it ,didn't like it. If you have a bigger or fat fingers, ""like mine"" this is Not very good item .Hope this review helps."
4,Hogue Handall Jr. Rubber Sleeve,The rubber sleeve was a perfect fit for my Kel-Tec P-11. Just make sure u soak it in warm water for a minute or 2 just to give u more play to pull over the grip. It also lowers the recoil for quicker follow up shots. Nice product for Hogue.
5,Hogue Universal Grip,I ordered this to keep my grip size small but yet add the comfort and control that I needed.This served both requirements very well.I would recommend this to anyone needing the same features.
5,Skye's Heavenly Voice,"Skye's voice is so beautiful, her lyrics so true that it will reach your soul, brings tears to you eyes, and peace into your heart. Kudos to the musicians, heavenly! I cannot wait for Skye's next CD!"
4,A useful reference.,"This book surveys the Bible's apparent contradictions. The book begins by explaining the origin, design, and results of these apparent contradictions. Next, the book cites each set of apparently contradictory verses and summarizes the explanations Biblical scholars give to resolve the apparent contradictions. The summaries are clear and brief, sufficient to satisfy the believer's concerns. The summaries don't seem likely to convince the unsympathetic non-believer, though.Interesting note: It looks like the publisher took the galleys from a very old book called _Discrepancies of the Bible_, slapped a new cover on it, added ""Alleged"" to the title, and put it on the market. The book's typography, except for the title and copyright pages, looks like something from 1900. It's telling that no work cited in the bibliography was published later than 1845! I did not find this to hinder the book's usefulness, however."
2,Not the Real Thing,"I think John Denver was concerned about losing some of his popularity and this album reflects his attempt at ""throwing something against the wall and seeing if it sticks."" John was not Bob Marley nor was he Bruce Springsteen. He was best at being himself. The thing about it is, the lyrics still reflect his true self, but he tried to put them to music that just wasn't him. Later on, I think he realized why we bought his albums and tried to go back to that successful formula. Unfortunately, his untimely death came before that reached fruition."
2,A Different Sound for John Denver,"This album has a completely different sound and feel than John Denver's previous albums. While the songs are not unpleasant to listen to, many of them do sound canned or forced and the tender and careful rendering the musician usually lends to his creations is absent. One can expect changes in an artist's style and music as the years go by, but this particular album is completely uncharacteristic. Had it been someone else, I would have thoroughly enjoyed it but this is NOT the John Denver most people would be familiar with."
4,Personal Denver,"This album is not popular with those who prefer ""Country Boy"" Denver, but it's my personal favorite. It's dedicated to the memory of his father and includes a musical setting of ""High Flight,"" a poem that has private resonance for me and my own aviator father. The title song is my all-time favorite Denver piece, the voice of John Denver, humanitarian. This album is more ""produced"" than his early work, part of his effort to evolve as public taste changed, which is a challenge for any performer whose career spans decades. You won't hear any twangy bluegrass nostalgia here, but you will hear a mature songwriter at the top of his form, with something to say about humanity in that clear, pure voice. I challenge any Denver fan to listen to ""Wild Montana Skies"" without singing along."
3,ok JD album..,"This is not at all a bad album. But if you're a fan of his live performances and early studio albums (like me), it will take some time to grow on you."
2,Nope. Doesnt do it.,"Everybody needs a 303 is a tune that doesnt meet the legendary fast movin', fast groovin' FatBoy standard. Slow paced and with few cameos, Im sorry but 303 gets a thumbs down merely for sounding pretty daft."
4,everybody wants a 303,yes very minimal but not like moby 's newest but very old school. this guy is a master
2,Where was the editor?,"As a novice to securitizations, I can't speak about the merits of this book in comparison to its peers. However, I will say that it is neither a reference book nor a novel. The overall structure and organization of the book was horrendous with stories leading nowhere and technical examples blurted out onto the page without thought to a fundamental theme or why they were offered. An example is not a good teaching lesson if it doesn't relate to a fundamental point.I don't blame the author because she is obviously skilled and well informed. I do blame the editor for not reviewing the book more carefully. Wiley shame on you!"
2,Technically average with some industry color,"From the vantage point of an experienced financial risk management professional, I found this treatise on CDOs and other structured financial products a technically average effort. I do believe that Tavakoli's book would be useful to those looking for an introduction to such financial instruments and those seeking some industry color; she does provide real life examples to help the book along. As correctly noted in a previous review, the author seems more cautionary or paranoid of the use of these types of financial instruments. Obviously a case can be made that intentionally misused or ignorantly applied, these financial instruments can be lethal. Although an unlikely possibility, this type of book should be read by any director of a public company that uses these instruments. If on the other hand you are seeking a solid technical resource, my opinion would be to look elsewhere."
1,Oneness:Silver Dreams Golden Reality,"I am a Santana fan , but this album(cd) comes up short. To sum it up , if I accidentally misplaced this CD , I would not waste any energy trying to locate it. In my opinion , ""IT'S TERRIBLE."""
2,Minor Effort,"Oneness is a minor effort by the great Carlos Santana. The songs seem to be cut off very quickly as the extended solos just come in. Knowing Santana is a perfectionist makes me think that this was probably for the best. The art work and surrounding message are very spiritual, a little cultish looking back from our perspective and perhaps a little baffleing if you're not very familiar with eastern religion. He has some good moments as he does in all of his work especially in Song for Devadip. However, if you're not a very devoted fan I would stick to Barboleta, a very good album. There's nothing on Oneness that Santana hasn't done much better elsewhwere."
5,complete satisfaction,It's a wonder why it took so many years for this title to come out on CD. This would be a good introduction for anyone wanting to get a feel for Santana aside from his other titles such as Supernatural.
5,A must have!!,"If you are a Santana fan, a music fan or a guitar enthusiast Oneness is a must have for your collection! It is truly Carlos unleashed. Enjoy!"
2,Not acceptable,"I have read through the book and am not satisified. It is so elementary and provides no concrete ideas. Things such as ""don't travel in packs"" are listed throughout the book. I suppose if you have any sense of direction in the dating game, stay away. Guys: there are much better books out there."
1,Do not buy this book,"I should youtube Susan Rabin first to see if her writing is any indication of her personality. Her writing is all over the place and she appears through her writing to be extremely hyper with thoughts coming and going in every direction with no rhyme or reason to them. I had to go over several parts a few times to try and understand if the example scenario was a success or not a success. At times, I didn't have a clue as to what the point was. The only one I can remember takes place early in the book: It's the scene where she ran into someone in the airport and she glances at her watch and leaves the person she was talking to. I had to read it a few times...was that a successful encounter or not?? I had no clue. What LITTLE useful information that is in the book could have been put into a pamphlet of 5 one sided pages. Her writing is awful. The book is a mess."
4,I loved it!,"A wonderful 'how to'book. The authors encourage people to relax and reach out...a very important message. Where do I meet my soulmate??? Everywhere!!!! What do I do after I say ""hey""? You'll learn it in this book."
5,This is a great starting point if you're looking for answers,"The advice is practical, there are no gimmiks and it's a quick, easy read. The book does a good job of pepping you up to actually use its advice, which is basically to use every opportunity to flirt with and talk to the opposite sex. I like the fact that she points out that you'll probably get rejected 9 out of 10 times, but it's just a series of experiences that you shouldn't take so seriously. Great stuff."
4,How to Flirt,"Susan Rabin has definitely had experience flirting, as is evidenced by this book. If all you care about is flirting, this book is most definitely for you. I, however, wanted to take my game to the next level, & am much more satisfied with Fate & Reil's How to Have Sex with Hot Girls (without even dating them!), & Louis & Copeland's How to Succeed with Women."
3,Easy to read,"A light read. A book you should get at the library rather thanpurchase, because you can read it quickly and you probably won'twant to read it a second time. Mildy entertaining but not a bookI would wish to own."
3,It's a good start in the right direction,"This is the kind of book for young, single people who are just getting into the dating world. There are a lot of tips in here that will jump start them into being more appealing to the opposte sex. For those of us who are older, and wiser, you may want to pass on this one. All though, there are some things in here that you may have forgotten in the past. It's still worth a look, in case you may have forgotten the little things that can help you on being more appealing and interesting to the opposite sex.Perry Rose, author of Women, Sex And Dating, For The Single Man & I Love You...Will You Marry Me?!"
3,It's okay but dont put too much trust on it...,"The book gives you some tips, but sometimes you just cant resist to laugh at some of the suggestions. The book has good advice on certain situations but fails on important areas. Not everybody is friendly out there...and some of the ideas this book gives you are just out of the real world we live in...it's a jungle out there and Rabin thinks we are in ""wonderland"". However if you are new to the dating scene, this book will give you interesting tips, after that you will need to get a more in depth book."
1,Not much substance.,"This book is fluffy and trite. I attended a seminar in NYC around May 1999, that Susan Rubin conducted based on this book (then read the book). Again - trite, cutesee, and at times a bit condescending.With the plethora of at least decent dating books out there, don't bother with this one."
4,A FINE BOOK BUT WE CAN DO IT WITHOUT HER OBVIOUS ADVISES,A fine book for causal reading and might give you some ideas and inspiration. It might be VERY useful for some clueless persons. But I (and I think a lot of other guys) won't treat it too seriously.
5,"Good, practical advice","Guys, especially, can learn a lot from this book. It's full of helpful hints for those of us who are shy or not naturally outgoing, and it provides some insight into the female value system -- so often such a mystery. Well worth the read, and the price: mere peanuts if only once successful."
3,Small Book is not Ground Breaking,This book is ok. Some might find it useful. I'd say someone new to flirting completely will get more from this book that someone who is looking to improve their flirting skills. Many of the examples Susan Rabin gives are cliche' and outdated. I was shocked at how similar this book was to the information publicly available at http://www.sirc.org/publik/flirt.html from the Social Issues Research Center in Oxford.
1,nothing new,"If you're totally clueless about interpersonal communication and psychology, you might might find this book to be a decent primer. At age 33, I just didn't learn anything new at all from it.I found it to be mostly trite common sense, and the endless peppiness and contrived wittiness got on my nerves.The book is outrageously mistitled. It most certainly will NOT teach you ""how to attract anyone, anytime, anyplace""!!! It doesn't even pretend to teach you that. No book could.I was hoping for more ice breakers and conversation starters. I already know not to stare at a woman's body or stare at somebody across the room too long, not to brag about myself, take an interest in her, be a good listener, etc. The very few conversation starters it did give were pretty lame. I mean, who's going to walk up to somebody and ask ""what's an adventure you've had that stands out in your mind?"""
2,Disappointment,"This book really is a disappointment, especially after I read all these positive reviews on here. The author seems more intereted in being bombastic than getting her point of view across and those with a limited vocabulary are going to need to pick up a dictionary with this selection.This book, altho crammed with advice, adds nothing to the genre whatsoever, and taking notes on a discussion with your mother on this topic can save you your 12 dollars. Furthermore, speaking as a guy, most of this advice will make you come off as too nice, which is not what you'd like to do, especially if you're interested in the lady you're conversing with.Unless you're as blind as a bat in the area in your life, you can do much better than this book."
4,7 year old loved it,On the recommendation of a friend we got all the books in this series and my 7 year old daughter read them all within a week. My 5 year old son is anxious to get started on them after hearing her praises.
1,The Mystery of Hermit Dan,"I ordered The Mystery of Hermit Dan (Liza, Bill & Jed Mysteries)that is pictured above and also was pictured at the time of order. Unfortunately I received Hermit Dan, by Dell Publishing which is not the same book. So I am not happy with my order and it is being returned. Sorry."
2,"Interesting movie, but..","This girl was terrible. Her acting was awful. She barely showed any real emotion, even when raising her voice to her mother. That could have been way more emotional.And she always had her eyebrow cocked up. it annoyed the crap out of me."
1,Painful dialogue,"This is all around bad. It has the kind of dialogue that makes you scratch your head and wonder if the writers live in this universe. People just don't talk to each other or react to each other in such archetypal ways. It's an insult to the viewer's intelligence. The acting is poor throughout, as are the editing, the camerawork... avoid. This must have been a Lifetime movie of the week or something. It lacks all subtlety."
1,Didnt last long,"I purchased this item to replace the original Battery, and it only lasted about 6-8 monthsI'm currently using the power supply instead"
5,A Must Read Workplace Survival Guide,"The dot-gone economy has taught millions that changing jobs is not the solution to success in work or life. Love The Work Your're With provides a road-map and tools to find personal and professional fulfillment at work. Each of the six steps in Whiteley's approach provide specific assessments, tools, and strategies to increase your level of engagement and energy at work. This book is highly readable, entertaining, inspiring, and filled with great examples. It is a must have self-help tool-kit for workers in today's complex work world. As a professional coach, I find this book to be essential for both my clients and their managers. If you've ever struggled with committment at work, read this book!"
1,KIS 6.0 Zonked My Computer,"Before buying, I downloaded and installed a 30-day trial version of KIS 6.0. First, I uninstalled Windows Live One Care. After installing KIS 6.0 and rebooting, my Windows XP Home Edition computer just locked up. Had to go through Safe Mode to remove the program via Windows Explorer, since Add/Remove Programs in Control Panel will not work in Safe Mode.When I reinstalled Windows Live One Care, it offered to remove the remains of KIS 6.0 that I couldn't.Next, Internet Explorer 7 would not work at some sites. Had to call Microsoft Support and a great technician in India took about an hour to straighten out the damaged files in IE7 at no charge. Thanks a lot, Kaspersky!Now, my computer is working fine. I am sorry that I did not have a chance to use KIS 6.0, but I will stick with One Care and renew it when my 1st year of free updates expires soon."
5,Kaspersky Internet Security 6.0,I find this program to be very thorough and is constantly being updated for virus and spy infections. It is very easy to use and their technical support is readily available. I have had other anti-virus and firewalls before and I find this one to be far better.
2,Slowed my laptop down,"I bought it because the reviews said it does not hog much room. But for some reason, it has s l o w e d my laptop down noticeably. I will be calling in for help with this because it's a new laptop."
4,"Not as complete, but better than Norton suite","Works quickly. As other reviews mention updates are frequent, but they are quick. Scanning is intelligent and learns as it goes - decreasing the time it needs to make scans. Customizable if you want or set it on recommended settings and away you go.Does not have all the disc maintenance that Norton does, but they are available elsewhere as freeware.It is odd that back when I was looking at this Amazon offered it bundled with the antivirus which is contained in this suite?! Pay twice for the same thing."
1,Horrible Customer Service,"Based on lots of great reviews, I decided to buy Kaspersky. After two months, I got a message saying my activation key was blacklisted. I sent an email to customer service and got an auto reply saying they were too busy to respond within 48 hours. Finally after three days someone got back to me and told me to try deleting and reentering the key. This did not work. I had to reply again to customer service and got the same auto reply. This time, no one ever replied. I sent another email threatening to write negative reviews of them and they still, weeks later, have not replied. I emphatically advise against buying this product. If you ever have a problem, you will not get help."
5,"""The Amazing Kaspersky""","Absolutely love this program. I'd been using Norton for years and so was initially hesitant to switch. Its not as user friendly as Norton and has the annoying habit of repeatedly asking for permission even after it has been granted. On the upside this feature adds to its efficiency and gives the user complete control over all internet activity, making it an exceptionally good security program."
5,Kaspersky Internet Security 6.0,So far so very good. Didn't tie up my computer like trend micro did. Will update if I have a problem...
1,Compatibility Problems,"Kaspersky Internet Security has serious compatibility issues with Microsoft Outlook. Once installed, Outlook is no longer able to connect with the mail server. Numerous discussions with support has failed to rectify this issue.If Kaspersky fixes this issue, I will update this review."
5,"Great product, great service","Working great on my new computer. Very user friendly; easy to install and work with. Good response times on the internet. Updates frequently, automatically, and invisibly. No more popup windows telling me I need to update. Initially I had a problem because I did not download all the updates. Worked with Kaspersky by email. Nice people to work with. Intelligent, understandable, polite, responsive, quick. Norton look out!"
2,"Problem with udates is fixable, apparently","This product blocked ALL my updates for days. I couldn't figure out the problem or clearly identify the cause. Then I went to the Kaspersky forum and found the solution, at: http[...]. That seems to have done the trick.They get one star for that alone. Honesty and clarity from a software firm is huge in my book. The second star is because they update themselves so often,(almost hourly!)but they lost the rest of the stars because they have not yet downloaded a fix.I'll update this review as my experience grows."
3,not too good,"hard to install, took me 3 days to install completely.now the computer is frequently down. not sure about the reason."
3,Kasperky Internet Security 6.0,Rated #2 in many independent reviews. Virus scan is dead slow and locks up to many prgrams causing you to reboot.
1,No help on installation from Kaspersky for 12 days...,"I purchased the Kaspersky Internet security 6.0 and could not install it. I reported it to Kaspersky and after 6 days of no word, I sent it back for a refund to Amazon. After 12 days I did get a reply which would not have helped as I had already sent it back. The answer did not address the error message I got anyway! If a security software does not help the consumer, then we must be back in Russia."
1,I had it installed about 3 hours,I downloaded the trial version - and I can't be more thankful I did. On their website they state that the trial is exactly like the regular version. My computer started acting funny...I would click something and multiple items would highlight. In email this happened and even when I clicked and had 3 items highlighted and managed to open one - email wouldn't delete. I couldn't delete this fast enough.
1,DON'T HOLD YOUR BREATH FOR A REFUND!,My computer was hijacked 5 weeks into a 2 year contract. I asked for a refund & all I was offered is more of their service. Spare yourself the headache. Try Trend Micro PC-ILLIN Internet Security.
1,Sub System Malfuntion,This is Malfuntioning piece of Junk. A Time consumer that drive you nuts.Anti Hacker sub System Malfuntion.Tech Support is Useless.They want you to do same things again over and over. Lot of Uninstalls and Reinstalls.
5,Best i have used,"This is the best Security Program i have used so far, it is fast, with daily updates and scans all possable areas. The best part is that is is easily to use and can enable only what you want, also it takes up very little system memory, i have noticed that my system, which is a little older now starts up faster and closes faster and i have little or no delay when opening applications."
4,Hasn't Failed Me Yet,"Kapersky was a much needed replacement for my computer security.I switched from Norton to Kapersky Internet Security when my Norton Internet Security program began malfunctioning like the HAL 9000 computer. I ended up having a professional computer whiz uninstall the Norton program. At the time I was told that the challenges I experienced with the Norton program were not uncommon. What were the challenges? I'm glad you asked.Norton Internet Security began blocking access to any ""https"" sites. As such you could access sites, such as banking and on-line catalogue ordering, but you could not log-on. The security icon would show that my computer was at risk, but when I clicked to get more information I was greeted with a warning that I was not an administrator. The system would likewise not allow me to disable the firewall or uninstall the program as I was not an administrator.Since I replaced the security program with Kapersky I have had no problems with my system."
2,Productivity Killer,The constant warning popups for every background process at every computer startup and every start of an application (despite the attempts to create rule and adding them to 'safe list') make Kaspersky a major nuisance and productivity killer.
3,Herb book,It is a 5 star book for someone who understands a lot of technical/medicinal terms and information. 3 stars for a person looking for simple answers. Phil
5,Good Reference,I use this book as a reference in my Naturopathic Consulting Practice. It affords me the knowledge to keep people safe in the use of Herbs. Thanks!
3,Helpful but incomplete,Good resource when taken in context. Does not reflect a familiarity with what herbs have to offer.
3,Potential :announcing the coming of vol 2,"As some reviewers may have stated Vol 2 is a much better book. the visuals in his one are slightly less captivating and composed. It gets a feeling of ""lets get naked and shoot"" at times.Vol2 is a much more interesting and thought out execution of Kroll's work. Much more worth the price of admission."
5,Prefer the electronic copy!,"Nice to search for your terms and theories electronically! It means you can't resell the book but saves so much time when doing research and reading it is definitely worth it! If possible I by all electronic books now! The book is necessary for most ethics classes and have a wealth of knowledge and things to think about, I haven't taken a recent ethics class but still reference it here and there personally when doing research and thinking about things! I bought both hard copy and electronic. I sold the hard copy but wouldn't have if not for the electronic copy!"
4,Columbia Diablo Review,"Boots are great. I started with a 25 miler and no blisters. Wore REI thick hiking socks. Nice dry boot. The lining inside the boot will collect seeds and stickers if you pass through grassy fields. I am coming off of a pair of Spirit Richles(sp?) and they were the best boots I have ever worn for backpacking. The Diablos are close but not quite as likeable. The Spirits were a little lighter. That said, I really cannot fault the Diablos. It is a nice boot and the amazon.com price was unbeatable. I would not hesitate to recommend this boot to you. I would give the boot 5 stars if the liner didn't collect things. It was a nusance to pick out the seeds at night."
4,Good job Yngwie!,"I don't have the version with the extra track, but I can still say that this a great album. It's kinda strange that Concerto Suite came right after it, because there's not much forewarning on this album. All the songs are great. Get also Alchemy. It's a cool album too."
2,Wish it came with a CD,"This is a great flip chart. The pictures and cute. The writing is clear. However, it doesn't come with a CD which is not as much fun. We got a similar one that came with a CD and we've used that one so much more!"
3,She's Gone is cut,"This is an excellent collection of Hall & Oates hits with few omissions. My only criticism, which is major in my view, is that they included the hacked version of ""She's Gone"". Not only does it cut out a great sax solo, but it actually drops an entire verse! If this is one of your favorite Hall & Oates tunes, like me, you'll cringe every time the song plays on this CD!"
4,Nearly Perfect,"This serves as a prime example of how truly great a ""Greatest Hits"" package can be. Every song is good. It really could use some updating and reorganizing, though. It's extremely unlikely that there's ever going to be ""Rock 'N' Soul, Part 2,"" for example. RCA should add some more songs and arrange them in a chronological fashion."
2,Regretful,"There is a skip in the CD, so I can't listen to all of the songs. I was disapointed with the selection of songs as well."
2,I Can't Go For That (No Can Do),"A rather thin collection of one of the best selling duos of all time. No ""Loving Feeling""? Also in need of further remastering. RCA needs to revamp this CD and reissue Apollo. These guys deserve better tratment from RCA."
4,Every song is a familiar one!!!,"This album is great in a way because I know every song on it, which for me is a big thing. I remember all of these songs from my teen years. ""Private Eyes"" and ""Kiss on my List"" were two that were very popular back in the early 80's. They may not be around much now, but these 2 guys made the sun shine for me."
2,Everything I wanted and didn't want,The selection of songs is SUPERB---truly the best of Hall & Oates with few ommisions. The problem is the recording from RCA stinks! Sounds like RCA taped their songs while they were playing over the radio. The remastering really put a damper on my enjoyment of the collection. Can anyone recommend a better recording of a collection of their greatest hits?
5,"Greatest Hits: Rock 'N' Soul, Part 1","Out of the 25 greatest hits CDs of various artists that I own so far, this is the only one that I can listen to straight through without becoming impatient, annoyed or bored; I don't have the urged to click on the fast forward button like I do with the other CDs (the others I purchased only if I liked at least half of the songs). I turn to this one when I need to get energized; it contains many upbeat tunes. Strangely, I don't even considered Hall & Oates one of my favorite artists."
3,Another enjoyable effort from your Uncle...,"A nice, enjoyable, soulful album with plenty of replay value."
3,Country is the new trend to latch onto.,"I like Uncle Kracker, respect him as an artist, but I kind of frown at the way he has changed. Take Kid Rock, who is from Detroit, and used to rp about the ""D"" , well now he has gone country. I could be wrong but how many John Deere hats, and pickup trucks were riding around in the hood while Kid Rock was ""Yodeling in the Valley"". Much like how white suburban kids copied inner city black rap artists and used it to push units. Kid Rock and Uncle Kracker have realized that country music sells very well, and have latched on to that trend. This is no better than all those shameless rap/metal Linkin Bizkit attempts by a litany of artists. Seems like Kracker and Kid want us to forget about their old sound. I like them, and can listen to this stuff, but I hate how they have created new personas and seem to pretend the old didnt exist."
3,"Not as good, but not bad","Decent CD, some really good songs, some not so good songs too. Best songs are Rescue, Blues Man, Songs About me, Don't Know How, and This Time."
4,"good, very good listening",This is an album you'll like the sound of within a couple of minutes of listening to it. And importantly its not cheesy. You can listen to it on a road trip or while working and it will keep you good company. Its not a *great* album that you'll talk about for years to come but it IS excellent steady listening. Its way better than other stuff being churned out nowadays.
2,Works great.....until it breaks,"My cooler worked great as long as you had your laptop sitting very precisely on top of it. Otherwise it makes a really annoying sound, b/c the weight of the laptop is too much for the plastic guarding the fans. One day out of no where the plastic that guards the fans started touching the blades somehow and the noise was constant. Product is good while it lasts.....which isn't very long."
3,Exercise-with-baby video,"This is a cute, low-impact exercise video for parents to do with a newborn. Less than half of the video is actual exercising, with the remainder taken up by discussions with doctors and new parents about various baby-care topics. The video is aimed primarily at dads, although moms may enjoy it too."
4,Mr. Hansen(Jimi Hendrix?),"I bought this album when it first came out in 1980, then I was lucky enough to see Randy play with the Band of Gypsies in San Francisco's Lindley Meadow( I think it was called) in Golden Gate Park as the headliner on the first of two days of free concerts there(Carlos Santana headlined the second day). Randy was superb and on the second day, I was lucky enough to spot him in the crowd wandering around and actually got to meet him and partake of some mood altering drugs with him(Pot)LOL. Fantastic guitarist and great album, especially like the songs ""Millionaire"" & ""Champagne and Cocaine"". Randy come back to the bay area and tour, would you? Kenster"
1,Look for the video review that gave it 1 star...,"...that pretty much tells the story.I WISH I had come to Amazon and read the reviews first. This is for Raid Ant Bait III and you can almost hear the ants say ""S'cuse me, pardon me"" as they step OVER the traps and keep going. Whatever is making it back to the colony feels more like an invitation or some kind of flash mob.I'd hate to admit that the problem actually seems to have gotten worse. Don't know if they're lured in by the bait and then don't bother?This is worse than losing money out of your pocket. Losing 5-10 bucks is bad but *paying* that to have a situation get worse is just awful.The only thing that makes me feel better is seeing that it's not just me."
1,If I Could give it 0 stars I would,I could not find Terro my favorite to get rid of ants. So I tried this. What a mistake. The ants did not go near it.My ant problem is worse now. I actually cut one open to see it it was the enclosure that was scarring them away. Nope. They walk right over it and did not stop! TOTAL waste of money. Do NOT buy this product.
2,Useless,"As the other reviewer said, I used this product and the ants walk up to it and they walk away! It's like they're saying ""you can't fool me!"" Pretty disappointing. My ant problem actually became worse with these in my house. Look for Terro Amazon. It has great reviews."
1,Worthless junk,"I have tried this product twice with the same effect: nothing. The ants are not attracted to it. Both times I used it, I put one on top of an active ant trail. The ants couldn't go under it, so they re-established their trail by going through it as if it was a tunnel on a model railroad train. They never took the bait. The active ingredient may do its job if the ants would take it, but the bait is a complete failure. Total waste of money."
1,Ant deterrent,"Got this from Homedepot and put them right at the ant trail. May be I did not read the instruction right, I think it works better as ant deterrent because they all walked right around it and minded their own business. I placed all 8 packs around the house and 0 ants walked into any of them!!! I should have read the reviews here before buying it!!!"
1,waste of money and time!!!!,Absolutely usless! The ants would not touch the baits. I can't believe that this product is for sale. It's as though Johnson has put plastic containers full of nothing into a box and stuck a sticker on claiming that they are selling a product that works which in fact it does not which is clear from all of the BAD reviews. I am truly disappointed and feel cheated!
1,Waste Of Money,I purchased a package of Raid Ant Bait III and placed them in areas where we were getting many ants.Initially I thought that we had failed to follow the instructions properly because the ants appeared to be specifically avoiding the traps. Four days after placing the little traps I was killing ants by hand and never saw one ant going near one of these traps. I don't know what kind of bait they're using but obviously it's not for ants.I research this product on the Internet for additional instructions and finally called S. C. Johnson for advice on how to activate the traps. I came to the conclusion that we had followed the instructions correctly but the product is simply a waste of money. I am confident that only the ants would give this product a good review.
1,Nice plastic but doesn't kill or attract ants,"I sat for half an hour and all it did was push the ants away. They touch it with one leg and walk in another direction without going inside. I also got Terro and within 5 minutes there were 6-7 dead ants and others that nibbled and went back in the nest, just what you want. Good stuff."
1,Total waste of money -Doesn't work,"The thing doesn't work. Period. Waited for 10 days, nothing. Then bought terro pco, and it started working after 5 minutes!"
1,Raid Should Be Sued For This!,I can't believe I bought this crap twice. I felt so good about Raid's name recognition that I assumed the first failure was a fluke. These traps actually repel ants! I'm embarrasses to tell you how long I've spent watching the traps and the ants won't go near it. I even put it in the middle of an ant trail and they just go around it. I even put a dollop of honey on it and they still won't even climb up to get the honey.This has to be the worst ant trap ever.
2,"These are worthless, but there is hope!","First of all, this is without a doubt a 1 star product. Absolutely worthless. But if you have foolishly bought these, read Kevin's explanation below of how to turn them into a semi-functional ant trap. After following his steps, these worked somewhat effectively until we bought better traps (Terro). It's absolutely inexcusable for Raid to still be selling these, but if you've already been suckered into buying them, might as well get some use out of them. Give it a shot!"
1,Buy Terro instead,"Eighteen other people can't be wrong! I purchased Raid Ant Baits and had the same experiences everyone else had. The ants were unaffected by the Ant Bait's presence. I threw my receipt away once I opened the product, but wish I could return it. I then read reviews online for Terro products, and although they are more expensive, they won't break your bank. Our ant problem is subsiding, NOT because of Raid Ant Bait, but because of a better product."
1,Worthless. There Are Other Options.,"Because of a sloppy cat, I have wet cat food all over the kitchen. First I triedTerro 1800Outdoor Pre-Filled Liquid Ant Baits, 3-Pack, but after four years, the ants built up immunity to them. Then I triedSafer Brand M198 Roach & Ant Killing Powder 16 Ounces, which works great, but leaves a fine white poisonous powder round that can get on a pet's paws. Finally I tried Johnson's Raid Ant baits. They were worthless. I even ran hot water through them and removed the cover and mixed up the bait. The ants just ignored it. Don't waste your money.However, I did find a miracle ant killer calledLilly Miller Brands #100500090 10PK Ant Control Stakeand it removed all the ants within 24 hours. I recommend that over this product any time."
1,Waste of money,I bought these baits a few weeks ago and placed all four against the counter wall. The ants ignore the baits. We have not seen any decrease in the number of ants.
1,Not for sugar ants,Just as well throw your money out the window. Sugar ants will not be interested in this bait. May work for grease ants. They need to put this information on the box label.
1,Does not attract ants! Waste of money.,"The Raid ant bait does not work. We had them out for several days and ants are still there whereas in the past, we used other brands that had a similar concept (small plastic contraption with bait inside for ants to bring to the colony) and the ants were gone in a few days. It seems like the ants are not attracted to this product judging from the looks of my kitchen."
1,We should sue them,"I evem did what the three star guy suggested: cut open the lid, cut out the extraneous flooring, added some sweet goodies to the peanut butter, mixed it. I put some of the mashed sweet peanutbutter and even smeared it along the path. The ants simply touch it for a fraction of a second, and continue their path. What an ingenious ""bait"""
5,Ancestral Roots of Certain American Colonists:,This book is helpful for people that are interested in pushing their ancestral lineages further back into the historical past. It helps if you have already done the preliminary work of researching your lines to the mid 1600's. The book deals primarily with royalty lines and their heirs. Some lines are documented as far back as 381 AD. It is always fun to learn about history by studying your own ancestors.
4,Very moving - a little rambling in places,"Swindoll does an excellent job of outlining the events surrounding the crucifixion, and at times, I was moved to tears. However, it seems that he had a word quota, because at other parts of the book, he just rambles. I also was very disappointed at several anti-Catholic comments, which prevented me from sharing this book with my Catholic friends. I was very enlightened by the information in the book despite my critical comments."
2,Pure Vanilla,"Straight, mainline Christian thought and theology...nothing that challenges the mind and thought here, nothing to make one grow...just a rewording and retelling of the old, old story.If you want pure vanilla Christianity, Christian pabulum, this is it....Nothing wrong with that, but there is little challenging and invigorating here."
5,Interesting,Well...this review is more for the content of the video. The video kind of the exact same points and the japanese pronunciations were a bit...british? no offense to british people but it was a very informational video. I would recommended it to anyone doing a paper or wants to learn more about the indigenous religion of Japan (Shinto). Happy watching~!
2,"Not a total waste of time, but...","This book has a lot of interesting tid bits and factoids about the life of Madonna, but as many previous reviewers have commented the writing is stilted, errors abound and the psychological mubo jumbo is annoying. The author seems to think he must beat us over the ehad with pop psychology connections to almost every incident he relates. Also, I haven't read tons of biographies, but the author seems to be incredibly detached from his subject, even for an unauthrized biography. I never got the feeling that he got to the true Madonna behind the public persona."
3,An OK biography,"One irritating fact over this biography, despite a few misspelled words in the text, was the repetition in one big way. OK... so Tiger Lillies are Madonna's favorite flowers. How many times does a biographer have to state that fact to make a point??? Overall this was an OK biography, however.I'm not a huge Madonna fan, but was curious regarding the hype over her career and this biography. She's had a few ballads I've liked in her career and they can be found mostly on one CD (""Something to Remember"".)"
2,Madonna who?,"(...)I looked at it while on line and I liked the pictures of Madonna and thought to myself let's buy it and see. I liked Andrew Morton past work with the late Diana, Princess of Wales book and I thought it would be the same.Oh what a BIG mistake buying this book it has nothing but what Madonna says on her interviews and the book had no plot it just went no ware I cannot believe that Andrew Morton would write junk but secound hand (...)."
3,Madonna's decent story,"When I first heard of the book, I thought it was going to be full of gossip. But that is not what I got. I read a book that told of Madonna, a daughter, an artist, a business woman and a wife. At times the book was boring, but whose life is always exciting. I read a story, whether it was all true remains to be seen. The only person who can tell Madonna's story is Madonna. Whether her story will be true, who knows. People don't always want the truth to be told. Bottom line: Madonna's decent story...."
1,Repetitive and inaccurate dribble,"Don't bother with this book. Not only is there nothing new, and does the guy fawn over Madonna, but this guy's facts are not straight either. Among other inaccuracies, he fawns over his subject to the point of stating things that are absolutely false, obviously to build her up. On 3 or 4 different occasions in the book he claims the material girl has had more top five and #1 singles than Elvis and the Beatles...and this is absolutely untrue. 3 or 4 times...Who is he trying to convince?No one but no one in pop music has ever had more than those two. The book is fawning and not completely factual, therefore it is a waste of time."
2,BORRRRRING!,"Firstly, as a 18 year long Madonna fan, I know a ton about her - why was her relationship with Rodman only commented on with a few sentences? The hilarious ""Truth or Dare"" is barely mentioned, especially since she treated most people in the film who worked for her loike garbage (such as when her make up girl was raped, she joked about it). And the errors in dates! Is there an editor at this publishing company or not? This book is very, how do I put it, dull. Go to a local used book store and by any used mass market paperback for a few bucks, because all the info from those books is in here. Some facts are at looked in depth, such as her hard days in New York in the late 1970s. But, there are so few unearthed facts, I say, WHY BOTHER!?!"
1,Not for Madonna fans!,"Avoid this book at all costs! As an avid Madonna fan, I can tell you that there is absolutely nothing new that one hundred authors haven't written about her!"
3,Interesting approach; average execution,"Andrew Morton's approach to describing the Madonna phenomenon is interesting in that he attempts to uncover what are the motivations that drive Madonna. I think he succeeds in that -- talking about her drive and insecurity. The book is an interesting read, however it falls short of puting Madonna in a broader perspective -- as a fascinating creation of American culture, as an entrepreneur and one of the notable pop music stars of the late 20th century. Other than her earnings and desire for control, Morton spends little time on the business aspects of Madona's success, which is no less fascinating than her musical accomplishments."
4,"Thorough and engaging, if not so well written...","As a loyal Madonna fan, I tried to resist buying the book, but I gave in. Though Morton's writing is weak, his subject is interesting enough to propel the book. Although it has been criticized for not really containing anything new, it is thorough (delving into Madonna's family history on both sides) and insightful. Morton has a tendency to analyze his subjects as if they were mental cases, and he does this to Madonna throughout the novel. His findings, however, are nothing new; Madonna needs attention, and Madonna needs to mother and be mothered. Nonetheless, the book is readable and insightful, and gives the best look that the public has seen so far at the woman behind the persona. Morton has done his detective work, and done it well, his findings giving some insight into the complexities that make the world watch Madonna."
2,Mistakes abound,"There are a lot of writing errors and problems with incorrect dates in this book. Morton also has a terrible style with no flow and too many commas.As a Madonna fan I found that his sources were somewhat credible but that he reads too much into small events in her life. He also mentions events out of order, perhaps to tease but mostly to annoy.Nice photo selections."
3,Last Day of Summer - A nice surprise....,"Joe, played expertly by the talented actor DJ Qualls and Stephanie, played by the beautiful Nikki Reed tells the story of insecure and frustrated worker at a hamburger joint who is belittled by his boss Mr. Crolick(William Sadler)to the point where Joe feels like he's at the end of his rope decides to take out his boss and the entire fast food place when a look from Stephanie stops him. Without giving too much of the story away, director Vlad Yudin's feature film debut is a decent little indie movie, worth watching."
5,Very different,I enjoyed the unusual approach to this movie. I found it intriguing and thought provoking. Teaches a person to reconsider how we treat people we meet every day.
2,Nikki Reed was great,But I hated and I mean hated the ending after seeing that it made the movie feel like a waste but certain parts of the movie did keep my laughing
3,More of an ozonater than an ionizer,"Tested the negative ion output with my ion detector. My detector only registers anything above about 700,000 ions per cm3. My large, powerful home ionizer sets if off at almost 3 feet. However, this ionizer does not set it off even when the tester is nearly touching the emitter. So it's ion output at any distance, even a foot or two, is probably very low.It certainly produces ozone. You can smell it if you put your nose to it. This would certainly reduce odors, and it also cleans the air. However, some people with bad asthma may be very sensitive to ozone.In short, if you want the make the car smell fresher, it is good. If you want the benefits of negative ions, probably not going to get it with this device."
2,Short Life of use.. but works!.,"This device is sturdy, but unfortunatly has a short life; work great!in a interior car enviroment. If you want between 3-8 month of use for this prize, it's ok.I would not buy it again, i prefer another one that has a little more time of use."
3,"12V, Mini Air Purifier/Ionizer Mini, Chrome",the air purifier was not as strong as i had hope for. it will remove some of the oder from the car but don't expect too much.
5,Roadpro Ionizer,"I order two of the RoadPro 12v mini air Purifier/Ionizer three weeks ago. plug one in to my wife 2008 CR-V, you can smell the Ionizer working. Plug the other one to my 2011 Honda Pilot in two days there were no more new car smell. This little thing killed the smell from the new car."
3,Air didn't get worse,My car has keep a fairly clean air smell. I like this and for the price it is economical.
2,Short lived,"After 3 months use, the outside tip has become corroded and the functionality is diminishing. Works well when new, but doesn't last very long."
2,"Works ok, lights are too much","Works ok bt it has cahnging lights, looks like I am driving around with a Christmas tree in my car :-("
2,don't work,"Does not work, my car looks like a christmass tree with the 3 colors led, it makes a bee like noise from time to time, and the aluminum body gives electrical discharges all the time (tried it in different cars). I bough another one at a store that works fine. Maybe luck wasn't on my side with this product. In any case would i recomend the product."
3,umm....,I have had this car ionizer plugged in for the past 3 weeks straight and I did notice a significant decrease of doggie odor. The instructions on how it works were pretty unclear but I guess it works because people can't tell I have a dog when they get in my car. lol.
4,that stinky cab,have'nt got to try yet but presume it will work on longer journeysalways wanted one of these for the home let alone the car man
5,Worked great for our two medium sized dogs.,Best deal for a dog about 20 in at the shoulder. Worked great for our two medium sized dogs. Easy to install.
2,very messy,This was quite messy to clean the screen--you just don't wipe clean. You had to get the sponge wet and then the screen was streaky so then you had to wipe clean with paper towels. Not very easy for a 3 year old. We didn't keep this toy long. Didn't know what I was going to do once the markers dried up.
3,There is still a way to get some use!,"My daughter received as a present at 3 years old. It was frustrating to have to scrub the screen constantly and dry it and then of course the markers that stain.So I took away the markers.I gave her a bottle of cheap lotion and a paint brush and also let her finger paint with the lotion.She would use a damp wash cloth to wipe it down herself and start all over.Although not exactly colorful, it still was entertaining enough for her. The lotion had almost a black light effect and would glow enough to keep her entertained for awhile, at least not as seriously messy as finger- painting or any paint for that matter.So, the product and how you are supposed to use it, is poorly made and cheap for it's overpriced tag.Would have been a great toy and it is a great idea, but as is now- disappointing."
2,adult supervision required,"We got this from Nana for my daughter's third birthday. I was sorely tempted to return it unopened! It has three markers included and several image sheets to trace. Every other minute my daughter wanted to change the sheet to a different picture. The 'eraser' include is a piece of a kitchen sponge. When I finally stopped changing the page, she decided to color all over her arms with the markers. She doesn't care that she can't trace the pictures. She likes to scribble. I'd rather just give her crayons."
3,Son loves it... I don't.,"My 4 year old received this for Christmas. I'm gonna have to agree with other reviews that putting the tracing template into the slot is way too difficult for a 33 year old, muchless a 4 year old. My son enjoys it even without the template, but cleanup is very difficult and messy. Better to stick to the ol' Magnadoodles."
1,kids may enjoy...but it's a mother's nightmare!!,"My daughter loves this toy.I, on the other hand, cannot stand it.I have actually tried to hide it from her.It is a mess! The markers are not washable, the screen does not clean up easily and the sponge that comes with it is practically useless.Plus, the tracing pages tear easily - they should be laminated.If you are interested in a doodle pro product, I would stick with an original."
3,Use dry erase markers!,"My daughter has had the Doodle Pro Glow for two years. When I started searching for new markers, it was extremely frustrating. You can only buy them in packs with templates. Since the markers make a mess and the sponge was lost long ago, we now use ""Foohy brand washable thinline dry erase markers."" I got them at WalMart. They are bright colors and the glow works great. Plus, no water and they are washable off hands and clothing. Hope this helps some of you looking for new markers."
4,Fun to draw and write on!,"It helps toddlers practice drawing and writing letters so improves fine motor skills. The best part is that the pictures are interesting enough to keep even 6 to 8-year-olds engaged. The drawbacks are that the pictures are not durable. So to make them last, laminate them. Also, if they made the markers in more different colors and the pad itself a little more compact it would be perfect! Overall, very satisfactory."
2,What a mess!,"This toy makes coloring cool. I really like the ""glow"" effect. Is it worth that cool glow effect? Noooooooo! The markers are easily lost, and the mess of cleaning the pad up is so not worth it. The marker just smears instead of wipes off. It gets all over everything. Yuck! Until they figure out a better way to clean the board, I would avoid this toy."
1,Markers stain!,"My 3 year old got this from my aunt and uncle and within 5 minutes had a permanent stain on her Christmas dress from it. As other reviewers have noted, the screen is a pain to clean. It will be going back. A regular doodle pro is a much better idea, won't stain anything, and doesn't need batteries."
1,Not a good idea,My 6 year old son with autism got 2 of these from relatives for Christmas. NOT a good idea. Not only is the cleanup horrendous...it is extremely tricky to get the paper to trace in the correct slot....frustrating!So....I write the alphabet on it and my son loves that....Poor thing is intent on trying to get it clean though.
2,MARKERS STAIN!!!,"The toy is fun for kids, HOWEVER....the markers stain! Your clothes, their clothes....it is bad. My son is within the recommended age for use but while wiping the markers off he was holding the marker in his hand and got it on his shirt. I can't get it off - have tried everything! DON'T BUY THIS OR LET THEM PLAY IN OLD CLOTHES!"
1,Not for a 3 year old..,My son got this for his 3rd birthday and it's too difficult & messy for him. Adult supervision is definitely required since it gives you several markers...a 3 year old with a marker is not a good thing. The sponge 'eraser' has to be damp and you then have to wipe it with a dry cloth to completely remove the marks. Older kids might enjoy this a little more.
2,Annoying to Keep Clean,"My daughter is 4 years old and LOVES to trace so I decided to by her the Doodle Pro Glow. From the outside it looked like a snap to wipe clean, what a mistake! First you have to make sure that your child does not smear the marker (which stains) all over the place, second they provide you with a tiny sponge (not the same as the picture on the box)and you have to wash it clean after every stroke across the board. I don't know about you but I get tired of running back and fourth trying to keep it clean. Third you then have to wipe the board clean with a dry cloth since the wet sponge never gets all of it off.Take my advice and pass up this toy and go for the simple Doodle Pro, much easier all around."
1,Very Disappointing!,"As others have said, this is a neat concept, but in reality, it doesn't work that great. After drawing on it, you wet a sponge to erase it. Think about a small child wetting a sponge. It ends up a dripping mess! Then they end up with runny marker all over their hands, which ends up on their clothes, etc. We're good about watching the kids, too. You really have to take control of the sponge and make sure the board is wiped properly before the kids use it. The other thing is that none of the colors glowed very well and the kids stopped using it after only a couple of days. Just a very disappointing gift. Fisher Price should have stuck with the original Doodle Pro... my kids have had it for a year and still use it!"
4,Detailed cat drawings,"Fairly high-detail line drawings of many species of wild cats, not for very young children. Great for aspiring artists!"
4,Good coloring book for animal lovers!,"My 6-year-old loved this book. He is obsessed with wild animals, especially cats, and this was a great informational book with a few facts and wonderul pictures to color. It kept him busy during church service, so he was able to sit still; and he learned something at the same time."
1,Switched front channels in DTS!,"I agree with the other reviewers that this is a spectacular production, BUT the DTS multichannel soundtrack has the two front channels exchanged, so a singer on the left of the stage sounds from the right. Once you notice it, it is such destracting and irritating that the whole experience is ruined. My complaint to C Major resulted in no answer. Therefore 1 point as a warning, both to customers and C Major, not to treat customers like that."
4,Distracting setup,"This was my first ""Das Rheingold"", and I found various aspects of the staging very distracting. For example, Loge moves around atop a Segway, which I found very odd (or just crazy?). Things like this kept me from paying close attention to the unfolding story: I only understood the story after watching the traditional Levine Met version (which is very fine). On the other hand, there are certain aspects to this production that I found very appealing, e.g., the use of the human body in it. Summarizing, I would recommend this disc to anyone who is already familiar with the opera, but not to newcomers to it."
4,Interesting and informative,"Mongello is a long time Disney World fan who has written a trivia book that will give the reader a lot of information that the typical guidebook will not. Of particualr interest to me was info on the age of some of the attractions as well as some history on popular attractions that are no longer a part of Disney World(such as 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, Mr. Toad;s Wild Ride, etc).My only gripe with the book is with the way it's laid out. You'll read a question on one page then have to get the answer to that question 20 pages later. It's not the way one typically reads a book. Still a very good book- 4.5 Stars."
3,Good information. Tedious format.,"After receiving this book, I discovered that it was not exactly what I expected. I was hoping it would be a book on Disney World facts, trivia, and history (as the title declares). What I didn't know is that the book is written in question and answer format--with the answers to all the questions at the end of each chapter. This makes the book structure somewhat unwieldy. I would have preferred it to be broken down by attraction or park element and then have all the information presented in paragraph format. This would make the book much more readable than it is in its present form."
3,Quiz Format is Inconvenient,"This book has all sorts of trivia points about Disney World, but they are all in a quiz format. Each chapter (broken out by theme parks and resorts) starts with about 100 multiple-choice questions, and then the answers follow in a sub-chapter. You can read just the answers, but the topic is not always clear without the context of the question (which is not re-stated for the answers). I would have preferred a simple listing of trivia items. The questions just add bulk to make the book seem bigger than it is. Next time, I'll just visit the numerous web sites that hold the same information."
1,1st time reviewer,"Interesting, but I hadn't expected the ""question/answers"" format. However, I am getting through it."
4,A Fun Guide For Seasoned And New WDW Visitors,"Being avid WDW fans, visting there every 3 months from Ohio, my family will find this just-published book fun to take with us when we visit, and also at home. It will be of value to newcomers and also seasoned Disney fanatics like my family. In its 224 pages there's something of interest to every member of the family, young and mature. The multiple choice questions make it a fast, easy read, and make it easy to retain the answers. We're glad to add it to our large Disney book collection. Recommended."
5,Great Book!,"We took our first trip to Disney back in September. We have another trip booked for this year. We have become a Disney family; my husband talks about Disney every day. We can't wait to go back.I bought this book for my husband for Christmas. He hasn't put it down since. He enjoys asking me trivia questions and then reading all about the correct answer. After seeing how much he loved the book, I went ahead and bought Volume II on Christmas day!"
3,confusing,"I am currently reading this book. I just returned from Disney World and wanted to know some trivia. The thing I do not enjoy about this book is that it is in two sections, questions and answers. To get the total concept of the book I have to keep flipping pages back and forth, from question to answer. If this does not bother you , it is a good informational book and fun to know how things are or were in some cases, in Disney World"
5,"Team, Individual and Organization Building for Free","What a great piece! This has helped me immeasurably in getting so much more out of my department and my employees from the most unexpected venue - meetings.It's about time someone identified how meetings can be something far more than time spent on an agenda and started mining for their greater benefits to the company and the individuals.As the author so cleverly points out, since everyone is already there, why not use the opportunity to do some team building, organizational aligning, information gathering from the shy or usually disenfranchised.Let's face it, meetings are not going to go away. But with this essay as a guide their value increases exponentially and in ways that no one could ever have planned or expected for the individuals involved and the larger organization."
4,History,I am a history major in college and this dvd was awesome. I enjoyed watching the different aspect of how the earth changed.
4,How the Earth was Made,"Perhaps not as good as Nova, but very interesting...worth watching more than once! I think kids would really enjoy the information, and the scenery is spectactular."
4,Cooke cooks,"I gave this a 4 only because it's a live album [which I didn't pay enough attention to when buying] and I'm not a big fan of live albums. If you're into live albums, this would be a 5 for sure. Sam's rapport with the crowd in between songs is excellent too. The most famous songs [must be famous because I know them tho Sam was murdered years before I was born] are here: Chain Gang, Cupid, Twisting Night Away, Having a Party, and some others too. All in all, a good way to spend almost an hour. Who knows what Sam could've done if he hadn't been killed when only in his 30s?"
1,They Ruined the Greatest Live Album of All Time.,The original 'Sam Cooke Live at the Harlem Square Club' was the greatest live album of all time. Listening to it you feel jealous of everyone who was there. Never has a singer and and his band his audience been so in sync with each other. The crowd singalong with 'I love you for sentimental reasons' is as magical a recording as exists. The call and answer 'let me hear you say yeah!' on 'Bring it on home' is as exciting as music gets. No wonder the women in the audience are screaming to what sounds like the point of orgasm.But this new mastered version takes all the audience vibes out. And it kills the amazingly hot sax counterpoints of King Curtis. Now it's just another CD. Man if aint broke don't fix it. But they did and they ruined it.
3,Ruining the sound away,"Rca/BMG is a strange company - they earned billions of dollars on Elvis and they still screwed almost all Elvis album reisuess with bad mixing and mastering. So, why would Sam Cooke be an exeption?Sound on this cd causes me a headache. A very good and exciting show of one of the greatest singers in popular music history unfortunately is very painfull to listen to.Bad mix, that's all - there is so many high level tones that i have to put the treble button on my reciever to zero. Up front in the mix are very, very loud cymbals (my god, it's noisy), Sam voice and flat bass. Audience, sax, gitars? Forget it..People at RCA/BMG are without any musical ear or they are completely deaf. Or maybe they just don't care."
5,Forget Best Live Soul Recording-It's One of the Best Period!,"This performance starts out great and builds and builds and bythe time it comes to an end you want more. It's only about 37 minutes long but it is amazing what it can do to your emotions in such a short time. Sam Cooke sings with the End of the World intensity. Maybe he knew what was coming because he would be gone in less than 2 years from this recording. You will get goosebumps as he segues from one song to the next. You feel the intimacy of the Harlem Square Club and feel like you are there.If you're down and out, this will lift you up. And if you think everything is fine, then this will make you question if everything really is. This will be a jewel in anyone's music collection."
5,"""Shake your handkerchief 'round """,Damn this album smokes!! We need soul singers like this again.Dynamic and powerful.
2,Terrible remix,"This is obviously a classic live recording, and of course Sam Cooke sounds great. But I don't understand all the great reviews. In case no one noticed, King Curtis is leading the band, and he's been effectively erased from this cd. The extra chatter is nice, but the music is what counts. Search out a copy of the original cd release; the artwork is lousy, but you can actually hear the horns."
1,"""Twistin"" edit","This is one of my all-time favorite live albums, and is possibly THE best live album around. I pretty much wore out the vinyl version, and purchased this remastered CD edition. My problem is a scratch or edit on ""Twistin The Night Away"" contained in the second verse. I returned the cd to the store I purchased it from, and they replaced it with another copy. Same Problem!!! 2nd verse starts off ok but you get a truncated version of it i.e. it jumps forward to the end of the verse and you don't hear it in its entirety. One time - manufacturer problem. Both copies - edited? If so, why? Can't be to fit the album onto CD as it only goes for about 40 mins. Lucky KC's sax solo was left intact (one of the greatest imho). I also agree with others re bringing crowd noise/participation and King Curtis up in the mix, as both contribute so much to this recording. Very disappointed."
4,"My review of One Night Stand: Sam Cooke Live at the Harlem Square Club, 1963","I also have the cd One Night Stand : Sam Cooke Live at The Harlem Square Club. It is a GREAT cd ! However the quality of the recording is not very good ! I still like it !!! It also seems that Sam put more emotion into this performance than I have heard him do before . His voice also sounds more expressive to me on this cd. However I had heard him sing in the past but, have only recently become a actual fan of his !! I gi gave it 4 stars because of the quality of the recording !!!"
5,A rediscovered jewel!,"This CD is a rediscovered jewel! The 50s and 60s were the heyday of great live R&B acts, but sadly, few films or recordings exist of these artists in thier rawest element, i.e., the Juke Joints and ""Chitlin Curcuit"" audiences of working-class Blacks. This is sam Cooke as he was among his true element, in this case the Harlem Square Club in Miami in January 1963. Raw, gutbucket soul in it's purified essence. Sam plays his audiecne like a fiddle and the best part (to me) is when he gets the audiece to sing with him on ""For Sentimental Reasons."" You can truly feel the bond between Sam and his brethren. But words alone can't describe it, you must go get it. For another great recording of Sam Cooke Live, check him out with the Soul Stirrers with a gospel audience in ""The Great 1955 Shrine Concert."""
3,Nice but not perfect.,"I always get a hankering for gingerbread and pumpkin bread when Autumn rolls around, but I'm never up for baking from scratch. This year was the first time I tried this particular mix. It calls for one egg, some butter, and some milk to be added to the mix, so quite easy to throw together.The result is a bit of a mixed bag. The texture and consistency is very lovely and moist; I'd grade it an A or A+ almost. Unfortunately the sweetness is underplayed to the detriment of the whole project. I have so far sampled it plain; I wonder if a scoop of whipped cream might mitigate the problem. Anyway, I might buy it again, or I might not."
4,spicy,"I used canola oil instead of the butter and it came out good. It is a little spicy, and you might want to add a little honey to the mix."
2,"GOOD ADVICE, BUT NOTHING NEW!","The content contained good advice so I will give the author credit for that; however, I found much of the material to be little more than good old-fashion common sense with a few ""cliches"" thrown in for good measure. Little of the material was so new or sensational that most of us have not heard or read it before in similar self-help books. It is standard advice I have been advocating in my classes for years. ""Learning to live in the present"" and ""living each day as if it were your last,"" is, without question, sound advice. However, statements of this nature, and many others found here, are so ""old hat"" they could be considered redundant. There are certainly other quality books in existence which I would recommend before this material."
1,You get what you pay for...,"While this was the least expensive option, the charger never worked well and broke after only a couple of days of routine use. The end was soldered on poorly so there was also a problem with incomplete charging. To be fair, I did not bother contacting the manufacturer for a replacement, so I have no idea if this was an isolated incident resultant from my own bad luck or if it was par for the course for them."
4,La Cage Aux Folles: The Broadway Musical (1983 Original Broadway Cast),"La Cage Aux Folles: The Broadway Musical (1983 Original Broadway Cast)is a recording with the original 1983 cast. The message is one of tolerance and being the way you are. The booklet contains a cast list, a synopsis and photographs from the time of the performances. However, no lyrics. Recommended. 4/5."
5,Great Soundtrack,"I absolutley love this CD. I purchased it for my parents, who are big fans of the play. The music is feel good and upbeat. If your a fan of La Cage Aux Folles, and familaiar with the music, this soundtrack is a must have."
5,LA CAGE AUX FOLLES,"ITS A MAGNIFICENT JERRY HERMAN WORK OF ART.20TH CENTURY FOX SHOULD SELECT A TOP WINNING PRODUCER AND DIRECTOR AND MAKE THIS THE TOP HIT MUSICAL MOVIE OF ALL TIMES .I SAY:""PEOPLE WILL NOT LEARN IF YOU DON'T TEACH THEM"""
2,Mediocre,"This show is amazing. The sets, costumes, dance, and characters are wonderfully penned and created. However, the CD leaves much to be desired. George Hearn doesn't have enough ""gay"" to make a believable drag performer. His version of ""I Am What I Am"" while true to the character, is not as beautiful or faltering as Albin should be. If you live in NYC, or are going, I reccomend the current revival, which needs a CD, as it is fantastic! However, I am sad that this is currently the only documenation of this show."
5,Tim Smith has never done anything less than perfect!,"I love him. What else is there to say? He has been playing great music since he was a teenager. He impressed me completely, when he was only 19 years old! And he has only gotten better with age. I'm so proud!!!"
4,I was there,"My parents took me to my first concet at the age of 4. The concert that they took me to see was Elvis at MSG. Now, only being four years old, I sure don't remember anything of the show -- although I have plenty of photos, including two backstage with Elvis -- that is why I went out and bought this cd. I was never crazy about Elvis' live material -- not a fan of live recordings at all -- and never really liked his post-1969/1970 work (some of it is great! Burning Love comes to mind). However, this album has more personal ties than anything. How many people can say that the first (or last) concert they went to was an Elvis concert?"
5,out standing performance,"elvis the king of rock, had just recorded burning love in march of 72, and his conquest of msq , was just another feather in his crown. all songs were great, and the recordings are very clean. the album was also released in the quadraphonic format via 8 track, which is a much superior rockin version than the common stereo version."
5,I LOVE THIS CD,My dad had bought this tape when my family went to Graceland and every vacation we listened to it. I recently bought the CD so I can listen to it in my car. I love Elvis and this cd. This is one of his top performances.
5,Elvis's New York performance,"I had a copy of Elvis's performance at Madison Square Garden years ago and loved it ,but lost it while moving. It's one of his top performances. The variety of music on this CD is truly Elvis at his peak. I finally got this copy and the quality is excellent. My Elvis music library's complete, once again. LOL"
4,My Response to those who say Elvis was washed up in the '70s,"Many Elvis fans will not take his '70s output seriously...they look at the impersonators and see a bloated guy with sideburns the size of muttonchops and white jumpsuits and instantly start muttering ""thankyaverrmuch...get me a valium 'Cilla."" But Elvis put on some hot shows in the '70s. I dare say his voice was at his peak up until about '73 (Aloha From Hawaii) and a crack band was crankin' behind him. Few things are more exciting than hearing the 2001 theme followed by the ""dun-dun dah, dun-dun durh"" horn riff of ""That's Alright Mama."" Not to be missed is ""Polk Salad Annie,"" either, a truly hard rocking gem. This is a great live album."
3,Somewhat disappointing,As a huge Elvis fan I found this concert and recording lacking. A die hard Elvis fan may want to have this in their collection but it's a bad choice for someone trying to discover Elvis at his best.
3,Slow it down,These Elvis live albums from the 70's have far too much Vegas influence. Not being a fan myself of rushing through songs as quickly and jazzy as you can rather than being true to the original recording I just can't get into these Elvis live albums. It would be nice if we could have some live performances from the 50's.Comment Comment | Permalink
3,Elvis Back In New York - It Could Have Been Any Town,"Ofcourse this album was very popular in '72 and deservedly so with some well-delivered material. But as a June 9th, 1972 Opening Night attendee (the day before this l.p. was cut) I have to presume that the delirious crowd reaction was not really captured on disc. What was captured was a fairly short, oddly paced set with disappointing ""updated"" arrangements of the oldies, and somewhat overproduced versions of newer tunes. They screamed for Elvis just as loud as at the Ed Sullivan Theater in 1956 and 1957, but this time the image seemed alot more important than the music. Only ""Never Been To Spain"", ""Polk Salad Annie"" and ""Suspicious Minds"" warrant revisitation."
3,ELVIS has almost left the BUILDING,"This was the start of the downward slide of Elvis.The Man was only 37,and he's off key and can't remember words to his songs.He almost sounds bored,and can't wait to leave. There are some fantastic moments,""America Trilogy,"" my favorite number,and ""HoundDog."" I love how Elvis starts this song.This was one of the biggest concerts ever, recorded live at Madison Square Garden in 1972,right after ""Aloha From Hawaii."" The sound of the record is not that great,but you can get this tape at some record stores for under 4 bucks."
3,Not The Best Elvis,"I've heard and sen a lot of Elvis concerts. Some are very good (the 1968 Comeback Special), others just depress me (1977 Elvis In Concert). This one's in between. The music's ok, but he sounds bored and anxious to end the show. The highlights on this performance are ""That's All Right,"" the rockous opener, ""Proud Mary,"" a good cover of the Credance Clearwater Revival, ""Suspicious Minds,"" a faster, more up-beat version than the single release, and ""Can't Help Falling In Love,"" the sweet ballad that closed most Elvis shows between 1972-1977. The low points are the shortened ""All Shook Up,"" the slower and less fun ""Hound Dog,"" and the painfully slow ""American Trilogy."" I think fans will enjoy this album but I would reccommend getting something better as well, like the Comeback Special or On Stage 1970."
2,Zero vs Wildcat -- Louis J Sheehan,"You'll learn about the construction and relative strengths and weaknesses of the Zero and the Wildcat, but, otherwise, the show revolves around a lucky find relating to the damage caused to this particular Wildcat's guns by some lucky Japanese shooting .... Louis J Sheehan"
4,Hot thong,"A little overpriced (of course), but they look amazing on. Bought them as a gift to turn her into a Bears fan - I think it worked. I love it when she shows her team pride."
1,Has nothing to do with poker,"This is a book of logic puzzles - the ones that tell you that six people named Alex, Bob, Carmen, etc. ordered six different flavors of ice cream, and you have to figure out who ordered which flavor.They are nominally poker-related in that they use things like six different poker hands as the variables you have to match to the six players from the clues, or five different poker shows on TV, and you have to match them to the fictional channel number they air on.All of the problems are completely generic, and could be changed to ice cream flavors or favorite colors or whatever else without changing the fundamental problems. The book has nothing to do with poker."
1,Worst Tiger Woods offering from EA Sports Ever.....CRAP!!,This game is the worst EA sports game I have ever played. Everything about this game is sub par compared to the other TW Golf games and is rip off for XBOX 360 owners. Don't bother with this POS!!Shame on you EA Sports....offer up the worst golf game ever just to be on XBOX 360 console and cash in. I feel cheated !!
5,Great Everything!,"I just got my xbox 360 a week ago and I got Tiger Woods 1 day ago and let me tell you it is worth the price! You get to hit people and play golf. My dad says, ""This is exactly how a play in real life!"" He got a Triple Boggey. The graphics on the game are amazing. I have never played a Tiger Woods game in my life now I wish I were Tiger Woods. It has all of Tiger Wood's emotions. Way to go Tiger Woods and EA Games."
4,not as good as the old ones,"This game is pretty good, but there are some things that aren't as good as the old ones. One thing being is that the only single player thing you can do is the PGA tour. Where is traveling around the world and playing some very weird but cool peaople. Where are the crazy coarses. What about playing the legends. Even without all of those things the game is still pretty good. The live play is fun if you find someone that will actually talk to you. It is also fun to play with a friend at home. Also if you make a bad shot and hit one of the peaople they either fall down or stagger around. it is pretty funney. but one of the things a can't get passed is the graphics. they are barley better than the PS2 or XBOX versions. So it is up to you if you want to spend 10 extra bucks just for a little bit better graphics."
2,Make a golf game that will do the 360 justice,Whew! they got it out for xbox 360 release date I think the graphics where as good on the TW 2004 C'mon EA there aint nothin special about this game even in HD save your money.
2,junk,this is the first golf game on the 360 and it shows. unachievable achievements meaning there not unlockable not very fun.
4,Nice positive Swedish Rock,"Some people would call Mikael Erlandsson hard rock, but I would put him more in a pop/rock with guitar category. As with a lot of Swedish rock, its up beat with catchy hooks, not too complicated, and easy to listen too.""Out of Champagne"" is a great song. The intensity of ""Stop (Following Me)"" is a testament to Mikael's vocal power. ""This is Your Life"" and ""Million Dollar Girl"" are sweet toe tappers."
3,Not a bad album,"I've been a fan of Fool's Garden since ""Lemon Tree"" came out in 1996, and for that reason got this album. It's not bad, but lacks any real hits like ""Dish of the Day"" with ""Lemon Tree"" or even ""For Sale"" with ""Suzy"". It seems like the weakness of their albums is kind of a stumbling block for this group. However, this album is pleasant to listen to, and I still really like this group. :)"
4,An under appreciated band,If you like the Beatles and Oasis then you like Fool's Garden.Very Beatlesque music.
5,Love it,DJ Talyor is one of the DJ's that get less recognition than he deserves. This particular mix is one of the best from it's time and suggest everyone gets a copy of this album!
1,Please...,"If I have to see Suze Schmooz about or take the credit for one more product she did not develope or one more art technique she did not originate, I think I will be sick. Give it a rest Suze."
3,a so-so technique book,"This book could have greatly benefitted from the proper crediting of images used and indication of the paper artist providing the examples. Anyone wishing to find the source of a given image used will be frustrated. Although there is a listing of stamp companies with a summary of the pages showing their images, it's impossible to determine which company provided which image on a given page showing multiple stamps. FRUSTRATING. The techniques illustrated are mostly old, well-known processes which any paper artist well versed in the current 'stuff' will be familiar with and many of the tricks to success with these techniques are omitted. A cursory summary at best for most techniques with sketchy documentation. I did get a couple new ideas but could easily have passed on this book if I'd seen a copy before ordering. I highly recommend that those interested in this type of paper arts book consider the three marvelous books by Mary Jo McGraw instead."
1,Cheaply Built. Don't recommend it,"Going to purchase the JL Clean Sweep, i had no idea the quality of the wires were so thin, a little pull/tug here and there ripped the wires apart. Had to removing the casing so I can replace the cheap thin wires with thicker speaker wires and solder. I decided to give up on this and purchase else where.This does it's job if your careful, but if you are looking for high quality, look elsewhere."
4,pretty good,very durable and water resistant. They don't fit like factory but with a couple of bungee cords they fit great.
5,John Denver's Windsong album,"I grew up with John's wonderful uplifting music. He is so very greatly missed! Windsong along with Spirit and Back Home Again, are my very favorites. A person can easily imagine flying like an eagle way over the mountains which John loved so much as well as flying. Success caused problems with his personal life, as it so often does with celebrities, but as far as music and singing, it never wavered. He was always on key and sang with the heart. His song Spirit is very moving as well as I'm Sorry. He loved to fly so very much and this can definitely be felt listening to this album. I highly recommend it."
2,"Poor Remastering, Shame on BMG!!!","Don't get it wrong. Two stars are given to reflect the poor digital remastering of this album. Windsong is actually my all-time favorite John Denver album and deserves more than 5 stars!!!!! If you are a die-hard John Denver fan like me, get the K24 bit remastering CD (now out-of-print, but vendors on Amazon's marketplace are still selling some of the rare copies, also read my other review for the Japanese Pressing of this CD on Amazon)."
5,Fun to Have Again.,"Had this as an LP when I was younger. Was happy to have it again, sang along with it. Fun, especially Two Shots, got No Ducks."
3,no pictures,"I bought this for $10 as an experiment to see if I liked the format and have reservations about whether I would do it again. The text appears to be clean and re-typed and it is given a nice paperback binding, but there are no images at all. For this particular book, it isn't too bad because there weren't many images anyway. But still, for a historic book, the pictures would have been nice. If you want the pictures and the original appearance of the text (which I thought I would be getting), you can download it free off of the internet, with a little searching, and have it bound at your local copy shop."
4,Interesting interdisciplinary discussion on negative emotions,"An interesting cross disciplinary discussion of afflictive emotions and ""negative mental states"" between buddhists and scientists. Not a ""how to"" but a work that puts in perspective what is a negative state of mind."
5,Great book!,I have only read a few pages of this book so far because I ordered three books and even before I bought them I'd decided to read Emotional Intelligence first. More later!
2,Lost in thought,"I LOVED the introduction of this book--it really challenged me to think about how the mind works, and taught me things about how the brain localizes emotions. So far so good. Then the good part...or so I thought. Rather than a synthesis of the profound ideas of his Holiness the Dalai Lama, instead I was ""treated"" to a blow-by-blow of how the meetings with him were set up, how ""special"" Mr. Goleman is to have had such influence. I could barely make it though the first in the series of seminars when I gave up. Maybe there was more there, but I didn't make it far enough to find out. And I blame the author and editors. I don't know who would enjoy this book. Goleman should have stopped at the introduction."
3,What about our own Judeo-Christian tradition?,"Upon skimming this book and reading some reviews of it, why do so many of these books on emotions have to draw only on the Eastern religions/philosophies? With all due respect to these, as well as to the various human sciences, I just wish the author of ""Destructive Emotions"" had drawn on some religious leaders from our own Judeo-Christian tradition -- (unless I am mistaken) why did the meeting with the Dalai Lama not include a rabbi, a Catholic priest, and a Protestant minister in addition to the Buddhists, philosophers, and experts in the human sciences?Mr. Goleman, please, enough of New Age -- let's have a modern rendition from you (and other authors in this field) of our thousands-of-years-old Judeo-Christian tradition to draw on!"
2,Disappointed,"I purchased this kit thinking I was getting what's on the picture and description. Unfortunately the tripod is junk, seriously it's dollar store quality, and it's not what the brand or type as pictured. The tripod wont hold up my Canon XT with the regular kit lens, this tripod is suited for a lightweight point and shoot. USELESS.The brand on the picture is Opteka and the brand I received is Digital Concepts. The one on the picture seems to be the kind that has bendable legs, the one I received does NOT.The cleaning kit is the same brand and by what I've seen from the tripod quality, DO NOT expect much, again Dollar Store quality.I'm very disappointed because I was expecting something decent and I would of glad fully spent the extra money to receive usable items. The whole reason this kit caught my attention was the tripod and OMG its JUNK!IMO, purchase separately and save yourself the disappointment!!!"
1,Vendor does not deliver,"This vendor has yet to fulfill the order. After waiting for at least two weeks the polarizing filter was sent, but I still have not received the UV filter. I will NEVER buy from 47th street photo again!!!!!"
2,Simple and Hopefully Effective,"I have had two children to a previous marriage and therefore I think I know it all. That's a guy for you. So when I spied this I thought it would be good for my wife and I to read in order to assist us with a 00ties (nauties, 2000's) child. She is 6 going on 26.The book is very easy reading, perhaps a little too easy and you need to get into it a fair way before the ""How to"" starts. Personally I am not religious and found the "".. Step 6 - Follow the Scriptures.."" a cop out.Anyway a good light book that gave me a couple of good tips like use ""would you"" instead of ""could you"" in a sentence. After all you are asking the child to actually do something not 'if' they can do it."
3,Scent Over Bearing!,This cream smells so strongly of spearmint that I used it only once and then switched to other products because I found the scent overpowering.
1,Tastes like Cinnamon grape nuts - $12 for about 2 cups,Service was great but product was not. Ended up costing me something like $12 for 2 cups and tasted like cinnamon flavored grape nuts cereal. Won't be buying this again.
4,Dixie Carb Counter Granola,"I liked the fact that Dixie Carb Counter Sweet Commute Carb Controlled Maple Oat Granola has no artificial sweeteners. The carb control granola helps me control my glucose numbers and allows me something sweet to eat as a snack. This product is not chunky so you can add this to yogurt, cereal, or toppings to ice cream.I liked the sweetness level even though apple flavoring from the low glycemic fruit juice dominated the maple flavoring. I was expecting more finger food or larger chunks but the smaller size works well for adding to yogurt. I sometimes combine this with my morning bowl of fiber cereal to give it sweetness rather than using artificial sweeteners.Price is comparable for the size package."
4,"Not as stated is not 3/8"" but is in fact 5/8""","I really wanted the narrower one as was stated in the description. It is a nice harness, else I would have rated it less. It is just not as narrow as it was described and feels bulky on my dog as she is also small, as I believe the other review felt the same way."
3,Honestly? The title is misleading.,"Well, I bought this little jewel thinking from the title suggestion that it was all overdubs of Jim & Patsy together. The back label makes no mention that it isn't-it's only when you start delving into the CD that you find out it's not all duet stuff. So, the title is really misleading, but the music itself is great. Problem is, not all Jim Reeves fans are going to be Patsy Cline fans and vice versa and dedicated fans of either one are going to have just about everything on here already. Really, a senseless compilation."
5,Honest seller,"The purchase arrived even faster than I was quoted and in excellent condition. My son will testify to that as I play it all the time,(LOUD) Great seller would not hesitate to do business with again"
1,Bad idea,This recording does a disservice to both artists. Bad concept which yields much less than the sum total of two great musicians.
2,Not for web designers,"I was quite disappointed with this book. I expected something much more advanced and technical. This is a DIY guide for the small business owner that wants to create a Wisywyg website. It's not real helpful for designers. And I have to say that I find the authors comment on the cover ""One billion? Two billion? Five billion? I'm still trying to figure out how many dollars have been wasted by Web site creators who lacked the information in this book"" extremely arrogant and irritating."
3,Web Production for Beginners,"This book is nothing for professional users, but the way it lays out the production stage and shows how to make a complete site it can be a welcome tool for beginners. Today, March 98, this book is too simple. It doesn't take into account new technologies and has a real simple view of web design."
5,Joe Stump's best songwriting effort,"I've purchased every disc by Joe, but none of them hold up as well as ""Second Coming."" There's no filler - all the tracks are catchy, hooky, and emotive. The production is good, and it just makes you want to crank up your car stereo and roll down the windows. ""You Turn My World Around"" is one of the finest rock tracks by any band, I think. All three (so far) ""Reign of Terror"" discs are good, but this one stands out as one fine slab of Americanized Euro-metal songwriting."
4,Fun - but that battery...,"My 5 year old got this for CHristmas, and we all play with it! It is hard to control - but that is part of the fun. It is amazingly durable - we have crashed it over and over with no problems. The lack of control is too uch fun. I can't wait to try it out on snow and ice! The bad part is the battery. I read some reviews about how the battery lasts for an hour??? No way. We charge it for 5 hours and get 10-15 minutes of play time. That's a pain!"
2,10 minute toy,"this thing is pretty hard to control. The surface the toy is on needs to be very smooth for it to work. Our street is too rough. we didn't bother with the pool and the battery went dead right away. it's a flop, but i think it was only $20."
3,"Good on land, but not what I expected on water","Goes great on flat surfaces, but doesn't move on water like I had expected. When moving across water, it's not on a cushion of air. It basically has tires that are mounted sideways. These tires spin in the water, and make the craft move. It's not ""floating"" over the water. It's like a really slow boat in the water."
3,Ideal conditions toy,"Seems to work ok. The battery life seemed to last just long enough. Operation was tricky - hard to control - not much fun inside the house. We've only had it outside once on hard packed snow. Where it was level and smooth, the hovercraft really flew - it was a blast. Judging from the little experience we've had with it, I don't think it would be much fun on water or uneven terrain. The dead weight of the inactive front wheel seemed to cause control problems. Sometimes it was more fun to drive it backwards. Overall, don't make this the crown jewel if you're gift giving."
4,My son's favorite Christmas present!!,"My absolutely loved this r/c vehicle. My only problem it did not work like it should through water, well as far as my son stated. It was a great buy and it included the battery with the charger. GREAT FIND!! Thank you!!"
2,Questionable playing; bad recording,"Richter wasn't at his best here, as shown in this recording of the Liszt Sonata, which is rushed from A till Z and has a blurred coda. He plays the Chopin Ballade well, and the Schubert Sonata is also quite interesting, although he is again a bit too enthousiastic in the last movement. the sound is the worst problem though. The Schubert is still acceptable, but the Liszt sounds almost entirely dried-up and hollow while the Chopin seems to have been recorded inside an aquarium. A very bad pirate issue."
2,A Little Disappointing,"i was expecting a live experience featuring songs from ""Set Me Free"" and the new project with a look at Myron Butler and his group and the reason behind the name Levi. the live session was taken from a Gospel Music Channel special which featured Myron and company perform live in front of an audience of 7 people. the material was good but the lack of audience participation.... well the lack of an audience period was really noticeable and a bit annoying. the bonus features do have an in depth and comedic look at the origins of the group but does not serve to outweigh the disappointment of the meat of the DVD: the live concert itself.i would recommend just purchasing his CDs, catching him at a concert near you and waiting for them to release a live recording."
5,sensuous,"I've had this cd since it came out. Ironically I wasn't even familiar with this artist. What attracted me to it was the cover and I guess the title since I was looking for something erotic yet ambient. I took a big chance because I wasn't able to return it after it was open. I have never been more pleased with a music purchase as I was with this particular album. In fact I still am, it is one of my most favorite cds and it always will be. If you like ambient music with a touch of Middle Eastern flare accompanied with an erotic, and sensuous voice you must get this album. You won't regret it."
3,Green Milk From The Planet Orange - 'City Calls Revolution' (Beta-lactam),"Recently caught this Japanese space-noise rock trio while out on their U.S. tour of small clubs. GMFTPO fuse together psych, rock, jazz and progressive. An okay band, but believe me, they're certainly NO Acid Mothers Temple, by any means. Four tracks here, ""Concrete City Breakdown"" (19:55), the insane & noisy ""OMGS"" (7:06), ""Demagog"" (8:22) and the ambient-turns heavy rock ""A Day In The Orange Planet"" (38:09) with plenty of high-pitch vocals. Line-up: Dead K - guitar & vocals, Benjian - bass and A - drums & vocals. One strange comparison I've heard was they're a bit like maybe Devo-meets-Cream. Spoke to all three members and they told me themselves their major influences are King Crimson, Pink Floyd and Hendrix. Check it out for yourself."
2,Cheap construction,"I mostly used as normal headphones. They really did not cancel out airplane noise. They are built with such cheap materials that they have broken twice with normal use in under a year. The first time they were under warranty and replaced, but now it is a loss. Save yourself the hassle and buy a brand that costs more but will last."
2,More Noise ADDITION than cancellation!,"I asked for, and received, these for Christmas. I tried them without the noise canceling feature enabled. They are closed-ear and do reduce ambient noise from the environment (about the same as any other closed-ear phones). I was very disappointed to find that when I turned on the noise cancellation, it actually INTRODUCED MORE noise. They apparently have poorly designed amplification circuitry and there is a signficant amount of hiss when the noise cancellation is turned on. I have not yet evaluated their ability to cancel low frequency sounds (like road and aircraft noise) but the high frequency hiss makes them unacceptable for listening to music with this feature turned on.Bottom line: they are a little pricey for use as low end closed-ear headphones, which is their only suitability. Buy a pair of Sennheiser HD201's or HD202's for this purpose at half the price. If you want noise cancellation, buy something else."
1,Horrible!,"The sound is mediocre to subpar and the fit is painful. The noise cancelation depends on a skull-crushing fit to be effective. I got these as a gift and I'm certain I wouldn't have purchased them on my own (without random and extremely manipulative council or, winning them with a 28% interest credit card).The AAA battery-powered noise cancellation is a pain in the arse because it is easy to leave it switched on after you take them off. Thus, going through batteries quickly. There is a red LED incicator light but, it is on the right speaker/driver shell and still easy for this dumb bell to notice it on. If the batteries are weak, the sound gets really crappy with extreme bass distortion. Also, after about 10 mins of play (with even new batteries), volume loss is apparent.This isn't ideal for sports activities so I do not understand why there is such a short cable lead of only about 3 feet(??).All-in-all, kinda crappy.-Cooked (pronounced like ""crooked"")"
3,eh..,i just bought these at radio shack for $50. the fit is ok but they pinch a bit after a while. the sound is pretty dissapointing. the noise cancellation feature doesn't do a lot and they sound quite muddy. the only thing i do like about them is their size. i will probably return them.
2,Waste of time,"While these headphones sounded decent to me, they became too much of a headache after a couple months.The plastic >:( part that holds one of the speakers to the headstrap broke I guess because I pulled them too far apart to fit over my head...Koss replaced them, and the same exact thing happened a month later and it was a brand new pair. I found a piece of metal to brace the crack so it would stay straight and that has worked fine. Apparently they cheaped out on a very important part here.And last night, they just stopped working all together. I tried them on different music players with no success.Save yourself the annoyance that I went through with these headphones. Oh and I never even bothered with the noise cancellation feature. It just sounded odd when in use."
1,EPIC FAILURE!,WOW! These remind me of something you would get in a box of cereal as a prize. Immediate out of the box PAIN! Smashes your ears to your head. Foam around the ears is just for show. Had to read the paper insert to find out where the batteries went. You have to twist the earpiece to get to the battery compartment. This process looks like it could tear the super thin fabric on the first try... Cord is too short. Had to put the volume on my TV to 30 just to hear it (normally use 6 - 8). The real kicker is when you turn on the switch. It actually MAKES airplane noise!
2,Get something else,I have a pair of these. The sound cancelation feature is poor. It does introduce more hiss when it's on than when it's off. It is easy to leave the noise cancelation on and not realize it when the headphones aren't in use. Sound quality is just ok. The cord is too short. Overall I'm really not happy with them. I only wish I had bought a pair of Pro4 AA's. I'm really kicking myself for not getting the Pro4's.
1,Skip the QZ-Pros and Buy Something Better,"I've had the Koss QZ-Pro headphones for several years and cannot recommend them to anyone. The noise cancellation is marginal at best and when turned on the noise cancellation introduces lots of annoying hiss.My wife has a pair of Direct Sound Extreme Isolation EX-29s which although they cost more, are far superior to the QZ-Pro. The EX-29s are passive so they do not require batteries plus they block all outside noises, not just the low rumbling noises.I recommend skipping the QZ-Pros and spending a little more to get a decent pair of noise cancelling headphones."
3,Let's not get too excited,"Hyperbolic remarks about this book will mislead you into thinking that this book is absolutely unique, when it's not. The material here is standard and present on many, many algorithms and data structures book.Furthermore, this book is dated, as it uses Pascal. It has very little relevance for today's world of collections of data structures made by experts (on Java, C#, Eiffel, Smalltlak, etc.) which are resources you need to know how to tap into to be more productive.And as a last point, algorithm analysis is not the strong point of this book either, as it is just a late chapeter in the book and gets nowhere near advanced (i.e., real) algorithmic analysis (for which you will need higher math, such as calculus and probability).Nevertheless, it's a good book but I don't know if you should buy it instead of that other, nice and new book using Java 5.0 using generics."
3,Unlikely Hero,Paul Conrad has been protecting the American public's First Amendment rights for over 30 years. As the editorial cartoonist for the Los Angeles Times he has made us laugh and think about the American political scene and 11 Presidents.This bio documentary by PBS is extremely informative and well made. Narrated by Tom Brokow it covers Conrad's career from the time of his graduation from college until his most recent free lance cartoons ribbing the Bush Administration.The film gives us a unique portrait of a man with moral convictions who stands up for his beliefs no matter what the cost. You may not know very much about Conrad but see this short film and learn. Conrad is truly one of a kind.
2,"Good music, poor remastering job","I really enjoy the music, but the sound quality stinks from an audiophile perspective. I have the original LP which blows this away. I find the sound edgy and grainy in the vocals; just a lousy digital transfer. This is fine to listen to in a car or a boom box. I can't listen to this CD on a high performance system. Enjoyable music. Mediocre sound. UGHHHHHHHHH"
5,Old glories (but what matters?),"This CD has amazing tracks, and take care........there are many tracks that are ""hidden"", I mean for example ""Spider formation""is taken from AX-009 B2, (the last track in the FUMIYA TANAKA MIX UP 4, Sonic music japan 1996, buy it too, now!!!) ""Humana"" is ""GROWTH B2"", so don't worry If you don't know about the titles, because they are old marvellous and amazing glories.Long live Jeff mills!by the way, have in consideration, I'm in the trance scene)but this guy comes from heaven to make us hear its lullabies. Regards"
5,Discontinued??,"I love this gel but have been unable to find it in any stores. I have been buying it online through Amazon for a while and now even Amazon doesn't seem to carry it. Has anyone found it somewhere else? Has it been discontinued? What other gels would you suggest for thick, curly hair?"
5,great diaper,"I bought this as an overnight diaper for my 3 1/2-year-old (cheaper than buying disposables all the time). It fits him very well and he tells me it's extremely comfortable, more so than disposables. With just one birdseye cotton diaper in the pocket, he woke up in the morning with no leaks! The velcro really makes for the perfect fit. And it washes well and dries quickly (I drip-dry everything, so I don't know how it would hold up in a dryer)."
2,Jive Bunny The Album This Ain't!,"After purchasing the Jive Bunny The Album I thought this would be a great addition to my collection, however I was sorely mistaken. It does carry a lot of good 70's tunes, but it just doesn't mix like ""The Album"". Stick to the ""The Album"", which scores big at clubs, party's, anywhere and forget this mix."
5,A good set of measuring spoons,not much to say about them other than they work. The only con is the little ring they are on isn't stainless steel so its starting to rust
3,MEH FIFA Game. SORRY to break it to you.,"Who doesn't love a good soccer game? Everyone loves a good one. The problem is this. EA has made a soccer game that is only mildly prettier than last years game, and has dropped many of the great features of the last game. However, if you need a soccer game for your XBOX 360 this is the only option you have. It is a decent game, just not as good as the last one. The crowd is ugly, the players are beautiful. There are not as many teams. Just do yourself a favor and buy last years to play it on your xbox 360. Sorry for the bad news."
1,Wrong description,"The game did NOT have 20 leagues, they don't have any league.No carreer modeFifa 2005 is still the best soccer game.Do not worth the priceIt has like 25% of the total features of fifa 2005What's wrong with eaSports?"
3,Wrong description Amazon,"This game is Fifa 2006 Road to World Cup and is similar to Fifa 2002 Road to World Cup in that it is a mini game release that EA has been doing recently. Its just about the World Cup so there are no Leagues or career mode only the World Cup play mode. Amazon's description is for Fifa Soccer 2006 (PC & PS2) that game has 10000+ player and 20+ leagues and a 15 year career mode. That being said, this game is not worth $60 and as with 2002 RTWC it will probably cost alot less after the world cup is over in July"
3,Play World Cup Germany its alot Better!,Maybe i suck at this game but i find World cup Germany to leaps and bounds better. FIFA 06 game play is ok but i think the players on the field are idiots and they all stand five feet from me and it makes it easy for the other team to steal the ball. I have not played alot of soccer in my time but even i know not to get a bunched up. But then again it could be because i dont now how to work my offense.Over all I'd say dont buy this game just buy World cup Germany or save your money till next year version and hopefully it will be better!
1,A total Rip Off!,"You are better off buying Fifa World Cup 2006...The accual World cup soccor game. I made the mistake of buying Road to the world cup. You don't play in the world cup on this one!! Also you dont get the new jerseys for the teams. Once I realized I had the wrong game I immediately retuned Road to the world cup. I bought Fifa World Cup 2006, and the game is awesome! New jerseys and the Cutscenes are astounding. Refs are just as hard as the ones in the real world cup. It adds to the realism. Playing the game with friends always is fun too. (especially on a plasma!) All in all, Im telling you that the Fifa World Cup 2006 is your best bet. Not Road to the world cup. Dont make the mistake I did and get them confused."
1,Horrible vendor!,Do not use Focus Electronics as your vendor for kitchen products because they do not stock items (get from Kitchenaid) and do not have knowledge of kitchen products!I ordered this item and got KN25WPBH. I contacted them regarding the issue and asked to have the correct item number sent and they replied that they were contacting the Kitchenaid sales rep to find out the correct item number! I did not ask them to inquire about the correct item number because I already did my research and ordered the correct item number! Duh ...Now they are closed for three days and I am stuck with a product I cannot use which I needed right away.This is the worse vendor experience I have ever had.
1,Poor Illustrations,"I was extremely excited to receive this book and overwhelmingly disappointed upon receipt. ALL of the photos in the book, demonstrating the techniques described by the author, are faded, grainey, black and white pictures. They are too faded, in fact, to even make out what the author is attempting to show. Without the pictures, the written instructions can be very confusing to follow. Definitely not worth the price paid..."
4,a long wait for me...,"i've wanted this cd for a long time but when ever i went to a buy it they didnt have it on stock..... so here i was a growing fan of G&D and without this cd, finally i got it and all i can say is wow. i think their originals are quite good and their remixes are some of the best in electronic music. so i find great their songs here (individual, together or colaborations) where i feel a bit let down is with the songs from other people. a few of them dont really seem rigth to me but thats only a very minor problem. i'd give it a 4.5 . hopefully i'll be able to see them live soon."
5,very consistent,"This is well worth it for anyone into progressive house (Sasha and Digweed, Dave Seaman, etc). A 2-CD set that can be just as easily listened to as danced to. I'm not big on dance music cover songs, so Andain's ""Here Is The House"" was the lowpoint for me (a Depeche Mode album track from ""Black Celebration""). Otherwise, a very satisfying mix."
4,Masters of the Throb,"This disk was my introduction to Gabriel & Dresden, and it's a solid piece with some catchy tracks. G&D;'s dark, throbbing style is very apparent on all songs in this two disk album, andMy heart really belongs to melodic trance, and so this was more an extracurricular purchase for me, to round out the music collection a bit more. Despite some trance-like undertones, this is more of a progressive house outing. Generally, the heavier mixing limits my listening to shorter stints, or encourages me to mix one of the two disks with a variety of other music. This isn't to suggest any shortcoming of G&D;, it's just more of a reflection on my preference in electronic music. I prefer a more varied texture and mood from one track to the next.This is, overall, a solid addition to the collection of anyone fond of electronic music."
4,Awesome journey,"This isn't my first introduction to Gabriel and Dresden, as I bought Gabriel and Dresden first, but Bloom has a lot to offer. I know a mix is good when I get lost in it, and I got lost immediately leading myself on a musical journey. All I got to say is Arcadia rocks plus it has Andain and Above and Beyond. A must buy!"
3,A little disappointing,"I had very high hopes for this CD, & they weren't met. I've enjoyed listening to G & D's recorded sets on Internet radio, & was super excited to get this. I heard some solid tracks (the remix of World on Fire, ""NoOne on Earth"", ""Alive"" are definite standouts) but no overall mood or flow. More a show of their producing skills than their DJ-ing. Again, disappointing, because I've heard their EXCELLENT mixing.Considering that ""As the Rush Comes"" was their breakout hit, I found it stingy of them to only mix in 30 seconds of a capella. Maybe G & D thought the track was over-played.Worth buying for the individual tracks."
2,BIG Disappointment,"Having heard these guys once play a pretty good set live and hearing some mixes that were pretty descent, I was expecting too much.Disc 1 which didn't have any mixes by them was OK, not anything fantastic and no tracks that really stood out, but somewhat listenable.Disc 2 however was mostly crap. I think they were trying to push to many of their own tracks and they just weren't good.But having heard them some other live sets from them that weren't very good, I've come to the conclusion that they're just plain boring as DJs. They came out with a few good mixes and that was it."
1,Sooo Boring!!,"Not what I was expecting from these guys, at all! They're supposed to be great, well, not on this cd. In some parts this cd to me sounded like some type of old house cd. Very Very dissapointing stuff. I hope they're way better when they play live, or the crowd just will go to sleep right there on the dance floor."
4,Great Gift!,"I have been cooking for many years and looking through this book is like looking at recipes it took me years to collect. I even discovered some that I didn't have, so was thrilled. The perfect gift for the new bride or even for someone like me to have all these fast and easy recipes in one book. I eat low carb these days but found many recipes in here that I can easily adapt. Of course I will be making many of these just as they are for my non low carbing family. Thanks for a great book. Diana Lee"
2,hmmm...pass,"This is merely a book of cut and pastes from speeches, bio's, autobiographies. From that, it is a dissappointment, but the title does state that that is what it is about. On the plus side, there are chapters of leaders that generally does not have a chance to read about.Common theme of leadership: look out for your subordinates best interest, maintain communication, live and act in the way that you preach and some other themes."""
5,RED 101 DVD,"I recommend this DVD highly for anyone seeking an overview of the RED One camera, how it works, ideas for camera setups, styles of use, etc. In my opinion this DVD is much better than getting a book about RED. The DVD is entertaining, informative, and has good production values. Whether you're a longtime pro seeking to get up to speed on RED One, or a a new working in the industry, this DVD will fast-track your learning curve. Steve Gibby, longtime owner of multiple REd One cameras."
5,Red101 DVD a Must Have,"I purchased this product and walked away from it knowing, not only more about the Red camera, but about other third party products that I can use with the camera that I didn't know existed (i.e vector scopes, element technica products, Cool lights products, and many many more). You won't regret owning this DVD."
2,Unbalanced,"A very biased book (at least he admits it). What is good about it? The depiction of life as an illegal immigrant and how immigrants help the American economy. What is flawed? Much more than I am willing to write here. The statistics he uses--conveniently picks and chooses to support his argument. His statistics don't paint the full picture. He doesn't distinguish between legal and illegal immigration. He seems to find no problem with illegal immigration--that's what really bothers people. He believes that it's Mexicans that Americans dislike. It's not Mexicans, it's illegals! All he does seem to do is whine about what is not right. He states there is no way to fix it and suggests that since it can't be fixed, to open our borders fully. There is no advocation about increasing the number of work permits or any cracking down on people who hire the illegals. Not much thought went into providing solutions. Anyone can criticize, but the good ones come up with solutions."
4,"Good book, but at this point a little dated","I think overall Ramos does an excellent job in this book. He candidly and honestly portrays the variety of experiences of Hispanic Immigrants. He has a great appreciation of the wide variety of cultures that fall under the title of Hispanic, as well as the particular challenges faced by each of them in America. In all honesty I could have done without his ode to Spanglish, as well as one or two other chapters, but overall I think this is a worthwhile read. The only other thing, at it may have already happened is that it needs to be updated!"
4,It's your choice!,"I, too, was curious about Ramtha after seeing ""What the Bleep?"" Despite the criticism posted here, I bought this DVD. I'm glad I did. I liked it! Look, if you're intrigued or curious about Ramtha's theories, spring for the DVD! If you don't like Ramtha-- buy something else that makes you happy! It's really that simple."
4,A must for young Indian students,This book should be required for all young Indian students interested in preserving tribal rights and customs. It is a quick and easy to read reference for class and personal use. Anyone (including non-Indians) interested in learning about tribal reserved treaty rights needs to read this book.
4,Good Start,"I'm new to the Peter Bernstein fan club, and I want to enjoy his work chronologically, so here I start. This is a very good album. The influences of Grant Green and Kenny Burrell are on full display. Mr. Bernstein's playing is tasteful, self assured, and mature. It burns,indeed, when it is called for, cools down and mellows out on the tune Afterglow, and always swings. Brad Melhdau is outstanding on piano. I plan to seek out more of his work based on this album.Two quibbles keep me from awarding five stars: 1. The piano seems just slightly out of tune. 2. Jimmy Cobb's drums are too prominent, both in the mix and in performance. It's a guitar album, after all. Save the solos for a Jimmy Cobb album.I recommend Somethin's Burnin', quibbles and all. 'This could be the start of a beautiful friendship.'"
4,early Peter Bernstein,"Great hearing a young Peter with an equally young Brad Mehldau on piano. I have no idea how Peter gets such fantastic tone from an ES175! I wouldn't have thought it possible. Peter's rendition of ""Mr Kenyatta"" is worth the price of admission alone, one of my favorite old Lee Morgan tunes."
3,Pricey,"After purchasing this, I found 22oz packages at 1/3 of the price. Probably won't buy again due to this. BUT...the product itself was great, just overpriced."
5,Best glue I've ever used,"I started using this epoxy many years ago when building radio controlled model airplanes. I got out of the hobby, but kept using this product for many, many household repairs. It is easy to mix in very small quantities, hardens quickly, and is generally stronger than the materials it is holding together. It is much better than the typical glues you find at hardware stores. Highly recommended."
5,Very Pleased,"Have tried other epoxys in less demanding repairs than I used this product on and they did not do as well as this did. I repaired a spring loaded laptop computer hindge that had very little surface for glue to adhere to. One side of the monitor screen had completely broken away from the base, has held for a couple of weeks now with continual use."
3,Slow DVD-R speed limits this burner.,"The new technology to allow for the Lightscribe feature actually slows down this DVD burner! DVD-R speeds are limited to 8X. So, if speed is an issue, look to another burner without Lightscribe to get DVD-R at 16X. If Lightscribe is more important, then go with this one. But beware of what you're getting. I was disappointed to discover I had a crippled DVD burner for the sake of Lightscribe! I'm returning it."
3,Works but the technology is really slow.,This product works effectively and produces surprisingly professional results however you're going to be waiting a looooong time for those results. It takes a lot longer to burn a label than to burn the data.
3,works ok in general,"did not do as well as plextor. the plextor i have, which has firewire and usb not just firewire (though you can get the la cie with both), burned a dvd on an old computer while this one couldnt, tho i had to use 16x media to do it on the plextor. it may just be the roxio 7 program i have. i dont know. both worked about the same on a g4 apple.Since I wrote this, my Plextor no longer PLAYS Dvds, nor burns cds (though it does burn dvds). The La Cie still works in every respects."
3,Nice sports bra,"My bra size is 34DD, so I purchased the medium(34-36) thinking it would be big enough but it wasn't. If you are bustier, order the large or XL if available. Overall, a nice workout bra that holds and supports and retains moisture."
3,"A nicely made, comfortable sponge.","It's comfortable and supportive, and it looks nice, but... wow, it holds onto sweat like a sponge. I just took it off after a short bike ride, and it was soaked. My jersey, dry. The polyester liner on this sports bra, dry. The cotton blend that makes up the rest of the bra, soaked. If you value being dry, this might be a good sports bra if you're a model, posing next to sports equipment, in an air-conditioned environment. Maybe if you work out in a swimming pool, then it would be great."
3,how gud is the bra??,"Well, yes it gives good support but not good enough for running. Maybe i was looking for a tighter feel, hence i also bought a small instead of the usual medium, i wont say its bad but i wudve liked better support and tightness during my regular jog. Good for aerobics and gym i guess. Also,the material seems to be loosening out a bit already.. i just hope it lasts long to serve the purpose."
5,brilliant,"Quite simply, this is a book about the origin, development, and uses of corn.Explanations of the domestication of corn, the developmment of its varieties, and the ongoing farming of corn. It shows how corn has been modified into a staple grain world-wide. Great book. Not just for little kids."
5,THIS SCREENPLAY MUST BE PRODUCED!,"If produced as written, this would be (barring 2001) the greatest science fiction film ever made. Harlan Ellison has created a mature, thought-provoking, intelligent screenplay. I finished it today, on the anniversary of the Oklahoma City bombing, and the final words (and major theme of the story)--""are people basically good?""--haunted me long after I put it away. Only the greatest art can do that. This is a film that must be made."
1,"This ""Famous"" Screenplay is Terrible","The only reason to read this slog of a screenplay is to finally shut up the people who keep talking about how great it is. An awful episodic treatment of several of the weakest stories tied together with a plodding framing device, this script is truly a creative disaster."
5,Everything old is new again,"You might be disappointed if you were expecting the exact same thing as the original 1984 Optimus Prime toy (or wanted a trailer for the truck), but this is an updated version of the original character, as opposed to a remake, and is superior in many ways. It is durable, detailed, well-articulated, and fun, especially with the truck parts forming weapons for the robot. I'd recommend it for kids and nostalgic adults alike."
4,Voyager Class Optimus Prime,"Great Toy, Fantastic durabiliy. Articulation is awesome. If you could only get one I would definetly recommend this one its a must have"
3,"Didn't work for me, but I imagine in could be good for other uses","I purchased this product to color a metal ceiling fan. My hope was to match some lighting that I recently purchased. The problem I ran into with this product is that it did not adhere to the metal as well as I wanted. It actually turned into a very fragile top coat that when dried would flake off easily. I ended up using regular flat black paint. Perhaps it would have been best to coat the paint with an adhesive sealant after applying. Based on my experience, I am not so sure that this product is good for use on metal as the consistency is a bit thick. However, it does look like it would be good for paper, wood, fabric, and similar items like lamp shades. I would not plan to use the product on any item that you expect to see heavy use, like a door, appliance, or anything that gets touched frequently."
4,A Present,"There are so many influences running though this band, and they are all so expertly melded into one style, that it's hard to pin them down. By turns abrasive and highly melodic, The Decline of British Sea Power is a persuasive calling card. At the end of the day, they remind me more of the much missed The Wedding Present than anybody. But this CD is so good it doesn't make me run over to the cabinet and pull out Watusi."
5,An almost perfect album,"The latest band since Interpol to be compared to Joy Division. They wear military uniforms at their live shows and they sings about Czech history. Their live show tends to be quite exciting. They often walk into the audience and get them involved. They play live surrounded by a bunch of trees. They are not as dark as Joy Division. They are quite energetic and exciting. I think that it would be a hard act to follow. British Sea Power don't seem to have much to do with other bands right now. I don't know if it is that they do too much drugs or are too strange by birth. They go from pop singles to experimental noise and on this album some tracks go twelve minutes. ""Something Wicked"" is an example of great songwriting that goes beyond the limitations of Coldplay. All that seems old fashion anyway. An album as powerful and as complete as this one is, where can you go?"
1,Newly discovered lost Pixies album,"British Sea Power is the best Pixies tribute band I've ever heard. This album sounds like Doolittle if it had been produced by the members of Can. Which isn't to say it's not enjoyable, it's just not a new experience in the slightest if you've ever listened to a Pixies album."
5,Great CD...Go see them in person!,"Just saw their live show in Chicago and they exceeded all expectations...they brought the house down! The CD is fantastic through and through, but live, they're even better. They've got a bit of a New Order rhythm section feel to them but with a much heavier guitar sound. The guitars are loud in a good way but more sophisticated than, say Oasis. Buy the CD. If you have the opportunity to see them live, DO IT!"
3,Fetching formula,Sincere though limited indie still survives; it remains clear these guys had attended Pixies 101.
3,"Great, good, and irritating","Other reviewers accurately describe this CD as having a lot of variety. Of them, I agree most with 'justin ""storminheaven"" (north carolina)' who says ""The first of the album gets off to a shaky start.""Then he commends ""Standout tracks"" Fear of Drowning, Carrion, and Lately. I'd add that Fear of Drowning is a great song...if you buy this CD wanting more of the same, you're not going to get it. Still, one other song is decent (A Wooden Horse) so 4 good songs makes this a worthwhile purchase. The lead vocalist has a future.But overall you can't listen to this CD beginning-to-end without crappy opening tracks and the truly irritating Heavenly Waters at the end. Sometimes I wonder how musicians can practice and practice a song without realizing it's crap. So you can't just shove this CD in the car and drive, you've got to program the player, convert selections to MP3, etc."
4,Foot Care for immobile patient,"These comfort pillows have really done the job I expected. My 92 year old mother has been bedbound since Sept. 2008, and I use these pillows daily on her feet. They have really helped prevent skin breakdown on her heels. In the evening I use rolled fleece throw to keep her heels off the bed. Our Hospice nurse wanted to know where I purchased them. I shared that information with her, because I was very happy with the product. At first I thought they might be too firm, but they are working perfectly."
2,What the?,"This seems like a terrible promotional attempt. I loved Crowded House and I loved these albums. But what's going on here? For instance:-other than being in LP-esque sleeves rather than jewel cases, what else is different about these albums?-are the 3 LP-sleeves housed inside a hard-shell box, or cool slipcase?-do the albums feature remastered sound?-are there any bonus tracks? it doesn't even look like the first album has ""Can't Carry On"" like my cd copy does!If you're a newcomer to crowded house, get their ""Best of"" album (I think it's called ""Recurring Dream""). If you have that and are interested in further purchases, all of their individual albums are avialable at amazon for not much dough. Make sure ""Can't Carry On"" is on your copy of the first Crowded House album, it's an excellent song worthy of that excellent album. SKIP THIS BOXED SET."
2,Could Have Been 20 Pages or Less,"This book was filled with page after page of material taken from other trials that rambled on more than anything else. Sometimes it would go on for as much at 10 pages to make a point, which was a poor example at best. I would not recommend wasting one's money on this."
4,"Nice to play, good overall product","It's a nice replica toy for children. Good work with the full retractable blade, but not very shinny (the similar saber created before shines much more). a little big for kids, but fun to play with. my son loves it."
1,Would be awesome if it worked...,"This product, in concept, is amazing. However it did not last more than a couple extentions before the spring loaded blade bit the dust. My little guy was so excited about his lightsaber and very careful with it as well I might add. It just was not built to survive :( We saw it light up once, the sound never did work and now it will not extend so it's officially a gallactic flop with my little boy."
2,Built to Break,"My 3 boys (ages 4, 7 and 9) love their lightsabers so the idea of a spring activated version was too hard to pass up. Imagine the disappointment when the fragile spring/force action is only good for about 3 tries and then it falls apart with no way to get inside and fix it. We have 3 of them (Darth Vader, Obi-wan and Luke Skywalker). Vader was done before 9am Christmas morning. The other two are hanging on by a thread and now the boys have to be ""very gentle"" when they load the saber. The worst part is that the light up feature is tied to the spring so it does nothing now. These are not rough kids and it's just a matter of time before the other springs get jammed. Stick with the original light up sabers and forget the force action."
1,Customer service disaster,"DO NOT deal with Verizon Wireless unless you're willing to endure continuous calling if you try to close your account.Last week, shortly after telling Verizon's sales person I was switching to T-Mobile because their Customer Service is a disaster, I began getting three to five calls each day that hang up as soon as I answer. Doing a *69 revealed they were coming from 1-800-470-0768, Verizon Wireless' number. Calling a supervisor (Jasen) resulted in an apology and him putting me on their Do Not Call list, which he says won't take effect for 30 days. He also said this is a ""known problem with Verizon's auto-dialer"" for which Verizon has no solution. It's only noon and so far today I've gotten three calls from them, two hangups and another sales pitch to upgrade my phones and stay with Verizon Wireless.I'd rather stick needles in my eyes."
1,Problem with the seller,"I ordered this book December 25, 2008 and as of January 23, 2009 I still had not received it although the seller assured me that it had been shipped. Therefore, I cannot respond to whether I like the book.I must add that I also orderd the audio (CD) version of the book FROM A DIFFERENT SELLER which was shipped and received in a timely fashion. I enjoyed the audio version very much!!"
4,Nice Advice,"I read this from cover to cover over three connecting flights from Richmond, VA to Idaho. Miss Kitt provides basic advice, infuses it with her wit, and sprinkles various life experience ""skits"" into the mix. I enjoyed it very much and got more out of it than I realized at the time. Miss Kitt displays her intelligence and common sense when it comes to taking care of oneself. Take a look at her and you will see, now at age 80, she clearly knows what she is talking about."
2,It's OK But Not Enough,"I have admired Eartha Kitt for years and have always found her facinating when ever I've seen her performing or on a talk show.She is truly an amazing woman who has lived an extraordinary life and looks absolutely wonderful at her age. Her philosophical ramblings in this book merit consideration and we may learn from them. Still, the book is a rather meager serving and I wish that Ms. Kitt had included more practical advice and better photos."
5,TRAGIC,"I am amazed this film survived U.S., British and Israeli intelligence censorship. Evidently when pressure is applied to politicians they will give up their morals rather than give up their political careers. It's not uncommon for blame to flow downhill. Having served in the armed forces I am not amazed at what happened. Blind revenge seems to be the driving force for people's inhumanity to man and after 10,000 years of continuous religious war mankind has still not learned that this kind of thinking does not lead to world peace."
4,Bracing,"This documentary digs into the heart of world-wide practices on torture and imprisonment, but specifically addresses the death of an innocent taxi driver in Afghanistan who was tortured and killed by American soldiers. This film tells the story of what led up to Abu Ghraib, and it does not hold any details back. This story is not for the faint of heart, or for those who want their wars to be black and white. It is a worthwhile watch, not only to learn this man's story--which was the case with many who were imprisoned--but of those soldiers under orders to commit crimes and of the military that abandoned them when the secrets were found out."
5,Oh Yeah!,"How has no one reviewed this yet? Beautiful playing. Bill Charlaps rhythm section...Peter Bernstein in one of the only recorded situations of him playing in a guitar trio (when he's soloing)...and ofcourse the great Ralph Lalama. Man, this is nice don't think twice about it, click that button...this is world class."
5,Flaked Fish Food,"This particular fish food is the best in that it never, ever fogs water. The fish love it of course too! When purchasing the larger can it equals into a very practical purchase in that the cost is relatively less by ""more volume"" sized containers."
3,Not the same as the previous pictureback books from R.H.,"Back in 1993, 4, and leading up to 6, Random House published about 5 or 7 pictureback books from the Thomas series, from the era of Ringo Starr narrating. The main difference between those books and ""The Cranky Day"" is quite disappointing. ""The Cranky Day"" (which is even titled wrong. [Cranky Bugs]) is written straight from the vhs tape, as if the closed captioning was copied and pasted into a book. Nothing is explained, and I am not exaggerating. If you haven't seen any of these stories yet, you'll be very, VERY confused when you hear the dialect of an engine say ""LOOK OUT!"" or, ""DON'T MOVE"", then to see an image, of what might be happening, with no reasonable explaination given. There never is a sentence in the book saying: ""Percy had helped lift Cranky up with a rope, but foolishly forgot to detach it."" or something with reason. Overall, it's still an okay book. but I am disappointed that Random House copied straight from the tape...yuck!"
2,You'll be cranky!,"Please don't confuse this Read To Me series with other Thomas the Tank books. For instance, Catch me, Catch me is called a Pictureback Reader, and although it is meant for 4 or 5 year olds to learn how to read, my 21 month old loves it--the extremely simple text is all her attention span can take. The Cranky Day, however, has a lot of writing and is meant for the longer attention spans of 3 or 4 plus year olds. I don't like the tiny photos for pictures where the text takes up just as much room as the photos, and I agree with another reviewer that the photos are dark. The full page drawings in Catch Me Catch Me are much better, as are the simplistic drawings in Thomas the Tank Engines Big Blue Treasury. Depends upon the age of the child I guess, when it comes to selecting Thomas books!"
2,Story needs editing,"While my three year old son recognizes his favorite Thomas characters, this book is poorly written and edited. The first story, ""Cranky Bugs"" is especially annoying because little sensitivity was used to match the pictures with the text. It is bad enough that the text is taken straight from the video tape, but some editing would greatly improve the stories. How sad that the Britt Allcroft empire has reduced the original, wonderful stories from Rev. Awdry to such rubbish."
5,Me & my dad recommend this book`,Me & my dad read this book and it was very funny. Before we read it my dad said it would be it would be educational since I am only a 2nd grader. I recommend this book to anyone who thinks they would like to try this book.
5,hiero crew still wreckin releases,"This is a must for any hiero fan, which i have been since day one. A-plus comes raw with ill flows, dope beats, and true hip hop abilities. If your a hiero fan then you wont be disappointed i guarantee it. plus, when has the hiero crew ever let us hip hopers down? i cant think of any time. their legacy still rolls on....A-plus really pours a lot of feeling and thought into his rhymes...stop wastin time pick this ish up!""I drive with my knees when I'm rollin up my trees"""
3,Excellent Quality CD,"The CD is great, ther is no doubt about that. Quality excellent.Unfortunately the Cover was cracked at some point upon delivery. I guess this is common when CD's travel from USA to Australia. Anyhow, dope CD. . . Adam is the man!"
5,The South Gets Dirty Dirty,"I got interested in this because it was recorded by John Reis, of Hot Snakes fame, in Tijuana. I was happily surprised, like I am most times I visit Tijuana, and consequently this album hasn't left my turntable for about a year now. If you love rock and roll, this is what you've been waiting for. The ultimate party record."
4,Very solid study of Korean nationalism,"Very solid overview of Korean nationalism. The first half of the book argues that the development of a strong sense of ethnic nationalism in Korea was not inevitable, but rather a product of the historical interplay of competing ideologies (pan-Asianism, International Socialism, etc). The second half looks at a number of more particular issues (education, agrarianism, minjung, etc). The first half was outstanding - tight, persuasive and interesting. The second half was a bit more rambling, but at times quite interesting. A good place to start learning about Korean nationalism, though I imagine it would be easier going if you had some grounding in 20th century Korean history."
4,A true picture of how Louisiana operates.,"I should know; I grew up there. I agree with Florida, but I think the film was excellently cast, especially Michael Parks as the corrupt cop. Great accent and acting on his part. It may be a bit dated know, since it was made 15 years ago, but that movie is still the Louisiana I grew up in - and believe me, that is how politics still works there."
3,Holds one's attention,"Essentially the misadventures of a young man (Spader), acting rather stupidly, this mystery drama at least keeps one watching throughout its running time. It's a semi-thriller about a rich, southern young lawyer running for congress, attempting to uncover the web of deceit that has been spun around him by opponents unknown, following off from his father's death. Spader gives a terrific, ultra cool performance as the hotshot lawyer and is given strong support all round, notable from Jason Robards. Director Frost (who worked with David Lynch on the cult TV series, ""Twin Peaks"") keeps the plot moving along at a moderate pace, but one can't help but think it could have been better if the plot had revolved around something more substantial that Spader's whim."
3,This movie wasn't really great...,"I found this movie to be a little too drawn out and confusing, but James Spader did a fairly good job with his role (even though his more recent works are much better). One good thing about this film was the beautiful scenery, colors and lighting in many of the scenes. I just couldn't get into this movie...James Spader's acting abilities were just not at their best in this picture."
4,Under Appreciated Movie,"No. It is not Chinatown. Not even close, But this is a very entertaining movie that I have watched time and again. The cast is excellent, top to bottom and in my mind, it is James Spader's best performance.It has its flaws. But I've already said, it does not approach the perfection of Chinatown. But, if you are in the mood for some intrigue with fine acting and wonderful music all woven together, watch this movie."
4,Great music,"Why is Volume 3 now out of print? Volume 3 completes the awesome set of John Denver's radio versions of his greatest hits. I have all three volumes and the music is great and there's no reason to have Volume 3 out of print. ""Love Again"" and ""Autograph"" are great versions here. If you can find this album and are a John Denver fan, this is a must."
5,JD Greatest Hits Vol Three,"I consider this John Denver's best of all time. You can't top ""How Can I Leave You Again"" , ""Love Again"" ,""Seasons of the Heart"" and ""Autograph"". All of the rest of the tunes are gems as well and John's sounded strong and clear and true. It is a crime that the other two greatest hits albums are available and this one is not. Fans would buy it up at the store or on line if it was made available. What are the record companies thinking?"
4,My least favorite of the greatest hits volumes,"Anybody who loves John Denver will like this CD, but I have to say it's my least favorite of his greatest hits albums. It does have some great songs (How Can I Leave You Again, Shanghai Breezes, Perhaps Love), but it also has a few I was not familiar with, and they've never really grown on me. I usually reach for #1 or #2 first. I wish he was still here to release #4, #5..."
4,john denver,this cd is alittle slow but everything john denver sing is good there are some other cd that are probable better.
3,Expected solid not hollow,These hoops look as they were photographed. I have had earrings with the unusual stem shape before so they don't bother me at all. I have sensitive ears and the purity of the metal is just what I needed. No itching or irritation after a week of wearing them. They arrived nicely packaged and would make a nice gift. I was surprised however to find that these earrings are hollow. For the price I expected a solid metal with some weight behind it. The fact that they are hollow gives them a 'cheap' feel in your hand.
1,Post too big..OUCH,"These earrings are very pretty, but the post is WAY TOO THICK. They killed my ears and I had to return them. I would guess the post is at least 2.5 times as thick as a normal post, and my ears did not like it!!!"
2,Hurts my ears,"The actual prong that goes into your ear is not round but flat and oddly shaped, so whenever I put these earring in they hurt my ears. So I've only been able to wear them twice and the second time I had to take them out because they became so painful."
4,Bought them for a friend's birthday.,"I bought the earrings for a friend's birthday, I gave them to her just last Friday and she said she loves the earrings. So, I'm happy about that..."
4,My Girlfriend liked them...,"These were perfect, the girl liked them, they're the perfect size, not very expensive, great gift!"
4,white gold hoop earrings,"These earrings were just what I was looking for. They were impossible to find in a store, so I was delighted to locate them on Amazon."
4,Good product,"I was nervous when i bought these for my girlfriend however, they proved to be perfect. Good quality and they are not huge rings at all just small and cute."
5,Quality earrings for the price,"This was a pity gift to myself because it was my anniversary, and I've just had nose surgery. Like other reviewers, I was also surprised at the quality of these earrings. I try to look for bargains on Amazon to make my shopping dollars go as far as possible, and these seemed to be a good deal at $24.99 when regular price was $75. Just since March 16, though, both retail and selling prices have changed on Amazon to be $34.99 and $70. It's very true that the posts are a little thicker than normal, but not onerously so; the result is that the hoop is not going to slide around on your ear, and the post clicks securely into the catch on the other side. The earrings are larger than I expected for the price, which is good, but they are not too big. Nickel size is about right, and they feel as if they have some weight to them."
4,14k White Gold Hoop Earrings,"These are very nice, great for a basic pair of earrings. Very nice size and I believe these will be great for very day wear."
5,Sandford Is In Excellent Form,"Unlike some of the other authors who are well into a series, Sandford's writing has not slipped an inch. If anything, the Davenport series just keeps getting better. The storytelling is always great, the murderers are always unforgettably chilling and the dialogue and interaction between Davenport and his crew are always riveting and realistic. This is one great series, by a great author, and I hope he keeps writing these for a long time to come. I particularly liked this entry because it brought back more of the interaction between Davenport and Sloan and Del, which I particularly like, and because of the relationships between Davenport and Weather and Kidd and Sherill."
5,Consistently Good,"This is another successful thriller from the mind and pen of one of the most consistently good writers currently plying his craft.We, the readers, are introduced to the killer in the first chapter and are able to follow along as he meets his match with a potential victim who piques his curiosity and challenges his resolve to murder. The reader also is able to see how Lucas Davenport solves a case and interacts with law enforcement, family and friends in the midst of a chaotic personal life.As a graveyard of possible victims is uncovered, the tension and pressure to find the perp mounts and Lucas does what he does best, uncovers clues and interprets evidence to lead him to the inevitable confrontation. However, as usual Sandford is able to add the ingredients of human complexity and fraility to the climax which makes his novels stand above the rest and sends the reader to bed satisfied.Highly Recommended!"
2,They wear me out.,"I wonder if anyone else is tiring of the increasing coarseness and vulgarity of this series.This book is a sandstorm of profanities and obscenities. It's easy enough to dislike the bad guy, in this case, James Qatar, but unfortunately it's also getting easy to dislike Lucas Davenport and his crowd. I think I'm avoiding them the next time around. They wear me out."
3,Where oh where....,"is the Lucas we all know and love? Qatar was one of the worst villans I ever read in the Prey series. And, although I like ""Weather,"" this bit about him impregnating her was BORING! Hope the next one brings Davenport back WITH his edge!!!!!"
4,One of Sandford's Best,"Easy Prey, #11 in the series, was just not very good. With Chosen Prey, Sandford returns to what this series is all about - great characters, great plot, some heavy duty evil and serious twists and turns along the way. This is one of the best in the entire Prey Series and, while the ending becomes predictable towards the last few chapters, it is still a thrill ride. You can probably read any of the books as ""stand alones"" but reading them in order adds depth to the characters and story lines."
3,Same old story,"Let me begin by saying I am a fan of the Prey books. However, this one was old and tired. I was surprised that no mention was made to how Davenport got his fortune (it was made reference to with something like 'you have more money than god'). The Weather relationship should have become more of a story, or left out all together. I found myself looking forward to the hints about the next book, where Davenport may be at a higher ranking and can pick and choose his assignments."
2,Boring!,"Wow, what a letdown! After reading 'Certain Prey', my first Sandford novel, I was hopeful that I would be equally impressed with the other books in the Davenport series. Unfortunately, 'Chosen Prey' was nothing like 'Certain Prey'. Gone was the instant deluge into the world of a ruthless killer. Instead, we get a white bread and mayonnaise, ho-hum serial killer, with whom even Davenport even seems bored to death (no pun intended). Talk about your lackluster antagonists! I hope I didn't waste my money on the other Sandford novels I've purchased."
4,"Chosen One, Not This Time","Sanford, you are amazing, everytime I think I get it figured out, you throw me another curve ball. This was a very good story with a modern theme. Who would have thought to look at a college professor, in a catholic school? He had access to these beautiful women and he took that to the utmost advantage. It made me look closely at my surroundings. Glad this one didn't get away."
3,Cracking Wise Overshadows Development of Qatar,"This is one of those books where you're interest is grabbed immediately. Its also one which lets you down a little after the initial surge.James Qatar is a pathetic killer who finds his pleasure with his lawn mower cord, using it over and over to kill those he finds sexually attractive. This is established in the first few pages.After being introduced to this dismal character, the scene shifts to the Lucas Davenport and the many characters he interacts with.The book goes on, switching between the killer and the police. The ratio of coverage is about 80% police and 20% killer.If these percentages hovered closer to 50/50, the book would have been more interesting - though more morbid!"
2,Only works for true fans of the Prey series,"Lucas is still tough and smart but he never has a real confrontation in this one. Mostly talking about the weather and Weather, comparing lists and phone records, eating, driving cars, talking to snitches and the press......zzzzzz. He needs a fight or a shootout and some danger to raise the flatline thrill level of the last two entries."
3,I expect more from John Sandford,"I really enjoy the Prey series, and Sandford is one of my favorite writers. Having said that, I was terribly disappointed with this book. The premise was ok, but there were far too many 'empty' sections in the book where nothing happened for pages and pages. If anyone else wrote this book I would have given it only 2 stars. It gets 3 because Sandford's writing still draws you in somewhat. I hope the next one is better, but I will borrow it or get it from the library just in case it is not."
4,Chosen Prey,"Sandford is a master at his genre. His characters are strong, consistent and I always look forward to participating in their newest adventure. Perhaps that is the ingredient that holds me, each crime solved becomes a new and different adventure with Sandford'Kindle Fire, Full Color 7"" Multi-touch Display, Wi-Fis characters."
4,Pretty Good,"A very nice basic introduction to world war two. It is not comprehensive, but it covers the broad scope of events. It also has many pictures. I taught an introduction to world war two using this book as my primary resource."
2,"Pretentious, difficult to follow, pointless.","Very pretentious and artsy book, most of the events feel pointless and loosely connected at best. The artwork is interesting until you try to figure out what's going on at any given point. Personally I'd take Frank Miller or Jeph Loeb over Grant Morrison any day of the week - I like stories that are intriguing and unpredictable, but actually have a point. The one thing I did like was the portrayal of Two-Face, but I will never forgive Morrison for his unmotivated, unnecessary, gratuitous and disgustingly pretentious bloodletting scene. In my opinion, the most impressive thing an artist or writer can do is make something intriguing, original and deep while maintaining a clear and purposeful expression of thought or emotion.Doing dark or graphic things for no reason doesn't make you an artistic genius, it makes you annoying."
3,Great story + abstract art = Just OK,"Batman: Arkham Asylum is a fantastic story - Batman is forced to go through Arkham in a sick and twisted obstacle course setup by the Joker, on April Fool's day. At the same time, the book focuses on Arkham's slow decent into maddness, and parallels that decent into Batman's tenuous grip on sanity. That said, the art is very surreal and abstract, and it took me out of the story. It forced me to think about what I was looking at, but I think some of the details that the author and artist intended to portray were lost. Overall, I'd say it was good, but not great."
3,heavyhanded with the symbolism,"Despite the overwhelming bombardment of symbolism, textually and visually, the plot is surprisingly simple. The inmates of Arkham Asylum for the Criminally Insane lure Batman into their midst and instigate a dangerous game of hide-and-seek. Batman's inner fear that he is as insane as his hosts weakens his resolve, but he proves stronger than the madness within Arkham and its inmates. Flashbacks and journal entries by Arkham's founder are intertwined with Batman's descent into the hell of Arkham. When the graphic novel was released in the early nineties it was considered groundbreaking and a precursor to today's grittier, darker graphic novels and remains one of the highest selling grahic novels of all-time, according to it's creators. I can see why it won accolades, but confess I had to read the notes and full script included with the 15th anniversay edition to make sense of it."
5,Gorgeous piece of art,"One of the most gorgeous works of comic art I've ever read. I don't normally enjoy superhero comics, but I've always liked Batman. This one delivers the money shot - it's a dark, brooding psychological thriller and it's one of those books I'm very pleased to have on my shelf so I can occasionally flip through its glossy pages."
5,Awesome!,"This comic was awesome, it was very dark, just like the original Batman comics. Me and my boyfriend enjoyed it very much and cannot wait for the game or other comics to come out."
3,Abstract,I really liked the idea of the story but the illustrations were really abstract and didnt really feel like a comic book. It was still a good edition to my collection
2,Not the best..,"It wasn't all that great. The title is the same as the video game, so I thought that this was what the video game was based off of. When I opened the book and read the first few pages, it wasn't all that bad. As I got further into the book I quickly grew bored of it. The art was decent, except for batman. The curls on his cape kept bugging me. It's probably not important, but it's my way of saying the art is bad. Next is the dialogue. It's good, but the way it's written and coloured makes it almost unreadable. There is not much action, the book doesn't seem like batman at all. In my opinion, this book wasn't good."
3,Far from my favorite,"I have a vast collection of Batman graphic novels, and this is by far my least favorite. What ultimately detracts from the experience for me, is the absolute disjointedness of the narrative. And I don't mean that the story jumps around a lot, a la Watchmen. What I mean is that the layout of each page is so hard to follow that it actually made me feel like I was losing my mind. Perhaps this was the intention, I don't know. But the art is incredibly surreal and isn't conducive to a brisk reading pace. The same can be said for the text on the page. With its erratic placement, I often did not know which line I was supposed to read next, and without any discernable cells to go off of, it quickly becomes difficult to create a pace at which to read at.Now, the story itself is actually quite good, but I cannot get over the layout and the art style. It's just not for me. I prefer clean lines."
4,Masterful work with a book binding problem,"I am not a big fan of superhero comic books, but I have read a handful of the genre's graphic novels, including Arkham Asylum.Arkham Asylum blew me away. I feel like this medium is at its best when the graphical flavor is as adventurous as its textual and thematic flavor, and this book is a perfect example of my preference. Like Mignola's Hellboy, Arkham Asylum is just gorgeous from one cover to the next.The only gripe I have is with the book binding. I had to almost break the book's spine in half in order to get a full view of some of the panels."
3,Great Story. Doesn't cross over well to Kindle.,"The story line is great, however the graphics and the inking do not cross over well to the kindle version (I read it on an iPad). I had to strain to read a lot of the dialogue and some of the art did not render well. I checked it out on my Kindle fire and it looked the same."
4,"Really good, almost perfect, but...","I would have given it 5 stars if it weren't for the part where Batman asks Commissioner Gordon ""What's up?"" Seriously, he is the commissioner of police, not one of your stupid friends. Grow up."
5,"Creepy and surreal, and very creative","Length:: 5:20 MinsI'm Sonicsuns, and this my odd little review for Arkham Asylum: A Serious House on Serious Earth."
3,A Day in the Insane Asylum,"With the artwork, the text (I could barely understand any of Joker's comments what with the crazy font he speaks in throughout the graphic novel), this graphic novel makes you feel as if you are IN the asylum with everyone. It seems less about Batman, who is largely in the foreground it feels, and more about the story behind the legendary, mysterious, haunting and notorious Arkham Asylum and how it came to be and what it has become with people like Joker running the show."
3,Visually interesting but not for a comic,Very interesting artwork and cool story but it is hard to follow. The artwork in here doesn't work for me as a reader. To see them as individual frames they are quite amazing but they are simply to busy and blurred for me to look at and absorb as a story.
2,Poorly executed,"Arkham Asylum suffers from very poor execution. The plot is well-conceived and pulled off well enough given the dialog, but the art style hampers everything down. It seems there are no light fixtures in Arkham Asylum, as every panel is about 90 percent shadow. There is a font used for everything that The Joker says that was a chore to try to read; I had to put the book up to my nose to figure out which letters were which.If you're a huge Batman fan, you've probably already read this. If not, don't bother."
1,Sucks,"Dont waste your money on this. Spend it on Year One, Killing Joke etc. The story and drawings are awful"
1,Ugh...,"I was horribly disappointed with this book. There's two different kinds of Grant Morrison writing. The REALLY REALLY good stuff. Then he has the really weird, outlandish, Throw a million ideas into one issue, writing. This book was the latter. Dreadful, confusing, and Annoying art. There was points when I literally COULDN'T read the dialoge which really bothered me. And overall the story was just garbage. Wouldn't recommend it to my worst of enemies."
4,I bought this for my husband,"I bought this for my husband. I wanted it for the art but i didnt like them, i thought they were gonna be more like the front cover however my husband did like them and he said the book itself really twisted and dark a lot different from alot of the other ones. Deffinatly not for kids."
2,"Good potential, poor execution -","Am I a Batman fan? Yes. But not a zealot.I love graphic novels, this one failed to deliver on two counts:1- it is difficult to read, the lettering for all of joker's lines is hard to read and strains the eye... a graphic novel should not be like that.2- it was a great opportunity to show Batman's dark and confusing mind... they started to do so and then dropped it.Not one I would recommend."
2,Insert Batman to sell comic books,"Wow what can I say about this graphic novel... I honestly didn't like this book, but just because I didn't like this book doesn't mean I can give it a 1 star. It was a book, it had color and technically it was completed. After reading this book I felt like the author's just wanted to shock me. It didn't feel like a true batman story, and the ending was a joke. I don't want to give anything away, but the way they made Harvey look in this book was horrible. Took his coin away and moved him Tarot cards, give me a break.On the extra content, it's nice to have, but it's completely unneccesary. Infact after reading through it I was certian that the author was just trying for the shock and aww effect."
1,Terrible,"I have to agree with the other poor reviews. We found the comic terribly illustrated, hard to read, and just not very entertaining. We ended up just reading the text written part in the back. Save it for the jeph loeb series."
1,Not happy with this version of Batman,"After reading The Dark Knight and The Killing Joke, I had high expectations for Arkham Asylum. I was very disappointed however. Like in other Batman books and comics, Batman displays cunningness, being fearless, being athletic, and just being a bad ass hero. He did not display anything in this book. The villains did not display their specialties or twisted selves as they do in other books or comics. The drawings were interesting, not great, just interesting. The story was too short and meaningless. Perhaps I did not understand or interpret the story the way the writers, Morrison and McKean wanted to portray Batman. Still, the story was too short to overanalyze. This book is going as far as I can throw it! Or to someone who wants to experience this bland version of a Batman story."
1,Arkham Asylum: Seriously Is That Even A Font?,"Avoid this like the plague. The art is god awful, the writing is illegible, and the plot itself is absolute garbage.Look up a few pages online if you're curious what I mean. It looks like someone painted it (art and writing) while on the brink of passing out from too much booze.If you want a real Batman graphic novel, go for something from either Miller or Loeb. Morrison can't write whatsoever."
2,Extremely difficult to read,"Please note that the two stars are for the quality of the digital kindle copy of this book, rather than the story itself (which I'm sure would have been a decent read if I had been able to understand it). I should have read more of the reviews, because really half the of dialogue in this graphic novel is impossible to make out on my kindle fire hd. The panel viewing does very little to make reading easier, in fact I think that it subtracts from the beauty of the artwork by chopping bits of the page up and zooming in on them. This was my first time buying a graphic novel on my kindle (something I had really been looking forward to was reading comic books on it), and maybe I'll try it again in the future, but you're better off buying a physical copy of this. I'm really disappointed with this purchase and am returning it for a refund, I'm hoping that maybe this is just a one-time deal and that other graphic novels will be easier to read and enjoy on my kindle."
5,GREAT look into the psychology of Batman,"This book is a great look into the psychology of Batman and his world. While i've loved this artist for a long time (sandman, books of magic, etc), my favorite part has to be the final script for the comic included at the back. the notes and details included there make this a must-own, as you will constantly find yourself wanting to re-read parts of it and flipping back and forth between the art and the script. Truly a great piece of work that stands apart from the flock and weathers the test of time which often ruins many great comic stories."
3,Decent Batman Story,"Although a wonderful piece of work, I wasn't really blown away with this story. It was decent. Nothing more nothing less. The artwork is very appealing, but I thought it was rather arcane, even for a tale of the dark knight."
3,You will like it or you won't,This isn't really a standard Batman title as other reviews hinted at. The artwork is very different as is probably intended. The whole story is a glimpse into the psychosis of Batman and his rogue's gallery. The story and artworks is subject to interpretation. I didn't really care for the story but like the effort that was put in. Definitely read first before purchasing.
5,Joker really are wild....,"This is dark, creepy and so much fun. Got me hooked and ready for more. Those who are interested in the much more bitter side of any graphic novel will get a lovely little kick out of this one. I had to read it twice to take in all of the amazing details both written and drawn. It was wonderful to see the not so goofy side of the Joker and all of gang in Arkham, including Batman himself."
3,A darker path..,"This is different. the artwork was not what I was used to.The story is good, Be aware that the subject matter is for mature audiences"
3,Maybe Not So Much a Classic,"Somehow being a huge comic and graphic novel fan and even being a big Batman fan - for decades - I never got around to reading this. I finally did and was pretty disappointed. Dave McKean's fantastic art made it worth reading, but the writing was not something that would make this book anything close to a classic in the Batman canon. The intercutting tale of Arkham's namesake is interesting but not that rewarding. The other tale featuring Batman's criminally insane foes comes off as rather simplistic and watered down when compared to some of the Dark Knights better books."
1,Item not compatible with this device (pc),"Virtually impossible to read on the fire without the aid of a magnifying glass... didn't seem like a big deal, after all I can just read it on my pc... wait, no I can't. Is this some f'd up ploy to get me to buy the same mediocre comic twice?This is the last time I pay for a digital comic. If I'm gonna blow 10 dollars, might as well cut amazon out of the picture and just go buy a physical copy."
3,"Great artwork, no Batman though...","The artwork is amazing, truly makes the Joker look like a real mad man who actually can scare you. However, outside of the art work, the story is shallow and boring, with hardly any Batman. Another problem is that the text is hard to read, especially for the Joker, it's so stylized that you'll be straining to read it."
2,Uninspiring,"This was one of my least favorate Batman comics. Lots of disturbing hack and slash movie feel to it. Not a lot going on, no big mistery to solve. Artwork was wierd and different. Batman's bloody mouth, Two-face's fungus looking side of his face, everything looked distorated. Writing was hard to read sometimes. Could be good for others, but no my cup of tea."
2,"Great Art, So-so Story","I'm a big fan of Batman, particularly his conflicts about criminal insanity.I've collected a few comics, but I wouldn't say I'm a comic buff or anything.-The artwork is beautiful and dark.-The story is just dark and sort of poorly paced. It felt like I was reading Cliff's notes of Batman's journey into Arkham Asylum.There were a few cool moments, but if I had it to do over again, I probably wouldn't buy it."
1,Do NOT buy on Kindle Fire!,Bought this about five minutes ago for my new Kindle Fire. It is not possible to zoom or rotate at all and it is entirely unreadable. Until this is resolved I cannot recommend purchasing it for Kindle. :( Very disappointed!
5,One of the Best Comics Ever.,This installment of the Batman series is the most serious and fascinating. The artwork is supurb. And the writing and hellish situation makes for one of the best comics of all time.
4,A different view of the Batman universe,"This Batman grpahic novel shows a side of Batman that isn't often explored, but everyone knows is there (if they follow Batman that is). What happens if the inmates are running the Asykum? Pick up this graphic novel and find out."
4,As dark as the dark knight gets,"If you're looking for a dark story revolving around batman, this is the graphic novel to go to. Batman is blackmailed into entering arkham asylum when Joker and some of the dark knight's other enemies take over the old, converted mansion. What follows is a mix between an uncovering of the twisted history of the asylum and batman seeking to overcome his own potential madness and some of Gotham's greatest villains. The story is told in almost surreal images that fit and enhance the dark mood perfectly.A warning to those used to a more ""normal"" artistic style, arkham asylum is what would usually be referred to as very experimental. If you're looking for your average batman graphic novel/ comic, this may not be the place to go. Otherwise, I highly recommend it."
5,Amazing!,"EDIT: After maturing and re-reading this recently, I can honestly say that my review below was horrible, and that this is actually one of Batman's best graphic novels ever written! Must-buy for any Batman-Joker fan wanting to get some psychological thriller kinda thing as well.----Old review:I got this along with ""The Joker"" by Brian Azzerelo, and frankly, both have disappointed me. There was actually barely any plot, and even if there was, it was spread widely and slowly throughout the whole 100+ pages!The artwork, i must say, was dreadful, for everything was just smudged all over each other, which is very annoying, and Batman is barely clear throughout the story. The story was flawed and lacked excitement.But it was a mediocre story to read anyway, and it does have the element of darkness."
3,"Good Story, But the Artwork...","This book is really a history of Arkham and its founder more than it is a Batman story, and the story is a dark one indeed. The artwork is much different from that of other Batman graphic novels I have purchased (Batman: Year One,Batman: The Long Halloween,Batman: The Dark Knight Returns,Batman: The Dark Knight Strikes Again) and is a little hard to get used to; I had to really struggle to figure out what Joker was saying. This is the story of Arkham, and it is a very good, if somewhat dark and depressing; but then again, this is Gotham. It makes me wonder if there's some sort of otherworldy / supernatural beacon in the city that attracts criminals, crazies and crazy criminals."
3,"Too short, didn't like the art",I sadly don't have much to add besides the fact that I wanted more of the story and that the art hurt me. It wasn't bad I just didn't like the style at all.You do end up buying a lot of bonus scripts and concept pages so yeah.
2,Disappointing,"After watching The Dark Knight I was very excited and eager to read more about Batman. I have been a comic book addict ever since I can remember, but mostly I bought Marvel comics and had only occasionally read Batman. Anyway, I researched in the internet for the best / most important Batman TPBs available and Arkham Asylum was listed everywhere as one of them (in some places even among the top 5). For this reason and also because of the reviews here, I decided to buy this one. But it turned out to be a huge disappointment. The art is really bad, you often can't make out what is on the page... may be it's just a different style, but it doesn't match my taste (I'm more of Jim Lee fan kind of guy). The story itself - the writing I mean - was ok, but I wouldn't qualify it as being one of the best Batman comics - certainly not after reading Year One, The Long Halloween and The Dark Knight Returns."
1,hard to grasp due to outlandish artwork,"While the story holds in this book, the artwork made it hard to follow as well as to understand. It all makes sense when you read the script notes in the back of the book, but while actually reading with the art it becomes confusing and annoying. While the artwork is at times interesting, it does not match the story in the traditional sense. Random characters are thrown into panels where you can't understand what they're doing or as to why the are even there. I bought ""The Killing Joke"" as well as one simply entitled ""Joker"", they were both much better reads."
1,Artwork unsuitable for a narrative,"As my title says, the artwork is completely unsuitable for any type of narrative, least of all a graphic novel. Don't get me wrong, even though I'm not a fan of that style I'll admit they're nice illustrations, but they it's completely impossible to follow any kind of narrative, even if it's Batman just throwing a punch you would have to look at the frames over and over again just to understand that.The story is pretty crappy aswel, the characters are really modified to fit the writers needs and it just comes out as characters with random personalities.I would definitely not recommend this to anyone."
3,Beautiful,The artwork is amazing! Any batman fan should read this. I wish there could have been more to it because it was s quick read.
4,An empowering guide on how to hear our inner voice,"This book is an invaluable resource for understanding and practicing the ability to recognize, hear and act from a place of knowing. Winter articulates with such ease what is so often felt and so infrequently expressed. Her personal story is one that everyone can relate to. I found the book extremely helpful to validate my personal efforts in this area. It gave me confidence to pursue my goals with a new sense of power in my ability to listen and act from a place within."
2,Not worth the money,"I originally bought the Spooky Kids concert DVD ""Birth of the Antichrist,"" and it does contain really excellent, one-of-a-kind footage of Manson performing in an intimate club setting. Knowing this, I purchased the album thinking it would play the exact same soundtrack, from beginning to end. Instead, it plays the songs of the concert in a mixed order. What's worse is that rather than having the songs smoothly move from one track to the next, each one would suddenly stop and start, which annoyed me because it made the whole of the CD very choppy and disruptive. It doesn't even play the live version of ""Dope Hat;"" on that track is ""Chocolate Factory."" Take it from me: if you are a big Manson fan, I strongly recommend buying the DVD, not the CD."
2,Failed,"I have been a nba live fan forever and this 2006 copy may have ruined it for me. the screen shots are HORRIBLE, no francise mode, you can be 3 feet tall and block a players shot whos 7 feet tall....I would give this game away to anyone who wants it..this was a major rush job and if the xbox 360 is gonna continue to put out games like this i'll go to Sony"
1,NBA LIVE 06 (LIKE EVERY OHTER XBOX 360 EA SPORTS GAME STINKS),"This is the worst NBA Live out on any large gaming platform (PS2, XBOX, GAmecube, heck even PSP). The graphics with this game are not that much better than on regular XBOX, so if you are buying a 360 for this game please stop it. There are not many features on this game. No dunk contest, not all star weekend, nothing, nada. This game basically sucks. If you want a good basketball game for this system that doesn't sacrifice itself for marginially better graphics, get NBA 2K6. This game has great graphics, great realistic gameplay, more modes, and interesting side gimmicks."
2,Don't sweat it,"When EA's biggest gimmick is a 30 second commercial of shaq sweating, you know you have problems. Without dynasty mode and various other features, Live stands incomplete leaving the user looking for their receipt. It's obvious that Live's transformation into the next-generation was rushed in hopes of getting the game out in time for the xbox 360 release. The gameplay is slow, there are major camera glitches (there are times when the camera completely loses sight of the game), to put it simply, the game is just boring. The one bright spot however is its graphics. Looking past the sweat, the player animations are extraordinary. Recognizing your favorite players are not a problem. In all, after playing Live 2006, you realize it actually offers less than its xbox and PS2 counterparts. If you're looking for a good basketball game, I suggest getting 2k6."
2,not so much fun,"I'm going to make this short. I was disappointed. The graphics are nice, but the game play is just average. NBA jam back in the early ninties is was more fun this game."
1,YOU HAVE TO BE KIDDING ME!!!!,"Its sad I have to get out my old XBOX and play my old NBA LIVE 2006 to enjoy a quality game. Other than the graphics this game is terrible. The camera angles are ridiculous. I tried every camera angle in the game and the game play was still hard to follow. There were times I slammed the ball and the camera wasnt even showing the basket. I just heard the dunk in the back ground and I'd be seeing some akward did not make sense camera picture. Also the players move A LOT slower. It definitely took fun away from the game. EA better get it together because the quality of this game sucks. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!! If you are an EA Sports fan and those are the primary games you'll play on XBOX 360 don't even buy the system. SAD, SAD, SAD, EA should be ashamed!!!"
3,Bargain Bin Only,"If you see this one in a bargain bin for ten bucks, then you may want to pick it up. I wouldn't pay full price for this one.There are a couple of things I liked: Creating a player is amazingly detailed. It would have been neat to create a team of superhuman players like I was able to do on my old Nintendo Baseball game.Graphics are neat. The faces don't look perfect, but you can see who the players are. In fact, for me, the graphics is the only thing that save this clunker from being a one star game.The music is terrible and annoying. I don't like rap, and all the music appears to be rap.The menu controls are not intuitive. Game play is rather boring.What I'd pay: Less than $3.00. Graphics can only go so far."
5,Wow,"I defy you to listen to the title cut the Outsider on your personal cd player and not completely well up with emotion. The tune, the arranging and his hard edged yet emotional playing--it shows you that there are jazz artists out there that can give you something meaningful without pretense and over complicated line. Check out Pat Metheny's comments about him. The best artists know who's really good. Joel's work is outstanding too. Nearly all the cuts are winners. Walt's playing is influenced by Coltrane but you also hear a little of Larry Schneider's influence. The rest is Walt. May he continue to develop and move us."
4,*Provoking Book*,"Upon seeing a full page ad in a recent Sojourners magazine I was very excited about reading this book.And though it certainly a thought provoking and challenging read, I was a bit disappointed by its writing style and extreme bias.I would recommend this book to anyone who is looking to challenge themselves, who has an open mind and a strong faith.I would not recommend this book to a new believer."
5,A beautiful and inspiring book - a must for progressive Christians!,"Many thanks to Dr. Elnes for this clearly and beautifully stated set of principles that makes it easy for us progressive Christians to identify and talk about our beliefs. As someone who had previously lost all faith in God, and who has become more and more alarmed in recent years at our nation's apparent swing toward fundamentalism, this book speaks to me eloquently in so many ways --- and it's all based on something so simple: loving God, loving your neighbor, and loving yourself. Seems obvious, doesn't it? I strongly urge progressive Christians to read this book, and to recommend it to their not-so-progressive friends in the hope that they, too, can become more accepting of their fellow men and, especially, that they might come to know our all-loving God."
4,Good but could be better,"I bought this book to help me create a family cookbook. The book has thousands (I'm guessing here) of foods listed. My only complaints are I wish it had an index because you never know if something is listed under type of food or brand name. And, I wish it listed sugar, saturated and unsaturated fats instead of just carbs and total fat. It's still one of the best food count books that I have found."
2,doesn't have it all,"While this book contains a ton of data, don't get it if you want calorie counts on anything homemade. If you look up french toast, for example, it only gives information on name brand items. Much of the information in the book is available on the packaging of the products. I suppose that if you wanted to check it before shopping, or use it before eating out, it would be helpful. But if you want to find out the caloric content of any homemade items, you are out of luck with this book."
2,Several Mistakes!,"I just purchased the book and found several mistakes. Avocados have significantly more fiber than the listing indicates according to the Calif. Avocado Council. Post(Nabisco) Shredded Wheat n' Bran is listed as having no fiber! If you are the authority on this subject I would have thought these obvious mistakes would have been caught. This is only in my first couple of times opening the book, who knows how many other mistakes are there. I will be searching for a more accurate book on nutrition information."
2,It's hard to read,"It has tons of information; both fresh and processed foods, but I found it difficult to look at the pages. The cheap, greyish, mass market paperback pages are fine for a novel and straight through reading, but when you're trying to follow a tiny chart it makes it hard to do. After looking at all the food counting books in the bookstore, I finally found one compact book with medium stock, bright paper and great info that was easy on the eyes for just $2 more. The Ultimate Calorie, Carb, & Fat Gram Counter by Lea Ann Holzmeister. I recommend that one over the Netzer book."
4,Still Waiting,"This is a ""must have"" book. Can't live without it if your a counter..... This is my third edition purchase, I like all the updated info, but the book does need an ""index"". It makes it semi-difficult to located items quickly, thank god for post-it-notes. The other disappointment is that the items listed seem to be from the east coast. I live on the west coast and have never heard of most of the brand names, but this is the best book on the market to date. Enjoy!"
3,Not For Me,"The counts on the book didn't match up with what the counts my nutritionist gave me , so I stopped using the book."
2,not as much info as I want might be enough for you,wished it listed more information such as type of sugars(i.e. HFCS)and things like phe levels
4,Useful but annoying,"The information is comprehensive but often difficult to find and there are a number of commonly eaten foods I have as yet not been able to find at all. Very good for calculating meals from food chains, a bit time consuming to look up each individual ingredient for home prepared meals. The way the items are listed leaves a lot to be desired."
4,What about sugar?,"I am a hypoglycemic with family member's who are diabetics. This book gave me a general idea by displaying the protein and carbohydrate levels of some of the foods that I eat. The only problem was that there was no mention of the sugar content of these foods which is just as important, if not the most important. Overall it was one of the best books I've ever bought. Thank You"
3,disappointing,"I purchased this book because it was mentioned in the Curves plan. I personally did not like the layout and format and size of book. Listings for some common items, such as French fries, were difficult to find."
5,When It Really Counts!,"I am amazed at the scope of this book. I could take even my most complicated recipes and construct a total, divide into serving sizes, and calculate total carbs, calories, etc. For someone on a diabetes diet - or struggling to lose weight through diet and exercise - this book is essential."
2,Breakdown of fibers,"I have not seen this book, but what I am looking for is the breakdown of the amount of soluable and insoluable fiber in whole foods. I don't go to fast food places nor do I eat much processed foods. Does this bood address this point?"
4,Not really complete,fails to list sugar content as a separate item from carbohydrates - otherwise OK
4,knitter,As always book was received in very good condition.Always pleased with my orders of used books.
4,Very complete,The Complete Book of Food Counts is perfect for what I need. I need to count carbohydrates for a family member & just about every food you can think of is in this book. It's certainly portable and just plain works for me.
5,Food Sure Does Count!!,"I've been on a famous eating plan for a while and have lost almost 20 pounds to date. I have bought a special calculator so that I don't have to write down what I eat. This is where this book comes in. It is INDISPENSIBLE because it lists calories, fat content, and fiber (and other important info) which is the info I need for this calculator. Thank you Corinne T. Netzer!!!"
2,Major flaw,"I think this book has good information but there is a major flaw - it does not list sugar grams. For diabetics, those who have insulin resistance and those who have had gastric bypass surgery, this is vital information. Too bad this wasn't included in what is otherwise a pretty good book."
3,Anything Goes,"This is an album that I have been trying to find for several years. When it first was released I had in on 8-track. I found this on Amazon and was happy to get it. However, this edition of the album was in mono. I don't think it is quite as good as the stero version. It was origianlly released in both versions. Try and get it in stereo. Still, this is one of my favorite recordings. The group produced wonderful harmony and some really nice songs. The album is sort of like a show, with a beginning and end. Again, a great album-just try finding it in stereo."
5,A Delightful Book,"This is a wonderful book for the whole family. It's hard these days to find a picture book where the narrative is as compelling as the illustrations. This is one of those rare books. The folk tale is refreshingly new and unfamiliar, and teaches a lesson not often heard in children's books. And Kristen Balouch's brilliant sense of color and design have a warmth and humor that is really appealing. I wish I could decorate my home with these pages!I look forward to more books from this talented illustrator."
5,One of the best Christmas Albums Ever,"You can't go wrong with Elvis' Christmas Album-a true classic in every sense of the word. Ranks right up there with other rock & roll holiday albums like those put out by WCBS-FM(the Ultimate Christmas albums)and even the best of all, A Christmas Gift For You by Phil Spector. Side one has all the rockin' tinsel tunes, and side two has Elvis' versions of beautiful Christmas hymns. A must for your collection whether or not you're an Elvis fan, to think he recorded this when he was just 22 years old. Now this was talent!"
2,"Buy the album ""Elvis Christmas"" instead","I'm not saying anything bad about this album in particular - the songs are a solid selection and so forth. However, if you buy the similar ""Elvis Christmas"" album, you will get every song on this one (except for ""Medley"") plus about ten more, and at the exact same price. It's just a better value."
5,Best Christmas album,"I listen to this album every year at Christmas time. Elvis has the most beautiful voice ever. When the lights are low and the tree is on, this album just puts you in holiday mood. We grew up listening to these songs every year, it's not Christmas with out it."
2,Damaged,"This book was labeled nearly new, which it is clearly not. Looks water damaged on the bottom and there is a LARGE sticker on the cover. Very disappointing."
2,Give me a break!,"Give me a break. The Section 20 intelligence branch in this series is the most inept ever. I don't like my action heroes to be infallible but these characters contantly make decisions and/or take actions that are irrational, irresponsible, immoral, insane or all four. Whenever something needs to be done, too few people are always sent, even if more are readily available. Then after something goes wrong, and things are always going wrong for Section 20, the heroes walk around cursing and looking puzzled and promising to get even.The only reason I am giving this a 2nd star is that I really like the plot line about weapons of mass destruction. (slight spoiler coming, although the info is in an early episode)I like the premise that some people in or affiliated with the Bush Administration were so anxious to invade Iraq that they tried to plant weapons of mass destruction there so the inspectors would find them. I wouldn't put that past Bush and Cheney."
3,Yes!,What is not to like great spy stories nudity guns it is a guys show for sure. If you find a girl who likes it she is a keeper.
5,exciting,"good show! doesn't take itself too seriously. good action and decent plot scenes. good, popcorn-fun! recommend giving this a try."
3,"Buyers beware: This is season 2, not season 1","Strike Back season 2 have a good story, and good cinematography with believeable photography.Its shortcomings are the lack of memorable characters, something season 1 had, especially with Richard Armitage's character, John Porter. Also I find the amount of violence shown exceeding my preference.If you expect the same quality in all aspects as season 1, you will probably be disappointed. But if you expect it to be something on its own, rather than a regular follow-up season, then you can find liking season 2 easier.Here is season 1 on BD:Chris Ryan's Strike Back (Blu-ray Disc)"
4,Never heard of it,"I never heard of this show while it was on TV, probably because I don't get Cinemax. Now I am a cable cutter entirely. I saw this on Amazon and found it interesting, bought it and it was pretty good. I was surprised that I liked it as much as I did since I never heard of it before. These are good adventure stories of British secret agents solving the world's Terrorist problems, of course they have an American on the team and they are brutal with their team members, many of which do not make it thru the entire series. So for a good shoot 'em up I think this is worth 4 stars."
3,I think it has a chance,It's a little cheesy but I found it entertaining overall. I'll give it a few more episodes and decide further. It is action packed and full of good special effects.
1,Do Not Buy,"This book was sold to me as Sydney's Old Arcadia, but in fact, when I received the book, I found it to be full of spelling errors and nonsensical wordings. It looked like someone had simply attempted to copy and paste Sydney's original work and then accidentally threw in several more letters for the fun of it. The entire book was entirely impossible to read. I thought I was getting a good deal, because of the cheap price of this book, but it's nothing more than a scam and rip off. Do not buy this book unless you sorely feel the need to throw your money out the window."
5,Excelllent and quick delivery since it came from Japan,Rock gods do a great collaboration/tribute to one of the greatest bands of our or any era. Worth every penny.
1,SPITFIRE RELEASING THIS IN DEC. 2007 FOR $13.99 / DON'T GET RIPPED OFF!!!,"BEWARE PEOPLE! SPITFIRE IS RE-RELEASING THIS CD IN DECEMBER 2007 FOR $13.99 SO DON'T GET RIPPED OFF BY THESE SELLERS TRYING TO RAPE PEOPLE WITH THEIR $100.00 PRICE!! LAUGH AT THEM WHEN THEY ARE STUCK COMPETING WITH THE NEW ONES FOR $13.990 AND THESE LOSERS THEN WILL BE LUCKY TO GET $5.99 FOR THEIR OLD, OUT OF DATE CD'S....LOL!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Wonderful follow-up!,"This is Ronnie at the height of his stunning career. From the pure country smash from 1985, ""She Keeps the Home Fires Burning"" to the smooth, soul-influenced ""Lost in the '50s Tonight"" this album features Milsap at his best. Although Milsap changed the style he played in the mid-70s by this time, his music nonetheless always satisfied and it is definitely a must-have for the country collector, pop collector, or the Milsap fan."
1,"Nasty, Brutal, and Short!",This five page cheat sheet looks like it was cooked up in about three minutes. Very little information and not very comprehensive. I could not give it lower than one star. NOT worth the seven dollars paid. Thumbs down for trying to peddle such garbage!
4,Fun Album!,"I've been a JLH fan since her 'Kids Incorporated' days and I love her music.This is a great pop album and this girl had and still has,a wonderful voice. My fave cuts are: Bedtime Stories,Dancing Queen,Won't U B Mine,Listen (To Your Heart),and What's It Gonna Take. Bottom line,it's all good."
1,She sounds like a horse with an expensive recording studio,I thought J. Love sounded like doggy doo.
3,"Comfortable, but not the greatest seal","I bought these for $20 along with the $7 Milwaukee muffs from amazon. I wanted a primary pair for shooting, and then a back up or spare for a friend. The Radians are a lot more comfortable, and I think I could wear them for a much longer time, but the cheap Milwaukee muffs seam to provide a better seal and more noise reduction. The Radians supposedly have a higher rating (Milwaukee: 28 NRR, Radians: 29 NRR), but on my head, the Milwaukee muffs just feel tighter and a bit more solid against my skin.I'm glad I bought two pair, I have one that's comfy and one that seals well. I thought the radians would be great on both fronts, but they don't seem to offer as much protection for me."
2,Barely any ink!,"Yes these are cheaper than when you buy them at the store. That's where the pros end. This cartridge printed less than 100 pages before the ink started to run out/fade. For the same price, you can get the LD 74XL remanufactured cartridge. Those last for closer to 1,000 pages."
2,HP 74,Poor printing. It did improve after shaking Very short life. I soaked the first one in alcohol but it still was disappointing
2,Out of ink again in a short amount of time!,"HP ink cartridges seem to have a shorter life span now more than ever. I don't think that I managed to print even 100 pages from this cartridge before running out of ink. It did print well before running out of ink. After some research, I decided to change to another brand of printer. Hope to have better ink life with the new one!"
2,less than 200 pages,Poor quality. It ran out after I printed approx. 100 pages.I will never buy it again. It is expensive and wear out quickly.
1,Already out of ink!,"I purchased this product about a month ago, and have barely printed anything with it; certainly less than 60 pages. I'm already running out of ink! Something is wrong here if I'm paying $15 to print 10 papers on my personal printer. I'm pretty disgusted with the product and would not recommend it."
1,Was not pleased,I bought two cartridges about eight months ago and used one of them right away and it worked fine. I am now trying to use the second one and it will not print. I get blank pages so I can only assume that this cartridge is defective. I will not order from this place again.
1,Are these not even half full?,After printing only 60 pages it started to fade. I checked Ink levels and the computer says its empty. It wont work at all anymore. This was the first time I tried buying a refurbished cartridge. Id finish by saying you get what you pay for but I didnt even get that!!!
4,HP quality,"My problem relates more with the delivery than product.I requested next day delivery. YES, it came the next day around 7:00 PM. With the price of the product and the shipment, I could have done as well with Staples.Rather disappointed."
4,Wish the ink lasted longer,"Not much to say about the product - it's ink after all. The only problem I have with these ink cartridges is the fact that they seem to run out of ink fairly quickly, so that's a bummer. Otherwise, it's a good product, so four stars."
3,"Clogged, Then Fixed","Pros:Worked great until it cloggedCons:None of the HP cleaning routines would get it workingRemedy:I soaked the print head portion in alcohol for 10-minutes and then it worked fine.Comments:I prefer HP printers because they just work with no hassle, this is only the second time I've had an HP ink jet clog. Wish I'd thought of the alcohol soak the first time."
1,Short on ink,"I just used HP 74 Ink in my printer and after 4 days, I got low ink reportI printed about 60 pages."
3,Going for the 74XL next,"I bought two of these cartridges to go with my new printer; the price was right. However; now that I've found out how to do fast draft on my printer, these cartridges still run out of ink fast. I'm a writer/researcher so I go through a lot of copies per week. So, I've ordered the HP 74XL, here's hoping I'll get more copies before I have to change out cartridges!www.sociosights.com"
5,black ink cartrilage bought at Amazon,I bought a new ink cartrige for my printer.The cartrilage was put in my printer shortlty after it arrived--it works fine.
3,Remanufactured Print Cartridge,The problem I had with this ink Cartridge is that it did notshow the full amount on the screen. But other then that it printedgood.
5,Prompt delivery of a dependable product,"I ordered two HP 74 Black Ink cartridges. They were priced cheaper than if I went to a brick and mortar store and the shipment was prompt. The cartridges were in excellent shape and performed the way they are supposed to. Great price, availability, and quality. Try to beat that!"
3,review on 74 ink,this doesn't really go with my printer (My fault for not looking at serial number) but i made it work.
1,Stopped working,"This cartridge came in a generic casing and only worked for a short while. I contacted the seller and they offered some troubleshooting tips but would not send a new product. Wiping the cartridge with alcohol helped it work for one more print job, but then the printer could not read the cartridge again. Wish I would have bought an HP one to avoid the trouble."
5,"Quality ink, professionally packaged.","For this price, you can't go wrong. It's the same ink as anywhere but for 1/2 price! Definitely worth buying. I'll buy more from Amazon for sue."
4,I Must Be Getting Old!,"I must be getting old because I'm listening to this...and liking it! LOL I picked it up for the ""Theme from 'The Molly Maguires'"", a beautiful tune from a none-too-beautiful movie about militant coalminers. However, in addition to themes from The Pink Panther, Breakfast at Tiffany's, Days of Wine and Roses, and Charade; there are fine tunes from The Thorn Birds, Victor/Victoria and other Mancini favorites like ""Moon River"", ""Speedy Gonzales"", and ""Baby Elephant Walk"". Most all are played in the ""easy listening"" style for which Mancini is known; Galway on flute never extends himself beyond those bounds.This is fine ""feel-good"" music to fill your listening space, but it's somewhat short measure for a CD at only about 42 minutes...or you can simply press ""repeat"" as I often do."
5,I liked this book!,At 11 years old I understood and liked most of the poems. There were many that I really liked.
1,"If I could give this 0 stars, I would...","I've had all the problems mentioned by all the reviewers here and on the DirecTv forums. This machine is a total waste. I was done with DirecTV this summer (problems with the ""mover's advantage"" program but the salesman convinced me to stick with them. I love the programming, but the R15 is a total waste of time and money. Just imagine trying to watch the Ohio State - Texas football game but the DVR keeps ""skipping"" like a scratched CD. We missed most of the game because of this piece of garbage.I guess this is why I like reading so much...no power cables, no ""bugs"", no software downloads!"
2,DirecTV could do better,"I had many of the same problems as the first reviewer. Frequent lock-ups requiring a hard reset by climbing behind the entertainment center to unplug the unit, blips in the recording and mysterious lines from time to time, dropped audio, the list goes on.The remote is blocky and unintuitive with too many and oddly placed buttons. Punching in channel numbers requires you to look at the remote and use both hands to shift the position of it, then push the tiny buttons way down at the bottom of the remote while you continue to hold it in both hands.On the upside the R15 does have alot of functionality built into it, it's just too bad the built-in 1 & 1/2 second delay makes it all so frustrating to navigate."
2,It's Ok!!,This thing wasn't what I execpted. The remote is rarely fast. It barely does anything during thunderstorms and sometimes we have to fix it. Wasn't the best product i've had. Buy it if you want to. Not the best product.
2,So many problems,"I have two of these, both have different problems. Main one is it's VERY SLOW in everything; changing the channel to accessing the menu. I got a replacement at a cost of $20 shipping to me and a month later, same thing. Both are slow. These should be free for how crappy they are. But hey, it still works!"
1,Do not buy from Jeffrey Menos,"I ordered the DIRECTV R15 Receiver/Digital Video Recorder--Up to 100 Hours and received an email stating that it had been shipped. Then when I emailed the seller to ask for a tracking/shipping number he said that he didn't have anymore and was very sorry but he would send me out another item that was comparable for what I had already paid him. I didn't know much about the product that I was ordering and feel that this seller took advantage of my lack of knowledge. He sent me a DirecTV TIVO HR10-250 HD-DVR Receiver, upon hooking it up, it does not record, it is slow and does not offer the HD channels we have. Upon speaking to Directv customer service they informed me that what I received is an older model that does not have good quality and the capability for HD tv. Upon contacting this seller to return the product for full refund and offering to pay to ship it back to him I received no response and still haven't received any communication from the seller."
1,Another Piece of Garbage from a Company That Hate's Customers,"This piece of gear is terrible. It's slow and unresponsive, setting it up for PIP is an absurd pain in the neck that requires multiple input lines, it's impossible to search, sort and navigate. Everything about it is junk, but none more than the company that provides it. DirecTV's service is generally pretty good as far as content and HD quality, but their customer service is so bad it almost seem as if they are intentionally trying to alienate customers. They take the concept of hidden charges to startling new heights. HD service; $10/mo. Each additional receiver; $5/mo. DVR service; $10/mo. That equipment you paid $250 for; that was just a lease! It's another $399 to buy it. Want ESPN classic? How about a $20 sports package filled with all kinds of other useless crap? Just don't cancel before the mandatory two months is up or you'll pay penalty.If you enjoy paying a lot and being jerked around by customer service, I recommend DirecTV."
1,The worst combination of hardware and software I've ever seen,"I have worked as both an electronic technician and computer programmer for the past 40 years.NEVER have I seen a more worthless combination of hardware/software.Direct TV's solution to all problems is to reformat the hard drive.Microsoft operating systems are bad, but at least all you have to do is reboot.Imagine if after every 75 hours of using your PC you had to reformat the hard drive!Would you consider that acceptable?The core problem is the operating system for the R15 does NOT have a disk defragment utility.As the hard drive becomes increasingly fragmented performance and reliability degrade.The only recourse is to reformat the hard drive, which of course erases everything on the disk.So you lose all setup/configuration settings and recorded programs..."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS or Even Take It as a Gift.,"Run from this box. If you have never tried a TiVo, do so. This DVR doesn't come close to the capability of a TiVo. DirecTV programming and service is outstanding, but this DirecTV DVR is incredibly hard to use or understand."
1,Nothing But Problems,"I've now had two different R15 receivers. The first one would ignore the remote, require nearly daily hard drive formats, finally wouldn't record.. along with freezing during watching television, Guide freezing, etc.My replacement, a second R15 now crashes daily requiring a soft reset. It also ignores the remote occasionally requiring another soft reset.I would avoid this product at all costs!"
1,Worse than useless,"Just my amen to the universal dismay.We bought 3 R15s. They worked fine for several months, but then started to go bad. We've had every bug mentioned by previous reviewers.When our living room R15 died, we lost 93 hours of programming. We received a replacement, but that started to go bad immediately.Our bedroom R15 has now died, and we lost 54 hours of programming.DirecTV is sending us two more replacements. We have no hope that these will work, because they will have the same crappy software as the earlier machines. DirecTV should be ashamed of foisting such garbage on their customers.If you have any option to using the R15 -- even just the old receiver-VCR combination -- I suggest choosing it."
1,Worst DVR ever,"Don't even try to convince yourself it's good, you still have a choice ...get cable. It's not intuitive and has a lot of bugs. One star because I cannot put 0 (zero)"
4,Working so far,"I rented an older model previous to the R15 that had problems freezing and stopping on us. Direct TV had me do a hard reset, which fixed the problem temporarily and then it began again. It was so severe, I called them up again and insisted they replace my unit, which they did (I had signed up for their protection plan). It came quickly and I sent the old unit back, which they paid for. This R15 is smaller than my old one, which I like; and so far, it doesn't freeze and stop. It responds quickly to the remote and I have no complaints. If the freezing starts happening, I will be sure to come back to update this review."
3,Screen saver from hell,"Reading the other reviews, I guess I got lucky. I never had any issues at all with the R15 not functioning as it should. My biggest pet peeve is the screen saver that comes on ALL THE TIME and you have to find the remote and hit a button to make it go away. I'll be in the middle of watching something and up pops the screen saver and I have to scramble to find my remote. Very annoying. I live alone and like to leave my TV on when I'm at work (I work nights) so that it looks like someone is home, but thanks to the screen saver, it might as well be turned off. DirecTV says there's no way of turning it off.I'm switching to Verizon Fios and back to my beloved TiVO, to which the R15 does not compare."
1,"Titantic, the Hindenburg, and the R15","Possibly one of the worst consumer products ever. To call the software subpar would mean to insult 90% of the buggy software out there. The UI was designed with a blind person in mind. The user experience they were shooting for must have be ""frustration, anger and hate"".Problem include, but are not limited to:* frequent lock ups* not recording show you set to record* not being able to set shows to be recorded* listing all channels, including the ones you can't use* slow to respond* badly designed remote control* poorly designed ff, rw, and play controls* poor customer service (boy they must be really over worked too!)* cannot replace the harddrive on your own if it dies* only able to recieve 2 signals* slow boot up time* poorly organized menus* crappy search* bad navigation commands"
1,Direct TV's R15 should be scrapped.,"We have been a direct TV fan for years. We have told all our friends how great Direct TV was. All that changed when Direct TV replaced the old DVRs with the R15. This machine has more mechanical and software issues then any 100 persons could list. It freezes, records only part of shows, blacks out and that is just 5 percent of the problems. If you love Direct TV and want it to survive, demand the R15s are scrapped and replaced with fully functional DVRs. If the R15s continue to be used, almost all Direct TV's customer base will migrate to cable. The R15 is not worth a penny!Do not buy the R15!!!"
1,Worst PVR EVER!,"I've owned the R10 and other Tivo based units. This unit, the R15, is by far the worst DVR of all time. DirecTV is doing first time PVR users a diservice by turning them off to the jobs of PVR ownership.It's slow.Impossible to navigate.Buggy.Crashes.Worthless.Be warned."
1,Directv R15 Defective Product,"I bought a Model R15 Recorder and it started turning itself off and I could not get it to turn back on. I hit the reset, reinserted the card and it still did not work. I unplugged the beast and left it unplugged for 15 seconds (hard reset) without any result. Directv replaced the unit and I have had a brand new one for about four weeks now. The new unit is now starting to turn itself off. This time, doing a hard restart worked but the unit is obviously verging on failure. Directv said they could do a hard drive replacement over the phone but I would lose everything I had recorded. That is like buying a new computer and having to constantly do a restore wiping out your hard drive. This product needs to be taken off the market."
1,I hate this POS (R15),"I hate this POS (R15)I Bought the R15 and was told it will be different from my HUGHES SD40 TIVO. Boy they are right!!The R15 is the worse POS I have ever bought. The system freeze and I have to reboot 3 to 4 times a day. One would think I have a defective unit, I sent this unit back to DIRECTV and they replaced it for another. Does the same thing!! I guess when the hard drive gets past 50% this is what happens.The unit doesn't record when you go back and forth on 2 channels like the TIVO did. When you record series you can not record the same program on 2 channels.I had to buy a refurbished Huges from e-bay I hated this so much.Bottom line, don't buy, lease or plug in the R15."
1,I cannot recommend this to anyone.,"I own one of these and would not recommend it to anyone, except someone I want to annoy. The record function works occasionally. When I do manage to record a program, sometimes I am greeted with a black screen when I try to view the program. The unit is very slow to respond and this can sometimes cause to user to do something unintended. There are 2 usb ports on the unit that are there for decoration it would appear as they have no functionality at this time. If this was simply a receiver it would work ok, but as a DVR it leaves much to be desired. For those people out there that would say to talk to DTV and have them send me a new one, I have and I am currently waiting to get my 3rd one and I have only had DVR service for 3 months."
1,"If I could do 0 stars, I would do it","Every bad thing that you've read about is true! We are on our 2nd one now. The first one worked for like 2 days, and then started to power up and power down all by itself. We got a replacement for it, and it worked for a while. However, it now just ignores recording shows. I checked the ""to do list"" one night and it showed none of our shows set to be recorded for another 4 days because ""no episodes were available"" even though I was watching the show at the time!!! Avoid it. Don't buy it. I'm looking for another R10 model and then I'll try to sell the R15, though I don't know if I could be that cruel. I may just chuck it out the window. Yeah, it's that bad!"
1,AVOID IT AT ALL COST,"I've been a DirecTV customer for 6 years. I've had a DirecTivo receivers throughout this whole period. Recently I got this receiver and I can not be more disappointed. I've always loved DirecTV's service, but this receiver is having me think about cancelling DirecTV service all together and switching to Dish Network, maybe even cable. Yes, it is THAT BAD. If you had any previous experience with Tivo, you will absolutely HATE this receiver. I wish I could assign this product no stars. It's as good as having a VCR, really. Actually, you are better off with a VCR than with this DVR. DirecTV lost a loyal customer and I'm sure they will lose tons more if they continue to offer this product to their customers. I am an IT prefessional, and I have never come across a product in my field of work that is worse than this DVR. I'm not going to go into the things that are wrong with this product. Plenty of the other reviews have done so, and it is all true."
4,Cool patterns and solid construction,Seems to be a nice product; solid construction with finished edges and closures to keep it in place even under strong wind conditions. We live in Chicago and need stuff to be tough to handle our intense weather extremes. I cannot give five stars until I see how it holds up over time. I am surprised this pattern is so nice; we are definitely glad we chose the banana leaves pattern!
5,ST. BASIL THE GREAT,"ST. BASIL WAS TRULY GREAT! HIS TEACHINGS RELATING TO CELIBACY AND THE MARRIED PRIESTHOOD SHOULD BE REQUIRED READING FOR ALL CATHOLICS! IF WE FOLLOW ST. BASIL RATHER THAN THE CURIA, WE MIGHT SAVE THE CHURCH!"
4,a complete season,"After being gone for nearly a year; I was finally able to see all of the programs episodes. Alot of them deal with the same equipment and the effectiveness is spotty, yet promising. At least someone is taking a professional and scientific approach to trying to find conclusive evidence of these mysterious creatures and happenstances. More or less the series is an updated version of an older TV series. If you're into the strange and spooky, this can help shed some more onfo on those subjects."
3,"MQ, Season 1 - A Letdown","I guess after reading the reviews I was expecting a lot more from this but I have to say it was somewhat of a disappointment. Not one of the shows in season one concluded with any proof of the creatures they spotlighted. The two episodes that held the most interest were ""Giant Squid Found"" and ""Russia's Killer Apemen""; Those two at least had a viable amount of historical info that was indisputable. The shows are well paced and and the look is appealing but a bit more form over content."
5,Monsterquest,I purchased the first season of Monsterquest for my youngest son for Christmas. He absolutely loves it!!!!! Great product and great service from Amazon.
1,White gold hoop earrings,"The wire on one of the earrings broke the second time that I wore them. I can put it back on, but it repeatedly breaks. If it comes off while I am wearing the earrings, I will lose the whole earring. The pair cost $59, and I expected better quality."
1,Didn't even last a year,"I really loved these earrings when I first got them. I wore them probably at least three times a week for the last year.Pros:* Not overly expensive* Nice size* Pretty (initially)Cons:* Clasp comes undone very easily, have almost lost them many times* Pretty thin, could easily bend or dent* Only lasted a year before the gold plating started to wear offThe earrings still don't look too bad from the front, but in the back, where they rub against my skin, the gold plating has worn away exposing the base metal underneath. I expected better for the price... I've only had them a little over a year.I am extremely dissappointed in the quality of these earrings. I have a smaller pair of white gold hoops that I alternate with these that I've had for well over 10 years, and have had no problems with them."
1,Very disappointing.,"Earrings were very lightweight, hollow, and the hoops were very thin. Not good quality, I could have done better at WalMart. I expected a lot better from Amazon.com, especially for $50."
4,Good value for money,I am very pleased with these. They are quite solid and a nice size. Not huge but not too small.
3,OK,"Arrived as ordered. Had to purchase some additional items to complete hookup. Works and I don't have to worry about bursting,"
3,"Enjoyable movie, poor edition","The basic problem with this DVD is the compression of the original Techniscope frame (letterbox) into Widescreen. This causes the image being absurdly elongated and people look taller and thinner than they should. If to this basic fault you add the lack of bonus materials aside from a couple of filmographies and trailers, and the absence of subtitles, you'll understand why I have dubbed it ""poor"". The same applies to the other titles in the collection. On the other hand, these are extremely scarce films and I doubt whether it exist another edition in the world, let alone a better one. Sobuy them if you want -- but be warned!"
4,"Excellent insight, but couldn't there have been more?","This is a great book for the Sondheim aficionado. I learned a lot about the technical aspects of his style. My only complaint is that Merrily We Roll Along is mentioned only briefly in the book. I consider Merrily to be one of Sondheim's three best scores, and its absence made very little sense. Further, all Sondheim musicals pre-Overtures are also absent (perhaps more understandable because I suppose Sondheim remembers those less and there was little time in the interviews). Nevertheless, for the hefty price I would have expected more info. Perhaps a second volume?"
5,Sunlite Bicycle Handlebar Shim Alloy Pair,"These are great! I bought a set for actually for a 2001 Kawasaki W650 motorcycle instead of a bicycle. The 1 set was large enough (approximately 2 inches wide) that I was able to cut them in half and make use of each half elsewhere. The fit and finish were exceptional. For such a low dollar investment, there is great value in this product vs. having to either spend tens/hundreds of dollars on custom handlebars and controls or machining existing ones. They are relatively pliable and adapt easily to your existing contours. The grooves add just the right amount of friction. In several months of nearly daily commuting since I've mounted them, not once have the bars, or controls for that matter, even given the feeling of shifting or coming lose. They're rock solid."
1,Not much to it. Super high level.,The first 7 of the 23 pages are legal stuff and a Table of contents. The rest of it is just high level bullet points. I got more information from Microsoft.com.
2,Far too many typos,"The basic strategy is not bad, but I found many typographical errors in the printed book. Most of these are systemic problems in the way certain Cyrillic characters are represented. There are enough errors that the book cannot be used by students working without an attentive tutor."
2,DISAPPOINTING,"A group made up of Seamus Blake, Tim Hagans, Kevin Hays, Larry Grenadier and Billy Drummond (add Mark Turner on some of the tracks) promises a lot, but this album sadly disappoints. Kevin Hays uses a Fender Rhodes on some of the tracks, creating the sort of funky mush you used to hear on albums by Eddie Harris. Other tracks are straightforward blowing in the contemporary vein, often adding a boppish sound. Recorded a year after his brilliant debut ""The call"", Blake seems to be looking for a new approach. Retorting to rather old-fashioned bebop and funky grooves, changing approach from one track to the other, creates an album which doesn't seem to know just what it wants."
5,EXCELLENT Purchase,"Recived item on time, and the VHS tape works perfectly.. and at a perfect price. Would buy from again... Pleased with the quality of the VHS tape.."
3,Mr. C Christmas in Ireland,"This VHS tape is fair and as many have indicated Perry Como is showing signs of age, but also the conductor is partially to blame for having the choir sing so loudly. To bad as you can almost feel Perry's frustration; however, he does carry off the concert very nicely and there only a few moments of difference between Mr. C and the Choir (in lieu of the 40 members they should have selected 10). At any rate, this was enjoyable and was to be his last concert (at least that I'm aware of)...and if only for that, worth endearing for the Holidays."
2,Painful to watch,"I purchased a used copy of this concert to give to my parents for Christmas. I decided to watch it myself (couldn't help it!) before wrapping it up! After viewing it, I am not sure that I want to give it to them. First of all, let me say that I have great respect and admiration for the talent that was Perry Como. However, this concert was extremely painful for me to watch. His singing voice was a whisper - and he frequently forgot lyrics and either hummed a little - or just stopped singing altogether! Embarrassing! I would only recommend buying this tape if you are a die-hard fan."
1,Only a small portion of the screen is viewable,"I am rating the steaming video, not the movie itself, as I was not able to watch this movie. Somehow the steaming video is only displaying the upper left hand portion of the screen. You can hear people talking, but only get to see a lot of walls and doorways. I tried viewing it on both my PC and TV, with the same results. I have not had this problem with any other steaming videos. I want my money back, or a corrected version of this movie."
1,Instant Video not watchable,"This is a review for the Amazon Instant Video version, not the film itself. The streaming video is not watchable on either my computer or through Roku because 1/3 of the screen is cut off completely."
4,A must read book,This is a must read book for anyone who wants to start a career in Cross language speech perception. It has almost all the basic information covered up and gives a realistic view of research in the speech perception area. A good book to learn the basic differences between theories and ideas of different people in the field.
3,it's nice,i just want linux books to get good name in linuxand one more thing i want to become a excellent netadm in linux environmentok thank you
2,"Good writing, but disappointing as a novel","Although McNeal is a fine writer, the characterization of this book as a novel is extremely misleading. I found the frayed story lines and disappearing characters to be quite frustrating. The ending is especially unsatisfying."
3,What Happened!,"I stayed up until 2 am reading the first part of this book and just loving it. Did the same person write the story after Randall and Marcy got married? Randall underwent an unattractive seachange. Instead of being a mixed up kid who does things you can understand and sympathize with, he becomes a mean, angry man for no discernable reason. Then he turns around again and becomes a loving husband and son-in-law. So what if his wife has to go around with an eyepatch the rest of her life? No problem. The shifts were just too great to work and the characters became unbelievable.I had the same problem as other readers with the lost characters, some of whom were interesting. And the ending! It's sure a good thing Dorothy met up with Doris Bailey to find out she still had a chance to ruin her life.McNeal needs to try again and write a whole book next time."
2,lack of coherent character development,"The writing is serviceable, but the book is either poorly edited (over edited?) or it was worked on and then set aside over a great deal of time. I think the author tries and fails to make us care about a variety of characters (a la Russo-Empire Falls) all of whom lack cohesion from chapter to chapter. Some characters are developed in one chapter, then forgotten about throughout the rest of the book. Different plotlines/character grids are developed and then abruptly dropped, and the main characters seem to enjoy mulitple personalities from chapter to chapter. Again, this seems to be an attempt to mimic the stylings of Russo, but in the case of this book, it is unsuccessful. All this book served to do for me was wish for a new Richard Russo book to read, something satisfying and complete. This book, while well versed perhaps, was neither satisfying nor complete."
1,"Goodbye, Goodnight; nice cover, poor writing","Am I crazy? I bought this book because of the glowing reviews quoted on the cover, and because of the groovy cover (I buy wine for its label, too, alas), but I found the writing amateurish and disjointed. The author seemed to enjoy superficial, ever-changing psychological insights into his characters - these facets seemed unrelated and often pointless. That, along with obvious gimmicks (parenthetical statements, overdone/overwrought/unrelated painting of emotional nuances - witness the skinny-dipping invitation, the slimy remark in the bar, etc., etc.) made me wonder if I was missing something. Could all those critics be wrong? I kept reading and, although the writing improved somewhat toward the end, the whole book left me asking ""Why did I read that, again?"" Who was the main character, and what kind of person was he or she? The transformations were pointless, arbitrary, and rang false. Read Poisonwood Bible, or maybe The Stone Diaries; save your money."
3,It's my hometown!,"I have a completely different look at this book because it was written about my hometown from age 12. My parents still live on a farm outside Hay Springs, NE. My mother knew the author. Some names are real, like the Superintendant, who was my superintendant. Osborne's grocery store....I went to school with one of the Osbornes. The roads and intersections. This book, though I thought it was lacking in literary merit, was a phenominal experience because I felt like he was looking at my town from a satellite and writing down what he observed! It is very true to life and all too real for me. It's worth reading to understand small town life....If you're from Hay Springs, email me!"
4,"small-town life, dead-on","This is one fine novel, and this reader hopes that it is just the first of many more to come from Tom McNeal. His eye and ear are just about perfect, and his depiction of Midwest small-town life (of which I can speak from direct experience) is dead-on. The novel is compassionate without ever lapsing into the sort of pastoral sentimentality that mars lesser fiction set in rural landscapes. McNeal manages to take a broad cast of characters and give each of them breath and personality. He's also a natural storyteller. What more could you want -- other, that is, than his next book?"
2,Good Night!,"Tom Mcneal must have spent SOME time in Hay Springs, Nebraska (which is the town Goodnight is based on), but you really can't tell by reading this book. If he wanted to truly capture the townsfolk of Hay Springs, he'd have to collaberate with Steven King because they are much more frighteningly stunted and boring than McNeal would lead the reader to believe. This book wanders and disappoints; Hay Springs even more so. If the town would change it's name, Good Riddance would be a much better choice."
1,So depressing,"I read Tom McNeal's book after finishing his other novel,""To be Sun Underwater,"" which I LOVED. When I find a good book by an author I'd not heard of before, I like to look at other books that he/she has written. Nothing like finding a new treasure! I have to admit that ""Nebraska"" was so DEPRESSING, full of dysfunctional characters, that I couldn't even finish- something I rarely do because surprises can come along in plots. Not this one."
3,Goodnight Nebraska,"An interesting story, however there were too many characters that were thrown into the story for no real purpose, or not developed enough."
3,A Solid Debut,"McNeal's debut is a solid entry into the literary world. His characters and settings are vivid and provide a solid foundation to the story. He does leave a few interesting characters along the wayside and makes us wonder what happened to them. For instance, I would have liked more closure or resolution for Randall's mother and sister. Randall discovers where they are late in the story, but we never really know what happens to them. McNeal starts an interesting plot with the triangle between his mother, sister and Lenny, and then he leaves it unfinished.I strongly agree with one of the other reviewers here who is annoyed by McNeal's use of parenthetical statements. Why not ditch the parentheses and just say what you mean? I hope he doesn't follow this style in his next work because it weakens his narrative.I hope McNeal continues writing because he has a lot of potential."
5,"compelling, sensitive, and provocative...will endure","This extraordinary novel will force the reader to examine the premises of his/her life, to observe more closely the various communities in which we live, and to cherish those virtues which enable us to love and adhere to others. Having finished the book last night, I am still viscerally upset by the conclusion and nearly overwhelmed by the myriad of themes, allusions, and images Goodnight, Nebraska contains. The central characters are utterly believable, and their flaws cause their virtues to be even larger. Not only is this a novel about community, it is an exploration of family, solitude, love, betrayal, and redemption. That this is a first novel is even more extraordinary. You will remember this work for many many months."
5,Darkly comic and deeply disturbing.,"I've been a fan of Tom McNeal's short fiction for years, and I've waited a long time for this book. Tom McNeal has the courage to create a character, Randall Hunsacker, without feeling the need to make him into your friendly next-door neighbord. A reserved and troubled youth (Holden Caufield meets Gary Cooper), Hunsacker takes us on a sometimes funny, sometimes disturbing tour of the problems and passions of small-town America.A couple of the respondents have complained about McNeal's depictions of Nebraskans, that he's made them extreme. But this is a book about extremes, extremes of passion and extreme desires for freedom. I live in Nebraska and I feel I know these people. Couldn't put it down, couldn't put it down."
2,entertaining but misses mark,"On the occasion of returning to my small Nebraska town for a 20-year high school reunion, I thought I could add to the experience by reading this book. I was disappointed. Factual errors were my first sense that the book was missing (e.g., a group leaving Friday AM for Lincoln to attend a University of Nebraska football game presumably to be played during the traditional Friday evening slot). But facts are easy to get right, feelings are much harder to capture and unless small town life in NE has drastically changed, the characters and situations are collectively unbelievable. It's all exaggerated / concentrated and consequently distorted. You may find one or two of these characters and situations only in a generation. It takes more than a few years of someone's life to develop, capture and appreciate this."
4,a fascinating read!,"I had trouble putting this book down but the downbeat ending with Lewis and Dorothy was depressing. Also it seems to be that there were loose ends like with Randall's mother and sister, Lucy Witt's relationship with Randall for example. so I can see that the novel was a joining of several short stories which the back of the title page does indicate. I thought the author did an excellent job of showing small town life, especially for teenagers growing up there."
2,Fair but not up to my expectations,"I was hoping for something like the only other album I have from him. Unfortuantely, this ""sounds"" flat and muddy. I can't say that I'm happy with this recording - at least I hope it's just the recording. I'll be move selective and cautious if I look to buy one of his CDs again."
4,Classics in Tommie Style,Mother Goose Rhymes and illustrations by dePaula the perfect combination. We have many nursery rhyme books but our favorites are the one by dePaula because his art work is so fresh.
3,Afro Latino Soul,"Is the garden which an uncle hears slightly noisy? I think that it is the title which the Japanese who is in the band kept, but"
2,Odd Flavor,"I will admit I am new to gluten free flours, but of all that I have tried this one has the strangest flavor and texture. It was really off-putting. I will probably not be purchasing it again."
5,Another winner from Evanovich,"The good news: Another great outing from Stephanie Plum, with plenty of laugh-out-loud moments. The usual cast of characters is here (Lula, Grandma Mazur, Ranger, Joe, etc.), plus we finally get to meet Steph's sister and her two children. A quick and satisfying read.The bad news: We have to wait a whole year for the next installment. Will she take her ""engagement"" to Joe to the next level, or will she finally find out if Ranger's as good as she thinks he is? I know I'm looking forward to finding out!"
4,"Another humorous installment, bring on number eight.","How does Seven Up add up? Everything you've come to expect are here: the trademark zany humor, inept bounty hunting, colorful secondary characters, and New Jersey community. Laugh out loud funny, a quick read, a good continuation of the series. Grandma Mazur is a scream, as always.It is my perverse reader's nature to want Stephanie's relationship with Joe Morelli to be settled. I won't give anything away, but suffice it to say that this book is not the conclusion of the series. I said something to Ms. Evanovich about her annoying proclivity for cliffhangers when she was down here and she laughed. She's found a formula that brings readers back for more. Fie on this cheap trick!...And bring on the next Stephanie Plum! ' )"
3,Well.......it's Stephanie...after all!!!!,"""Seven Up"" was another predictable installment in the ""Plum"" series. I must admit: Grandma Mazur will always be tops on my list...as will Morelli and Lula. Stephanie..well...she's a mess. Her sister Valerie needs to take her kids and VANISH before the whole town of Trenton goes under. As far as Ranger...well...it would take alot for me to break down and pursue him. I think I'd stick to Morelli, personally. I am sooo anxious to read the next book."
3,"Eh, nothing new here.","From the first page it was the same. Just a different crime to be solved. For crying out loud, throw some new guy in the mix. This Ranger-Joe-Ranger thing is getting old. Also, decide whether or not you are writing to people who have read the other six or just picked up the 7th on a whim. I mean, there's inside jokes for those of us who are hooked but loooong descriptions of ""the burg"", Joyce Barnhardt, 53 Buick, Stivas... for those who just started reading. It's too much. Be brave, try something new. Take a chance with the fact that you may alter Stephanie's ""story"" by having something uncharacteristic happen to her. Say, getting married or having a good hair day. Who knows, just not the same vanilla."
1,Painful experience,"I loved Janet's previous six audio books so very much, I bought them. I am now in the process of replacing my cassettes with CDs as I have listened to them over and over and over and they are wearing out.That being said, I HATED SEVEN UP and will not buy it. I regret that I cannot rate this less than one star (like maybe a negative five stars). It was boring and actually painful to listen to. Words and names were midpronounced as compared to previous books. The reader was AWFUL!!Janet, what happended? Have you lost your pizazz? I hope not. I live for your next releases. Please, go back to the previous readers (Lori Petty or Debbie Mazar). I don't know who CJ Critt is (I am sure she is a fine person), but she does not convey the Stephanie Plum we all know and adore."
4,A definite LOL!,I've read the 1 - 6 series and I think #7 is the best yet! I can't get enough of Gramma! She's the best. I would highly recommend this book for the beach or poolside! It's a great summer read that makes you feel like you're right beside her caught up in the zany action.
1,"Same old, same old...","Evanovich has run out of ideas, so she keeps repeating the same kind of unbelievable scenarios, over and over. Slightly different situations, but nothing you couldn't figure out the results to yourself. I loved her stuff in the beginning but the tiresome characters, wornout scenes and predictible endings lead me to say that I've read my last Stephanie Plum ""mystery"". P.S. Did she borrow Benny and Ziggy from Laverne and Shirley????"
1,New narrator ruins great series.,"My wife and I are huge fans of the ""Stephanie Plum"" mystery series by Janet Evanovich. We own the unabridged recordings of all of these books. Prior to SEVEN-UP, the narrator was Recorded Books C.J. Critt. She WAS Stephanie! The new person is laughably bad. All her characters sound like Fred Flintstone with a mouth full of rocks. We consider Books 1 through 6 to be prized possesions, and only the strict litter laws of our state kept us from throwing this tripe out the window of our moving car. we will continue to buy the print versions of this wonderful series but we will hear Ms Critt's voice as we read them."
3,Not her best effort,"I'll keep this short and sweet. I have been hooked on Stephanie Plum since I first read ""One For The Money"" and I've recommended the books to everyone. But.... this one was disappointing. It's almost as if the author's mind was elsewhere while she wrote this. There were some funny moments, just not the usual side splitting, tears in your eyes, can'tcatchyourbreath kind of laughs. Grandma had a few moments, though even she was substantially subdued. I won't give up on Stephanie Plum yet, but I have my fingers crossed that the next book will be more like Ms. Evanovich's first six efforts."
4,The reader doesn't measure up!,"I've listened to the first six Stephanie Plum books and absolutely loved the reader and laughed out loud while listening. Unfortunately, the reader for this book is just horrid, not a speck of the same characters in the voice as in the first six books. I hope this reader, Tanya Eby doesn't do anymore Stephanie Plum novels. Please give us the original reader back!"
2,silly trash,"I'm sorry I revisited the Stephanie Plum series. This book was just plain trashy. The characters have little sense of responsibility or loyalty. The ""engagement"" between Plum and Morelli is a farce, and Stephanie should slap some sense into herself. The heart aspect of the story was interesting and amusing, but not well developed.No more Evanovich books for me."
3,Guilty pleasure...,"Stephanie Plum is definately one of those guilty pleasures that you are almost embarassed to admit too. This is no ""genius piece of literature"", but it will fill a day at the beach with fun and the occassional ""laugh out loud"" moment! These are the perfect vacation books - not so deep that you can't put them down to go out on the town...you will be able to easily pick up where you left off!"
2,Bring back the narrator!,"Stephanie Plum novels are my favorite to listen to. This is my way of avoiding road rage and getting through the drive every day. I've grown accustomed to the sound of Steph and Lula and Grandma, but now after six perfectly read books we switch narrators! Not only are all of the accents different, pronunciations of names have changed. Am I the only one who listens? If the book gets and editor so should the CD. We've got a new reader for the eigth novel and it's waiting for me in the car. Let's hope for better listening on that one."
1,begging for a reissue of this tape!,"I've listened to the series in both abridged, with Lori Petty and unabridged, with CJ Critt. I prefer unabridged books, but enjoyed both Lori and CJ as narrators. I'm not even half way through the 1st tape of Seven Up, but I'm about ready to dump it like the other reviewers. I can't even rate the story because I'm not into it far enough because Tanya Eby's voice is like fingernails scratching down a chalkboard! I've actually had to cut my exercise routine short because I can't listen to that voice for more than 5 minutes. I was hoping that the book might have been re-issued with another narrator. Unfortunatley, Eby seems to have voiced both the abridged and unabridged versions of this story and it looks like I'll have to read the book and exercise to something else. Yikes!P.S. Have since read the book and recommend it over this tape even if you NEVER read books. No one should have to suffer Eby's voice to continue with this great series."
4,Another hilarious book from Evanovich.,"Come on! How can you resist the stories of the female bounty hunter from Jersey? This time Stephanie Plum is after old man Eddie DeChooch and you just can't believe his luck and the trouble he has gotten himself into! Mooner and Dougie are back, as is Lula, Connie, Vinny, Grandma Mazur, the two men in Stephanie's life - Ranger and Joe Morelli, and Bob the dog who eats everything and poops in Stephanie's arch enemy Joyce Barnhardt's yard. This series is hilarious from the characters to the situations they find themselves in. Its action, comedy and mystery all wrapped up in a bright cover.Enjoy!"
5,Stephanie Plum is a real treat.,"I just started getting into this series and this latest book is real treat. Stephanie is asked to pick up Eddy DeChooch for a failed bond and from there everything went from bad to worse. From Valerie and her daughters moving home and her sister wanting to be a lesbian to Grandma Mazure getting kidnapped, wrestling matches, stolen human hearts and numerous other crazy happenings this book never fails. I felt sorry for Joe Morelli the young cop and Stephanie but I'm sure they will work out their problems. I'm hooked on this series, but I will have to wait another year to read ""Hard Eight"" because I only will read the paperback books they fit on my shelf better. This refers to the paperback edition."
2,"Liked the book, hated the reader","Ok, so, the book wasn't the highlight of Janet's career, but it was still very funny and I enjoyed it very much. However, I always buy the audio version too. I liked Lori Petty, LOVED Debi Mazer, but please don't let Tanya Enby narrate another Stephanie Plum book. Ruined it totally. Next time I'll check before I pre-order the audio version. If it's Enby, it's a no sale for me. I love the series. PLEASE bring back Debi Mazer. She's worth a raise."
2,Disappointed...,"Too much reliance on humor (after all, one of Evanovich's strengths). The humor is not enough to compensate for the lack of plot and character development. Stephanie is well fleshed out, as usual, but Ranger, Morelli and Lulu are verging on caricatures. (Are we supposed to care who Steph sleeps with? Can't tell.)I also found that I really lost interest in the mystery itself. Plenty of laugh-out-loud moments, but overall a less-than-satisfying MYSTERY STORY."
3,Seven Again,"Unfortunately, I was fairly disappointed by this seventh book in the Stephanie Plum series. I really enjoyed the first six and so when the seventh was released I bought it and devoured it on the first day. However, compared to the others in this series, I felt that Seven Up was lacking a lot of the characterization that made me love the other books. I felt like both Ranger and Morelli were reduced to cardboard cutouts who only showed up to get Stephanie all hot and bothered and then leave again. And yes, there's another cliffhanger, but didn't we already go through this in High Five? I think that Stephanie is a wonderful portrait of a woman who is still working on figuring out who she is and what she wants from life, but I wanted to give her a little more credit for brains and intuition. I tthought that Seven Up was entertaining, but certainly doesn't measure up to the previous books in the series."
3,Please bring back C.J. Critt!,"I have a long daily commute and have listened to all 7 of the Stephanie Plum series - in order, I might add. The first six are beautifully performed by C.J. Critt, who captures the personality of the character and stays true to each. Where oh where did they find the munchkin who read Seven Up? Is that supposed to be a New Jersey accent? Does the woman know that ""R"" is in the alphabet? Did she bother to acquaint herself with the characters before portraying them?Her reading was so distracting that I could barely concentrate on the plot (which, by the way Janet, was rather thin...)The series has been entertaining, but please, bring back C.J. Critt!!"
5,"""Seven Up"" a 10!","When it comes to mysteries, no-one is as rude, raunchy and rowdy as Janet Evanovich. Once again she's offered up a fast-paced treat that's not just laugh-out-loud funny -- it's laugh-out-loud hilarious. But be forewarned: Evanovich and her bounty-hunter heroine Stephanie Plum are not for the prim and proper Miss Marple crowd. Plum and her many cohorts are not averse to throwing around the F-word, as well as sexual double-entendres (and some not so double). What else would you expect from a series that takes place in Trenton, NJ. Think ""The Sopranos"" mixed with a heavy dose of ""I Love Lucy,"" or vice-versa. Whatever. Just sit back with a beer and some powdered donuts and enjoy!"
5,Deadly Intergalactic Princess,"She's got a doughnut, and she's not afraid to use it. I've read everything from Janet Evanovich I can get my hands on, and this is still my favorite of her books. The sassiness of her characters really come out especially in this book. Playful, brazen characters and an outrageous and scandalous plotline are why this is on the top of my favorites."
4,a rare racy raunchy rollicking rip roarin ride!!!,"I don't think I have ever absolutely laughed out loud as many times as I did reading this rare tale... and, tucked under all of the hilarity is a pretty tricky plot with twists on the order of a Chubby Checker delight.The characterizations are as crisp and clear as prime Damon Runyon along with a knack for knames that is a killer...oh yea, and watch out for gramdma Mazur... she's roughly a diamond."
5,How difficult could it be to catch an old guy?,"You know for Stephanie, few and far between does she get the easy to catch FTA's! DeChooch is an old guy in a big white Cadillac -seems like it should be simple. But really? If it was, would we still be tuning in to read the next installments? The hillarious adventure just wouldn't be the same without a few run ins and near captures of the skip at hand. The crazy crew continue to keep me cracking up! It's getting more and more difficult for me to LOL in silence while reading Stephanie Plum in my daughter's karate class, where quite is expected, 1hr 4nights a week -this is a bulk of my reading time. I do enjoy people seeing me trying to contain myself and wondering just what it's all about. Find out for yourself -you won't be sorry."
3,Fun audio book,I like listening to audio books while I'm driving long distances. I get to hear the story in one sitting and the miles the melt away as I listen.
3,Stephanie ages quickly...,I did not enjoy the audio tapes of this edition. Tanya Eby's voice was too harsh and a strong accent that really didn't work for Stephanie. She also destroyed Grandma's character.I thought Stephanie had suddenly jumped into her late thirties or forties with the voice that was used for the tapes.
3,Not as good as the other six,"I have all seven audios. Lori Petty read the first three and she was Good! Debi Masar read the next three and she was Great! Tanya Eby read the last and she was Terrible! I had trouble listening to the cassette because of her ""voices"". I hope someone else reads number eight."
3,Recycling under pressure?,"I agree with the ardent Plum fans that find little new here -- long on the ""tricks"" (GrandMa Mazur, Bob the dog, etc.) that made the other six funny and very short on gripping plot; not to mention that we already had the ""bedtime"" cliffhanger once before too. Like ""P"" is for ""Peril"", ""P"" is for pressure -- seems these best selling authors just can't keep up a book-a-year pace and stay fresh. Not that I could either, but maybe it's time to take a lesson from Thomas Harris -- while maybe we don't have to wait 5-10 years in between books, a couple wouldn't kill us to keep up the quality. Before we get ""8 is Enuf"", I suggest Janet take a break and work harder on the story next time and let us find the humor with a little more subtlety.Funny how too much of a good thing gets old!"
3,Evanovich and Plum going downhill,"I anxiously awaited the 7th Plum novel since the 6th one was a such a riot. I should not have been in such a rush. The books were never much on plot, but that was forgivable because the characters were so much fun. This time, even with the addition of Valerie, everyone seemed to be doing the exact same things as they did in the last book(s). The action happens so fast - there's barely a reflective moment from anyone, including Stephanie. And we've been through the Morelli/Ranger thing before. They both had very little to do other than be part of the whole love-triangle thing. The most exciting part was Stephanie's mom deciding to go back to school and eating a whole cupcake instead of the broken ones. I'd like to see this developed more - maybe next time leave Grandma Mazur home and take mom out to apprehend an FTA! I know I'll read the next book, but will probably wait til it hits the library instead of buying off the shelf."
2,7-Up,"I am a fan of Evanovich. I loved her first five books and even rather enjoyed the sixth, but, to me, what a disappointment 7-Up is. It simply did not meet the standards established by the first six stories in the series. I felt Evanovich tried too hard to create comic and the result was ridiculous and even at times disgusting. I guess I don't think ill-mannered children and poop jokes are funny. What I dislike most about this book isthe absence of those laugh-out-loud moments the other books in the series had. Even Lula was sedate in this story.The story line was okay. The new characters were okay, too, but do we want to really know about erection problems? I think not. What did it really add to the story?"
2,Kinda boring,"This one just wasn't as good as her previous books. I found the plot boring, and it wasn't as funny either. Pick this one up at the library if you really want to read it."
1,argh!!!!!,is there a no star selection?I am sure this reader is a nice person but eghad!she is NOT up to the previous readers.Debbie Mazar & Lori Petty are fine actressess andcan pull it off. But Tanya Eby's baby talk is vomit worthy.
2,Humor is forced.,"I've waited breathlessly for all of the Stephanie Plum series and enjoyed them up until ""Six"" when I felt that some of the humor was over the top. Now, with 'Seven', I didn't even read past page 50 because the author has dredged up yet another mishap at the funeral home (we've been there before), and the books seem to be veering toward comedy with a little mystery, instead of a mystery with some funny moments. I think her humor in the last two books has been forced. More farce than the sharp humor shown in previous books. I enjoyed her writing much more when she wasn't trying to hard to be funny. So, I don't know what happened to Morelli and Stephanie...sigh."
5,SEVEN UP,S tephanie Plum returns in yet another humorous mysteryE ddie DeChooch is the object of her attention this time.V aliently evading capture is a variety of creative ways.E vanovich prvides us with the usual mayhem we've come to love.N ow it's a question of who will win the heart of StephanieU ncertainty abounds. Will it be Morelli or Ranger?P lum's a peach but Grandma Mazur's a gem.
4,Another great one!,"Janet Evanovich is one of the few mystery writers I buy in hardback, because I know a) I'll read it repeatedly, and b) I can't wait until the book comes out in paperback! This is another terrific read. Yes, Stephanie is growing up (but not too much). Yes, we've got another cliffhanger (but it made me smile). And the mudwrestling pit--what a great idea! I only wish that section had been longer. I've given Seven Up four stars, not sure why I didn't give it five...guess I'll have to go back and reread the others (again) to decide!"
4,Laughing to the altar--almost,"I laughed out loud at the wise cracking Steph and her zany gang. I think I laughed more this time. Bob and his bathroom habits never fail to amuse--and this time there is a howlingly funny scene or two at the home of the nasty nemesis Joyce. Steph's mom is so much more real this time, and she seems to be developing her own individuality. You can see that Steph actually is her daughter. I liked the hot love scenes with Morelli--this time they don't all end in interuptus, so to speak. But, I was disappointed at the ending. I hate to think Steph might do what it seems she will. Oh, no. Team Ranger will be happy. Can't wait until next June."
5,"more laughs, more suspense","I just discovered the Stephanie Plum series a week ago, amd finished up with running out to my nearest book store to buy this edition, #7. I can't say I was disappointed. I've been waiting for a little more action between Steph and Ranger and it looks like it's finally happening. Don't get me wrong I like Morelli too, I just think that a little competition will be good for him. The whole family is a hoot, including Rex and Bob. The evergrowing extented ""family"" is great too, I was hoping to hear more about Sally Sweet again though, maybe next time. Nobody can get in more predicaments than Steohanie, and if you are in need of a good laugh then I recommend you read this whole series. The only problem I'm having is that it took me less than a week to read the first seven books and now I have to wait a year for the next addition, bummer dude!"
3,"Love the book, hate that the narrator changed","I absolutely 100% recommend these books. And you will love listening to the first six with C.J.Critt. I laughed so hard with ""One for the Money"". And she really brought out Grandma Mauzer. But unfortunately Tanya Eby butchered the characters. She just wasn't Stephanie. I was so disappointed I almost cried. I tried three times to listen to it but couldn't even get through the first side. Oh well, I hope that the new narrator for ""Hard Eight"" is better. C.J. Please Please come back. Stephanie needs you."
2,Disappointed.,"It was the first of the Evanovich books that I read. I can't say I enjoyed it very much. Maybe I should've started with Number 1. The main character of Stefanie struck me as more or less stupid and totally overwhelmed with her job. There was nothing funny about her personality. The book dragged until the end. I was used to better entertainment from Sue Grafton's ABC series. That was one reason I picked up Evanovich. Unfortunately the latter couldn't quite cut the mustard.I have to say, though that reading the other reviews makes me re-consider. Maybe I should've started with No. 1."
3,Seven Up- series still tickles but not enough fizz,"Seven Up is the latest in the Stephanie Plum series. While Seven continues to provide the laughs, the characters appear to be getting rather flat. How much longer are we going to be baited with Stephanie's fickle libido? It seems by now her character should have evolved more. Nothing too serious since this is a light mystery series but shake things up a bit. Seven UP seemed to cover a lot of the same territory as previous books. The plot itself seemed muddled at times and not as finely crafted. (personal favorite- Three To Get Deadly) However, Seven Up does entertain and this reader remains hooked on the series."
4,Stephanie Returns!,"After anxiously keeping up with the progress of this book, I rushed out to buy it the day it was released and then immediately sat down and read it all. And, wow, what a read! These books just keep getting better and better. Though this installment isn't as funny as the previous ones (and it doesn't miss by much, mind you) it does show that Steph is growing up and maturing. She's not a static character and luckily Janet isn't keeping her ""the same old Steph."" She's starting to realize her strengths and weaknesses and I feel that she's beginning to ""come into her own."" This book had some moments that were a little bit darker than what Evanovich fans may be used to, but they fit in nicely with the developement of our heroine, and with the developement of the supporting cast. What sort of developements, well, you'll just have to read for yourself. On a final note, I *loved* Bob's scenes in this book. I still get a chuckle thinking about them."
3,I couldn't wait...,"After the build up of the past six books, I couldn't wait for it to come out in paperback to get my hands on this one. In retrospect, I should have waited. To be fair, it did have it's moments. I didn't laugh as hard as I had with the other books in the series, and there is a level of frustration I am feeling with Stephanie's character, but just like with certain story lines I watch on TV, I am still hooked on what will happen next. I recomend the book on the stunning ending alone, and I will be one of the first in line to see where Stephanie goes now."
2,Disappointed,"I listened with fascination to the previous six books read by C. J. Critt. The reading on this does not measure up at all. For example, Grandma Mazur sounds like a nice sweet little old grey haired lady, not the outrageous senior citizen we have come to love. Lula has faded into almost nothing. Let's hope that when (if) there is an eighth book that we get C. J. Critt back to read it. (This review applies to the audio cassette version.)"
3,"As funny as the rest, not as good of a ""mystery""","This book is somewhat of a letdown after the previous 6. As a humor story, it is every bit as good. As an actual story, it is a bit weak. The love triangle is beginning to feel a bit contrived and annoying rather than maintaining tension."
5,Funniest Author,"Janet Evanovich is the funniest author I've read. When you can laugh out loud while reading, well, that's a great book!"
