2,Lacks teeth,"Dinosaurs get too much press, let's face it. It was nice, for a change, to see some other prehistoric superstars get their due - but, sadly, this book doesn't do them justice.Instead of real animals we get B-grade movie monsters. All the sabertooth cats do is move from one scene to the next, slaughtering an amazing amount of people along the way. There's no personality to these cats that makes them realistic, or makes them scary. Is you want an idea of how this book should've turned out, read ""Ghosts of Tsavo"" by Philip Caputo, which is a non-fiction account of man-eating lions in Africa. Now that's scary.If Rovin just stuck to a more realistic picture of his monsters, this could've been a far more thrilling work. Remember, the best thing about ""Jaws"" is you could believe the shark.Well, that and the great human characters. Rovins strikes out on that department too. But I'll give him two stars to giving a little attention to an under-appreciated creature."
4,WHERE'S THE ASPCA WHEN YOU NEED THEM?,"THE IDEA HAS BEEN USED MANY TIMES BEFORE: SPECIES THOUGHT LONG EXTINCT SOMEHOW SURVIVES FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS UNSEEN BY MAN. THIS TIME IT'S SABER TOOTH CATS, THEY'RE NOT TRUE TIGERS FOR THOSE WHO WISH TO SPLIT HAIRS.THE CHARACTERS ARE PREDICTABLE-FORMER VIETNAM VET SHERIFF HUNTING THEM DOWN WHO STILL HAS A WAR TO FIGHT AND WIN THIS TIME, THE ""LOVE-INTEREST"" BETWEEN THE NEWS REPORTER AND THE SCIENTIST WHO WANTS TO SAVE THE BEASTS.ALL IN ALL IT IS FAIRLY WELL WRITTEN THOUGH AT TIMES I FELT IT DRAGGED. FOR THOSE WHO ENJOY AN EASY SCI-FI READ AND SEEING A CHARACTER BECOME LUNCH I WOULD RECOMMEND THE BOOK. I HAVE READ ROVIN'S OTHER BOOKS (THIS WAS MY FIRST) AND THEY'RE ENJOYABLE THOUGH NOT TOO HEAVY.BUT DO YOU REALLY THINK THE ANIMAL RIGHTS GROUPS WOULD JUST STAND BY WHILE A BUNCH OF WEEKEND WARRIORS TRY TO HAVE TARGET PRACTICE WITH AN ""EXTINCT"" SPECIES?"
1,There are too many propositions followed by adverbs.,There were too many pictures. Writing was very awkward
4,Bought for 9 year old...,Have an older son that enjoyed G.I.Joes for years. Hasbro had reissued the 3 and 3/4 inch heroes and I just had to give my younger son the same gratification. Getting to play with the same toys his brother had was a thrill for him.
2,Not impressed,"I read good reviews of this book online so I ordered it. We are naturalists and it sounded like the perfect book to encourage interest in nature of a preschooler. The illustrations were very nice, but I was not impressed with the story line. I found it boring and not very original. I sent the book back to Amazon."
3,MAROON 5,DIDN'T LIKE IT AS WELL AS CONCERT SONGS WERE FAMILIAR BUT ADAM LEVINE HAS A GREAT STAGE PRESENCE WHERE EVER HE IS
2,Only played back in stereo!,"I would expect any music dvd this day, and age, to playback in at least dolby 5.1! I was not able to accomplish that, but was happy to have a concert dvd by the group!"
3,good dvd,"This is a good dvd but I was expecting something more. I was a little disappointed, but it's still Maroon 5 music. How can you go wrong with that?"
1,Air chuck does not work,This is a simple product that should work as expected. The air chuck is faulty and without some luck you will not be able to get air out of tank and into any tire. With extreme pressure and me fiddling with it while sitting on the ground I can get a slow discharge into a tire if at all. I will try to replace the chuck on my own or look at another brand. I once had another one and had the same issue with one I bougth at Lowes. I have had this one too long to return and that would be expensive as faily big and very heavy.
5,portable air tank,Received the item faster than expected and was professionally packed. The only complaint I have is that the needle valve to the tank needed to be tightened in order for it to hold air. It was easily remedied by tightening the needle valve.
4,Good value for a decent high volume air tank,"As just about everyone else found, the air chuck is junk ... in mine, the center pin flops around like a drunken sailor and looks flat out useless.They should save themselves the hose and just ship the tank.But I was already expecting that and replaced it with a long spiral plastic tube and quick connect chuck.Otherwise it seems to hold pressure and the gauge, on/off valve and filler fittings work as expected.This is a nice, solid - BIG air tank for the money. That extra volume takes longer to fill but lasts you longer.Shipping was a bit tough, so if you can find it [or have it shipped] locally for pickup, it'd be an even better buy."
4,Lyfe Jennings Speaks Truth,"I think I walked away with the title of probably being one of the first people to get this cd when it came out. I was feeling it on a lot of levels. To me, his voice is raw. Not everybody can sound like Usher or Brian McKight and I liked that. As far as the songs, She Got Kids, Must Be Nice, I Can't and Hypothetically are all songs that makes you think as well as want to sing along to. My only problem is I could have done without the interludes."
5,This one's great!,"This is easily the best 60's music reference book.It covers all the obvious supergroups,but also the one-hit wonders & even some of the obscure garage/psychedelic groups.You can disagree with the star ratings for each records,but the reviewer tries to be objective & it's really useful for the casual user.Of course the reviews are a summary(how many pages would be enough to cover the Beatles or the Stones?) & the emphasis is in mainstream groups,so it's not enough for the serious 60's collectors (try ""a tapestry of delights"" for great lost U.K. gems or ""fuzz,acid & flowers"" for the U.S.A. scene),but for most music lovers,this is a must!"
2,Boring....and WHAT is she saying???,"I am (very) surprised at the number of positive reviews this vido has recieved. My 6 yr old is in beginner ballet and loves it. But this tape couldn't hold her attention for more than 5 minutes! The dance instructor has such a heavy accent, it's near impossible to understand her. What WAS understood wasn't spoken loud enough, my tv was at top volume. She is not upbeat at all and acts like she wasn't paid enought to make this video. Her attitude and tone of voice is all the same- dull. I am annoyed at amazon for recommending this. I will be dropping it off in the nearest goodwill box."
2,"Cute Cover, That is it!","I was amazed at the other reveiws giving this video such good marks. My four year old watched it twice. She had attended a dance class proir to a move and loved the circle work, foot work and stuff for preschool age. This was no where near what I thought it would be. I would not waste my money. I would love a refferal for a good one! As my daughter loves to dance."
3,"Great product, but LOUD","It has a lot of functionality for the price and is cold, but I can't believe how loud it is. Maybe all a/c window units are this loud (I've only had central air before), but since it's in my bedroom I wouldn't have purchased it if I knew about the noise. Most of this is due to the fact that ""low"" isn't that low - you can feel the wind on the ""low"" setting from 5+ feet away."
4,"Frigidaire FAA084P7A MS II 8,000-BTU Room Air Cond...",Easy to install. Cools O.K. but you won't freeze. Hope it lasts for years.... we'll see.
2,Am I confused or is it just too late at night to be reading?,"I found this book to be extremely confusing. I stuck it out and after finishing it I decided I really did not like it. I feel as though I was reading two entirely different books - one that was a supernatural Stephen Kingesque novel and one that was a coming of age chiller/thriller novel. Frankly I didn't ""get"" all the Parson character/Devil stuff. I agree with other customer's criticism that the characters were extremely underdeveloped - I was half way though the book and still flipping to the front to figure out who was whom. I can hardly wait to see who in my book club got through it and what they thought of it."
2,Confused and Slow,"Did Phillips even know what she wanted to write about when she started this book? She sets up an interesting situation and then proceeds to waste time with verbal gymnastics. What little plot there is is completely disjointed and moves at a snail's pace. There is no connection, no growth, no logic between the opening and closing of the novel. Furthermore, the characters are flat, unbelievable, and rather dull. Phillips introduces themes of violence, religion, sexuality, and family and never develops or connects a single one of them. At the close of the book the reader is confused, not because of the depth or range of Phillips' writing, but because the author herself was clearly confused as she wrote it."
5,Complete satisfaction,"I have worn the Bostonian Men's Eaton LoaferBostonian Men's Eaton Loaferfor years at work. The shoe has great quality and craftsmanship and lasts and lasts, is as comfortable as any of my casual shoes (which need a day or two to break in also), and never fails to gain a compliment from customers and co-workers for the refined classic look. My family recently decided to get me a birthday present and knew instantly what I'd like, and now I have another color to use with my wardrobe. My girls kid me about being so predictable, but when its comfort, quality, and dependability I need...I know where to go."
2,Choose another toy,"I really wanted to like this toy, for I like most Parents brand toys, but I should have read other reviews first. First time out of the box and about 6 of the magnets slid down the fridge. My son did like finding the magnets that fit on each card (puzzle-concept), but there is no excuse for a magnet school with several magnets that are faulty! I will probably write to the manufacturer and get the faulty magnets replaced, but for the same money or a few dollars more, my son has really been enjoying the Parents animal hospital toy, with lots of pretend play...if you're wavering, get that. Oh, and it's true that it's hard to fit all magnets and cards inside the box."
2,"Great concept, lousy magnets","As a previous reviewer said, these magnets don't stick on the fridge very well. I had so many that didn't stick that I called Battat, Inc. to complain. They sent me some more letters a few months later, but they didn't replace all of my defective letters.I should've just returned it to the store."
1,wu tang: shaolin style,I have just received this game to day it arrived quick as hell but the damn thing doesnt work.
5,Tight,"This is one of the best fighting games that I have ever played. It has good music, and great action."
4,good but could be better,"this game is what people were afraid of when they first wanted to release it as ""THRILL KILL."" the games controls are some what slow at times. but the graphic nature of the finishing moves {ie. ODB ripping the head off the opponant he just beat the crap out of} makes up for it. the only other problem and just a small one you can not change the camara angle."
5,Wu Tang Rocks!,"This game, quite simply, rocks. If you are looking for another Street Fighter clone, seek elsewhere. This orginal game is packed full of fun. For those who like gore, this game delivers. For those who have weak constitutions or children, the parental lockout is a sweet touch. The only drawback is that the story mode gets a bit monotonous. However, the fun that can be had from a four-player brewhaha of a versus battle more than compensates. I highly recommend this game to fighting game lovers everywhere. Oh, and the soundtrack ain't half bad, either. Wu Tang forever!"
2,Price Check,"$43...As I write my review the game is selling for $43. I sold my copy 4 months ago on here for 9.99 and it wasnt the lowest price. What the heck is going on here. Clearly the folks paying the silly price have not seen the gameplay or read a correct unbiased review. I purchased my copy on clearance (I was the original owner) for 1.99 back in the day and even then I thought I overpaid. The storyline is vague, the characters are too similar and from what I could stand...the same scene appears to take place with different baddies over and over again. And this game is $43??The definition of insanity..."
5,Great book,"We used this book for a women's bible study. Though the chapter was short, the content of the book was great."
2,Sagwa Coloring Book,"I was disappointed that the Sagwa Coloring Book was not designed to accompany the Sagwa the Chinese Siamese Cat book. Instead, it was designed to accompany a Sagwa TV series, which I hadn't known about when I ordered the coloring book. The coloring book was listed along with the book, and nothing was said about the fact that the coloring book didn't go with the book. I'm delighted with the book, but disappointed with the coloring book."
5,Very nice truck cover,"Really like the truck cover. Looks really nice, only thing is i wish the decals were for the inside so they don't get scratched. Other than that. Definitely worth the money. Especially if you are a Grave Digger fan"
5,Practical information for Healers and Martial Practitioners,"I wanted to write a quick review to anyone that is interested in being able to have the tools to heal oneself and others without having to become a doctor. I am a Licensed Massage Therapist and I loved the information that this book offers. The information on chinese herbal medicine was worth the cost of the book alone. It covers acupressure and some basic massage and tuina, chinese therapeutic massage, for injuries that aren't serious enough to warrant a trip to the medical doctor. I believe that everyone should have at least a basic level of first aid knowledge and this book offers some of that first aid knowledge, from a chinese medicine perspective, and more. I have recommended it to all of my fellow martial friends and now recommend it to you."
5,Awesome,"Fantastic book for anyone serious about learning how to make their own traditional remedies. There is a section at the rear for rehabilitation exercises as well that has come in handy more than a few times in suggesting ways to provide relief for friends or family. I didn't count on that section being useful at all, so it was a nice bonus."
1,doctors outfit,"when i bought the outfit there was no size chart that i saw.the outfit was too small,the button fell off the first day"
1,Works great....,"If you like the feel of lipstick in your hair. Seriously, I tried to style it after using this on the grays that are at the forehead hairline, impossible. It says not to get it on your scalp. Well when your grays grow from the scalp, that's a little difficult. My main reason for this purchase was for in between colorings, that means it's going to go on gray ROOTS. Anyway, I have long, straight, medium brown hair so I pulled it back in a ponytail and hoped that would make it less noticeable. In the end I washed it out of my hair, off of my scalp and waited until the next day so I could color them as usual."
5,Fascinating!,I thoroughly enjoyed this all too brief book. It's very engaging and eye-opening for a goy in 2013. Lovely little read.
3,A Catholic Book That Made Me Act,"This book is a fun, quick read, with a really good handle on the struggles of living a holy life. The redemption and conversion at the end inspired me to go to confession.Jonah's neighbors are people you've probably met, and maybe even had arguments with. The former 60's radical who lives and agnostic life and longs for the old days of protests and social action committees. The evangelical protestant who knows a few parts from the Bible really well, but who can't argue without sticking to those few excerpts, and who likes the little tracts with comic book frames that show how the Catholic goes to hell.And just like the surprising things that happen to Jonah Christopher, after I read the book, a priest showed up almost out of nowhere and he was willing to hear my confession.I don't promise you a priest will show up if you read the book. But it will probably make you want to go find one."
4,The best thing to come out of Chicago (after my Wife),"My Mother used to say that ""no one likes a smartass"" - Sorry Mom but I dont agree; not when the smartass in question is Cecil Adams. Here is a man who clearly loves to confound us with his wide and deep knowledge and has an engaging way of keeping the ""teaming millions""on their toes. I secretly suspect that he gets a little help in his research but hey, who am I to quibble. This is great light reading - informative and interesting and the best thing to come out of Chicago (since my Wife)I bought this book ( and some of the others in the series) for my daughter but read them first and enjoyed them so much that I kept them for myself. Dont worry , I'll let her borrow them from time to time So try this book - you won't regret it"
3,Nice except for charging mechanism,This mouse is very sensitive but is adjustable. The only problem I have is that the charger only charges when the computer is on. There is not even a place to plug in an adapter you purchase separately.
2,"In time, wheel becomes too stiff to operate","I've had the mouse for over a year, and it was fine, except for the imprecise scrolling. It was sharp and quick.But now the wheel will barely move. Additionally, the clear material that makes up the wheel is disintegrating, ""rubbing-up"" the way rubber glue does. The is no apparent way to take the mouse apart to see if there is a way to free up the wheel.I can't believe that this technology is being made useless because of something as simple as the poor design quality of the wheel. And because of that, the mouse, charger, and USB receiver are headed to the landfill after a very short life. What a waste of resources."
2,Comfort with a cost,"This mouse has a very comfortable feel to it but does come at a price. The mouse is indeed rechargeable but when you need to recharge, it begins to be very annoying when the mouse will not sit on the docking bay right and charge right. It is also very difficult to keep it charged because any movement where the mouse is plugged in at will know it off."
1,Very disappointed,"I should have listened to one of the other reviewers regarding this item. At first I was pleased because I have big hands and this is the first wireless mouse I've ever used that feels ergonomically correct. However, all the pros of this mouse are immediately negated due to the fact that it refuses to seat correctly in the charging pad. Very poor design. DO NOT BUY!"
5,Review By BBC Radio,"""An invaluable and inspiring book full of heartbreakingly personal insight, meticulous research and tips on breaking the bully/victim cycle."""
3,"Good Saw, Bad Fence","I have only owned this saw for about 1 week.i was happy with the performance of the saw, good amount of power, easy to assemble.After a week of useing it the fence bracket (the part that clamps to the rail) cracked.unhappy i called delta to see if i could buy a better fence (uni fence or biesemeyer) they told me they could not do that and the only way i could get the broken part is wait and they were not sure how long it was going to take, because it is backordered from china!if i could do it all over agian i would save more money and buy a better model."
5,Great book,"This book is one of my favorite. It does a good job of showing that God's general revelation to man exists in many cultures independently. The evidence is compelling. My conclusion is that the notion and understanding of God is something that transcends culture in general. It must not be the case that the notion of a monotheistic God developed out of any single culture, but rather is shown to exist in many independent cultures. Now, God's special revelation seems to have been communicated through a specific culture(s). However, God's general revelation seems to be independent of culture, which is what we would expect from the reality of God. The evidence tells me that God isn't something made up in our minds. Rather, God is a reality that has an affect on our minds and being. This is consistent with a God that transcends culture."
5,Interesting Book,"I've heard bits from this book for years, but I'd never actually gotten a copy of it myself. I finally bought it and it's very interesting and a bit shocking. I study classical Greek and Latin literature, so I am mostly familiar with polytheistic religion and a strand of intellectuals who arrive at monotheistic ideas of a god who must be very different from anthropomorphic representations. I found this book extremely interesting in that there are quite a few people groups around the globe who have monotheistic beliefs with expectations and prophecies of a future message from the one true God. One group was even awaiting a man from the West who would bring a book containing the message from God about his Son. I would recommend this book to anyone, whether or not you identify as Christian. The evidence given in this book needs to be explored by anyone who is interested in issues of culture, belief, and anthropology."
5,Great Book,"This is a great book to inspire missions. It exposes God's heart for the nations since He created them. Don Richardson has a passion for the Lord's work and he shares it with the reader quite well. It is very Biblically sound as well. He looks at Scripture to form his opinions instead of using Scripture to back-up his own ideas. If you read it, you'll love it."
5,Classic Work Sampling God's Revelation Through Time and Culture,"This work is of course not Scripture, and the author makes it clear that there are some factors open to interpretation, but when you are done reading this well researched and presented work, you will be convinced that God is at work revealing himself. Even though I did not agree with every point made, I feel that in general Don Richardson presented well the different revelations and cultural understandings of God, which were distinctly preparing people to meet the only true and living God."
4,Provacative View of the Vietnam War,"Michael Lind would seem like an unusual person to reinterpret the titanic struggle over Vietnam. He is a writer, poet and left-of-center journalist who feels that despite the enormous cost in lives and material and the deep flaws in American policy, the war still served a purpose. Lind views the war as part of the Cold War and feels that we were sure to lose some battles in the fifty-year campaign to contain Communism. He divides the war into two distinct phases, an overwhelmingly guerilla insurgency in the years before 1968's Tet Offensive, and a more conventional, territorial land war that began after Tet. Lind believes that the strategy employed in the first phase was horribly misguided, and that afterwards, Congress and the American people had lost faith in the entire sorry affair. The Necessary War is a well-argues polemic that challenges conventional wisdom."
5,Will Likely Change the Way You Think,"Reading some of the negative reviews of this book has only strengthened, in my mind, my belief in Lind's argument. The people who dislike it dismiss it as saying that it is defending the indefensible, or excusing America's Cold War policy, etc., etc.What many of them don't deal with is Lind's well-written defense of America's Cold War policy - that stopping the spread of totalitarian communism was more important than only supporting democratic regimes.Lind succeeds not only in providing a justification for Vietnam and the level to which America intervened, but in providing (in my mind) startling revelations about Bobby Kennedy and in making a sound case that Johnson was a better CinC than Nixon.The book also contains fascinating information on the history of the anti-war movement in the United States.For realists, this book presents arguments that simply must be dealt with."
4,The best and only of its kind,"This is truly a must-have for anyone who is learning to crack a whip - try learning without it and you'll end up lashing yourself half to death. Like moms always say, you really CAN put an eye out with that thing. Everything is covered, from different types of whips, to safety precautions, to illustrated step-by-step instruction on different cracks and combinations of cracks. Common errors are included for each and every crack, as well as how to correct them. As a novice whipcracker, I doubled the number of cracks I could perform the VERY SAME DAY that I got this book. You won't find another one out there like this."
3,Won't teach you how to do impact play,This book is great if you want to simply learn to crack a single tail whip and some basic wraps for show only. However if you want to learn how to use a single tail whip for impact play this book gives you no information on that subject.
4,THERE ARE OTHERS,"THE DELTA 1/2 INCH BAND SAW BLADE IS THE BEST SIZE TO DO WOOD CUTTING. THIS SIZE LASTS LONGER THAN THE 1/4 INCH SIZE DELTA . NOTHING WRONG WITH THE BLADE; HOWEVER, THE SHIPPING DEPARTMENT OF THE DELTA COMPANY NEEDS TO IMPROVE THEIR PACKAGING SYSTEM. IT WAS MAILED TO ME IN A SMASHED UP FLIMSY CARDBOARD BOX. WHEN THE MAILPERSON DELIVERED IT, THE BLADE WAS STICKING OUT OF THE DAMAGED PACKAGED BOX. IT DID NOT EFFECT THE BLADE. IT WAS THE MANNER BY WHICH IT WAS SENT THAT BOTHERED ME."
5,Songs for sing-alongs for slightly warped families,Have been getting counseling from the Therapy Sisters for years. Don't plan to get well anytime soon as the treatment is just too much fun. Pachebel's Tantrum is especially appropriate for our holidays. Have been waiting for the reissue of this cd for some time.
4,Not the best in the series,"I like the Vampire Hunter D series and it's a solid title, some of the differences between character powers/abilities seems kind of odd but overall i like the series and if you liked the first two books you will enjoy this one as well."
5,Inspiring Book!,"Surviving Cancer is a remarkable book with practical, user friendly steps to use toward wellness This book blends traditional medicine with complememntary techniques and can be used by anyone dealing with any kind of challenge.This book certainly deserves the nomination it just received as one of the ""Four top Health books in the country.!"
5,I'm Impressed!!,"I really loved these tracks. The band is a mix between the ""Brand New Heavies"" and ""Jamiroquai""."
4,Woooooo!!! Alright!!!,"I caught these boys live one night after the first two tracks I was a customer. They are the real deal! Much in the vain of Ten City from the late 80's this group has a great feel for lyrics and melody. While not every track is a club classic this CD is better than most compilations you will find. Not for nuthin', this CD is as good as any mainstream R & B or ""neo-soul"". Much respect and success to Tortured Soul. Quite an Introduction it is.Best 3 Cuts...#2 How's Your Life?#4 Fall In Love#10 If You Wanna Feel Alright...but for pure chewing satisfaction......see them live! They are a REAL 3 piece band with REAL instruments and the music comes even more alive. Especially ""I Might Do Something Wrong"""
4,Excellent Musician's covering classic favorites,"If you are a fan of any of the members of Neal's solo projects, you'll enjoy this collection of cover songs that they recorded over the years. This really shows the range of Neal's vocal abilities and as always gives Mike Portnoy a chance to let us know how the drums should have been played.I do recommend this CD to anyone who enjoys Spock's Beard, Dream Theater, Transatlantic, and obviously Neal Morse's solo work."
3,Near miss....,"Ugh...faithful renditions of every song instrumentally...sometimes ""too"" faithful. Don't get me wrong, I love a good cover and there have been a lot of good ones. However, as much as I respect Neal...I don't like his voice on the majority of these covers. One begins to wonder about an artist that feels the need to do a recording of nothing but covers (if I walk into a store again and hear Rod Stewart crooning a remake of an old torch song, it'll be too soon!). Keep the covers to the occassional odd extra song on a new material release or in concert...nuff said!"
5,Momaw Nadon's Distant Cousin,"This is the Power of the Force 2 version. In 2006 Hasbro made an updated version of him. But they look so different that I use them as 2 different Ithorians. He has swivel neck, shoulders, waist and hips. He comes with an awesome blaster. I know a lot of fans have cried foul because Ithorians are supposed to be pacifists. But Ben said, ""You will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy."" So, I like the scuzzy and villainous blaster wielding version better!"
4,Eloquent & Noble Tchaikovsky,"This is not bombastic & over-emotional Tchaikovsky performance of Stokowski or Svetlanov, but vividly captured & eloquent performance with noble restraint. Pappano's experience with operatic works is evident in each work, masterfully building up drama and intensity, for example in R&J Overture and Francesca. 1812 Overture's choral part has lovely subtlety as well as glorious sonority. Only drawback is that the finale is rather flat, with all percussion instruments muffled in the background, and bass drums are used instead of real artillery. Ormandy (choral version) and Solti's recordings of the work is far more powerful and exhilarating."
1,Not compatible with Windows Vista,"I was very excited to get this software for my 7 year old. We tried loading it several times, but it isn't compatible with Windows Vista. Very disappointing!"
1,Bum disc,"Although the packaging and webpage advertised it was compatible with xp, it is not. Disappointing gift we bought for my daughter for Christmas. So wished it would work as we've seen nothing but great reviews!"
2,Check your system requirements before buying,Loved the idea of this software and bought it for my daughter's birthday. She was thrilled but it won't load onto her computer. It seems StoryBook is a 16-bit where her laptop is 64-bit - incompatible. There appear to be free downloads out there so we'll check those out.
2,They didn't even spell the name right.,"If these fellows want to make records that sell, they should at least try to learn their instruments and then write real songs. I am all for freedom of expression, but even that right can be abused. I hope by now they came to this realization. Maybe then a major label will offer them a contract. Wish ya luck dudes!"
4,SERIOUSLY VERY VERY GOOD STUFF,"I saw the video to ""A beautiful Lie"" on the iceberg... I didn't know it was Jared Leto's band etc.. I just thought it was a cool sound... It's really up there with the big stuff... I am surprised this is under the radar, it's probably the best I've heard in this genre... I know this is going to sound a bit much: it's right up there with U2... it really is."
4,Imaginative biography of a Great Woman,"The muse, the inspiration for the great Athenian Pericles ishis female companion Aspasia. How did she learn to enchant and enrich the intellectual and creative men of her time? Taylor Caldwell delivers a rich and powerful study of one of the most fascinating women in history. This book would make a terrific gift to teenagers interested in intelligent role models. Recommended. In fact, I think it is Taylor Caldwell's best piece of writing."
2,Not up to the caliber of Ferguson's prior efforts,"What else can I say?This book is extraordinarily dry and verbose. There is very little ""alternate history"" here.It really is best described as a work about other works of alternate history, aka Stephen King's ""Danse Macabre"".As a big history buff, I did not enjoy this and the last few chapters were forced reading."
2,"Interesting topic, uneven quality","The book is an interesting attempt at answering the ""what if"" question in selected historical events. The only problem I find is the uneven quality of the essays. The best by far is Ferguson's paper on the First World War. Some essays are almost boring. The essay on Nazi England is just an overview of the people who would be sympathetic to or aligned with the Nazis. It does not provide any interesting arguments. If you are very interested in history buy the paperback edition. It is not a book worth spending too much money on."
1,No Sleeping here,"Don't I repeat don't get this air conditioner. I know people think hey its an AC its suppose to be loud, but no. This item is beyond loud. The second we turned it on I was like are you kidding me. Don't expect to get much sleep. We have to blast our TV just to hear it. Also it rattles every now and again. I checked the frame and everything seems fine. Since we already opened the box we weren't able to return it to our local PC Richards. I always put this AC on 74 degrees energy mode because I cannot bear to hear it the whole night. It drives me nuts every day I pray that my BF gets a new one but he wouldn't since it was a hassle to get in the window in the first place. I suggest you do your home work on ACs before buying as of now Frigidaire acs seem to be the loudest. OH how I wish I would have gotten a GE."
3,UPS must have been rough with this one,"This was a heavy object, and should of just went to lowes because the fan housing was broke when this ac arived, Looks like a lemon, appliances should be bought local"
2,Accaptable but not great,It came with a large dent in a side panel which collapsed the louveres. There were also dented blades in the condenser back.Although it is reasonably quite in the installed room every other place in my house resonates with a loud hum. Otherwise it workes fine for the way I use it.
2,Karajan Should Have Stuck to the Music....,"Compared to other ""Das Rheingold"" DVD's I have seen, this one is a disappointment. Karajan may have been a superb conductor but his staging of the action was hammy, clumsy, and amateurish. Then you find out the the vocal track and the visual were recorded four years apart; the aggregate impression is that of a mediocre filming of a very routine performance.Of the singers, the best by far are the Loge of Peter Schreier and the Fricka of Birgitte Fassbaender. Thomas Stewart is stiff, the other gods are lackluster (possibly stifled by Karajan's penchant for total performance control), and the first scene in the Rhine is very stilted and lacks animation.Unless you really want to hear Schreier ""play against type"" as a sly yet tuneful Loge, avoid this. De Billy, Levine, and Boulez all lead better representations of this opera; de Billy's, for example, is a lot more fun to watch, and his Loge (Graham Clark) is even better than Schreier!"
4,Long Read for a Short Novel,Loved the novel and loved the story. There was too much inside British stuff in the novel for a Houstonian like me to get the irony of.
3,Re: bank encrypting,"IE will not connect to my online banking website due to the issues mentioned in previous reviews. Interestingly enough, Avant Browser will. There are several screens you have to go through, but you can reach your banking web site in stealth mode."
1,My review,I purchased this gun in the hopes that it would spray latex house paint. I had no luck at all. I spent more time playing with it trying to get itto work. I finally gave up. I gave it away to a buddy at work and it tossed it in the trash after 2 hours of playing with it. I would suggest that anyone wanting to paint a house invest in a airless unit and stay away from this sprayer
4,Nice job,"This is a great little product that is perfect for a situation where you just need to get the tub/shower clean, though it seems a bit much for daily cleaning, especially when one considers there are only four pads in a package. This is for heavy duty situations. But it does the job!It's a simple idea, little more than your average scrubbing pad that includes soap. However, there are no harsh chemicals, and the pre-soaping is quite mild so you're not left with even more soap scum. There's enough soap to do the scrubbing, and very little rinsing I had to afterwards. Really, it's the perfect combination of scrubbing and soap without trying to figure it out yourself.It's a great little product for a good price."
2,Malawi pack & play,Cons:This pack & play is heavy and we never have been able to pack all of the components back into the bag. The music is harsh and we never use it. The vibration feature is loud once you hook it on to the side. Never use that either. The bassinet floor is bumpy and uneven once the baby is in there.Pros: Cute design and nice changing area. I like how it holds the diapers and wipes. A unique feature.
2,Disappointed Buyer,This item seems really good on display. When we got it home it was hard to set up. The basinet feature is uneven and seems uncomfortable for baby. The entire music box on our unit did not work. We received this item as a gift and don't have a proof of purchase to return it to the manufacturer. My first child's pack and play from kolkraft was much better.
1,poor product with horrible customer support,"I know how to set up a playyard, and this is the worst one I've ever dealt with. The rails don't lock. The last time I tried to set it up, I had to use so much force that I broke the entire wheel unit off (and I went rolling across the floor). When I tried to order a replacement wheel unit, I had to pay with a money order (they don't accept credit cards--maybe because you can dispute claims with a credit card), and they wouldn't accept a return of the part they sent me even though they didn't send me the part I asked for! Buyer Beware! I'll never EVER buy Baby Trend again (I had a BT stroller and the wheel won't stop squeaking)."
1,Not well constructed,"My mother bought me this bassinet/pack and play for my 2nd born. I have used many versions of the pack in play (I have a 5 year old as well) and have to say that I thought the Baby Trend version was really aweful.When we were putting it together the first time, we noticed the vibration mechanism did not work. I calld baby trend and they sent me a new one, no questions asked. THe replacement broke after 3 months with VERY lite use. The Matress is also oorly contructed. Before my baby reached the weight maximum of the bassinet attachment, it started to bow in the middle. Also, the ""slats"" that make up the matress do not seem to stay put and end up overlapping. This tends to make it rather uncomfortable for baby. I would not recommend this product to anyone. I have use GRaco pack in plays in the past and wished I had gotten one of those instead."
3,Great product for non-travelers...,"I fell in love with this play yard online, and love it even more now that I have it!!! The colors and all the accessories are wonderful. The only problem is that it is a bit on the heavy side to take around with you. I would not suggest travelling with this play yard. Also, being a first time mom, I actually read the instructions to put it together. HUGE MISTAKE!!! The instruction manual for this play yard is too hard to follow. I pretty much referenced the picture on the box instead. Putting it together that way was so much easier."
2,not what i expected,im due in march of 06 and got this playpen as a babyshower gift i loved the colors (green and blue) since it matched the babys room..but putting this thing together was the hardest part it took my husband around a hour to put it up and there was parts missing like the battery door and the things that clip the organizer to the playpen..and i dont see how this thing can be considered portable?? with our 2 year old son we had bought the clarion graco playpen its similar to the colver one and i loved it.. it only took 1 min flat to put up..and never had a problem
5,Absoultly love this product!!,"When I first saw this, it cought my eye right away and I knew it was the one I wanted. However, I then started reading all the reviews, and found out good things and bad things about the product so I was kinda sceptical(spelling) about buying it. I wanted it for something easy to pack up for nights to Grandmas house and a few reviews that I read, said that it was hard to put together, and I didn't want something I had to fight with. So I ended up getting it anyway. I LOVE it! I put it together as soon as I got it, by myself, with no help, and I usually fail putting things together. It was sooo easy, yes there's alot too it, but it's very easy. There is more green in it then you'd guess from the picture, but I still liked it, it's very nice, I'm so excited to be able to use it for the first time. So all in all the color thing is the only thing I'd say to keep in mind when thinking about buying it. Everything else about it is just perfect:)"
3,Good but not great,"This game could have been so much better if it had more animation and more...incentive to play. as it is, you get no reward for winning a tourney, you don't see anyone when you play...VP2 can get quite boring at times. It does have excellent graphics (for pool) and the physics are eerily accurate. If you're a Johnny No-Mates (like me, sadly), it gets boring. Perhaps if you had someone sitting next to you, playing the game with you, it'd be more fun.Another note: Virtual Pool 2 can be extremely difficult. If a little kid or someone w/ little patience were to pick this up, things could get broken due to missed shots."
2,For summer only,"This tent is VERY easy to set up. That's the only plus however. The rain fly acts as a giant wind scoop and makes any breeze at all blow right into the top and down onto your face while you are laying in the tent. No way to close off the vents. Not a negative if its hot out but otherwise it sucks.So if you only play camp in summer then it's fine, it will keep the bugs off of you, otherwise spend more (maybe a lot more) and get a real tent!"
1,Cramped and Rainy,"I suggest not purchasing this item. I'd rate it at zero or less if I could. I heard great things about this tent, but they turned out not to be true. Once I put my air mattress inside, I could barely fit anything else. When I'd unzip the door...there was my bed. Absolutely not enough room. Plus, it happened to rain quite a bit while camping and I ended up sleeping in the car! This tent leaked like crazy."
2,Misrepresentation of product,"This DVD contains four classic TV shows of Sherlock Holmes from the 1950s.None of which star Christopher Lee as advertised. It is a poor quality transfer from an apparently deteriorated master. I have bought worse, but not recently. Don't waste your money.Golden Years of Classic Television: The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes Vol. 1"
1,BUY SOMETHING ELSE!,I bought this toy for much less than the $50 price tag and still think that I did not receive any value for the money! My son LOVES Pokemon and so I bought this for his birthday. It has NEVER stayed together for more than 2 minutes at a time when he has tried to play with it and he has given up and left it in a pile in the corner of his room.
3,I am pleased with this purchase,"although the item is not worth the 50.00 the stores are charging for it, my 4 year old son loves it. He plays with his pokemon figures all the time and we all battle with the dome. It was worth what I paid for it because he loves it. it is not the most durable item but he could care less."
2,"Lots of Fun, at the Right Price","We bought this for my son in December 2007 and he is having a blast playing with it, but it is very flimsy. Pieces fall off easily and I am putting it back together about every other day because my 2 year old isn't as careful with it as my 5 year old son. At a retail price of $50, I would definitely not recommend it, however we got it thru Amazon at 70% off, and at that price I would buy it again because both kids do enjoy playing with it."
2,Cheap piece of junk,"This is the only thing my 7 year old son asked Santa for, so of course Santa had to bring it. I agree with all the other reviews. Cheap, difficult to put together, it falls apart with the slightest touch, we had to tape the plastic parts together with strapping tape. My son loves Pokemon, but he didn't even play with it for five minutes before realizing the same things that I did. At least we didn't pay a lot for it, we found it on sale for $20."
1,Worst toy we've ever bought. Period.,"I completely agree with the other reviewer. Don't make the same mistake we did! My 6-year-old son decided to spend his birthday money on this Pokemon toy. Despite our unsuccessful efforts to talk him out of it, he insisted this was what he wanted and it came home with us. Oh brother, what a piece of junk. Very flimsy plastic pieces that don't securely fasten together, poor instructions and one Pokemon rubber toy is what you get. Of course, it looks impressive on the box, but once it's together (loosely-fitted together, that is), you have a poorly designed, poorly made toy. You also get a cardboard cutout of a Pokemon hospital that you fold together (woo hoo) and some cardboard backing that requires using your own tape to secure to the back of the toy. Only one thing was no surprise in this surprisingly bad toy: our 6-year-old becoming bored with it in a couple days."
1,Utter Piece of Garbage,I purchased one month ago from Toy's R US. My son was so excited he couldn't wait until we got home to open it. I spent 50$ on this and it is literally the worst toy I have ever purchased. Poor quality isn't the word. I can't even believe they are allowed to sell this for more than $10.00 Please don't waste your money!!!!!
1,"Terrible, Terrible, Terrible","I wish I had read the reviews prior to purchasing this toy for a Christmas gift. My daughter loves Pokemon and we got her this for Christmas. It never assembled well, it kept falling over and breaking. She played with it for all of 10 minutes before it was unenjoyable. It is junk and after 6 months has ended up in the garbage because the parts would not stay together."
1,Total junk,Bought this toy for my son - it fell apart almost immediately... HORRIFIC - We paid $35 for it and returned it. Not worth $1.
2,Glad I didn't pay more than $12 !!!,"So my 6 year old LOVES Pokemon. He wanted this toy so badly from Santa. After reading the bad reviews on here there was NO way I was paying the $$$ they were sking for it. Then the week before Christmas Amazon dropped it to $10.99 with FS. So I bit and bought it. He wa sthrilled to see it ynder the tree. It was hard to assemble and has been falling apart since. However I don't feel bad cause it was only $10, so if it makes him happy whatever...I would have been weeping if I had paid anymore than what I did...lol."
3,I'd have to say it's so-so,"Pokemon are very popular. Kids are happy to get anything pokemon. However, once they get to actually playing with it... it's fun but not too sturdy. It doesn't stay together well and is found in pieces all throughout my home. Would be fine for a careful kid but if you have one that's rough on toys I would look for something else. I do appreciate that it's something that encourages imaginative and social playing but it should either be made better or charged less for it."
1,BIG piece of shiitake !,"Everyone else pretty much summed up what we think of this garbage. Fits together poorly. Ridiculous cardboard folding building, like something from the 60's technology. Only one character. And how the hell do you play it. It has no instructions except how to build it. Use your imagination I guess. Avoid at all costs...my son couldn't have been more disappointed !"
4,Much better than expected!,"Santa brought this toy to my 6-year-old son. He had nearly begged for it since seeing it in person, but I read the almost all NEGATIVE reviews and told him that we would NOT be adding this to the Christmas list. And then Amazon ran an amazing sale...ha ha! The look on my son's face on Christmas morning was priceless. He was amazed that Santa had over-ruled Mom and Dad and brought the toy anyway. The toy has held up much better than anticipated after reading the reviews. We did have part of the dome pop off when the dog had an unsuccessful attempt at hopping over the toy in order to get away from the Pokemon attack! But that's the only time we've had trouble with pieces falling off during play. We have certainly enjoyed Santa's surprise!"
5,War Is Hell!,"I've read all of Evelyn Kennedy's books and found this to be every bit as entertaining as her others. Set in war torn Europe during WWII, the warmth and understanding of the characters made it endearing to me. I eagerly await Kennedy's next work."
4,Very helpful little book,"It is a small little book but a wealth of different words, sayings and phrases that are easy to find quickly. It even has pronunciation keys that make a huge difference in what is communicated."
3,"Good, but limited","I purchased this dictionary two years ago and didn't end up using it that much. It's a fine little dictionary, but there are very few entries -- too few to be really useful if you're a serious student. After about a year, I purchased the Tuttle Compact Vietnamese-English dictionary, which is much more extensive and has actual usage examples. And frankly, it wasn't very expensive.Anyway, this pocket dictionary might be nice to take along on a quick trip to Vietnam, as it's very slim, but otherwise I'd go with the Tuttle."
3,Ok...,"I did pickup some useful words from this book, but not a valuable as some of the more extensive dictionaries out there. The format was basic, not out of the ordinary."
3,VN translations Difficult,"A difficult translation from VN to English was observed by this reader. The dictionary doesn't seem to always match the written word as put forward by the interest group that I work with. Often the spelling doesn't appear in the dictionary for VN to English or the regional dialect of my group is different from the writers' focus. I can't complain too much because the on-line translation from google also doesn't make sense a lot of times also. Anyway, the Periplus pocket dictionary may work much better if going from English to VN. That I can only guess. Thanks for the opportunity to make the review."
1,atrocious transfer,"Whenever one purchases a video the quality of the transfer is of utmost importance. What good is purchasing a vhs tape or a dvd if watching it becomes an exercise in perseverence? The transfer for this vhs was unbearable. I owned it already, but my tape was twenty years old and had decayed measureably including noticeable flaking.Nevertheless, it played better than my recent purchase!"
2,awseome!!,"Cathrine is a wonderful young lady who wants to find her brother. While her uncle does nothing about the ransom they got ,because it might be a fake, Cathrine thinks they should rescue him . He is all she has since her parents died.She remembers one of her brothers friends , named Derrick St.John , and decides to seek his help in rescuing her brother in Savanna. He takes her and they fall in love . She wonders if she could ever mean anything to him but his friends little sister . He loves her also but he can't because of his past .

They kiss, or almost kiss, a lot of times in this story, but not really a real kiiss untill the end of the story . i will not tell anymore. this is a VERY good book and I would highly recomend you read it ."
5,a great read!,"i really enjoyed this book. it all started when Catherine Markham's brother Royce had been captured by the British. She knows no one who can help her except Captain Derrick St. John, captain of one her family's shipping business roads. So she goes to see him dressed as a boy. He soon realizes its her and he agrees to help her. On the voyage, they start to realize they care about each other when Derrick unexpectedly kisses her when the pirates attack! Soon after, they get to Savannah and Derrick has to clear his father's name from becoming a traitor to the America's. To find out if Catherine gets her brother back or if Derrick and Catherine fall in love, read the book."
5,Interesting,"this book is very good, unlike the other Avon True Romances i have read, Karen Hawkins portrays an avid sense of humor, it had me and my sister in stitches. I'd say it is the best of the series....so far"
5,"A ""must"" for all R&B fans!","In A Touch Of Classic Soul 2: The Late 1970s, Marc Taylor draws upon the extensive interviews he conducted with most of the prominent R&B recording artists of that decade and shares with the readers how these men and women describe the beginning of their singing careers, how they got their first professional break, how some of their biggest hits were created, what their experiences were like upon reaching the height of their success, how they fared during the rise of disco in the mid-1970s, and what their level of involvement in the music industry is today. Many of the principal players in the popular music scene are presented including Earth, Wind and Fire; the Commodores, chic; Chaka Khan; Brass Construction, Heatwave; Rose Royce, L.T.D; Con Funk Shun; and thirty-one of the top soul music artists of the era. A Touch Of Classic Soul 2 is definitive, informative, and a ""must"" for all R&B fans!"
4,Panasonic Sport Headphones,These are great if you need something for workingout & don't need the best sound quality in the world. Sound quality is good & you can still hear outside noises which is good for those of us that live in cities where drivers don't care if they hit you & rapists/killers never sleep. The headphones have survived my workout bag so far & they have survived my crazy amounts of sweating without getting stinky. My one dislike is that they don't get any tighter on your ears. They haven't fallen off yet but they don't feel secure either.
2,Great fit bad sound,I previously had the koss but changed since they keep falling out. I have tried this for about 3 weeks @ 3x a day. The fit is the best and I never have to touch them again. The biggest problem is the sound. I don't constantly have to fiddle with the earphones however I do have to change the volume constantly. For some reason the highs are extremely tinny/loud and when playing certain music it hurts my ears. The bass is obviously lacking. I'm no audiophile but when playing music that used to sound good on regular headphones now hurts the ears is really bad. I think I had to crank the volume so high to hear the mids and lows that when the highs come in they hurt.Overall:Fit: 5 starsSound: 1 star
4,Great Item,"They are very confortable to run and the sound quality is acceptable, you still hear the outside and enjoy the music. I would have given the 5 stars with more sound clarity."
1,wrong ones,"ordered 2 sets each are different vehicles, got one that worked fine the other was for my wifes 06 chevy cobalt ""SEDAN"" they sent one for a coup 2dr, wrote them got nothing back owe well...."
3,2009 Chevy Cobalt 92322 2-Piece Smoke Ventvisor,"Ventvisors are exactly as ordered, but original packaging from Manufacturer could be a little stronger and a label stating to ""Do not bend"" or ""Fragile"" could be applied to box, before shipping. Original Box arrived bent, causing a white line in Driver's Side Shade. Did notice the box damage and looked for damage to ventvisor, but did not see the white mark in the Vent Shade, until the visor was already put on. Does not affect the performance of the Ventvisor, just a visible white line, as when most plastics get bent."
4,Great Voice,"Matt Zarley has a great voice and it's worth buying the CD for that. Some of the music has that ""Star Search"" quality, but the CD is worth the price just for Matt. Looking forward to the next CD."
2,Not what I expected,Zarley might be okay if you go in for the boy band sound. He came recommended with some great singers doing old standards and swing. That is not what this guy is about. A CD of needy love songs in a very contemporary format. His voice is nothing special and his style far from unique.
1,"Bootleg, Phoney CD",This CD is a fake. It's a bootleg and has nothing to do with the Doobie Brothers music. They stole an image of the Doobies to sell the CD. Don't buy it!
5,Jwin 10 cd changer audio system,"This is a terrific item, excellent sound with easy to use concept.at this price everyone can have a great sound system in their homes."
3,"Tastes like molassisy honey. Good, but cost is prohibitive.","If it were much cheaper, I could see buying this regularly. I guess I just got it to try it out? I need to stop wasting money on impulse buys."
1,Reading this book may cause acne...,"This book is long on saccharine and short on tutorial reference. I was hoping that this book would be a definitive reference text on how to use PhotoSuite 4, but I found that the majority of the text is devoted to pap that I'm not interested in (e.g., entire chapters on, believe it or not, ""Cheap gifts and chic digital accessories"" or ""PhotoSuite 4 for fun and profit""). The few chapters that actually deal with using the product itself are too lightweight to be much assistance. In all fairness, this book would be good for young people under age 12, ultimate computer-phobes... If you're looking for a serious product reference, skip this text."
2,PhotoSuite 4 for Dummies,Inasmuch as this complete program as changed as PhotoSuite upgraded (?) their program to 8.0. Therefore this book is different than the look in new program. The complete process has changed making this book a poor guide and help!!!!!!!!!!
1,Cast Iron Anvil Shaped Object,"I am not picking on Grizzly tools in particular as there are other tool merchants that count on customer inexperience to sell low quality merchandise. This anvil, probably made in China, is CAST IRON. It is soft and will mark and dent easily if you actually hit it with anything. A good anvil is made from CAST OR FORGED STEEL and has been hardened to resist marking. If you just want a big heavy iron thing in your shop to give it some panache, this might be perfect for you. If you actually plan to do amature blacksmithing, this is NOT the tool for you."
4,Reissued again...,"This CD is yet another reissue of ""Tangled Up In Blues,"" the Bob Dylan tribute in the now defunct House Of Blues' This Ain't No Tribute series. The artwork is exclusive to this Dutch release, but the tracks are the same. That said, it's well worth having if you don't have any of the earlier versions. A host of blues and blues-rock artists cover Dylan, with mixed but generally favorable results. Included are ""One Too Many Mornings"" by The Band and Leon Russell's ""Watching The River Flow,"" two artists with 30+ year Dylan connections. It's also good to hear some of Bob's later songs being performed, such as ""Everything Is Broken"" by R.L. Burnside, and the Time Out Of Mind song ""Million Miles"" by Alvin Youngblood Hart."
2,Incorrect Information for Williams College,"I'm a student at Williams College and I previewed what the book said about my school, through the ""Look inside the book feature."" This book says Williams has 1,200 undergrads which is completely wrong. We have about 2,100 undergrads. Being 75% off about a school's size is not good. I dont know if there are other factual errors but based on the Williams entry, I would assume so."
2,I would have to agree with the not-too-stellar review below......,"...there is no denying there are errors in this book. My friend's daughter is searching for a college, and after reading my alma mater's entry - I told her to look elsewhere for her information. Signed - a ""Mawrtyr"" - class of '90."
1,Money down the drain...,"I found this book extremely hard to understand the author has rushed through everything. Does not explain the code, it's just been printed on the page for you to look at which is just ridiculous. I feel I didn't learn much from the book and had to keep referring to other text books and the internet. Don't recommend it at all.I'd also like to add, I wish I had listened to the above reviewer. I thought I'd still give it a try. I regret this."
2,I SEARCHING CD'S FROM ANDRE GAGNON,"I WANTED ALL VOLUMES OF CD'S FROM ANDRE GAGNON, HERE IN COLOMBIA IDON'T GET THIS CD'S"
2,Don't believe it's for beards and mustaches,"Ordered this to use on my beard and mustache as I had trouble finding the Grecian formula in stores, and the website description specifically says ""Comes with mixing tray and brush so it can be used both on the head and facial hair"". This was not true, the boxes had nothing on them about being used on facial hair, there was no mixing tray, no brush, and no instructions for using less than the whole bottle/tube combination at once, or on facial hair."
5,fantastic,I have used other brands but this is my personal favorite. The product lasts me for weeks and leaves my hair the same as it was before using it.. It does not look artificial and even my barber told me it's impossible for him to tell if someone used the product.
5,Surprisingly good!,"I have to admit that I was embarrassed at first to be reading this book. I like Katie, she's tough, she's fully capable of handling things on her own and taking care of herself, but really ... falling in love with a statue?? AND, his name is Jorlan! Ugh, I mean, c'mon!!That said, the book was far more humorous than I originally thought it would be. I found myself laughing out loud during several parts of it (Jorlan's ""weapons"" spring to mind). It was very romantic and very sweet. I liked that it was completely different, that was very cool. Not just another same ole, same ole kinda story.Definitely give this book a read, it is a good one."
2,Making Out With A Statue Is An Odd Opening to a Book,"Ths book started out with the heroine up on the pedestal of a statue, feeling him up and trying to overcome her attraction to him. Oh, good lord, why did I continue reading this book? When she finally decides to kiss him, he becomes a live man and the rest of the book is made up of her pretending to be sassy and independent, but then caving in to his demands the minute he gets forceful. The storyline is very predictable, with her brothers getting all stupid and protective over her even though she's supposedly A Woman of Independent Mind. Ugh. I guess I should have listened to my spidey sense when it started tingling & taken this book back to the library."
5,Buy This Book!,"Oh my gosh, this was good.It was so hot and so funny I can't wait for her next book to come out."
4,ADORABLE!,"Okay, the premise for this is kind of out there, a woman who had had bad luck with men gets a house that she intends to renovate and, lo and behold, there is a statue in the yard that's she attracted to. Turns out, the statue is really a man from another universe who has been sent here as punishment. And he has enemies looking for him. But as quirky as this book sounds -- I crinkled my nose when I read the blurb -- it actually surprised me. It is witty, fun and there were lots of ""awwwww"" moments. The characters are so adorable and soon you lose yourself in the interaction between the main characters. It's a fast read, but it is also endearing. I put this on my shelf for another read, which may be soon."
4,Liked it....,"I liked this book, just didn't love it. Part of the problem for me was that I just finished reading ""A hunger like no other"", so to me this was not as exciting, or steamy in comparison. The ending was a little disappointing to me also. It wasn't a bad book, just a little flat."
2,Quite annoying and infuriating.,"When I first picked up this book, I was a bit wary. There were numerous positive reviews, yes,but the negative reviews pinpointed exactly what I hate in a book. I should have gone with my instincts because I could not finish this book, or even get remotely into it, because both lead characters pissed me off so much. You have the male lead who's basically ""I male. You female. Have sex"" and the lead female who tries to convince everyone she's strong and independent but succumbs to his every whim. One reveiwer wrote that she's ""tough as nails"" I believe, but I just couldn't see it! All I saw was a weak whiny heroine and a dominant annoying hero who made me want to punch his perfect face for treating the heroine like dirt."
5,Love that man with a spatula!,"I can't believe the reviews that say this is like J. Lindsey's Warrior's Woman. Showalter writes a book that gives the heroine much more power than Lindsey's book. Jorlan is charmingly out of place, and so ends up losing a bit of that Warrior edge. And Katie does get the upper hand with him at times, unlike Lindsey's heroine. This is what makes Showalter's book work for me. It's much more about two people struggling to find an equal footing with each other. That plus sexy romance and a great villain. The addition of Percen to this book as a villain who ends up being sympathetic and changed also adds a depth that is missing from Warrior's Woman, which I enjoyed.Many books are similar in this genre because we readers like certain elements. It's what an author does with those elements that sets her apart. And Gena Showalter is carving out a niche all her own. I can't wait to read Awaken Me Darkly."
2,Could have been better...a LOT better.,"Mildly entertaining, but I ended up skipping over several parts and forced myself to finish it. I grew annoyed with the constant arrogance of the male lead character, and the female lead character basically giving in because ""oh, my god, he's SO HOT!"" No matter how attractive I find a guy, no way would I let one treat me like he did just because he's ""hot""; in fact, his character traits (arrogance, sexual intimidation, sexual coercion, to name a few) would make him pretty ugly in my eyes. The few positive things he did failed to redeem his character in my opinion. So much for a supposed independent lead female character. The male lead basically marrying her without her knowledge (tricking her)...and her inane response? That was the clincher. Glad I borrowed from the library and didn't actually pay for this."
4,Beautiful movie,"This is a good movie. Ann Blyth is in love With Stewart Granger but he takes off so she marries his brother who owns a whaling schooner. But then Granger comes back. And he wants her back but her husband, Robert Taylor, loves her & he's not going to give her up. It becomes a fight of who's the strongest & the best."
3,Atom,"Isaax Asimov is a science fiction writer, but he also writes non fiction, science books. He writes in a way that makes the average person understand what he is explaining. None the less, I found this book way over my head. I think I need something a little less complex. The subject I know is complex, but I could have used an easier explanation. I was a little disappointed with it."
5,a brilliant explaination of the facts,"i enjoyed the book. it is easy to read except for the chapter on quarks, which is difficult to comprehend. i will recommend this book to every one who wishes to learn about the subatomic world. there is only one drawback for this book. it was published in 1991 and there have been more additions to the subatomic world since then. the history of the search for atom and its constituents is splendid. I love mathematics but i am too lazy to do it. so for folks who don't like to dwell in mathematics to understand particle physics, this is the right book for you"
3,"Very basic, not a lot of info","This is an okay over view, but doesn't have a lot of details and is also at least 20 years old. Some advances have been made and the new info might be very helpful in plannning a project."
5,The reader feels personally involved in this novel.,Ms. Thomas has an exceptional writing style. The reader feels as though they are a part of the character's lives. Nelson and Shelby come to life in the descriptive wording and believable story line. This is an excellent romance novel. I would recommend this book to all romance novel lovers as well as those that have shared tradgedy as a couple and want to gain an insight into strenghening instead of corruption of their relationship as a result.
4,Sk8ter's Mom,"(...) I bought this book for my son who likes extreme sports and doesn't like to read. He did read this one and LOVED it. It has been my impression that the people who love this area of sports are free spirited and non judgemental.(...) The book was well written, I would recommend it."
1,Not good,"To keep it short, this book is the worst book i ever read on extreme sports.If you`re interested in extreme sports, get the tony hawk autobiography, but better keep your hands off this one."
2,Alright,"This book wasnt all I thought it was cracked up to be, it was actually very dull sometimes. He doesnt seem to know what he is talking about to much and talks in very stereotypical terms sometimes. I wouldnt suggest this book."
5,Awesome Book,Amped was an awesome book that really looked at the extreme sport industry. I loved it!
1,this book was interesting,I picked this book up for a quick read because ive been a participant in skateboarding and rollerblading since i was 12. I was surprised about his objective views on the topic but i gave it a chance. Some of the facts were flat out wrong and i think he may need to go back and check some of his sources. I dont believe he is the best person to write a book like this and i think he is just trying to ride the wave of skateboarding's popularity. I'd recommend skipping over this book.
1,not worth buying...,"I have been skateboarding for several years now and can honestly say that ""amped"" gives a faulse impression not only of my sport but of extreme sports in general.There are many books out there of a simular nature to ""amped"" writen by people who know what they are talking about, i suggest you buy one of those instead."
1,This book should have been written by a professional,"Im not a skater, bmxer, or rollerblader. I am a critic and was told to review this book honestly. Honestly it is very bland. It leaves you hoping the next chapter is the final chapter. I dis-like publications that leave me bored throughout each sentence. I would only compare this to my 5th grade social studies bible I so desprately wanted to burn in my fireplace.. Give it a chance and know that you will probably feel the same way.."
1,Oh no.,"This book is a badly written (very melodramatic, lots of inexplicable switches to the past tense, and choices in diction based apparently on using as many syllables as possible on every topic ... reads like an AP English essay) explanation by an outsider to outsiders of something that's essentially an insider phenomenon. Imagine a 300 page book by Bob Costas on punk rock. Humorous at first, then grating, and ultimately not useful for understanding what's actually going on."
4,Mismarketed?,"This is a lovely book, but it's a children's book: I bet the publishers simply wanted to widen the possible market by playing down that aspect. I understand that Louis de Bernieres is more than halfway through his next ""grown-up"" novel and has just been having some interim fun with Red Dog. Why not? I certainly enjoyed reading it and appreciated the stylish drawings. It's an elegant package."
2,kids,"i disagree and think this is ldb's attempt at a kids or juniors book, i can see it being taught in australian classrooms"
5,Red Dog,I found the book to be very good and hard to put down. The short stories were funny with the exception of the last one.
4,Red Dog Review,Red dog was an enjoyable read - I saw the movie first which obviously enlarged on the real story somewhat - it was worth reading though
5,A great story,Every aussie should read this. Way better than the movie. Written with feeling and emotion which grips the reader firmly in it's grasp.
5,The best of what the Therapy Sisters offer is here.,"The Early Years is a good overview of the Therapy Sisters' work for those who are new to the group. Longtime fans will enjoy reminiscing. The music and harmonies are complex enough to be interesting but not distracting from the real strength of this band, the lyrics. These women have a real gift for capturing the human experience from the whimsical to the deep angst and joy of life."
4,great on-site radio,"i agree with most of the reviews here. the charm of this beauty is that if you have other makita tools with batteries then they will fit this radio. it doesn't charge batteries but why should it? it would be a much bigger unit. by the by - it DOES have an AUX jack (contrary to what other reviewers have said). it is located in the rear compartment where the battery is inserted and is at the top of the compartment. and with the space that that compartment has you could have an MP3 player in there, protected from dust, water etc..."
3,No charging,Other brands of jobsite radios charge batteries if the unit is plugged into AC. This one doesn't. Factor in the cost of an extra battery if you need all you've got and want to run this radio. An aux-in port would be nice. Sound is pretty good for the size of the radio and considering the side-facing speakers. FM reception is good.
4,Great Radio...still could've been better.,"I picked up this radio because of its ""Cool Looks', and it matches my makita tools. I like the compact size, stereo sounds are strong, and nice lighted screen, and the alarm options and dual battery type is a big plus.However, too bad its not a charger! I also notice a little extra space in the main battery compartment, has anyone tried to use that space as an extra battery holder? (I managed to tightly squeeze a second battery in there... hmmm)."
4,AC adapter easily damaged,This is a great radio that's also durable. The case feels solid and possibly indestructible. The AC adapter is the only issue with a radio that should be durable as it broke in 6 months. Now moving the cord the radio turns on and off. Replacement cord was $27 from Makita and was not the end of the world just thought it should be more durable or even have no AC adapter in a radio at this price. The sound quality is great. The controls have a nice feel. Overall I'm satisfied with it everyday I can use it on the job site just upset when it's dumb AC adapter/ cord was and I missed a few days.
2,No Ipod input!!????,Why would they make this without a ipod input?! How do I use it then with my ipod or satellite radio? Just about no one onsite anymore is listening to regular radio and the Howard fans all have a sirius setup.
1,poor advertising,"The item you advertised, was not exactly as described. It would have been nice to know in the description that it did not have a charger section for the batteries of other matching tools.. Most all other manufacturers, have charges with radio."
4,"Good Sound, Very Rugged, NO AUXILLARY INPUT FOR IPOD OR PORTABLE MUSIC PLAYER","Lasts pretty long on the lithium ion battery. If you want to connect your IPOD,mp3 or cd player get the white model. If you're only looking to use the radio it gets good reception and sounds clear."
5,Wicked good radio !!!,I am completely satisfied with this product...It was a great price and the shipping was fast and free. Would highly recommend purchasing this radio or other items from Amazon ! Thanks so much.Michael at Further North Farm.
3,"Makita Quality, Minus Needed Features","I bought the radio with The LXT 400 kit. My supplier threw it in, yeah right. Anyway, the radio has very good sound and reception. However, it would make much more sense if it doubled as a charger. I think an input would be nice too."
1,Horrible Reception I Hate This Radio,"I bought the whole shibang cause i wanted a small radio to have at work that sounds good. Radio sounds good, but it wont get reception for anything. I strongly advise trying one out in your work areas first. I am am going to go buy a Dewalt radio and battery and give this away if anyone will take it cause its garbage. Oh I live and work in Portland Oregon so its not like i am far from a radio tower. Battery lasts 2 8 hr shifts, but just cant hear the radio stations over the static even on a fresh charge."
2,Whimpy,I have to say this product is not made very sturdy. If my 20 month old threw the ball from the side of the pool we were ok but if anyone actually tried to dunk the ball in the pool we had trouble and had to reconstruct. I'd spend a little more money next time and get a better product.
3,floating basket ball,The item would have been great if it had come as a whole. the ball and the net didnt arrive with the set and the connections are not tight so I have had to tape them to make them secure. If the set had come whole it would have been great.
3,Faded,"Looked great to start, floats great... however over the past 2 months colors have faded tremendously. Disappointing..."
2,Pool basketball set,Bought this toy to use in the hotel pool while on a visit with my grandsons. They used it for about 10 minutes and then decided it was more fun to pull the balls off the frame and throw them around. Their dog got the beach ball and bit it so that put an end to it.
3,Don't waste your money,The ball can barely fit through the ring making it tvery frustrating for my 12 year old son. He has had other basketball games for the pool that worked well but this is not one of them - we ended up getting another brand and threw this one out.
4,Chess,Warning first: This program was designed for Windows95. As far as I can tell it does NOT work with Windows2000!An excellent game with a very good reproduction of tournament mechanics and conditions.Note: this game was produced about 1996 so be aware that it is becoming dated compared to state of the art (though that doesn't change that much since chess has been around for centuries).
3,Typical Leslie,"I love Leslie Sansone. This was for me, like all the other videos. I needed a little more fast paced. I enjoyed 4 fast miles better, but I like that this had 1 mile at a time. I would like a option of combining the miles, without the cool down and warm up at the end of each. Would be great for beginners."
5,Starting out,I love this DVD. I just thinks it's for people who is just starting to workout with walking DVD's or for people who wants to do a mile or two at a slower pace. This DVD is good for concentrating on each body part per workout. A added bonus is she gives you and show you how to cook a breaksfast menu for the week. This is very helpful.
3,Disappointing,"I own 5 or 6 of Leslie's DVDs and they are very helpful burning calories without creating injuries. However, I was somewhat disappointed with this collection, mainly for small reasons. The workouts presented seem less organized. There is very little prep or lead-in for move changes, which is annoying. The whole first mile didn't have any knee lifts, a staple of aerobic calorie burn. The workouts are improved by carrying hand-weights (though it's not mentioned or suggested).Good to turn to for a change of pace if you're getting bored with other DVD collections but overall disappointing."
4,good start,"After four years of no exercise I am getting back to it to shape up following abdominal surgery. This DVD is great for low impact aerobics for the non-athletic, uncoordinated, middle-aged woman like me."
5,A great addition to the Leslie collection,"I recently rented this from Netflix to see if I'd like it. I do. It's great to be able to do any one of the five separate miles or combine two or more of them. Plus it has a separate warm up and cool down in the menu, so you can easily select what you want for the workout. I kind of miss the collection of ""walkers"" she has in the Walk Away the Pounds collection -- it's fun to watch the exercisers - helps to pass the time. But, as others have said, some of the quips and comments become a bit tedious after hearing them so many times. After reviewing this DVD and doing a couple of the workouts, I decided to buy it. It will be my 4th Leslie DVD (plus her yoga DVD), but that's o.k. It's good to vary them to keep motivated!"
3,"""Where have all the people gone""","I purchased this DVD as I somehow misplaced my Leslie Sansone DVD during some home construction. My original Leslie Sansone workout was on VHS and I had replaced that with a DVD - bringing me into the twenty-first century. One of my favorite parts of the Leslie Sansone workouts has been seeing others in a range of condition. It made me feel like I could do it too. I actually felt like we were a team working together to improve our fitness. In this video I find the pictures of such perfect people on the wall annoying - really makes me feel bad about the shape I have allowed myself to get into - the team effort is missing. I like the different mile workouts - I miss the use of weights (which I really felt helped) - I find the cool down goes on forever and start skipping ahead to get to the stretching. I will search for that missing DVD so I can get back to working out with other ""not always perfect"" people."
3,Walking at home,"I like it -- when I remember I have it. I prefer walking outside, where I don't watch the clock tick down. However, for those times I want to walk and cannot due to weather.... it is perfect!"
5,"Great DVD, wonderful exercise!","I have several walking dvds by Leslie Sansone and this one is excellent. Service very good, condition excellent. No complaints."
4,Great!!,This is the first exercise DVD I have purchased that I can say has kept motivated and has shown results.
1,would not buy again,would not buy again. not satisfied with product in any way shape or form. as i said would not do again
5,Works every muscle,"I've lost 36 pounds with Leslie's dvds and jump at the chance to try anything new that she does. I did all 5 miles of this workout and was very impressed! When done all together, it's her most challenging and versatile workout yet. The first mile is a classic walk; the second focuses on arms; the third, legs, with squats and lunges along with the walking; the fourth, abs, with lots of standing ab work; and the last, a speed walking mile. There is a warm up and a cool down with a nice amount of stretching at the end. There are some new variations to the basic walking steps in this dvd that keep it fresh and fun, and the music is also updated. It's a great dvd for beginners who can do a mile at a time, or for Leslie veterans who can do the entire dvd for a challenge."
5,Mom,"I have several of Leslie's workout DVD's. By far this DVD is one of her best. You really get a great workout when you complete the 5 miles together. I do like Leslie by herself as well as with other walkers. Being a mom and trying to find time during the day to workout and have the weather cooperate can be challenging. That's why I like Leslie's DVD's, they are so convenient no matter how much time you have or what the weather outside is like."
3,Better off with individual dvds,"I have the 1, 2 and 3 mile Leslie Sansone dvds. I do like the mile a day one except she says to do one thing and then does something different. It's a good cardio workout that is low impact. I have doubled up and do 2 miles each day from the dvd so that maybe the weight will start to drop like the inches have. It is a good dvd if you want a quick workout and you don't have a lot of time. However, the first mile did nothing for me...very boring and slow!"
5,Awesome and effective,"Leslie does a great job of delivering a great walk at home fitness dvd. She really focuses on giving you a good workout without all the excessive chatter and giggles. It's great for days where you need to fit something quick into the day, for bad weather days, or if you want to do a longer walk at home. Great job and I look forward to using more of her videos. The five walks give a lot of variety on one dvd. I highly recommend, especially for busy working moms."
4,Leslie Sansone: 5 Day Slim Down,This is a good DVD that gets you motivated to workout. You have different options and they are quick to do (15 minutes). You can feel the difference after doing them.
5,Great Workout,I have to say I am one of the those people with a library of workout videos and I have to say this one is the best. I like the variety of each day workout. I have her 3 mile and I have to say that can get a little repetitive but not this one. I also enjoy that she is workingout by herself which takes the focus off of the other people and the music is nice and updated.
4,Great Exercise for Home,"Before I got this dvd, I borrowed it from the library for a year. I finally bought it because it's worth it! It's a great way to get your heart pumping for even as short as 15 minutes and yet still see results after a few weeks."
5,5 day slim down,"A friend suggested I check out the DVDs by Leslie Sansone so I came on amazon to look for them. The first one I chose was the 5 Day Slim Down- A Mile Each Morning DVD. First of all the DVD arrived very promptly and it was in great condition. I put the DVD in my player just to get a glimpse of what I was in store for. I went through the different sections and am so very satisfied! I can surely do 15 minutes a day and each day takes you to the next stage of exercise walking and you are definitely building up a sweat, stamina, and strength. There is also a section on the DVD where Leslie Sansone gives you nutritious meal tips which is definitely a plus! I am totally satisfied and have been referring her products to my friends and family!"
4,Exactly as it's described,I like this DVD. It's got enough variety so I'm not bored and I can fit each mile along with warm up and cool down in about a 20-30 minute timeslot and feel like I get a light workout.
5,The Two Of Us..,"Having recently added this one to my collection and being in my 60's, I must say that I just love it because it works all the parts of my body and I can choose which ones I want to do each day. OK most of Leslie's other workouts have this but my main pleasure is that It's only Leslie doing this one without all the usual chatter amongst the others, as someone mentioned previously the constant chatting and jokes become quite boring once you have done a workout several times.I'm also happy to do the warm up and the cool down stretching which is not available in many previous workouts.I do wish there was more of the Yoga related cool down stretching. I shall live in anticipation......"
4,GREAT ADDITION TO YOUR WALK AT HOME LIBRARY,"I am a devoted customer of Leslie Sansone. I have practically all of her videos and this one is good to have in your video library. Overall, the music is great it is modern and helps you keep up the pace. I am an advanced walker and needed a challenge in my workouts, THIS IS IT. I love how she had developed each mile to work specific parts or your body. If you are an advanced walker, this video will add variety to your collection."
3,Good workout!,"This is a good workout, I like that you can do them all together or split it over 5 days."
3,5 day slim down,I've used a friend's copy of another of Leslie's DVDs and wanted one for myself. I like the variation in each of the 5 miles. There is some production issues - music does not flow well in spots for a professional production - but it can be ignored.
4,Fun!,"This is a fun workout with lot's of variation. I didn't give it 5 stars cause the background was distracting...the traffic can be seen out the window and occassionlly the scene outside the window changes from bushes and a street to a brick building??? Also there's a film on the windows that is lose and flaps and creates a glare from time to time. Other than that, it is a typical Leslie workout. The moves are simple yet effective. Every mile has a little something different. She talks a lot, but it's not annoying."
4,Good low-impact workout for middle-aged ladies,"I like this workout because I have bad knees, and it's difficult finding a cardio routine that spares my knees. I can do any of the miles, or all of them."
5,Anyone Can Do This,"Anyone can walk and this DVD 5 different 1 mile routines. She suggests doing this workout in the morning but I've been doing it a few times a day, getting in a few miles a day. You can pick the pace that is best for you and she adds in things like arm curls, lunges, bum kicks. There's also a suggested meal plan. Overall a nice program to start or get back into exercise."
5,Still the best book for people implementing a strongly-typed functional language,"After all these years, this book remains the best source for anyone implementing a strongly-typed functional language. Providing an excellent introduction to all of the basic transformations (CPS), optimizations (contraction, CSE, call site optimization, etc.), and basic compilation techniques (closure conversion, etc.), this book holds everything you need to go from an initial AST to generating x86 code.Naturally, it would be nice to have an update that touches on control-flow analysis-based optimizations or provides more detailed backend examples using MLRISC or LLVM. But for the time it was written, this book has stood up remarkably well."
5,A Hawk for the Bush by J. Mavrogordato,"""A Hawk for the bush"" is a timeless classic on the training and keeping of the short-winged Hawks known as Accipiters. A must read for any falconer interested in trying his/her hand at these delicate and temperamental raptors. Jack Mavrogordato was truly a pioneer at managing and breeding, at a time when captive breeding of raptors was in it's infancy.I highly recommend this book to the apprentice falconer considering flying a Accipiter upon turning General class. And to the Master falconer wanting to explore and glean knowledge from a man who truly had a passion for Accipiters.As a bonus, there is a wonderful series of templates for hood making at the end of the book. Having made some of them myself, I can vouch for the great fit, and accuracy of these patterns. I keep returning to them year after year, when I want to make a good fitting Indian hood. That in itself is worth the price of the book!Connie S.Idaho"
3,violence,"In 1923, Kim Shun-Pei moves from South Korea to Osaka (Japan). The movie shows him becoming a greedy, violent man over the years. One day he decides to build a factory of processed seafood and there, exploits his employees. Kim also abuses his wife and his entire family. After making a small fortune with his seafood factory, he closes the business and becomes a loan shark.This certainly was well done, the actors were good, Takeshi Kitano as Kim is truly exceptional. The photography is decent and the direction is excellent.I'm quite sure there are some passages that aren't well translated if at all - some parts of the scripts were not well explained or didn't make sense with the rest of the story.Also, it is much too long. After more than 2 hours, the violence depicted gets to you, and you want the movie to be over really soon.Still worth watching once."
3,A good movie but unpleasant,"It is a well-made movie, portraying the bleak lives of early 20th-century Korean immigrants to Japan and the hardships they faced. However, the main character is a man who is so brutal and violent that he corrupts or destroys pretty much everything he touches, especially his family. No one seems to possess any redeeming qualities. It is a glimpse into the harsh reality these people must have faced but leaves an unpleasant aftertaste."
2,Poor Construction,The headphone jack is soldered directly to the circuit board. This causes any force applied to the head phone jack to break off the joints causing the head phones to die one side at a time. A good concept but poor execution. Don't put it in your pocket. Also the front screw has been glued in place to make repair very difficult.
5,Many Useful and Quality Tools,"Pros: The compass and other components are of great quality. I bought this set for an engineering course, and I have used almost all of the pieces in this kit multiple times to produce very neat drawings. The mechanical pencil is especially nice.Cons: The bag it comes with is pretty unattractive and the three sided scale has a couple small chips in its edge. I think these were from my use, but they are fairly minor."
2,Not worth it,Bought this product for ME drafting classTriangles are nice not very useful. Doesn't have any markersRuler doesn't have 1/16 in scale so not useful outside of engineeringNice items but I would buy something else
5,Gift,This will be a gift for my husband who has recently returned to finish his Electrical engineering degree. This will be helpful in completing his technical drawing requirements in class.
1,it really sux........,i picked up this book at the library as i am interested in this subject and wants to know some stuffs about it but really..some of the arguments/discussions about some stuffs like god/reincarnation are really stupid.. i gave up reading the book halfway... mainly the book is about what some particular philosoper says and why everything is sort of like a introduction to the topic but the introduction doesnt really interest the reader to find out more...instead it bore the readers with stupid whys to the question.....i thought a beginner guide should interest and give good information....
1,What!! This does not work right,"I have many different flash/usb drives that I use for music, etc.This chunk of junk only supports the Lexar flashdrives. Forget it.I got mine from Fry's for $40 and back it goes tomorrow."
3,Meh...,These pads didn't seem to stop the squealing. I ended up selling the entire brake setup. I did all the toeing crap with no avail. Salmon pads helped me on my other setup.
5,Nice stopping power!,"I installed these on my commuter bike this spring, and they are good stuff. One of the first things I did after I installed these pads was nearly launch myself over the handlebars. That was my own stupid fault for waiting too long to replace my old pads, but these things have grip! One of the really nice features of these brake pads (yes, I meant to use ""features"" and ""brake pads"" in the same sentence) is the angled tip. When the pads are properly aligned, it allows the rear tip to make light contact with the tire before the rest of the pad to squeegee water or gunk from the braking surface so the rest of the pad can grip. It works really well, but in my experience, it take just a bit of extra work to get the alignment right. If you don't, they will screech a lot, so it is well worth the extra few minutes."
5,Excellent Service,this was received on time. i absolutely love it. it is a great product. i can't wait to put it my bug out bag!
5,Keeps you guessing until the very last pages....AMEN!,"This is one of the few murder mystery novels in recent history that truly keeps the reader guessing ""whodunnit""! Using familiar elements, the Catholic church, New York City, the plight of the homeless and runaways, Edward Stuart weaves a story of suspense and horror in everyday life. From the discovery of the first corpse through the breathtaking chase at the end, you're hooked. Once picked up, it's hard to put down. Ease yourself into your favorite chair with a good cup of coffee and say a prayer...your in for the duration"
3,Too much hassle to return,"Water pump described in user guide never worked, had to resort to using garden hose drain. Window kit didn't fit well for standard window, had to devise makeshift insulation. Air hose doesn't fit well into window kit fixture, secured with duct tape. Seems to ignore remote control.Calls to Fridgidaire/Elextrolux weren't effective, they pointed me to local shops who recommended shipping it back (amazon). I may just purchase easy to return items from Amazon in the future.Effective at cooling a 15 by 15 room"
4,The Book is OK,The Book is quite ok for introductory courses as well as applications in Hydraulics. It is biased towards civil engineering and in my opinion is a book worthy to purchase.
4,This is a wonderful book that anyone will love.,"This book is one that brings to light the very real problem of learning disabilites in the schools today. Liz, Kevin's teacher, sees that sometimes behavioral problems are not always what they seem. Todd, Kevin's dad, proves that parents will do anything for their childeren even admitting to their own shortcomings. This is an emotional book that is extermley well written."
4,A Great Book,Grace Livingston Hill is a favorite author. We also like the older books. It is great when we find one is such good shape.
1,Unreliable and slow,"I am using this in a Mac running OS 10.3.8. If you already have previous versions of EndNote, e.g., 6.02, DO NOT upgrade. EndNote 8 is slow and unreliable and a waste of money. One area that I constantly run into trouble is the connection of EndNote to the PubMed server via the Internet. EndNote crashes frequently, and it seems to do so when Palm Desktop 4.2.1 is also running. If EndNote is finally connceted, it takes twice as long to download literatures as does v. 6.0.2. It is very frunstrating that new versions of the softwares do not aim at making themselves easy and reliable to use. Instead they add features that seem to benefit very few users. This is the key reason why I decide to write this review so that we can hold these companese responsible for their sloppy acts."
1,Still Nothing,Ordered. Order accepted. one month and 1 day later NOTHING has been delivered. Next step is to pull the credit card bill (due any day) and deny the charge. Following step will be to alert Postal authorities.
3,Good read,America's power has been humbled by a global tidal wave of terrorism. Its economic system is held hostage by a triumphant army of fanatics. Its leaders are paralyzed by indecision. Only one force remains to save the country and the world from total disaster. The Apocalypse Brigade.
3,Not Bad: but....,"...but I haven't read the book. This book is getting promoted by the promoter J. Mauldin which gives me pause.Some points to ponder:1. New Barbarian Manifesto by Ian O. Angell is much better. See my review of the same, which I actually read.2. J. Siegel shows a logarithmic curve that shows stocks are yielding about 6.5%/yr going back 200 years, even with the Great Depression, early 70s and late 90s bear markets. So there IS continuity, despite what the authors say3. If you want an excellent book on Free trade and Protectionism, see the new book by FT columnist and professor Martin Wolff4. The French say it best: THE MORE THINGS CHANGE, THE MORE THEY STAY THE SAME"
3,Good text but not enough photos,"This is a very good book text wise - very informative and written in an entertaining style. However, there are few photos and those that are there are small, grouped into sets of pages that are spliced into the book in sections. In my opinion, any book on something as spectacular as moths should have a much larger collection of photos. Yes, the information about them is important, but there is no substitute for a pictures - as the saying goes, a picture is worth a thousand words."
5,A lifesaver,"I bought this walker for my 82-year-old mom. It's light enough for me to lift into the back of my pickup. The large wheels make it easy for her to push around. I'm hoping the plastic break handles will hold up, so far they have. But the built in seat is the lifesaver! She can use it to rest whenever she wants."
4,ok but ..,"When folding walker missing more, is great for a trunk of a car, a little heavy, the person for whom the purchase is small in stature"
5,Big wheels & sturdy,"My father (who will be 105 next week) started using this model a few years ago. He really used it, as he still has projects he works on out in his shop, so he went back and forth frequently. We got this model from Walgreens. Then a wheel snapped off. He insisted he could fix it, but I went to Walgreens to buy one he could use until then. All they had were ones with small wheels and a ""floppy"" basket. It was quickly apparent that this was not going to work for him. The ""feel"" was flimsy and he couldn't carry a glass of water to his chair in the floppy basket. I got on-line and found this -- an apparent match to the older one. It's perfect. Sturdy, big wheels, wire basket. Highly recommended. (And the price wasn't that much more than the flimsy one.) Incidently, he was able to fix the wheel on the old one, so now we've got a spare. The flimsy one? I'm going to donate it to a local charity thrift store."
5,great walker,"This is a great little walker at a great price. Bought it for my 91 year old mother. She only weighs 90 lbs., so doesn't need a 300 lb. walker. It was easy to assemble, folds easy and she loves walking with it. Moves so much better than her old ""tennis ball"" walker. I decorated it so it is identified as hers and even ordered a bike license plate for it with her name. She feels special at her ""home"". If your not too tall or don't weigh alot, I would definitely recommend this walker."
1,UNHAPPY WITH SUNROOF WIND DEFLECTOR,ITEM CAME WITH NO INSTRUCTIONS TO INSTALL. SELLER WOULD NOT RESPOND TO EMAILS TO RETURN ITEM. VERY UNHAPPY WITH PURCHASE. FOR NOW ON I WILL BUY FROM THE STORE WHERE I CAN RETURN IT. POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE.
5,Great Hands-Free Lighting,"I use this light on my hat while fishing in the early morning and in the evenings after dark to rig tackle and bait. It's a bit heavy, but is very bright. It tilts easily to direct the beam just where I need it."
1,should've received my filter 8 days ago....should've bought it at the store,rediculously to long to wait. Does my 80.00 prime membership do anything? what is going on? Were is my air filter?
2,Too narrow,"Seat is too narrow and not made of sturdy enough material. However, it is easy to install. Do not recommend"
1,The designer did not do their homework. Failed,"I ordered the tolet set for my 95 year old father to use on a recent trip to see his 99 year old sister. We stay in a midrange hotel while visiting her. The tolets in the hotel are too low for him and since the handicap rooms will not work for other reasons I was hoping this would work.The seat did not conform to the lip inside the tolet and so when you tried to secure it it just popped out, I know I could not send it back since it is for a tolet, I am just stuck. Don't buy this, it is not versital enough to cover all applications.The idea might be good, but it needs to be tested on many different tolets before it is released for sale, at least 100's. Could you imagine an older or handicap person going to use this and it coming loose and the person falling and getting injured...."
5,Easy and comforting,I got this toilet seat for my grandmother who broke her wrist. She has had no complaints. It is a great relief for the family that she is able to be independent in the bathroom.
3,Tall seat,"The height of the seat is about one inch too high. My wife's feet do not reach the floor. I had to place a 1-1/2 inch block on the floor in front of the toilet so she could get up on the seat comfortably. A little caution is suggested when using the side arm rails for support. Putting too much weight on one side can pull the seat off of the toilet. Otherwise the seat works great and is of strong, quality construction."
3,"Good pan, deceptivly thicker in pictures","This is a good roasting pan and rack. The handles are very sturdy and when fully loaded their isn't very much flex. I found the rack equally adaquate. The only suprise was when unwrapped the thickness of the pan was not what I expected, thinner."
4,Sweet roaster - sweet price,"Roaster does a great job, looks nice too if you're worried about that. Cleans up well. Would be great if it were constructed out of a bit heavier gauged steel but for the price what should one expect. I originally wanted a Calphalon (big fan of their pans) but this was more budget friendly. I'd buy it again. As far as size, we have a 12 lb turkey at Thanksgiving and this was about as big as I'd go in this roaster, so if you routinely have large gathering at the Holidays and roast larger turkeys you might want to consider a larger model."
4,Great Pan but NOT for any Stovetop use,"This pan does not work well on the stovetop. As reported by other buyers, the heat does not distribute evenly and your drippings contents will burn not matter how attentive you are! I do not regret purchasing this pan. Because it is lightweight and of sturdy quality, it is perfectly adequate for other uses."
1,was barely 14 inches long!!!,"i needed a large 16+inch pan to serve lasagne to a group of 10that pan would have fed 6. was so disappointed. especially since it was even titled 161/2 inches!completely false name and description. it was, however deep enough, which is why i gave it one star. had to return it anduse my old granite ware roaster from 1930."
2,Not What I expected,"The pan was very light weight-not at all what I expected from Kitchen Aid. I returned it, which WAS very easy."
3,Second thought,"The price is just too good to be true, so without trying out I bought two of stainless roasting pan with stainless rack from different sellers. I was happy with the look and price until after about 10 uses, I'm not happy with the rack anymore because it's hard to clean at some connected parts. I'll be looking for a better design and better quality set soon."
1,WRONG SIZE in listing,"I'm sure this is a great roasting pan, but I am very disappointed that the listing inaccurately describes the product size. I needed a large pan, and decided upon this one since the listing says the ""Product Dimensions"" are 13x17.2x6. However these are the measurements of the BOX, NOT THE PAN. The Pan is actually 11.5x15x3.75 (without handles), which is significantly less than expected (only about 50% pan capacity). Looking to return it in search of a pan who's actual size matches the description."
2,wrong size,"the size of this is wrong. They say it's 16 1/2 in but that's from handle to handle. if you measure it from the pan , it's only 14 1/2 in. Very small"
3,You get what you pay for.,After reading all the reviews I decided to get this roaster. And the people that said it is to thin are right. It is structurally ok and it looks nice. As far as just roasting goes it's great but any cooking on the bottom is very difficult not to burn. If it was thicker it would be more versatile.
1,Product size is printed incorrectly,"Looks like a great pan, BUT I wanted a bigger one, the dimensions listed by Amazon as Product Dimensions: 13 x 17.2 x 6 inches ; 6.9 pounds. This is the size of the BOX it comes in. The pan itself is only about 11 X 15 X 4 (this is an approximate measurement) So be for-warned. I will be returning it for a larger pan.1 week later - I returned pan to Amazon, and am very pleased how easy it was, printed out shipping label and return documents from Amazon, took to UPS store, free shipping!!! Was credited promptly. I didn't think it would be that easy."
4,Just about big enough for a 14lb Turkey - but very thin material so not so good for gravy,We needed a new pan for Christmas dinner and this was a great value. The pan comes with a rack insert and was just about big enough for a 14lb Turkey with a little room to spare so might be able to get a 16lb in at stretch. The only negative is that the pan is very thin and so is not too good for making gravy on the stove after as the pan burns very quickly.
4,Like it but...,It works well as a roasting pan but the bottom is too thin for gravy making and saving the use of another pan. Slight disappointment but overall a nice roasting pan.
1,Not happy,"This pan is too flimsy. During first use when I tried to sear meat in it on the stove top on med-high heat before putting in the oven, the pan burned and buckled, and it did not brown the meat."
4,Bottom not flat,"I really love this pan except for one detail; the bottom of the pan is NOT flat which means that you can't put it on top of a glass top stove burner to make gravy (deducted 1 star for that). Other than the bottom, this pan is great. I used it NYE to make a 13 lbs. prime rib which was quite long and it fit in just right."
4,Nice,"This is nice, but it's not as heavy duty as I would like. The rack especially seems a bit...cheap. However, it has done a perfectly acceptable job with roasts, turkeys, and chickens so far. It's not a bad buy, and 50$ isn't bad. I am not sure how long it will last though."
4,Not wide enough,"I loved the original roasting pan I bought 4 years ago. In fact all of my sisters loved it. So for Christmas I bought this for one of my sisters. It is ""almost"" as good. However overall Product Dimensions: 13 x 17.2 x 6 inches stated did not seem to measure up to my pan. Good thing mine was coated and she got stainless steel finish. Thanks"
2,"Adequate, but I was expecting more...","I really like the roasting rack. It cradles turkeys and roasts very well, while not getting itself stuck to the meat during the cooking process.However, I was disappointed with the roasting pan itself. With it being KitchenAid Distinctions, I assumed it would be a thicker stainless steel like the rest of my set.I like to make gravy on my stovetop with the drippings, but I'm less confident turning my back on this pan for a few seconds to drain potatoes or something because, with the thinness of the pan, the heat does not spread throughout the bottom of the pan evenly. There are distinct hot spots.That said, the price was great. And I really do like the rack much more than any I've ever tried."
3,"Bottom not flat, thinner than expected","This is probably worth the price but I was quite disappointed to find that the bottom is not flat so it will not work on my flat-top stove for making sauces from the pan drippings. It is slightly indented with a slightly raised rim, therefore it does not make contact with the stove except at the edges. I'm sure this design was needed to add structural strength since overall the walls and bottom are quite thin (thinner than I expected) and would otherwise tend to warp. If you have a gas stove or a stove with raised burners, this would probably work fine. It is attractive and has a good rack."
4,Great roaster for a modest price,"Bought this roaster for our Thanksgiving turkey. It worked out wonderfully. It is not to heavy so when you get a 20 lb. turkey in it you can still lift the pan. It did a great job, nice browning, and the pan is easy to use with the stand up handles and easy to remove rack. It also worked wonderfully on top of the stove to make the gravy from the drippings. Couldn't be happier, I highly recomend this pan."
4,Excellent All Stainless Roaster With Rack,"Has the preferred, space-conserving vertical handles.Well made stainless steel roaster with stainless steel handles and with a stainless steel rack, preferred over a non-stick rack.More than adequate for the job and priced dramatically less than All-Clad."
2,Not as large as stated,"I wanted a roaster for a large turkey, but the pan I received is NOT the same dimensions--it's 12"", not 13, and 15-1/4"" long on the outside of the pan--not including the handles!. I haven't used it yet b ecause I haven't decided whether or not to return it."
4,good quality,Arrived promptly and in perfect condition. Have not used yet. Gift for husband who is going to use it to cook down maple syrup. Seems heavy and durable.
4,I like this book!,I thank Tomie DePaola for everything! He writes such beautiful multicultural tales. I read the story of the pointsetta for Christmas and will read this book for St. Patrick's Day. I will probably purchase his book on St. Patrick also.
3,"Soft Rock, California Style","The Guthrie Brothers make soft rock with a slight country twang that evokes seventies California sound acts like Fleetwood Mac, although they have more in common with Poco than The Byrds or The Flying Burrito Brothers. Close in style to the sort of country music turned out by Chris Hillman these days when he isn't doing the bluegrass thing. Nothing really wrong with them if you're into that sort of thing, but they tend to be cloying when they mean to be heartfelt, and thus border on the sickly sweet. Best track is `In The Eyes Of My Dad'."
4,Author is too favorable in his view of subject,"William Garrett Piston vehemently defends Confederate General James Longstreet from the authors of the Lost Cause, who claimed that the lieutenant general disobeyed General Robert E. Lee's orders at Gettysburg. The book is not a biography, and Piston emphasizes the history of the Lee Cult and their motives in making Longstreet the scapegoat for the Confederate's defeat. The author portrays Longstreet, however, too favorably. Piston contends that Longstreet acted honorably in many instances, but fails to give concrete evidence as to the general's true motives. The author is justified in several cases, but he relies too heavily on conjecture to make his claims that Longstreet was truly loved by his peers and subordinates. Although the book is well-written and thoroughly researched, Piston's argument is thus weakened by his love for his subject-matter."
4,AN EYE-OPENER TO POST-MILITARY POLITICS,"Generally, historians write battle engagements of Longstreet as slow-moving, and his preference to defensive strategy. This is particularly alleged for his part at Gettysburg but visiously-so by a few of Longstreet's contemporaries after Lee, who never publicly made such charges, had died. So, the author challenges the reader to consider the effects of politics that followed the war and resulted in Longstreet's ""tarnishment."" This book prompted me to read ""Lee and Longstreet at High Tide"" by Helen Longstreet, his second wife. With an obvious love-interest in preserving his reputation, she nevertheless makes very convincing and record-based arguments that basically support this book. I recommend her's as follow-up reading to this."
4,Apologetics: Justifying the ways of Longstreet to man,"This book reads like the doctoral dissertation of a graduate student: copious footnotes carefully documenting statements, and a thesis with ""point"" to be made. The writing, however, is not bone dry like many academic endeavors are, and this book is nicely crafted. Longstreet probably alienated many people with his irascible nature, but I do think he was justified in saying the same things that Lee himself said about Gettysburg: the decision to make Pickett's Charge was Lee's, against Longstreet's advice, and Lee properly took the blame for the defeat. Civil War enthusiasts will enjoy this book."
5,Greatest Corps Commander of the Civil War,"This is an excelllent book on James ""Old Pete"" Longstreet, Lee's right hand man and ""Old War Horse"". It is so good to see a scholarly work that gives General Longstreet the credit he deserves as one of the finest general of the Confederacy and certainly a more important general than the overated Stonewall Jackson. The author does an excellent job of reviewing Longstreet's war record and showing how his political enemies and the adherants to the ""lost cause"" rewrote history, falsely changing Longstreet from a hero to a scapegoat in one of the most unfair misrepresentations in history. This book along with Michael Saharra's ""Killer Angel's"" and 1993's film ""Gettysburg"" goes a great way in repairing this great man's standing in history."
3,Bad shipping case,While the tools came in perfect order the case however does not ship well. It was broken beyond use. The plastic does not stand up to your shipping methods. There needs to be better shipping packaging around the heavy tools. Also missing is the small tape pack shown in the picture. That however is a small concern. Might try having some foam injected between the top and inner layer of the case for stability with the heavy tools it is carrying.
4,Bach cello suites,"While this is considered a classic, my granddaughter for whom it was purchased found it disappointing"
2,BORING DEATH METAL,"This is boring as stuff, my friends. Yes, it is very brutal death metal, however it has monotonous vocals and monotonous riffs.Few good grooves, but overall picture is quite boring and not very inspiring.Just for huge fans of death/gore metal, who will grab anything brutal, other listeners may skip Devourment."
2,Beware - lens may not be as described,"The description of the 28-105mm lens says 'II USM or III', but beware many retailers, including the one on the amazon website as of 12/04, sell a lower quality lens (still EF 28-105mm, but with the MM class autofocus (slow and noisy and based around an electric motor driving a geartrain). The older lens is no longer sold separately by Canon, but is still in their ""beginner"" package as of 12/04. I have talked directly with the Amazon retailer, and their verbal claims are different than those on the amazon website. Beware! Also, this lens has plastic lens mounts."
4,Excellent value in an SLR camera,"I am still being dragged kicking and screaming into the digital age so my most recent SLR camera was a film one. For the money, I don't think it gets any better than the Rebel T2. It has most if not all of the features of similar cameras by Nikon or Konica/Minolta but at a much better value. The camera takes excellent pictures and the focus is very fast. If I had to pick something to complain about, I would say the FPS is not quite the 3 frames/second that is advertised, but it is still faster then any similarly priced camera. For those looking for a simple yet powerful film SLR for less money than even an average digital camera, this is a great choice."
2,Canon Rebel,Nice camera but it seems to take mirrored images. in other words the pics it takes are reversed. ????
5,Great Buy!,"I am very pleased with this camera. I am taking my first real photography class and this camera is perfect for such a class and for taking photos once I've finished the semester. I don't have to spend precious time trying to figure out which knob to turn or button to push. A quick read of the manual lets you know the basic functions and the camera really does a lot of the brain-work. The manual mode lets me fool around with things to get certain moods or feelings and the pictures are turning out great. A lot of the students are having a hard time reading their cameras' meters, but this camera's meter is really simple to read and very easy to see. The price was great and the quality is fantastic!"
5,Sweet deal!,"Got this a few weeks before my class to test it out. Works great. There are scratches on it, but doesn't matter with the quality of the pics. Seller was very nice also and packed it well. Highly recommended!"
5,Digital can NOT compare,"I tried digital. I really did. But I could never get the really gorgeous shots I got from my old Yashica SLR which gave up the ghost several years back. I also could not really ""focus"" on what I was shooting...just pointed and shot because there was no film to run out of. The result? Pointless pics that weren't even that good looking. Digital just didn't feel ""right."" So about 8 months ago I decided to go back to film. What to get? After much research, I finally decided on the Canon T2. Absolutely brilliant camera. My favorite feature? I can let the camera handle focus, etc. OR I can go COMPLETELY MANUAL. May not seem like a big deal, but it feels so good being in control of what the camera does when you want to be. And of course, that means letting your imagination go...something sorely lacking in digital. Couldn't be happier and no more pointless pics. Okay, maybe a few, but they still look good. And isn't that the point?"
5,Excellent health resource,"I highly recommend this book. I read widely about health and healing and I would consider this book one of the very best. Comprehensive info and very practical and clear.Healthy Healing: A Guide to Self-Healing for Everyone, 12th Edition"
2,Disappointed,"I'll echo the common complaint - this is really a very thick advertisement for Linda Page's products. It does have useful info, but you can get that from other books such as the venerable Nutritional Healing series. I bought it because I had my hands on a friend's copy, a much older edition, that didn't appear to have near as much of the self promotion."
1,Not a medical doctor.,"I read a couple of her books a few years back. You have to remember that she is not an MD but a naturopath and it's not recognized as formal medical training. I give her one star because she does have some helpful info. on herbs. You can also find this info. for free online. Yet, her books are designed to sell her Crystal Star line of products. You can find products way cheaper that are just as good. There are questionable rituals such as the vitamin c flush. Though vitamin c is an important vitamin, in mega doses as she prescribes, vitamin c can kick start the free radical process, which you don't want. Some of the herbs that she wants you to take much of, are too bitter and will cause an upset stomach. This book is ok to give you a general insight but one thing doesn't work for all and you can live healthy without the mega doses of herbs and vitamins."
5,Healthy Healing - Linda Page,"This book is one of the best in covering all aspects of holistic medicine. The first half covers a concise review of the many types of healing: homeopathy, chiropractic, aromatherapy, magnets, tai chi, etc. Separate sections instruct on healing foods, detoxification, and lifestyle therapy. The latter half has one whole page on each type of ailment, listing all pertinent foods, vitamins, enzymes, exercise, including brand names and amounts. If you are assuming charge of your own health, you cannot be without this book."
4,What a great textbook!,This is one of our required textbooks at the school I'm attending and it is structured in such a way as to make the information you need quickly easy to find.She also offers an entire section on protocols which helps you understand the steps you need to take for healing. Of course since Linda has her own line of products those are what she refers to and suggests but I wouldn't expect less of anyone who DOES have their own products to offer. You can always get your products elsewhere.I agree with most of what she writes here with a couple of exceptions but overall it's a great and very interesting read and I did recently refer to this book in an online podcasting expo I participated in.co-author of Whole Health for Happy Dogs
5,Great gift,"My son and his girlfriend are very interested in natural healing, so this was for a gift for her. It came sooner than projected and it will in excellent condition. I am so grateful to be able to click on a couple buttons and have products delivered to my door. Another birthday present is out of the way, and I know that she will be pleased."
5,Fantastic Book,I read this book from cover to cover. This is a must have book for optimal health. I bought one for everyone in my family for Christmas.
5,"Great options, not low fat!","This cookbook has many favorites included. We like to call it ""the stick of butter"" cookbook because so many recipes begin with 1 stick of butter. If you are not watching your weight or for special occasions, this is a real winner!"
2,Folk art,This wasn't my cup of tea and wasn't what I'd want in my back yard. The book was in good condition and arrived promptly. The content wasn't what I ws personally interested in.
2,Get it from the library,"Real estate mogul Josh Wyatt finds that he's tabloid fodder when racy photos of him are published, causing a bevy of scantily clad females to stalk him. To protect him from these would be ""Ms. Right Nows"" and the paparazzi, his lawyer arranges to hire a bodyguard. Not just any bodyguard will work - he hires Tess Franklin, an ex-cop who can hold her own with any perp, but will also have to act as his girlfriend. But Tess' overprotective father might have a little something to say about their living arrangements, particularly when he notices that his daughter is falling for her assignment.The characters are supposed to be 28-31, but both their thought processes are more in line with a 13 year old girl who can't decide if a boy likes her or not, which quickly became redundant. A minimal plot, lack of communication, and far too introspection made the eventual coupling pretty anti-climatic and unbelievable. I'd skip buying and get it from the library."
1,Awful!,"This is one of the worst books I have read in a long time. Josh has no personality at all and you wonder through the whole book how he became rich considering he is a total idiot. Plus, the characters change there mind so many times, it's impossible to figure out.who still wants who. All the two main characters is fantacize about explicit sex and the supporting characters are all just very annoying. Save your money!"
4,Great Pool Read,"This is a great pool read! A great story, although not the best I've read! I would suggest Janet Evanaovich if you like Tina Donahue."
4,looks good from pic & description on the site,"this is the first board ive seen that looks virtually like mine does, only it has gigabit ethernet instead of megabit (which i hope makes my internet way faster) and it has 8 usb ports instead of 7. ""image may not represent actual product"" is a very crazy thing for them to say though. i BETTER get what i order or thats false advertising and i will have to return it and receive a full refund from them."
5,Great Book,"The tales of wisdom, voodoo, spirituality, justice, and African culture narrated in ""Visions from the Dark World"" demonstrate how good and evil constantly struggle to dominate human existence. The author portrays the great cosmic battle between good and evil as a means of obtaining greater insight into human existence and awareness of possibilities presented by other dimensions.Prince Phillip Koko Ijoma does a stellar job of portraying how evil can lurk in the most innocent settings while good can exist in the most horrible settings. With snippets of ancient Ikot-Ana history interspersed throughout this well-written book the author vividly chronicles the chilling tales of horror, mystery, spiritualism, and voodoo that occur in rural Nigeria. The coming of age tales in ""Visions from the Dark World""is brilliant, exciting, fabulous, fantastic, fun, imaginative, interesting, suspenseful, uninhibited, and wild. This book truly captures the essence of Africa."
2,Frustration,"The game could've been a lot better. The most frustrating part of this game, was the terrible camera angles that you couln't control. The graphics was decent, it could've improved if it had better lighting/shadowing effect. I had trouble with depth and distance perception because of the lack of lighting/shadowing effects (I had problems judging jumping distances and height). And one other thing, the game was really short, it took less than 2 days to finish (this includes eating, sleeping, and other required activities).All in all... if you wanna play this game, go rent it, its not worth purchasing!"
1,JUNK!,"Toy Story 2 is a great movie, but not a great game! The graphics are barely decent, it's too hard to jump high, you can't fly, and it's too simple. I'm no super-beat-a-giant-game-in-two-days person, but this is simple! I beat it in one night! The graphics are so lame it's funny. During the last levels cutscene with Woody and Andy, Woody looks is a limp lifeless pile of pixels waving his arm! You also have to waste a giant chunk of your memory pak to save the game, even though all the cartridge needs to save is the number of tokens you got. This game is better to rent and beat, rather than buy and keep. ... Most of these games are ones that people bought instead of rented, and it was such a short game, they sold it ... for a refund. And what is the major game there? Toy Story 2, of course. Buy some good stuff at the same price like Banjo-Kazooie or Mario 64."
2,not that good,"I bought the game the day after I got a my nintendo 64. I was really excited. But... the graphics are disapointing, you can never tell where you are going because the camera is all over the place, and Buzz is hard to control. If you are older say 11 or above you could probably play this. But kids at that age are not interested in that type of game. Now a little one who's going to really want it is going to get very frustrated with the game. It's VERY disapointing. Little kids will not be able to beat the some-what difficult levels. But... the levels are accurate to the movie and Buzz's voice is excellent"
3,Toy Story 2,"Toy Story is a game that you play for fifteen minutes and then get bored of it. The graphics are o.k. and the sound effects are all right. But kids that loved the movie will adore this game. You meet up with other characters from the movie some of which give you advice, others ask you for help. It's the same idea as Mario, you collect coins and fight bosses at the end of the level. But instead of getting stars you get pizza planet tokens which are used for video games at pizza planet, a pizza restaurant. Sometimes you must move things to climb up on boxes or tables. I rate this game a three out of five stars because it could have had a better plot but still was a sucess."
4,soooo much fun,"This game is so much fun.I love it.I like all the thngs you cando on it like shoot lazer beams and spin around with your wingsout to blow up bad toys.I think this game is great for kids 6-9.This game is really great.And Rex gives you hints where peopleare.I think this is a really great game even though I only gotto level 5.as far as I'd say, this is a really great game."
3,Try Before You Buy!,"This is an average game, that's it. You play as Buzz. It's ok but you can find a lot of better adventure games for the N64. Rent it, see what you think, then decide. I have no additional feelings about this game."
2,A poor offering for younger players,"I bought this game for my son, 6. The graphics are dismal (comparedto SuperMario 64 - which he just loves). One is apt to feel sea-sickwhen playing it. Camera angles are poor. Fine control of Buzz's movements is poor. If you feel you must buy it, I would advise renting it for a few days first. END"
1,ok,The game is ok not worth anything over $5.00 us of course its ok thought if you dont want to invest in newer items
4,Great way to see the country.,"This is a very economical way to enjoy the country that is Finland. Keep in mind that there are many places to cover, so not much time is spent on individual locations. The videography is quite lovely and really brings out the natural beauty of the landscape. The only drawback is the narration. I wish the voice-over artist actually knew how to pronounce the place names. It got to be quite distracting after the first few errors. Finnish is not that difficult to pronounce. The same rules apply each time. Perhaps next time, if there is a newer version, the producers could enlist the help of a native Finn! For anyone who is not so particular about the pronunciations, this is still a great way to visit Finland."
3,Not worth much but there's not much out there about Finland.,"Agree with other reviewer. The English accented speaker doesn't seem appropriate. And since Finland has such awesome outdoor scenery it's a shame the producers didn't choose to show more of this. As it is, this video is mainly a quickie look at 200 yr-old buildings in many Finnish cities. Not worth much money, but, then, there aren't too many Finnish DVD tour guides out there, so it's better than nothing. Buy it USED from Amazon--it's not worth buying a new copy."
1,A Real Lemon,Maybe I have just been unlucky but the first one of these A/C units that was delivered worked for one day and died. The replacement unit that Haier sent pumps out cold air for the first 20 minutes of operation and then the compressor turns off never to turn on again. Two broken A/C units in a row. That has to be more than coincidence. When I did a search on the internet I found many other extremely negative reviews of this Haier model. I'm going to cut my losses and buy a different manufacturer's A/C for my bedroom. I wanted to give this product no stars since neither of the two units I received worked but the review software wouldn't let me proceed without selecting at least one star.
2,Disappointing book! Not pocket-sized and strange transliteration system.,"I am very disappointed in this dictionary.... It has a strange transliteration system that just doesn't make sense compared with other transliterations that I have encountered in Thai langauge classes and other dictionaries. Plus, it is not small! it is about 6 or 7 inches length-wise... not what I would call pocket-sized. Finally, it has very limited listings (only about 3000 words!), and seems to be missing about half of the words that I want to look up in it! I recommend buying a different dictionary, but I still recommend having one when your plane touches down because even this dictionary that I dislike so much has saved me a few times!"
3,Thai Dictionary,"as a pocket dictionary, I did not expect this one to be exhaustive, and yetthere were several simple words not in there, or the Thai was in the front,but I couldn't find it's reciprocal in the English section (they had someother Thai word for the same thing, but not one I was familiar with.)Also, the I thought the English selection was 'slim-pickins', and did not havesome of the more common words I wanted to see. However, I did like their useof the Thai alphabet, so that if I wanted to learn the language a little, thisbook would be helpful. So, tho it wasn't as extensive as I hoped, I still don't regret getting it."
4,"Easy Going, Easy Listening","This is a very mellow, relaxing CD. It's not acoustic worship and it's not the same old songs people are remaking. Although the artists are varied, they all keep the same 'vibe' throughout the CD, keeping it from being choppy for the listener. I heard this while shopping in the bookstore, and bought it immediately. I bought it for the music, not because such and such artist is on it, so if you are into artists..you will like this even more. The songs have lots of repetition, like a worship CD without 'being' a worship CD if you know what I mean. I really like the title track ""Traveling Light""; that one deserves some radio play!! It's very healing and nurturing music. I play it at work at all day at my computer."
4,Better than expected.,"I bought this only for Jaci Velasquez's In Green Pastures. However, I was not disappointed in this CCM album.Stand Outs are: Traveling Light, I Shall Not Want, In Green Pastures, I Will Not Fear, Let It Flow, and Rest In Me. These songs encompass the Spirit of the 23rd Psalm."
4,Sharp photos!,"I recently purchased the Rollei Prego 140mm 35mm camera (in place of the Leica Z2X as my 1st option & at that time, out-of-stock) & was very satisfied with the sharp images it took. However, I found the viewfinder a bit too small, sometimes hard to find, & the casing, a bit ""cheapy"", which makes it really light to carry on the other hand. I guess, you can't have it all. For the sharp pictures the camera took, I can overlook the camera's not-so-important ""inferior"" features, although for the price you pay for it, you'd at least expect better craftmanship."
2,"Good concept, but doesn't work well","My son who is four really wanted this toy, as he loves to bowl; this toy has a great concept, but it doesn't work well. He had to get right up to the pins, (3 inches away)and slam them in order to knock them over. Almost all of us tried it. It is almost impossible to knock the pins over. The balls are very small and light, but I don't think that was it, he practically had to hit the pins with his hands in order for it to work. Even another ball didn't work well. Wish the pins went up better. We bought ""Silly Pins"" and that is a hit. Very funny, very do-able."
3,Altars of the World,Very interesting but dated. Presented in a very open minded way for the viewer to draw their own conclusions. I will be showing this to a Comparative Religions class.
4,It's really cool.,I bought this game and love it I have played it thriugh entirely at least like 10 times. You have 3 ships all have special powers (i suggest the 3rd one it's my favorite) and you can earn a forth one. Once you beat all of the missions you get the original asteroids and a new ship. I highly recommend this game.
5,WOW - WHAT A STORY,This is an early Joan Johnston book. It is just GREAT. Sparks fly between Jesse and Honey. A thoroughly enjoyable romantic story.
5,Extremely Helpful,"I am a homeschooling mom of two elementary children. I have three other books in this collection and always loved the information and ideas they have. I was happy to see that I could order one of the books I didn't have from Amazon as a kindle edition. What great service for a busy mom who doesn't always have the time to go to the book store. I also love the confirmation e mails Amazon sends, very thorough transaction. I for one am completely satisfied.W"
5,Guide to 2nd Grade,"I love this series of books and recommend them to all parents. I use them to review concepts with my own children to ensure that they have the basic understand of concepts needed for their grade level. I often review with them over the summer. In addition, it has many things that are overlooked during the school day as a teacher only has so much time. I particularly appreciate the fine arts, cultural literacy, and geography sections of these books. This book is not a complete curriculum but rather an overview of the minimum amount of knowledge your child should have at each grade level."
4,Great Resource!,"Great Resource!We are temporarily residing outside of the US, and the school our child attends, follows British Curriculum, while the two Curriculums are very similar, there are some differences. This book helps me make sure that he is exposed to the same concepts his American peers are."
5,A fantastic resource for homeschooling.,"The entire Core Knowledge series (K-6) of books is tremendous. Each one covers: Language and Literature, History and Geography, Visual Arts, Music, Mathematics, and Science. Throughout the book you will also find lists of recommended resources that may be used as supplementary material. Another great feature is the Familiar Sayings (e.g. Easier said than done) section. You won't be disappointed with this book."
5,Works good on a Panasonic PV-GS85,I used this battery for five one hour tapes before the camera indicated it should be charged. It works very well on my Panasonic PV-GS85.
5,Lenmar Camcorder Battery,"The original battery died on our Panasonic camcorder and we were looking for another. I was also hoping to find something with a better battery life. This is a little bulkier than the original - it sticks out the back some. But the battery life is fantastic. I've still on the original charge and that was about 3 months ago and 2 hours of tape later. A good, cheaper alternative. Would recommend."
4,Outstanding,Even though I thought this wouldn't fit my camera it did and it worked perfectly. Now I don't have to worry about the battery running out.
1,Satisfied,"If I could change the rating to FIVE STARS, I would. The first time I bought this item, the disc was missing. Although I was upset, I opted for a replacement. I'm glad I did, because this is a nicely produced video. I'm very satisfied. I'm looking forward to watching and applying the tutorials to my future works."
2,Plastic bits,"This product looks so nice, but it does have an inner tray that breaks off little plastic bits into the leaves of the vegetable as you spin it. This will apparently continue happening until all those bits break off. They only seem to break when you have something inside it. You won't want to serve your salads until this no longer occurs."
1,"Hard to use, and pieces break off","We have been using our trusty OXO spinner for years and years, and when it finally gave out we thought we'd try a different brand. From the first use, this item was very hard on the wrists, and after the very first spin, pieces of the internal plastic strainer started coming off. Thanks to amazon's great return policy we're returning this, and going back to the tried and true OXO."
4,If you need this - it works,This product has helped provide the stability I needed to allow my Achilles tendon to heal. Delivery was exceptional and the product is superbly made.
5,The Only Strap Big Enough,I have bad Achilles Tendons in both feet. This Strap can be ordered by size as all otherachilles straps are One Size Fits All. The others are way too tight. Great Item because ofof the variable sizes.
4,More comfortable than it looks.,"I could wear it with all my shoes and it fit well under a sock so the beige wouldn't show with work pants. I wish it came in black, too. I have a history of achilles tendonitis and knew when it started acting up I better do something to avoid months of pain and physical therapy. This did the trick! I bought it with the foot rocker which also helped."
4,Twndon Strap,"Hurt my achilles playing softball and purchased this strap for additional support, It works just like it was designed. Using even now."
3,Great for beginners,"I really enjoyed the setting and the instructors voice and shape.This is my 2nd pilates video, I got a workout, but not as intense as my first.I like it but it does nto have a lot of variety. It is for beginners, just simple and too the point. There is one workout broken down into 2 pieces, thats it. That is the only thing I don't like, not enough variety. I guess I will try an intermediate version, it may be just that simple. I want a little more challenge and longer workouts with variety."
1,Not for Beginners!,"This is the second Elements DVD I have purchased. The first was Beginners Yoga. Neither the Pilates DVD nor the Yoga DVD are truly for *beginners*. If you have NEVER done pilates- if you really want to tone up but are out-of-shape, this DVD is NOT for you. I didn't realize that I had purchased yet another Elements DVD, and I will be more careful NEXT TIME. If you need any sort of modification, she barely addresses this. I think ELEMENTS has gotten truly CONFUSED about the word _BEGINNERS_ - both on their beginning yoga DVD and most certainly on this one. If you are wanting to tone up using pilates and have anything like fibromyalgia - or are just wanting to START a program to tone up in the privacy of your home- I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS ONE. If you've neglected exercise and are not already fairly strong in your abdominal area, you won't even be able to do this DVD. It, as I said, is not for people who are just starting on an exercise program."
2,beginners??,"The opening section of this DVD was doable, but the main part was very difficult -- I find it hard to believe that complete beginners could do all of these exercises. I gave up about halfway through, and I'm a fit, athletic person who does a lot of biking and walking. For women, I recommend the Belly-Dancing for Beginners (fat burning), which, although it sounds silly, is much more enjoyable to do, and it really works you out. --Halfway through this DVD I began to resent the trainer, since it seemed as if she was just showing off and didn't care if we could keep up with her."
4,Great workout!,"Great DVD. Very easy to do, definetly for beginners at Pilates. Surely felt it afterwards in EVERY muscle. Love it!"
3,Not For Beginners,"If You're been introduced to Pilates but haven't been fully trained, this is perfect for you.. I was completely green when i ordered this, It is not for Beginners at all. I do recommend this DVD, she speaks clearly and waits for the viewer/participant to catch up. Well paced and easy to follow.. But definitely not for beginners.. !!!"
4,Very Good Beginners Video!!!!,"I have to be honest the first time I did this DVD I couldn't finish the whole video and I was sore the next day! I really didn't realize how out of shape I was, but I kept at it and every time I did it I was able to do more and more. I think it is a very good beginners video and I really enjoy the workout. Just don't give up!"
5,You're going to feel it everywhere!,"This workout DVD was awesome! I have been looking to transform my current regimen (weight lifting, treadmill pounding, and endless crunches/ab work on the floor) to something more peaceful. I am going to mix this with element ballet conditioning and swimming to keep the impact on my joins low (I have had acl reconstruction) This is exactly what I was looking for. The entire workout focuses on correct breathing and technique which combined with intense focus gave me a great workout. I think, when done properly, this is a good workout for anyone, whether you are in great shape or just starting out."
5,Good Purchase,"Instructor talks you through entire workout, so you don't have have eyes glued to the tv. I feel really good after the workout!"
3,Way too slow and easy,"While there were some good basic moves, it felt like this was even too beginner for beginners. The pace was too slow and felt like I could have gotten more out of the time dedicated to this workout."
2,Couldn't Connect with It,"I bought this DVD expecting it to be a low key toning workout, but had a hard time following the instructor. I attempted the routines a few times but I honestly didn't feel like I was engaging - or even flexing - any of the muscle groups she was referring to."
5,One part easy; one part hard!,"This DVD comes in 2 parts that can be played consecutively or one at at time. The first part is the Pilates-inspired cardio workout and is relatively easy, yet is still a nice well-rounded workout that breaks a sweat and gets the heart pounding a little. The second part, focusing on mat-work, is a very difficult (for me) gut-busting workout from hell, which perhaps someday I will be able to do, but certainly not now. However, even if I do just half of the mat-work (quitting halfway through the routine or holding the poses for just half as long), I still get an intensive and needed toning of my abs."
4,Hard to do it has potential,"First impressions: it is pretty challenging.My background: Mid 20s, always been overweight, but recently I've been dieting and started to exercise.I've never done Pilates or yoga before; only walked, or used the elliptical/treadmill at the gym.While this DVD may be challenging for beginners, I think that I will get a lot of out it after using it for a while.The instructor gives good instructions, and I find it calming. I do have lower back pain since childhood, so I'm worried that it will get aggravated.I will update this in a few weeks!"
4,a good work out,"I am new to pilates, but this seems to be a pretty good work out. I didn't think that it was doing anything when I was working out. The next day, however, I was really sore."
4,Enjoyable and challenging,"I have never ever done Pilates before...but I was extremely interested in starting. After reading numerous reviews on other DVD's, I chose this one and I am glad that I did. I found this to be a great introduction to Pilates, but also challenging as well. I am getting over a hip injury and found this to start out at a good pace that definitely picks up towards the end of the workout. I am really excited to be able to do this routine going forward, and will be looking for a few more later on when I get better at it!"
5,Perfect Pilates workout for me,"I picked up this DVD after seeing all the good reviews for it out here on Amazon; it seemed to be exactly what I was looking for. And as usual, Amazon reviewers have done me a good turn yet again. :) This is a fantastic DVD from Brooke Siler, a very knowledgeable instructor, and though it claims to be for beginners, I can honestly say that as a lower intermediate student there's still several exercises that will continue to challenge me, i.e. push ups and plank, or that will always make my abs BURN no matter how far along I progress. That said, this routine is still very approachable to Pilates beginners since Brooke gives instruction quite clearly and precisely, so that even if you can't perform all the exercises successfully at first, it definitely gives you something to work towards. A worthy addition to your exercise DVD collection!"
2,NOT for beginners!,"I bought this DVD looking for a good introduction to Pilates. I dance, walk, and do yoga, so I am somewhat fit, but I am new to Pilates.The first half of this video, Pilates-inspired cardio, is a nice 18-minute routine. It's a little too short, but it does increase the heart rate while toning and lengthening muscles. It was an accessible, enjoyable workout.Most of the DVD is a ""beginner"" Pilates workout. I was clearly going to end up frustrated and/or injured, so I stopped. When I told a friend who is a Pilates instructor about the exercises, she agreed that they are not moves for Pilates beginners. She mentioned that some of the exercises, particularly the Scissor, could cause low back injury.Proceed with caution."
4,Challenging and not too long,"My Pilates teacher suggested Brooke Siler's books as a good way to practice at home. I was a little put off by the idea of ""cardio"" Pilates, but once I did that section I enjoyed it and felt like it was aerobic without sacrificing the idea of concentration and core. Doing both programs (the cardio section and the mat section) gives a good total body workout without wiping you out for the whole day."
4,Pilates Weight Loss for Beginners,Always felt I was more of a pilates person than yoga person as I naturally stretch. Working on a computer all day means quite often tired up through the shoulders and neck. This work is hard but really opens up these tight areas - get a great release. Reckon I will only get stronger and slimmer as I continue to work out with this DVD
2,Element: Pilates Weight Loss for Beginners,I found this workout to be pretty boring. It may be because I've been working out with yoga and cardo dvd's that this just didn't move like I prefer. I think you really need to be a BEGINNER and you may enjoy it.
4,Great Beginner DVD,This was my second pilates dvd and I really enjoyed it. I found the routine easy to follow and challenging. I look forward to trying more of her advanced workouts.
1,This Pilates DVD does not deliver at all,"the dvd does not deliver (let alone weight loss) - very little content, not much to go on in general, only two short sessions, if you decide to call standing and mat workout different sessions; annoying music (would like to turn it off), poor screen resolution, i do not recommend this video"
3,Its So-So,"This DVD is just so-so. I thought it was going to be alot different. It just wasn't motivating. I need to be motivated to stick to my workouts. If you have lower back or neck issues and a weak midsection, I wouldn't recommend this DVD.I will admit that I ""felt"" it the next day. Everything was sore. My triceps, abs, hamstrings, you name it, it was sore. The pain in my neck and low back, just wasn't worth all of the work i got in the other areas. It's So-So..."
1,I never received this product. Received a CD that I did not order instead.,I ordered this product but recieved a much older CD rather than the DVD shown here. I do not havethe money to send it back (I already paid shipping to get it) so I am stuck with something I cannot use.
2,Not so good!,"I got this DVD thinking it would really work for me but when I watched the DVD I did not feel motivated to work out. It feels like you are just listening to a long narration. Brooke Siler may be good at what she does, but this DVD fails to connect with the audience. I was bored!!"
2,Not a Favorite,"This is a narrated video, and lacked excitement. I was not impressed with explanations, or lack there of. I am an intermediate level Pilates, and was not impressed with this video. I put this DVD in one time, and never touched it again."
2,Very surprised by all the great reviews....,I would consider myself an advanced begginer when it comes to exercising. And I am sorry but I felt like this dvd was just way too easy. I felt no burn while I was doing the exercises and my heart rate barely went up I didn't even break a sweat. I wouldn't recommend it to people who want a really good workout. I think this more for people who are completely out of shape who can't do much exercise.
4,Beginners my butt!,This is definitely a work out! It is not for beginners. It is very fast paced and some of the positions you are in are very hard to do! I was out of breath!! If your experienced at pilates then this is a great workout! If you are a beginner go for the total body pilates with the mini-ball from element!
3,it's ok,"I like it, the moves are easy to follow and it has a low cheesiness factor. My only complaint is I don't really feel like I've done enough after, the course is long and after wards I'm not really sore. I don't really enjoy working out so when i do I want to be sure I'm getting something out of it. I will continue to use but I'm alternating with other videos, like Jillian's 30 day shred which I really enjoy, you are in no doubt that you did something."
1,36hrs,"All of the ratings I've come across were excellent for this elph...unfortunately I would have to strongly disagree. I bought the camera specifically for a trip to Europe and it broke on the second day. The 25 shots or so that I did take were ok, but with no consistency. Half of the pictures were beautiful the other half were out of focus."
2,"Excellent, but...","My wife and I bought this camera two years ago, before our first child was born. We've been very happy with its performance, and found the picture quality much better than other cameras. In the last few months, however, the camera no longer accepts new rolls of APS film. Instead, it changes the cartridge from ""new roll"" to ""exposed,"" without taking any pictures. We brought this camera to the camera shop, and they told us that it was a common problem with this model, and that it would cost [a lot] to have it repaired. We then called Canon, and they did not admit or deny the history of this problem. They just told us that the new Z3 did not seem to have the same issues.Overall, we really like this camera. We're probably going to try the Z3, however, for our next camera. ..."
1,Buyer beware of this camera!,"I received this camera as a gift 2 and a half years ago and loved it during most of that time. The problem with this camera is that once the warranty expires, the camera will soon follow! It started flashing 'H' (meaning the camera no longer works) shortly after the warranty expired. Good luck getting any help from Canon, after months of trying, they wouldn't help out at all. They won't even tell you what is wrong with it unless you agree to pay them for repairs! Search the web and you'll find this happens to everyone. This camera is junk and you should avoid it like the plague..."
3,"Not Great, but not bad either !","Small, convenient, and easy to use. Pictures are good. I had the Flashing H problem also. I took out the battery and the film. Turned the camera on, snapped a couple of shutter releases to drain any leftover power. Put the battery back in and loaded a new roll of film. The H went away. I had tried this a couple of times before; but I set the date and time prior to loading the film and the H was still there. I don't know if this will work for your camera, but it's worth a try."
4,"A ""gotta have""","Friends generously lent me their Canon 370Z to take on my vacation. It was wonderful -- very easy to learn and very easy to use. The pictures have been processed and they came out very well. I loved the flexibility of photo sizes and the ease of using the telephoto feature. I came home and ordered one for myself. In fact, several of the friends with me on my trip plan to do the same. Seeing this camera in action definitely turns it into a ""gotta have""."
5,A Good All-Around APS Camera,"I've had and used q 370Z for over a year, and I've never had a bad snapshot that wasn't the photographer's fault. Yes, I sometimes get red-eye in low light, but a lot of that is caused by the compactness of the camera - the flash is too close to the lens to avoid ALL red-eye. Increasing the room lights helps. Other family menbers have had a series of 35mm Point-and-shoots, but the 370Z is better. Reliable (at least for me), simple to use, with a zoom range that goes from true wide-angle (most don't) to portrait-length telephoto (the regular ELPH doesn't). I still have my 35mm SLRs and 7 lenses for ""serious"" photography, but it sure is easier to carry the ELPH 370."
5,Great Music...,"I'm not really into this kind of music, but I absolutely love his cd. The music is great and I love his style."
4,Thomas Fanatic,"Both of my boys love Thomas. I really scored when I found this Thomas puzzle. The puzzles is built to take the abuse of a 2 & 4 yr. The box that it comes in, is a bit of pain to get all the tabs undone to get to the puzzle. Cute box, but a pain.M.G."
3,Fun Puzzle but maybe too easy,My 3 year old nephew loves the puzzle but it might not be challenging enough because he's able to solve the puzzle very quickly.
4,Pretty good puzzle for little ones,"My 3 year old likes this puzzle (she loves the Thomas character) and really enjoys doing this one. The color is bright and the picture is interesting. This one is a great starter for kids learning how to work with puzzles. I gave 4 out of 5 only because this one isnt as challenging as some other 24 piece puzzles... though that doesnt seem to deter my youngster, who puts it together daily."
3,not the quality I expected from Ravensburger,We got this floor puzzle yesterday and I am disappointed by the quality of the pieces. They are mat and not glossy and I am afraid after a few days they wear. I paid $15 plus tax but I believe it is worth less than $10 so buy only if you get it on discount. The cute box also started to show signs of wear....
2,Informative but too angry,"Very well researched but the author obviously has a chip on his shoulder. He takes every opportunity to blast the U.S. Government (sometimes rightfully so) but the book would be much more bearable if he would just present the facts without taking every opportunity to play-up how the upper-class Americans oppressed, exploited and took advantage of the lower-class (Indian and African workers). I was looking for a book that presented a comprehensive history but the author is just too angry to be taken seriously."
2,Thank you USA for leaving those shooting ranges,"Interesting book but as somebody concerned with Panama's environment I can only be happy the US left the shooting ranges 'as is', in compliance with the Canal treaties (a school is a school, an office is an office, a shooting range is a shooting range).Thanks to ""the disposal of the tens of thousands of explosives it left"" these area are now reclaimed by the jungle and its natural inhabitants and will not be subject to greedy developers and corrupt polititians in Panama who have zero respect for nature.It's often ignored in books like these that a superpower can only do what it does thanks to the cooperation of the corrupt local elites - including those in the academic world - that are more concerned about their own pockets and position than the interest of the country."
2,A Real Disappointment,"Why can't some people write honest and balanced history?The author has obviously done a lot of research, but his vitriol and one-side interpretation of virtualy every U.S.-Panamanian event diminishes the effect his book could have had.What a shame. There is a story to be told but this is not the book to accomplish that.Shame on you for using your intelligence in such a negative fashion. Grow up, consider all the facts and stop being a propagandist.I am not angry just very disappointed.*****************Professor Mellander established Latin American Area programs at several universities. He is the author of the critically acclaimed, ""The United States in Panamanian Politics."""
5,Callas shines in Puccini,"It's already been said, this is one of the best Puccini aria recitals. Callas adopts just the right colour for each of the characters she undertakes in this recital. That said, the selections on this disc are mostly the same as those found in her ""Puccini Arias"" recital, and the masters in that disc are the ones utilized here. In addition to those arias, ""Vissi d'arte"" and the duet ""Non la sospiri"" from Tosca (2002 remstering), ""O soave fanciulla"" from La Boheme, and ""Vogliatemi bene"" from M.Butterfly (1997 remastering) are also included, though the duet from Tosca doesn't end naturally in my opinion, because it's just a part taken from the entire love duet from Act I. The performances themselves are highly commendable, and thus make this (or the previously released ""Puccini Arias"") a must have CD."
3,"Not the best, but still good","James Newton Howard, to me, breaks down into three categories: Action, Children, and M. Night Shyamalan. Pretty much anything he does originates purely from one of these categories, or is a mixture of some or all.I personally enjoy his more imaginative work for the M. Night films, they have a deeper, darker, more psychological feel. Hidalgo didn't get close. He did however succeed in creating a reasonably decent action score for what was a reasonably decent action movie.Few tracks stand out from the CD's thematic ambiguity, but the two most notable themes are ""The Race Begins"" and ""The Final Three"". ""Montage"" is also a likable piece.For the diehard fans of Howard, I suppose this is a must-have. I buy scores before I see the film itself, so I felt somewhat duped, but after a while it grew on me. It might for someone else too..."
4,Great toy for travel or church,"We really enjoy this eye spy bag. My son is 4 and loves to hunt for the items. My only complaint is that the tag ripped off within 5 seconds and the items are listed not printed as pictures. This poses a problem for younger children that can't read yet. I solved my own problem though. I opened the bag, pulled out all the little pieces and took pictures of them. I did one picture for the smaller pieces and one for the larger. I taped them together back to back, laminated it, and attached it to the bag. It works great!"
5,Three Years of Fun,"Loved it!!!! My husband and I have played this game off and on for 3 years. We finally finished it. We loved laying in bed taking turns. Our 3 year old started playing it when he was 2 1/2. We saved all the levels, so he could play at each level. Now he can get to most levels on his own. Even though we finished the game, we still go back to levels that we did not get everything and try to get them. Years and years of enjoyable fun. Need more games like this!!!!"
2,Disney & Pixar should stick to making movies,"I got this game because my 3 year old son loves Toy Story and always wants to watch me play playstation. I figured this would be perfect. He thinks it's amusing when Buzz falls down, which is a lot. The controls are so lousy that performing simple tasks such as running straight across a beam or board is very difficult. The camera almost never lets you see where you are going, so you fall off objects this way too. It's way too frustrating to play because even completing these tasks isn't rewarding, you just move on to more. You can't see where you are going, over jump objects all of the time, and fall from places that are a pain in the [behind] to get to anyway. If I want a game that's difficult, it should be hard to figure out or there should be tough battles. Walking and jumping should not be the challenge. UGH!"
2,very frustrating game,"I bought this game for my 7 year old son, expecting it to be a good one. The graphics are average (better graphics can be found with Spyro, year of the dragon), and the levels are very frustrating, I found myself throwing the controller away several times trying to help my son get through the levels, even though I consider myself a good gamer. I finally recommended my son to play Spyro the dragon instead to avoid anymore frustrations. I won't recommend anyone to get this game."
1,Are you people on drugs? This is a horrible game.,"This is, without a doubt, one of the WORST games I've ever had the displeasure of playing in my 20+ years of avid gaming. I'm sure it would be good for children that don't know any better, but seriously folks, this is awful. Movie franchise games have always had a bad reputation, and this doesn't help. Clunky, awkward controls and camera, blocky graphics, horrible story, unimaginative and confusing level design, and dull gameplay sink this game. I know that most people will read this review as being too harsh or analytic for a children's game, but heed my words: this game is awful. Even when taken as a purely children's-oriented game, it's awful. Too confusing for children (what 5-6 year old is going to understand ""active and passive camera""? A great franchise like Toy Story deserves better than this. I realize that this game was made about a decade ago (give or take a couple years), but still. It goes beyond dated. Don't ever buy this game."
1,"This game is very, VERY bad","Packed with ugly graphics, boring and slow gameplay, Toy Story 2 is an game that really sucks. The movie was boring, but this is worse. Disney/Pixar and Activision made an terrible diaster in every level, combining ugliness, boredom, stupidy and gameplay so bad that it is more boring then Spice World, which is an historical Lame-Game. Don' t buy it, Don' t try it, AVOID IT!!!!!!!!"
5,Top of the art,Toy store is the best plastation game ever. with action it is the best in the world . It is the top of the art .
3,Poor description,"This is probably a good item, but has a poor description. There is no way this light can be mounted into a round pole. I even called the company, and they said nothing can be done. Just be sure you have a square pole if you purchase this light."
5,Slight Confusion,the Platform listed says WindowsXP Home Edition but the one i received is the Xbox version. now that would be fine but i dont have an Xbox. also i chose the cheapest used one so its not even worth sending back.
2,poor gaming for pc,"has graphic glitch right out of the box. there is a downloadable fix at gamespot but the character is still difficult to control. I use a six axiz ps2 style controller. tommy wlks and runs but the cars will not go forward or reverse using controller, you have to use keyboard controls for the cars and game controller for all else. there is no way to set the controls for the car. If you want to play this game i strongly recomend playing the ps2 version."
2,Disappointed,I bought these lights to fill in the black holes left and right of the single narrow high beam halogen headlamp on a 2008 Triumph Sprint ST. Not much help because the beams are not focused; a lot of light scatters to the sides and overhead; little reaches out to 100 ft. Small size does make for flexible installation options.
3,lights but wrong bracket,"The lights seem to be the same as are shown for various ""kits"". However, I can find no specifics describing what is in various ""kits"" for different applications, and the lights are apparently the same for each. Is the wiring harness different in different ""kits"" ? Who knows? No specifics are offered. Are the mounting brackets different? Who knows? Only hard -to-see pics are offered. Apparently the brackets are different. I ordered lights to mount on a BMW R1200GS. I ordered the mounting bar from PIAA. It was fine, but the bracket that came with the light kit would not work with that light bar. So can I just buy the correct brackets? Who knows? Apparently not. Can't find that on PIAA website. This kind of hassel and frustration is not worth it. Amazon would onloy allow me to return the product but offered no assistance with making the bracket situation right. Are the lights good? Who knows? Can't mount them to see if the work...."
4,"Very bright, easy to attach, wiring took some time to figure out","I installed these in my 2007 Nissan Frontier pickup.On the positive side, the lights were BRIGHT, the beam pattern was terrific, and they fit perfectly. They are designed to be wired directly to the high beam lead, and I had very little difficulty locating the right electrical connections and performing the installation.On the negative side, the included switch was a poor fit for my vehicle. I bought a switch at Radio Shack for a few bucks, drilled into a blank insert in my dash, and installed it there instead of the whole double-stick-tape route.The lights were a bit difficult to aim, and I had my mechanic do it for me."
5,Wonderful rack,"I use this rack to hold my indoor plants- it lets plenty of light in, it can handle getting water dripped on it, and holds all 20 of my plants, plus fertilizer etc. It looks great, it's sturdy, and it came in one piece, so the only assembly was to swing the shelves into place. Very good purchase."
5,Awesome product,"I decided to get this starter after my girlfriend and her family introduced me to it. I received the product sooner than expected with a free upgrade from standard delivery to expedited mail. Not only did I get it much sooner than anticipated, but there was also an unexpected free gift included! Needless to say, I was very excited. Overall, I would highly recommend this product."
5,Harry potter trading card game by Edio,A brilliant game requires a bit of stratdgey work.Its best if you buy extra packs.
3,Thought it stood on its own,"From all the pictures, it appeared that this tote could stand up on its own. When rec'd, it was folded down so it won't. I wanted one that stood so I could easily flip through the papers. I got it for scrapbooking and only scrapbook out of my house. It would be great to travel with though. I really like the look of it. I'll just deal with holding it up and thumbing through pages or figure out something to set it in to hold it up."
3,Not quite big enough,"This tote is well-made, has a nice strap and dividers, and I love the colors. But it simply is not big enough. It's sized to hold 12x12 perfectly. Unfortunately, many of today's 12x12 papers are actually 12x12.5 or 12x13 because of the extra strip at the bottom that has the company name, design, color, etc. Those pages are too tall for this binder. I was afraid that the paper would become bent or crinkled. However, if you just want to store paper that is true 12x12, then this would be a great tote."
3,A bright Future,Terrible recorded CD...Poor Mic placement which makes the Bosendorfer sound OVER-BLOWN..The Bosey needs no close mic placement. He needs to mature but he will get there. A 4 for performance and a 1 for recording quality.OVERALL a 3.
4,"Small price, great mirror","When I started looking for a wall-mounted mirror, the price tags were huge. I thought this mirror might not be great, since the price was so reasonable. Turns out it's great quality, mounts easily, and is easy to use. I love it! (and my husband uses it too!)"
4,Works Well,"Product arrived in timely manner. Mounts to wall easily. Arm extends as described. 7X magnification is really large. Works well, looks nice in my bathroom. Would order again if needed another mirror."
5,Great Mirror,"This mirror does the job just like it should. This thing swings, tilts, and telescopes. It is a good size that mounts easily to a wall. Very classy design, with a great finish. I can see this thing lasting for many years to come. Even though it is not lighted, it has a brightness to it that gives plenty of light. Worth every penny."
4,Works well,"This works well and is clear with more than adequate extension on the scissors apparatus. Only minor complaint is that cannot keep the mirror tight against the extension arm, but have to finger tighten it on a regular basis."
4,Not very sturdy but does the trick,"It's easy to set up, works like it should, and easy to install. Good product, just a tiny bit flimsy but I don't mind it at all."
5,Mirror with class,"I just installed to wall and it is stunningly simple. The 7X is perfect and with no distortions.I recommend you take your time to afix to wall. The anchors made all the difference for a snug fit.I love the brushed nickle, that is what gives it quiet simple class. Well done!"
5,Nice. Versatile.,"The mirror is convenient, in that it can easily be moved aside when not needed. Yet, because it is mounted, it will never become ""lost"". The construction of this item is solid, giving the mirror assembly a sturdy feel. We are happy with it."
5,Handy Little Mirror,"I bought this mirror for my husbands bathroom for shaving, etc. We can't see as well as we used to so having the 7X mag will be very handy for both of us. It a durable mirror, as it's been up for 3 weeks and he hasn't broken it yet. If it can withstand him, it will hold up to anything. (He really can break an anvil-he's actually broken one before :))"
5,expandable mirror,I was happy to find this expandable mirror at at great price!!! on amazon.com and will be shopping there again. Looks great in the bathroom
2,murky mirror,"Wanting a better close-up bathroom viewer, I ordered this mirror. All was as described in the product description.....A handy add on for makeup. I found the mirror glass to be murky and had a ""grayish"" cast. My old mirror gave a brighter reflection. I returned it."
4,great mirror,Nice mirror. The high magnification is helpful for fine detail.The scissor effect works well.
4,Bigger than most,"This mirror is Bigger than most. I had 2 extension mirrors already, and this one is considerably bigger, and a higher magnification. If you just need to see for makeup, this is quite large enough, and maybe overkill, but I needed a mirror, and this was a good price. Quality is less than the other 2 I have (from different manufacturers), but it's fine. It works well on pulling out, and mounts easily, but it is heavy, and a snug pull, so do be sure you mount it on a stud if possible.Functionally, it's a great buy, but I gave it one less star because it is less pretty than others I've owned.Not ugly, just not as well finished."
4,jedon wall mirror,I've wanted this type of mirror for a long time.It's very versatile and works like a charm.Easy to install(if you can hang a picture OK)The fit and finish are very good for the price (it's not a hundred dollar product)and it's attractive in a utilitarian sorta way.Last but not least the shipping was quick and without drama.PS I would have given it five stars if it had been free.
1,very poor design,"This product is very poorly designed and poorly made. It does not function well. Motion too stiff. Mirror magnification too extreme. 5x or even 4x would be enough. With 7 times you must get too close to the mirror to make it useful. The mounting screws are wrong for the job. The philips head is easily stripped. Badly made, badly designed. Had I known I never would haver bought it."
4,Love It!,"I bought this product to replace a mirror that had unscrewed and fallen off my existing (retractable) wall mount. The mirror is large - which I like - with a 7x magnification on the flip side. My only criticism is that the accompanying wall mount is very heavy and bulky - mind you, it is made extremely well, and the finish is nickel, not aluminum or plastic. However, you'll need to drill into a solid wall in order to mount it. Instead, what I ended up doing was only removing the (long) screw pin (from my existing mount) and replacing it with the new one, then mounting the new mirror on top of that."
4,Jerdon 8-inch wall mount mirrow,"Good quality, however you have to tighten the mirrow to the support pole with some type of glue to make it hold tight."
4,Magnification too much,"In our last home, we had a similar mirror from Ikea that was 3x in magnification. We found this was not enough. When we moved, I ordered this 7x mirror. In construction, it is similar to the Ikea mirror.The reason I removed one star is because unlike the Ikea mirror, this one constantly unscrews - this is just from me pushing it back to shave while my wife pulls it forward to put on contacts and make-up. This was never an issue with the Ikea mirror. I finally had to use some Loctite Blue to prevent it unscrewing.I have not removed any stars but 7x is way too much magnification for shaving. I can only see one side of my face at a time and I have to close one eye to do that. The curvature of the mirror distorts the reflection too much. I would suggest a 5x mirror would be better."
5,Very nice quality mirror!,I really love this mirror. It is well made and classy looking. It was extremely easy to install. Great magnification. Wish I would have purchased it sooner!
3,Product ok,Product was average & as described. Fair price. Does the job but the scissor action is a little light weight & may not stand up to constant use..
3,I find that I'm always tightening the screws with every turn of the mirror,"I find this mirror very annoying to use. Every time I use the mirror I have to be sure to tighten the screws on the handle. The other day the mirror almost fell-off due to the screws coming loose. Also, the 7X magnification is not the best. I've used other mirrors with much better clarity. However, it is pretty nice looking. Just too bad that it is functionally flawed.-------------------------------Update to previous review: I used the loctite on the mirror, like another reviewer suggested. Now, the mirror is no longer coming loose. I would have given it more stars; if I hadn't had to go out and buy the loctite in order to make it work properly."
4,Must Have,I love this mirror...no more bending over the bathroom sink to see. I use this for putting on make up and to see the back of my hair when styling. I gave four stars because when you spin it around you have to make sure you don't loosen too much or it will come off other than that it's great.
4,Great little mirror,I'm near sided and needed a mirror that would come to me in the bathroom. This one does the trick. I use it everyday. If it were self cleaning it would be perfect - but - I don't think they've designed one of those yet!
4,Wonderful mirror,Did not include screws and wall anchors. Looked like box was already opened. I loved the mirror so I went out and bought the wall anchors instead of sending it back
5,Great mirror...,Ordered for my friend who had an older version of and her mirror had broke. She loves her new mirror. Sturdy and looks great.
3,Jerdon 8 inch Wall Mount Mirror 7X Magnification,"I would have purchased this particular item except it lacked one thing: IT WAS NOT LIGHTED. Therefore, I purchased another ""Jerdon"" wall mounted mirror - it cost almost double what this would have cost and it does not extend as much as this one, but I am happy with the one I purchased (still haven't received it yet)but what I reviewed about it, it is only second best to the the Jerdon 8"" Wall Mount Mirror 7X magnification nickel finish."
5,So far so good,"I just installed this program recently, and so far it has been perfect. Quick install, easy interface to use, it's not a memory hog like Norton and Mcafee. I am using it only for the Virus scan and firewall, and it eliminated on the first scan some spyware (trojan horses) that I couldn't get rid of previously with other antivirus and anti-spyware programs. I am running XP with a cable connection and the update system is flawless so far, and I would recommend this to any level of user, whether you're a novice or switching from another program. I read some online reviews as well as industry recommendations on this program, and they have been right on the money."
1,Note well -- only 1 bottle for price,"This product is receiving a poor review because it is not stated in the product description that the purchase is for only 1 bottle of finger paint (I received yellow - not by choice). The product description says ""nine brilliant colors"" so I thought I was getting all nine. I should have known from the price that nine bottles wouldn't be delivered, but I was optimistic and was actually amazed that the price could be so low. Alas, I was wrong. Be aware that this price is only for ONE bottle of unspecified color finger paint."
4,Live it up,"Great fun. But what else would you expect from LOS.This cd was dedicated to Mark Vann, Salmon's ultra talented banjo player who past away this year after a battle with cancer. His playing really makes the disc shine, which I beleive was the intention of the remaining members.The sound quality is above average,but at some points the mix is just a bit off.But every tune is as enjoyable as the next."
2,Let's get ready to...look for another boxing game,"The only real draw to this game is the fact that it's Mike Tyson. The graphics are average, the music barely tolerable, and the multiplayer mode somewhat lacking. The way the characters move was well done, but it's still not enough to warrant a purchase."
4,Well worth it for the price....,"First off, to answer the question of the previous reviewer; yes, this has all 3 episodes. It also has comentaries, both Japanese and English voice acting (and English subtitles of course), and an art gallery.Cyber City Odeo is not the best anime out there, but for roughly $10, it's more than worth it. During the time of it's initial release, this small series certainly stood out among the droves of cliché filled anime out there. The animation/art style is traditional mid 80's to early 90's, with the it's characters having more normal sized eyes, and the use of heavy blacks for shading being more prominent.The writing certainly has problems in areas (like the dialog having a bit too much clichéd swearing about every 5 seconds), and the image quality hasn't been enhanced at all fo the DVD (VHS quality, and no widescreen), but for all its faults, this is a great deal for an anime that certainly should be seen by any anime fan out there."
5,Engaging and action packed,"The 3 episodes don't let up on thrilling 90's cyber punk action from frame 1! This is a hidden gem that everyone is surprised by upon their first viewing, due especially to what I would describe as western graphic novel-like pacing and narrative than something most would consider Japanese. Can't beat the price, this disk is as featured as the most elaborate Akira tin (in all except packaging) with a plethora of language and subtitle features. It is well worth the >$5 it can readily be acquired for on Amazon."
3,Cyber City,"Is a decent anime, not great but not bad either, if you like futuristic films then you'll like it, has plenty of action too."
3,cyber city,interesting movie. didn't watch much. it has very nice graphics. impossible senario. boring mostly. i wasn't entertained in any way or form.
3,"Lack of depth, easily forgettable","Characters had no depth. The guy that crossdressed was kind of disturbing, and they never explained his transgender ways. Not much is ever really explained. Easy to watch, easy to forget. Seems like it could of went somewhere and never did."
4,"Big, dense, heavy, has a lot of unique insider perspectives","I wonder how many people ever read this book? Probably most copies sold sit on shelves and just look good. It was supposed to be the first in a series but it happens to be the only one ever made. I appreciated it for the number of writers that were included. Seldom will one find as many diverse opinions on the socially responsible investing (SRI) industry inside one cover. At this point there is nothing of value if you want ""new"" and ""up to date"" info. But from a historical perspective, it is a significant work. I suppose my only real criticism is that the editor gave it a ""positive"" tenor. The SRI movement has negative aspects too, but for some reason no such submissions made it into the finished work. I'd say it was too positive and could even be accused of being a marketing tool to talk-up things, generate their own excitement and hope it spills over to the public."
1,DID NOT WORK,Did not work on my Yamaha XT-350...Instructions state it is for a kick only Harley. Amazon description did not state what bikes it is for.
4,A great tool for the job hunter,"This is a great book by Tom Jackson. For many people who are unfocused about their future career opportunities, this book is a godsend. Mr. Jackson not only provides helpful information about the little things necessary to get a job, but he also includes exercises intended to get the reader thinking about what he/she really wants to do with their life. A great book that should be read by everyone prior to entering the job force."
2,A stinker,"This was a bargain purchase and now I know why it was priced so inexpensively...it's a stinker. I didn't think I could go wrong with Karajan and both the Vienna and Berlin Philharmonic Orchestras but this sounds horrible. It's a pity because it's really a beautiful combination of two of my favorite Tchaikovsky works but Romeo and Juliet was recorded in 1946 and Pathetique in 1939 and it sounds that way with lots of hiss, crackles and pops. Making matters worse the ending of Romeo and Juliet is abruptly clipped. I doubt whether I will ever listen to this CD again. I got what I paid for obviously."
4,"Great singer, limited choice of songs","If you want to find out why Dick Gaughan is a legend, this collection will give you half the answer. It features sad and lovely melodies that show off his voice, his inimitable timing and phrasing, his warmth, and his virtuoso guitar work. You'll probably love it. What it won't reveal is Dick Gaughan's lifetime devotion to working class politics and his hard-edged critique of power and class. What makes his work more than just lovely is the way he brings together present day politics and musical tradition to empower us all. Tracks on this CD weren't chosen by Dick Gaughan, but by the record company, and only from tracks they had rights to--which is how the whole ""Definitive Collection"" series is made. For a ""best of"" album created by the artist, and truly reflecting his career, choose the 2-CD collection ""Prentice Piece."""
3,fair,not that impressed with the selection of songs and was hoping to get more to increase my repetoir. too totally depressive
2,Duplicate and missing DVD in set,This set was purchased as a Christmas present. It was delivered in a very timely maner but when opened had two season one disk 3 DVDs and no disk 4 DVD. Season two was complete. This is a manufacturing packing fault with the product but spoiled the idea of purchasing a set. I don't believe the DVDs are available for sale separately. The exerience has left me cold on buying sets.
3,Advanced Technology,"Stargate Atlantis - The Complete Seasons 1 and 2I have been a serious fan of Stargate SG1 since the original movie and have collected all 10 season DVD's. For me this was THE quintessence of Sci-Fi genre on TV bar none. Due to circumstances beyond my control I was unable to see only a very few of the Altantis series and was not impessed with what I did see. So it was with a little trepidation that I purchased the first two seasons on DVD. From what I've seen so far Atantis is just a rehash of the same plot lines used in SG1 only with a new enemy, the Wraith instead of the Goa'uld. I'm sure if the production company et'al was someone completly different from SG1, there would be lawsuits flying over rampant plagiarism. I can only hope that the series starts to delve into its own original story lines that things will begin to gel into another series as good as the one and only SG1."
4,Good for work boots,"My husband wears these as his work boots in the kitchen, we had to add some insoles for more comfort but they are holding up well and he really likes them"
3,If you like the Jam and the Stranglers it's a bargain,"Although the last half of the record is a bit boring the first 5 songs on this CD would get 5 stars each. Buzztonic sound like a cross between the Stranglers and the Jam with a bit of their own sound creeping in. Arcade Babies is one of my favorite songs of all time.A lot of the songs have a 70's UK punk feel and that Dave Greenfield sounding keyboard is quite welcome to me. The singing sounds like a cross between Hugh Cromwell and Paul Weller, with the latter showing up more prominently. It's not a great CD but hey, for .14 cents (lowest price as of this rating) if you like the bands I mentioned, it will be a welcome addition to your collection."
3,Spur of the Moment -Spuraddict cd,"This cd is not as good as as the other two cd's--Spur of the Moment-Urban Renewal;Spur of the Moment- Out of the Shadows. ""spuraddict is o.k."" I wish the group had stayed together and made more of the ""Urban Renewal"" sound--It is Very Sophisticated and Smooth. PLZ get the two, that are recommened--YOU WILL NOT GO WRONG ON THESE. GREAT SONGS--GREAT SOUND. I just LOVE them."
1,Definately A Do Not Buy,I thought the last reviewer was being harsh and figured if I got one or two really good ideas this book would be worth the cost. NOT! It really is like a 10 year old's book report. It seems like it is several decades old and had no useful information at all. By the time I returned it I was out $$$. It appears to be a self-published book with very low quality printing and binding. On some pages the type was severely skewed. The one positive review on this book must be from the author or a relative. My suggestion:pass on this one.
1,What you would expect from a Used Car Dealership book,Looks like a book report my 10 year old son wrote for school. I could have done a better job on my home computer. Only gives the very basics. Not worth the 2 months it took to ship it or the paper it was typed on.
4,Read This Book,"Read this book. Read it to your children, and remind them to read it again as they get older. Tell your friends and lovers to read it too. This book can save our society if we remember that hard work and honesty are the best way to succeed in life."
1,Full of computer viruses,"I went to load it and my virus software alerted me it was full of viruses. I did not load it and got screwed paying for it. No one to talk to about it, and a complete waste of my money. First time ordering on Amazon that I got the shaft."
3,"Last Temptation, as viewed by a fan.","As of right now, there are 8 reviews for this item ahead of me. Very mixed reviews. With that being said, let us continue.Having been a Neil Gaiman fan for several years, being weened on The Sandman and Stardust, I had fairly high hopes for this graphic novel. Upon purchase, I sat down and read the dark tale in a matter of about 30 minutes. I was impressed by the fine artwork and twisted story, but overall I felt a little let down.Don't get me wrong, it's a great read, but if you're expecting Sandman caliber work in Last Temptation then you should just press the back button now. The story was rather predictable and, I felt, was rushed into a mere three parts, or ""acts,"" as they're called in this novel.Overall, a fun read and a must have for Gaiman fans, but don't expect too much."
2,Not the best work of Gaiman,"I am a HUGE fan of Neil Gaiman's work. I have been following his work since the early days of The Sandman. With that said, it is hard to be honest about this work. When it was first released I refused to give it a chance, due to the Alice Cooper tie-in. However, I recently decided not to be so close-minded and read this story for the first time. This story is a lackluster tale, full of allousions to the Alice Cooper album. The story itself is a Tales from the Crypt retelling of the ""Faust"" story. There is very little that is original or inspired. The effort to work in Cooper's lyrics holds back the plot and dialogue in more than a few places. The ending is horribly cryptic and vague. I would recommend this story only to diehard Gaiman fans."
4,Something Well Wicked This Way Comes,In a marketing event guarenteed to drive you nuts the first part of this 3 part series was initially given away free with the last temptaion CD.This however is the collection and tells the background story of the Alice Cooper Last Temptaion CD. The story is loosely based on Something Wicked this Way Comes (a fact acknowleged in the book (check out Stevens school book)The Story is competantly told as you'd expect from Niel Gaiman but the star hear is Zulli who makes Aices dark ringmaster look spectacular whilst keeping the air of shlock menace about him.If you like Alice Cooper or Neil Gaimans work this is a worthy addition to your collection.
5,...blue frogs,"this book was awful, just pure cheesy cheeseball stuffs thrown at ya. neil, i would've never expected this from you. zulli, your art is gorgeous as usual, but why this title? don't buy it, it's a waste of time and money. that's all i've got to say."
2,One Of Gaiman's Weaker Efforts,"I thought the story and the art were both very predictable. Themes familiar from the rest of Gaiman's work made only brief appearances. The art was too clearly a promotion for Alice Cooper. I enjoyed reading it, but it is nowhere near the calibre of _Sandman_."
2,Maybe if u are 20 something...,"This is presented as a beginners tape, not for me tho. I didsally of yoga with lillias when I was younger & am looking for something that gentle. It stretched everything and made me feel great. This tape just hurt me all over and not in a good way. Lilias's old VHS tapes need to be copied onto CDs for those of use who are disAbled enough to need gentle beginner. Very disappointed in this tape and several other newer ones."
2,a little advanced for this beginner,"I have Elena Brower's other DVD for beginners - and I liked it. This one seems a little jargon-y and wierd - telling us to breathe into our LEFT lung, and to feel the space between the hemispheres of our brains.Perhaps you should use it with the sound off - the poses are fine."
4,Liked Elena...good practice,"This was a good beginners yoga DVD.+ Elena does a nice of job of talking you through the poses. I would try another yoga video from her in the future.+ This is a good beginner level.+ Calming music and ambiance-AM yoga's difficulty level seemed higher than PM. Although I know that PM Yoga is more of a wind down, I would have liked for them to be more on the same level of difficulty."
3,*yawn*,"I love yoga and it is something I do a few times each week. I'm not a beginner by any means but I purchased this dvd in hopes of getting my morning off to a great start and relaxing at night. I figured it would be basic but oh my gosh, total snooze... I wouldn't even bother. check out Sara Ivanhoe's yoga dvds instead if you're just getting started."
4,Great for Beginners,I had the chance to just to the p.m. yoga and I like it. No annoying or pretentious breathing or speaking.
2,Not for beginners,AM and PM were basically the same. I was looking for a beginners yoga and did not think this was for beginners. There are many many moves I cannot do.
5,Perfect way to ease into and out of your day,"Even though this DVD is for beginners, I still do it all the time and find it extremely relaxing and awakening. Elena's voice and temperament are also my favorite among the Element series, very soothing. I do this DVD if I'm having trouble sleeping and try to incorporate into my morning at least twice a week, what a difference it makes. The poses ease you into your day comfortably and leave your body feeling awakened and activated all day. Highly recommend for all levels!!!!!"
2,Not For Me...,"My caveat: I'm not into the ""spiritual/meditative"" parts of yoga. True, that means I'm not a true yogi. I just like the exercise part of yoga.This DVD doesn't do it for me. I did the PM segment, and there was a whole lot of breathing and a little stretching. It was SO slow, that instead of feeling relaxed, I started feeling uptight that it wouldn't move on.For true yogis, this may be a great DVD. If you're like me, and you want a little more exercise and a little less meditation, I'd look elsewhere."
3,Good morning routines for beginners,"This, my first yoga video experience, has been a very satisfying one. The video is a little over 60 minutes long and is geared primarily for beginners like myself. There are two parts to it: a morning routine and an evening routine.I liked the morning routines as I am much more of a morning than an evening yoga-`person'. The morning routine teaches very basic poses of stretching, bending and exercising the muscles gently and in my opinion is a great experience.With the nightly routines, I felt a bit more stretched as the poses there exercise different body muscles.I like the sounds in this video, but could recommend more Theta-waved geared music for the nightly exercises."
5,"Ahhhh.... Awake, refreshed and de-stressed!","I can't say enough about how much I enjoy this DVD. I had tried a few yoga classes several years ago, but they did not inspire much. After my aunt described how beneficial yoga had been for her, I searched a number of DVDs and decided to try this one. It took me a few times to catch on to the poses. But now that I have, I rarely need to look at the screen because the instructor's verbal cues are sufficient.I truly believe my stress level has decreased as a result of this DVD. An added bonus is the toning I have witnessed in my arms, thanks to the planks and downward dogs.I should mention that I am an otherwise flexible person at a decent level of physical fitness. I think true beginners may have some difficulty with this DVD, but I would recommend taking it slowly, doing only what you are able, and following the modifications the instructor demonstrates. You know, common sense. :-)I only wish Elena Brower had an entire series of yoga DVDs."
3,Good for beginners,"Very basic and slow paced, just as expected from a beginners video. However, like many other exercise videos, it does not subtitle the yoga pose name , use and target area... which wold have been very helpful."
2,"AM Good, PM Mediocre!","The AM portion of this DVD was great, but the PM version was pretty blah. I understand that yoga is about breathing, but JUST breathing? I thought stretching was involved, too. I've used it once. I wouldn't recommend it."
5,My girlfriend went nuts for this!,"Innocent, sweet, wholesome small town girl....now a whip wielding, thigh high leather boot wearing dominatrix....!!!! Get your lady a copy!"
4,Great reading,"I was a bit doubtful when purchasing this book. But it turned out to be a well written, informative guide to Domestic Dominance.It's difficult to write a BDSM book that will be liked and praised by everyone. Kink is, after all, a very personal and intimate thing. However ""The Mistress Manual"" is a book I would recommend to every girl and woman who is fascinated by the subject and want to find out more about it.Unlike many books on the topic, ""The Mistress Manual"" does not focus on describing all the fantasies connected to Female Dominance. Nor does it claim to be the ultimate guide.However it's full of useful tips and advice, not to mention some of the technical aspects of BDSM.To the author I say: Great job!TO all the potential readers: This is worth your time."
3,Well written,This book is a step by step guide for dominating a woman. it's got personal insights from the author who has experience with this form of dominance. I found it refreshing.
2,Mysoginistic. . .,"Most of this book is tainted with this woman's petty revenge fantasies. She can't seem to seperate the idea of a well balanced BDSM relationship, founded on ideas such as trust and respect, from her indignacy at her perceived ""second class citizen"" status because she is a woman. I know several very self possessed dominant women in my circle who were aghast at the lack of respect represented in this book for the submissive partner."
2,Meh,"I wasn't entirely impressed with this book. I was looking more for advice on when to punish a submissive, scripts, stuff like that. Everything in the book is basic knowledge."
2,Early Intro to D/s,"If your lover has asked you to engage in BDSM or erotic roleplay and you've never really had an interest yourself OR you are the lover and you're looking for a little intro book to help out your would-be-domme, this book could be helpful for you. The author has put in considerable effort to explain the why's and how's of Dominance/submission - and tries to make it seem okay/""normal"" to someone who may be nervous or concerned about engaging in BDSM or erotic roleplay.However, if you have even the slightest dominant inclination, interest or experience, this book will be a waste of time and money. If you are already into BDSM and feel good about it, then you've already passed this book by."
5,A *perfect* guide for anyone new to BDSM,"This was a gentle, well-written guide to female dominance, but I think it's a great book for anyone interested in BDSM. Some books on the topic are hard-edged, but this author clearly has a deep respect for both the dom and the sub. If you have questions or curiosity about D/s at all, this is a great place to start."
3,Not what I was really hoping for.,"I only chose this rating because I was looking for something else. I am still in search of the perfect Domme book. That being said I'm not sure what I was looking for, but I didn't find it in this book. This was for sure something to read if you have ZERO experience in the scene at all. If you are completely lost and haven't even looked anything up online about the subject, you will enjoy this book. The only part I found helpful was coordinating which styles fit which type of Domme. I am however, glad I read the entire book. Overall it did open my eyes to a few things I had never considered before reading this. It is well written and is almost a step-by-step guide and how-to."
3,definitely worth the money,"i bought this because i was bored...what a good thing...i spend hours on it...ive been djing trance for years but never got into production...obviously, this isnt any subsitute for a real studio, but before i buy all the hardware, i figured id use this thing to understand the basics of trance progression...before i blew the cash...more than anything, it fills the time and introduces you to the art...the instructions are terrible though...i admit, theres no way to cram a real instruction manual into the packaging, but a free download somewhere would be nice...they tell you to look on the internet for furthur instructions, but dont tell you where...geez...its like, here you go, hope you werent serious...if you guys find one somewhere, post it cause id love to have it...anyone tried sample editing yet?...good luck, its not that hard...but basically your on your own, because the manual is, once again, terrible...also, why do people refer to this as a game?...go figure..."
4,An excellent Mix!,"MTV Music Generator is like the ""Easy Bake"" of Dj's. It allows you to blend and mix riffs with ease and to your liking. You can cut samples from your regular cd's and paste it on your song as well. Although, it's a shame that you can't synthesize a guitar since that would be a great innovation to the game. Also, making your own video is quite fun as well. All in all, it's a great game that should take notice from fans who don't want to spend 2000$+ on DJ equipment."
4,MTV Music Generator,"It was a little tough at first to get your sample from an audio CD and actually getting it into your own mix, but after you go over the first few bumps you should be on your way. I also noticed that there really is thousands or riffs and thousand more samples you could make. The only thing that plagued this game in my opinion is that you can have long, complex songs just starting out. You have to pretty much have to know the specific riff or note or sample you want in your song because of the SRAM issue. But, I'm sure when PSX2 comes out in the fall of 2000 space won't be a problem and this game should be a must for any music fanatic or just a fun little tool. Other than that the jam session is fun but again you need to know the specifics you need. So, even if I knew about these problems I would still buy this excellent game..."
5,thisis hot,"this is the most unique game out. i have made some cds with this. i have made artist mixes by using the samples. it is great . it has plenty o beats , melodies etc. two flaws: the memory fills up real quick , especially with samples and there are 2 many tecno type beats which isnt bad if u dig it, but other than that u cant find a more creative game."
4,good music creation,"I thought that MTV Music Generator was a good product. The part where you can record from your own cd is good but when I use the sample in my own riff, it always speeds it up so fast that you can't even understand it. The movie creation is an exciting feature. It would be nice though if you could create a movie to go along with your audio cd while you play it."
2,Funny as mud and not what was pictured!,"I received the book promptly. However, I am displeased that the cover shown is not the cover on my book. Instead of the laughable couple going over the falls at the Tunnel of Love, I received a cover depicting something like TROLLS in canoes. Funny as mud.The paper quality is good, and the cartoons inside are okay, too. I do like the elastic band feature. Not sure if I want to keep this book or not!!I have written to Amazon with my complaint and am awaiting a return response!! I usually have excellent service with them, so being unhappy with the product is new to me."
5,Read This Review,"I gave this CD 5 stars because there is NO way that this guy is serious. It HAS to be a joke he's playing on everyone. If that's the case, then I get the joke and it's funny as hell. If he's serious, then you can use this CD to make unruly house guests leave with a quickness. [...]"
1,One born every minute,"Whilst looking for the song Laurie by Alessi, one of my all time favourites, I stumbled upon this album. Ignoring one rather caustic critique, I absorbed the positive comments made by the other reviewers, to the man waxing lyrical about Tom Arico's unique style.I took the plunge and ordered and I have to say that I have to agree that in his field, Tom has few peers. He has taken the rulebook and tossed it out of the window. Who was it who said that you could need to at least be moderately talented in the singing department to knock out an album? Musically, my renderings on the kazoo are all that I can think of that might be compared unfavourably to this album. Self-confidence is something that Mr Arico cannot be short of although I doubt whether the queues to his concerts stretch around too many blocks.A fool and his money are easily parted and on this occasion the fool is me. No hold on Tom - that's not an idea for a lyric.....please!"
1,Why can't I give ZERO stars?,"Words cannot even begin to describe the depths Tom Arico sinks to in this ""new"" stain of an album. Of the nine songs on the album, only three are even from this decade! From the misspelled words in the liner notes to the whiny, thin, pathetic attempts at vocal stylings, this album is bad from start to finish."
1,Buy the 2006,"I think it's disgusting the lack of research Yale Daily News put into this 2007 guide. There are a hundred things wrong with this guide, but just from opening to the school I go to (University of Delaware), and seeing that one of the things I have to do before I graduate is ""go to the Stone Balloon,"" I could tell this book was just a new cover to the 2006 with updated admissions statistics. The Stone Balloon, a historic University of Delaware Bar and Music Hall, announced more than a year ago that it was going to be knocked down and replaced by condiminiums on Main Street. This was true, and it was closed for the spring, and camera crews were there at the beginning of the summer to see huge bulldozers knock it over. Pretty sad that NO ONE will be able to fulfill the Insider's Guide's instructions. Sweet life Yale...do some research and stop making money reprinting the same ""best-selling"" book each year"
1,It's Three Mystery's in one,Wonderful mystery book for the young investigator you have to keep your eyes open the whole story. Solve why the cave of Moaning Valley moans. Solve who the Old One is and who stold the Diamonds!
2,A Visual Journey without Much Substance,"Beautiful pictures, arty design, but not much of substance in this book. Its really more of a pictorial history. This book gives very little insight into modern Hindi films. Living in India, and watching a number of Hindi films, I find they are a window into Indian mindset and worldview. And if you suspend your irony, some moments of silly fun. Too bad this book doesn't unlock more of the secrets of Bollywood."
2,"Good, if you already know the material","There were a couple pages of the basics, but then completely switched gears (like an editor decided to cut a couple chapters). Just once, I'd like to pick up a math text that delivers the basics up-to and including the point of the book. This ""engineer-level"" book requires prior knowledge and didn't work for me as a self-teach/refresher."
3,Only flaw I found was the sound quality,"Khachaturian's Gayne Ballet (in its 1942 original version, not the 1962 revised version) is wonderful and fulfilling. The selections from ""Spartacus"" are a pleasurable feast for the ears, and the Masquerade & Russian Fantasy are flawless through the baton of Loris Tjeknavorian. The tempi are precise, the orchestral emotion is outstanding, and the sound quality is awfully unsatisfactory. I mean, seriously, the BMF transfer is weakly done. Half of the tracks are frail in volume, and the bass sound is heard incorrectly. All in all, if you want a complete version of Khachaturian's Gayne and the Masquerade suite, then this is the 2-CD set for you. Otherwise, you better find a more recommendable recording...if there are still any out there."
4,"Worth It, Sonic Warts and All","Portions of Khachurian's Gayne and Spartacus music were used to great effect in the Coen Brothers' film The Hudsucker Proxy. Here you get a complete performance of the former, along with selections from Spartacus, the Masquerade Suite and Russian Fantasy, all on two discs. I agree that the sonics are less than optimal, but I also in my layman's way think that those problems are not as horrendous as others suggest. And the music for Gayne -- all 100 minutes of it -- is by turns engaging and lush. Loris Tjeknoavorian and the National Philharmonic Orchestra do fine by the full score, and the conductor teams up with the London Symphony in the other three works in great style as well. For an opportunity to hear Gayne complete (as far as I know), this set is definitely worth it, misgivings about the sound or not."
1,Worst Khachaturian: Gayne CD,"I bought this 2-CD set just for the first CD ""Gayne"", which is my favorite ballet for Khachaturian. Some times it is called ""Gayne"" or ""Gayane"" or ""Gayaneh"" I'm not sure why, but it is pronounced actually as ""Gina"". I was really disappointed when I listened to the first CD, especially ""Lullaby"" - it was really awful. Also, they claim it is a ""Complete Ballet"" and the best pieces of the Gayne ballet are missing! The only 2-CD set that I know of that has the complete Gayane ballet is ""Aram Khachaturian: Gayane - A Ballet in 3 Acts"". But you have pay way much more to acquire a new or even used one. But It is totally worth it if you really love the music of the ""Gayane"" ballet - which is an amazing masterpiece!"
4,At home among strangers,I think this book does a great job of summarizing subjects that I have read entire books on before. There is a lot of information packed into this book. It gives you a great perspective on the Deaf community in Amercia.
2,Dry Box Revuew,"I purchased this for my Pontoon boat. The Orange MTM Sportsmen's Dry Box is labled as coming with an O-Ring Seal. I believe they proper terminology for this so called O-Ring is, wanna be O-Ring gasket and proper marketing product name should be:""Orange MTM Sportmen's Water resistant box with gasket"". There is nothing dry about this box. I would only use it to store things you prefer not to get wet. This would be great as far as keeping utensils, paper products, and binoculars out of the elements. The case itself is very flimsy.I would not put my wallet, phone, keys, or anything of value in this box. Pay close attention to the boxes labeled with O-rings.I would recommend getting the Underwater Kinetics Dry box. Here is the Amazon link for them:""http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords;=underwater+kinetics+dry+box"""
4,Gibson 9517 Super Truck Exhaust System Review,This is much better than i expeceted. Very low rumble when idoling and great roar when you stomp on it. I wish it was just a little louder at full throttle though. I read the greater than 95 dB when towing warning at thought it would be a little louder. You can hardly hear it on the highway at cruising speeds which is nice. Very easy for the muffler shop to install. only took 20 minutes or so. The exhaust tips look great!
3,Not Sure About This One.,"I love most of the Seth books, and this one was not too bad, its a shame tho, alot of it, just seemed to be repeated over and over again, till you kinda lose interest. Of course its interesting and has alot of good points, but takes a turn with the constant repeating of the same thing. If your an avid Seth reader, then its okay, but you may be lost if your not."
5,Insightful,"I absolutely adore the Seth Material in general b/c it has caused me to really connect with and to myself, as well as made me more aware of my fellow man and how important we all are."
3,"Comprehensive, but...","This is an interesting concept. I'm a big drama fan, and I never thought there'd be an English language book about them. I like how detailed and comprehensive this book was. The main gripe I have is that series are listed under the English translations of their titles. You can look up the original Japanese title (in romaji) in the index, but it's an extra step you shouldn't have to take, especially since translations of the titles can be inconsistent. I rarely see series listed by their English translations online too."
2,Story is a bit humdrum,"I like Deborah Camp's books, but this one is lacking a bit. I know what a good story she can write, but this one lacks creativity in the story line, and I keep finding myself losing interest in the characters and their romantic thoughts and interludes. It's a bit too predictable for me."
4,Great Reading,"I really enjoyed the writing style and interesting, believable story line. I will definitely look for more of her books."
5,I Love to play this game,If you are a Star Trek fan and love to play video games this is one game you should not go without. It has a great story plot and is fun to play.
5,Great,"I admit ive never heard of this guy before but i picked it up due to the reviews and i really was great. The mixing is top class and the beats/grooves are great. Anyone into GU will appreciate this CD. Cmon people its like wat, 8 dollars used for 2 cds, its worth every penny."
1,this cd ...,"I bought this cd because ""Superstreet"" rated it so well in their magazine. The beats are continous and boring. If he had any skillz he should have used them for more uptempo beats. But everyone who rated this seemed to like it so at least he has some fans outthere. My recommendation don't buy it unless you like slow boring not even close to melodic beats how one could even dance to this is an enigma to me. In other words i'll never buy another cd with chris fortier's name on it ever again."
2,This camera has some serious problems.,"I have experienced the dreaded ""flashing H"" problem about 7 times (based on my usage of this camera this translate into a dissapointing 15% failure rate!!). What happens is that after inserting new film it goes to the unwind phase and then the H flashes on the LED display. I have been able to fix the problem a couple of time by fiddling with the battery (shoving it in and out a couple of times). Otherwise the whole role of film is wasted. This is a very serious problem. The camera failed on several occasions where I really need to get pictures. Ever since this happened, I always carry back up disposable camera. This shouldnt be necessary when you buy a camera (Its really a big joke!)"
3,"Great Size, But Totally Unreliable","Yes, the dreaded ""H"" problem. Happens so often and ruins enough film, you want to throw it out the window. Great size, great zoom, but an unwelcome adventure everytime you need to reload film. Clearly a design flaw that really frustrates."
5,Big Things Come In Small Packages,"This little camera can fight right in your packert, so take it anywhere. It also takes great pictures. It has a lens adjuster and a camera case that it fits in perfectly. I would defenitly reccommend it."
1,"""Within Specs"" and inoperable","I loved the camera. Great pictures, great size. Then it stopped working. I sent it back to Canon Service in Irvine. They reported the camera ""within factory specs."" It still doesn't work right. They don't care. I have other Canon cameras. They are excellent."
1,FAILURE,"I READ THE BOOK IN SPANISH AND ALTHOUGH IT'S A GOOD TRY INTO FANTASTIC GENRE, THE BOOK DOESN'T WORK AT ALL. IT'S TOO PRETENCIOUS. THE CHARACTERS ARE STEREOTYPES, NOT TO SPEAK OF THE AMPHIBIOUS PEOPLE, REALLY LAUGHABLE.READ THE STORIES OF EDGAR ALLAN POE OR MAUPASSANT INSTEAD. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME IN THIS CRAP"
4,Kind of existential,"I found this book almost impossible to put down once I started reading it. Right from the start, I was struck by the brooding tone of the novel. There are definitely some Lovecraftian elements to the novel (desolate locale, post-WWI time setting, monster elements), with a smattering of Hemingway thrown in for good measure (obscure references to a traumatic past). However, I think that the author explores the psychological elements of human conflict and isolation to a greater extent than Lovecraft ever did. The existential bits come in at the end of the novel, which, though satisfying in an ""Aha!"" kind of way, left me trying to puzzle out the meaning of it all. Are they in hell? Are they in limbo? What the heck does it all mean?"
5,Hate horror but loved this!,"What I love about this book is on the surface it seems like a monster book but it is really so much more and in the end not even really about the monsters at all. I recomend this book to anyone. My favorite thing about it is that it gets right to it, no messing around!"
1,Not what I thought it was,I thought this was the same as the spray on wipe off formula. This is a thick blue chalky formula that is VERY hard to get off. Will not buy again as there are better products available.
1,Useless,"I bought this because it can be used on ANY stove to clean and polish it. So I tried it on my brand new Black range (not the flat cook top type, regular electric range) and all it does is streak and put a haze on the black. Had to use ammonia to get it off and to get my stove shiny again. Waste of money."
3,Didn't Match My Expectations,"I bought this for my gas stove top at the local hardware store. Followed the instructions to the letter and it didn't work that well in regard to getting of burned on grease. I had to apply several times, allow the product to penetrate, and then scrub away. Eventually, I ended up buying another product off the Internet which completely removed the stain with minimal effort.I also used this to clean a induction cooktop and it performed much better doing a thorough job and leaving no streaks or residual build-up.Just my observation, but this is probably a good product for glass cooktops. I wouldn't advise using it on gas cooktops. It doesn't seem to have the grease cutting power needed to tackle difficult messes."
1,What a waste of time and money,"Researched the inter net for info on how to clean a gas cook top. This product was highly recommned. I tried it and the results are absolutely horrible. Didn't clean as promised, didn't clean at all. Don't waste you money."
1,Do not buy!,I have a glass cooktop. Used Easyoff oven cleaners before and left on for a few hours. That worked for getting the tough burnt on splatters on the ring of the burner.Target did not have the oven cleaner so bought this cooktop cleaner....Mistake! Followed directions to the 'T' and did not remove anything! Disappointed!
1,In a word: Useless,"Don't waste your money on this completely ineffective product. I bought this spray bottle of glass cooktop cleaner thinking that it would be an easy way to maintain the look of my stove top. After using it several times according to the manufacturer's directions, I am completely disgusted. It doesn't remove anything, even after letting it sit on the stains for over an hour. The product instructions direct you to remove any cooked-on stains with a scraping blade prior to using it. Once you've done that, there is no need to use this cleaner at all - plain water would be just as effective. I now use Cerama Bryte with a damp Magic Eraser on my cooktop, and it works beautifully. I feel like sending this product back to Reckitt Benckiser and demanding a refund!"
1,Not worth the money.,"Easy-Off Glass Top Cleaner was very disappointing. Considering it cost over $7.50 in our local grocery store for only 8.5 oz, I was expecting at least better than average effectiveness. Unfortunately all it did was shine the glass a little. All Purpose Windex did a much better job at a much lower price."
1,Useless product,"I bought this for cleaning my cooktop, but besides a pleasant smell of the product, it does nothing just water would not do. It is no help in getting any spills off."
5,are we all using the same thing?,Is everyone commenting on the same thing? No range of in between stars only 1's and 5's. This is a cooktop review... have to wonder what we are all talking about.Mine is easy off cooktop cleaner ... works great.
1,A Smear Job,"My wife used this product one time and declared that she hated it and would neve use it again. I had to try it for myself to see if she was exaggering. She wasn't.I sprayed it on a cooktop after making some crabcakes with the resulting splattering of oil. I sprayed on the product as directed. It comes out in a streamy glob, not a nice symmetrical spray, so it's hard to control.Next I wiped with a wet sponge as directed,followed by a wipe with a dry towel. The results were catastrophic. Our cooktop had never looked worse, covered with smears and blotches.Luckily we had our old standby, Weiman CookTop Cleaner, in the wings. A few swipes of the Weiman and the cooktop looked great.Our almost full container of Easy-Off is going in the trashcan where it belongs."
5,Jackie Cooper was so loveable ;-),"Jackie Cooper had a great personality & sense of humor. I only remembered him from The Little Rascals. I'd heard of The People's Choice with the talking dog, but never got to see it until it became available through this offering.I have to say I was highly entertained & found Jackie Cooper enchanting & very pleasant to watch. Cleo who is almost as adorable comes a close second. I never knew Mr. Cooper had done a series as an adult where he was a weekly performer. He handled the part beautifully.I only wish MORE of this series were available.If this were to ever get released as full season sets, I'd buy them up as I'm sure many others would.Perhaps we can make inquiries to Alpha Video regarding future installments?"
1,DON'T BUY,"Product doesn't protect near what it is rated to. Yes I followed the directions, but now I have permanent ear damage (bad Tinnitus) due to trusting this earplug at an outdoor firing range. Everyone else using various other earplugs were fine. Do yourself a favor and use Hearos or Howard Leight brand and don't make the same mistake I did."
2,A Boring Disappointment,"It is my practice not to buy a DVD, CD or Blu-Ray until I have read the reviews, My fellow shoppers have demonstrated more artistic erudition than I claim to possess. Unless I really, really know the artistes and their Organizations, I rely on the consensus created by my fellows to make my decision. In this case I relied only on the fact that Werner Herzog was the guiding artistic force behind the production. I was disappointed. The entire production was static. The staging sparse to empty; the ""crowd scenes"" devoid of people;, Lohenggin's Lieber Schwann, a mechanical joke. About the only dramatic action was between Elsa and Ortrud in a name calling scene. I've learned my lesson: Pay heed to my fellow Amazonians.: Read their reviews before I put money on the barrel head, 8 out of 10 times I'll agree with the majority call. Hey! fellow reviewers, Aint we all so clever and discerning, that the poor plebians can rely upon our views? King Arthur, Arthur Stanley Katz, May 18, 2011"
3,Great Titles w/1 drawback,"I bought this camera in Asia and it's one of the best sellers there this summer! The feature that I love the most is the ability to select different captions other then the standard date/time for your photos. They have quotes such as i love you, thank you and happy birthday, etc. It just makes some memories more special! Rollei is a well respected brand name as well. The only drawback is the non covered lens. Other then that, this camera is a great deal for the many functions (ie. multiple exposure) that it provides for the price."
5,what a deal!!,This shoe is perhaps the best pump I've purchased in a long time. The quality is fantastic. Unisa makes a great product and Amazon provided a fantastic price... what more can I say.
5,Great grinder!!,"I am the sort of person who is very meticulous, and I would rather have one well made tool than a dozen cheap ones. Having said this I must say that I am thoroughly impressed and pleased with the DW824 grinder. It has good balance, A LOT of power, and is made to last. I especially like the quick-adjust guard, this makes it really convenient to use when grinding at different positions. The extra long cord all but eliminates the need for an extension cord, and the power in this small package is awesome!! I have yet to bog the motor down!! I looked high & low at all other grinders of this size (4 1/2"" & 5"") and I feel that this one beats the others hands down. I would heartily recommend this grinder to anyone."
1,Remarkably short and not terribly informative.,"This video is only 10 minutes long and NOT worth $15. I was very disappointed. The video goes on for about 3-4 minutes before it even shows Stonehenge. Very light on the facts or speculations about Stonehenge and the narrator's silence is filled with cheap music. If you are looking for a quality documentary about Stonehenge, look elsewhere. Such a disappointment."
3,Strictly Functional,"Store your current seat and lid, because it isn't used with this product. It is a functional useful product, but really makes the bathroom look institutional looking. If you want function not form, this product does fine."
1,rip-off,"The same company has a ""toilet seat riser"" that is supposed to raise the seat 4 inches--but it collapses down to about an inch when you sit on it. Filled with flimsy soft foam. Completely worthless!"
3,Ok could be better,The clamp to hold things is place is worthless.Not a very percise tool but using a stop block you can get more accurate cuts.Is a handy little tool to have though.
1,"Toy Like Product. Grizzly, NOT!!","This product is very poorly designed especially the supposed piece holder which is a joke & potentially dangerous. Someone posted that the base was cast iron, it's not, it's very light gauge steel. Actually I sent it back because I found it an accident in the making. When I complained to the company about the product, they were a bit resistant to accepting it back & I had to pay $10.00 shipping to return it. I just felt that using it on a tool that was spinning @ 11K RPM's wasn't a good idea. On the plus side, the arm seemed to be fairly stable but after opening the box & looking at it's construction, I just put it back & started the return process. Another thing is, they ship it without any washers that are most essential if you were to try to use it because I'm sure the vibration would cause the bolts to loosen & cause more problems or injury."
2,I'd pass on this - not a quality item,I rarely use this because of it's rickety feel. Moved on to better (more expensive) tools. Pass unless you have little need and just want to save a few $$.
5,This Album Changed My Life,"This album totally changed the way I looked at hip hop when it came out in 1996. It was mad hard to find here in Massachusetts, but once I found it, I was completely blown away. It is a mind bending experience to be a 16 year old white kid listening to this album on Cape Cod for the first time. I was the only kid in my entire high school who had it, and I let the real intelligent kids enjoy it with me, now it is a hip hop classic. The weird thing that struck me about it at the time was that hip hop kids didn't like it. It was way too far ahead of them. This is one of the greatest albums EVER recorded, in any kind of music."
5,Simply Amazing,"When Dan The Automator, Q-Bert, and Kool Keith got together, they could do no wrong. Dr. Octagonycologyst is one of the oddest, funkiest, and best hip-hop albums of all-time. Kool Keith was simply on some other planet when it came to his insane lyrics and twisted concepts. His portrayal of the crazy doctor fits the album perfectly; I can't see anybody else doing it like Keith did. Dan The Automator's production is superb especially the creepy ""Girl Let Me Touch You"", the fantastic ""Blue Flowers"", and the electro-funk jam ""Earth People"". And Q-Bert destroys the turntables on ""Bear Witness"" and many of the albums tracks. If you do not have this, get it now. You will probably not find an album this original anywhere."
2,"...disturbing, and a waste of talent","What were they thinking when they made this album? the beats are hip and funky, and i can enjoy it until they come in with dirty lyrics that make me want to jump in the shower and scrub away the filth......avoid it."
1,I Don't Get It,"I mean what the fudge is this, you call this spit hip hop.... I wasted my dollars. I am not feelin or have any comprehension for this style of dark, fake Dr. Funkinstein or whatever. I tried to have an open mind and listened a second time but I could not find a song title, track, beat, rhyme, flow or concept that I could get with and I am an openminded individual, trust."
4,Crazy but cool with a really good beat,"As a clinical psychologist, i say Dr. Octagon is certifiably crazy. This said, the CD is one of the best I have heard in my 23 years as a praciticing psychologist. Listen and enjoy."
5,Here's some bread!,"Simply the most deliously bizarre and brilliant cd I have ever heard. From fantastic production from Dan the Automator to Kool Keith's hystical lyrics and delivery, this will not disappoint (unless you're Keith, as he reportedly dislikes this album due to the fact that a lot of 'white people' like it - but maybe he was just ranting, one can never tell with him).Kool Keith's other works like Dr. Dooom and Sex Styles are fine, but follow-ups Black Elvis, Matthew, Spankmaster pale in comparison mostly due to the bland music.If Keith should collaborate with Dan the Automator again, I'll be there!"
4,"Great sound, poor lyrics","After hearing the instrumentalist version of Dr. Octagon, I blindly decided to by this album. I did enjoy it; it provides quirky beats along with interesting/strange skits. However, alot of the lyrics don't rhyme, which is one thing I do like when it comes to rap. The lyrics are essentially incomprehensible. Yes, it's English all right, but nothing he seems to say makes any sense, as there is no real, general theme to follow. I would definitely recommend this album to people who are looking for something different. Not traditional rap, rather a science fiction movie style hip hop CD."
3,ok,"Upon its original release, it's easy to see why ""Dr.Octagonecologyst"" might have been lauded as a masterpiece. Years later, though, it seems a bit messy and undisciplined, and the freestyling, hallucinogenic lyrics come across as sloppy and at best quirky rather than charming and innovative. Against new sci fi rap groups like Deltron 3030 or experimentals like Prefuse73, this album just doesn't hold up. At best, it's a precursor to later concept'sci fi rap albums of today, and it's evident that all of the current crop owe a debt to this album's boundary-crossing aproach. But Kool Keith himself has admitted in interviews that this album took very little time and effort, which is why I think this album offers very little beyond its own novelty and its influence on later groups."
5,the best raper ever,this is the best album i have and i'm not a real big rap fan but this album cought my attention wen iheard it i had to by it and i am a death meatal fan but doc.oc and deltron and 80's rapers are realy the only rapers i like and i realy recomend for people how want somthing difrent and if open minded anuf and like meatal check out this album it is varey difrent and thats it
2,The doctor is dim,"2 1/2Overpraised as a staple of underground hip hop, Keith's delivery of science-sexy nonsense can be entertaining but grew stale along with the 90's beats."
3,parts missing,"The seller sent the CD as soon as was stated, and I received it in fine condition, with limited scratches as stated. The only thing I was a little disappointed about was it had been stated that I would receive the CD cover slip, although not in good condition. I did not receive the CD coverslip, it actually came in a thin case that usually holds burned CDs. The CD was not burned though, and it plays fine."
5,The doctor has dissected..,"Every track is a headnodder. Highly recommended for all real hip hop heads. QBert spices up some of the tracks, too! FRESHHHHH."
5,"Raunchy, tasteless, and funky as all get out!","Could be offensive to those who want to be offended, but the flow is checked and the vibe is right with Dr. Octagon. Coarse lyrics over slow/smooth beats, porno samples mixed with classical music, and an answering machine message for a doctor who can fix just about everything. Lyrical content aside, the production is flawless, the samples are perfectly chosen and arranged, and you can't help but nod your head to the nasty voice coming correct on tracks like ""Blue Flowers"" and ""Earth People."" And don't forget to hang on after the last track to hear the unforgetable Mr. Gerbik who is apparently ""half shark/allegator, half man."" It's a gem for the hip-hop community."
3,"Great beats, rhythm, but those lyrics!","Excellent rating on the variety of sounds; good transitions and levels, but the nastiness of the lyrics ( and repetition) gets in the way of everything that's awesome about this CD.Nastiness is fine, but how about some more subtle means of conveyance, a bit more creativity, instead of such 3rd grade level of communication about rectal regions and surgical stabbings??So I've said what I deem necessary--the beats and rhythm are the finest aspects of this--but just when you think you've been taken to another plane of existence, those idiotic lyrics kick in and down you go to the level of ...???HUH????"
4,different breed,Kool Kieth is like no other. you really have to give it a chance if your not feelin his albums at first. it seems to me the more i listen to them the more i like them. i also agree sometimes his repititve chorus get annoying but most of the time i end up singing them in my head. personally i think Dr. Doom anf Black Elvis are both better then this album. My favorite is Kut Master Kurt: Masters of Illusion
5,What Hip-Hop really needed...,"I have always been a big Ultra fan, but it took me a long time to find this album because I kept looking under ""Kool Keith"" in the record store.Anyway, it's about time there are some artists who are not afraid to take risks and be original, not sound like everyone else, do duets with the ""rapper of the month"" etc.Keith will definitely lose you lyrically on most of this ride, but it's enjoyable.I will not go as far as to say this is one of the best rap albums ever, but I will say Kool Keith is one of the best rap lyricists AND artists of all time. (There are many good rappers, but some of them have no artistic sense...)"
4,Perfection. Five star masterpiece,"This is a wacky CD.....I don't know what to say but it has this funky old horror/sci-fi feel to it that ive never heard before in my life. you really have to sit down and listen to this 3-4 times to feel his style but once you feel it its tight. try smoking a spliff and then listen that helps but this cd is tight. Dj Q-Bert is ssoo ... amazing on this. He rips it up on a ... cut, it sounds so dope. THis is a must have."
5,Dr. Octo.,"Turn your head and cough, because the doc is in.Your check up will start with the initial drops of LSD25.You are left writhing on the table as the doc leaves you to explore your ego (the sense of I)and oblitorate it.Every visit is filled with laughing crying,and the desire asume the fietal position."
3,Mixed Success,"Many people believe this album is totally solid and consistent. Not I. There are about five songs, I think, that are really good. ""Blue Flowers Revisited"" it absolutely great and original. ""Bear Witness"" rocks. But the porno-skits get really tiresome. Many of the tracks are too long and of only mild interest. Plus the album itself doesn't have enough good ideas to sustain its long length. However, many of the ok songs do have redeemingly wierd lyrics. How can you dislike a guy who puts a song on his album called ""halfsharkaligatorhalfman""?"
5,Best gift for golfers!,"This is the one gift that golfers love the most. They get a golf tip from a professional, every day of the year. All my friends love it and you will see it on every golferss desks during the year. It makes a great stocking stuffer as well! It is a national best seller every year. I love it."
5,Serenity,"Midnite and ""unpolished"" bring a pureness that is so rarely found in modern day. A serene essence will pour out of this album when you first listen to it, as does many of their others. Live, they leave you with the same feeling. Their music is a true inspiration to the music world. I highly recommend all their albums, especially this one, which demonstrates their extremely intelligent lyrics and original, hypnotic roots. A MUST have."
3,RUNS SMALL,"GOT THIS IN A SMALL, WHICH IS MY USUAL SIZE (5'3"" AND 110 LBS), AND IT'S TOO SMALL. I CAN GET IT ON, BUT IT'S NOT COMFORTABLE, DESPITE THE FORGIVING FABRIC. MY DAUGHTER WILL INHERIT THIS. SHE'S TINY. I ALSO THINK IT'S KIND OF OVERPRICED, THOUGH I LOVE THE MODAL FABRIC."
3,WELLLLLL! DIFFICULT TO DESCRIBE -,"I dislike it when a book leaves me dissatisfied.The story is very well writtenThe character growth is excellent. The characters really believable personalities.Just too much looseness of moral character for the principles - Hank and Emily, especially as Hank has a daughter to influence.Too geared to self-gratification and not enough grit to the story. Ah well, you can't win them all.A good read for the ""Cowboy Country"" subtitle - you have to decide for yourself -- my disappointment in the characters maybe exciting to you.Even Hank's rescue of Em was a result of their decisions.I will try again in the fourth episode ""The Forever Night"" with Andy and Ginny."
1,Worst glasses ever purchases,"These glasses are not worth it. I have only had them since July and just about 2/3's are broken or cracked and had to be thrown out. Not to mention, the base is supposed to prevent it from tipping. It does exactly the opposite. I would not recommend this product."
2,Breaks Too Easily,They are nice but they are way to heavy on the bottom and they break to easily. If you NO NOT have a dishwasher DO NOT buy these they break constantly and very easily.
2,Libbey Polaris Drinking Glasses,"I actually love the glasses and would give a 5 star if half of them didn't arrive broken, the packing was extremely poor and I will not purchase glasses again via Amazon, if they were available at one of the retail stores I would buy them in a second for they are very nice."
1,What Idiot Packed This Item....?,"Who ships a glass item Mother's Day present without foam peanuts or bubble wrap?Who ships glass items without a sticker labeling it as ""FRAGILE"", ""BREAKABLE"", ""GLASS"", ""HANDLE WITH CARE""... or any such warning?I've received hard back novels that were better packaged - the packaging for a set of tumbler glasses was more suited to a cinderblock..HORRIBLE...."
2,low quality and looks cheap,I don't recommend this product. The quality is poor and you could even see bubbles in the glass. They looks cheap also.
4,Nice set,I like the size of the glasses they aren't bulky and this is nice for storage. I like that the bottoms are kind of rounded so that the water from the dishwasher doesn't sit on top of it. They are fragile though. The glass is pretty thin. I've already broke one. So I do need to be more carefull. Other than that I do like the set and would buy again.
3,Broken glass,"A nice product, but one of the 16 glasses was completely broken. Amazon seems to want us to send it back for a refund or substitute. It was completely shattered and made it difficult to open the package. Didn't seem to be a good idea to send it back. Oh well..."
5,Unique Glasses,"These are very heavy feeling, nice looking glasses. Best of all since they are shipped by Amazon they are also elgible for free shipping (no filler for you Prime members).One issue with these, if you normally stack your smaller glasses to save space, these you can't do it with."
1,Magic glasses,Another reviewer has already commented on these glasses breaking spontaneously. I will only add that each of the sixteen was broken in eight months after extremely gentle use. Save your money.
1,Lebbey Polaris Drinking Glasses & Tumblers,"I also purchased these glasses, and have only a few left!! They go into the dishwasher in one piece and come out in a few pieces. They look pretty enough but because the bottom is so heavy when they are in the dishwasher, due to the water pressure and the weight of the bottom they tip over onto the other glasses next to them, so if you are not able to secure them into your dishwasher so that they will not move, or anchor them with another bowl/or something so that they will not move they will break!!!!! They are awful!!!!!! What happened to the good old days when the glasses used to be durable."
3,Good for everyday use,"Sturdy (thus far), heavy, and simple. Certainly not elegant, but not ugly as is so much daily use glassware."
4,New glasses,A nice heavy glass that seems to be holding up well. No breakage yet. Well worth the price.
4,Attractive and Sturdy,"This are great everyday glasses. The bottoms are completely flat [no indentation] and the edges are curved. As a result, so no water collects there in the dishwasher. Would definitely buy again."
4,Nice glasses,"Originally purchased at Target three years ago and could not find more until I found them on Amazon. Good deal. One glass was broken in transit. I was not sending back but would ""eat"" the one broken glass to save on hassle of sending back.Nice weight. Holds up well in dishwasher."
4,Good customer service,"I received these as a gift for Christmas 08. 3 of the taller glasses had defects. 2 were wobbly because the bottom wasn't flat, and the lip on one was deformed. Not chipped, just not complete. I called Libbey, told them my problem and the nice lady named Debbie asked me to send an email and she would send out replacements. No questions asked. I don't have to send the old ones back. The phone call took all of 2 minutes maybe. Obviously I would prefer that the items not be deformed, but at least they address it immediately and easily."
2,Don't waste your money.,"This product looks nice, heavy duty, hard to tip over. They will last about 6 months until every single one of them start cracking for no reason what-so-ever. I put them in the dishwasher fine and NOT over crowded, top rack and every time I go to put the dishes away at least one is broken. I am now down to 9 after 6 months and I haven't even dropped them or anything!"
3,Bottom Heavy,"The glasses are very bottom heavy and nerve wracking to hand wash in the sink (they roll and tip easy), these glasses are poorly made and chip very easily. One had a bubble near the lip of the glass that was rough, so it was thrown away. Additionally, this was shipped in such an awful manner, 4 of the glasses were broken on arrival. No padding or protection whatsoever. Too much of a hassle to go through the return process seeing as this was a wedding present. Oh well. They looked cool."
3,too fragile,"These glasses are beautiful and exactly what I wanted. The Libbey name was an added factor in choosing these glasses. However. When I removed them from the packing, they looked perfect, but when I put one in the dish washer, I merely tapped the one next to it gently and the one I was holding cracked down the side. These glasses looked ""Libbey"" sturdy so I am a little disappointed to have already lost one."
3,Libbey Polaris glasses,"I bought these glasses from Target 2 years ago and really liked them. As other have said, they are heavy but they break rather easily. I've broken a few along the way and thought I'd replenish the set. I ordered them from Amazon and they arrived completely shatered - literally shards of glass falling out of the busted box. If you order them, call Amazon and request extra packing."
5,Great set of glasses!,"I have been using these for ~3 years now and I like these. Nothing extraordinary, but they do their job and look good doing it!"
4,Just glasses,"I don't have much to say, they're glasses, I use them daily, run them through the dishwasher and none have broken as of yet. The bottoms are very solid which I like, and yes that's about it. I would've loved them in green but only clear was available."
3,Nice set of glasses.,The Libbey Polaris Drinking glasses look great. The glass is pretty thick and heavy. I haven't had any issues with them cracking or breaking in the dish washer so far. My big concern is the fact that the bottoms are rounded. They're rounded enough so that you have to be very careful that you don't bump them and knock them over (especially the tall glass). I ended up giving these to a friend and buying the exact same set only with flat bottomed glasses. I'm happy with my purchase. They're cheap and pretty durable thus far and I'd buy them again if I had a choice.
1,Pretentious,If I wanted to read a book on philosophy I would have read Plato. This is the most pretentious writing I have ever read. There is no true story. It was so introspective that I had a hard time following the train of thought. I could not even finish it!
4,What a great book,This book was in excellent condition. It was a really good read and I read it straight through. I would recommend this book and any related material such as biography and autobiography of Eva Hoffman.
5,a classic now on Kindle,I loved this book when it came out and I love it still many rereadings later. So gladLost in Translation: A Life in a New Languageis now on Kindle
1,Wretched memoir.,"A memoir is supposed to about an author's life, of course. But this one is like being trapped in a closet with a raving narcissist. Eva Hoffman passes along, it seems, every thought, emotion, experience and observation she has ever had at any age, no matter how insignificant, and we're evidently supposed to believe each is important because it happened to Eva Hoffman.I felt increasingly claustrophobic. Also bored. At 41%, per my Kindle, I returned it for a refund and deleted it from my Kindle. Whew. In literature as in life, keeping company with the self-absorbed and self-important is something to be avoided. Thank you, Amazon, for refunding such misbegotten purchases."
5,The most meaningfull/insightfull immigrant biography written,"Eva Hoffman is truely a gifted writer. Her command of the English language is at a level that makes me ashamed of my U.S. ""home grown"" skill set. Reading this novel made me realize for the first time the security that a lack of freedom provides - (ie. youth, political ect.) The insecurity and fear of failure that is the halmark of true freedom"
3,Whine,I am also a Soviet immigrant so I definately identified with the first part of the book. However the rest of it seemed like she was whining about her situation. She kept separating herself from her new life which led to all her problems of not feeling like she belonged. SHe never makes an effort to learn this new lifestyle and as someone who had to do that and got used to this new life I think she was just unwilling to change at all and kept harping on her ideas that Polish life was better than American life. This just seems like a book of excuses.
2,Unsympathetic,"I didn't care for this book all that much. First, her adolescent experience as an immigrant to Canada seems heavily covered over by later-acquired learning in the philosphy of structuralism, semiotics, etc, all very fashionable nowdays. The book has more the feel of a post-mortem analysis than a personal memoir, and in trying to be both it fails on both levels.Second, I didn't find her a sympathetic character, because she herself seemed to have so little sympathy for others: Canadians were boring, dull, undemonstrative; North-American teenage life superficial; the local Jewish community obsessed with status and the notion of 'better' or 'worse' people. etc. I got the feeling of her portraying herself as a true and sensitive (European!) heart among the barbarians and the uncomprehending. Sorry, doesn't wash."
1,Kept on freezing,"I was really looking forward to this game, unfortunately the game was minus a disc and you have to proceed from each disc. The seller was great and refunded the money. Also, it kept on freezing- REALLY freezing, as in I had to manually turn off my computer every 3 minutes. I just gave up.Never even made it past a few levels. Maybe it has to be played on Windowas 98 only, not sure.If it worked I would have loved it."
4,A Gentle Evening with TownesVZ,If you want to listen to some early TVZ live you will enjoy this album. It's almost like a boot leg with his talkin' in between his songs. TVZ at his best and not apparently wasted on the wind.
4,Wheels lock. Swivels do not lock,These casters are heavy duty and work well for me. Please note that the swivels do not lock. For my tablesaw with extension and cabinet unit this is not a problem.
2,Could have been better,"This movie could have been better, the writing seemed very rushed. This could have been good but it just lacked a whole lot of something! The plot is very predictable and you pretty much know his ""secret"". I tried to like this but I just couldnt."
3,Y. Blak Has The Write Stuff,"Moore's writings are a huge departure from the fiction that I usually read - the predictable and safe stuff by the gluttony of writers on today's scene. I truly enjoyed this story. The rawness and grittiness of the dialogue and story takes me to places that I mostly likely will not see in my lifetime. Some of the outcomes of the characters were predictable, but I really thought that Solemn Shawn would have had a totally different fate. Another reason why I liked this story - no fairy tale, sunshiny day, the sun'll come out tomorrow ending. If you liked this one, read Triple Take - that one was just as good if not better."
3,A lot of good information,I am using this book as part of a six sigma course and it contains a lot of good information. On the downside I have seen some typos and some of the stat explanations were not as thorough as I would have liked. It I did not see binomial distribution table in it - I had to create my own. Aside from that it covers the topics well.
4,Familiarity,"The Six Sigma Handbook is very thou rough however, if you're not familiar with statistics I recommend a more basic statistics book to accompany this subject."
4,Wow Book,"This book is worth the price. A good guide indeed, covering theoretical perspective and making practical sense as well. A must for those new and enthusiastic readers of Six-Sigma."
4,It's The Definitive Textbook On The Topic,"In a nutshell - it is 800 pages of essential material on the topic. Yes, it is HUGE! It's as big as a Gutenburg Bible. But it is the most complete collection of reference material you will ever find. It is actually the required textbook for many of the better Black Belt Certifying courses. That being said it should be paired up and sold as a discounted package deal along with Gygi's ""Six Sigma For Dummies"". Before begining a Black Belt course you should read ""Six Sigma For Dummies"" from cover to cover prior to taking the course (300 pages). Then keep the Six Sigma Handbook close by as reference material. You will most assuredly keep both books on your shelf forever and use them frequently."
2,This is not a Six Sigma Handbook,"I bought this book because it's a Six Sigma Handbook, but unfortunately it is not, is a book of SPC, it has a lot about control charts, run charts, etc. about hypothesis testing just a little!, anyway. I have to select better my books."
3,"""Too much conversation...""","Negative Points: Define, Improve and Control phase. For a ""handbook"" it should provide a lot more examples and details.Positive Points: It gives a good idea of dashboards and projects prioritization."
3,My Six Sigma Handbook Review,"The Six Sigma Handbook was a required reading as part of the Black Belt Certification I am taking. I have read the entire handbook. I found some chapters easier to read than others. There are other books, on Six Sigma, that may easier for the novice to read. This book is a great desk-top reference for anyone who is in the manufacturing line of business because most of the examples are focused in that direction. The book does contain some transactional examples from service companies that are helpful."
4,Pyzdek Six Sigma Handbook,This is a good source and reference for the six sigma system/process. It is organized in a logical and concise order.
4,Good reference book on Six Sigma,I studied this book as part of Six Sigma Green Belt and Black Belt programs' course curriculum and was a great help to clear both my CSSGB & CSSBB certifications. Book content is very well organized and discusses the key concepts without excessive abstract stuff. Chapters are arranged in a very logical manner and provides ample scope to understand the nuances of establishing & controlling the Six Sigma culture at work place. Book also serves as a great reference to quickly refresh the concepts.
4,Great deal!,"Got this for a super low price, and it works very well - better than I thought! I got it mostly for the NOAA weather broadcasts, and it picks them up MUCH better than the Eton ""emergency"" radio I tried."
3,Not bad!,I thought this book was boring because it is about giving birth. It was boring for me because it had no fighting. The part I liked the best is when the eel was in the bag with the cat. I learned that you must keep trying no matter what the problem. Keep trying but never give up.
3,A Good Book,I thought the book was good because on some parts I felt sorry for Alyce. The part I liked was when Alyce and Will started being friends. While reading the book I learned not to give up and keep on trying. But I did't read the whole book.
4,A poor girl rises out of the ashes,"A midwife finds a girl who is poor sleeping in a dung pile in her yard. As she(Alyce, A.K.A. Beetle) becomes older, she matures and realizes what she has to do to get around in the world. As her life progresses, she saves a life or two, helps a little boy back on his feet, and is pushed around by a midwife with an attitude. If you are looking for a book that will make you laugh, cry, and laugh all over again, than you should read ""The Midwife's Apprentice"" by Karen Cushman."
4,"Fairly told tale, but still needs work","I'm a big history reader and enjoy historic fiction like everything happened the next day. The charaters, I thought, weren't to well developed and the plot was to lose for a strong hold. Still you left with a good impression of being accepted into society and being ""someone."" There should be more books like these! What I wish was there would be a little more involvment around the characters, too! Such as the girl and the boy, to me she basically hung out with the cat and kept it that way. But I'm still saying, the book could have been expanded and told in a stronger voice."
4,The Midwife's Apprentice,"This book by Karen Cushman is about a homeless girl called Beetle was named by the midewife called Jane. But later on, Beetle rename herself to be called Alyce. Since Alyce is a homeless girl, Jane saw Alyce and made her her apprentice. Alyce was bossed around and had been teased by others. Alyce had only doing chores around the house, but one time Jane had told her to do a bigger job. The job was to go and deliver a baby, but she fail. So she ran away and worked in another place.There are more to this story, if you want to know more then read this story. I think that Alyce is a pretty smart girl. Even though the village boys were teasing her, at least she doesn't have to live in the streets and can be kept warm. This book isn't really long, but it is a good one."
3,Ok but not as good as Catherine,"I read this book as a young girl after reading Cushmans other book Catherine Called Birdy. The Midwifes Apprentice is a much smaller book which was one reason I did not like it as much. I remember thinking that I enjoyed the fact that it was not sugarcoated at all and was in the middle ages but not a pretty fairy tale. In fact it is quite frank and often violent and crude but I dont think this is a bad thing though some might. Good moral about hard work and not letting people take advantage/bully you. As with Cushman's other book, historical accuracy is not really the point but it provides a good introduction to students of a certain age who are interested in the time period but not concerned with the specifics just yet."
4,Good quick read,"I adored Cushmans ""Catherine Called Birdy"" and decided to give her other works a try. This book is not nearly as immersive as Birdy, but it is not written to be like Birdy. It is a fun narrative about a peasant girl growing up and discovering her own worth in 13th century England. If you like light reading, and have a taste for historical fiction you will most likely enjoy The Midwife's Apprentice."
4,Very good book!,"I enjoyed this book very much. It's a very nice quick read for someone that likes to read, but doesn't have much free time."
5,So you want a kid's p.o.v. on a great read? Here it is.,"I highly reccomend this classic story of a young girl'shardships during the wonderful medieval period. Beetle findsherself constantly wandering the country hoping to findmerely a piece of bread and a roof to sleep under. One dayshe happens upon a friendly dung heap. She decides to takeadvantage of its warmth and shed her presence upon it forthe night. Little does she know she has come to the home ofthe midwife. She wakes to a woman screaming at her and findsherself face to face with Jane Sharp. She soon comes to bethe apprentice of this harsh woman, learning the magicsof this difficult career. The story tells of Beetle's manyadventures and difficulties during this hard time. I foundthis book a good read containing humor as well as a gooddose of reality. This is a great Newberry medal winnerrecomended for ages 12 and up, but I still liked it and I'mjust eleven. Two thumbs up!!!!!"
3,The Mysterious Apprentice!,I did this as an assignment for my humanities class.This is a story about a lady who helps women give birth & she is called the midwife. The midwife found a girl who had no home or food. She kept this girl to be her apprentice. This woman also kept the girl to help clean and get things ready for women to give birth. The apprentice had to take care of the midwife because of an accident.I would rate this book a three because the book would go from exciting to quiet. Quiet is to where nothing was really going on.I would recommend this book to someone who would like an exiting & interesting book.
3,Better the second time through.,"I read this little book in an afternoon during my student's reading time. I wasn't too impressed the first time around. Cushman tends to bog the reader down, sharing all the NEAT research she has done instead of focusing on the story. As a reader, I got bogged down, too. The second time I read it for a class and found it a much more enjoyable read. I no longer paid attention to the factual content and enjoyed the story. Parents will likely want to read and discuss it with their children."
5,Delightful,"True to the time period and a charming story of a child's life in the middle ages. I found it too short, but my students enjoyed the length (4th grade readers) and had lots of questions about the way things really were ""back then."" Strong, but realistic female main character. Enough action for my students."
3,Slow start great ending,"The reason I am writing this is because it was a class project for middle age literature circles. I rated this book with 3 stars. The reason is because this novel is fairly good, but it had a slow start. This book slowly had more action; the end of the book was great! This novel is about a young girl who lived in a dung heap. One day the midwife said she could be her apprentice. Dung beetle soon named herself Alyce. She tried to help the midwife as much as she could. She delivered a baby all by herself; soon more people heard how good she was. Alyce was scared, she ran away. Alyce worked at an Inn, she came back to the midwife. I recommend this book to someone who likes the medieval times and who enjoys reading about events in rural areas."
4,The Midwife's Apprentice Review by Markie Ray,"If you want a book that will make you sit down and make you read it again and again, this is the book for you. The Midwifes Apprentice by Karen Cushmen explains the life of a girl who has no home and becomes a midwife's apprentice. To begin, Brat is homeless and barely alive. She goes from village to village stealing what she needs, but nothing more. After that, the midwife took her in. Brat becomes her apprentice and is paid by being fed and to sleep in a warm place. Lastly brat, now known as Alyce, learns a valuable lesson. She learns never to give up and to try, try, try again. As you can see, The Midwifes Apprentice is a great book and it also teaches many lessons. So read this book to find out what happens to Alyce in this fantastic book!!!By Markie Ray"
4,The Midwife's Amazing Apprentice,"I am writing this book review, because it was assigned as a class project by my teacher.In the book The Midwife's Apprentice a cold frosty evening a girl with no home, no parents, and nothing but the name Brat finds a place to sleep in a dung heap. When later that evening the midwife finds her and not only gives her the name Beetle, but she also becomes her new apprentice. One day she messes up on an important task and runs away. She also gives herself a new name, Alyce.I rated my book a 4, because it was good more towards the middle.I would recommend this book to anybody who likes to read books or read books like this one in particular."
5,Great,"This is a wonderful story for kids about the courage of an orphan, Alyce, with a dream. Easy reading and descriptive...very enjoyable."
3,Eh...,"Well, I certainly admire Beetle's(Alyce) courage, and her ability to cope with hard situations. Otherwise, I really didn't like the book. The writing was mediocre, and a lot of the content just plain inappropriate. I gave this book three stars out of mercy. I don't reccomend this book to anyone, and definitely not elementry kids!!"
2,What a snore!,"This is an extremely tedious novel. it is about a girl who helps out a midwife but then goes and runs away to an inn. It is an elementary book. This is not interesting because all the girl wants to do is make a name for herself. You cannot relate to her at all because she doesn't do anything except chores and, well, midwifing. She doesn't think about anything else throughout the whole book and when you're done you can't believe you wasted your time on such a boring book! Sorry, Amazon, but this book is not worth your money. If you're just DYING to read it get it at a library."
2,I was disappointed,"I was disappointed by Karen Cushman's work. I think she could have done alot better, as she has done in the past. I read this book expecting alot better then what I got! Still, my time reading wasn't wasted; I learned something about midevil times, and it was very nice for some short reading."
1,This book was boring.,Maybe because I am a boy but this book was boring because the plot wasn't really on the story. The author tried to tell us too much about potions and stuff. The beginning of the story was really disgusting when Alyce was sleeping in the dung heap.
5,A wonderful read.,"... I find that some of the best books out there are in the young adult section. This was one of the best. I loved the medieval setting, and the focus on women's occupation and skill, and the subtle change in the lead character, as she starts to discover who she is and what she wants. She realizes how valuable she is, and that if a person really wants something, they have to go for it by embracing both the positive and negative aspects. Thank you, Ms. Cushman, for such a wonderful story."
4,The Midwife's Apprentice,"The Midwife's Apprentice is about a girl named Beetle. She is an orphan who doesn't know who her parents are. Beetle is found by a greedy midwife. Beetle starts working for the midwife and in return gets food. Later in the story Beetle gives herself a real name, Alice. One day Alice is asked to help give birth to a child and she fails. Alice runs away in embarrassment. She starts working at and inn. Read the book to see how The Midwife's Apprentice turned out.I really enjoyed this book because of how the author has the least expected things happen. I also liked how Alice has a brave and adventurous spirit. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who likes fairy tales."
4,"A gOoD, hEaRtWaRmInG sToRy","this book was sort of short and sweet. i don't like being bogged down in a 300 page book, so this was an awesome light read. i think that any girl from the ages of 12-14 should read this. in the book, it is about a girl with some troubles that she works to overcome. but i think it has an underlying message. it really hits on the note of not giving up. i learned from this book that the worst mistake you can ever is not being thrown down by defeat, its letting yourself stay down."
4,middle ages,"The midwifes apprentice made me think, what i wanted to do when i'm older. And how hard it was in the middle ages.Having a baby and living. I thought it was a great book and everyone should read it. The book told me that if you want to do something you are going to have to work for it."
4,The Midwife's Apprentice,"I think this is a great book. One reason I like this book is because it's back in the Middle Ages, and it makes you feel like you're in the book. When you read this book, you can get a picture of it in your head, and the chapter titles are very descriptive about what's in the chapter. I think it has a wonderful ending, and it's not too sad. This book talks about a brave & full-hearted person who does not give up even though her life might be hard."
5,"A unique blend of piano, electronics, and feeling","It doesn't have to be raining to enjoy Color Theory, but it is preferred. Brian Hazard (aka Color Theory) reintroduces the long-lost art of singer-songwriter for the piano (and accompanying electronics). Themes range from melancholy romantic musings in ""September Spoke In Red"" to the more upbeat gaity of ""Heart Like A Doll"". All the songs deal with love (either lost or gained) in some way, but there is considerable breadth and interest in the way they are presented. The performance is great, as Hazard has a very pleasant voice that wonderfully accompanies his deft piano arrangements. This is a great CD to listen to and relax, unwind. This isn't to say that it is all slow,...... oh, quit listening to me, just buy it already......"
5,A Synthpop Classic,"If you enjoy synthpop (and by that I mean music mainly driven by synthesizers) this album is a must for your collection. The songs are passionate, heartfelt and beautifully written. I was going to pick out a couple of songs to point out as favorites but couldn't do it. I highly reccomend listening to the clips, I am sure you will be hooked."
3,The First Romance I Ever Read,This was the first romance I had ever read. It is only three stars because at times I found the plot slow but all and all it is a fairly good read. There are some plot twists that are very reminisent of a daytime soap opera. And even though the characters are likable they have a tendency to be a little too off beat. But if you like free spirited women wrapping strong willed males around there little finger you wouldn't go wrong.
2,Disappointing Recording of a Mediocre Opera,"The composer Alfano gained fame for having completed Turandot after Puccini's death. Aside from that, he is virtually unknown. Cyrano de Bergerac is one of his later efforts, featuring lackluster music with no memorable melodies. The cast of the Kiel Opera's live recording don't improve matters. Maybe it was because of fatigue, unfamiliarity with French, or just lack of talent. They are not in good voice, have pronunciation issues, and sometimes can barely be heard. In particular Uhl's voice is shrill and wobbly. Hardly someone who would inspire a lifelong love: As if that weren't enough, the libretto, in French with English translation, has grammatical errors and is occasionally incomplete."
5,"If you have a 1x42 belt sander, then","These are the belts to use. They are long lasting, heavy duty belts with a heavy cloth backing. I live on my belt sander and these are the only belts I use because they last longer and hold up the best."
3,"great resource, information not 100% complete","i was very excited about this book but was dissapointed to find not all the drawings in the book are included in the cd-rom. you shouldn't trust the eps files, but make your own from the dxf's. some eps files are incomplete, at least when opened from photoshop.sometimes a layer seems to be missing- there are no walls in the section for the guggenheim new york. some buildings will have more drawings than others, which is fine, but it's confusing to see drawings in the book and then not find them in the cd-rom.however, it's still a great and much needed resource. i just wish the cd had been more carefully reviewed."
2,Not good enough,Not pretty enough for a coffee table book and definitely not informative enough as a resource for an architecture student.
3,instant coffe,I drink this a lot for a while but after I found out and tried this[...] I switched completely. The different between this vinacafe and nescafe is that nescafe doesn't have milk and it have a stronger coffee taste. If you like to drink vietnamese drip coffee then you would love this nescafe instant black coffee.
3,Good for the price,"For the price, this is a good pregnancy wedge. I can still roll onto my back sometimes, but it seems to keep my abdomen at an angel at least. It's good for leaning against when sitting in bed reading/watching tv, but it is a little hard. The two halves are connected by velcro and the pillow sometimes does shift in the middle of the night, which rubs the rough velcro against you and hurts. Overall though, it keeps you on your side and considering its price compared to others out there, I recommend it."
2,just so so,"I didn't find this pillow to be of much support or use in my pregnancy. The velcro came unattached fairly easily, and it got shifted into a million wrong positions very easily as well. I purchased a full body pillow that curved at the top and bottom for support, and while it was a space taker in the bed, it was much more comfy and useful than this thing. This ended up accumulating dust under my bed instead of actually being used."
2,Like sleeping in a jail,"I tried this around 5 or 6 months pregnant and found it left me in even more joint pain than the over-sized body pillow I was hoping to replace. I now use a smaller belly pillow by Boppy and I sleep quite well most nights.I might try this sleeping prison again when I get much better, but as of now I wouldn't recommend it."
4,"Great guitar, grating vocals.","Granted, it is obvious that the guitar work here, is worthy of placement among the best blues records out there. But as always, Winters vocals range from the grating, to the almost comical charactures, they devolved into later(and not much later at that),in his career.The guitar work deserves 6 stars, minus 2 for the vocals = 4."
3,The Ladder of Divine Ascent,"Albeit, any translation of this book from the Greek will find itself lacking, this particular edition is found wanting in comparison with Orthodox translations. Paulist Press, being a Roman Catholic publishing institution, tends to put a more western translation to a, very, Eastern Orthodox writing. In comparison to the edition published by Holy Transfiguration Monastery, this book, published by Paulist Press, is an inferior rendering of the original document, and very slanted towards western spirituality.For western readers, this would be, somewhat, an ""easy read"", but this translation will not provide the full impact of the meanings from the original."
1,Fulfilling work... wonting translation.,"While no objections can be made to this work itself (the 'Ladder' is one of the greater spiritual texts in human history), it is this particular translation of the text that must be criticised. This edition is wonting in the original tone of the Greek, little of which has been preserved in its English rendition.Perhaps more upsetting is the 'insertion' into the translation of much Western religious sentiment that is not apparent in Maximus' original Greek. This is fundamentally an Eastern text from an early period, and its translation 'into' a modern Western framework does a great injustice both to the text and to the reader.Only one star for this volume: those who are considering reading the 'Ladder' would do themselves much better to find one of the various other translations available, such as that by the Transfiguration Monastery, or HMC Press (the latter available hereon Amazon.com)."
1,Wish there was an option for ZERO number of stars to give this product!,"My son got it for a Christmas present since he's a car lover. It NEVER worked. It should be called ""Piece of Junk Jalopy"" because that's what it is. There is NO WAY to contact the company and no where to return it. Don't waste your money on ANYTHING from Hilco Corporation. You'd be better off buying a well-known brand that supports its products rather than a POS brand like Hilco."
4,Good decoration piece for cheap,"Visually Appealing, very romantic, but It's just poster paper, I framed it so you can't really tell. No white edges all around. Perfect for above my bed."
3,Disappointing,"After purchasing this print, I never hung it. I was thoroughly disappointed when I received it. The print quality is blurred and it does not look as it did online. I'm thinking about hanging it in a guest bathroom just so it doesn't go to waste, but had I known what it truly looked like before I purchased it, I would not have given it a second thought."
3,"all locks, same key","Be aware, all locks have the same key, that wasn't properly explained in the item."
5,"tai chi clans, ninjas, shaolin chiefs and abbots clash","The entire movie contains 40 minutes of action. I gaurantee that this movie will keep you on the tips of your toes. There is a large amount of wire-work in this film as compared to other class gung fu movies. No training sequences were involved. This movie is really underrated. If you are new to the shaw brothers films, this is a good movie to start off with."
1,Disappointing toy,"We were very disappointed with this toy and I wish I'd read the reviews before I bought it. It worked ok the first time or two, but by the third time the fish just kept getting stuck. As with most musical toys, the music was ok at first, but quickly became monotonous. My 4-year old was very excited but found it frustrating to wait for the fish as they sometimes took a couple of minutes to make it out. And he had a friend by two days after we got the toy and they were both so bored with waiting for the fish that they wandered off to do something else while I tried to make it work and had no desire to come back to try again.Save you money."
2,Author makes his own assumptions,"The ""answers"" given by the author in four of the first five stories were highly questionable. The author appears to make his own assumptions, supposedly based on ""facts"" that were NOT revealed in the mystery.For example, one story involves a balloon found in a tree in the neighbor's backyard. The story states that (at the time the balloon was noticed) ""there was no wind."" The answer is based on the idea that there was no wind to blow the balloon from one yard to another and therefore it had to be planted there. But the story did not state WHEN the balloon made its way into the tree ... it could have been earlier in the day or it could have been the day before - these were times when the wind might have been blowing!"
5,Set amid the natural beauty of Montana and Idaho,"Set amid the natural beauty of Montana and Idaho, A High, Lonesome Call: One Man, Two Bird Dogs, And The Open Road That Is Their Answer by sportswriter Robert Holthouse is a superbly written novel of searching, self-reflection, and respect for wild grandeur. Drawing upon autobiographical experience, Holthouser wonderfully captures the essence of the hunt and the bond between a man and his faithful canine companions. A thoughtful, serious, soul-deepening read."
5,My new favorite,"This book was absolutely genius. I was heartbroken when I finished it, and felt like I could let it go on forever without getting tired of it. I felt like I was riding/hunting right along with this trio and couldn't get enough of the true life stories. The tales seem real and not contrived like many other writers that I've read. This book was much more than just about bird hunting but included life's crappy moments and some of the most humorous. Wonderful writer."
4,Travels With Pete,"This was a great book to read from a man's point of view. Similar to Steinbeck's ""Travels With Charlie"", the book creates a longing for the wide open country. As a woman who cares for and loves my husband's hunting dogs, I could relate to the scenario - man alone on hunt with dog(s)."
3,A fair deal,"This is a honest guide. Well organized, but it doesn't have the ""special tip"" factor, that you can find on others guides."
3,"Great book, but not for a first-time visitor","I bought this book along with the Frommer's 2008 guide for my first visit to NYC. Although I loved the included subway map and the way the book is organized, I didn't find it as helpful as a stand-alone book. I relied more on the Frommer's as a first-time visitor. I would recommend getting this book, but not for a first-time visitor. I am using it to plan my next trip to the city, though!"
3,Ok if you don't have an iPhone,"I worked in NYC for three years and kept this in my briefcase for mostly subway and restaurant info. To tell you the truth, my iPhone apps replaced this whole damn book. And you don't have to lug around a small book which looks like you're about to knock on someone's front door and start preaching about the bible."
3,They aren't kidding,"I checked this book out from the library and dropped it in my suitcase without looking at it right before a trip to New York. I assumed the title was pandering to every person's belief that they are not a tourist--that's everyone ELSE. Well, I didn't need to find any hardware stores or pet supply stores so this book never left my hotel room. I am sure it's a great book but don't think of it as a travel guide. So my 3-star rating is an average of 4 stars for what it probably is, and 2 stars for what I thought it was!"
4,Ladies' Day,"I'm objective about this book, and I declare it a real winner.Although it's about women ""breaking into"" the great national pastime,men will find the historic aspects of interest, as well. The fact that the author quotes a ""Washington Post"" article of mine on the subject of the first Ladies Day Game played in the nation's capital does not influence my favorable opinion. It is a well researched and well credited book. I would hasten to recommend it."
2,It isn't easy to make Pushtu easy,I have been studying the Pasto/Pushtu language for years. It hasn't been easy and this book didn't make it any easier.
4,"Great Story, Great Art, But tell me Why the Sithing Hell Does Kyp have Blond Hair on the Cover??","Excellent art, great story. I want to hear more about Kyp but am doubtlessly doomed to disappointment with clueless merchandisers. Fascinating character, again, LOVED the story but why in Sithing Hell is Kyp Blond on the Cover? Idiot colorist."
1,This product is no longer manufactured,"I was contacted by the seller and told that this product is no longer manufactured. They did have one in stock however it had shipping damages and could not be sent to me.The seller was very courteous and informed me that my payment would be refunded, which he did promptly."
4,An impressive debut,"I love a good mystery, but I was intrigued by this author because her father (Jim Harrison) is one of my favorite authors. She stands on her own as a mystery author though, creating likeable, human characters in a fresh setting. I was still guessing up until the last dozen pages. I look forward to more adventures with Sheriff Jules Clement"
3,hmm..........,"The dixie chicks are my fave band, but howcome the karaoke album only has one song on it from Fly, and all the rest are Wide Open Spaces?"
5,Essential Party CD!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"If you are having a party, this cd has to be one that you play. The amount of artists on this cd, ranging from Tina Ann to Amber to Da Buzz to Kim English to Deborah Cox ( I could go on ), is amazing. This cd is full of quality songs. For me, it doesn't get better than tracks 7-9. Just listen to ""One Good Reason"" flowing into ""Let me Love You"" into ""In MY Dreams"" and tell me you don't get full of energy and pumped up....i dare ya. Towards the end, when most cd's trail off, you get Kim Sozzi's ""Feelin Me"" done with an awesome extended beginning. The mixing is incredible on this album, as the songs flow evenly and actually blend together. Louie at his best here."
3,Aye.... coulda do betta =),"I kinda feel dat dis CD dont reallly apply to louie, cuz i heard him live millions of times, dis sounds too much like remixes... go back to where he was in Vol. 3. And just one other thing, dont diss him, he can mix betta than most of the Djs out there, just becuz dis Cd anit dat great, doesnt mean he blows. Hear him live, it's madd good =)if ya'll like his songs, should download some Tony Draper, PPK, DJ Shark's songs =)"
2,Hold your horses! BUYER BEWARE,"Now just wait a minute here. This CD is listed ""new"" April 23, 2002 and these songs are well, in hyper-accelerated dance-time, OLD!Come on, look at the list of songs. Most of these were out last year and some even older.If you want a ""retrospective"" of cheese trance (no offense, I like the songs) go for it.Just don't complain when you listen to this ""hottest new release""."
5,Great mixing,"Dance factory is the type of CDs you've just gotta play them Saturday nights you can't make it 2 the club. It's got everything ya need plus in a perfect blending. I mean, from the intro to the 5 minute remix by Bad boy Joe at the end, you got 70 minutes of pure dance wonderfully mixed. I'm not sayin Louie de Vito is da best DJ out there or anything like that; but he's started his carreer. My favorite tracks r ""Yes"" by Amber, ""Heaven"" by Yanou and DJ Sammy (of course), ""Played @ live (Safri duo..makes u feel like you're at a brasilian carnaval), Resurrection by PPK...Man, this CD is great. Get it! If you're a fan of DJ Quicksilver, TNR, Brooklyn bounce, 666...you'll love this.."
2,Too much Trance,"I was very disapointed with this CD and i think it sounds too...plastic. Very much west-coast club scene.Way too fast and not enough spirit behind the music. If you want good techno, look elsewhere!If you just want some booty-shakin, hip-grinding club beats, then this is certainly for you.Not my bag, but to each their own."
1,Old Skool,"Is this a joke? Just look @ the track list. These songs are so old the cheese is starting to smell. I saw Louie DeVito spin LIVE in Hartford, CT 2 weeks ago and he was one of the BEST shows i've seen. I thought this CD would reflect some of his new mixes. I've had every single track on this ""new"" CD for a long time. We want NEW stuff Mr. DeVito. To sum it up in one word ... Disappointing"
1,Louie DeVito Needs to give it a rest!!!,"This CD is an insult to music fans and DJ's around the world. Devito is the Back Street Boys of DJing. He simply takes top 40 dance tracks, puts them on a cd and calles it mixed. I am glad he saved New York the embarrassment of using the City's name in the tile as he did in the past. He is the poorest reflection of the whole NYC dance scene. He must have a great marketing team for people to by this [stuff]. This guy is a joke!"
5,Incredibly cool and complex music,"I picked up this CD because I loved ""Dream"" and my local DJ was getting tired of my constant pestering for him to play it. I was greatly impressed. Every song on this CD is incredibly complex, with samples, processed vocals, and neato instruments like sitar and bagpipes weaving in and out. Perhaps the greatest is the sample of a ""Speak and Spell"" on ""Infinite Cow."" Every time I listen to this album--and it begs you to listen closely--I hear something new spliced in there. This album is probably not for the average modern-rock fan, but is a welcome sign that heavily electronicized music can really be creative and interesting."
4,excellent,"I have an uncle who was at University Of Conneticut from 1968-72, doing all those things people did on college property in those days.But he is no foggie and knows about new music, and he hipped his psychadelic little nephew to Forest For The Tress.You will never mistake this album for a 1960s college dorm party disc. It is full of modern hip hop beats. But it also has screaming, Vernon Ried guitar, chants, sitars, and all kinds of updated cosmis wizzard play.It is like a Bombay dance rave, and you should set your third eye on this."
4,Excellent But Not Publicized CD,"This CD was one of the great ""not-too-known"" groups that you don't hear about. But they are so creative in thier music, I just had to have it. I'm glad I had the chance to find it. Good Buy!"
2,Original -boring!,"I bought this Cd because I liked the single ""Dream"" and because Carl Stephenson was a part of Becks hit ""Loser"". I was pretty much dissapointed because the songs just drag on even though they are very original. I need something that will make me move (not move my hand to change the track). The only time I will be playing this CD is if I feel like listening to ""Dream"". Better luck next time Carl ""loony"" Stephenson."
3,"good dictionary, poorly made","just received my copy of this dictionary, and it seems to be pretty good, HOWEVER the binding at the back has already split (after only two hours of use!). be prepared to do some bookbinding if you buy this dictionary."
4,This is an awesome oil!,This oil smells heavenly and works great over sunscreen. I'm not sure what the other reviewer is talking about as the ingredients are clearly listed on the back of the bottle. It doesn't smell a thing like roses if anyone is concerned about that. It has a very fresh tropical fragrance and is not overly greasy. Enjoy!
1,LIST INGREDIENTS?,"Interesting idea, great price, but the millions of us out here with topical allergies NEED to see full disclosure on ingredients. Try again, guys!"
3,The Adult Album,Being A Entertainment Attorney in Washington DC it's refreshing to see a well put together album representing the entire area of DC Maryland and VA. My office looks forward to hearing some more from this new brother named Cornell Stone. Good luck my brother.
5,Love them,"I got a red pair and a black pair, and i love them mainly when i have my pockets full of stuff, my pants stay in place and not drop down to my knees."
5,Good deal,"I am totally happy with this text. Other students in the course purchased it through the school bookstore and they are missing an entire chapter. Arrived in good condition. Took a little longer than I had hoped, but given that everything including CD and all chapters were present... =)"
1,lame,"this book had some potential but it was a silly romance dressed up as a fantasy. And are you kidding me about the Coelura, fancy little creatures that create pretty clothes? come on, now. Anyway I was disappointed but i guess this was a quick right to publish something and the sequal ""Nerilka's story"" wasn't much better."
1,Too much to pay,"This indeed should have been a short story - I feel like I have been cheated to pay the price for a book 156 pages long, in 14 point type with every other page a poorly drawn picture. At first I thought its a children's book and I made a mistake in buying it, then the subject matter is not children's material. I purchased this book on my faith in Anne mcCafrey. I will not make that mistake again with any publisher/book."
4,Wish it were longer,"I wish this book had been a full length novel -- with sequels!!! The book ""Coelura"" was so good,I couldn't put it down.I only wish that there had been more of it and that Anne McCaffrey had decided to make it into a series!"
2,A short story... too short.. could have been beefed up,"The girl is not being forced to marry, her father requests that she considers this suitor who turns out to be a real looser. She blows him off and decides to go hunting for awhile. Then she meets someone much more interesting, by accident. Given the fact I'm a major ""ROWAN"" series fan, Anne McCaffrey must have jotted this down in half an hour or less. It could have been so much more. Elsie"
4,"Inmagative and entertaining, well worth your time!!!!",I have read this book numerous times over a six year period and it still is wonderful enough to experience again years after. Definetly a worthy additon to McCaffery's extensive collection. In a colorful and furturistic world A.M. never loses site of of her characters. Lady Carrisa is a high born heiress who is struggling for independence and happiness. In her struggle for love she encounters a mysterious man and a secret that will forever change her life.
4,"Good overview of what makes up a ""cult""","This introduction to the OM Guide to Cults and Religious Movements gives plenty of information about what a cult is. It is written in outline form, which makes it a little hard to follow. Also, the examples are haphazard, which means there is a lot of bouncing around and not a whole lot of depth about any particular group. (I guess the more you already know about a group, the better you will understand, but I guess that's what the rest of the series is about.) Overall, though, if you want to skim through this in an hour, you would have good information from which to work."
4,Brief but interesting,"About 300 pages long with 2-3 articles per page. It is probably not useful for highly knowledgeable Egyptologists (for example, the stunning site of Abu Simbal gets about half a page - whereas a book could be written on it) but is a very compact resource for those who know a little and want to find out about particular topics. Or you can just flick through it and read about particular topics as they catch your eye - the maps, illustrations and photos are well selected and quite attractive. Also, since it is written by Englishmen it is mercifully quite free of the tedious P.C. stuff that is so prevalent in the academy today."
4,Easy to read with very minor complications,This is a fantastic book! It helped my kids with their projects about Egypt. I reccomend this book to everyone!
5,mom of twins,"i love this product. it's really cold out now and it covers them up great, but i hate the collar. it is always folding in."
4,Great in the winter for both carseat and bjorn,"This cover worked wonderfully for us until our daughter's legs could no longer be contained with it on the car seat. So the taller your baby, the less time you'll be able to use it. It blocked out wind and rain well, but without a cover over her face, we had to arrange the flaps just right to protect her in severe weather. Might recommend one that has a face flap instead. However, I gave it 4 stars because it also worked really well as a cover over the bjorn (front carrier). We put her head through the opening, then pulled the rest down around her hanging legs. It kept her warm and dry as we walked, and we were able to get a lot of use out of it like this."
5,A must for any baby in cold weather,"I ordered this along with the Kiddopotamus Snuzzler Complete Head and Body Support. A must for any mom with a baby in cold weather. When my son was born in December, my husband and I fought with draping a blanket over the carseat/carrier to keep the cold winds off of him. We found a similar cover at Wal-Mart a couple weeks after he was born and loved it. But, it wasn't very well made which is why we ordered this one for our second child. This was actually cheaper than the first one we bought and much better made. We are also happy with the head and body support, which we did not have for our first child. Thanks Kiddopotamus"
2,Not as good as I had hoped...,"I got this cover after a child carseat inspector told me that the one I was using (the Bundle Me - which i love!) was not safe for the car seat and instead i should have one of these shower-cap type covers. I liked this at first, but now I notice that my DD turns her head and ends up underneath it - when she's fussing and i'm driving it makes me very nervous. I started taking it off once I get in the car. I miss my Bundle Me!"
2,Waste of money,"It wasnt warm enough for me to shun the blankets entirely, and my 7 month old could kick it hard enough for the elastic to snap out of the infant seat and bundle up next to him. Besides it is for infant carriers and not strollers as advertised. I couldnt use it till the recommended weight limit since it was small. A footmuff and a hat is the way to go!"
2,Not very warm looking,"I guess kiddopotamus changed the design of this item. They used to make them in soft, thick fleece. Now it's thin and cheap looking. I think this would be good for protecting baby from a draft but definitely not good for warmth. You'd have to put a couple blankets over the baby inside to make sure he or she is warm enough."
4,cold winter best friend,"great for my baby get in and out the car, or a little walk in the stroller. I like it!"
4,Worth the money but it could have been so much more,"This book of color plates seems amazing, and almost is. However, the quality of the plates falls short of the mark. The colors are dull and faded, and the image resolution far lower than it should be. The Chi Rho page, probably the most beautiful page in the Book of Kells, shows almost none of the amazingly minute detail that it should. Other books--like the Thames & Hudson--show far more detail with more vivid colors than this. On the other hand, this book has larger pages than others, which is nice."
3,art,"The Book of Kells was some what of a disappointment to me. The art work from this ancient book is beautiful,but I was expecting more commentary on the work. It also a very thin soft cover book which will in time be creased and damaged. I wanted more backstory since I tend to be a ancient art buff. But if all you are interested in is the art and only wanted to see the intricate designs its fine."
4,A very solid book for this busy generation,"This book is about creating a window of time in your daily life to have enough quiet, solitude, and peace to worship God. It not only emphasizes the importance of doing this, but gives very pragmatic examples and pointers that may help the reader ""order their private world"". It is not a theological book. It is not a very dense read. In fact, it is a very easy read. I would call it a very simple, straight forward read chalked full of excellent ideas. I recommended it to my friend in seminary as he gets really busy moving into his pastoral calling. But, it was also extremely helpful for me as a very busy businessman. It really caters to a broad audience. I give it a 4 stars because of all the Christian books I've read, it's not in my hall of fame, but it's definitely a book worth reading."
4,Conversation Starter for Small Groups,"I have read MacDonald's books in the past, and found them very thought provoking. This particular book is especially useful in Small Groups. The group I am currently leading reads the book together at the meeting, and discusses it as we go along. There are discussion questions in the back of the book, but we seldom get to them. One caveat; this book has undergone a few updates. Although the different versions can be used together, it is much easier (and less distracting) if all are using the same version. If buying it ""used"" this might be something to watch for."
2,Mine's already in order. How about yours?,"If your world is topsy-turvy, this is a great read for you. I found it only so-so. For those who need some order in their ""private world,"" give it a read. For those who are plugging along just fine, skip it."
1,Ordering Your Private World,"This book is a must read for everyone caught up in busyness. It starts slow and the early chapters might turn off those with deep beliefs in striving to achieve - but read on. Everyone must set priorities that are realistic and in accord with one's gifts. Those priorities must (absolutely must) include family, spouse, and spiritual concerns. Chapters 9 and 10 are where the rubber hit the road for me, and I am using hindsight to make that judgment. Sixty to Eighty hour work weeks don't cut it and put me out of touch with God and family."
3,A pamphlet would have sufficed.,"I'm sure the content of this book is very helpful, but at 256 pages it's about 200 pages too long. Repetitive and predictable illustrations, nearly baseless speculations about biblical characters, paragraphs made of five sentences that all say the same thing... WAY too much padding, too much fluff. Find a synopsis online (a decent review will do), and only read the book if you must."
5,Good,I orderd the book and got a good conditioned book. So I am convinced.I wanna buy another books in this company. ^^
5,"Insightful, helpful, Christ-centered","This is a wonderful publication. Gordon MacDonald speaks from years of experience in his own Christian walk. His writing style is very approachable, and everything he says is relatable to a wide audience. This is not a ""how to"" book, but rather a picture of what he sees as an ordered private world. I highly recommend this for any Christian seeking more order and peace in their private lives, even if you don't feel the pressing need to re-order."
5,Excellent Study,"Your list should include 'Faith based, Christian'.""Ordering Your Private World"" is an outstanding book that helps one to look into one's motivations for the work he/she is doing and how they manage stress and organization. When God has called you to a vocation, one goes about life if a different way than someone who is ""driven"" to succeed. God provides the guidance to success, as He sees it. His way is always the best way."
5,like alot,i really love the tummy toners. i like the 10 min. solutions so if i want i can do one or 5 workouts. these seem to really work i can really feel it in my tummy and abs.
4,abs video,"So far this video tape is fantastic! I may not physically see a difference yet, (I've only been doing it intermittenly for a few weeks), but when I did not do the tape for one whole week I felt as though I could feel a ""loosening"" of my abs.Some of the exercises are very difficult, but they say ""no pain, no gain"". What I like very much about the video is that as hard as the exercises are...they are over quick enough that it makes it all bearable. I would highly recommend this video, especially for the price!!"
3,love bikini belly,I bought this along with several other fitness dvd's. I use this one in coordination with another full body workout and have enjoyed it. I especially like the Bikini Belly and Ab & Waist Definer sections.
2,Not cool.,"This is not fun. I will tell you the good and the bad.The good: good graphics and lots of characters. The bad: real hard,hard to do tricks and you collect letters ( like in the alphlabet.) If I were you I would not buy this game."
4,Great game / music / action / challenge and excitement,"Tony Hawk Pro Skater is a top of the line game, top of the line game, because of its control, gameplay, music and overall fun. There are a dozen popular skaters to chose from, each with their own tricks and talents. Each skater has about ten original, official and detailed skateboard, which you may customize the look of. The point of the game is you can either practice to learn the tricks, or you can take on seven skateboard courses, three skate parks. Every course is extremely detailed, and has five challenges for you to accomplish. You will have to go back through some courses to get all of the challenges, so you will not breeze through the game in a day. The down side is that there is no customizable skate park or skate boarder. You can begin this game and have fun and you can be a master at this game and still have fun. If you are concerned with the message there are no helmets or pads in this game."
4,Tiny Hawk's Pro Skater,"The greatest game ti ever come to the Nintendo 64. I've played the Playstation version of it and I own the N64 version. I prefer the psx version, because the sound is better. But the n64 version is much easier to control. I gave it four stars because sometimes in multi-player, it feels kinda weird and the game slows down a little bit, but It won't bother you. I've had this game since April 2000. And I still play it! It just feels so good to go there and pull of a combo. This is my second favorite game, close behind Madden 2000!"
3,4 words!,"Get it on playstation.Its not a REALLL bad conversion, but I've played both, and the PSX has better control, along with music, graphics, and ease of gameplay. If you haven't played the PSX version, do it before you buy this game."
4,"Good Game, Missing a Few Things","This game is good. It has the basic features and moves and levels. Its fun to play as you try and advance your man through his career. Also, it becomes very addictive. However, Tony Hawk Pro Skater 2 is out and has some incredible upgrades with new levels, people, and career options. I would recommend buying the newer version of this game, but don't get me wrong, this one is good too."
5,I'm in awe,"This has got to be one of the best games ever for the N64. The graphics are incredible. It's got an awesome soundtrack (the soundrack is also a lot better for younger gamers than the Playstation version bcause it doesn't have any swear words in the lyrics). And, something most people don't know about, this game is filled with codes and secrets (sorry, but you'll have to figure those out by yourself). If you already have Super Smash Bros (which is the BEST GAME EVER MADE!) then by all means by Tony Hawk's Pro Skater! (By the way, a great place to find codes for this game is the Code Bank ...)"
2,Is That Tony Hawk?,"Okay. This game ... If you think this game is good, play Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 and see what you think after that. This game lacks good graphics and doesn't have enough tricks to keep you awake. I mean, come on! One lip trick?! Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 has plenty of lip tricks, grab tricks, flip tricks, and specials. Plus, on Pro Skater 2 you have the ability to decide what tricks are performed for which button. If you are a true Tony Hawk fan, don't get this game. It will upset you to much."
2,WHAT HAPPEND!!!,"Finally a skateboarding game for N64, and it's ...! This isnothing like the PlayStation version. First off, the music is .... It is just repetive. Second off, the sound affects are nothing compared to the PlayStation one (I would give the PlayStation one 5 stars). Buy it if you don't have a PlayStation, but if you have a PlayStation, buy it for PlayStation."
2,Oldies,"Game got here quickly, but kinda hard to get started. Doesn't want to work all the time, but when it finally turns on it works great."
3,What's up with the music??,"As a mom who bought the game for my 7-year-old son for Christmas I have to say how disappointed I am with the rating on it as appropriate for ages six and up. The graphics and game itself look interesting and ""wholesome"" enough, but what is up with the psycho-music? And ""psycho""-something illegible that rhymes with ""itch"" is the gist of the entire soundtrack that I have heard. It's really pathetic that the designers can't think of something else to skate to except this intense, pulsating, nerve-wracking (is it punk, heavy-metal, rap?) noise. Needless to say, I've ""sent it back to the North Pole"" to exchange it for something milder and more child-friendly!"
3,A bit easy,Tony Hawks Pro Skater I thought was a cool game when I first played it. But when I got it myself I realized that this game is way to easy to beat and the point values are [messed up]. For example a kickflip is worth 100 points but so is a 360 degree spin. I know from experience in real life that a kickflip is much easier than a 360 degree ollie. The fun part of this game is multiplayer. You actually get to do something challenging for once. I would recomend getting Tony Hawks Pro Sk8er 2. It is a bit more challenging.
1,Conrol is impossible to learn!,"This game has control that has a HUGE learning curve, and is still difficult to handle! And don't give me anything about ""Not playing it enough."". I've played it for about 5 hours straight and I don't get any better. But then again, I can kick *** in games like Perfect Dark and Super Mario 64.The graphics are two thumbs WAY down, and this game was made for intellectually challenged people who stupidly try to imitate professional skaters and end up breaking their neck. Ha!Overall, the control ruins this game."
3,It was a pretty good game,I do not own this but have rented a few times. I find the graphics are good and the quality of the game is good. If you are just learning the game it is hard to figure out every thing and the really good tricks are harf to pull off with the controller. But overall it is not that bad
4,tony hawk pro skater 64,"This is one of the better games for the nintendo 64. Top 10 definitely. Cool music, cool tricks, and it's fairly easy to learn. If you can't meet the goals, you can find cheat codes that work online to help you. Top 10? Maybe even top 5."
3,Ok for a quick bowl,"I've fallen in love with Pho, but live in a remote area where there are not many ethnic restaurants. This was a super quick and easy way to make a bowl of pho on a cold rainy evening. The flavor is great, but it is extremely salty! I ended up having to water down the broth quite a bit to make up for how salty it was. But, again, for a bowl of Pho to just take a few minutes was pretty impressive."
2,Only one box,"The web site descibe the quatity as 8*42, so it suppose to be 8 box of pantiliner, and each box contains 42 pieces. However, when I receive my order, there is only one box. The price is way to high for one box of pantiliner. I returned it and ask for refund. They process the refund in a timely manner."
4,not the best,"great models, great places, great suits...but too many blondes...great dvd but i prefer the other ones."
1,USE THE MONEY FOR THIS TOWARDS ONE THAT WORKS!,"I feel a responsibility to let you all know of the shortcomings of this ""style"" tile cutter. #1 is very simple but often overlooked. See the little rubber feet on the corners? These actually suspend the cutter an 1/8"" or so above the floor. Which causes the entire cutter to flex when the necessary downward pressure is applied. Which leads me to #2, the base. It's a very thin metal, about 1/16"" +/- and worsens problem #1. #3 is the circle cutter. Novel idea and selling point but is effective only if your tile is made of clay...... soft clay. A decent starter cutter would be a Plasplugs or Hyde."
1,"Nice idea, poor quality, poor performance","I agree with the other reviewer. I saw this as a closeout in a tool store and bought it because it was a traditional style with hole cutter. After I got it home and set it up, I messed up my first tile and that was enough. Score performance is poor due to binding rails and shifting tile, making the score line waver. Breaking ability is also poor with lots of flex in the base that causes the tile to break incorrectly.Overall, a very poor quality piece of junk that delivers poor performance. I am returning the unit today for a refund. The same unit is sold under many sites. Avoid them all."
3,quincy jones ultimate collection.,love most of the songs HOWEVER i failed to read some of the versions of some of the recordings. body heat one of my favorites was record as a single. i was ultimately disappointed because the instrumentation on the long album version is one of the sexiest and it was the first cut. i will just have to get the original body heat cd.
2,Q unhappy,I was really looking forward to listening to this CD. If you loved Jook Joint and Back On The Block you will be disappointed with this CD.
1,VERY SLOW SERVICE,"To receive this cd I had been waiting a long time, almost two months.Bad serviceEleonora"
5,Quite a phenomenal collection of Quincy's best!,"This is such a phenomenal album for its 79 minutes! Quincy Jones has to be the best composer in the business. He knows how to make superb songs. The album starts a little slow at first with some of his early '70s offerings, but the quality and musicianship is superb. Then when it gets funky to Stuff Like That, Ai No Corrida and the Dude album's hits, the energy picks up! It later shifts to his hits from Back on the Block and the beautiful ""The Secret Garden."" And to selections from Q's Jook Joint. Only Quincy could gather Al B Sure, James Ingram, El DeBarge and Barry White onto one song and make it an R&B classic. And Tamia's song still sounds wonderful. At times it feels like a James Ingram/ Patti Austin album because those singers appeared on a lot of Quincy's albums. But that stops when you hear other singers like Tevin Campbell on this album. This is such a remarkable album of timeless songs that are still well received today."
3,Much smaller than you think it will be!,This was chosen by my son. He seems to really like it but both of us were really surprised when we opened it and found it to be smaller than we had pictured. So you may want to just check out the dimensions before purchase. He didn't care too much though and seems to enjoy it. Everything else was as expected.
2,"Overpriced, and lots of errors","This compilation appears to be based largely on the earlier Kurdish-English/English-Kurdish dictionary of Baran Rizgar, published in the United Kingdom and available from Amazon UK. Unfortunately, this ""glossary"" does not include the English-Kurdish portion, and, more importantly, contains a great many errors. Readers would do better to purchase the Rizgar dictionary, which is not only more accurate but also substantially cheaper than this."
5,Tulis Pro Heel Cup,"My 8 year old son was experiencing pain in both heels during soccer season. The Tulis Pro Heel Cups were recommended by another family with the same problem. Our doctor recommeded stretching, icing the areas, and some time off from soccer and heel cups. The Tulis Pro Heel Cups provide much relief for my son. Most cups in the stores do not protect the back of the heel. The Tulis Pro Heel Cup comes up near the achilles tendon for a secure fit in the shoe. I ordered several pairs to have in all of his shoes. My 16 year old daughter tried a pair in her soccer cleats and loves them."
1,party planner,"Don't like this book so much. It does not have a lot of ideas.The ideas shown are very common, nothing very original.YOu will find a lot more ideas just surfing on internet.I don't recommend this book."
4,Best thing out there on the subject,"Not great not bad, but most importantly it is better than anything I have found so far on the subject. Putting together some ideas for catering a fun kids party has been quite challenging for me and this book gave me ideas. This was the most important aspect of this book and if you actually read it and not only look at the pictures you may find this to be true for you as well. For the price it is definately worth it."
3,It's all about Hedy,"Okay, so it's not the greatest flick, but it's interesting for two main reasons: 1) It has some serious racial overtones in that the Hedy character is supposedly not good enough to marry a white man (according to the Pidgeon character), so watching that play out is interesting and 2) Hedy Lamarr is very gorgeous in the role, with her skin color darkened to look like someone who's been kissed by the sun for years. My only complaint about her character is that she's played as some gold-digging simpleton who wants nothing but beads and baubles, instead of a more complex character in love with and trying to manipulate the Pidgeon character. The movie would have been much more interesting if they had played out the obvious physical attraction between Hedy and Pidgeon, with him realizing his love for her, despite her race, instead of his bullying her and trying to protect the white guy who married her. Also watch for the scene with Hedy traipsing about with whip in hand--PRICELESS!"
3,West Africa circa 1942,"The setting is a West African rubber plantation circa 1942. The war has cut off the rubber supply from Malaya, and there is a push to produce more on West African plantations. That is easier said than done. There are four white men on the station, the overseer, his assistant, the surgeon, and the missionary. Intercourse with native women is discouraged. A river boat brings supplies and mail up the river once every three months. They are otherwise cut off from civilization, and easily get on each other's nerves.The film was notable for Hedy Lamarr playing a half-wild, half-native vamp who wants men to buy her pretty things. She had enticed the overseer at some time in the past and he has banned her from the station. Now she is sneaking back to seduce his new assistant.It is not a great motion picture, as such things go, but it is an interesting story The scenes are somewhat tame by modern standards - nothing sexually explicit in motion pictures of that era."
2,White Cargo Doesn't Deliver,"Let's be honest: this is not a good film. Hedy Lamar is beautiful as ever and great at slinking and pouting around the tropical set. But, unfortunately for Hedy and for Walter Pidgeon, none of the characters or the plot are complex or compelling. Hedy's character is banal and evil. The young Brit is just an unsympathetic fool. Walter Pidgeon is given a little more to work with, but it doesn't save the film. The film is worth seeing, by the way, for the vision of Hedy in skin-revealing attire. Just don't pay much for the privilege."
2,A Collection of Old Sexual and Racial Sterotypes,"""White Cargo"" is a controversial 1942 hit that remains one of Heddy Lamarr's most popular movies. Set in 1910 Congo, Lamarr plays Tondelayo, a half-Egyptian, half-Arab temptress who seduces and antagonizes the white leadership of a British rubber plantation. At the time of its release, ""White Cargo"" conflicted with the Motion Picture Production Code's ban on miscegenation and filmmakers changed Todelayo's ethnic identity from black African in order to avoid code violations. Today, the film plays like a collection of old racial and sexual tropes that have long fallen out of favor and are often offensive to contemporary audiences. Tondelayo is not a well-developed character, but an erotic superficial cut-out whose exotic sexual power drives men to their ruin. Ultimately, ""White Cargo"" is a film about forbidden sex."
2,"beyond shock, this is disgusting art house cinema as its most excessive","I wish I could find something positive to say about this film, because I will be labelled ineffably square if I didn't like it, but I am afraid that I cannot recommend this to anyone but the fanatic art house crowd. This is the kind of thing we saw in high school to prove we were cool, a license to adolescent snobbism.Is there a message? Is it just absurdist anarchism? Are we supposed to want to disrespect all order? You got me. Masquerading as avant garde, you get scatological re-birth, rape, any bodily function associated with dirt or sex mixed, basically. You get screams about about capitalism, show biz, communism, etc. It is simply bizarre and I did not care to seek deeper meanings. I did not enjoy any of this either, saw nothing redeeming in it."
1,"wow, that really sucked.","first, a little about me. i love things that are weird, original, creative, sexually explicit, subversive, and substantive.i was led to believe (from other amazon reviews) that Sweet Movie was worth seeing, if not owning. well, i bought it and was completely bored and unsatisfied. sure, there were a couple neat subtleties in that hour and a half, but mostly it was vague, nonsensical twaddle (with annoying singing)!why this is a Criterion Collection film, i have no idea. i own a number of Criterion movies and really enjoy them, but this is extremely crappy.Darrick"
1,Not what it seems,"This movie is not as great or as shocking as billed. Apart from that, the movie really suffers from being poorly edited. It is hard to follow what's going on."
4,Thoughtfully Political Arthouse Film,"Sweet Movie, though obviously not for everyone, is perfect for study by those who wish to see how some choose to voice protests against established governments. Sweet Movie's political tone is sometimes shaded by overt displays of nudity, grossness and comedy, but pushing past all that you can see someone who loves his country, while hating aspects of it's ruling class. Watch this movie with an open mind to what it is trying to say. Don't just look at what's on the screen.Personally I enjoy Sweet Movie for it's over-the-top-ness. I enjoy the exploitation tactics used by the director to illustrate his points. If you cannot stomach outrageous displays, then stay away from this movie. If you are ready for an intense visual/insightful experience, please watch this in all haste."
3,Saturday Nite Live Uncensored,"Funny to an extreme! This film could be called shocking but when I watched it, I laughed so hard I nearly fell over. All I could do is imagine them making this movie on site and the fun and problems that must have arisen when filming began. It's incredible. This film shows you what living under a politically opressed regime can bring out of its film-makers. I specifically remember the wedding banquet scene. You'll have to see it to understand why."
1,huh ?????,I'm not sure what the people who reviewed this movie before me saw but watching this was just 90 min or so of my life that I will never get backIt is a total waste on every levelDo yourself a favor. Instead of watching this just go hit your head against a wall. It will take less time to get the same results
4,An enjoyable read,"this was one of those ""feel good, chick books"". Amazingly, my attentions was immediately captured and I spent an enjoyable Sunday afternoon reading it through. The characters are intelligently crafted and are highly believable almost. But that is what makes the story interesting. Highly recommended."
3,Can a city girl go home again?,"Jill Strahern returns to her hometown down on her luck and facing divorce from her husband who cheated on her and stole her law partner promotion. She moves in with her aunt to lick her wounds and take over the local law practice while sending out resumes to find another job with a larger firm in any city but Los Lobos. Her hunky childhood crush, Mac Kendrick, just happens to live next door with his daughter who he is estranged from due to his divorce. While trying to show his daughter how much he cares and that he made a mistake in not keeping in touch with her he has to juggle his duties as police chief and protecting the citizens and fighting crime. He and Jill cross paths both professionally and as neighbors and an old misunderstanding is talked out and they admit they are attracted to each other. Mac and Jill start an affair and she tries not to lose her heart since she doesn't want to stay in her hometown for good."
3,"Sweet Romance, Lacks Conflict","This book is a ""reunion romance."" All the genre conventions are represented. Big city lawyer moves back home to small town which she hates (for some reason which is never fully explained). Meets up with guy she had a crush on back in the old days. He's gone from sexy bad boy to sexy Sheriff. He has a troubled daughter who connects immediately with heroine and her aunt.The physical attraction between Jill and Mac is immediate. They can't actually get together right away because they have nowhere to go given that Jill is staying with her aunt and Mac's daughter is staying in his house, but they admit that they'd like to pretty much right away.What's left at that point is some antics, some small disagreements, and some external conflicts that need to be worked out. There's nothing in the romance itself that is problematic, which made this ultimately unsatisfying for me. It wasn't bad, it just wasn't very good, either."
4,"A quirky, fun romance!","Susan Mallery is a veteran author of women's fiction and she definitely knows what she's doing. SOMEONE LIKE YOU is lighthearted and fun when, given the subject matter, two broken hearted people with an ouchy past, the book could have been a total downer.Quirky characters, a wonderfully described setting, and descriptive emotions all work to pull you into the story.If you're a romance reader, you can't go wrong with a Susan Mallery book, SOMEONE LIKE YOU is a prime example of that."
4,Nice romance in a small town,"Very likable characters in a great small town setting. Like most small towns, the past is always present and influences the characters and situations. The secondary characters are generally as realistic as the leads. The story moves at a good pace and contains the emotional content to move it past average. I wasn't crazy about the outcome of one of the relationships; to me, it seemed out of character. That was the main reason for the 4 stars; it sounded a sour note in an otherwise very enjoyable read."
2,Not my favorite of her work,"Jill Strathern is an attorney who catches her husband doing the nasty in his office. She is fired from the firm and heads home to lick her wounds and take over a small town practice.Mac Kendrick has taken over as sheriff in the small town of Los Lobos. He and Jill went to high school together, where he rejected her. She still is attracted to him, but he has a child and other baggage to deal with.Along with the usual love story there is also a mafia-type ""uncle"" dating Jill's aunt and driving Mac crazy as he attempts to take over the small town.I didn't really like this as much as I have her other works. I somehow missed this back in 2004 when it was published and that was probably a good thing."
3,Good Theory .. but,"The book has a solid theoretical explanation of most of the popular graph drawing algorithms. So, if you want an explanation of these algorithms from a mathematical point of view, this book is for you.If you are like me, and want to approach these problems from an 'algorithmic' viewpoint. I.e I want to know how to write planarization, Orthogonal layout algorithms... This book will disappoint you big time...Most of the algorithms are presented in a mathematical form (not a psuedocode form).. It is a huge leap to convert algorithms in this book to code.Overall, I rate this book a 3 because, it is the ONLY book on this subject. Therefore, I cant compare it with anything else.My advice is :- math major = BUY, computer major = PASS, after all this book is not cheap -"
4,"Graph drawing, 1st edition","Worth reading, if a little dated now. These guys all know their stuff, as one would expect from such distinguished writers in the field. Can't wait for the second edition."
1,Who is this book for?,"I am a mathematician/computer scientist quite interested in the subject matter, but the book is almost useless, since it mostly discusses ad hoc methods, and avoids proving any of the actual theorems in the subject. Unfortunate, since there is certainly room for a good book on the subject."
2,child sized necklace,"While this necklace is pretty, it is very small and delicate and much more suited to a child than an adult. This is difficult to see in the online pictures."
2,Bore-city! Another Vol. 2 that does not come close to Vol. 1,"I agree with the reviewer (Scott Woods) below. When I saw this I scooped it up without question because I absolutely love Man Ray (the first volume) so much. The only two songs that are any good at all are songs that I already own: Baby (Koop) and Harmony (AtJazz). The other songs are so forgettable ... well, they are nondescript. I highly recommended Man Ray, Vol.1 but skip this unless you need some nice background music for your dentist's office."
2,How'd they do that?!,"How do you take a compilation of so many great artists (Nitin Sawhney, Atjazz, 4hero, et al.) and make a consistently BAD compilation? It's almost as if the DJs (3 in this case) were trying to out ""left-field"" each other, digging a little bit harder and harder for a track that may not have hit people's radars, but without regard for whether or not the track was actually any good.Every artist has a bad track or two in their ctaalogue. These guys managed to find the most boring, TOO laid-back, meandering tracks from them all."
4,Liza's England -- waking up memories for a fellow Brit.,"Liza's England is a wake up for someone who grew up in England. I enjoyed it so much that I sent it, and another book, to a friend who lives in Texas but whom was at school with me in England in the '50s. It reminded me of things that my grandmother had told me about, but also later in the 50s, 60s, 70s and so on. For people who have an interest in the time period and/or happenings in Britain, pre and post war, it is an enjoyable read."
1,Misleading cover,"When I first saw this book I fell in love with the blue armoire on the cover which reminded me of the unpainted armoire I have at home. I bought the book only to find the armoire was depicted twice (on the cover and page 82 - which is a full page picture)and there is a very brief paragraph that vaguely describes how Debbie "" . . broke every rule. ."" and used "" . . two different techniques . . ."" for this piece of furniture. Don't judge this book by it's cover."
3,Dabbie Travis' Weekend Projects,"I usually order used books on amazon, and I scored a bunch of them the other week after i got my taxes doen for a penny each.This book is exciting to receive, although after thumbing through it several times, I think the projects are really neat, just not a lot of them and doesn't really leave for very much creativity other than exactly what she did with the project. It's cool and I'll probably make some of the projects, but could possibly be better if used more as an outlet for creativity instead of an outline."
3,The movie is not the book!,"Not the original, but a kinder version I think than the original. I am not a Dr. fan--orfered for book group."
2,Cash in,"They needed to release a storybook of the movie for two reasons. One was that the movie plot bears such little resemblance to the original classic book ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas"" by Dr. Seuss that a different book was in order. The other was to make another buck and add to the millions they already spent and recouped on this entire Grinch project. I can only say that the movie is a corrupted failure that shouldn't presume to call itself the Grinch, and any book based directly on the movie is just as silly (and extremely bizarre; young kids might be frightened by these photographs.)"
2,I'm in this!,"Hey, I don't know if this book is good or not, but it's got a story by me in it, and even though I've read it lots, and wrote the damn thing, I still think it's pretty cool. It's about the end of the world. Wicked!"
3,Didn't work.,"I played the game years ago on the original Playstation. Now the only console I have that can play this game is the N64, so I bought this game online. It would not play at all. I would try to replace it or get my money back, but I'm unsure how."
1,horrible,"This game sucks ass. period. The new vehicles are ok sometimes, but all are slow and horrible to control. The new powerups are retarded , such as skis to go over water but at an even slower pace by 5 times. The old vehicles, and kooky characters are all gone, as is the storyline and anything else fun from the original. Oh, by the way, this was also made by a different company, which is the reason for all this horribleness. So , in summation, stick to the first on e til they come out with a 3rd one on a new system."
5,Vigilante 8: Scecond Offense Rules!,"This game will prove to be incredible! I have played Twisted Metal, and it stinks compared to Vigilante 8 and Vigilante 8: Second Offense. Twisted Metal is hard to play and is very dumb and childish. I think Vigilante 8: Second Offense will be a great game, and if you've ever played the original, you will love it. If you are considering an auto combat game, buy Vigilante 8: Second Offense."
4,One of the best spider-man books in a while!,"This is a good book everyone should read. The book has a great plot to it, and is full of action. Carnage was cold and vicious like he always is in the comic books as well as the books. Spider-man was also great like always is in most the books. It was all around a good book that I enjoyed reading, but the thing it lacked was description which I think is a key element for writing a good novel. Other then that I think that this book deserves a 4 star rating. I think that David Michelinie and Dean Wesley Smith are pretty good at writing the spidey novels and I look froward to reading another one."
3,Nothing too earth shattering but still fun reading,"A very well written book. The characters were believable. Spidey has his hands full with Carnage. Carnage is actually a super-villain in many respects. All he cares about is chaos. He kills without a thought. Not your normal villain looking for riches or world domination. Being a serial murderer makes the character a bit edgier. More of a challenge for Spider-Man in my opinion. The ending is a little soft. The question begs asking though, ""why didn't Spidey take care of the serum himself?"""
2,Fragile!,I had some different Libbey glasses that have lastest for almost a year and a half in a restaurant. These new ones are fragile even for home use. They are very pretty though!
5,Best Glasses Ever,I Love These Glasses They Are Thick So They Won't Break So Easy And They Are Also A Very Good Size
3,Heavy Base Tumblers,"Although the glasses are excellent- the packaging of the product is absolutely horrible!! I had two broken glasses and also cut myself in the process.I would have given the product 5 stars, but the packaging of the product is just horrible."
3,Nice Rim but very heavy,If you are looking for a nice not too thick rim on a set of glasses these are good for every day. The down side is they are really heavy at the base.
4,Good set of glasses for the price,"I picked these up at the local bed bath store about 6 months ago. They are a very good set of glasses for the price. Looks great at the table and holds a variety of beverages elegantly. Very thick, heavy, sturdy glass. They've been washed mostly by hand, but also put in dishwasher with no problems. If you have small hands like me, one thing to be wary of is the wide diameter of the smaller glasses - when my hands are slippery with dishsoap, due the width of the glasses, I find it difficult to grasp tightly for washing. If you have larger hands or mostly use the dishwasher, this should not be a problem for you. Note that there are no problems with drinking out of them (hands not slippery), and also no problems with handwashing the larger glasses (they are not as wide). Other than the minor issue with the smaller glasses, I am very pleased with the entire set."
1,Very easy to break,"I purchased two sets of these glasses. They break incredibly easy. They break when tipped over, in the dishwasher, etc. My son had one break in his hand when a light-weight plastic tuperware fell out of the cabinet and hit the glass.We have maybe two-thirds of the sets left, we're tossing them for safety reasons. We purchased them 3 months ago.Poor product."
2,arrived broken/damaged,"disappointed with these glasses. while they some arrived sturdy and strong the rest of the glasses were broken into pieces. im a little upset about sending these back and having to pay the return cost, especially since i wasnt responsible for the damage. lesson learned: only buy glasses at the store!"
2,Broken Glasses,"These glasses were looked great and were very heavy upon arrival, but one or two of them were broken, so now I have a partial set of great looking heavey glasses. I wanted to send them back, but shipping for return would have cost almost as much as the glasses cost me originally. I gave two stars, because the glasses were great but unusable. I would not suggest purchasing these online. If you can find them in a store, then they would be great."
5,great glassware!,"I bought this set for my boyfriend for XMas. It is so sturdy and very nice-looking! I would recommend it to anyone who wants a clean, but sturdy glass set"
4,Cheers to Prime membership!,"This exact item was listed on my niece's bridal registry at one of the popular ""Super"" stores. Anyway, I was ready to complete my order online with her super store registry, when the thought crossed my mind to check if the item was available at Amazon.com, and sure enough, it was! Although, I was surprised that the there wasn't a price break in the merchandise, I was relieved that my Prime membership -once again- saved me a bundle on shipping. I would have had to pay about $10 for shipping if I completed my order with my niece's registry. My niece sent me a thank you card, and claims to be pleased with the set."
4,Inexpensive but sturdy,"I have not had a problem with the glasses being fragile as some others have mentioned. I usually purchase from Crate & Barrel, but I will become a stay at home mom in a couple months, so I scaled back purchase prices on needed items. These fit the bill and are a high enough quality that I do not regret not ordering from my usual companies."
5,Durable & Contemporary,"These glasses are thick, durable, and were packaged perfectly for shipping. The price can't be beat!"
2,Handle with care,"Received these glasses from our wedding registry. We choose them because we have children and thought the heavy base would be best to prevent tip overs. During the first year we had been using these glasses, we broke all but 4 (and I'm not holding out hope they will last another 6 months). The glass only needs to be gently tipped over or knocked against another item in the dishwasher and it is cracked or broken."
2,Fragile,"I've broken two of these glasses in less than a month, most recently tonight when I picked up the larger glass full of milk and the entire bottom fell out. The glass I broke previously didn't take much effort either. Be careful with these glasses -- they may look like a substantial glass, but they're very delicate."
2,Break Easily,"These are nice looking glasses, but they break fairly easily. We've had these glasses for 3-4 months, and in that time about 5 of the tall glasses have broken. They have either broken while being washed by slight banging against other dishes or by being tipped, etc. We have other glasses that have lasted us forever. These just seem to not be durable at all. Especially not recrommended for use with children. We very very rarely use the 8 small glasses. They just take up space."
3,Great for awhile but dangerous,"I bought this set on September 11, 2008, and my family has really enjoyed it, especially the taller glasses. But in the last week two of the tall glasses have broken in the dishwasher, and today I was about to use a glass when a family member noticed it was cracked and potentially dangerous. I'm going to get rid of all of them, I can't take the risk of hurting myself. Maybe I had a bad batch or something, I'm going to contact the manufacturer."
3,Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2006,I have had trouble with the game having pauses in the action. Sometimes the shot are hestitant and makes the screen jump. I have been with EA Sports support services and they have made serveral suggestions but some I was afraid to use because it might hurt my PC.
4,More difficult for novices than previous versions,"You have a lot more choices for customizing your player than in previous versions of Tiger Woods PGA.But unfortunately less choices of courses than in 2003 edition for instance.And above all, if you choose Tiger as a competitor against you in a stroke match, he will vivisect you as you have chosen the novice option !It was far easier for me to make long drives in older editions.But maybe I have not yet mastered all the game. If I succeed in getting better results, I will let it know to Amazon customers."
3,challenging,"I had the 04 version, and this is more challenging than it was. I enjoy it, despite the fact that it has some graphic flaws and audio is sometimes slow."
4,Lots of Fun,"I purchased this game a month ago on Amazon and have thoroughly enjoyed playing it. There are many playing levels and game options, the graphics are great and the natural backround sounds really add to the realism of the game. At about 1/2 the price of the 2007 version of the game, it's a real bargain at under $10. I was able to convert the course disc to a vertual disc on my PC hard drive using Alcohol 52%, which allows the game to run a little faster and is much more convenient than having to run the course disc from the CD/DVD drive.The only negatives are that the commentary from Gary McCod and David Faherty isn't always in sync with the shot that was hit and it would be nice to have some additional ""name"" courses included."
5,Great Game,"Love the game. I use it on my laptop when I am traveling. I like it because it does not require a joystick, and it is cheaper than a PS2 game, etc."
4,Even for golf haters,"I do not play golf, or waste time watching it on TV. As an owner of an Xbox and a PC, I do recognize the quality of the Tiger Woods series. I've bought it a couple of times before. Between the eye candy and the ease of gameplay with just a mouse, Tiger Woods 06 is a game you must have. If you are a golf fan, don't buy this game expecting every course and every major name on the tour. Casual fans and gamers will be satisfied with what EA has included."
1,Never got it to work.............,"Piece of sh-t........... Stinkin thing, I spent 62.00 on a spankin new Video card and the thing never ran, spent hours with ATI Radeon's support and EA support, they were helpless."
1,Horrible!!,"This is by far the worst game I've seen. My machine is set up for gaming. I have plenty of memory and a great graphics card. But this game locks me up every time. It's slow, it drags...it basically stinks!! DO NOT PURCHASE THIS GAME! Once again, the game designers tried to get too ""cute"" instead of making a game that is playable. Can you tell I'm bummed out about it?"
1,Not worth the money,"This game is not user friendly. It allows you to create your own person, but when you play a game, it won't allow you to play the game again after you have finished all of the holes. The PS2 version is worth the money."
1,frustration,cannot load this game on either of two laptops and don't know why. Cannot rate a game that won't load.
1,Can't play cause if doesn't work,If this game would run on my Dell ocmputer ( Windows XP) I might enjoy. But I can not get program to load on ANY of my computers. I won't be buying Tiger Woods 2007!!!
2,Full of bugs that really drags down the game,"It could be fun, but it's just full of bugs, people disappear, it lags, sounds are delayed, it runs very slowly, screen loadups are slow, inconsistent chip shots. Today I tweaked options for peak performance, and the game won't even run, seems to work best on default mode. No patch is issued yet. So while it could be loads of fun its pretty much frustration and pain."
2,Not as good as 2004 or 2005,"A real letdown having used 2004 and 20052006 has all the same characters standing around the green like zombies. I once counted 5 of the same person.Unlike the other years EA sports hasn't come out with a NO cd patch which means the CD takes up your drive all the time if you play a lot.Hit with a 3w and watch the irons swing.No sick of hearing, ""That was an incredible shot"" Same retoric as the previous years. If you have 2005 play it and enjoy."
2,Not the best out there,"I've been running SuSE 7.1 for the past couple of months and it's been great!! So I decided to give RH 7.1 a go (since it's supposed to be one of the best/most used distributions out there). I was very dissapointed. To start Gnome's file manager kept respawning itself, programs run under certain logins and cause segmentation faults under others (these include programs that come standard with the distribution), and since I'm a Java developer what really got me was that you need to go through a whole work-around just to get Java to work!!I'm sticking to SuSE and would advise everybody to do so. This release just doesn't cut it - don't buy it!"
1,It is 10 years old... forget it...,"It is very old. It doesn't support any modern hardware. Get Fedora 13 instead. Fedora 13, 4-disks DVD Set, Includes ""Introduction to Linux"" video-DVD, Linux Training Library and printed Quick Reference Card of Linux commands, Contains both 32-bit and 64-bit versions, includes Complimentary Evaluation Exam by UNIX Academy"
1,Linux 7.1 Upgrade,"I have installed 3 different versions of RedHat, 2 of Mandrake, 1 of Caldera. Linux 7.1 is (IMHO) a disaster. It is somewhere between 50-80% bigger than 7.0 for the same modules. It refuses to upgrade a 1.1 GB 7.0 setup into a 2GB partition. Giving it 3GB and doing a complete install results in an unrecognized 3C509 card, no documentation about the network configuration utility, and a generally non-functional system. What it does do seems to run slower than 7.0. Tomorrow I start on my 2nd week of trying to get this thing to work. (Stick with 7.0 :=(( )"
4,Not much more than the downloads...,"If you have a good broadband connection, download the ISO's and burn your own. That's pretty much all this is. The documentation is minimal at best with quite a bit of advertising, easily replaced by third party books you would be wiser to spend your money on than this.So why did I buy it? Because I couldn't get my downloads to work right until after I'd already given up and ordered it. Murphy's law of downloads :-D..."
4,Good for beginning dancers and good review for advanced ones,"The tape is very easy to learn from for someone that has never danced tango before. The instructor and follower shows the steps alone and together.(which I found is easier for beginners to learn from) It is a very good but slow review for more advanced dancer. There is some ""flashy"" steps at the end that can spice up the basic moves that are shown at the first half of the tape. The very beginning shows a dance routine to demonstrate what can be done with a Tango even though the more flashy steps are not taught in the video. Which is disapponting for the more advanced dancer but one can review the tape and disect the steps. I don't recommended this for someone that has no patients. Over all it is a very good tape for beginners but a little slow for more advanced. I give it 4 stars for beginners and as a review for advanced dancers."
1,Impossible to learn in minutes,"The title of this videos says ""learn to dance in minutes - tango passion"". Not a chance. You can't learn to dance real Tango in minutes. Besides, this video teaches ballroom tango, which is not real tango. Real tango is Argentinean tango, and it takes months to learn to dance it properly."
4,Loving Cabritoville,"Life in Cabritoville, USA had me rolling! I truly enjoyed reading the antics of La Tere and La Wirms. Being a Chicana and being raised in Texas I can relate to many of the characters having known and lived with them. The obsession with Pedro Infante and his life shows the HIGH drama of the Mexican culture and all our complicated lives. La Tere was searching for her Pedro Infante sadly, she in some way found him in Lucio. Lucio is the dogs of dogs and she just keeps giving it all to him! Her character is vibrant and ""Puro Mejicana"". How many of us have known or even been La Tere at some point in our lives. I would have liked to have seen more of Ubaldo and his dissappearance leaves you wondering. This is the first Denise chavez writings I have read and it has me searching for more."
5,This book is for my mother in-law to read about pedro infante.,I got this book for my mother in-law because she is die hard fan of pedro infante. He was a great movie star and a great singer. He will always be a great movie star and a great singer. He has great movies and he sings good. I grow up watching he's movies to because my uncle always had it on on tv. And i to became a fan of he's to. This is a great book to read on pedro infante it has alot information on him.

2,Breaks easily; too fragile,"This toy started to break shortly after taking it out of the box. Small parts (like the tow truck hook) break off easily with gentle/normal use. Our 4yr old got this for his birthday and LOVES to play with it, but knows he has to be extremely careful or it will break."
3,"Hitler myth, a review","While this was a worthwhile read, I thought the author repeated himself just a little too much. Sorta like trying to fill a page with words rather than thoughtful argument. Nothing really new here, but a little different slant on a very complex subject/"
1,Won't hold up.,"Sorry to say, I have replaced this product 4 times. Within a three month period the tiny wires get shorts in them and the audio is gone. I have been very disappointed in the sturdiness of this handsfree ear phone. Would not recommend this product."
4,Raising animals by the Moon,This was a Christmas gift for my son-in-law.I'm not sure if he finds it useful or not.
4,Came In Handy,The product fit my tub and came in very handy for my mother who recently had a stroke and needed the assistance of a chair in the shower.
2,Disappointed,"OK product. I needed it right away for my mom, and was pleased that it came quickly. But when I opened the box, the bench that I received was not what was pictured. I would have returned it, but I couldn't wait until I received a new one, so I was forced to keep it. It's OK, but I would prefer the one pictured. It appears smoother, without seams and holes. My mom has extremely sensitive skin, and the smoother bench would be better for her. Disappointed that it wasn't what was pictured."
1,Attempting to assemble the Medine Transfer Bench,"It may have been only the item sent to me but I gave up and sent the item back because I could not put it together without forcing, bending and possibly breaking the item. There were at least 2 places where a long bolt needed to go through 4 holes. Once one bolt was secured (through all 4 holes, I could only get the other bolt through 3 but not the 4th hole. They did not line up properly. I tried using different pieces of hardware in different places to no avail. After spending more time than I should have had to, I decided not to risk breaking the item and sent it back."
2,Remember Hungry Hungry Hippos,"The kids played it once. That's it. Really not much fun for them. No educational value unless you use the marbles that come with it for counting games. My five year old, is not as coordinated as my eleven year old and was a little frustrated playing this game. The eleven year old thought it was boring even though he's a huge Pokemon fan."
2,Broke Christmas morning,"My twins were thrilled to open this on Christmas morning; it was the first toy they wanted to play with. However, it was broken in just minutes. Really. They were not being too rough with it. It was just not well made.It was worth the $6 I paid for the marbles. I'll give it two stars for that."
1,Maybe I'm just no good at pilates,"Maybe I'm just no good at pilates, but about every other time I tried to use it, I hurt myself. Maybe I'm just way too out of shape or something. I'm not really heavy, but I have like no muscle. So maybe if you're in better shape than I was it would be helpful, but for it wasn't. Honestly I tried a dozen times, gave up, and switched to yoga."
5,One of my FAVORITES.,"I love this Pilates DVD. It's amazing. Every section is intense and interesting because a lot of the exercises are new/different to me.Someone was complaining that the arm section was stupidly easy, but it wasn't for me, but then my arms are kind of the weakest muscle group I have, so who knows. I first tried using three pound hand weights, but that was much too hard, so I ended up using full bottles of water (which equals one pound a piece) because I don't have one pound hand weights and that worked perfect.I really enjoy all the sections, but my favorites so far are the abs and legs and thighs.The stretching section is great too, but she does forget to stretch the arms."
4,Effective!,"I really enjoy this DVD it's very intense, in the best way. My thighs were burning throughout the lower body circuit, the ab section is surprisingly intense also. It's good and the 10-minute sessions make it very do-able and less intimidating. I love having the option to mix and match the workouts as well."
5,Great Workout!,"I really enjoyed this DVD, great instructor and and a workout. It really works all the area of the body and super effective, you will feel yourself transforming into a pilate perfect body. I highly recommend this workout."
4,Moving Up,"I was doing the 10 Minute Solution Rapid Results Pilates video which was incredibly challenging at first, but because boring and routine after a while. This DVD is a great step up and definitely gets a lot of work done in a short amount of time. As far as the instruction goes, my only complaint is that some of the positions hurt my wrists.The DVD setup is great because you custom pick which of the five workouts will play and in what order. I think it would be great if the music were optional because sometimes I'd like to turn up the TV and hear the instructors voice over my own music. That way it would take a lot longer to get old."
3,Just okay.,"Maybe it is because I'm used to Ana Caban pilates, but this was not very challenging to me. Each segment works fine, but most of the positions she does are foreign to me and not too difficult. I can feel the burn in my arms the next day, but not in my abs. After 2 weeks of no notable change, I'm going to sell it."
3,10 min Pilates,I've only done it a couple of times but I was sore after each workout so it must be doing something right!
5,Great time saving workout,Works great for the single working mom. I love that it is broken up into 10 minute workouts so you can do all 5 if you have time or just 1 if you are short on time and you can also pick the area you most want to work on!
4,Great 10 min. sections,The workout is more intense than some of the other 10 min. solutions videos. very good for the abs and arms.
2,bbarbosa,"I am trying to get back in shape. I am close to my goal. I have lost 30lbs going to gym and doing cardio but I needed a seperate exercise for muscle toning. I bought this dvd a few weeks ago and finally started using it about 2x/wk in the last three weeks and I am very impressed with this dvd. The instructor is very charismatic and to the point with directions. The exercises are challenging but addictive; I can't stop with the first segment. I feel empowered when I'm done. I could already see my muscles toning up. I also notice that my posture has improved without trying. I also bought the other pilates dvd by ana caban, the beginners mat workout but I definetly prefer the 10 minute solution. It is more challenging and trains the entire body. A+++++ for this one."
4,Great workout!,"I travel a lot so I do not get to go to my regular pilates class. I like this video because it is comprehensive. But I do supplement a warm-up myself with moves I know from other classes. With my own addition, I think this DVD is great! And I really love the stretching at the end!"
3,I LIKE IT...,"Honestly the only parts of this video I liked were the ab and arm workout. Everything else was too easy for me. I wasn't sore at all. I guess I'm used to working out my legs and butt a lot more than this! Since I never work out my abs or arms this definitely worked for me. If you exercise every part of your body very frequently, I suggest you look into other videos, something harder!"
3,this dvd is just ok.,"I got this dvd to do some pilates post pregnancy. I do like the set up of 10 min increments so that you can choose your workout and spend as little or as much time as you want. However, the teacher goes a little bit fast and so it's hard to initially keep up with her but it's important to get the posture right in order to get the benefits. I got a pregnancy pilates dvd similar to this one before and liked it much more. The teacher was different. Some of these exercises are also too difficult for me and she does not really provide a good alternative (a step down to start you off before you can do the really hard poses)."
4,Works as advertised,Inexpensive and easy to install.. May help to prevent $$$$$$$$$$ in water damages. How could it hurt?
4,untitled,"This type of detector is most effective when used in basements, storm cellars and crawlspaces that are prone to floodingduring heavy rain or snowmelt."
2,Battery leads come apart,"This water alarm works, but after I had replaced the 9-volt battery maybe four times over the course of several years, the lead that grabs the battery terminal just ripped off. I was very careful when removing the battery (because of the design of the battery interface), but it didn't help. Seems like all the work that was put into the design of this product, was wasted by selection of a cheap component during manufacturing. ""For want of a nail ...."""
5,Another amazing book in the Culinaria series,I find this book more as a geographical guide to the caribbean then as a culinary guide. It's amazing to see again and again all those beautiful landscapes.
1,This has nothing to do with robotics,"Wow, I was so hugely disappointed in this, I don't know where to begin. It is not a robot at all. It is a remote control car that you place a little taped together carboard piece on top of. You punch out the cardboard, tape it up (the tape doesn't hold, so we hot glued and it still didn't hold)and stick it on top of a premade remote control car. It has nothing to do with building a robot. It's more like folding a paper airplane. It was a joke! My son has just finished an electronics kit and wanted to move onto building a robot. I didn't think it was going to be a real live walking and talking robot - but I thought he'd learning something about putting a robot together. Not true. I would not recommend this to anyone - unless you're looking for a remote control car (and in that case spend your money on a better one somewhere else). My son was so excited about building a robot and was completely disappointed by this set. Don't waste your money!"
4,Teen Fic for Today,"Poor Franky has to deal with a near date rape, but it brings out a strong side of her known as ""Freaky Green Eyes"". Freaky seems to know the truth about what is going on, even though Franky doesn't say anything. Why her mother wears scarves and long sleeves, and eventually moves out. How it isn't right that bruises are left on her sister and herself after ""punishment"" by her father. It especially isn't right that after her mother's disapperance, her father was supposed to be home, but Freaky knows that his car had left the driveway late that night. It's up to her to make it right, despite the consequences.I highly recommend this book based on the excellent voices Joyce Carol Oates gives to her characters. It is truly unique to find an author who can write for both adults and teens, while still keeping her audience in mind."
4,A Feel Good Little Mystery,"This was a very nice little book with a good message. It reminds us of the importance of the truth. Ms. Oates does a very nice job in keeping the reader interested with her descriptive passages and colorful main character: Francesca Pierson. I enjoyed this book. It's not the best I've ever read, but I believe that I could read it a second time. It's a good young adult fiction, and I think it appeals more to girls since the story is told through a female's eyes. Her ""freaky green"" eyes."
4,Great Family Product / User Friendly,"We gambled on this Hitachi package because its description and photographs appeared to fit the FAMILY Vs. Unitied Artists FILMAKER category, seeking a ""User Friendly"" model. The gamble paid the following dividends. A CamCorder that is light, simple to operate without requiring the 3 eyed camera-person. 1 to film and 2 to consult the owners manual. This model comes with a lo light feature Vs. built in lights on other models. Our lo light filming in both indoor and outdoor settings proved positive with ""tru color"" imagery without the lamp glare that is common with the built ins. The Autofocus feature will require more attention, as it is very positive to the dead-center subject rule, especially involving indoor moving targets i.e. 5 year old grandsons. One feature not advertised was this CamCorder's 2.5"" Flip out screen: its COLOR! The camera bag is attractive and roomy. Tripod is ok, but its a lightweight model. We're Very Happy with our USER FRIENDLY HITACHI."
3,"offers good protect, but they are not ""cubes""","Used this for my Otterbox 1320, Had to do a bit of trimming though. The middle section is not comprised of ""cubes"" as the description states. They are more like french fries, long rectangular boxes. This was disappointing but they still do their job.Kinda pricey for just a little bit of foam"
1,I confirm,I confirm what ZeppelinDT wrote. Any non-numbered '96 Christmas CD is a counterfeit.Buyers beware!
5,great purchase!,"great, easy, inexpensive way for me, a handicapped person with multiple sclerosis,Medline Bathtub Bar, Locks to Side of Tubto safely get in and out of the bathroom."
5,fantastic,"this is probably the best 30.00 I ever spent. I fell and had surgery and needed help to take a shower. I bought this item and it's fantanstic, wonderful, easy to use and does the job."
4,Mixed feelings..,"I bought this for my mom along with those suction cup hand rails and it has came loose once. I will say she has glass doors and there is a 1/4"" in gap above the tub where the brass doors slide back and forth. I had to put this on top so it does not fit flush against the tub. If she had a shower curtain it will slide down more and fit better. I just wished they thought of that when making it."
4,Great aid for old tub,Perfect size for one who is having trouble getting in and out of an old bathtub. Easy to install and works as advertised for a great price.
5,Great gadget- for safety,"Got this for my dad who stayed with us after my mom passed away and was fearful of everything- including getting in and out of the tub. This gadget is so easy to install or move to a different location. My family was impressed with the strength. I am an Occupational Therapist and will recommend this for potential clients as well. Good quality and price.Also does not interfere with the rest of the families showeruse, hardly seen behind the showercurtain. Very pleased with this purchase"
5,pops on and off,"The tube bar went on right the first time and when I wanted to remove it to wash the dog, it was easy to get it off and back on. i wish I had gotton one sooner."
1,Did not fit on my tub,The previous reviews are correct. This does not fit on a 7 inch tub. The insert with the bar says 6 inches.It does appear to be a good product- very sturdy.It is heavy and I am not looking forward to how much it is going to cost to return it.
4,Us impaired people,This is a sturdy handle which attaches to a tub. It will assist individuals who are not as steady as they use to be. If you need it you should not do without it. it may possibly prevent a very serious fall which may cause serious medically problems. Recommend this product.
4,Bathtub Bar Review,"Product works very well, clamps to side of tub and is very stable. Price was right and the product works exactly as advertised."
4,Very Satisfied,"This bar would be useful to anyone who needs some support while getting in or out of the tub. It's a well made, sturdy piece. It's actually quite heavy.It's easy to install; basically it sits on the side of the tub like a saddle. Just position it, tighten the knob and you're set to go. Be sure to keep checking the knob to ensure that the unit is secure, as it has a tendency to loosen over time.I did have a problem with the internal non-skid pad, which kept sliding out of position. (It's the pad that is attached to the piece that holds the unit in position.) I was able to remedy this with some Permatex silicone."
3,Not for all tub styles,"Got this bathtub bar for an older tub - oops - it doesn't tighten far enough for that style. Since we needed it immediately, I kept it and put a block on the outside side of the tub to shim it. I'm not sure about the angle being perpendicular to the side of the tub but so far it is doing its job.There's not much else to say about it except that if you find that it doesn't tighten enough to not budge even a hair, return it. Ever so slightly loose and it will cause more damage than it prevents."
4,bathtub help,"I bought this for my 99 year old grandmother. Her bathtub is made strangely and it was difficult to find a place that it could actually be attached. And when I did find a place to attach it, it wasn't exactly where we wanted it ... BUT having said all of that... it works well. She now has stability while getting in and out of the bathtubThe equipment itself is very easy to attach - you just place it over the edge of the tub and then tighten it. My Grandmother's tub is a decorative one though and it was too wide for the bar to fit over the edge. Bit there was a place in the back of the tub where the decorative lip was smaller and I was able to attach it there"
4,Sturdy but check your tub,"I ordered this because it looked like the sturdiest product of its type and was not disappointed. It seems to be well made and when properly installed should support the weight suggested.However, the description doesn't indicate that the clamp won't hold if the sides of your tub aren't straight. The sides of my tub slant downward for about 6 inches before becoming vertical. As a result my husband could not find any way to tighten the clamp so it wouldn't slip.If you have a straight-sides club, this product should be great."
5,My mother loves it and feels secure,"Anchors easily, no assembly required. Gives very good assist points to the tub that could other wise be dangerous. Hope the plastic knob holds up, seems OK."
5,Hands down best.,"This is the best recording available of these historic works from the very dawn of the guitar in orchestral setting and a real fix for early-guitar nostalgists. Recorded versions of Giuliani's 1st concerto *unedited* are rare indeed; this is undoubtedly the one of that small set I would select to introduce the inquisitive to the complete work. I am surprised by the balance achieved by the period instruments (19th c. guitars aren't known for orchestra-defeating volume). I'm so surprised I suspect a little cheating via mic placement or amplification. Upon hearing the natural and acoustically pleasing results, any suspicions are gladly forgiven."
2,Overpriced and far from ideal,"If you are a true sushi fanatic, these will probably be incredibly disappointing for you. The rice is excellent, but the precut nori is dry and crunchy and cut too small to roll much more than a single piece of avocado. Save the money and buy your own mat. Wish I had!"
1,something bad happened here,"The salt had separated from the rice, or something weird happened to this product. The salt is just sitting on top and so the rice tastes wickedly terrible. Either the other folks here who enjoyed this product don't know what sushi is supposed to taste like, or my shipment got ruined enroute to me. I won't order this ever again."
5,I love Sushi!,"This is the best stuff ever! My attempts at sushi rice at home failed, never sticky, not seasoned right, etc.. This takes that step out, and with the just a few more things (california rolls-avacado,cucumber, crab) you have perfect sushi. The nori is also cut-up into easy to manage strips. The only thing that I thought was included, or at least should be, is a little spoon or paddle to scoop the rice."
3,A bit disappointed!,I had purchased these at Walmart before and loved them. But when I used the first one the rice was quite a bit dryer then the walmart purchase. I don't know whether since they were bought in bulk they sat in a warehouse or what happened. I probably won't purchase them this way again. Sorry.
5,Addicting and easy!!,"Love these wraps. They are a snap to make, even my kids can make them with no problems. They are very hard to find in the grocery stores so I am very glad Amazon sells them!!"
2,Very Disappointing,Although the product is very easy to use and the rice sticks together perfectly to make a sushi roll-----the rice is tasteless because it has neither mirin vinegar nor sugar nor salt in it (commonly called sushi vinegar)--------the nori wrappers are too small to make any decent sized roll and too thin to withstand any handling-------I have had better sushi rolls at the worst japanese restaurant---------the soy sauce is OK but without wasabi mustard you cannot achieve the taste of real sushi
4,Yummy ! if not actually sushi rice,Quite tasty! No flavorings in the rice but still a very nice light lunch. Can be a bit messy for those of us who are not skilled sushi roll wrappers. I have been making this a regular part of my pantry. My kids love it and it is easy to add seasoned vinegar if we want traditionally flavored sushi rice. The seaweed wrappers are small and occasionally have a few holes but are quite good. This company also sells small bowls of the sticky rice alone if you don't want the seaweed and soy sauce. both are great and very easy to prepare.
2,"No easier than regular sushi, just more packaging","I suppose if you're really on the go and feel like packing all your sushi innards and taking them to work is easy, this could be helpful... But the tiny seaweed paper trips were too small, and it really didn't feel like it was much easier than just doing regular sushi. There is a lot of packaging for all the little pieces.I can see how it could be fun for a bunch of little kids to make a mess, but not for two adults to sit down and have a meal together."
5,sushi addict... these are great!,I'm obsessed with sushi... LOVE it. These do-it-yourself wraps have that sushi flavor I need - and you can put whatever fillings you want inside. I made my own California rolls and they were amazing.
4,Delicious and Convenient,"My family loves sushi. These little kits seemed like a nifty solution to the problem of not having any sushi restaurants nearby. The rice, soy sauce and nori wrappers are all excellent quality and very tasty. The reason I cannot give this product five stars is due to the tiny nori sheet issue. The nori sheets you get with this kit are stupidly small. It's near impossible to make a decent roll with a single nori sheet. I have been 'gluing' a few nori sheets together with a little water on the edge of each sheet, width-wise, to create a better size roll. My whole family love this product, and will continue to use it. It's the easiest way I've found to make great tasting sushi without much fuss. I'd really love to see Annie Chun's come out with a sushi kit that has larger nori sheets, but until that happens this kit is a nice stop-gap for when you want a quick, fuss-free sushi snack."
5,Very easy,I am so glad I took a chance I buying this. It was super easy to make. Gret to have when you need that craving fixed bt do not want to spend big bucks to get it.
3,Anticipating reading this book...,"I haven't read this book yet but I plan to do so because I remember accompanying my mother to the Clinic in Tijuana when I was l3 years old. She was having problems with fibroid tumors. They gave her six months' worth of medicine and told her to come back after that time. She never did..she said she hated the taste of the medicine and her doctor told her the tumors would shrink of their own accord after menopause anyway, so she chose to live with the pain. However, she knows someone who is still alive and in her 70's now because of completing the herbal course they gave her. It cured her cancer. I'm looking forward to reading this book to fill in the gaps in my memory and to learn more about the clinic and the man behind them. (Since I haven't read the book yet I can't give it any stars, so my three-star designation isn't valid.)"
2,Natural medicine up against Big Pharma,"This book is very well written. It goes into plenty of details about the Hoxsey cancer clinic and it fight with the A.M.A, NCI, ACS, FDA to have the tonic tested and legalised in America. Really a good read.THIS BOOK GETS FIVE STARS I MADE A MISTAKE AND CAN'T REDO WHAT I CLICKED."
5,A Real Eye-opener,"Ausubel's book is a real eye-opener, not only of the alternative cancer treatments that are out there, but of the unfortunate way of business that perpetuates keeping them under wraps. So many people could be using viable treatments that don't harm in the way that radiation and chemo do, but organized medicine/pharmaceutical companies have too much to lose if the word gets out.This book should be a must read for anyone studying ""health"" care, politics, and ethics. Also, anyone faced with cancer in their life or the life of someone they care about."
4,Practical ideas built on thoughtful perspectives,"Sobel and Sheth have distilled a great deal of information into a few meaningful concepts with practical ideas for applying them. Professional relationships are full of complexity, whether it is with a client, boss, or subordinate. The authors have looked at the work of professional advisors throughout history, and identified the essential ingredients and dangers in client relationships. I liked the approach they take, stressing excellence, integrity, and continual learning as the foundation, and going further into looking at the essential need for independent judgement built on a solid understanding the businesses they advise. The framework they provide is not easy-- it's original and challenging to carry out. The book is well written-- it moves quickly, weaving real stories as context for the insights the authors provide. I think anyone who works in the professional services area will take a lot of ideas from this book that can be applied."
3,Interesting reading,"If you're looking for nutritional information on fruits and/or vegetables than this is NOT your book. The book does contain interesting information on the healing properties of myriad fruits and vegetables but most of it is based on anecdotal information (ie a ""friend"") although some studies are mentioned. However I do believe that the book does make an interesting read."
5,Heinerman New Ency Fruits&vegs Rev&expanded (Paperback),Heinerman is a genius. Using the knowledge in this book saved my life!!! If you want to live a long healthy life this book is a worthwhile investment.Get the book...Read it....It will change your life !!!God Bless !!!
3,some helpful hints,"There is some interesting knowledge here but using expensive and exotic vegetables to treat minor ailments seems irrational. Also, seeing an enema instruction next to a recipe is just plain gross."
2,its ok,well cant say its horrible but its not that great. My boy likes it for the most part but has only watched it 3 times. I would suggest skipping this one and go for any of the mighty machines they are the best ones in his and my opinion or the ones with hard hat harry even like lots and lots of trucks all of them are way better and we have watched all them countless times he never gets enough of those ones. This one isnt very exciting to him
4,easy to install and perfect fit,"Always wanted a 2"" Tach to fit into the original Holes in the dashboard of my 57 Chevy.I would have preferred the Mooneyes tach for it's look but since it is no longer available I finally ordered the Autometer tach.Quality is real nice (no cheap China s***)"
2,Required but bad,Absolutely reqired to get through the game but absolutely lousy. Screen shots (black&white) almost useless. Some of the reference text to a complex situation is wrong. Some of the comments are rather juvenile. There is no other choice but I'm sorry to see it go this way.
5,excuse me?!?!,"Firstly, this doll rox! secondly, I read the reviews, and one said ""Even though she has freckles, shes still beautiful,"" and I just wanna know, um...WHAT THE PLEASE-STAND-BY IS WRONG WITH FRECKLES!!!!!!!!! Lots of people have freckles! I have them, my Mom has them, two of my best friends have them! even celebrities have them-look at lindsay lohan!!!!! Thats all I have to say!"
1,I'd gag!,"If Mattel opened up a line of real fashion fever clothes, and i saw those ugly thangs in the mall, i'd gag! This entire line is really sucky, ugly clothes, and they all look to bloody same! Okay i'll admit, i'm abit of a punk, (dressing) so i don't really wear really gurly stuff, but still! what an ugly dumb retard doll! I HATE THIS DOLL. ME AND MY FRIENDS ALWAYS MAKE FUN OF BARBIE AND HER UGLY PINK DRESSES AND STUFF. IT'S REAL FUNNY, SHE HAS TO BE PERFECT ALL THE TIME. PEOPLE SHOULD STOP BUYING THESE DOLLS AND GET REAL FASHION DOLLS (YOU KNOW LIKE THE SWEET ONES YOU CAN GET IN JAPAN? NOW THOSE R HOT) BECAUSE BARBIE AND BRATZ ARE TOTALLY OUT.**PUNKSTAR**"
5,One of the best shows growing up!!!!!!!!!!!!,I grew up watching this show! and every time i watch it now i laugh as if it was my first time watching it again.Whoever doesn't have season 1&2 need s to go out and get it. And when the rest of the seasons come out on dvd get them too.One of the funniest parts on season 1 wasin the poetry cafe'Would you like something to drink? How about a CAP-U-CINO!HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH!Go out and get it
5,Boy Meets World: The Complete Third Season,Great packaging! Love the series! Bought it as gift and she also loved it! Loooking forward to buying the rest of the seasons.
5,Boy meets world,"This show is about ten years old, but it is hilarious!! It has ""real"" jokes instead of all that other stuff that they play ontelevision! It is great, and kid friendly!! :) :) (I am a kid!)"
4,BMW saved the best for last! Give us the best!,"The early seasons are okay but the really funny stuff came in the last couple of seasons. For those of us that already invested our money in building our BMW set, do the right thing and release the GOOD seasons we were waiting for all along! I only bought 1-3 assuming that I would be buying the better seasons as they became available. I've got to be honest; I feel short-changed. If you had released the seasons in reverse order, they'd probably have sold really well.The best of BMW was saved for last - please give it to us!"
4,one of my top 3 fav shows ever!!!!!!!!!,i just found out about 5 minutes ago that boy meets world season 3 was coming to dvd 8/23/05 and i can't wait.the day it comes out i will buy it.my # 2 fav show ever.
2,"Dream are Entertaining, But Irrelevant","Why would people spend their lives obsessing over issues for which there is no objective evidence? A cursory review of the literature about the mind will reveal that dreams are random and without predictive or any other kind of meaning. Certainly dreams can be about stressful situations in one's life, but they will be mixed with all sorts of extraneous things, people and events that have no significance...viewed properly, they can provide good light entertainment.Simply put, during consciousness the mind has an inhibition system that is activated so that cognition can proceed in an orderly fashion. During sleep this system is shut off and all bets are off. That's all there is to it! I am tempted to give this book a 1, but will give it a 2 because I don't think she's trying to be deceitful.For current info, see July '05 issue of the mag, ""Scientific American Mind."""
5,"Complete Dream Book, 2nd edition: Discover What Your Dreams Reveal about You and Your Life (Complete Dream Book)",Awesome purchase and quick delivery!!
1,Tom Cruise should read this,"If there was ever evidense that psychology is non-beneficial, it would be proved here in this book. I highly recommend reading other books on dream interpretation, Holloway's book is the absolute worst I have ever read. Nothing here is supported, the entire book is random, no train of thought, and the interpretations are absolutely vague and apply to any dream. Do not waste your time."
1,Not as complete as advertised,This book was definitely not as completed as advertised. It also is not from a Christian viewpoint and so it will not help much when trying to interpret a God-given dream with a Godly meaning.
3,NOT QUITE WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR,No book I've read on dreaming ever has sufficient information to interpret your own dreams. Seems that there are always things you've dreamt about that are not covered off in the dream dictionaries I've read.However - an OK read for the concept of the whys and hows
5,Dream book,Very good book. A lot of information in it. Easy to follow.Has been borrowed a few times from friends.
3,Limited detail,This book covers a multitude of cicumstances but is short on detail. All in all is informative and should satisfy most readers.
3,not the best not the worst,"My mom has a couple dream books that she likes and I thought I would get a different one for me. This book has a lot of information but not in as much of a simplified form as I would have liked. I have found that many of the dreams I have had are nowhere listed, no matter how hard I look...hmmmm maybe I'm just too wierd!! I think it is a good book for your Dreams book collection, but I will add others for future references."
5,Most accurate dream interpretations!,This book is based on real dreams correlated with events in the dreamers life- I have used many many dream interpretation books and this one has been SO SO accurate on its symbology and its messgae as it pertains to things going on in my life! SO GREAT!
1,Mundane Garden Variety Dream Book,"This book is terrible. It has all the common conventions of a Dream dictionary book. I would have to say that out of all the mundane, garden-variety dream books out there, this one rates in the top 5. Some of the older releases of these books are very racist! I find it interesting that if you dream of a black man or black person, that you will have bad luck (what bull$hit)!If you want a real Dream Dictionary, *HUNT* for ""The Dream Book"" or ""Dream Dictionary"" by Evad Aras. This is the best dream dictionary I have ever used in my life. The book is extremely rare and hard to find. This book features numerolgy interpretations and very accurate interpretations of dreams. Evad Eras's book is far more accurate than this book. I almost believe that Gillians book is a knock-off that's been dumbed-down!Another good book is the ""Gypsy Dream dictionary"" by Raymond Buckland. But *NO* book comes close to Evad Ara's books"
1,The Complete Dream Book had handwriting in it,"The Complete Dream Book was sold to me as a new book, but it turned out to be a used book and had a person's name written in it and even a personal note card that identified the owner as a prison inmate! I was not told that the book I ordered was a used book. I gave the book as a Xmas gift to my daughter, without opening it. It was awful that she discovered her gift was a used book and had writing in it and a prison note card! I'd send it back, but I didn't keep the wrapping and paperwork."
1,not what it states!!,"the description states quote "" Further Note: This auction is for a set of three (3) pickups. The pickguard is custom made to fit the slightly oversize alumitone pickups and is yours free when you order.""When I ordered them, I only received (1) pickup - and no custommade pickguard. I was told ""that's the way it is..."" This is falseadvertizing, and Amazon should have stood by thier product desciption,instead of blaming someone else, and claiming ignorance. I wanted thepickup set - not an exuse!"
5,A true guide from beginning to end,"The moment I opened the book, I knew I had come to the right place. I read all the tips and soon had I chance to use them during my first encounter with a woman....I can tell you without a doubt that haven't I read the book, I wouldn't have felt that confident in bed with my first woman partner. I felt very comfortable and safe because I had a world of information with me, a trusty source for someone who had no idea where to go and how to ask for advice. I really think sex should always be safe and I learnt to be safe and enjoy at the same time. A must read for coming out women and a great review for seasoned lesbians. Highly recommend it!"
2,Not the guide I was hoping for.,"Being a married man a looking to keep our relationship exciting, I was hoping for some insight into the complex ways of the female body. But instead of a guide to potential pleasure I received a pocket book guide of life-facts. Don't get me wrong, the information was very informative and I did learn, it is just not what I had expected to be reading. This is definitely a guide for women, not men."
4,FINALLY - An Artist with concepts!,"A friend of mine brought a copy of DA Chameleon and I asked to check it out. At first I did not know how I was going to be affected by a Hip Hop act coming out of Washington DC, because typically the only thing I hear coming out of DC is GO-GO. But being the Hip Hop affeciondo that I am, I listened without prejudice and bias. How pleased I was to hear a well thought out project, well written verses and concepts - again for you so called emcees - CONCEPTS! It was refreshing to hear things other than The Game, Cristal, What I got and how much I had to sling to get it, and my LEX....no pun intended! There are true artist's still left in this biz. Great effort."
4,"An excellent follow-up album to ""Temple Bar""","John Waite continues to be one of the BEST singer/songwriters that NOBODY knows! He has once again given us insight into his most private feelings. He shines throughout the album and proves ,once again, that he will continue to produce high quality albums to a loyal legion of fans. Keep rock'n JW!!"
5,John Waite an English man abroad,"Once again John comes up with some of the greatest lyrics that far to many people will never know such as ""the snow fell like cocaine"" on All I want for christmas. One day people will see and come to recgonise the genius he is. Tracks such as the title track ""when you were mine"" echo the warm summer days that he singss of while ""suicide life"" shows the dark desperate side of humanity today.A classic album and a must buy for all those who know and worship this almost uknown genius. Check this album out it's gotta be worth it"
2,Bulky and flimsy,"This case did not resolve my quest for a decent holster for my motorola v190. I love the phone, but the accessory market stinks.Pro: Finally a case that doesn't push the side buttons (which I can't disable)Cons: Broke (a little) within 24 hours of light use. Still barely usable. Very Bulky."
4,Die Winterreise,"Not everybody's cup of tea; very tragic Romanticism. Unless, of course, you like the immortal Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau."
5,Definitely a Favorite!,"Castle is one of those shows to which I always look forward. It is a rare combination of mystery, action, humor, and romance. This show has it all, and Rick Castle does steal the show, without fail. I am always laughing and absolutely glued to this one. I hope it runs for many seasons."
5,Catch up on missed shows,My wife and I both like CASTLE. We had been watching reruns on another channel and missed all of season 5 thru 12/31/12. So we downloaded these to catch up.
5,Castle Fan,I love anything Castle and and I think this is the best show on TV and I never miss it. I can hardly wait until September each year so I can purchase the new DVD of the previous season. Any Castle fan it is a must have.
5,Castle best show ever.,I love this show my favorite. Love all the actors and the writers must be great.I hope this show lasts for many more seasons.
5,Awesome.,Awesome series. I love it definitely my favorite show on tv. Such great acting and very engaging story lines. It's a show I can watch more than once and still enjoy. Would definitely buy it again
5,AWSOME EPISODE,Love this tv show and it was an awsome episode i cant wate for the next episode i just think this show is awsome
5,Great Series,If you liked Firefly you may like this. Nathan Fillion has several Firefly incerts you may catch a refrence of here and there. Some Overly Obvious
3,Castle Still Delivers,"When Castle first aired, it was fresh, funny, and fanciful (a novelist who brought his writer's imagination to the case). I would have rated it 4 or 5 stars then. It is still an enjoyable and entertaining show, but there is less emphasis on the writer's skills, less interaction with his daughter and mother (which was truly fun to watch), the writing is not always fresh at this point--something any television show has to struggle with after several seasons. The way the murders are solved is a bit predictable--the first suspects are never the killer. However, we keep watching because there is still a good deal of character development for the ensemble cast; there are still surprising plot twists and continuing story lines, and in the end we really like the actors and the characters they play."
4,I'm a Fan of The Show,"I watch this program regularly.......I like it so much, I want to keep it.So I purchase all the DVD's as soon as they are available"
3,pain in the ?,i must say his daughter is more a pain with each episode a right spoiled brat..lol other than that the episode was good
4,Great season,They just keep getting better. Castle and Becket are keeping the sexual tension going. Good going to the writers and actors.
3,Significant Others The first let down from Castle,"For the first time I am disapointed with the Castle series. ""Significant Others"" played a worn-out ending plot that let the whole show down. I have enjoyed the series and will keep buying it,but I may change my mind if this goes like alot of other series have. Lost of story ideas."
3,not as good as the prior seasons,"I am a big fan of both Stana and Nathan but, like any good show, I think they are close to the end of their lifespan."
2,Season 5,"I have always been a fan of Castle and enjoyed the first four seasons. However, season 5 is a huge disappointment so far. I think the writers lost their touch. The episode with the film crew following the police around was just stupid and the Captain's fawning over them downright embarrassing. Monday night's episode with the Santa also left much to desire. Please writers, if you want to keep your fans, earn your salaries and do a better job. Just my opinion..."
2,"I used to like this show, too, but it's on its deathbed now","The same old same old, another cop show with a so-called best selling author sidekick. This kind of show has been done to death. ANOTHER cop show? Adding a writer of fiction cop books to the same old same old mix is something new?It was cute for the first season, all that sexual tension between them, but now that's over and now the show is slowly dying. It won't see another season."
5,BEST EVER,It just keeps getting better and better. My favorite show of all times and I have seen them all. Keep it coming.
4,"Great music, but suffers from some repetion","I saw Martin Guerre in Winter of 98. The show had been reworked and was improved from the original. The music on this CD is pre - rework and it is not as good as what finally was presented. The show still needs more work. (it has closed now) I am hopeful that it will be brought back once again better than ever. It has the potential to be a blockbuster. ""Tell Me To Go"" is worth the price of the CD all by itself. You RENT fans out there, give Martin Guerre a listen. I think you will love it."
3,Predictably OK,"In a world ruled by probability, all predictions eventually come true (no matter how impossible.) That said, ignoring the obvious can be disastrous, but the authors methods for prioritizing risk were disappointing."
2,Only if you have nothing better to do...,Very limited in the captivating department...I would recommend this game only if you have nothing better to do.
1,Horrible Game,"I am wondering if I played the same Operation:Flashpoint as the rest of the reviewers because this was the latest in a long line of terrible military 1st person shooter games. The graphics are mediocre, while the playability is absolutely horrible. I took this game back and exchanged it less than an hour after buying it. It ranks among the worst military shooters I have ever played along with the Delta Force games, the Clancy games(The Rainbow Six series that is), and others. Don't waste time or money on this ... game. It's disappointing that no one seems to be able to come up with a good 1st person military adventure shooter game. The only two decent ones I've seen recently were Medal Of Honor and Return To Wolfenstein. Again, don't waste money on this awful game."
2,LAME,"I hate this game so much I have to write another review. All these people who love this game must have been living in a cave for the last 5 years playing Pac Man. Thats about where this game stands- The graphics are so absolutely horrible I can't bear to think of it. The game is full of terrible, terrible voice overs and cheesey little cut scenes, and your soldier runs like he just learned how. On top of that you have voices of other characters that were rendered by Speak And Spell. The developers had a good idea, but failed at their attempt. The quality just isn't there. DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY- You were warned!"
4,One of the Best....,"I have all of the Rainbox six games and I thought I would give this one a try. I am running 98SE, 1.4 gig Athlon, 512 DDR, Sound Blaster 5.1 live and Nvidia Mx400 64meg tv out card. I also have cambridge soundworks fps2000 digital sound w/sub. This is one of the best games I have ever played. The graphics are superb. You can actually see and hear the rain (with EAX). Thunder etc.. The game runs better with more of the ""goodies"" like I mentioned above, but will run on less(of course). I recommend this game to anyone into 1st person shootem up/tactical games. You have the ability to Drive vehicles and fly choppers, command squads etc. If you can think of it you can do it in this game. This game is so much fun(Difficult/Hard, The AI seems to sense your where abouts - I recommend stealth whenever possible) that you may end of running late for work or school when you start playing!"
5,Unparalled Realaty,"I had to refrene my combat traning to play this one. You have to aim like a real rifle, hide like a real soldier, and think like a real commander on the stratigic level of combat. The only down side is the game programing. >> CHEAT; To take away one the the cons listed by Amazon for this game simple PRESS THE LEFT (SHIFT) + KEYPAD (-) then release and type ""SAVEGAME"". This will save your gave over and over again. So that bad guy that killed you 50 time can't do it 51 times. This is the best game I have played since Wolfstien 3D. Its get your heart racing and your brain thinking of how to win. Un-Matched by even Rainbow Six or Medal of Honor."
2,"Realistic, but clunky at times","I appreciated all of the details - realistic weaponry, transportation, missons, etc.. However, the graphics are awkward at times - trees and shrubs look very 2-dimensional. The textures on the figures are good, but their motions seem stiff.Last, the realism (like getting killed in one shot) is welcome, but can get tiresome. It should be a game after all."
2,A dog is still a dog,"This game is like going on a blind date. Your friends tell you that she is cute. You talk to her on the phone, and she seems really nice. Then you pick her up, and she's a dog. Shallow, well maybe, but still true. It is a major letdown.This game was the same for me.1. Graphics are not up to par with current titles in the same genre.2. The radio comms are horrible. I can't listen to them for very long before I shut down the game.3. The voice acting (and scripting) is LAME.My final verdict. I should have checked out the demo. And as for my last blind date, I should have demanded a photo.Someday I will learn."
5,Makes you want to wear a flakjacket when you play it,"In the first-person view, this is one of the most engrossing games I have ever played. I have the sense that I am inside the game rather than watching it. You have 360 degree free-range of the entire field of action. I have not yet played the campaign, but the senarios are varied -- play a sniper, a helicopter pilot, a Delta Force operative, a ground troup, tank commander, etc. In all, you also have the option for 3rd-person view.The AI does not reposition the enemy when a senario is replayed and the enemy often does not spot you quickly. This may well be the result of the ""cadet"" level I am playing as I learn the game.The positives of this game far outweigh the negatives. If you are a fan of wargames, you will love this one!!"
5,Great Game,"This is one of the best games ever! It is amazingly realistic. If you are shot in the chest or head good-bye. Leg: limp or have to crawl. Arm: lets just say it's going to take a few shots to bring a guy down. The enemy AI is great also. They throw grenades, target officers not grunts, and have very keen eyes. The single player missions are incredible! My favorite is when you land on the beach and have to capture a airport. It's ... hard, but very fun. Anyone who likes FPS should buy this game!"
5,Outstanding...but make sure to get the patches,"Pros:Fantastic gameplayExcellent AIVery RealisticIntriguing storyAll-around addictingCons:Needs the patches to play decently!Blocky graphicsMediocre sound and voice actingCheezy music...but the pros vastly outweigh the cons...This is a simulation, not an arcade game. It needs to be treated as such. It is very ambituous. It is very, very fun. Highly recommended....this is one of the treasures of 2001 games business."
5,...speachless,"Im..Im just proud i even played it. OF:CWC is the most realistic team based game there is. This is what started me on the genre.... and im glad it did! There is just soo much effort put into this game that you forget that you are in your house but... im not saying you will feel you're in the game because thats chessy but that its just you and the computer in a totally black room. Now.... this is a extremly team game because your commander is right when he says noone wants to be a hero.. i learned this myself... you need your team to stay alive... everybody has their own job and its just WOW... listen get this game... then get expansion(s)... then ghost recon...then that expansion(s)...then get battle field 1942 and then those expansion(s).... LISTEN, just get the game and thats a order SOLDIER!"
3,Wolf,"A good game, when it came out, though it's a bit dated and behind the technology, now. However, it's a lot cheaper than some of the hot new games. It has different modes, within the war campaign. In first-person-shooter mode, it is generally fun, though sometimes, there are long, boring scenarios. Later in the campaign, when you drive tanks, the controls are too confusing, and it can become VERY frustrating. Also later in the campaign, you serve as an officer and must give orders to other soldiers, which is just too complicated and more like work than fun."
3,controls and views confusing,"It may be that I just finished Max Payne (the best game I've played in a long time) and then bought this game, but I don't like it that much. The Delta force series is so much better. the missions are not clear and I got lost serveral times and it took forever to find my way back. Ok so this may be more realistic, but not very fun. When you have two hours to enjoy a computer game and just hide and run around in the woods, only to be shot...well maybe thats fun to somepeople but not me."
1,I'm Shocked,"I'm surprised to find good reviews for Operation Flashpoint. I played the demo and just from the game play this game stinked. Maybe I'm just spoiled with Half-Life's Counter Strike and SWAT 3, but the game play was very poor. Graphics weren't anything special. Kind of reminded me of Delta Force, which is a fun, but outdated first person shooter. Maybe you'll like this game. I recommend getting the demo first to test the game play. After all what good is a game if it has good graphics and bad game play? But this game in my opinion had neither. ;D"
5,oh dear god,this game is so fun you just have to try it i just bought it 2 days ago and i think im still saying machine gunner spotted in my sleep to ive you a little bit of inside il tell you about a mission i made with the camapaign editori was on a hill and saw a sniper i quick;ly set my sights on him and started to zoom in for a shot when all of a sudden just as i shoot one of my soldiers runs by and gets shot in the back by me i zoomed in on the sniper and saw he was zeroing in on either me or my wounded man i couldnt risk a medic so i zeored in and shot him but it was too late for the soldier after wards i proceded to conquer a base and in one tense moment i was in the firefight of my life 1 man wounded 2 men killed bullets flying everywhere it was amazingu gotta buy this game althoug its tough to learn everything its worth it
2,Not a good game,"first off i am not one of these people who get easily discouraged, However with that said i could not even fishn the game cause it was no fun. This game suffers from realism at the expense of fun. First off lets get the basics down,The graphics stink and compare to the same games od that year it should have been betterthe controls are ok but the vehicle mission control are awefulthe weapons are plenty bet there accuracy leaves much to be desired.the levels are vast and you can do alot in them i will give it that.The story is not all that revealing and the characters feel fake rather than realThis game if for anyone who values realism over fun that aint me i play games to enjoy the experience. however there might be people who like realism more than fun and if so this is your game"
2,not his best,"i love peter kater's workand this isn't one of the best; one or two tracks have that beautiful depth he is so elegant at conjuring in essence, or many of his other projects..."
3,It's cheap but loose weave gives it limited uses,"I'm going to agree with a previous reviewer... it's very loosely woven, more than I thought it would be. I purchased it for weed suppression and to keep newly planted grass seed moist. The weave is so loose that I had to put down 2 layers to get the desired effect and even then young grass was able to grow right through it. It is cheap though considering good quality burlap can run you $8 a yard at a fabric store, but then again good quality burlap could be washed and reused. I will end up shredding this for the compost pile after one season."
2,Dissapointed,"I bought this book, because of its title and was really disappointed. I assumed that it would be about ""charmed"" as it's tille suggests ""Charmed companion guide"" But I was seriously wrong. I know many of You are interested in being a wiccan like the Halliwell Sisters, I am not, i just enjoy the show, and was completly uninterested in the book, execpt for the last like 20 pages, where the episode guide is. I Think the book makes fun of ""Charmed"", For not being completly realilstic in the magic but made fun of the actresses, and had only negative things to say about the show. However if your into witchcraft then this is a practical book, but otherwise save your money. They shouldn't have misleading titles on stuff."
3,The Book of Shadows : The Unofficial Charmed Companion,"I expected more information pertaining to the TV series, Charmed. This book is interesting, yet not entirely consistent with the TV series, as I had hoped. I find the show entertaining - as it claims on the commercials, takes you away for an hour. Although I believe to some degree that witchcraft is a viable practice, I was interested in the entertainment value of a book that strictly adhered to the series use of it."
3,Unofficial (BOS) review,"I enjoyed reading this book and even learned a few other things that I didn't know. If you like Charmed, then I think that you'll like this book."
4,The Book of Shadows : The Unofficial Charmed Companion,"Its a good book actually, tells history spells origin, potions, gems, plants used and so on a really good book I advice to buy"
5,Book of shadows,I loved the programme and the book gave me an insight into the charaters and the story line.
2,unofficial charmed companion book of shadows,this book is based on the tv show. it has warnings to be carefull what you are doing. It has no real basis on theactual book of shadows. Not a book for actual witches!
1,I Can't Believe This,I haven't read this book and I won't read this book. Charmed is an entertaining show but it is fiction! There is nothing remotely related to Wicca that you can learn from this show. I would not recommend this book as one for beginners to the Wiccan Religion.
3,Great Book,"When I purchased this book, I didn't realize it was a companion to the television show ""Charmed"". As an eclectic witch, I see that it had several wonderful guides for beginners into the Craft, and if you watch the show, all the better."
2,Suggestions 4 a new book,"There should be one book with all the spells from 'The Book of Shadows,' because I am really interested in th spells from the programme ""Charmed."" This book should be called something like: ""Spells From The Book of Shadows."" I alsp think you should advertise this book and other Charmed books to local and school libraries.I don't really think this book is very good because it has nothing to do with the programme ""Charmed"" and I expected it to be about: ""The Book of Shadows"" which the sisters keep in the attic. However all of the other Charmed books are brill, and I think there should be more and more books."
3,it works,i would say this is more for the teenager. a wiccan basics thats helps to differenciate between reality and make-believe
4,good,It was a great guide. I would recommend to other people. Charmed is a good tv show. You should come out with one for all seasons.
2,Charmed- unofficial,"A general book on Wica practice and a few parts from Charmed, I was hoping for more spells used on Charmed and some of the book of Shadows stuff, not in there!"
1,not worth the money,"I found this book to be a total disappointment, when I wanted the book of shadows, I thought it would be like the one on the show. Full of spells and pictures of demons, warlock's etc. Not full of herbs and scientific mumbo jumbo. I found it so boring I couldn't even get to chapter three. I am a great lover of the show and I fill this book is not worth the money I paid for it! And would advise others not to waste you money on this book, I wish I hadn't! I'm not a witch or interested in spells, but I truly believed the book of shadows would be like the one in the show. Unless your studying science I rate this book a zero, but sadly Amazon doesn't have zeros."
1,Beware,"This is not about the series. Kids should avoid. It is geared for people who want to learn about modern day witches, witchcraft, etc. That's fine, but lots of people like the Charmed show and it barely touches upon that. Returned."
5,Why this book is so relivant....,"This book is great for so many reasons, I could not write them all here. However, the one reason that stands out is all the questions asked, as well as the differences of opinions and views. I would like to remind everyone that yes this is a ""Television show"" make believe, and yet they have added some truth in little places and practices. People looking to buy this book should really realize this. To put it simply "" I wanted to be wonder women when I was young, but, I never saw an invisable plane or tried to find one."" Still it is a wonderful way to escape from the now adays terror and tragedys that are occuring around us. So if you want to enjoy the show, enjoy the show. If you want to learn more about Wicca or what have you, this book is a great way to start off as well. My philosophy ""To each their own"". Enjoy."
3,The Book of Shadows: The Unofficial Charmed Companian,"Like many other reviewers here when I first opened this book I expected to find reviews on each episode and stuff like that. Instead I found spells and other magic things. Reading this inspired me to become a Wiccan, however when I researched on the web I found that most of the information in this book doesn't actually follow any Wiccan laws. It also doesn't touch at all on the religion that is involved whenever you become a Pagan."
1,Not what I expected!,"I thought it was an overveiw of the T.V. Show Charmed. Much to my surprise it was about spells of protection and what crystals mean. If you want to study the Wiccan culture I guess it would be a good place to start. It does have some of the overviews of the series However it is not the infamous ""Book Of Shadows"" on the television series."
4,Great read,Very good reading. I was impressed by the knowledge. I expected it to more about the show with very little information about wicca.
3,book of shadows,"Ilove charmed thought this book would be more about the series. Was disapointed that the book picked apart the series as to say what is real and not. This is a show for our entertainment not a true story. most people that are true wiccans realize that,and do not watch to discover new spells etc...I love the characters of charmed which is why I tune in every week.."
3,criticizem is not the way,"when you criticize ""charmed"" like you did at the begining of the book, you disexcite the fans. a fan buys the book, expecting to find information about the craft like it is in the series. I opened it and found criticizem about how accurate it realy is... you took the charm right out of ""charmed""."
5,Great Lights,Love these lights. I live where there is alott of dear at night... Without these lights Im sure i would have gottin into an accident more than once... I have had them since my truck was new in 2002. Cant live without em!
2,Small!! 1/4 the size of the usual supermarket version,"Wow, I was super surprised at the size of this soup mix. I use to buy the same brand from Ranch 99 in Southern Cal. And when I opened the box, the mix I was sent was the mini-version or trial size. Only 8 oz! What a rip off, the price and the shipping. Please be aware that you are getting the small version!"
3,OK,Read the reviews before I purchased because the shipping was so high. The other reviews rated the product very high so I took a chance. I was disappointed. It is not as good as restaurant soup. Its not bad but hardly restaurant qaulity. I added tofu and egg to the mix and it was OK. I will not purchase again.
3,"Good, but not that hot","this is a very mild ""hot and sour"" soup. Not as spicy as what I've found in restaurants. It has no MSG, though and is probably the only mix that doesn't have that ingredient.It's a very bargain price. One can makes a lot of servings, like ten as I recall. We ordered three cans: we were bored with it by can 1. It's decent but we aren't that thrilled with it."
4,hot and sour soup,this made a pretty authentic tasty pot of soup. i enjoyed it alot and it was so easy!
4,More informational than one would think,"Although the book is very silly and even facetious at times, it's based on a lot of really interesting historical figures. The illustrations make the book."
5,A fun and quick read!,"How to Rule the World is a very entertaining book. It accurately speaks about the way in which to become a dictator, but in a humorous way. It also highlights dictators that have been and speaks about their strengths and weakness in order to teach the reader how to avoid the mistakes of those before them. It speaks about the dictator in a way that makes it very easy to understand that even a young child could understand some of the points the author is trying to get across. If you are interested in dictatorships and how they are able to come about this is a great book to read due to it's accuracy and how easy it is to read. At the end the author speaks about his own failed attempts towards ""ruling the world"", whether or not it is a true story is highly questionable."
5,Lets get ready to rule!!!,"Samuel Johnson said ""There are few minds to which tyranny is not delightful"", and when it comes to this amusing little book, how right he was. Serious students of world domination may start with Machievelli's ""The Prince"", the rest of us can have a laugh over this.The chapters are an interesting tempters - they include ""Have You Got What it Takes?"", which details the ideal personality of a leader; ""Career Paths to the Top"" which lists 10 jobs likely to lead to world domination (one is a parking inspector); ""Advanced World Rule"" which discusses among other things founding a faith and ""Posterity - Leaving Your Mark"" - the joy of large monuments and best selling memoirs. There are enough real life tales here, told very tongue in cheek to make this quite an informative little book, but really it is just a very funny dig at the dictators and autocrats of the world. An agonisingly serious topic no doubt, but very funny here! Enjoy!"
3,"Humourous, but ultimately of little help.","A friend handed me a copy of How to Rule the World, knowing my love of tyranny and long-standing desire to rule my own state. While I found the book to be cute, there is little new information for anyone who has seriously considered the path of the despot. As a light read that can be knocked out within a few hours, I recommend this book as a motivational pick-me-up to anyone seeking the path to power. It is a brief reminder that commitment, violence, and shameless backstabbing will pay off in the long run."
4,funny!,"This book is historically informative and hillarious! If you've got any secret plans to rule, how to avoid conpirators or how to acquire power and keep it... this is your new bible."
4,Good value for money,Its a decent product for the price. Its pretty sturdy. The rubber base ensures that it does not slip in water. The height can be adjusted which is nice.
4,Helped so much,"I broke my Ankle and I got the go from my Doctor to take a shower!Putting it together was super easy. It fits in my tub slightly snug but it works none the less.It's comfortable and the handles come in handy, I use the handles to drape my wash clothes on it as well. Good product for the price!"
5,Great Purchase for the Price,Purchase for elderly mother. She loves it. Shopped around and could not have found a better deal. Great option to choose from.
1,Shower Chair,"I used this chair 3 times, and after that I did not trust it. I have a standard size tub/shower and the chair really JUST fit in it so room to manuver was limited. I think that as long as you keep the height adjustments to the first two settings you may be OK, but if you try to get higher that that THOSE LEGGS WILL BEND!!!. For saftey reasons I would not recommend this especially for folks like me who have bad backs and sitting too low defeats the purpose of having the chair."
1,UnSafe,"This seat is unsafe. We have adjusted the legs several times. They still bend out to far. It has put me in the floor many of times. I'm recovering from two broken ankles in two spots and broken foot. I wish, I could give it a better review. I have stopped using the seat. I would rather have the pain in standing then falling in tub."
3,"Bath bench ok, not perfect","The legs spread out too far to sit in the tub correctly. It had to be placed in the tub the long way, so when sitting on the bench your back is to the shower doors or the long wall. Because of the slight tilt on the tub, you are actually sitting at an angle."
1,disappointed,"I rated this item poorly partly due to the lack of parts included in the shipment but primarily to Amazon's lack of response to the incomplete shipment. The package lacked two hand screws needed to complete assembly of the shower seat. Without the appropriate number of Screws the seat cannot be safely assembled. I bought the seat due to impending back surgery. Trying to figure out what I needed to do to get the missing screws was not clear so I asked Amazon to help me get the parts. The response was ""send it back or try to deal with the manufacturer"". Not helpful."
4,it got me through,This shower seat wasn't recommended by my occupational therapist because it is curved and she thought that would be harder to get up from. But it helped me shower and that's all that matters.
1,Lousy ....,"The legs are somewhat splayed looking at purchase. After few uses and less than 45 days, the legs have splayed out very far, cannot be returned to normal and it is unsafe to use. This is a total waste of money as it has to be tossed out now."
1,Collapsed in Shower,I purchased the bench for my wife after reading the reviews. After receiving it and setting it up it looked good and worked fine for over two months in the shower. Suddenly the legs on one side partially folded dumping my wife onto the floor of the shower. Fortunatly there were no injuries. Weight was not a problem. We are now looking at stools.
2,Rusty,The legs leave rust on the bathtub where they touch. I took the rubber caps off the bottom of the legs and they were full of rust. Since when did aluminum rust?
3,good design,"I bought this for my Senior aunt, who needs to sit when taking a shower. The layout of the product is pretty good, and simply easy to put together. She appreciated the gift."
3,wobbly legs,love the bench during foot surgery recovery process. only concern is wobbly legs in my tub. maybe i cant tighten screws enough. tetighten resolves but im 160 pounds which these days is light...id be more concerned if i weighed more about the legs collapsing on me
3,Became too unstable,"This stool was very stable for the first couple of months. But the nuts had to be tightened at increasingly short intervals until it was too scary to use anymore. We are not overweight. Plus, keeping it clean was difficult. I would still like to have a bath stool but won't replace this one with a similar one."
3,it was too wide,"I wasn't willing to pay the price for the nicer teak benches. This was the best price i found on a shower stool and met all my needs. i was, however, sad because it was too wide for my shower/tub combo."
1,Breaks easily,"This says it supports 250 pounds. I'm 225, and the legs were quickly bent out of shape, making the bench unusable. I think you would have to be significantly under 225 pounds for this to be ok."
1,Metal inside rubber caps rusts onto shower floor,"I've had this bench for about a year. Each of the 4 rubber caps on the legs has a small hole in the center and a metal disk inside. Over a few months, the metal disks rusted and the rust ran out of the small holes, staining my shower floor. Months after removing the metal disks and replacing the rubber caps with solid ones (no holes), my shower floor still has rust stains I haven't been able to remove."
1,Piece of junk!,"I had this product for little over 6 months. Worked great for about 5 months and thats when we started seeing problems. The chair legs started to bend (made up of some cheap aluminium material). I removed the screws, removed the bend and fix it up, but its of no use. The chair is totally useless now and I am returning it...won't get a full refund, but its okay. I'll never again buy any product from Medline."
1,legs went in opposite directions,"Following foot surgery, we purchased this chair for help in the shower. The chair never sat securely on the ground and after two uses, the legs basically buckled under. My 140 lb husband almost fell flat on the ground. It is a dangerous product. I will return it."
1,Don't buy this,This item is not worth buying. The legs bent and I had to throw it away and buy a different stool. There is not enough support for the flimsy aluminum legs. I'm not a big person and it bent with me so don't bother buying this.
1,Not worth a dime,"I recently purchases this shower bench for my mother, let me tell you it's not worth the time or money. This shower bench legs just seem to melt each time she uses it, she actually feel off of it twice because of the calapsing of the legs on this thing. My mother only weighs 135 lbs, this item claims to hold 250 lbs, but it clearly can't hold 150 lbs. It would cost me more to send it back, after the restocking fee's, in all I would be out of more than I spent from the beginning. I would NOT recommend this product to anyone."
4,Bath bench a good buy.,Good solid bench with easy adjusting of height. The suction cups on the legs provide additional stability. Easy to pull up and move the bench.
2,"Good Item, Wrong Delivery",I ordered the Medline Bath Bench without Back in Gray. Although a great item in quality I had to unfortunately return this item since the vendor shipped the wrong color. I ordered gray and they sent me white. The only option given was to return the item. This is a major inconvenience since I cannot drive and because I will have to wait another 2 weeks before I obtain an item I need for daily use. Would not recommend this vendor.
4,It works,"I bought it so I could bathe while recovering from surgery. It doesn't fits in my bathtub (lengthwise), and is sturdy enough to support my weight (170 pounds). Easy to put together. Easy to clean. For an elderly person, I would probably advise to go with something more sturdy."
4,"Great bench, but too big for std bath tub","This is a very well made bench, very sturdy and comfortable. Altho it is WAY too big for a standard bathtub, is great for a stall shower. I gave 4-stars instead of 5 because of its inappropriateness for a bathtub."
1,Disappointment,"Very disappointed with the this bench very shakey and to large for the tub not worth sending it back, I gave it away."
5,Great,The product arrived on time. It was easy to assemble and is meeting the needs for which it was purchased.
5,I love Everlasting Pictures,"Has to be one of the best instrumentals I've ever heard, right next to Mermaid by Sade and Perfect Love by Shakatak. Perfectly relaxing, absolutely intoxicating, suits just about any activity or just listening to by yourself. I sent Mom one for Mother's day last year and she loved it. However, I don't recommend it for long car trips. It's a little TOO relaxing for that!"
4,Sexy voice Julie is great to listen too,Julie London uses her sexy voice to great advantage in this CD. Nice CD to listen to if you want some quiet time music. Glad I bought it.
3,poor quality,"This is not so much a review as it is meant to be informative. First: The music is wonderful! Second: This recording is straight off old LP's with far too many clicks and pops, which at times is very distracting to the excellence that was Julie London. The songs are from some of her best recordings; just be aware that you may not be satisfied with the poor sound quality."
5,Spellbound,"A very different George Michael From his Wham days. This album definitely demonstrates the versatility and talent of George Michael as an artist. His music in this Album does not adhere to any boundaries which is what makes it so special...one of my favorite tracks is ""strangest thing"" just listen to the words and the melody and you too will be captivated."
4,HES STILL GOT IT,"Older definitely provides a sharp contrast from George Michael's early days with Wham!. But he remains consistent in producing excellent lyrics about life experiences. In addition, Older is more mature as well, which should be expected with a title like Older. With the exception of Fastlove the songs are all slow and soothing. The first hit off the album Fastlove is an excellent song as well. In my opinion the album, Older, has to take a back seat to Faith and Listen Without Prejudice Vol.I but it is still a smart choice for any George Michael fan."
5,Have the guilty feet turned into a guilty heart?,"I have been listening to George Micheal ever since Wham! came into play back in '81 or '82. Being only a couple years younger than him, I thoroughly enjoyed the upbeat, bubble-gum, let's go have a party tracks that seemed to dominate his albums. At that time in my life, those unrealistic, pop fantasy (ala Beach Boys ""Wouldn't It Be Nice"") songs did it for me. But as I have matured, and as Michael has matured, the perception of life and love have changed. I like the direction he's gone in; his lyrics say the things I wish I knew how to say. I feel pain and a strange strength in the songs on ""Older"". ""Jesus to a Child"" is simply one of the greatest songs I've ever heard. But I have to wonder: if these songs are somewhat autobiographical (as I can only assume they are), what is it Michael is blaming himself for?"
4,"Older, more mature","This album by G. M. is different than his others. It;s filled with slow, jazzy sounds. More mature in a way. Even though there are a lot of slow songs here, and I'm not crazy about all of them, there are some which are just excellent, and so makes up for the other songs.1) Jesus To a Child = a slow, but beautiful song. Really beautiful (4/5)2)Fastlove = A great dance song. One of my favorites by George M. It's upbeat, sexy and just great! (5/5)3)Older = another slow song, jazzy. (3.5/5)4)Spinning the Wheel = A mellow song. Nice flow to it. Not bad (3.5/5)5)It doesn't really matter = Another mellow song. Kinda repetitive. Okay a lot!! Not my favorite (2/5)6) The Strangest thing = pretty song (4/5)7)To be forgiven = slow, nice song 3.5/5)8) move on = a little different, jazzy (4/5)9) Star people = faster pace, not too funky but nice (4/5)10) You have been loved = kinda like jesus to a child (4/5)11) Free = no lyrics (4/5)"
4,Great 'miserable' CD,"Bought this CD when it came out and like it just as much now as then. Really like the sense of melancholy about it. It's clear George is quite sad and bitter at this point in his life and if you're feeling down, this is really soothing. The message, I think, is hopeful, though: ""I'll be fine"" sings George. Also it's a very honest album, unlike much music by superstars. Strangest Thing about the best thing George has done and agree the You Have Been Loved is outstanding."
5,Absolutely excellent,You would have to have an ounce or two of intelligence to appreciate the intricacies of these musically creative and lyrically innovative songs. Also a round or two of being knocked in the head with life's harsh realities would help to understand them. I played this album in my office and was surprised nonetheless that several people asked to take it home to listen to it or just plain went out and bought it. This is not however a young Wham style party album but a very stimulating reflection of life and living after the all night party scene but well before the nursing home.
5,Stunning talent,"I purchased 3 copies of this cd so I am never without it - home, car , office and purchased another for a friend. I am a recent fan - duh! but this mans talent is just stunning to me - I have all CD's - this is the best! Waiting for White Light to be delivered - out of words"
3,Not up to GM's high standard,I'm surprised at all the excellent reviews. This CD pales in comparison to Faith and Listen without Prejudice. There really aren't any good songs on this album
2,"His older tunes are superior to ""Older.""","I've been a huge GM fan ever since Wham, and I think ""Faith"" and ""Listen Without Prejudice"" are brilliant. But this CD is a huge disappointment. Perhaps GM focused too much energy on getting out of his previous contract and not enough on the music. Not worth the money."
3,not what I expected,I thought I had ordered a booklet to help me communicate the basics with some of my friends.It's basically for use if a person is in the country and looking for simple communications.
1,Diamond quality,I didn't like this product because the diamonds looked nothing like the picture. The diamonds are flawed more than a little bit.
1,Don't buy it...,"Ok, I will have to put in this caveat: Maybe my nearly six hundred dollar expectations were a little high. I may have been mistaken in expecting pants to go into the press to come out smoother than they went in. Silly me.... I have tried about ten different style of pants and hoped that at least one would come out okay. This is a HUGE waste of money. I wish someone had reviewed this piece of junk before I bought it."
2,corby pants presser,Nice appearance; overpriced; product performance less than satisfactory due to wrinkled padding on the pressing board which presses wrinkles into the trouser legs.
5,A great cookbook,"I bought this on a whim in the Indianapolis airport, but the cookbook turned out to be a tremendous find. Many recipies focus on one specific flavor, such as the delicious crunchy green beans or poached fish with pesto. Others blend flavors magnificently, like the white bean chile recipe. Highly recommended!"
4,Knew what I was buying,I had seen a copy of this previously and decided it was worth having in my own collection. Most recipes are worthwhile.
3,"You've seen the TV show, now read the book!","I don't know how you pronounce ""pajamas"", but for me this book don't rhyme. There's just something about an entire series based on a pun that annoys me. These bananas aren't very cuddly, nor are they very appetizing. Kids, however, seem to get a kick out of them. And who could argue with that? If your kids seem to like the TV show, might be they'll like this book. But if you're an adult reading this book to your kids, be prepared for a bore. I gave this book three stars because, honestly, it's not a *bad* book. But I didn't find it particularly charming either."
4,Craft Your Story,"This book emphasizes the need to determine exactly what image and story will connect you with your target job. It provides current, relevant, well-formatted examples for executives. The work-sheets and steps are adequate, but not overly insightful. This is a book that is worth browsing from the library to find examples that resonate. Reading the rationale for the story approach is worthwhile. You'll want to find another book to walk you through the details of resume construction as a complement to this one."
4,Many styles to choose from,"This book gives many, many examples of resume styles. Nothing new or innovative in the text of the book. Very helpful for someone that wants a fresh look to the same boring resume style."
3,Awesome album hindered by a half hearted Rollins,"This was the final album with the Mark II Line up of the Rollins Band. Musically, you can't get any better. Black Sabbath and King Crimson with Mahauvishnu type funky jams, and the songs are VERY tightly arranged. But it was Rollins who seems absent here. Distant and not very well heard. Can this be blamed on the producer? Possibly. Hammerin' Hank is put thru reverb and echo and sounds as if he was yelling in another room some of the time, far from the center of attention he was on previous albums. The ""singing"" and lack of intensity on his part put the intense music down a notch. It was much more balanced before. There are glimpses of Rollin's former brilliance, but its obvious why the Mark II lineup (the best line up of Rollins band, much like Danzig's band from I-IV) broke up shortly thereafter. If only they'd remix/redo the vocals, and it would be up there with Weight.This is the first of a series of reviews I will be doing on the Rollins Band."
3,End of Rollins,"Actually - take down another half a star. Ok, this is where I got off the Rollins boat once and for all. Weight definitely showed signs of weakness, especially coming on the heels of one of the most awe-inspiring albums of all time, The End of Silence, but still had enough to merit listens. Come in and Burn, on the other hand, falls so flat and precipitously after the first three or four songs, it's a net waste of your time, just draging on and on with no end in sight. Tedious jams goin' nowhere. So - that's it. I quit Henry, and have no idea what he's been doing since. Hope he's well. Heard he ditched the band for some hair metal L.A. band. Another great move. Whatever. The early Rollins Band albums, notwithstanding, will remain inimitable classics for a long time to come."
4,come in and burn and burn and burn,"Come in and burn is the last studio album from Rollins band mk. II (Rollins, Haskett, Cain and Gibbs)and is a strong end-piece for this unit. The two extra tracks: Disappearing act and Also ran are strong (except that the alternate lyric version of Disappearing act on the ""End of something"" single is better)The CD as a whole is great, but lacks some of the fire that many had come to expect from Hank. I think in retrospect that this had something to do with the elusive ""chemistry"" problem. For example, while tracks like ""Starve"", ""On my way to the cage"" and ""Neon"" rock hard, tracks like ""Thursday afternoon"" and ""Inhale/exhale,"" while good, seem a little out of place (and character) for Rollins. I would call this Rollins' version of The Bells (Lou Reed) or New Values (Iggy Pop), in other words, a good ambitious album that is somewhat out of character but needed to be made.Paul Mcd."
4,Food for fight,"When I listen to music, there is usually one thing that separates good music from bad: Whether it makes me feel something or not. Rollins makes me feel. His lyrics and music strike me as real. Yes, he tends to be repetitive and yes, he displays limited craftsmanship but that is not important. The music is about things that are difficult. Things that make life hard. Insecurity, hatred, self-loathing and fear. Hard, direct and to the point. Go for the jugular and mean it. That's what makes this album good."
2,Hollywood Hank goes out like a brick,"For years now rollins has been watering down his act, trying deparetely to gain the attention he so craves . Despite years of mocking ""rock stars"" , it is clear to see that he no doubt strives to be one. This is an uncomfortable record. Studio effects and rollins dont mix.From the opening track on ,you just know Rollins has lost his grit. He is at his best when he fronts his no nonsense band like a cornered, rabid animal. His earlier indie records are examples of his former glory as is black flag of course. But here we have an aging ,intentionally MTV friendly rollins and the older fans who havent already jumped ship surely will after hearing this . This record made me sad....another fallen hero i guess. Rollins was the last guy i would have predicted to sellout.Rollins could have been a legend but after alienating all his true fans ,he looks more like a cartoon character performing for the kiddies on MTV."
2,It was the end of the original band,"After the success of ""Weight"", The Rollins Band took it's time with a followup. ""Come In"" is largely unmemorable. Only a few tunes rise above the whole and the CD sank like a stone causing Henry to break up the original band soon afterwards. It would be three years before he'd recover and return from the failures of this CD. Only ""Shame"",""Starve"" and ""The End Of Something"" save ""Come In And Burn"" from being a complete waste of time.Fortunately for us, Rollins would recover and return with some of his strongest music in years."
2,...let's not kid ourselves,"this record is not good. rollins is over. this music is a sellout . rollins wants attention more than anything else. hank is just so transparent. this record is terrible .""starve"" is the only salvagable track. rollins should just go away .he is old and stale ,i am so tired of his ""iron man"" schtick. but hopefully there is a new breed of angst and testosterone fueled troubled teens who will listen to this garbage and pretend it is real. what a joke. grow up hank ,its getting boring man. what's your age again ?"
4,All you need to know (if you have the background),"Like all the small handbooks in the DK series, Moi Ali's Effective Public Relations is a summary of the field. It's well-presented and easy to follow and covers traditional PR (not more modern techniques such as stunt marketing or stealth marketing).It wouldn't be enough to get you started in the PR business, but it's a useful refresher if you once had a course in college, or a helpful adjunct for professional marketers who work with PR counsel."
4,"Fairly good, for the right situation.","There are numerous helpful pieces of information in this book, however, you have to realize that much of what is in the book is based on the experiences of a single person who was in a Federal Prison Camp for only 1 year and 1 day. If you're facing significantly more time than that or looking at a higher security institution I believe that a number of the personal observations just don't apply.In addition, there is some information that is just out of date as the BOP has updated policies. Things such as spending limits, wait times for RDAP or other programs no longer apply as policies have changed and overcrowding has continued to get worse.Overall a decent book that gives good basic information."
4,Math patterns playfully presented,"Shakuntala Devi presentes math patterns in an interesting, accessible and playful manner. I teach elementary math to teachers, and I think I'll use these chapters to start their math minds working at the beginning of our sessions. I think they might do that with students as well."
5,great book,"This is a great book for anyone at any age struggling with math, it explains it in , the easiest form possible. I bought it for my 12 year old, and she started reading it and never really put it down, it covers the very basics to the advanced, I highly recommend this book"
