3,"weak alarm, more useful for the weather information than alarm clock","The alarm continues for 80 or so seconds, then stops for the day. Other alarm clocks require some sort of intervention to stop them, but this one doesn't. The alarm is rather quiet, difficult to hear even only two feet from my head. Projection works fine, thermometers work fine, both indoors and out."
2,Poor description of product,"Manufacturer information says that unit can project time/ and or temperature. This is not true. Toggles between the two, and not able to be changed, per email from the company after I purchased it. Projection very dim. I had purchased a projection alarm clock for my son from Discovery Channel, and this works much better, much brighter, no waiting to see what the time is while the temperature projects."
1,Poor product,"I spent the extra on this alarm because I wanted a projection feature.The projection feature lasted 2 weeks.I also had a wall clock made by LaCrosse that does not accurately reflect either the temperature or the humidity.Save your money, folks.Hopefully, Amazon will refund my $$$"
2,Not as good as the older model...,"I purchased a similar La Crosse Projection Alarm approximately 10 years ago and loved it from day one. I recently decided to upgrade even though the old one still works as new. Thank goodness I did not throw the old one away as the new unit fails miserably in comparison. To begin with, the old clock has two alarms, not just one. Next, the earlier model allows you to select what is projected. I prefer to have only the time displayed but the new model can only alternate between time and temperature - quite aggravating. Finally, the old version allows you to preset the snooze time from zero to 55 minutes. I do not use the snooze feature so I set the time to zero and simply tap the snooze button once to turn the alarm off until the same time tomorrow. Like I said, I continue to use the original clock and put the new one in the guest bedroom."
4,Projection clock,"Works well, but wish the clock itself was lit during the day. I now have to have two clocks: one that lights up during the day and one for at night."
2,Disappointed,"I was looking for a replacement clock as the projection on my original alarm clock with projection died. This La Crosse is not near as good. Unfortunately, I could not find one like my original one. The temperature doesn't do me much good as it is always off by several degrees plus it is aggravating waiting to see the time when it is showing temperature. The clock does not set itself like it advertising and it is quite frustrating setting it. You definitely have to read the directions to figure it out! I am now using two alarm clocks as I like my old one as I can also see the time on it regularly day or night very easily where the projection is the only decent way to see the time on this clock. The actual clock display is horrible during the day and only possible at night, if you press the button on top. It also has no stability and falls over with the slightest bump."
2,"great idea, horrible execution","Love the concept of this projection clock/outside temperature. however, every couple months or so it decides to readjust the time 4 hours??? I have it set up correctly and for months it will go along nicely. Then randomly it jumps the hours just to f@*& with me. I'll wake up at 2AM and it's telling me it's 6AM, not funny! This has happened twice in approximately 4 months. The unit is pretty cheap and flimsy, you get what you pay for. But if this is your primary alarm clock, don't trust it! Still, I do like seeing the outside temp on my ceiling and as far as I can tell, it's fairly accurate."
2,Disappointed,This La Crosse weather station never worked as expected. Replaced it with one that does work. It did keep time.
3,projection clock,"this clock was ok. i was disappointed that the numbers were alot smaller than i had hoped for, other than that it is ok."
3,La Crosse Radio Controled Projection Alarm Clock,The La Crosse Radio Controlled Projection Alarm Clock projects the correct time and outside temperature as expected. However I have not been able to set the alarm or read the time or inside or outside temperatures on the face of the clock. Therefore it is only useful for reading the current time and outside temperature in the dark.
2,"Not well constructed, annoying buttons","I had an Oregon Scientific one and it broke after more than 7 years. So I decided to try out this specific model by La Crosse. (By the way, this was cheaper at my local electronics store.)The buttons are hard to press, and I don't have fat fingers. You need to press any of the buttons more than once to have it do something. The backlight is from one side and it does not illuminate the whole screen well. The projection size is VERY small, compared to my old Oregon Scientific one. I do not care to see the ourside temperature on the projection but there was no way to stop the toggling between the time and the outside temperature."
2,"Had to return, outdoor temp sensor useless!","I tried everything to make the outdoor sensor work and it would start out working but even at 5 feet away, by the next morning it would show - - - on my ceiling and i have to watch it for a few seconds just to see the time. Returning. will find just a normal projection clock."
3,Projection Unit Too Dim,"This clock does everything it says, including indoor and wireless outdoor, but the ceiling projection unit is far too dim to be usable. The characters are also so small on the ceiling that you have to put on your glasses - worthless."
1,DO NOT BUY!!,"In the picture it looks real nice but when it arrives it looks and feels just like a plastic necklace you would get out of a 25 cent machine. Its ""high polish"" is scratched up and the way it's made it comes with a fairly large hole in the top and bottom of the cross. It is a piece of junk and not worth the money. Oh and by the way they won't pick up the shipping cost for me to return it so I just lost $10 on this crappy necklace."
1,Not good at all,"I didn't like this nail clipper, the clipper is Hidden in the bee body and i couldn't get it to trim the baby nail, i think this is made for long nail not for baby's tiny nails, not recommending it at all."
3,Cute not practical,ADORABLE concept not very practical in use. I would say to save your money if you actually intend on cutting a squirming infant with these cutters. If you want something for them to look at while you use the ones from a hygiene kit you got from your shower then by all means get these. I still think they make a really cute accessory in a themed nursery (don't tell your husband that or he will veto this purchase)
1,Hard to use,"I bought these clippers because they offered a ""skin guard"" to prevent you from clipping too close. However, the guard (the bee's head) sticks out so far that it is impossible to clip my son's nails (he's one so I can't imagine trying to use it on a newborn when their nails are still so fine and closer to the skin). I even tried to use them on mine since they're a little longer and was unable to trim my nails with them. What a shame- becuase they are VERY cute!"
1,Useless and dangerous,"What was Sassy thinking? I bought this because my toddler pitches a fit when it's time to clip her nails, so I thought the cuteness/fun factor would help her tolerate it. I can't believe how poorly this thing is designed. It is virtually impossible to fit a squirming child's fingernail into the thing, and even if you do succeed it's dangerous because it's very difficult to see what you're doing. I didn't succeed in cutting a single nail, but I did manage to cut her skin. Into the trash it goes."
1,Don't buy these!,These don't even cut. The head sticks out so far that you can not get the babies nail in there to cut. Waste of money!
1,UNSAFE,Very difficult to use. I ended up clipping my infant son's finger because the bee's head prevents the accurate positioning of the blades. Throw them away! Product is dangerous and should be recalled!
5,bumble bee clippers,I realy like these clipers as a mom of four these are the only clippers i have found that keep you from cutting there nails to short
3,Jimmy Thackery is a talent,"This album has some good moments featuring Jimmy Thackery's guitar when he plays the blues. Note that his 'Wild Night Out' album is exceptional and should be considered well before this offering. On this album some of the tracks rate, for instance 'Wild Night Out', 'Lovin' you right', 'Trouble Man'. However, the much of the rest of the album is spoilt by his choice of songs that sound like something out of a 50s/60s rock and roll album. When he plays the blues, Jimmy shows he is one of the greats but the other tracks makes you hit the 'next' button as soon as possible."
4,"Basic, but detailed",An introduction to the financial markets. The book covers most financial instruments and goes into some detail about each type. It isn't US nor European centric. Well worth the price as most of The Economist series are.
3,Great Reference for Investors and Financial Students,"This book contains lots of details and technical language. For someone like me with little or no financial/economics background, the text can be difficult to understand. I only touched on a few topics in this book, for I only need a basic understanding of financial markets to invest in mutual funds. On the other hand, my brother, who is majoring in business and finances, would more likely benefit from this book.This book is a great reference for investors, business students, and those in the financial industry."
1,Adolescent angst,"Henry Rollins is like the neighbor who constantly purchases new gadgets to mount on the walls of his garage as some weird pack rat feng shui disorder. He's a front-of-the-class brown-noser blowing bubbles in his milk for the peanut gallery while batting lashes at the teacher. He's irrelevant because he's a shameless pundit for middle-class ennui, with a doctorate in blab. When they come out with the Henry Rollins android in the year 2120, its ""soliloquy"" button will never wear out, but you'll have to stock up on the ""projectile vomiting"" button. I remember the first time I saw the ""Liar"" video, Rollins all puffy-faced, eyes bright as a bunny caught in headlights, doing a constipated impression of Iggy Stooge, railing on and on about some kind of video game that made him mad because he couldn't figure out how to get to the next level."
1,Book not ok,Book was suppose to be in good condition but when i received it the cover was completely off the bindings.
5,Great!,"I Purchased this product for my husband for christmas, he never used an electric shaver before, he was always a razor man. My husband has very sensitive skin, but the SmartTouchXL has 3 shaving selections which included sensitive skin. I wasn't sure if this shaver was going to work as well as a razor, but it was great, it worked better then any razor could have, he absolutely loves it. His face is smooth and it cuts down his shaving time. Once the SmartTouch is charged it stays charged for a long time, it even tells you how much time you have left before you have to charge it again. This was a positive investment and a perfect present."
4,"Great Shaver, Don't count on Rebates!!!!","The Norelco 9190XL is a great shaving system. I've used Norelco's for over 30 years and this one is by far the best. The only complaint is really AMAZON not Norelco, the 9190XL was advertised with a $30 Amazon credit which never arrived. Be cautious on AMAZON Rebates & CREDITS!!"
3,New Shaver,After using Norelco shavers for over 40 years I am disappointed with this purchase.I don't get a full charge and the time indicator may indicate anywhere from 33 to 73 minutes.It takes me longer to shave than with my previous shaver and I do not have a heavy beard.All this for $200.
5,easy use and comfortable,It's very easy to use and clean. You also can know how much time that you can use very easily. The touch feeling is very comfortable!!!
4,"GREAT RAZOR , BUT NOT WORTH IT","SAVE YOUR SELF THE XTRA 75 BUCKS AND JUST GET THE 9160XL SAME RAZOR JUST WITH OUT THE USELESS DIGITAL FEATURE, THAT ISNT REALLY NEEDED"
3,massivly exagerated features and capabilities,"this product being so expensive has its benifts. it definately reduces the shaving time and is very convenient to have. However, all the things the company claims about it being good with every curve of your face is pretty much exageration. It does give a close shave on the face but the neckline is not covered by it at all. In fact its worse than a razor around the neck line. I got this for my husband and he likes the convenience it offers and i love the close shave he gets with it but it took him a few weeks to get used to it. He used to get crazy reactions to his skin. It used to get very red and irritated. the neck line issues still remain. he uses a razor to shave his neck line. subtract that from the features the company claims the product offers and u'd be left with a product that is not worth $200 at all. probably $130 with its fany looks and all but not at all worth 2 bills."
2,Norelco SmartTouch_XL,"Used consistently for the recommended 3 weeks. This model is marginally better than the earlier 955RX. It is slower to use than a standard blade razor with wet gel, provides nowhere near as close a shave, caused irritation and development of ingrowing hairs on the neck of this Caucasian user."
3,Inflight Shave?,"Not as good as a shaver, I use 5 blades, but when you are at 35000 Feet in plane, 10 hours into a flight, it's nice to get rid of the stubble.Which is the reason I bought it, for in flight travel shaving.Battery is great 72 mins it claims and I bet it would better.If you don't have access to a wet shaver place, and feeling rough, this is the 2 mins shave and good to go. It's quiet, but don't be standing out in the transfer lounge."
5,Wow.. what a shaver,"The fact that you can hold this under tap water to clean it is alone a great feature. But there is so much more, including the way it shaves your face without pulling on your beard even if it is long (most times for me). It also has a nice battery indicator screen and notifies you when you need to clean the thing. The battery lasts forever, seriously it is sometimes hard to believe how long it lasts.. buy this shaver, it is awesome."
5,A great razor with nice options.,"I really like this razor. This razor avoids a lot of the useless options and has many useful ones (like the lcd display with battery life - which is very nice if you travel often like I do). It shaves well and comes with a hard travel protective case (good for travel as well). If you can find it at a great price, buy it."
4,smoothe tunes,"The best reggae hits are on this album! The music is Hot if your a fan of Beenie Man, Anthony B, etc. you'll like it. Lots of music and mixxed well........."
2,the worst axe fragrance along with tsunami and phoenix,i am not 13 or under i am 17 years of age i am only using this under 13 thing because my puter sucks so bad it wouldnt let me use the other thing and this is the worst axe fragrance for me it smells like melon on my skin and thats only for 5 mins and then its gone with the wind the best axe fragrance for me is orion it smells the most expensive kilo spray is ok but the deo stick smells more decent. i heard there is a very popular cologne that smells exactly like axe orion i am trying to figure out what that cologne might be (...) by tim tomlinson.
2,About axe,These AXe only works for like the first 5 minutes that you put it on!? i wouldn't recomeend this if you want good fragrance that will last through out for the whole day but i agree that all of the Axe's smell great u Just need to carry it all day if you want to smell great all the time like the description says
3,Frame not for everyone,If not abused these glasses last fine but the clear flaw in the design is that the lens are set so low thast when you put them on your face its like looking out of a set of bifocals where half the day is night and the top half a sunny afternoon. A great buy if you always point your eyes at the floor.
2,good buy but....,"I thought the price of the glasses was too good to turn down so i decided to go through with the purchase. When i received the product they looked very cheap and poorly made. Throughout the first day i had the glasses they broke in the bag, which was in my pocket. I then tried to fix them and finally realized they could never be fixed.."
1,Unexpected,"I ordered these glasses because the title said they were mirrored. When I received the package--two and a half weeks later--they were, in fact, black. This is not what I paid for, not what I expected. I am disappointed in this product."
5,Overall Review,"Here's my overall review of the product, ordered from TheSourceGroup:- order shipped the next day and was received three days later- very good mirrored lenses- very dark, best for sunny days outside- sit somewhat low on face- not spring-hinged- came with large cleaning cloth/bag- quality is somewhat cheap, but good for the priceThese are the things I would've known before purchasing the product, and it was what I expected from reading the description of the product and other customers' reviews. I'm very satisfied overall: they aren't the best glasses ever, but they do look damn cool."
4,Really Dark Aviator Glasses,"I've always loved mirrored aviator glasses and there was such a great deal on these I couldn't pass them up. Well, if you like dark (and I mean really dark) sunglasses - these are for you. I have been wearing them regularly, but must admit, sometimes it's hard to see. They felt a bit cheaper than I thought they would be, but they came with a protective satchel and were on time. I paid less than what I think they're worth (which is good!). But, again really really dark!"
2,Disappointed,"I received the sunglasses late. I also noticed that it was bent out of shape and no sign of receipt or any form of billing document. The shades do look nice though, but the quality could have been better. Like many others have said, you get what you paid for."
1,Not the greatest,All I'm going to say is the price says it all...Not the best replicas they could be a bit more sturdier.After a while of messin with them and taking them on and off they tend to bend out and feel loose and you got to tighten up the screws a lot to get them to sit right.I would recommend something else more on the top dollar side.But they still look good I'll give them that much
2,Bent,"When I ordered this product, the entire frame was bent. The moment I tried on the glasses, one of the lens lagged to one side more than the other. I wouldn't recommend this product from this seller. I had to fix the frame with a set of pliers which was not very pleasing."
4,Good,"They provide great protection from the sun but, i found out they are not suppose to be used for driving, which is why i bought them in the first place. otherwise a great product."
2,Too Dark,"The sunglasses were only for very bright conditions(beach, etc.) to shield your eyes. They are not good if you are trying to do anything(driving, sports, etc.). You can not see much. Would be nice if the product description stated that they were very dark."
3,Good for the price,"I love the way these glasses look! The reflective lenses are so hip! However, the arms were bent when I received the glasses, so now my frames sit a little crooked.Still, a great deal for some cheap shades that I'll probably break anyway."
3,nice but cheap,Great glasses but you can tell they are cheap. But for the price they are more then good. I still wear mine and i have had them for like almost a year. the frames bend easily so you need to be careful wtih them.
3,DARK,"PRODUCT CAME QUICKLY AND IN GOOD SHAPE, BUT THE GLASSES ARE WAY TOO DARK! VERY DIFICULT TO SEE THE ROAD ESPECIALL WHEN DRIVING AND THE SUN DISAPPERRS BECAUSE OF A CLOUD. SOMETHING TO CONSIDER IN THE FUTURE, OTHERWISE GOOD GLASSES FOR THE PRICE."
4,Overall good glasses,"I have alot of other aviator style glasses.. these ones are cool and all the mirror finish definatly gets attention. But the only complaint on these is that the front of them are too flat... all my other aviators are more round so they fit the face better there are flat so sun still leaks threw the sides and is very distracting... the other thing is, is that they are super dark because of the mirror finish they are twice as dark as regular sunglasses so be careful when you are behind the wheel... and the last thing the hangers stems or whatever they are called.. the piece actually bulit to the fram that is held by the screw where you fold your hangers in is not extended far out enough so if you want to put them hanging on your shirt they sort of stick out they dont lay flat.Other than that over all cool glasses"
4,Super Comfortable Sunglasses,"My favorite thing about these sunglasses is the fit. I have a pretty small head and they fit wonderfully! They aren't too tight or too loose. Like most sunglasses they can scratch pretty easily, but the bag that comes with the order helps a lot. I think they're great and stylish. Love em!!"
2,"Godd for fashion, bad for eyes","Fashio wise, it is a nice pair of aviators. It came with a few minor scratches and was slightly small even for a small person like me.Other than looking good, they were crappy sunglasses. Dont block out glare at all."
2,Cheap Sunglasses,"Ok, not what i expected, they're super dark and flimsy, but it's what i get for payin $3 for sunglasses. Also they're suppose to come with a ""Microfiber Sunglasses Pouch"", which i didn't get. If you need some dark sunglasses then these will work, but be careful, they are flimsy."
5,Super Cool Shades,"The shades came on the 15th of January and they were suppose to come on the 19th through the 22nd of January. Shipping was fast! Shades were in good condition. Boxed in a careful manner, came with a bag to store the shades, totally worth your money. You can wear them with just about anything."
5,UB Silver Frame and Mirrored lens Aviator w/Drawstring Sunglass Pouch,Cool looking glasses. I can look at the girls without them really knowing it and people watch too!
5,"nice color, sturdy gold",These earrings are a very nice color swiss blue. The gold is sturdy. The earrings are worth the money.
4,"Pretty, and Pretty Sparkly","I bought these for my daughter-in-law, who is a soldier in the Army. She can wear earrings with her uniform, as long as they are post/studs and don't dangle. Well, these fit the bill to a tee! They are a good size, are sparkly, nicely feminine, and a really good price. Thanks, Amazon!"
5,"Large but not garish, good color and settings. Good value.","Nice Swiss blue color, good sized at 7 mm diameter - about the size of a flat thumb tack head - large but not garish. The settings are just what we wanted: white gold that does not tarnish like silver. Delivered in small velvet pouch inside a dark blue jewelry box, perfect for giving as a simple, moderately priced jewelry gift."
5,These earrings are just beautiful,"I saw these listed in a friday sale and couldn't pass them up. They are about the size of a thumb-tack (the flat, smaller side) and are brilliant blue in color. They are really light, delicate (yet solidly built) and are a great deal. The only possible issue I have is that the setting is higher than I expected and the base of the post is small in diamater (bigger bases sit better on your earlobe). But if that doesn't bother you, these earrings are a fine addition to any collection. Two thumbs up, I'm very happy with my purchase."
5,Great Gift,"Excellent presentation, nice gift box, with pouch inside. The earrings are very clean and beautiful. They will look great with my girlfriend's blue eyes."
4,"""Vestigial Medieval Coda""","A subtitled drama of clannish taboos and sudden violence in the rural countryside of a little known Eastern European society. Much to its credit, this film employs excellent pacing and convincing acting to illustrate how vestigial medieval coda can still upturn the life of a modern day agricultural community. It is, by turn, entertaining, disturbing and loaded with cultural insights."
5,Rockin' Zydeco,"The Delta gave birth to the Blues. Southwest Louisiana gave birth to the Zydeco. One of the traditional families in this music style are the Carriers. ""Dance All Night"" is an excellent CD to introduce you to this music. This music is fast, and when you here it you won't want to set down. Chubby's CD ranges from the Clifton Chenier French Zydeco Classic ""Tule Ton Son Ton"" to a verion of Bob Wills' country classic ""Stay a Little Longer"" and Blues standards by B. B. King, ""Rock Me Baby"", and Bobby Bland's ""Turn on Your Love Life"", as well as original material.Give it a try, if you have eclectic taste in music, you won't regret it.And if you ever have a chance to see Chubby Carrier and Bayou Swamp Band, don't miss them."
3,Almost had it......,"Well researched. However, here is a case where one wants to seeinto an idea issues which are not there, namely Eve or Margo have gay tendencies. Where and why? All About Eve is simply a story of rivarly, and downright envy. This tendency, expecially from gays, where they think that whenever someone has a flamboyant character (Margo) he or she is gay. This book, though the topic is fun and intriguing, the author tends to personalize too much. Three pages of dialogue of his friends after watching the movie, and here one can sense that his friends are gay, is out of place. This could have been a fun book to read....as the watching of the movie."
3,Way too much about All About Eve,"One of the best films about Hollywood (okay, okay, it takes place in the theater, but look between the lines, people) gets the overblown treatment in this tell-all book. For every piece of very interesting information (Bankhead vs. Davis, Davis vs. Holmes, director vs. studio), there are pages and pages of information which, while key to the making of ""AAE"", read like the resumes of people who died two decades ago.Still, ""All About 'All About Eve'"" still manages to pull out a few surprises. If you are a hopeless Margo Channing fan, buy and enjoy. Otherwise, visit your the local library and skim through the pages."
2,Needed an editor!,"A few good tidbits here, but way too much extranneous gushing. And where were the proofreaders and copy editors? Here's one small example of an unfortunate mistake, on page 8: ""...Mankiewicz had just started All About Eve, a film that, while technically about Hollywood rather than Broadway, in fact amounted to exploratory surgery on the dysphoric underbelly of show business."" Of course he meant to say, ""while technically about Broadway rather than Hollywood...."" It's just one of dozens of examples of extreme sloppiness that casts doubt on the whole enterprise. Too bad, too -- this could have been a really great must-have book for all movie fans. Instead, it's really a wasted opportunity."
2,"All About Eve...and Bette, Anne, Celeste, and Marilyn","This book has a fun-sounding premise and, indeed, it does offer some fun and interesting tidbits about the making of one of Hollywood's wittiest films. This works well until the author starts throwing in suppositions and references to the film and alternative lifestyles. This is when the book bogs down and loses interest. It does, however, start to pick up again when he tells the story of Mary Orr and the real Eve. Altogether, not as much fun as I hoped it would be, but it does have a certain value for students and devotees of classic Hollywood."
2,Not much about Eve,"I had high expectations for this book. I love the move ""All About Eve"" and bought the book with the idea that it would have a lot of interesting background on the development of the movie, interaction between the actors, and an analysis of the movie's long appeal. While the book covered these topics, it wasn't with the depth or gravity that I had hoped for. There was a drawn-out ""sub-plot"" about the ""real"" Eve, which seemed superfilious and inconclusive. Those looking for a serious book about a good film won't find it here"
1,Dreck,"The lit-crit deconstructionist approach. All that ""sub-text"" about ""sexual ambiguity"" and ""S&M"". You might naively think that Eve (Anne Baxter) is interested in Bill because she makes a pass at him, but no ...Staggs has seen the movie too often, projected too many fantasies into it, subordinated the movie to an agenda. There is some interesting gossip, and a nice summary of the fates of the players. Noe of this makes up for Stagg's stretched and contorted logic or his slack prose.If you want to see the inside of the way a great movie is made read the book about the making of Psycho instead, or Memo From David O Selznick. If you want gossip read one of David Niven's books."
3,All the info you could possibly want...,"To put it simply, if you LOVE the film, ALL ABOUT EVE, you are going to love this book. If you're not gaga over the film, then this book has much more than you'll probably be interested in. Some chapters are what I bought the book for: true insight into the making of one of my favorite films. The history of the short story from which the film is based, and the chapter covering the creation of the stage version, APPLAUSE, are fascinating. The remainder of the book, however, contains much camp and personal opinion, more than fact. A different cup of tea for each individual reader. A mixed bag of style and content, but still a fun and worthwhile read. Bold, brassy and gossipy, written much in the style of the film it covers."
3,"Would be better, briefer!","Brevity may be the soul of wit (and Lord knows, ALL ABOUT EVE was full of wit), but this author seemed to have been striving to satisfy some colossal word count with this too-long look at the popular Bette Davis film. Certainly the casual movie enthusiast will tune out half way through while the more serious might keep plugging along, as I did, if they can tolerate some pretty far-fetched analysis. As for the few die-hards, I suppose they'll find this to be as delectable as a box of bon bons.Keep your dictionary handy, the author certainly did...along with an exhaustive bibliography of any-and-every possible ""Eve"" reference available. After a while, it all becomes too encyclopedic to be fun.Ironically, he criticizes Mankiewicz' own literary memories of ALLA BOUT EVE as ""meandering,"" but there is no better desription for this overreaching, overlong albeit well-intended book."
1,I never got my product,i have no review for this product because i never received it. i ordered a month ago. this was the first and last time i will order from amazon.com
3,Okay for Newer Folks,"This book is a pretty well written fast read. It does contain some interesting thoughts and tidbits, especially towards the end, which could be valuable to anyone. The problem is, if you're over 40 and have spent any significant time at the gym or in martial arts, you probably won't find alot of useful information here. There's alot of generalities which are not age specific and are well known to any excercise enthusiast. If you're fairly new to working out and/or the martial arts, this is probably a pretty decent book."
3,Good book for a novice martial artist,"This book would be good for a new martial artist. If you have been doing martial arts for any time, you can skip to about page 200 or find a different book. However, as with any martial arts writer worth their salt, there are some insightful nuggets here, if you are willing theo sift through the basic stuff."
3,"good for beginners, less so if you've been at it for a while","This has a lot of information for the over-40 person who's considering martial arts training, but if you're already involved, the book may have limited value.I found more details on the physical effects of ageing (what I was looking for) in Ted Weimann's Warrior Speed."
3,Expected more technical insight on aging...,"Although this book is very well written and is a great guide if you do not have any other martial arts technical book on your shelf, after reading the other reviews, I was expecting some more technical insight on the aging issue and on the specifics of over-40 training. This info is there but in my opinion it's rather superficial and introductory. More than 2/3 of the book feels like a ""beginner's guide"" on stretching, strength, speed and general training techniques that already exists on hundreds of other ""training guides"" with more detail, and that every Martial Arts practitionist already knows from experience."
3,Somebody get this guy a copyeditor!,"This book had its moments, but the writing needs a lot of cleaning up. In particular, the consistent misuse of ""it's"" was very distracting to me. Also, one of the pages repeated the last few lines from the previous page.I think that the author's advice is all right, but it's biased towards complete beginners and non-contact martial arts."
3,Do not send as a gift!,"We have not opened up the box and used this gift, but I just wanted to warn everyone out there that, when you order it, it arrives in a box that shows exactly what it is, with a gigantic picture on the box. This just ruined the Christmas surprise for our kids, so beware!"
3,Disappointed,"This game would be perfect if it was not so cheaply made. For over $90, I was very surprised at the quality. The ""ice"" is a thin piece of plastic-coated paper, and the plastic surface underneath it is flexible because of its flimsiness. But the 7-year old who received it liked it very much. I only received 2 pucks and the scorekeeper was missing the numbers. I was very disappointed."
4,"""Everything Old is New Again""","Keeping this short....After reading the positive reviews and parental memories of this game, I bought this Christmas gift for my 13 year old iPod Touch addicted boys. Just like the reviews said, far from arcade quality, but it still has the fun and intensity of the game that has survived the generations...And no plug or batteries. Now we're not a hockey family, but this game has been a good occasional break for the boys from the little screens attached to their hands. I would have rated it a 4 1/2 star, dinging it only because it is not as large or robust as the arcade game. But, worth the price. Enjoy."
4,Just what we wanted,"Very realistic and great fun to play. Rewards strategy and skill. My three-year-old grandson loves it, as do my wife and her 80 year old parents. Great for all ages.Make sure you DON'T put the curtains in the nets, because it keeps the puck from going in on good shots.Mine came with one broken leg, and even gluing didn't fix it, as it was broken at a stress point. Nonetheless, the remaining piece of the leg stays on mostly, going off only once every 20 or 30 minutes.You have to make sure the men are placed on their stems correctly (even the non-goalies are not interchangeable) and that the tracking is correct for the men. It's easy to self-diagnose and fix, so if the men are not tracking smoothly, make sure to assess the situation."
4,almost as good as the older version,"In an age where video games rule the day, this fun toy is a keeper. I used to play this when I was a kid. My father in law used to play this when he was a kid. In fact we played his a couple of years ago - but it was missing some pieces. We searched for parts but couldn't find any. The older version (40 years +) was more durable and made with stronger metal. This version is not so bad - though it just doesn't feel as heavy as the old one. It seems to be pretty durable, though the unit is made mostly of plastic and very thin metal. One thing that is better about this one is the players have more mobility making for less dead pucks. The goalie is more mobile as well. For someone who never has watched or played hockey, this is a fun game."
4,Great rainy day game,"Our boys, 13 and 10, have only played this for a day or so, having received it for Christmas. It appears quite well made for the size and price. We followed the ""additional tips"" for enhanced playing (like spraying the gear wheels and rods with silicone spray) and that improved playability. I think it will be a great addition to our basement family room -- we can handle the size, it's really quite sturdy, and is a handy ""pick up"" game for the two of them or when friends are over. We are happy with this purchase."
5,"Loved not only by son, but entire non-hockey family!","""Santa"" brought this for our son as a Christmas gift and he absolutely loved it. The entire family tool turns pairing up to play each other, and we ended up having a tournament over the weekend. It was easy to change the players out to his favorite teams, and our 5 year old plays with no problems."
4,Stiga Table Hockey,"Very Happy for this game as it was a Christmas gift for my grandchildren. I had the same game when I was younger,the detail work is very good. I was a little dissappointed in that the game board is more or less a thin sheet of plastic. I liked it better when the playing board was molded solidly with the side board of the hockey rink. Other than that,it is a great game for kids and adults alike. Im having as much fun as my grandchildren."
3,Flimsy but fun,"I used to have a game like this when I was a kid. Guests on the holdiay also had interesting comments/memories of playing the game as kids themselves. Great ""old-fashioned"" fun! Would recommend it as a gift for all ages. Thanks for promoting a quality product and providing timely delivery for the holidayBought this item as a gift for 8 year old nephew. Don't know who had more fun........my nephew, , his father or me. It was so ""heartwarming"" to see them all so excited about a gift that didn't need batteries or need to be hooked up to a computer or tv to use and enjoy. It is not super durable but still a lot of fun."
3,Not like the 1st ones made in the '70's,"I'm not busting on the game but...the top needed to be secured better with glue. The players sticks are too thin that sometimes the shot goes right over the puck...these misgivings were all ""tweaked"" by gluing the top down better as previously mentioned and by adding pieces of plastic onto the business end of the sticks with epozy so that better contact was made with the puck.Also, the pucks of old had a small ball bearing held within a hard plastin outter ring. You could maneuver that puck much, much better.All in all though, my grandkids have left the video games and are now becoming hockey legions. A great, fast moving game. Provides much happiness."
5,Best toy for Christmas,"Santa has come up with some winners in the past, but this was the best present of the year. Have had 4 guests over in past couple weeks and all eyes light up when they see this. Alot of fun. Took about 20 minutes to assemble and nothing difficult."
4,Great fun.,Arrived quickly. We enjoy playing it. It is very easy to put together. My son loves it! I would recommend.
5,Beautiful!,"We LOVE Tea Time. We look forward to it. It's a beautiful magazine and FULL of recipes and ""how to's"". The ads are places to get very rare and beautiful things. We've ordered exotic teas and beautiful China sets. I gave my sister a gift subscription...she thought it was the best gift she'd gotten in years...she LOVES it! Do yourself a favor and place your order."
5,Surprised by Content,"I kept getting cards to subscribe to Tea Time for about three years before I finally sent the card back. I thought it would be frilly and useless. I was very surprised by its content...pleasantly surprised! Not only does this magazine contain useful information on how to take tea, but also delicious recipes, interesting interviews, great ideas and fantastic articles about places to visit. Well written, beautiful photography, informative content, and an easy lay-out; Hoffman Media, thank you for providing some much needed grace and gentility to an otherwise coarse world! My home will never be without Tea Time!"
5,Tea Time Magazine,The magazine is excellent. Beautiful photography and great recipies. I'm also impressed with Amazon's/magazine's customer service as I received my first issue within 4 weeks' time.
4,A Good Read!,"Kevin C. Klinvex, Matthew S. O'Connell, and Christopher P. Klinvex present a guide to creating a more effective hiring process. They cover each step, from defining the job to hiring the best person. The book provides techniques for attracting the right employees through advertising and promotion. It also covers effective use of applications, interviews, testing, and background checks. This book is clear, well-organized, and easy-to-read. While some of the suggestions may be obvious to those who are experienced at hiring, they are presented in a careful, step-by-step way. We at getAbstract recommend this book to those involved in the hiring process in larger companies, from company owners and top managers to human resource professionals. Small business owners who wish to use more sophisticated hiring techniques may also find it useful."
2,"Title misleading - Only 50 not ""Over 75"" songs","The title is ""Over 75 Of Ireland's Favourite Tunes"". But there are only 50 tracks. The songs are good, but I feel a bit cheated. If I didn't feel swindled out of 25+ promised songs, I would have rated this a 4-star."
4,Early Mel Brooks,This is a great piece of Mel Brooks' early work. Dom Deloise shows early comedic ability.
5,One of the greatest movies no one has ever heard of.,"This is one of the very best movies ever made. It holds up over time and is fine for all audiences. Great dialogue, tremendous sight gags and just general genius brings this movie off of the screen and into your heart forever.Mel Brooks has made many funny movies but this one is perhaps his least known but maybe, just maybe his funniest movie of all."
2,OK film for Mel Brooks fan.,This is a very old movie; older than I had expected. The low rating is because I'm not a great fan of Mel Brooks.
2,Confused with a few good scenes,"I really expected to enjoy this movie more than I did, but it seemed confused. With only a handful of really amusing scenes, a strange relationship between the main characters, and a thin plot, the movie seemed confused: not a spoof, not really a satire of Soviet life, not quite a buddy picture. The humor bounced between understated to the point of boredom, mild satire, and slapstick which frequently stumbled past funny to merely manic.On the plus side, Dom Delouise produced some good laughs as the greedy priest. Mel Brooks was funny as Tikon the ex-servant who fawns over his old master. Also a young Frank Langella looks great for the ladies.Overall, not Brooks' best movie."
2,not one of his best,"Mel Brooks is probably my all-time favorite actor and director, but he really let me down on this movie. First of all, he doesn't appear in it. Secondly, okay, they are a few funny parts, but not many. If you want to see something funny, try his OTHER movies: Young Frankenstein, Spaceballs, Men in Tights, History of the World Part 1, Blazing Saddles, etc. Watch this movie if you have nothing better to do and you've seen all of his other movies."
1,"does not deserve to carry the title ""12 Chairs""","""Twelve Chairs"" is one of the greatest classics of Russian literature, the 1977 movie rendition of it (directed by Mark Zakharov) is simply an excellent movie. In comparison (and actually, even without one) this Mel Brooks film is simply pathetic. It is, actually, beyond me why Brooks would choose this poignantly satirical work for a slap-stick comedy. If this is the only version of ""12 Chairs"" that you have seen, or read, then you have no idea of what that book is all about."
2,Unbelievable and Unacceptable,"Don't get me wrong; me and my family LOVE this movie. But that has nothing to do with it.The DVD came on time (I think) and in a nice box. The problem was the case. It had this thick, dry, icky inky stuff dried on the plastic cover, obscuring the front cover underneath it. It was not just some little line of ink, it was despicable.I couldn't give that to my brother for his birthday, or he'd think it was used (even though it was shrink-wrapped, OVER the inky mess). So I opened it up, took out the front cover paper and CD, and put them in a new case.Seems I shouldn't be having to deal with or pay for this myself. Anyone who packaged this item should have been able to see it needed some attention. Get the movie; it's great. Just expect that you won't wanna judge this book by its cover."
2,NOT WHAT YOU'VE COME TO EXPECT FROM BROOKS,"The one reason I would tell someone not to rent this film or buy it is because there's not enough laughs! If you can believe that! Especially from MEL BROOKS! The story gets a bit BORING after a while. But this is not Brooks' fault! This movie is based on a old Russian novel entitled ""The Golden Calf"". There are some good points to the film though. This is Brooks' best directing effort. He shows great control has a director. The acting is SUPERB! Brooks even transforms Hugarian dance #5 by Brams,calling it ""Hope for the best....expect the worst!"" The title itself should bring on a smile. To bad there wasn't enough laughs!"
2,Rather Silly,Not what we have come to expect of Mel Brooks. High Anxiety is a much funnier movie. The story line is the same as a movie made some years ago (Its In the Bag which is available on Netflix) starring Fred Allen and Jack Benny. I don't know who copied it from who.
5,A family favorite,"This is an underappreciated gem. A great story with a depth of character not often provided by Brooks' films. While growing up in the 70's our famly watched this almost yearly. Great over-the-top performances by Dom DeLuise, Ron Moody and a great bit part by Mel Brooks. Frank Langella's part is well done as a handsome and sly con man. Only one short ""non-family friendly"" scene in the very beginning. Otherwise great for all ages."
1,wrong code,"When I received the movie i realized that it wouldn't play in my DVD player because in USA they have a different code - as they do in almost everything due to their foolish need to be different from the rest of the world. So I haven't seen the movie yet, I'm waiting for a professional to change the code.Anazon should have told me of the different country code between USA and the rest of the world."
4,GREAT!,"Product could not have been better..however, I emailed the company that was selling the book- three times and never once received a response! This created a lot of stress for me!Book was excellent condition and product arrived between the dates listed in Amazon!"
3,Excellent service,"I hate to admit this, but I realized 6 weeks into a college course that I had purchased the wrong textbook. I had an assignment due in two days and in sheer panic was able to locate this book on the Amazon textbook rental website. Yes, I spent extra money to have it shipped overnight, but I had my textbook THE NEXT DAY !! Amazon saved the day !!"
1,"very cheap printing, not worth $80!","Textbooks are notoriously expensive already, but hopefully this is not a new trend! For $80 one should at least receive a readable-size print edition of a book, but Health Policy and Politics 4th edition is tiny! While its small size makes it easy to carry, it's print [10 font?] makes it impossible to read easily or for long without getting a headache. If I could switch to another college offering this course using a different textbook, I would do it."
2,Boring,"Book is a little too wordy and extremely dry. Only purchased as requirement for health policy class. Will most likely not keep after class is over. Also, barely even used for class."
3,Lesser Dick,"The recurrence of the theme of the discovery of living ancient ancestors in modern times, as in Dick's The Man Whose Teeth Were All Exactly Alike and The Simulacra, suggests a symbolic incursion into modern consciousness of the buried, primitive self. But despite flashes of the author's characteristic humor, The Crack in Space is substandard PKD. It relies on routine political intrigue and a meandering plot without compelling characters. Except for Jim Briskin, the first black man ever to run for president, there seem to be none who are not mired down in petty, personal, materialistic concerns. This novel also lacks both the themes of the problematical marriage and the breakthrough to a higher reality that mark much of Dick's best work. Probably only those who have read just about everything else Dick wrote need seek this one out."
4,contemporary bluesman,"Studebaker John is an interesting, entertaining musician. He writes, sing, and plays (harmonica and slide guitar) original songs, but with a style that is obviously influenced by the Chicago blues. When friends want an introduction to contemporary blues, I have them listen to Too Tough; it has never disappointed. I recommend checking out Too Tough over the later releases because I think the overall consistency of songs is higher on this album."
3,Good R&B blues,This was the first major release for Studebaker John on Blind Pig. You will do better to check out his subsequent releases.This is a reasonable good album if you like good old R&B blues. The highlights of the offering are when he plays both harp and guitar. The best tracks are 'Someboby forgot to tell my heart' and 'Boogie walk'. He offers a clean uncomplicated style and seems to suffer from under-exposure. His subsequent albums provide many more highlights.
3,"hmong means free? attractive, but NOT accurate!",Hmong means free is an inacurrate phrase... it is unfair to label hmong in such a way because Hmong are attracted by the phrase and repeat it when it is untrue...
1,Hmong means free,"I just want to say something about the two words Hmong and Meo because many people seem to misunderstand.""Hmong"" is what the Hmong called themselves long ago during Fishing & Gathering, agrarian, and horticulture civilization. On the other hand, ""Meo"" is what the Chinese named the Hmong due to prejudice and discrimination result from war: Chinese battled with the Hmong during pre-industrial society in the late 1700s.Tou B. YAng"
1,hmong mean free,"Who the hell is this guy...hmong does not mean free..i think this Dr. dude should rewrote his dang book. What proud and evidence does he have which tell hmong mean free. How disrespect the author of this book. those who agree that hmong mean free..well, open your eyes and see how hmong live like as today."
1,Buy Geography Bee Demystified to complement this book.,"This book is ok for to get through school level along with another book like ""1001 Questions."". To get to the next level, and win the state and the national bee, you really need to get ""Geography Bee Demystified"" and the ""Handy Geography."" Geography Bee Demystified is a new book and has stuff from 2007 and does not cost a lot more than this book."
1,Bad,"This fan did not work well from the first minute I took it out of the box. The motor would constantly slow down to almost a stop, then start up again. The mechanism for holding the blades was weak and the fan shook and vibrated constantly."
4,Fantastic!,"Even though the episodes on these DVDs are only 30 min each and should be reduced to one volume, I still think it is a worthwhile investment. The animators did not sterilize the Tales for kids with oversensitive parents, which is greatly appreciated. My kids love these and ask to watch them all the time. I don't know what the seller is thinking that has just volume one listed for $250, though. I bought all three volumes on sale for $59 from Schlessinger (normal price is $120, I think). So, get them - but not from that guy."
1,Not worth the money,"This book is not worth the money or the time, its so jumbled i didn't even want to finish it....Dont wast your time"
1,even in your own review,"""The book is the truth. I wrote it for closer and to heal the pain.""Published on May 8, 2006 by Margaret GomezThis is why an editor is so important. Do you mean you wrote it for closure? This could have been a great book with some help from a professional. It probably would have sold a lot more as well. I really feel for you but if you want to put something out to the consumer, make sure it is checked for consistency and errors."
1,Needed an editor,"Although I feel sympathy to the author and her plight, I feel I wasted my money on this book which I couldn't wait to read. The actual reading time took all of ten minutes, yes I do tend to read fast however, I was hoping that for $7.95 I would get a novel I could sink my teeth into and not read in moments. There was no order to the book she seemed to flop all over the place, there were sentences that made no sense, sentence fragments, numerous points of repetativeness and questioning of the readers ex. What do you think of that? If the book were written better, had more depth to it and fleshed out a little it might be a worthy of the $7.95 cover price."
1,Not what I expected,"This book was not well written. It jumped back & forth through time in a disjointed, confusing manner & some topics were repeated over & over."
4,What a difference!,"I canned the other album ""Tales from the AustinMotel"" as sweet studio plastic muzik. It's difficult to believethis is from the same artist! Real blues feel, much more laid back licks, great vocals. I don't think Eric will feel too threatened in spite of the optimistic rewiewer from ""Music Connection"" ""Davies exhibits guitar playing virtuosity with the likes of Eric Clapton and Stevie Ray Vaughan"" Well they are certainly entitled to think that, but I think Ms Davies real strength is in her voice, good guitar, great voice!"
5,This lady kicks.....Female Eric Clapton...,"Another break in the glass ceiling of Texas Roadhouse blues.. This lady can rock. One of her better performances but nothing beats a live show. When she turns on the gas, she smokes the place. Technically, most guys can not compete in fret work."
4,Picture This,"I didn't know who Debbie Davies was until I heard a song on the radio ""Better Off With The Blues"". Result: ordered this great albumn. All the songs are ""crank up"" material. Will order more of her albumns for sure!!"
3,GP plugging away,"Here and there, there are some strong songs - Release Me, Love Is A Burning Question, and Here It Comes Again especially stand out. Interesting songs throughout. Nice being re-introduced to Joe Meek. Mr. Tender is the surprise overly-sentimnetal song which might have fit better (and dramatically improved) 12HE."
4,Worked for me...,"I have not personally had a problem with this company at all.I have used both the little teethers and the little noses nasal spray on my baby and on myself with success.The teething gel is, in my opinion, nearly comparable in strength to baby orajel and to me it tastes better. However, it does seem that they do not give much of the product per tube. It is also quite thick even if you do not refrigerate it, which makes it a bit more tricky to spread."
1,Very poor quality image,"Purchased this before my family is really big into the Bee Gees, and as I get older I tend to like their music more also. After popping this into the Blu Ray player, I was horrified to see that the quality was just so poor. Trust me, I've bought several other Blu Ray concerts and this is the worst I've ever seen. It's not even close to HD, so pass on this product or buy it on dvd."
3,not so good,i expected more of this dvd because it is just like a documental of their life with no much music
2,"Good, But Not Great","I have always enjoyed Rodriguez'works, both on stage and in movies (with the notable exception of ""Bloodwork,"" where he plays an unfunny and thankless part; but a guy has to work, que no?). I bought this CD, assuming that it would be as funny as his other works. But it isn't. There are certainly places in the CD where he made me smile or laugh a little, but there is no section that causes me to lose it, laughing-wise. It seems rather strident, as if he is trying too hard. A great comedian makes you laugh and laugh over. Rodriguez' trying too hard to be funny makes me feel uncomfortable, to the point where I don't care to listen to it again.If you are Mexican-American, as I am, or if you just want to lose it and laugh until you're crying, try the CD's by George Lopez, ""Team Leader"" or ""Right Now, Right Now."" I have listened to them over and over, and they're just as funny as the 1st time I heard them! George Lopez is the true heir to Cheech Marin."
4,"Great Comedy, Very Original...... but based on events of the 1980's.","This CD is very funny. It gives a view of representing between Latinos and the rest of America. However it is old, as the jokes are based on events of the 1980's, it is still very funny with the Latino views of the American Way of Life."
5,What a Gift!,"This coffee table sports offering has no weak spots. Cover-to-cover...SOLID. I found it to be the perfect business gift for the sports enthusiast. I am not a shill for SI or Amazon but,it's also very efficient. This is my 5th order."
4,Nation Within A Nation: The Rise of Texas Nationalism,"Texans have often been viewed by other Americans-indeed, the World-as ""a bit different."" Mark Nackman's NATION WITHIN A NATION goes a long way in explaining this phenomenon. Nackman traces the development of Texas nationalism during its time as a provence of Mexico, a republic, and a state in the Union. As a republic, Texas (the only state that can claim a previous existance as an independent nation) essentially developed its own peculiar ""nationality"" which is still very much in existence today. This is a well researched, scholarly book that will appeal to readers interested in Texas history and the development of Texas culture."
3,Read and Decide for Self,"I have just discovered this author. Historically, the story was on point. Ms. Riley knows her history. She gets a 5 star for being well read. The primary problem I had was the story line wasn't fully developed. There were many places that lacked a transition from one idea to the other or time period.It is not a bad read at all. The story line should have been more developed. I say read it for yourself. This author has great potential. She knows history. She get mad points from me just for that.I have read everything on the Buffalo Soldiers, The 9th and 10th."
5,Best Book For Any Teenage Girl,I read this book and literally could never put it down. I remember how hard it is to go to school and to act cool. I would definitely reccomend this book to anyone.
5,As advertised,I needed to replace the rechargeable batteries in one of my portable land line phones. These batteries extended the time the phone can remain off of the charger significantly.
1,"cannot hold charge, get sanyo eneloop instead","I have used sanyo eneloop's for a few years, but thought I'd try these sony's because they claim to be have higher mAh's than the eneloop's.The eneloop's will last 10-11 hours in my MP3, but the Sony's last anywhere from 8 minutes to 50 minutes. We've charged them 4 times with the same result. If the vendor will not take them back, we will throw them out, it's just too much hassle to change batteries in the middle of exercising, etc. all the time. Our charger is a Panasonic BQ-390, which is an excellent smart charger.Don't waste your time with these Sony batteries."
1,Brown spot looking like leakage around contact,"Had my 4 Sony CycleEnergy AA battery for a little over a year now and have only recharged it 3 times . Most of the time the batteries was in stored in a zip lock bag placed away in a dry place. When I took the Sony batteries out of the zip lock bag today, all had brown spots seeping out near the battery contact area out. I think battery acid is leaking out of the battery. Very poor quality especially if the battery was charged only 3 times and most of the time it wasn't even being used. My other brands of rechargeable was stored in the same bag and had no signs of the problem. It was a waste of money and time since now I have to go out and purchase an alternative replacements."
3,Good but missleading,This is a good collection of films but the Queen only has a staring role in two of them. In the third film she's just a supporting actress at best.
3,Necessary coinage,"Kurtz coined the word ""eupraxophy"" to distinguish Secular Humanism from belief systems usually considered ""religions."" Eupraxophy accepts the best ethical principles of historical philosophies and religions, but disentangles them from the superstitions of theism (e.g., Christianity), while combining them with the pursuit of rigorous philosophical and scientific inquiry, which is missing in Eastern ethical systems like Confucianism and Buddhism.Critics have complained that ""eupraxophy"" is hard to pronounce, and in his later writings Kurtz has been spelling it with an extra ""s,"" as in ""eupraxsophy."" But I don't see why its pronounciation with the original spelling is any harder than pronouncing ""saxophone."" This book is a significant contribution to our understanding and classification of worldviews, though it could benefit from a discussion of more recent eupraxophies like Objectivism and Transhumanism."
3,A good italian wine,"... and as such an acceptable entertainment, but the after-taste is missing. The story tries to depict a normal family of four, living each its own separate life and pursuing their own individual dreams. The tension between their own routines and realities and what they would like to be makes them explode, one by one, and hit the wall, to come back again to reality and family unity at the end.Some sort of fairy tale, actors and scenography are very good, emotions are openly ventilated - as in any good italian movie worth its name -, and a lot of scenes have real credibility.But when the film is over, without the emotions, the scenography, the great looks of Valentina and the uncertain end of each of the four little stories, very little is left, and the whole exercise shows its superficiality. Just a good italian wine ..."
4,"Simple, honest and beautiful movie","It could be that the the bottle of Pinot that I had along with the movie that me biased, but I don't think so.Keeping up with the best traditions of Italian cinema, this movie engrosses the viewer with its simple, yet very realistic dialog, characters and plot.Through the scenes we experience the characters longing for the very basic human happiness. Each of them, is different and seeks a happiness of different form. But ultimately, they all are looking for the same thing."
4,Another in the Elements of Fiction Writing Series,"Great coverage on the use of description in detail, plot, style, point of view, and Word Selection. Nine chapters, 168 pages of tips for developing stories, and description techniques. Moncia Wood uses example, stories, and sample works of well known authors to get her points across. She provides alternative for word choice and tips for self editing. And excellent writing reference guide."
5,Number one,"The best writing book I ever read. This may sound strange, but I couldn't put this book down. It is filled with example after example on what bad descriptions vs. good and great descriptions look like and how to write them. I would highly recommend this book to any one who likes writing."
3,"Not Terrible, Not Great","This it one of those books that I can neither thing of a real good reason to recommend it, nor can I think of a good reason to tell people to avoid it, so it gets three stars. Monica Wood covers the topic fairly well and has some good suggestions, but there isn't much unique matterial in the book. As I read, I found myself skipping sections of the book and I don't feel that I miss anything by doing so. She has some different views about some things than other authors, most notably the ""show, don't tell"" rule. But few authors agree on that rule. She seems to have more of a character driven approach to writing, so if you do also then you may find her book more helpful than one written by someone with a plot based approach. The occassional jewels that are scattered throughout the book make it worth buying for many people, but others may find it difficult to read."
3,Okay to Consult,"I have an earlier version of this book, with a different cover. This is an okay book for a writer or would-be writer to consult, but I don't think the organization is well-thought-out. Much of it seems overly basic, more like a book on how to write fiction than a book on how to write description. The fact that the chapters have titles such as ""Description and Dialogue"" and ""Description and Point of View"" indicates that description is being dealt with in pieces. It's possible to read all these pieces and not come away with a comprehensive picture of how to write description. The best book on description is ""Word Painting: A Guide to Writing More Descriptively,"" by Rebecca McClanahan."
2,Fluffy and elevated - not for writers with a story to tell,"Nothing in this book was usable for me. Okay, very little. If I was trying to write the next _Ethan Frome_, then this book would be perfect. Instead I write sci-fi and fantasy. I was looking for tips to improve my description of things; this book recommends describing different things. Too much emphasis on metaphor (which is a wonderful tool but a tad obvious). If you want to write in a way people might actually communicate, this book might be a waste of your time. HOWEVER, poets and pure-literary writers might find it more useful than I did."
5,understandable education,This is my third book on writing. Having decided to study in my quest to write fiction and without formal universities available I settled on home study. As I read into her book I became extremely satisified with what I was learning.Her descriptions are simple and followed with good examples. I strongly recommend her book to all desiring to improve their intellectual understanding of creative writing.
4,A must for any fiction writer!,"As someone who enjoys feeling as if I'm part of the story, I found this book to be a very detailed, very informative how-to. Through extensive examples, Wood leads the writer through the pitfalls and the perks of using description. If you've already read other books on the subject, you will find some things repeated here, but take a look anyway. By choosing passages to make a point or by rewriting a passage several times, Wood's view is inciteful and fresh. As a fiction writer myself I would strongly recommend it to any one who wants to bring their world to life."
4,A Recommendable Recording,"On this disc, the technical ability of Nelson Freire is clearly demonstrated as can be seen in the Symphonic Etudes by Schumann. His rendering of Chopin's Impromptu is marvelous especially in the thunderous octaves in the middle section. In the Andante Spianato and Grand Polonaise by Chopin, I find a moving spianato and a heroic polonaise. On the whole, his running passages are mostly clean and crystal clear. Therefore, this recording is a must to all piano music lovers and is also a recommendable recording to all piano students and to all amateurs."
3,"Very light weight, almost too much...","Mine finally broke after a year. The complaints about the rechargeable batteries and the display are accurate, but I still miss mine. The sound was fabulous - but if you move to fast/bounced it at all it would skip easily. Still, I used it mainly, plugged in with the DC adapter at my bedside to listen to audiobooks as I fell asleep. For this it was perfect. The back lighting on the wired remote display was great in the dark and, yes, harder to read in the daylight. I would purchase it again, if it were a $50.00 item, but not at $80- $90.Panasonic SL-CT730 - CD / MP3 player"
1,Frustrating!,"I have 3 of these clocks distribted around my house. Like other reviewers here, the second hand in one of them freezes up. I take out the battery, it starts up just fine then runs normally for a day or two, then freezes up all over again. So you take your chances with this item, get a good one and you are all set. Get a bad one and you're faced with the issue of packing up a 16"" clock, getting it to a P.O. and then shelling out some hard earned cash, to keep your fingers La Crosse(d) to get it either fixed properly or receiving a new one which doesn't have this same d****d problem."
1,"Poor product quality, even wolrse customer service","The product never worked properly. Specifically, the hour hand would not show the correct time. After weeks of emailing customer service, the company requested I pay for shippping for service. Instead I threw the clock away. Poor quality, worse customer service. Avoid this company."
2,Works for a while,"I own two of these clocks purchased elsewhere and both of them have second hands that stopped working. Taking the battery out is supposed to start the second hand again, but it just advances 20 seconds and freezes again. Both clocks sometimes go crazy when the time changes and the hands move around the clock continuously without stopping. Forgot to mention that I returned another for being DOA. A very poor design."
3,Atomic clock,"I like this clock for its looks, its accuracy, with one big exception. The clock has not adjusted to the new dates on daylight saving time. I bought two of these clocks for our church and every time the time changes, the clocks change to the old schedule and we are constantly stopping well meaning people from changing the incorrect time. We just have to wait several weeks for the time to align with the not so new changes in daylight saving time. I sure wish there was some way to fix this, but I know it can't be done on the purchaser side, the manufacturer needs to get on the ball."
5,"Great clock, very big..","Installed in my garage, it's the first thing I see on the way in and the last on the way out. It and my att wireless phone's time are always in sync. You'll want to read the manual though. The first time you put the battery in, you'll set the time zone and daylight savings buttons on the back. After that, it will wait until late at night to sync. Don't expect it to set immediately. Once set, all you need to do is replace the battery once or twice a year, push a couple buttons and you're good. I bought two of the 12"" versions for inside the house. They work flawlessly as well. The only thing I'd avoid is leaving the 16"" version laying face up with the battery in. The second hand is heavy enough that the tip will drag on the paper backing which in my case, resulted in an arc where the second had dragged. This isn't an issue when the clock is mounted though."
4,Atomic Clock,"I love this clock. It keeps perfect time, and is very stylish. It is simple to set up, and is a great addition to my office. I received it in less than the quoted time."
4,"Great clock, after hands were properly aligned.","would have rated this 5 stars except the hands did not align properly at any time. Clock goes into reset mode and hands go to 12:00 when battery is inserted. once it aquires signal, about 2 minutes, it sets itself to correct time. at reset, minute and hour hands were way off. removed back, several screws, and the retaining clips to expose the hands, did a reset, and when it stopped moving, i manually moved all hands to the 12:00 position. began reassembly, and clock acquired signal and reset itself before I had finished. Now keeps great time. Instructions say they ship with a locking pin to keep hands from moving during shipment, it did not have one. It was an inconvenience to correct, but its a great clock and I am very happy with it."
5,Love the book,"I bought this book for my little nieces, whom I watch during the week.They love the book, mostly for personal reasons - I carry the baby, ELIZABETI carries her baby; our baby is Eva, THE DOLL is Eva - but I love the book just because it's a very sweet story.It has simple enough wording, only a few sentences per two-page spread, that it can be read easily to a young child, only two years or so... and it has a deep enough story that it will be enjoyed by an older child as well.There's only one part of the book that strikes me as strange, and that's at the very end. Elizabeti's mother thinks to herself that Elizabeti will be a good mother when she grows up... and then we're told that Eva (the doll/rock) thinks so too. The style of the book is so realistic that it's a strange note, because, of course, dolls and rocks don't think. But I can always edit or skip that line, so it's not a problem."
4,Nice low profile ceiling fan,"Install was simple enough. First ceiling fan I have ever installed and everything went smoothly. Followed the included directions, easy enough. Great addition to my room. Also installed a wireless remote with thermostat control with the fan (Westinghouse 7787400 Thermostat Ceiling Fan and Light Remote Control for Fans, http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000N1DM9M/ref=oh_details_o04_s01_i00) and works perfectly. I think this combo will save me money on heating / cooling, probably pay for itself in a few years."
2,Horrible,"I've been a fan of RHCP for a long time, but this is just a really bad album.No one can deny that RHCP isn't the worlds greatest live band. Anthony Kiedis is off key almost all the time, he has improved on this record though. John Frusciantes guitar is just annoying and very thin sounding, especially when Flea is playing his thin sounding bass. The album lacks bass, and bottom end. Chad Smith's performance is solid, and Flea does the job, still with his thin sounding bass.And then there's the setlist! As someone else mentioned, there's only 2 songs from ""Blood Sugar Sex Magik"", and none from albums before that. What happened to ""Me and My Friends"", ""Breaking The Girl"", ""Suck My Kiss"", ""Fire"", and the master cover of Stevie Wonders ""Higher Ground""? There's way too many songs from ""By The Way"", and almost no funk at all. It's a shame.I looked at the setlist from their 2001 DVD ""Off The Map"", and it features a fair mix of songs from their amazing career."
3,"It's ok, not amazing...","This is the only live-album of the Chili Peppers and I expected a little more. It has 26 songs divided in two cd's, including songs from Blood Sugar, Californication and By the Way albums, some covers and some inedit songs. I think the problem is the audio quality, it seems that this album had a little post-production work, so I didn't fell the energy that you expect from a Chili Pepper's concert. The booklet only have some photos of the band on tour. I recommend this album only for truly fans, I prefer the Live At Slane Castle or the Off The Map Dvds better than this one. =D"
5,awesome live album,"I bought this a few months ago, figuring it would be unavailable eventually, as most import live records are. It's great, I'm glad I bought it."
4,Brilliant,"I loved this book. I have never seen such a huge compilation of ideas from so many different topics compiled into one place. Not only that, but all the topics interlink to show the obvious as well as subtle connections. I especially like the fact that throughout the book, the authors manage to show numerous points of view, but without trying to force the reader to fall into any specific belief. I'll admit that not all the ideas are original in this book, but that fact is even stated within the book. For a second-year chemical engineering major such as myself, this was a real inspiration for thinking ""out of the box"", and really made me think about some of the ""knowns"" tought in science. A deffinite must. I have several friends in line to borrow this book already!"
2,McScience,"I think the only section of this book that is truly informative is the list of reference material at the end of it. While the audience of the book is geared towards your average Joe, there is an incredible amount of uncritical examples without strong direct reference to actual scientific work. I'm speaking specifically of DNA. While the authors spend a lot of time showing that DNA isn't a simple blueprint, I found their explanations lacking in attempting to come up with an alternative theory, one that didn't seemed to be well engaged with other contemporary thought.That said, the authors seem quite aware of the breadth of content in the fields this book writes about. If you're looking for a great list of primary works, I would definitely consult their section on further reading (it's not labeled 'Works Cited' or 'Bibliography')."
3,Not for me,"I can't say I enjoyed this, hard as I tried. I think the basic point they're trying to make is rather simple, but it didn't come across that way. I've read lots of stuff by Dawkins, Pinker, Ridley and others, but for me, the explanations and analogies here didn't work, and the fun bits weren't especially fun. I don't know if that says more about me or the writers, but I won't be looking for more books by them.This was the first book I bought for my Kindle and I started thinking I didn't like the reader, that I prefer paper books. Later purchases have shown me it's this particular book that was getting me down, not the machine.Also, the number of typos and poor quality of diagrams here was really irritating."
1,"This is a workbook, not a textbook!","Please be careful when you order this book! It does not state it in the advertising, but this is ONLY the workbook, NOT the textbook! Amazon says they do not carry the textbook."
5,Awesome book!,"Obi-Wan is so sweet. Giving up what he worked so hard for because he believes in the cause. I don't know if I could do that. He has guts. Poor Qui-Gon. He's disappointed. The bad thing is that Obi-Wan did just what Qui-Gon was hoping he wouldn't. How tragic! I don't know what else to say, except that I haven't found a better Star Wars series of any kind. Keep up the good work. (It would just be helpful if they had at least 150 pages) I can't stand waiting for ""The Uncertain Path"" to get to bookstores. It's killing me. I want to know what happens. Anyway, it's a great book and you're seriously mistaken if you don't read it; no matter how old you are!"
5,The end? No Way!,"What? That was the most surprising ending that I have ever read in a book. In a way I can understand what Obi-Wan was thinking, but to just do what he did was unthinkable! Well, now that I think about it, I probably would have done the same thing. But poor Qui-Gon, I can only imagine how terrible he felt during that. Stupid Obi-Wan! Hey Jude, hurry up with the next one. We are all waiting."
5,I devoured this one!!!,It's great to see I'm not the only over the recommended age reading level (I'm 34). I was absolutely spellbound by this book and could hardly put it down! I ached right along with Qui-Gon as Obi-Wan struggled with his beliefs. Their relationship is developing at a good pace. And I can't believe we're left hanging until January!Thanks Jude for another wonderful episode in the lives of two of our favorite Star Wars characters!
4,MUST GET NEXT BOOK,"I really love all the JA books! I don't have very many of them yet, only #'s 1,2,3, and 5. I plan on buying the other ones ASAP. But, about the book: this book is a really good book but it made me cry at the end. I think its SOOOO sad the way that Obi-Wan leaves the Jedi. I am hoping they get back together in later books. This book is great except for the ending and the way Obi-Wan betrays Qui-Gon's trust. I won't say anymore except that if Jude Watson reads these she needs to know that the 2 Jedi shouldn't be seperated any longer than possible."
5,I HATE endings like this!,"I LOVE Obi Wan, but in this case I found myself SCREAMING at him! I have read better books in this series! At least w/ a better ending. My friend and I were also screaming at Neild and Cerisai for making Obi-Wan go through w/ it! Anyway, I have a HUGE crush on Mr. Kenobi! I have been a Star Wars fan since I first saw it when I was 5. 7 years and I have never read such a great series! But, if you love Obi-Wan, I recommend you prepare yourself!"
4,What? That's the end!,I could not believe the ending! And I could not believe Obi-Wan. This is for all those people who were cruel to Qui-Gon for his behavior in book #1: OBI-WAN IS A BUTTHEAD! >: ( How could he betray his Master like that?
4,You're never too old for Star Wars,"First, I have to say that I'm in college, and I still like to read this stuff. Although the plot and writing are simplistic, the characters are wonderfully drawn. I really enjoyed delving into this book, and can't wait for the next. All the characters act in logical ways, even if it brings them to an impasse at the end"
4,"Great for on the go, or at home!!!","I think that this product is well worth the money! I love the nose sucker (as we call it). It has an insertion guard so that you can't put it too far in the baby's nose. I love the nail clippers also. There is enough extra room in the case to put a bottle of infants tylenol, or advil. The only thing that I don't like is the thermometer. Mine takes FOREVER to beep. I got another one for my baby shower, also made by The First Years that has an insertion guard for taking temperature rectaly. I have this one in my kit instead. Other than that, very easy to put in a diaperbag, convienient handle on the top, and great products inside!"
5,The bulb makes it all worth it!,"I really like how organized this set is. The one thing that I absolutely love is the bulb because there is no way to stick it in too far and it cleans easily by opening the top and then rinsing the inside with soap and water. There are alot of emory boards for filing baby nails and the clippers are absolutly safe. I have not yet used the other things but really, the bulb is the greatest thing in the world. Even if the other stuff ends up being worthless, I'd just go out and buy a better model to put in it's place. The case is pretty useful, you can even fit a small bottle of medicine in it."
4,Fun with a good meaning behind the lyrics,"In one line: A Fun Techo/Scat/Jazz compliation from ScatmanDon't listen to the buffoons who say the tracks all sound the same, it's like saying any other artists tracks ""all sound the same"". Every track on this CD is unique and has something to capture your interest, make you think, laugh, or both. _AND_ to Mr. Reviewer below - READ about this guy, he was helping kids who stuttered just like him, he wasn't doing for money...geez you're shallow :P"
1,he really was a one-hit-wonder...,"Scatman John proves with this album that his hit ""Scatman"" was the only real catcher to come out of his repetoire ... The album is vague and revolves around the same I-need-some-money-so-I'll-write-a-hopeless-song theme. I strongly recommend you DON'T buy this..."
3,Minor but enjoyable Oliveira,"A minor but enjoyable movie by the almost centenary Portuguese director. The movie starts with a beautiful shot of the waves breaking at the rocks of some cliff in the Portuguese coast. The film is basically about two couples, a young one and an old one (the lovely - and Oliveira regular - Leonor Silveira, Rogerio Samora, Michel Piccoli and Irene Papas) in two extended sequences. The first sequence happens in a garden party of some sort by the sea that is interrupted by a storm, the other happens some time later in a castle. The second sequence shows an argument of some sort between the couples, involving an incident that happened in the first sequence. This is a talky movie, but more than the particular dialogues what one remembers about it is the slow but beautiful cinematic rhythm of Oliveira."
1,Mop pole broke right away!,"I was SO excited to get this kit and do a number on my hardwood floors, but when it arrived and I started putting together the pole, I saw signs of trouble. The mop pole itself is actually NOT easy to fit together, and the kit comes w/ no instructions! It might seem easy, but the fittings that keep the pole together are made of plastic and resemble screw-like fittings, but they really don't fit together perfectly and if you press to hard, they'll snap and break. You'd think you could just snap them in and go, but noooooooooooo! Then once you finally get them in right, any pressure on the mop itself and the pole is unsteady and acts like it could break.....which it did. After one use. SO bummed..."
1,Mop broke on first use,"I had purchased this at a local Home Depot and before using it had checked out the reviews here, so I knew the mop had problems. Even being careful, it broke on its first use. You'll wind up using the mop end like a squeegee. This can actually be effective, as it allows you spray and wipe fairly quickly... on your hands and knees, which isn't what I paid for. Very poor quality mop and I'm unimpressed about the cleaning solution."
1,Mop handle inferior quality,"The cleaning solution does a good job, but is available at Costco for half the price paid here. I definitely recommend the cleaning pad. It does an excellent job and is easy to clean.The mop handle was an expensive waste of money. It broke immediately, with very little pressure applied. To their credit, the company did send me a new, better quality mop handle. However, the handle did not fit the applicator head. Another waste of money."
1,Very unhappy with results,I bought this product at a Lowes store in hopes to get more of a shine and less of a dull appearance. The product left my 5 year old floors dull I was very upset.
4,beautiful wood floor,"my cleaning lady likes the floor cleaner, but says the handle comes apart frequently while mopping?! the system does make the flooring lusterous :)"
4,"Works well, not sure it's worth the 30$","The mop is great and really easy to maneuver. The solution does not leave a residue on the floor, so that's great. The only con is that it is pricey."
5,Bona X Hardwood Floor Cleaner Kit,The Bona X Floor Cleaner Kit with cleaner pad does a wonderful job on our hardwood floors. We were introduced to this product by the girls who clean for us.
3,Cleans floors okay but does not make them shiny,I purchased the Bona Kemi thinking it would restore the high gloss to my hardwood floors and did not. I would recommend it to use as cleaning product it worked very well... I liked the cleaning pad I could remove it easily to rinse it off.
1,Poor Quality Mop,"The key to this product's effectiveness is the microfiber mop. Nearly any solution will produce similar results.The problem with this product is that the mop is shipped in sections that you have to put together, and in our case, within about 30 seconds of its first use, the sections split apart and the mop broke.I contacted the company who sells them on Amazon, and their response was -- to do nothing.So what I would do is to buy a microfiber mop that is one piece, and then buy just about any solution. Cheaper solutions can be found at Home depot etc, and Microfiber mops can be found at Wal Mart.This product works very well, but you can put together a much cheaper kit, and one that will last longer, on your own. To purchase from a company that doesn't stand behind their products is probably sending the wrong message. Maybe this one was defective and the others would have worked for a long time, but if you can't trust the company, it's probably not worth taking a chance."
3,"Terrific cleaner, awful mop!","So first, the good: I love the cleaner. I have an older house (1940) with original hardwoods. The hardwoods go through the entire house, and this cleaner was terrific. The wood looked conditioned, brighter, and clean. No film or streaky residue- I am very pleased with the cleaner. Five stars for that!Now the bad: the mop is AWFUL. Just terrible. It is, as other reviewers stated, flimsy. That wasn't my main gripe, though. The pole for the mop is ridiculously short. I am petite- just under 5'3"", and I had to hunch over to use it. My back burned by the time I was halfway through cleaning the floors. The pad that comes on the mop is good. I got a bit creative and used rubber bands to attach the Bona pad to a dry mop I already own. It's a bit of a pain, but it works. If the Bona people are reading this, this kit would be 5 stars if you could just improve that mop handle! The cleaner itself rocks."
4,Excellent read. A book to loose yourself in.,"This book is the first book I've read in a long time that has captured my imagination and made me feel like I know the characters personally. It gives the true atmosphere of Cornwall. I have lost myself for hours in this book. Can't wait to read the sequel, Pengarron's Pride."
4,very good filling soup,"I'm a huge fan of nearly all of the Amy's food line. This soup does not disappoint in terms of heartiness and its ability to serve as a meal. As a soup and salad girl, this soup has the ability to keep me full which is my number one priority when I don't know when I will be home to make a meal. As another poster noted, this would probably taste better if freshly made. I can't disagree. Anything tastes better if simmered in a pot for several hours. If you don't have the time, this is a good, vegetarian alternative that is sure to satisfy many. The flavor is rich but not spicy or too salty. This Amy's product does not disappoint."
4,Soup Cravings,"I purchased this item because Amy has another soup, the rustic vegetable one, that is so yummy. So, I was more open to tasting this one since I bought 12 of the other and now know how good it is. As compared to the other rustic vegetable one, for me, this one isn't as tasty, but still very good. I gave some to my friend, and she loved it immediately. It depends on your taste and perspectives. I trust Amy's products so anything you buy is good to great tasting and also healthy. So, overall good taste and well trusted brand, but I'd just prefer their other soup better. Get it if you are ok with the ingredients and are lazy to cook. great for feeling I'll and still following a healthy food plan."
1,What were the spices use?,"I am a big fan of the Amy's products and the soups that I have tried have been great. I wanted to try something new and I came across this one at the store several times before finally purchasing it. I liked the looks of the ingredients and it being a complete protien I was sure it would be a winner. YUCK!!! Not only was it gummy but the flavor was just terrible. I cant even put my finger on what it was but it was very unpleasant. So I actually found a soup that was terrible, so sorry Amy but you need to change this recipe or put 100 bucks in each can for me to buy it again.Great soups that I have tried by Amy'sLentilLenitl vegetableCurried LentilBlack beanSouthwestern vegetable"
4,tastes good and healthy for you,The first thing I noticed was that it had plenty of flavor and spices. It tasted really good. but I take one star away because I expected it to be thicker. I thought it would have more beans in it almost like a chili. But its more like a soup with not as many beans as I thought it would have. But than again i never looked up the word tuscan so that may just be my naivity when i bought it not knowing what it was. But it does taste good plus its organic with no negative additives.
4,A solid bit of historical fiction,"Jason Manning has written a series of novels about the Barlow family, starting with Lt. Timothy Barlow. This book is set during the War of 1812 and the Seminole War and features Barlow, young Ensign Sam Houston, General Andrew Jackson and a Creek warrior/family man named Rook. The book covers the Battle of Horseshoe Bend and some of Jackson's Seminole Campaign in some detail, while we get a history book type overview of the Battle of New Orleans.Manning's books are always well-researched and I am always a bit surprised that his stuff is always marketed with the pulp fiction westerns. Not that I dislike a good Western, mind you, but Manning's stuff is a cut above.The next book in the series isThe Fire-Eaters."
3,more solid afro-pop,"Typical Johnny Clegg sound and lyrics, but somehow this album just doesn't measure up to ""Third World Child"" and ""Cruel Crazy Beautiful World"". There are still 6 or so good tracks on here, so well worth a listen. Just don't make it the first Johnny Clegg album you buy."
3,Not a bit user friendly,"I bought this book because I want and need to know about this subject.I have come to really dislike this book and this author, becausealthough some of the information I want is here, it is presented so badly, it is very hard work to get it. It is mathematics authorship like this that gives math a bad name.This text was written in the '50's before the Deligne breakthroughs in this area and the later concentration on Calabi-Yau Algebraic varietiesin the area of mirror symmetry. He uses K for R ( real) and KP_nfor projective spaces, but mostly he is just sloppy about notation for sums and even vectors. His definitions always seem to leave me wondering what exactly he means. Mostly he leaves me wanting a book to explain his book. As a cheap starting place for Algebraic Geometry, you may want to pass this one up until you read something better?"
2,i can not wear it,"the earings are beautiful and attractive, but i can wear it because the posts are too thick. my ear got bleeding when try to put it in."
5,"works well,, last long, what's not to like?","We started with a pair for me...now our whole family has these and we will be loyal Teva water shoes users for many years to come. fit well, dry fast and last a LONG time. We have tried everything from bodyglove to nike and these are the longest lasting and best performing water shoes we have experienced to date. you wont be dissapointed."
3,Good projects - weak instruction,"The strength of this book is the 12 projects. They are imaginative and use many of the new features of Flash MX 2004. The projects have good graphics and text and video; and the screen shots are works of art. If what you want are ideas this is a perfect book. If you actually want to build these projects yourself, the authors have left a lot out. In particular, there is not a lot of rationale as to why you are doing certain things. That is, unless you know a lot of Flash, the instructions, while easy to follow if you just type the code, will seem bewildering. There needs to be more explanation, of what is behind the code constructs, not just the code itself.A number of the ""final"" versions of the project did not work well."
1,Shouldn't name this Flash MX 2004 Magic,"Shouldn't call this book a ""Flash MX 2004 Magic"" because the most of the code (I'd say 85%) in there are just AS1 (not mention that some of their codes are sloppy) They don't even deal with any special feature comes with MX 2004 at all, like create V2 component. I can say most of the project in there can be done with Flash MX (except the chapter about JSFL project, but for that, you can find a better tutorial online than reading that chapter)I did not read this book at all, bought it new, glanced thru it within an hour and never touch it again. If you are just a little more than a beginer then this book is right for you. If you are an AS coder, or been playing with Flash since version 5 or MX then forget about this one. If you live in Virginia, contact me, I let you borrow this book for a couple ...years."
1,Junk - Keep Away,"I have not even had the opportunity to shoot this gun. I purchased one and I took it out of the container, dry fired it twice. I loaded the magazine (very easy) and I tilted the gun down to insert the magazine and the barrel fell out. After that the top part of the gun in the front separated from the bottom part so it swiveled on the back half. Gamo Support made me PAY to ship the broken gun back to them and then told me it will take 4-6 weeks for either a repair or replacement. The repair department acknowledged that they received it 8 days after the tracking number showed it arrived. Their customer service was nice but could only tell me that it was in the process. Stay away from Gamo guns. I wish there was another review detailing the horror of working with and waiting on Gamo before I purchased this. They need to hire more employees if they can't get returns fixed or worked out any faster!"
1,Not like pictured,"The feeder I received didn't look like this one. It had holes too small to get seed from, and a piece was missing and all the seed leaked out of that hole. I trashed it."
4,Reaching New Millennium Heights,"I listened to the CD several times and found it to be very different. In the sense that it gave lyrics that had to be heard over and over again to be understood. The beats were funky and had me pattin my feet on every song. I felt like the artists really came together when they did Ugly Luv. A lot of the lyrics were hard-core, but not the type of stuff that would cause violence. They were the type that would keep your head bangin'. Throughout the CD the artists gave lyrics that helped you vision what they were expressing. Smuggaluzz was deep and helped the listener understand what Smuggaluzz's do and what it's all about. Mo Bout Me was good, but could have used stronger lyrics to make it even harder. Stalkin U and African Booti stole the show for the CD. The artists should be proud of this creation. I would be."
1,Dan Troxell's CD's,I am looking at Dan Troxell's CD's and none have the music titles listed. Other CD's have all the music listed so the customer will know what selections are on each CD.ThanksDucky
3,Some Good stuff here,May want to glean some of the best tracks which are the ones with Norton featured. Hey Grandpa is my favorite along with Big Jake.
4,"Great, but stays up for about a week.","I like this product alot; it is simple and gets the job done. Except for one thing. It falls off after being up for about a week. It doesn't seem to matter what the temperature, how clean the class is, etc. If you can deal with that, or only need to use your pass every now and then, you'll be happy with this product."
2,Does not work 60% of the time,I used this for about three weeks. I drive on NJ Tpk and GSP quite often. I also used it on a trip from NJ to DC. It does not work 60% of the time. I changed its location on the windshield a couple of times still it did not get better.
2,meltdown,mine melted off of the windshield (the black part that connected to the suction cups). i'm now in search of the original velcro style.
2,Falls Off,It does fall off. The best way to mount this is put it on the edge where the window and dashboard meet.
2,No good in summer,"Was happy initially - suction cups good, aesthetically pleasing, easy to move to another car.... was using it for my neighorhod transponder (gated community) My car is garaged and I always use a sun shade in parking lots. however, one summer day the black plastic melted and the holder fell from the suction cups (which remained on windshield). I almost crashed into the gates when they didnt open because the transponder was on my floor. Then I almost got rearended trying to back away from the gates and use the visitor entrance. disappointing."
1,Melts in the sun,"Bought this at Pep Boys and the thing melts in extreme summer heat. Also doesn't stick to well to window, even though I clean it."
1,They warp!,"With the intense summer heat experienced lately, this item warped and thankfully I didn't have my pass in it. That was my first and last experience with this cheap product."
5,Exactly as expected,"Simple to use product that does exactly what it is intended to do. holds my ez-pass well, and no problems."
1,Unsuitable plastic literally melts apart,"This is more substantial than other suction cup toll pass holders I've had, but the black version should be avoided because the material loses its shape in normal summertime temperatures even here in the mid-Atlantic. I installed two of these in different cars, and in both cases after several months of satisfactory operation they began to fall off their windshields, not because the suction cups had failed but because the tabs they're attached to had softened and distorted so they were no longer coplanar. In fact, the clear suction cups act like miniature lenses, focusing the sun onto the black plastic around them until it actually melts. One suction cup completely melted through its mount.Wrong type of plastic for this application, and it also would behoove the manufacturer to switch to opaque suction cups. I might try the white one - which should absorb less sunlight as heat - since I do like the design."
5,Strong Suction Cups,"Quality ez-pass holder. The suction cups are very strong and will not slide or ever fall off. Just be sure to wipe your windshield off and it will stick on and stay there. It's easy to remove the ez-pass, for whatever reason you need to, without having to pull the holder off your windshield."
1,Snausages....,"Bought this before summer to secure my EZpass. At first everything was gravy, the EZpass was secure and the suction cups worked. As the summer went on, the clip began to distort from the heat in the car (full black leather interior / black car / black clip). It was either that or aliens from space hit the clip with a laser beam. The EZpass fell out from time to time as the suction cups began to give up. I finally said F it and am currently looking for a replacement. I'll save you the trouble and give you mine for free."
4,Nice alternative to ezpass velcro,This holder is a nice alternative to the ezpass velcro. I use it for swapping between NH and MA ezpass transponders. The suction cups work. Only complaint is the transponder rattles a little bit. I fixed that by sliding some paper between the transponder and the window.
5,Everything was as expected!,I received the EZ Pass holder quickly and put it up in my car right away. It works great!
1,DOES NOT WORK DEFECTIVE PRODUCT,"This is a DEFECTIVE PRODUCT. This holder does not stay on the window. The one I received has a suction cup that is defective. When I rotated the suction cups, the spot with the defective suction cup did not hold and the 'holder' fell off. My hope was to use the holder whenever I am travelling where I need the EZPass. Instead, I am back to where I started, holding the EZPass up with my hand when I go through tolls. I recently ordered the velcro strips fro free from EZPass at the recommendation of a police officer working the tolls. When I receive these I will use them instead."
4,EZ pass holder,"I bought this product because I didn't want to put the velcro on my windshield. Plus we don't use the ez pass that often. It has been great so far. We are able to easily stick the ez pass on the windshield when we are going on a trip and easily able to remove it when we are done. The one downside came this summer in the extreme heat. We put the pass on the windshield to go to the beach and didn't take it off, as we would be driving to Boston soon after, and the extreme heat caused the plastic to warp and melt. I need to buy a new one as it is too warped to properly mount. I would highly recommend that you remove it from the car during extreme heat. Or at least remove it from the window. I still really like this product!"
3,Its ok,Its a three star just because one side of the suction wont stick on the glass. It still holds my ezpass thou becoz of the other 2 suction cups..so i didnt bother returning it.
4,Chilli Funky!!!,"Not giving it 5 stars, but it comes very close. If you like truly funky ""Deep House"" I higly reccomend this CD. Nice vocals and really funky basslines throughout the entire cd. Personal favorites are 'Believe' and 'Soul Music' but there are several other tracks that will have you movin and groovin. If you are a part time cd jock or just like collecting quality House Music this is a must have. 2 compilation cds and a bonus mixed cd come in the box set. If you listen to that techno garbage don't waste your money because this is real music."
2,Does Not Make Sense at All Except for a Poem,"What is good about a man wanting to keep memories about a woman who has erased all her memories of him? Nothing. The only thing I liked about the movie was the poem Kirsten Dunst's character recited, that's it. For this, I can add a star."
5,A must-have tool for colonial Bertie family research!,"First published in 1963, this book is a must-have item for the serious colonial North Carolina family history researcher. Many of the deeds recorded in Colonial Bertie were for second, third and fourth generation descendants of Southside Virginia immigrants. Compare the surnames with those found in Surry, Isle of Wight, James City, Southampton, Brunswick Cos., VA and you'll see the beginning of a westward trek in search of land and prosperity.This volume is a companion to the series of deed abstracts by Margaret H. Hoffman and can be used to compliment her various books."
4,"Ok, but nothing in depth for experienced CAD users","Pro-E has attempted to mask their never-ending menus with a pretty face lift this go 'round. This makes it hard for old users to adjust, but let's new users jump right in... at least at first. After awhile you'll realize how hard it is to memorize all of Pro-E's menu abbreviations! A textbook is a must, and this one does a decent job.This book leads you through both 3D part creation and machinist' drawings. It also teaches the user some of the in-depth features of Pro-E in regards to storing drawing configurations and etc. Book also covers motion/kinematic analysis.Book actually has a few errors on the spur & helical gear walk-thrus. If you look for them and think it through you can figure it out - or just ask your professor what the correct numbers are."
5,great shears,"These shears are really well designed and made. I use them every where particularly in the garden and on the boat. Because they come apart they are easy to keep clean. However, you have to be careful cleaning them because they are very sharp."
2,Don't get them wet !!!,These are suposed to be out door lights. I bought two because of the sale price. They worked great for the first day and then fizzled out about 2hrs later. I changed the solar batteries in one of them to see if it would make a difference. They finally worked...ok...for a couple of days. Then it rained. They both got wet on the inside and would not work correctly. I brought them in to dry and they appeared to be working again. Half A** that is. Then it rained again. So they are on my deck waiting for me to try and figure out if I should chunk them right into the trash. So disappointed....
5,Holocaust and Children,I have always taken an intrest in matters pertaining to WWII. Although I know no one who actually lived through the holocaust I have always taken an intrest in the event. If you have time to read only one book on the subject this should be it. It is easy to understand and get wrapped up in. Once you start you won't want to put this one down. It's full of fascinating facts.
4,Making sense of the second,"Down through the years I've heard many recordings and performances of Rachmaninov's second piano sonata; however, due to (I'm sure) something lacking within me, I've never been able to appreciate the work. This recording with Simon Trpceski ""turned the light on"" for me, and for once I actually liked the work and was emotionally moved by it. His technique is astounding and , to me for the first time, it did not sound as if the pianist was pounding the piano with his fists-the work's beautiful melodies were revealed to me for the first time.The shorter works on the recording are also played very well, but the second sonata, for me is the standout.The sound and musical programming are also outstanding!"
5,Great little tool.,It's a simple little device that helps you set your brake cables without knarling up the cable. It's quick and easy.
3,agree with others,"tool seems less sturdy than other Pedro's tools. that was disappointing....but, price was half the Park model. seems to work fine, but still a bit of disappointment given i like most of Pedro's stuff. oh well. i didn't want to spend 45$....got what i paid for. Niagra shipped fast, no prob there."
4,Review PEDRO'S BICYCLE CABLE PULLER,"This tool is great if you install/adjust bike cables. It holds the cable exactly where you want it (and you can release it freeing up your hand and it continues holding) before tightning the screw that secures the cable in place. Normally, you need two people to do this but the cable puller allows one person to do the job. I looked at the PARK tool that does the same thing but decided to buy PEDRO'S due to the price being about 6 dollars cheaper."
2,Not the best,This tool has a tendency to fray cable strands. I should have returned it. Its just as effective and more gentle on the cable using pliers.
3,Works as promised,Had for a while and used it a little. Initial use proves it does work and does not fray cables. Hold is good and you can really pull on it without fear of bending cable. Works fine.
1,Totally ripped off,"I really can't say if this product is good or no because, I was totally ripped off by CYBERHOUSE the people who sold me this. The turntable was missing a major part and did not even work. When I tried to return the item I was told because of a technicality they would not allow me to return the item. I am a US Airmen stationed over seas and during the holidays it takes long to get products sometimes. So to rip me off simply because I didnt get my package in time when it was missing parts is ridiculous. Never buy anything from CYBERHOUSE these people are unethical and criminal in my opinion."
4,Exellent Conternt in Search of an Editor,"Efforts to fix organitional, outlining, and other general editing problems from the previous edition, seem to have created greater problems rather than lessening them. That said, I still use it as my primaray text when I teach the subject to doctoral students because I can find nothing that does justice to the subject nearly as well.Dr. Richard E. Prince"
5,Glam Bam Thank You Ma'am,"Louis XIV is single-handedly going to bring back the pompous sexy glorious sounds of 70s glam rock. This EP is a shining star among the otherwise dull sky of modern rock. Complete with glitter eye makeup and lyrics that make a girl's (and possibly guy's) thighs tense, this dirty little album is the best thing since Ziggy Stardust. The track Illegal Tender is by far and away the best but that is a hard call to make. Front man Jason Hill has a speciality for cheeky yet sultry lyrics and a great mix of glam and almost AC/DC like riffs. This is an absolute must have!"
4,ECELLENT Production By PAJAM,"I normally don't listen to hip hop or Gospel Hip Hop, but I had to check out this CD, after hearing the song ""I'm Sorry"" which features J Moss. .There are actual songs on here for everybody, ""Power of Christ"" will be a favorable worship medley for the masses.Chozen with IRocc, is another favorite Jam...I to also luv the classic more ""soulful"" Redition of Again I Say Rejoice...Watch out Gospel Music fans, 21:03 is sure to take the Music Industry by storm"
3,same song wuz up j moss u can't write another song,3rd storee has the same song on their cdth song/ i'm sorry check it out. i think a few of the members are the one's in 21:03
1,I'm shocked that so many people like this..,"Like many others, I heard the song ""I'm Sorry"" and got excited about the idea of a soulful, young, male gospel group. I was even more interested when I found out J Moss was involved with them since I loved his first album. However, I was heartbroken when I finally got the whole album and discovered that ""I'm Sorry"" was one of only 3 really great songs on this album. The others are ""Sweet Spirit"" and ""Don't Say No."" I'm really into well written, rhythmic, and significant songs, especially when it comes to gospel, but most of the songs on this album have mediocre lyrical content and the words don't flow. Some songs like ""See Me"" and ""Power of Christ"" seem like wonderful lyrics wasted on terrible beats and production while ""Spiritual Bizness"" and ""Chozen"" are hot beats with little to no significant message.I certainly was not inspired or moved by this album but I will look for them to do better next go around. It seems like they can sing."
2,Not So Hot,"I bought this CD because the samples of the music that I heard sounded pretty good. After listening to it a few times, however, I find the selections to be repetitive and unremarkable. Most likely, I will listen to it once or twice more, but I'll probably end up donating this CD to a charity thrift store."
4,Just like a Turkey Sandwich,"This literature was very enriching, but a little dry. Overall, the reading experience was rewarding, and quite informative.4 Stars."
5,Good design,"The recumbent style is more comfortable than the traditional bicycle style. I used some wooden shims under the seat to make it more quiet while I watch TV, so that now it is very quiet. This is a good machine."
5,Quality and value,I've had the Schwinn 230 for 6 months and it has been great. I have a bad back and arthritic knees and this machine has really helped me. It's a great bike for the price. I did not have any shipping problems and assembly was fairly easy. This was a great purchase!
4,Great gift to manage health,"My husband bought a Schwinn Recumbent Exercise Bike as part of a New Year's resolution in order to increase our exercise and ability to lose weight. I thought it would be an eyesore in the dining room and something we would never use. Well, I'm glad that I was wrong. The bike turned out to be a blessing. I've lost quite a bit of weight since last year through dieting and recumbent bike exercise. It is easy to use. I love knowing my heart rate and the distance I've biked. The bike gives you a lot of choices. For example, you can go for a ""ride in the park"" or manually set your parameters in terms of time and levels of achievement. It's comfortable and even has a book holder if you like reading while you exercise. As a result of the bike, I have been taking much better care of myself."
4,Great Bike for the price,"Bought this bike based on some mixed reviews. I will say it is easy to put together. And when it is together it is easy to use. The bike is really quiet, the only thing you can hear is my shoelaces ticking away. I am very glad I bought it."
1,Never Get Anything Bigger Than A Book from Amazon,"I cannot believe how difficult it has been to get this stupid bike delivered! Seriously, it has been sitting more than a week in the UPS office. This is the second terrible experience I have had with getting something delivered that was bigger than a book. Save yourself some time and aggravation, I could have gotten this with no tax, no shipping and less hassle from another online dealer! I will NEVER use Amazon again for something like this."
1,still can't use bike,"We haven't been able to use our new bike because it doesn't work. After putting the bike together the resistance did not work. I called Nautilus, who said they would send a replacement part and set up a repair call. I received the part in 2 days, however no repair call was made. After a week I called Nautilus, who said the repair order was not set up, another week, a repair guy came and said the wrong part was sent! After having our bike 1 month, we still can't use it!A warning - be very careful when you install the cable to the console, it goes into a very tight spot and can be easily damaged. Hopefully we will be riding in another week..."
1,More Shipping problems,"Seems like the shipping on this item is just problematic. I ordered it on my Prime account. Apparently it doesn't qualify for two day delivery, rather it gets shipped UPS ground. UPS ground services don't include a preferred delivery time range. Unlike anything else I order from Amazon, it also requires a signature on delivery(everything else can be left on my covered porch) I would've had to take a day off work to be home and able to sign for it. I had to let it be returned to sender. It was a mess and I didn't get to actually receive the product."
5,Brilliant,"Bought this one after having done a lot of competitive shopping. The only negative so far is that you better have a trigger finger to record your exercise data after wards, as it disappears within 2 minutes and is lost forever.. But overall, great machine, energy efficient, smartly engineered for comfort and results. An expensive seat that takes abuse and doesn't wear, the machine is built from higher quality metals and plastics than usual, trust the name, trust the construction and trust the results you will get, the best exercise bike I have ever been on. Great programs that constantly challenge you."
4,Schwinn Recumbant,"Overall this is a great bike. It is smooth, comfortable, and has many different degrees of difficulty which match differences between my wife and I. Also, the programs that come with the bike are varied and fun to use. The pulse moniter works great and is easy, just hang onto the grip. My only complaints are minor. One, it takes well over an hour to assemble. Two the screen is mounted high which makes it difficult to watch TV while riding. I have to look to one side to view the TV aroung the monitor."
5,Great Bike,"I purchase this bike because I needed an acitivity to pump up my heart rate, Its sturdy, and easily put together, has different programs, and I also received it early( which was fine with me)and received a phone call also before it was delivered. The cost was good and this bike was worth it. I would refer this to all my friends and family."
4,good purchase,Read quite a few reviews before purchase and it stands up to them all. This model was no longer carried in the store and was the one that was rated well by Consumer Reports. Box arrived slightly crunched but parts all intact. Very easy to put together even though i would agree to put together the display part first and feed the wires down the tube and attach vs. the directions saying the opposite.Is a pretty quiet ride and the only downside my husband finds but i'm fine with it is he has trouble reading the display. Good bike for the money
4,Satisfied customer,"The Schwinn 230 Recumbent bike has been an excellent purchase. It is a solid, easy to use and realitively inexpensive excercise bike that my wife and I use regularly. Set up of the bike was not bad, but I did have a problem connecting the electrical wires. As a result, I did not have any power to the console. My call to support was handled pleasantly, and with their help I was able to get the connection working. I haven't had a problem since."
1,Recumbent Bike - Schwinn 230,"I do not recommend this bike from Amazon. We received it and the motor is broken. We now have a bike that we are paying for on our credit card and have to wait for 1 month to have the new part installed after 2 hours of putting it together. It will be impossible to get it back into the box. I have written to Amazon requesting suspension of the charge on my credit card, but they missed the point and replied that they cannot get us the part sooner. They totally missed the point. I am very disappointed. Schwinn however has been very responsive and nice. Amazon has been frustrating to talk to and to write an email to. Do not buy through Amazon. A charge on credit card, but no use of bike."
1,nightmarish experience with Schwinn bike,"I placed an order for the bike in November 07. Bike arrives 2 wks later. Box was in bad shape but intact. When I opened it, paddles, computer, both hand grips, totalling 4 were missing and side plastic covers were broken. After contacting them, parts come in 2 wks. Then the part for the computer was WRONG model #. Then the right part arrives in 1 wk. Then I get the empty promise and a run around about a technician visiting me to fix things. That HAS NOT HAPPENED yet.After 3 months , bike has many problems that who knows when will be fixed. If you want to buy expensive problems with a low quality Chinese made machine, pay like $500.00"
4,Schwinn 230,"Nice bike for the money! Two things keep this from being a 5 star bike in my book. The first thing is the power supply, I mean are you serious? I have a more robust power supply for my electric razor. I know it will be just a matter of time until I trip over it or whatever. The power supply should be built in with a heavy duty power cord. The second item is the computer. It simply can't be read unless there is a good light shining directly on it. I know this does not sound to important, but it is!I hope this helps somebody. This is my first recumbent bike and I really do like it alot save for those 2 items."
5,Worth the price,"I was apprehensive about the shipping after reading other reviews. However, the shipment arrived in perfect condition. It was quite simple to set up, my husband and I set it up in almost 2 hours.This bike is quiet, smooth and sturdy-definitely much more sturdier than cheaper models I had evaluated. Worth the price."
4,Schwinn 230 recumbent bike,"Item arrived with slight cosmetic damage to the plastic housing. I decided the damage was not worth returning the bike. We use the bike often. It is very comfortable, easy to set up and durable. We are pleased with our purchase."
5,Worth It!,"Took two hours to put together. Very well built. Excellent opportunity to exercise at home. If you are on the fence, go ahead and buy.2 years later, December 2009, still a great bike."
3,Love at first sight..then things changed,"I brought this bike for its looks and the fact that it was much quieter then my last bike..I have had it since Dec. 2007...with no problems until now..almost to the exact day of purchase 4 years later the computer LCD Monitor has stopped working...It just went dead. checked all connections they were fine..I called for a new monitor and it was $136 without shipping costs..The bike had for 10years never had any mechanical problems...I do not recommend this product...Update brought the bike on Dec. 2007...The computer hasn't worked since Winter 2011..I called the company, they wanted over $100 for a new computer....Now I bike with out...and it isn't as quiet as it once was.."
5,Great sturdy exercise bike at a good price.,"Bought this bike not quite a year ago. I did not experience any issues with shipping and everything arrived in good shape. Instructions for assembly were very clear and it couldn't have taken me longer than 2 hours to assemble. One thing that really amazed me was just how quiet the bike was. It is very sturdy and doesn't shake when peddling at high intensity. The way the bike is constructed, it doesn't seem like there is a risk of mechanical wear over time and it has held up to daily use in the year I have owned it well. It has all of the program options and workout stats that you would expect on an exercise bike at your local gym. I have used many different high-end bikes in gyms and this one isn't much different in quality or function other than the flashiness of the display screen. I can't think of any major complaints. For the price, it is money well spent."
4,Good Machine,Easy to assemble and is holding up very well. We ride it for 1/2 hr intervals at least 5 hrs per week and have had no problems. A few more programed courses would be the only change I would recommend.
4,Schwinn,"Nice bike, very easy to put together and good exercise. The LCD monitor could be upgraded to a brighter and nicer looking one."
3,Schwinn 230 ecumbent exercise bike,"A few months ago, we purchased the Schwinn 230 recumbent exercise bike. It took us 4 1/2 hours to assemble it, which I expected. If you pay close attention to the instructions, assembly is satisfactory. But, the heart monitor has never worked -- therein lies the dissatisfaction. After having written Schwinn three times and sending two emails regarding this problem, there has been no response whatsoever. So, if you purchase the bike, hope it comes in complete working order, because the company will offer no assistance or resolution."
2,deffective,"The control console would not work. The tension and all programs are controlled thru the console.I received another console from Schwinn and it still wouldn't operate. I finally returned the whole thing. What a pain, and a lot of work. Putting it together,trouble shooting the problem,waiting on parts,disassembling, repacking and hauling it up to the UPS store for shipment back. What a workout!!"
4,"Well constructed, attractive","I bought this bike based on the great value for the money and the great reviews. Most of the bad reviews were based on shipping problems. I decided to buy it locally at w-mart to avoid any shipping damage. Yes, i had to pay tax. Today the price at Amazon is 435. It was listed at the local store shelf tag (and online) as 377, but it rung up at the register as 299 (secret sale?). I put it together; yes there were quite a few parts, but it was well designed and they supplied all necessary tools. Even the packaging made sense. It is attractive, and it is very solidly made. I gave it 4 stars because the pulse rate monitor is not working, but it may be a loose connection, or I may have to call Schwinn. It is not crucial to us anyway. For the price, I am already satisfied."
4,Great bike,I've been using this bike for the last month and I can say that it was well worth the price. I would have spent more on a gym membership and been there a fraction of the times that I have already used this. One downside: it does take up some considerable room so make sure you have a good place to put it. It's not flashly but it works and I find that it runs smooth and quietly.
1,"Bad Bike, Bad Company","This bike crapped out on my stroke patient father after 95 days. They gave me this nonsense that it was passed the 90 days and I would have to pay for service to get it fixed. They should have just honored it. Seriously, if you can't make a product that lasts more than 90+ days, you shouldn't be in business. I'll never buy Schwinn again."
3,a bit disappointing,"Good thing : Bike is very nice, robust, VERY SILENT!!!2 BAD THINGS : No place to put your Ipod - I can not believe it + Seat is totally uncomfortableI cannot find a comfortable position to ride, and neither did my wife. the seat is to be too reclined, making it hard for the bottom of your back after biking for 1/2 hour.. on top of that, the electronic system is more gadget-like than what one would expect from Schwinn...WANT AN ADVICE - GO TO DICKSPORTINGGOODS, TEST IT, AND BUY IT THERE, IT IS THE SAME PRICE MOST OF THE TIME."
5,Ceiling fan,"This fan is great, was easy to install and very quiet. Would definitely recommend this fan. The only down fall is it doesn't have a remote but really not necessary where we installed it."
5,"Classy fan, right price","After doing some research for a ceiling fan for out newly remodeled home, I came across this model. For the price, you can't beat the quality. It is super quiet, moves alot of air and looks great. The paddles are reversible to match your liking. I suggest using energy efficient (CFL) candelabra base bulbs instead of the regular bulbs it calls for, makes it look intresting plus saves on the $$ in the long run."
2,"""Uses 3 60-watt bulbs"" SURPRISE SURPRISE","The fan itself is fine, but the BULB SOCKETS ARE TINY. I was all set to put in my energy-saver compact fluorescent bulbs when I discovered they wouldn't fit, nor will normal bulbs. The fan comes with 3 flame-shaped bulbs fitted to tiny sockets. Did I miss this info here? It's also not on Hunter's own page and PDFs for this model."
3,"very nice fan, but the product description could be improved","I would appreciate it if Amazon and the manufacturer would make it absolutely clear when the product, in this case the Hunter 20430, takes candelabra-sized bulbs only. Instead, the product description evasively (artfully?) failed to provide that information. Otherwise, the fan is very nice and certainly attractively priced."
4,Performs as expected,"The (2)fans arrived as expected and were not unusually difficult to install. Appearnabce is good and operation has been as expected. These fans have a bit of wobble out of the box. I would rather not have to balance them but it may be necessary to do so. We had multiple light bulbs fail within two weeks of installation, so I think it is safe to say they are substandard. Overall, these are good, not great, fans. Keep in mind that if you use the Hunter remote control, each fan must be set to a different operating frequency to be controlled independently. If not, one remote will control multiple fans."
4,Wonderful Ceiling Fan,"This fan is just as expected. It took a few hours to put together and install. I appreciate the speeds. The fan is very quiet. The lights blew out, but that was a problem with the bulbs (a bad batch from Phillips); Sylvania bulbs are working. I got a couple of light pulls to extend the chains."
1,Poor Design,"Very poor design! The canopy will not sit flush against the ceiling. There's a ~ inch gap between the ceiling and the top of the canopy! This looks terrible. Further, was unable to reach technical support! The contractors took fans down several times to try to correct this gap.Hunter you need to fix this problem and address it in your description and instructions! So don't take a lot of time when installing to figure out why there a gap between ceiling and and fan canopy. You may not mind this gap but I think it's really terrible! A very very poor design. Do NOT recommend!"
1,gotcha,"I went back to review my purchase of a Hunter Fan because it is malfunctioning. This fan is not even close to what I ordered but yet it appears on my history. Thanks again, Amazon.com"
2,Not so frightful October,"Perhaps the very young will find the stories in this book frightening, but frankly I'd feel quite safe reading it to 6 year olds. Not sure it would long entertain even the very young. The stories are very predictable. They lack atmosphere as well."
2,Not what I thought,"Bit disapointed,expected him to be singing complete songs, instead its a documentary and poorly done at that. like his singing and if thats what you want, dont bother with this one. Cheers."
2,IT's FRENCH,"Not what I thought it would be. Not traditional middle eastern Arabic. It's moroccan which is predominantly french/arabic. If you're looking for ARABIC music, this isnt it."
4,The most beautiful women ever to appear in a single film,"If you speak French or can put up with sub-titles, you will really enjoy this movie. If on the other hand you just want to see God's most beautiful creatures, this is a must see. Not an ounce of silicon in sight. Zalman King eat your heart out. Sophie Marceau's body is the epitome of perfection and everything I had ever fantasized about. Her part is even in English. Even the fact that she was nude with John Malkovich did not detract for her beauty. Sophie is a ten if ever there was one. Chiara Caselli and Inés Sastre are 9.5s. Oh yeah, it is a pretty good story. Several little vignettes are woven together in a sort of Six Degrees of Separation style."
3,Average Antonioni...,"This film was Antonioni's first after a long hiatus from filmmaking. There are interlinking segments with John Malkovich as a film director that were directed by Wim Wenders, but overall, it's an Antonioni film. While there are some great shots and camerawork, it just felt empty. It's like one reviewer said: it was ""Antonioni doing Antonioni"". I kept looking for something profound and worthwhile, like in Michelangelo's masterpieces from L'avventura to Blow-Up (and The Passenger), but usually came away empty. Aside from one story with a woman who reveals to her lover that she's about to become a nun, none of the stories generate much interest, and Wenders's segments are incredibly pretentious, with ponderous, condescending narration. The film is worth checking out if you dig Antonioni (Marcello Mastrioanni's segment is quite good), but overall, it's a rather staid exercise with some thoughtful, Antonioniesque moments."
2,Cafe Emanuelle,"This movie is about various beautiful young European women who glimpse various balding, middle-aged American men and fall madly in lust with them, pursuing them across rain-swept fishing villages and quaint cafes until the men finally give in and take them home. This would have been a good formula if the film had been directed by Ron Jeremy, but as it is it's a humiliation. However, it could be edited down to eight minutes of high-grade nudity."
1,Sorry,"I wanted to like Hitachi because of the price & the looks, but the motor fried the 2nd time I used it. I own a small cabinet shop in PA."
3,"Alright Mix, but there's better out there.","If you're new to Leo, and you watched these three movies, you'd most likely be unimpressed. Man in the Iron Mask is actually a pretty good movie. Romeo+Juliet I find good, but it's one of those movies that you either love or hate. The Beach is alright as well, but not the best.If you want some of Leo's better work, check out:Titanic, The Aviator, Blood Diamond, Revolutionary Road and The Departed."
5,good mix,All three films are excellent; DiCaprio delivers every time. Watch Romeo and Juliet more than once to fully appreciate the film.
2,Not a great collection,I got this for The Man In The Iron Mask. I figured I would give The Beach a try. I never did like Romeo and Juliet when it came out. I was actually hoping that my opinion would change. I still HATE Romeo and Juliet. This is a strange movie. I do like Paul Rudd though. The Beach was just boring and really didn't go anywhere. I should have just gotten Man In the Iron Mask by itself. I ended up giving this set to a friend and buying the other movie on Amazon.
1,Leonardo has done better,"If is were your first introduction to Leonardo's work, I think you'd be disappointed. By all means get The Man in the Iron Mask - he's great. The other 2 movies are a sad disappointment - much to do with the movies in general but definitely not his best work.The Man in the Iron Mask"
5,Original and Sensitive Interpretation of Scarlatti Sonatas,"With her 17 Scarlatti sonatas, Ms. Zhu Xiao-Mei attains that rare combination of virtuoso playing and poetic, sensitive interpretation that makes Scarlatti music unforgettable and always new. Only Andras Schiff and Ivo Pogorelich play this music with similar delicacy of touch, pianistic ease, and attention to little nuances of sound. Ms. Zhu's playing of such well known pieces as K27 and K32 is new and original, in fact her K32 is simply breathtaking. Among less known sonatas that she has chosen, K141 and K142, two contrasting pieces, are exceptionally beatiful. This is a great recording, highly recommended to those who love Scarlatti. The sound quality is also excellent, even though this is a live performance (which makes it even more astonishing). I hope Ms. Zhu will record more, she surely deserves to be better recognized."
4,"Lots of Fun, not really a workout","I was very excited to get this DVD in the mail. When it arrived (in a timely fashion) I quickly tried it out. I really had a lot of fun doing all of the moves and it was very easy to pick up the steps. I wouldn't quite call it a workout though. It was more relaxing than anything else. I didnt walk away out of breath or tired, and I'm not sure if it has actually toned anything, but it has kept me active after sitting at work all day.I joke with my family and friends and tell them I am going to belly dance my way through labor, but I do plan to use some of these moves during labor as I am planning a natural delivery. I will let you know how that goes in a few months."
3,Average for DJ Escape,"I am a huge DJ Escape fan, and I have enjoyed all of his previous releases because they are very true to his DJ form. ""Bangin 3"" was somewhat disappointing because it sounded identical to all the other circuit dance CD's that flood the market. Escape's style has always been a little darker, harder, & edgier - for those of us who don't appreciate the fluff, Escape is a gift to the gay dance scene. This new CD has its moments, but I feel Escape somewhat sold out a little with this one. I recommend the CD because there are some bland club songs that Escape spices up; it's always fun to see what Escape will do with a song. Altogether this is a ""safe"" CD for Escape that will sell to a wide variety of Club goers. For those of us who have followed Escape throughout his career, the CD plays on the surface and never really goes into Escape's true deep form."
4,thankfully someone happened to shelve this w/ st. germain,"I bought this from a local cd store that very curiously (if not ignorantly) placed this cd next to St.Germain (Boulevard, Tourist) but so happened I thought I'd give it a try...and I was pleasantly surpised! Some extremely good electro-jazz beats, unfortunately not consistent throught out every track but very chilled throughout. Cusiously I think the amazon track list is different but regardless this is a good cd to get for devoted fans of St.Germain, Kruder & Dorfmeister, and Thievery Corporation."
3,Un fim trop oublié,"J'ai longtemps recherché un exemplaire de ce film rare, qui mériterait largement une réédition DVD (de préférence multilingue)."
4,Not a lot of grit,Not a lot of grit in this movie that probably appeals most to women. I can`t understand why they chose this title which has very little to do with the story.
2,Very poor quality of VHS,"I enjoyed the story but parts of this VHS were so dark you couldn't see the actors, only hear them. If I'd known the image would be so poor, I don't think I would have bought it. I'm trying to find the more recent Fanny by Gaslight version now, the one done by the BBC."
4,Play The Game,"They are finally starting to get HHH closer to his actual likeness. Head scan is brilliant, with the little snarl on frown on his face. Has the goatee and trimmed beard look. And the body shape is the best I have seen, is larger, muscular body which is not quite so cut on the definition. Only missing a little tape on the fingers and the HHH logo on boots. I give it a 8.5/10, Buy it."
5,How?,"Finally! After so many months, Dad knows! But Mom...Visser One's host has gotta be freed. Pronto. It doesn't like Tobias's crispy talons, so I'm gonna do it. Period. But how? If I want my mother back, how will I free her?..."
3,Animorphs-Revelation By: K.a. AppleGate,There are fighting Aliens trying to save earth. There is a boy named Marco and Animorphs who want to try to save earth.Marco's father is talking about his secret top project. Marco thinks its about Zero space. Yeerks are trying to attack earth but Marco is not going to surrender to the Yeerks. He will do his best to save earth. What I like about this book is it has alot of dialogue.I recommend this book to young children.
1,Horrible Blues Album,"Firstly, I'm a huge fan of Eddie Taylor. I love his work with Jimmy Reed and I have his ""I Feel So Bad"" album. The problem with this disc is not the guitar work, but the lazy vocals, and absence of lyrics. Throughout the entire album, Taylor unsuccessfully improvises lyrics that do not rhyme. Sometimes, when the response (as in the Call & Response lyrical format of the Blues) is supposed to be given, Taylor just mumbles something incoherently. Did he regularly perform like this in a live setting? The ""I Feel So Bad"" album has some great lyrics, so I'm a bit confused by this release. Though I disagree completely with the other reviewer, I'd like if it he/she could address my questions about the terrible lack of lyrical originality on this album."
5,Most moving and useful book I've read other than the Bible.,"I cannot say enough about Raising a Modern-Day Knight. I have already started utilizing the concepts and ideas provided. The impact has been tremendous! I will be leading a Sunday School class on this book starting in May. All I can say is, ""Read it!"""
4,Great Advice for Fathers,This book sheds great light on the importance of being intentional with your teachings of manhood to your sons. Lewis provides great illustrations of how it worked for his circle of friends.
5,wow,This book gives youy great general and specific guidlines for raising a son with not just character and honesty but also a good spiritual balance.
4,Informative offered new approaches to dealing with raising son's to manhood.,The book gave good insights into opportunities along the life of a son for a father to impart biblical sound advice and encouragement.
5,Great book for any guy (not just Dads),"This book is a must read for Dads and helpful for any guy in this day and age.I have been buying this book for many of my friends, my brother and brothers-in-law, all of whom have got kids to raise in our modern society. I strongly recommend it !"
5,A must have for every father of boys!,"This book shows you how to guide your son into authenic, biblical manhood. With all the mixed messages being thrown at our boys these days, this book will really help you nail down a well thought approach to properly transitioning your boy into manhood with a real sense of what a Godly man is supposed to be."
5,Excellent source for successful fatherhood,"This book clearly outlines the risks of absentee fathers. It outlines concrete steps to intructing young men how to act as biblical men and fathers. While instruction is no guarantee of success, it is better to have a roadmap or plan than none at all. Each chapter is thoughtful, and constantly references scripture as it's authority."
5,Modern Day KNight,a must read for dads who want to raise their young men to be righteous and to fulfill God's plan in their lives.
3,"Great Concept of Milestones, but Very Little Focus on the Everyday Mechanics of Raising a Modern ""Knight""","This book, and the similar title How to Raise a Modern Day Princess, focus on the use of milestones to help children move from childhood successfully into a godly and respectable adulthood, growing as people and stepping up into being the person God called them to be. I think this is a really good idea, and as such the books definitely say something worth hearing. However, the book does not go into any specific strategies or methods for child-training in everyday, day-to-day life, and therefore seems, to me, rather incomplete. Based on the title, I would have expected this book to have more advice for practical, everyday, general child-raising, eg, how to train a child in knighthood in the common day, through everyday experience."
5,"Giant Steps: Gonzalo Rubalcaba, Live at Mt Fuji",OUTSTANDING!! I have never heard a better version of Giant Steps. This is bop at it's best.
2,I was expecting more.,This item came in a timely fashion but was not what I was expecting. It was on the cheap side. A very hard leather instead of a nice soft leather. I would have sent it back if it wasn't such a hassle. Would not buy anything like this again from a third party.
2,not what i expected!!!,"The product arrived on time, but when i open it the leather was all stain and had cracks.... as i said, it's not what i expected..."
1,You get what you pay for,"This is an inexpensive wallet that looks like an inexpensive wallet. The quality of the leather is bad, but the price is also low, so in essence, you get what you pay for."
1,Pure junk,"These blades will not cut. They burn wood when in the cut. The problem is that there is no hook ground into the face of the teeth (poor design or manufacturing-made in China). They ""cut"" like a dull blade that has cut thru large nails. I've used table saw blades including hollow ground for over 50 years and these are just junk. I ordered some in December and returned them. I reordered some in March thinking the first ones were just from a bad batch but the second order was just as bad. The only positive note here is Amazon is OUTSTANDING in customer service including accepting returned items that are not satisfactory."
3,Nice but not what I expected,"Don't get me wrong, this is a very nice well made basting spoon. However there were 2 things that bothered me. 1 - the spoon itself was too thick, and 2 - the silicone made the spoon really flexible. Its probably ideal for replacing a ladle for soups and sauces but not for basting roasts (the thickness and flexibility prevents a good amount of gravy from getting scooped up)."
2,not as handy as I hoped,I have to admit that this is not as handy as I hoped. It is big and clumsy and it's a little too flexable.
5,"Alternate title is ""Swan Song""","Fourth in a series of mystery novels featuring Gervase Fen, the Oxford Don. ""Dead and Dumb"" which was published in 1947, embroils Fen in a murder epidemic among the members of a Wagnerian opera company.NOTE: the alternate title (as published in the United States) is ""Swan Song."""
4,Tiger Flashlight,"My order arrived promptly but there was a chip in the flashlight so I only give it 4 out of 5 stars...Since this was a present for my five year old grandson, and being a ruffie, I decided it wasn't worth sending it back to get a new one because I figured it would end up with a lot more chips in the end anyway..but the product was great for the money...worked great and made a growl sound...he loves it and thats all that matters...CJ StJohn...Putnam, CT"
2,Roland ME-70 DVD Video Tutorial,"I was very disappointed with this ""tutorial"". I bought it because I was hoping to learn the ""secret"" to getting the amp models to sound good through my various amps, and I was expecting him to go into more detail as to how to get specific sounds from the ME-70.Actually he just reviews the functions of the various controls, and some of these he kind of skips right over. I learned nothing that I didn't already know from reading the manual. At one point he said to avoid using the amp models if plugging into the front of your guitar amp, which contradicts the information given on the Roland/Boss website. The website says the ME-70 was DESIGNED to plug into the front of an amp......"
5,Christmas Gifts,Nice shirt that arrived quickly and I would not hesitate to do business with this company again.
1,Save your money,This is not the old classic Avery stuff...this is some newer done crappy produced garbage..Save your cash..pass on this one..
1,Definitely NOT Tex Avery,"This deceptively pitches itself as the work of Tex Avery. However it is a sub-par cowboy cartoon series where the main character is named Tex Avery. It claims to be inspired byTex Avery's animation style (bitch, please!) but is not amusing, entertaining or otherwise worthwhile in any way. False advertising to be sure. Avoid like herpes!"
1,Not Tex Avery,"Be warned that this DVD does not contain any work by the animator, Tex Avery. The comments and packaging should be clearly explored before purchasing this product if you're expecting to expand your Tex Avery library."
2,Broke after a year,"Mine broke after a year of light to medium use. I didn't put excessive strain on it. The break occurred on the handle where the plastic grip meets the silicone-covered part. Beneath the silicone is a plastic core that snapped. Otherwise, the turner worked well and did not scratch on teflon."
5,Excellent product..,"Can't say enough good things about this cold pack. I LOVE IT and use it often. Keep it in the freezer and it's ready when I need it. No more bags of frozen vegetables to sooth any aches/pains/sprains, no gel packs that freeze hard as a rock. The cold pack gel stays just as soft after it's been in the freezer as before and molds directly to wherever you need it (head, neck, ankle, back, etc.) Comes in a variety of sizes and the price is perfect. Got my original from the chiropractor (pricey) and have had it for 3 yrs. Has stayed just like new. Glad Amazon sells it and has the best buy for this product."
3,smells,It is not the size I was thinking it would be. It's small and warms up after less time than previous packs I have bought. I also think it gets a weird smell to it.
4,works great,I only used it once but it did what it was suppose to do Keep cold I would recommend this product
3,Inspiration from a respected leader,"The Spyglass is not just for grades K-5. Our Chief Technology Officer read this story to us during our last meeting, and most of us have graduated from grade 12. He is the wise king who peers through the wrong end of the spyglass and goes forth to tell all about his great visions and we are the poor peasants who will carry out his wishes."
5,A great reference for haiku,The Haiku anthology was a great read. The poems are organized in sets by author for easy reference and represent some of the best english language haiku that I have read. I would recommend this anthology to everyone who loves haiku as a must for their library.
5,Haiku book,Books were in excellent condition even though they were classified used. Arrived in very good time. Thank you.
2,I was disappointed,"I love haiku. Well-written haiku, however. Many of the haiku in this book seem to be sentences divided into three lines. That isn't haiku. If one observes the 5-7-5 or a total of 17 syllables, many haiku in this book fall short. In some instances, the last line (supposed to be 5 syllables) was 10 syllables! There were some nuggets here and there but, all in all, I was disappointed in this book."
1,English language haiku not-so-hot,"When I ordered this book I wasn't aware that it was a collection of haiku written by English-speaking folk. And the results are not good, I'm afraid. All great haiku show a deep connection to a Zen mind. Without it, the results are often quite shallow for the genre. Haiku is the ultimate compression of meaning; these did very little for me. I'm returning the book pronto!"
1,A very one sided view of the work/child dillema,"Nina Barrett seems to be the type of woman who love to have a problem. Her basic premise is that any ""good"" mother would want to stay home with her child, but that doing so is horribly boring and depressing. She fails to recognize the all or nothing approach both she and the other mothers take in this book. She also fails to recognize the problem parenting that seems to permeate all those in her playgroup. (These are people who really believe that you should reason with a two year old and who are frustrated when this approach does not work.)"
4,""" the best racing game i've ever purchased; hours of fun""","if you're a huge sprint car fan like i am, than this game is a must have. i have the PC version and this game for PS2 is much more realistic. the realism is fantastic also. my only complaint is the when racing in career mode, the game freezes up after a few races. the arcade mode is really fun as you race for points through out a complete series. if you think the many NASCAR games are to slow and boring like i do than give this game a try. there is so much action, you won't have time to blink an eye or you pay the price. i've been looking for a game like this."
4,this game is tuff,im not a big sprint car person and i didnt know jack about how to set it up to race with a wheel its difficult not to spin out but it is fun
5,Career mode,Something is wrong with the career mode. This product was made in mass production and it freezes up often and is very difficult to deal with. The game is fun and very real.
3,NO LOCK!!,"It is a wonderful product, but beware, it does NOT have a lock for easy nursing. If you want one with a lock, you must special order it and it will take about a month."
3,from the picture it looks like the item is for the hanging file. there is no picture of a lable,there is no picture of the lable that is for sale. It looks like the item is for the hanging. I know it saids that it is for the lable but the pitcure is very misleading.
5,Better than the first!,"This game is so fun! You get to play lots of characters. It is pretty fun. Only that I haven't gone so far. Free play is not available. But overall, it's fun. I like this game! Come and check it out!"
4,Pretty good,"This game is really fun!These are the only bad things:*Once you beat story mode and unlock all the characters,(it isn't easy), it gets sort of boring.*You can't die. every time your hearts go to 0, you fall apart and lose some studs, (the currency), they just go out and you can get them again.*once you unlock use old save (where you can load characters from the first game,but you have to have memory data), you can't be them in the cantina.(the place where you start out.)"
5,Great Game,This is a great game. It can be challenging enough to keep things exciting over and over.
5,A great game!,"I bought LSW:II because I really enjoyed the first installment, and the new features definitely made it even better than the first! It'll have you coming back again and again, exploring the intricacies of each level to find all of the hidden secrets.If you're looking for Lego Star Wars, I recommend you wait for Lego Star Wars: The Complete Saga, which according to LucasArts is coming in the fall of 2007 (so pretty soon now). It won't be released on the GameCube, though, so if you're looking for a great GameCube game, this is the one you want!"
2,Lego Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy (GameCube),My son loves this game. I bought it for his birthday. Up until then he was borrowing his best friends copy of the game. It has brought him hours of endless joy.
1,omg!,"this game is the same with the first!!!!!!!! except u get episodes 4-6. wow. big deal. want a good game, buy at least super smash on gc. bottom line, this stinks"
1,Flimsy and not sticky,"These don't work very well. They don't stick, and even when reinforced with extra tape (which shouldn't be necessary), they fray and fall apart quickly."
3,Pretty good deal,They do not stick very long when using on toes after surgery. Out in the open they work fine.
3,Decent,"Decent bangages that stay on reasonably well. The flanges are not as wide as I had hoped in order to wrap further around the digit. The second layer of backing on the adhesive is not folded which makes it difficult to remove that piece of backing without either sticking your fingers in the adhesive or touching the sterile non-stick pad. I prefer the Xpect brand XL fingertip bandages over these Dynarex brand, but can no longer find them."
3,"For a long-hair dog, it doesn't last forever","I've got an American Eskimo. The brush did it's job for two, three years, but then the wires started to bend."
4,Good stuff,"This old (1983) recording of Smokey Wilson is very good. I enjoy his later offering as well. This recording also is memorable because of the personal, Rod Piazza on harp, Hollywood Fats on guitar, Larry Taylor on bass. The incendiary guitar of Smokey Wilson lights up the sound and his gruff voice though not the greatest, demonstrates his passion for the blues. The music is infectious blues rock, which I recommend to any blues lover."
2,Was this really written by Stephanie Laurens?,"After Gabriel's great story I had such high hopes for Lucifer, only to be oh so disappointed. This was even less entertaining than Vane's story. This one I couldn't even really finish. I can't tell you how many pages I skipped. I didn't care about the characters at all and the heroine was just boring. At least I liked Patience, I didn't have any emotions whatsoever for Phyllida. Overall my least favorite Cynster novel and a sad way to end the Bar Cynster series. The epilogue was the best part of the book and is why I gave it 2 stars instead of 1."
5,Delightful!,I have read all of her Cynster novels and each one was wonderful. This does not disappoint.
3,Weak Cynster installment,"As a big fan of Stephanie Laurens and the Cynster clan, I found this installment to be a big disappointment. The novel was heavy on plot, heavy on sex and short on romance. The fact that the hero gave in to the ""Cynster curse"" practically from page one took away the joy of the journey. Nevertheless, I was glad to revisit the other Cynsters and see ""happily ever after."" Hopefully the twins' stories will be more engaging."
3,Written on auto pilot,"After greatly enjoying the 5th installment in this series, this 6th book, I found to be routine and predictable. No smoldering passion, no tension. All in all, very dry, no surprises whatsoever. Written on auto pilot."
3,Unfulfilling,"Well, I have read most of the other works in this series and I have to say that I was expecting better. I did love the intrigue, keeps you guessing for awhile. Honestly, I was expecting Lucifer, the male lead character to procrastinate a little more on the idea of him finding his true love. He was extremely adamant about not marrying, yet we don't hear much protesting at all after the third chapter. Hmmm.Save your money-check it out at your library instead."
2,NOT IMPRESSED,"This is the first SL book I've read, and I was not impressed. I picked up right away that this is a series, but this book did not inspire me to order the other books. Not a keeper. I found it fairly boring and was not wild about the hero."
1,Not worth the Wait,"After reading the first books of this series, I was waiting for this one impatiently. I loved Devil's Bride and A secret Love. The others and this new one bored me to tears. The male characters had major potential. She destroyed the book for me by putting stupid women as their mates. Give me someone with brains over wimpering anytime."
2,Very Tedious,"This is my first Stephanie Laurens book. I picked it up after reading the reviews here. I found the book difficult to finish and tedious in some parts. However, I haven't given up on Stephanie Laurens books. I already have Scandal's Bride with me and plan to start on it soon."
2,Disappointing,"I read ""Devil's Bride"" first and I think it ruined me the for the rest of the series! I have found all of the other Cynster males to pale beside Devil, and Honoria was a fabulous heroine. I have reread ""Devil's Bride"" more than I want to admit. Hopefully the books about the twins will be more interesting since it will from a woman's perspective. I think Ms. Laurens is a talented writer, but Lucifer's story in particular was stuffy and boring (although the romantic/sex passages are always entertaining!)."
3,buy it,"This is my favorite of Bar Cynster series and the first one I read. The characters are engaging, the mystery is enough to keep the plot moving and the whole thing is beautifully written. Wonderfully balanced and intelligent."
2,All this in nine days?,"This book is simply too crammed together. The reader is expected to believe that in the space of nine days, Lucifer (Alasdair Cynster) decides to settle down in a part of the country he's never been before on his unexpected inheritance (which hurries along much more rapidly than matters proceeded through probate back then), is welcomed into the local society without any of the hesitation that's common in rural areas and small towns, falls in love with a young woman he had never seen or heard of before, gets her to reciprocate, and solves a mystery.There's no apparent reason for it to be so crammed together. The whole would have worked better if the author had given herself sufficient elapsed-plot-time to develop the social interactions more believably."
4,very good but not the best!,I think this one was enjoyable but I gave it 4 stars because I was really coming down off a high from the previous Cynster novel about Gabriel. THAT one was a firestarter!
2,BORING!!!,"This book was so boring that I couldn't even finish it. The plot was not interesting and the characters were blah! This is the last book I'll be reading by this author for a while. I have read a couple of her other books that were better than ok, but this one was definitely not hitting it."
1,I tried to finish this book...,"I've tried to finish this book several times, I just can't. I don't care how it ends. This book is so bad, that it has deterred me from ever reading another one of Ms. Laurens' books again. A lot of pages filled with words just to make the book longer. That's the best way to describe it. She's filled page after page with a bunch of mumbo jumbo to make a book, and I couldn't force myself to read it all. I tried.... thumbs down. And I love this genre..."
3,complex story,"I agree with the author's philosophy.The story is complex. For an experienced writer, it would have beenchallenging, but for a first time novelist, Miss LaGreca selected a toughie.Whilst I was reading the novel, I heard myself saying, ""oh no,"" a lotbecause the plot was so predictable. But there is a plot, and the descriptionsare stylized."
4,A very entertaining and wonderful read,"I liked this story a lot. It is plot driven, which keeps the characters moving and interesting. The characters are well drawn and the theme involves government controlled medicine with both its intended and unintended consequences. The medicine is definitely exciting and realistic enough to add drama to the story. But mostly, there are enough plot twists to keep the reader guessing and which make reading it fun. This is a very good first novel. I recommend it highly."
3,Thought provoking,"I almost gave up on this book in the first few chapters. It just didn't grab my attention in the beginning like I thought it would, however I'm very glad I pressed forward as I ultimately found it to be quite a page turner and very thought provoking for those debating the Universal Health Care issue. As a medical professional I could appreciate how well researched the book is however, on the downside, I found some aspects were a little over the top (ie. too unrealistic in my opinion) and I had a hard time getting past that. I also felt that many of the romantic descriptions dragged on a little too long where I found myself skimming through them to get to the good parts."
3,Tries a little too hard,"When I read that this book was the ""Medical Fountainhead,"" I just had to read it. Local bookstores don't carry it, so I had to special order from Amazon.Being in the healthcare field (dentist), this is a topic that's near and dear to me....but it was just a little too predictable, as if she set out to write the ""medical Fountainhead.""If you believe in her philosophy (I do), then you will like this book's message, but find the story kind of weak. If you are a died in the wool socialist/government healthcare/populist kind of person, you will find it to be uninspired propaganda.I wouldn't recommend my friends buy this book, but they are welcome to borrow mine.Or better yet, tell them to read Fountainhead and make the leap themselves."
1,"noble vision, not very noble or visionary","This book could have been written by the insurance companies who would not like to see universal healthcare come into existence in the US. If you look at other countries where universal healthcare works, it does not resemble the picture painted here. Reader beware. this is a very slanted book."
1,Neuro-ego,The negative attitude toward the state insurance establishment was too zealous for me! The story initially grabbed my interest but then rapidly deteriorated as things became both ridiculous and predictable. It seemed like most of the characters were whiny and overly dramatic.
1,Melodramatic OMG !,"If you were around in the 70s for soaps like ""Another World ""or ""Secret Storm"" this is the book for you .You can almost hear cheesy organ music as you read. not my thing !"
3,"Good story, but a bit predictable at times","The best part of this novel, for me, was the detailed medical aspect of this unusual injury and the red-tape that seems to be preventing the best doctors from practicing medicine in a political climate of ""free"" health care. It was thought provoking, and highlighted some of the problems that could really happen in real life if a health care system such as what is described in this book was actually in place.The plot itself, a love story, is fairly predictable but did have a few moments where I was slightly surprised. The characters are relatable, with the exception of the fact that most men don't speak and/or write the way this doctor does, and the action moves quickly. It's an easy read with a nice story - nothing spectacular but worth the low price."
3,Riveting until...,"I was absolutely enthralled and captivated til about two thirds of the way through. Then for the last third or so, the story line got very sappy, slightly predictable with a few twists but with the predicted outcome."
5,True eye opener,This is a story of a beautiful ballerina and the doctor who falls in love with her. Throughout the book she has no idea who her secret admirer is as she struggles through blindness caused by a fall of the stage that was her universe and a doctor who fights against all those who get in his way to save the sight of his lady-love.This is the first book I read by Gen LaGreca. She is quickly becoming one of my favorite authors.
5,FANTASTIC BOOK!!,"If this is LaGreca's first novel, I can not wait to read her future novels. This book was so well written, I did not have to ""skip"" over any pages & found it difficult to put down. I would like to see this novel made into a movie , especially today, to show how destructive government run health care can be with the government, not the doctor, deciding who receives health care. This book could not be written at a greater time."
5,A very good read!!!,"I had to stay awake and finish this book last night. Even though it is fiction, there is a lot of truth in the risk to the US health care system if healthcare reform becomes more political and less patient centered."
3,"The Drive is great, perfect for my laptop computer.","THIS DRIVE HAS A 6 PIN FIREWIRE CONNECTION, AND THE ONLY CABLE IT COMES WITH HAS THE 6 PIN CONNECTOR ON BOTH SIDES, AMAZON.COM DOESN'T GIVE THIS INFORMATION. THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE MOST FIREWIRE PORTS I HAVE SEEN ARE THE SMALLER 4 PIN, YOU NEED A SPECIAL CABLE TO GO FROM 4 PIN TO 6 PIN.Other than that the drive is great, it has 2 firewire ports so you can daisy chain mutiple drives or firewire devices, the drives say they are stackable but that doesn't mean you can stack two and they become one, it just means they can sit ontop of each other. I don't anticipate ever needing more than 80Gb + the 20Gb I have now. I would choose some word other than stackable, a Cisco 1300 series switch is stackable this hard drive isn't."
1,Lasted almost 45 whole days!,"I got mine in December. Installation was pretty easy and everything worked great. Fast enough and plenty of storage for a good price.Then one day it just didn't work anymore. But it was about 45 days old so it was now in LaCie's hands for warranty.LaCie authorized to open it and take the IDE drive out and install it in my PC. Didn't work. Wouldn't even power up.Sent back to LaCie on my FedEx dime and they turned it around with a new drive the same day. Sent on Friday (2 day air) and got it back Thursday next.I asked for a cross-ship of a new one since it was essentially a new drive but they wouldn't do it. I had to strong-arm LaCie a bit to let me open and test it. Once it was sent back, though, they turned it right around so that part was good service.Too bad I bought it for a backup and storage drive and all my data is gone.My wife may never forgive me for losing those files.nice drive but don't trust your data on it."
3,OK kind of drive,"I purchased it from my University Book-Store and could not return it as they had ""no return"" policy on opened products. The problem I face with this drive is the heavy weight ( more than 3 pounds ) and the need to attach power cord with adaptor. All this makes the hard drive not so portable. I would rather go for something which fits in my pocket and is USB powered."
3,R and B Fun .....,"This is a fun album to listen to. It is not an album you will say ""wow"" about after listening to it. It did not win any Grammies or other awards, but the lyrics are clever and her voice is full of soul and experience.The session musicians are good and stay out of the way of what counts - R and B singer E.C., soulfully and playfully singing clever lyrics. Very good album."
5,Great New Talent !!!!,"Loved EVERY song on this CD... Keith Anderson and his entire band rock... Their music gets you moving and it makes you want to listen to it over and over again....Had the opportunity to see him live in Ft Worth TX a few weeks back before I listened to his CD... His performance was just as great in person as it is on this CD... As far as being a great entertainer, he's a 10 in my book.."
1,Anderson who?,"This Album has new anti-piracy technology on it. I'm all for having the Artists get their fair share of money, but when I purchase an album I expect to be able to use it on all of my media devices, but I can't use it on the device I use the most, which is my sony HD-3 Mp3 player. So if you have a sony mp3 player save your money and buy another CD."
3,the book is better.,"I'm watching this movie as I write this review and I must say that the book is much better than the movie. I laughed at the montage between Breur and Nietzche, rolled my eyes at the awful computer graphics when the dream sequences showed, and the consistent aghast look on Breur's face is kind of annoying. Nice flanger on the Wagner music. Anyway, I'll finish it and let it be."
3,Surprisingly decent especially for an adaptation...,"...based on the novel by Irvin Yalom.The cast is quite good, with Armand Assante as Nietzsche, Ben Cross as Dr. Breur, and especially the suitably luscious-but-spunky Katheryn Winnick as Lou Salome. Like the book, the plot could use some editing and tightening. The dream sequences were quite entertaining, if a bit intrusive, but this is in keeping with the subject matter---the movie is really as much about psychoanalytic theory as it is about Nietzsche's philosophy. Cinematography was also excellent, the film is visually lush. About the only giveaway that this is a low-budget, small-studio film was the production values in the dream sequences, especially the computer-generated effects.Overall I enjoyed it, though doubtful I would really want to watch it again or own the movie."
2,Disappointing,"I thought this movie was ridiculous. What were they thinking? I was hoping for a serious movie on this very complex man, and wound up watching something that struck me as totally absurd. Glad I didn't spend more money on it than I did."
1,When Moviegoers Wept,"Reduces the culture-changing ideas of Breuer, Freud, Nietzsche, and von Salome to a series of pop-psychology soundbites.A ""period piece"" in which the actresses and actors have visibly modern makeup, hair styles, and clothing.Slapstick action and flat acting."
3,Basil or the Basil's Legend?,"A very nice book but, warning!, this everything but a biography: more than half of this book is dedied to the historical image of the Bulgar Slayer in the balcanic history AFTER the historical Basil. People looking a biography of Basil for may find it not so interessant..."
5,Artistic Exploration,"First time reviewer, but I'm feeling strongly about this.Time and again, you will enjoy how Maria Rita takes risks with the minimal approach -- often simply ""torch"" piano, percussion and vocals.She succeeds because she fills a song with her voice and expression/interpretation. This is a real artist, who grabs the listener with less and leaves them with more. The arrangements are spare and elegant.Wow, this is some talent. Those who love her mother's (Elis Regina) wonderful contributions will find her daughter to be equally captivating as a musical force, but far more discerning. I find my ear trusting her incredible control of pitch and breath. She is expressive, but never leaves the music behind. This is an extremely intimate production.You will listen over and over to this. It's like Brazilian jazz on haiku.Enjoy!"
5,Love it,"I love it, I love it, I love it! Simple actions you can take to improve your attitude and get your life moving in a positive direction. Not boring, stuffy or overly complicated. Making lists to keep you in the right direction. Overcoming fear. Making focus easier. Even liveable dietary advice- IF you want/need it! No psychological ""mumbo jumbo""-- just practical, doable, useful advice. Your new mantra: ""Make it happen."" :)"
1,The File On Thelma Jordan,"An excellent movie marred by a dreadful dvd release. The picture is very pixelated and is of an extremely poor quality. Afer watching it for 2 minutes I stopped it. I could not stand to see such a great movie given such a pathetic dvd release. In addition, there is no art work on the cover. It has nothing going for it. Don't waste for your money. My VHS version which I recorded from television years ago is far superior to this rubbish. Amazon should remove this item. A shocker!!!"
1,Quality of the picture of this movie,"Unfortunately, the quality of this movie was absolutely, completely awful - not even watchable. It was like a worn tape had been transposed to disc. Abysmal."
5,Where is DUSTY,"I'm collecting Louis Jordan movies because I'm searching for one where he has Dusty Fletcher doing the ""Open The Door Richard' routine. I saw it many years ago but I can't remember the movie. Still, I enjoy Louis Jordan and the boys for their music. Beware Brother Beware!"
1,Poor Design,"Very disappointed Kitchenaid fan. This spatula is not only way WAY too large to be useful and poorly balanced, but also it's sister product (the short turner) broke recently when dealt some routine cooking abuse. Snapped right at that pretty narrow neck. Futhermore, the plastic handles are not heatproof like the silcone, so if you leave it leaning on the pan or the stove, it will melt. What's the point of silcone then?"
1,Horrible,"Buyers beware, I have had the spatula a few weeks and it started to fall apart, peeling on the sides and I have only used it a few times. It looked nice but does not hold up."
2,Too Large and Flimsy,"I suppose to some...this might be the spatula to end all spatulas, but to me....it was too large....and too flimsy to satisfy my desires. It's one of those few items that I should've looked at physically before buying. I wasn't overly comfortable about the size and the feel of the tool. It was larger than it had to be, and almost as limp as a noodle. It did have some redeeming qualities however....so I gave it 2 stars. I wound up giving this utensil to my daughter who's just starting out in life on her own. As for me....I found another more to my liking, one that I was able to physically check out thoroughly before buying.J.B. KruzKruzKontrol"
3,Good but not the best,I don't mind that the spatula is flimsy as mentioned by other reviewers. The reason I gave it 3 stars is that the spatula is not completely heat resistant. The hard plastic handle is not heat resistant. I was cooking some food in the oven and I had left the spatula on the top of my range/oven. The heat from the oven melted the handle and now it is permanently warped.
2,Looking for a better spatula,"The edge of the spatula, after only two weeks, has started to fall off in little pieces. I only washed it in soapy warm water and was very careful every time. I read other reviews that said this was a problem. I thought if I was very careful it wouldn't happen. But it did. I will return it."
5,Flipping,"Now, instead of getting egg all under my fingernails I can use this spatula to flip them over.Great huh?"
2,Not for small hands,"This product stands up to heavy use without fraying or melting. My only complaint, and it's a significant one, is the shape of the handle. I find it awkward and clunky. It's probably great for people with larger hands. I've decided to replace mine with cheaper ones."
1,No Dirty Deal Here,From the first listen to this disc I was enthralled! It is great! Can't wait to see him live!
4,I'm dancin' the boogie!,"This compilation is probably one of the most well-rounded rock 'n roll and rhythm and blues Christmas collections ever assembled. It features big hits by the Chipmunks, Charles Brown and the Beach Boys, but the rest of the material is not that well known. Not all of it is great, but that's to be expected. You get some great rock, R&B and even some silly novelties. ""I Want Elvis For Christmas"", indeed! A lot of this material is hard to find, so this CD is worth seeking out."
5,Christmas Treasure,I had this on cassette years ago but then we moved and I think it got lost in it. I had always liked I Want Elvis For Christmas and all the other ones including the Bobby Goldsboro one so when I found this available on cd one day while looking through his cds I snached it up. It has always been an excellent album.
4,It works,"I bought the spray with the spray collar. Spray does work for the most part, especially in the beginning when the dog is not sure what is going on with the spray. Effect slowly diminishes after a while and does not work as well. Smell of citronella all the time isn't that great, however."
5,great service,"Item being reviewedBOX 0f 6 Multivet Premier citronella bark dog spray collar refillsalso got a box of a 6volt batteries...wonderful, fast service..."
4,Buyer Beware!,"This DVD is the EXACT SAME DVD that has also been sold as the Montreal Jazz Festival performance from 1982. It's a decent performance, and a must have for Jaco addicts like myself. I didn't realize that it was the exact same concert though, just with a different name, so now I have to screw around with sending it back for a refund."
2,It's hard to watch stars fade...,"Though this DVD can be good for archival purposes and those fans that have to see everybit of footage about or including Jaco, I found it missing in many areas. Jaco looks slightly bored and like he is preoccupied. He struggles in spots to come up with solos and as a result, the times that feature him are not fluid. That being said, the parts that come out are amazing and fun to litsen to, but you really need to listen for them. In fact, I have marked a couple of the high points so that I can go back and watch them later, because I don't think that I will ever sit down and listen to the whole DVD again."
4,WWJD (What Would Jaco Do?),"Everybody, including all bass players that really matter, are in agreement that Jaco was the undisputed KING OF THE ELECTRIC BASS. Indeed, and I'm not being facetious when I say this, he was to the electric bass what one Charles Mingus was to the standup bass. MY question: if Jaco only needed (and used) 4 strings, why do you see every current d!p$h!+ ""bass player"" playing a five or even six string bass? I gave this 4 stars because it's Jaco and it's ""live,"" but I read elsewhere that this's already been issued under another name. Regardless: get this, that Jaco ""how to"" thing, and (try to do the impossible and TUNE OUT) Joni Mitchell's ""Shadows & Light."" Jaco's absolutely irreplaceable."
4,A perfect stand for stationary playing,"This is a really sharp looking dulcimer stand. The only drawback is that it doesn't fold flat for traveling without some dismanteling. Other than that, it looks beautiful and is perfect for sitting or standing while you are playing the hammered dulcimer. Delivery was quick and the limited necessary assembly was simple with the clearly marked directions that accompanied the dulcimer stand."
4,FutureShine for paint,I am very pleased with FutureShine. It has provided a nice mix in my paints for surfboard finishing. It has given my boards a nice finished look.
2,Not the best floor polish,"I bought this product because my floor is in desperate need of a good sealant. I have used mop n glo in the past and loved how good the floor shined afterwards. I also loved how easy it was to apply.Unfortunately, this was not the case with this product. It was suggested to use a sponge mop for application, which made bubbles that dried into the floor. I found out later that the best method to apply the polish was with a small cloth. I mixed in a little water which made it even easier to apply. But no matter how I applied it, it always dried unevenly and left streaks. Even the best portions of my floor didn't hold as good of a shine as the mop'n'glo did. I'll be ordering mop'n'glo as soon as I'm finished writing this review.I know a lot of people love this product for their home hobbies and such. I just wish it worked well on a floor like it is designed."
3,floorshine,I thought that both of these bottles were a product I bought before but they do not appear the same. They do not even look like each pther even though I bought 2 of the same items!
1,Future Floor Wax,customer service is really really BAD!!!!!They do not know how to answering the phone and RUDE!!!!!
5,Makes Floors Look New Again,"Pledge Future is sometimes hard to find in stores, so I bought it online. My floors are 20 years old, but look brand new when I apply Pledge Future Shine and the shine lasts a long time. I won't use anything else."
5,New use for floor wax,"Future Shine floor wax is a great adhesive for gluing small plastic window panes in frames of HO scale windows mainly because when it dries, it's clear as if nothing was there. Using regular glues for this results in huge smears on the panes that is etched into the plastic. Not so with Future."
3,Not what it used to be,"Floor-not as shiny... this stuff isn't what it used to be. I have been looking for it for a super long time, happy to find it, but it didn't work life I remembered. No...shellac shine anymore."
4,good finish,"I make polymer clay jewelry and some people have recommended this as a finish for the polymer clay pieces. I tried it and it seems to work well, but I still prefer hand sanding and buffing."
5,Great for figures,"Like many other people, I didn't actually buy this to wax my floors with. Though if it performs as well as it does on floors as it does on some of the other stuff I've used it on, I would never use another product on them (if, you know, I didn't have wall to wall carpeting).I'm sure buy now many toy collectors have heard about this stuff and think people are exaggerating how well it works for the things it's been reported to do (adding great reflecting shine to figures and tightening their joints, all without harming the paint or plastic like some other methods can), well it's true! This stuff is almost litarally liquid miracles for that kind of stuff and I highly recommenced it to everyone."
5,A Book for all Seasons,"Anita Nygaard was a good friend of mine. She loved nature and the outdoors, and this is reflected in her book. She describes each day of the calendar year in a very loving, special way. This is a book you will never stop reading. Pick it up any day of the year, and Anita will describe this day to you."
4,Delicious,This jello is delicious but it would be nice if I could order multiple flavors in smaller quantities. That would be perfect.
4,Attractive Men,"After reading the book Like Water for Chocolate, I don't that the men in Esquivel's novle are weak, even unappealing characters. Esquivel doesn't bash men unfairly. In contrast, she describes men exactly depending on their jobs or their characters. In this novel, we can see two attractive men: John and Juan. The first attractive man is Dr.John"
2,Everything but the kitchen sink!,"The author has enough idea to write a dozen books. Unfortunately he puts them all into one book!As something to read while on a trip this book is ok. But if you are looking for any true story development or plot, forget it! Magic, PSI, Dragons, High Tech civilizations, mysterious relics, elves, werewolves etc. they are all in there somewhere!If the author used about 1/5th the ideas he put in the book then he could have had a good novel."
3,Not Original Recordings,"When is somebody going to release a CD of Original Del Reeves Recordings????????? The 10 songs contained on this album, are indeed Del Reeves, but are not the original recordings; these recordings, while not bad, are later remakes. The songs contained here are: Girl on the Billboard; Good Time Charlies; Belles of Southern Bell; Looking at the World through a Windshield; Be Glad; Women Do Funny Things to Me; Philadelphia Fillies; A DIme at a Time; A Lover's Question; and This Must Be the Bottom. Del deserves to have his catalog of material to be rereleased in their original form, and I'll be the first in line to purchase a copy."
1,Fake made in China knockoff,"I have used British Sterling cologne for many years. This is not the real thing. It is a thinned out, cheap rip-off of a very good product. There is a label underneath the bottle stating it is ""made in China with Fragrance oil made in USA"". Even the cap came apart after opening it a few times."
1,not the same,"Let's be clear that my complaint is NOT with this vendor,but rather the product itself. I have used BS aftershave for years, and this just does not smell the same. Way too sweet and reminds me of cheap colognes. Has a hint of the old Canoe fragrance, which I stopped liking years ago. Unfortunately, this is not an imitation, but the real thing that just seems different. Was glad to see others comments as I thought I was losing my mind. Have to wait for recycling day, as I wouldn't throw this product down the drain; might kill Carp!"
1,Almost no scent,"Don't know if this is a fake or not but it's virtually worthless as a cologne. My husband used this scent for years and we all loved it. This is the first time I have purchased it in a long time. Don't know if it has changed or not, but will not buy it again."
4,British sterling,This has been my father Christmas gift for most of my adult life. I enjoy the the memory of he getting dress for Chruch and he would wear this. My mother started this gift giving :)
3,Going back to PS,"British Sterling Cologne is fairly decent in my opinion, though I feel it doesn't last very long. I haven't received nearly as many compliments from it like I did when I would wear Paul Sebastian (save for someone who thought I was wearing baby powder). It was nice to experiment with a different cologne, but I think I'll go back to what I was using beforehand (shall we say I'm dropping the BS and going back to PS :P)."
5,British Sterling Cologne for Men,"British Sterling Cologne is my fovorite cologne, and I have used it for many years. I know that I can find it at Amazon."
1,saving stuff,"I don't need this book. I thought it was a book on saving things that don't matter, or that does matter. Files, odds and ends. I needed a organizer of house items Its primarlily antiques."
5,Excellent Reference,I've read this book cover to cover -- and regularly refer to it as a reference. Covers a broad range of common heirloom preservation issues in a very readable and often humorous style.
3,A good reference,I have only glanced through the book but know I will refer back to it not only for my own collections but also for the museum where I am a volunteer.
5,Green Thumbs Up!,"Shovel It: Nature's Health Plan by Eva Shaw,Ph.D.is a must have during these turbulant times. Each chapter is an adventure, filled with down to earth (excuse the pun) healthful, helpful stategies.Working the soil with my hands has become a spiritual, calming and most importantly, a healing experience. This text is written in a candid and refreshing manner. I, a confirmed couch potatoe, now enjoy gardening. In the process, discovered that even I could have ""a green thumb"".Please, if life has lost its joy, buy this book. Read it, even if you never touch soil, but I think you will."
5,Blazing Blues Guitar and soulful vocals,"One listen to this CD and you will be hooked! Every song on this offering is different but all amazing. Too bad the boy can't play guitar! (only kidding). If you think the CD is good, try and check out a live performance! Coco, if you're listening, come back to San Diego! Again and again and again........."
5,THIS IS ONE FABULOUS CD!,"THIS WILL BECOME ONE OF YOUR MOST PLAYED CD'S. COCO IS ""ONE OF THE BEST"" GUITARISTS IN THE WORLD. ADD THIS AND THE REST OF HIS CD'S TO YOUR COLLECTION AND YOU WON'T BE SORRY. HE ALSO PUTS ON A FANTASTIC SHOW THAT MIGHT POSSIBLY LEAVE YOU BREATHLESS."
4,Coco Montoya - Solo Debut From Blues Veteran,"Montoya is yet another blues guitarist that I have been introduced to through our local blues series. I have seen him live twice and really enjoy his brand of blues. This was Coco's first solo album, but is a blues veteran who cut his teeth in both John Mayhal's and Albert Collins bands. Montoya has a smooth effortless guitar style and a very nice voice to go with it. His songwriting is already that of a seasoned blues performer. There is lots of tasty guitar to be found here especially on the closing track, Am I Loosing You. I think this ranks up with Montoya's best albums and if you are a fan of well done blues this would be worth checking out."
4,Coco is good,"Coco Montoya used to play drums for Albert Collins. Albert taught Coco to play guitar and it was a case of the student exceeding his teacher. This is a good album. Coco's phrasing and singing rank him with some of the best. There are many great tracks. I recommend this album and the other Coco Montoya albums. If you enjoy this, also check out 'Life in the Jungle' with John Mayall and Walter Trout."
3,A little more 'country music' than 'blues',"Have to admit I have not listened to this disc very much... but am somewhat disappointed with it so far. The guitar on this album lacks that raw, innovative, edge that I heard Coco play on some of John Mayall’s songs. Also, the lyrics didn’t seem all that creative as one other reviewer suggested. However, I am obviously in the minority on this. .... ...."
5,First rate historical fiction for girls,"I highly recommend any of Watson's books for pre-teen and teenage girls. These are heroines that are truly great role models for girls: smart, brave, and unusual. Lark is a naive, adventure-seeking daughter of Cavaliers who runs away and meets up with a like-minded young man in Cromwell's England. The appealing story has Lark play-acting her way in and out of danger from ""Roundheads"", gypsies, and other characters. Although the story is a bit ""out there"" (yes, she really does help the young Charles II escape from Cromwell's soldiers!), it always seems real in very important ways. She learns important values about pre-judging people, looking at all sides of an issue, and learning who her real friends are. It is truly a shame that these wonderful books are out of print and so expensive. I read my way through all of them in my school library, and I wish they were still around for other girls."
4,Covers all the basics for 3 rail wiring,"This book provides the basics of everything you need to know about 3-rail train wiring. Especially helpful is the section on wiring blocks, hooking up and phasing multiple transformers, and wiring accessories.Note 1: This covers AC wiring. There are other books that cover 2-rail DC wiring (there are differences!)Note 2: For the toy train newbie. If the book cover contains the text ""Classic Toy Trains"" it's primary concern is 3-rail and O or S scale. If the text says ""Model Railroader"", it's primary concern is 2-rail HO and N scale. This is good to know so that you don't spend your money on books that are not applicable to your layout."
2,Too sweet for me too,"Though the texture is hearty and thick, this soup tastes way too sweet for me. Is it really necessary to add 14g of evaporated cane juice to a soup?"
1,Sweet - not in a good way,"Warning - this soup is very very sweet. After trying to disguise the sweetness with salt & spicy seasonings I poured out most of the can, and I have a sweet tooth. I'm puzzled by the 5 star reviews."
5,Last Hurrah from the Historic Lineup,"Having just purchased The last studio recording with the MKII lineup, The Battle Rages On, I was interested in hearing their final recordedlive performances in Europe, so I purchased the 4-CD set. The Stuttgard shows are definitely the highlights, and the entire band has never been better. My personal favorite from TBRO is Anya, and the 12+ minute version here is some of the best live heavy-metal-thunder-rock-and-rollthat you will ever hear. I've never been a Ritchie Blackmore fan, though I've always liked his sound, but on ""Anya"" he RIPS like nothing I've ever heard. The backfill of the drums and organ absolutely POUND this song into the stratosphere and Blackmore's guitar pyrotechnics keep itthere as he rifles riff after riff as the crowd chants ""Go, go go."" I've never heard anything better recorded live. I only wish there was a DVD togo along with it! Long live Deep Purple!!"
4,End of an era,"Four songs from the final Blackmore album ""The Battle Rages On"" (The Battle Rages On, Anya, Talk About Love, A Twist In The Tale) as well as the classic hits you'd expect, add up to the final days of Deep Purple's MK II lineup. Before the final dates of this tour, Richie Blackmore would be gone for the last time (with Joe Satriani stepping in to perform the remaining dates). This isn't the best MK II Deep Purple you've heard, and it also isn't the worst. Fans of the classic lineup won't be disappointed, but don't confuse ""Stuttgart 1993"" with ""Made In Japan."" It's an official release on Song BMG, so it's not a bootleg...always the first thing you want to check on any ""from the vault"" DP releases."
1,I can't believe I read 100 pages without napping...zzzzzz!,"Usually I find if I can't get past page 40 in a book, I give it up, but I hung in for 100 LONG PAGES! I thought something was wrong with me! Then I realized why I lasted so long...I did some of my own ""Evelyn Wood Speedreading"" to get through the boring descriptions, daydreaming and jumping all over the place! I thought it was poorly written since it did not keep my attention at all. Skipping over many pages was the best thing I ever did. Now, returning it to the library will be the next best thing! I believe because I just finished an ""Iris Johansen"" novel (The Killing Game)...(a book I REALLY couldn't put down!) is probably why this book was such a disappointment."
5,Truly Great!!,"I'm shocked so many readers didn't like this one! True, not all KS's books are great, but this one had everything; originality, romance, suspense, questionable loyalty, and intrigue. All the characters were very realistic. Caitlin, a wonderful woman, and Jesse, mysterious and sexy, were fabulously paired. Jesse's twin, Patrick was a nice guy but I didn't see him as a very romantic man."
5,This book was very enjoyable.,I recommend this book to all. It was excellent. One of best books I have read so for this year.
1,Skip this one!,"I am a big fan of Katherine Stone books, but Thief of Hearts was a big disppointment. Poorly written and not very exciting. If you want to read one her better works, try Imagine Love or Pearl Moon."
4,Good could have been better,"The title of this book should have been ""Misunderstanding"" That is what this book is about. The misunderstanding between 2 brothers, between friends and lovers etc. Surgeon Caitlin Taylor's friend and coworker is dying. He needs a bone marrow. Caitlin is the only one that knows her friend has a brother a twin brother. A brother he hasn't spoken to in many years. Caitlin finds the twin, falls in love and tries to save her friend. Read this book to find out what happens. You won't be disappointed..."
2,Good,"Not a bad product, but not great either, from the description, I expected it to do a better job."
1,Very disatisfied,"Do not buy from this company. I ordered this ""ensemble"" for a Christmas gift but only received the comforter. No sheets arrived. When I inquired about it, there were no sheets left even tho I paid for them."
2,Too small,"The dimensions for this bucket are for the outside, including the lips of the bucket. The inside dimensions are much smaller, and won't work for what I needed. I'm sure it's a great, sturdy bucket, just not the correct size I needed."
4,"Superb Mixing, Excelent listening for those slow paced days","You'll love it. All I can say is that for those lazy days when all you feel like doing is curling up with a book in bed, this will be the backing music of choice."
3,These Cords Aren't Sized Correctly,"I thought this was a great deal, but you need to order at least one size larger in the waist and hip area if you want to zip them. Otherwise, I liked them!So, great price, good product, order a larger size than you think you will need in the waist and hips. They do not stretch much."
1,never recived it!,I this this company is not professional. Never recieved. I have never had to wait so long for something before! Will never order from this company again!
1,pants review,These were some cords that were nice and suitable for occasionial but not recommended for going out. They are warm and nice looking
4,"If you like this history, Try this book as well....","I would love to find a copy of this book, if anyone has one available for a reasonable price, let me know.I would like to recommend another book on this subject, it is called ""Wine of Satan, A Tale of Bohemond, Prince of Antioch"" by Laverne Gay, printed 1949 by Charles Scribner's Sons, New York. Amazon does not carry it, but it can be found elsewhere.Its well written and Ms. Gay did her research on the period and the people."
1,Not What I Expected,"I downloaded the Kindle version of ""Baby Tips for Dads,"" thinking it was a tip guide for new dads. Turns out this is one of those cute hardcover books that people give as gifts at baby showers. It's full of little comics and very little content. Not a tip guide for father's if that is what you are looking to get."
2,"Not what is pictured, its the replacement with plastic middle hub not metal like original.","This should be changed to the replacement part number which is cheaply made compared to original i payed extra to get the one pictured, disappointed."
2,A bit disappointed,I've seen this documentary for the first time on PBS. They cut some parts off. I hate when they do that. Why don't they just keep it intact.
3,Just viewed,I for one am a big fan of their music but personally the group is a well known train wreck. The great things about the group are quickly overshadowed but John's drug use and 3/4's of the group were moral reprobates. The Mamas and the Papas are a great case study of how wonderful talent and hope is quickly ruined by substance abuse and poor behavior. How many rock bios tell the same sad story?I have mixed emotions about this DVD. If you are a big fan you will want it but how many times can you view the last 45 minutes of it?
4,Educate Thyself - Experience this Album,"If you're reading this review, you're no stranger to the hip-hop community. Sadat X has never experienced solo success, however, he's certainly the heart-and-soul of Brand Nubian. Having said that, Experience & Education is nothing groundbreaking or as classic as previous Brand Nubian releases (dating back to the golden age of hip-hop), but you could make an argument this album was one of the best (and most overlooked) in 2005.The album's highlights Back To New York, God Is Back, What Did I Do?, Ge-ology to name a few - add life into a world of hip-hop that's on the verge of death. Experience & Education is not flawless; in fact - you'll find a handful of filler tracks on this album. If you're a fan of Sadat X, past (Brand Nubian), present (Experience & Education) or future (Black October) do yourself a favor, and buy his best solo work to date."
4,D X from the BX.....,"well well well....what can i say!!!? im a BIG brand nubian fan and a general fan of a lot of the possitive late 80's early 90's hip hop.....as most REAL HIP HOP HEADS know....a time in hip hop where emcees would sit down with a pen and a pad and write counsious down to earth lyrics are slowly fading away!!!.....FOURTUNATELY (female fun records)..knows this to and is helping to put REAL ARTISTS like BRAND NUBIANS sadat x out!!!!.....any ways support sadat x and female fun records and buy this CD.......the beats are on point and sharp, plus ORIGINAL and sadat x's lyrics are well written and you can tell he raps about what he wants to rap about and not whats popular at the time!!! .....SOME VERY DEEP LYRICS...."
4,Great Idea Book,This book is great for design ideas. Better to look before you leap when you are getting ready to spend money and destroy your kitchen or bath.
2,Black and white photos??...,"I finally recieved this item. It was damaged in transit (cover bent), but I overlooked this complaint for a while until I opened the book. ""Tile Your World"" was recommended to me for my project, so this is why I purchased it. But when I saw the bulk of black-and-white photos that you can hardly see (which were also small), I then wondered ""is this for real?"". It is awful-- only the finished jobs are in color. NO how-to book should have small instructional photos in black-and-white, and only invest in putting the finished product in color!!! If you are a new DIYer, please keep this in mind if you order this item. I don't know if I will keep this book-- especially if I can't see exactly what I need to do. I can read all the content I want, but if I can't match it to the photos, it becomes useless to me (and quite a stressful project)."
2,Short on color,"I received my book a few days ago. I must say I was kind of disappointed. To pay $23.95 + shipping for a small paperback book with mostly black and white pictures. I think the book will be a good read and provide me with some good tips, but I think most of the pictures should have at least been in color to really get the ideas across and easy to see. I guess I thought that even though it was a paperback that it would be a larger book with better pictures."
3,"3 and a half stars, pleasant reading, expectations too high","He starts off his book asking the reader to read the book cover to cover. This is not typical for a do it yourself project book. We needed some help on technical questions for a windowsill and backsplash and between reading the book when we can and trying the John Bridge Forum online and asking the specific question (we were unable to find another thread with our answers) we still have no answers. We have been trying to get answers for about 3 weeks now. However, for someone trying to learn masonry this is a good book to add to your library."
5,Fanstastic Book!!!,"Being new to tile work, I was looking for a no nonsense, straight to the point instruction guide. I got that and more. John presents the material in an easy to understand manner. Highly recommended to anyone interested in laying tile or shower building."
4,Spacey,"I thought it was going to be smaller, but it is actually an average size and very spacey, my make-up and other things fit just right."
2,"Great Look and Functionality; but, Design Issue","To be fair, the case is nice looking and very functional; the large trays offer good organizing capacity and there is ample roomy-ness in the compartment below. In the context of its affordability, the one thing that did not satisfy me is the design of the trays and how they connect to the case parts that open every time you use it. Specifically, the hinge construction of the trays seems weak and of lower quality and in addition the trays rub against one another every time you open up the case. This suggested that while the case looks sturdy, the trays may not last as long- I'd prefer that the trays open up manually to prevent the undue wear! In deciding whether to keep it I tried to play up its virtues, but in the end I concluded that my money would be better invested in a different product."
3,It was OKAY.,PROS- Easy to carry around. =)CONS- It is not large enough. Does not fit all my make up =(- The corners get stuck when i try to open it. =(- Does not keep everything in one place after being moved. =(- Total price paid for this item including shipping and handling($59.11)was too much. =(
4,Great look and quality!!,I have several makeup palettes and needed a case with a lot of storage. This one works perfectly and looks fabulous. The hinges and other hardware are good quality and I'm sure this case will last for a very long time!
5,"Awesome Case, Awesome Price!","I got this case because I have a lot of makeup and kids that don't seem to want to leave it alone. It is a great size I was able to fit all my makeup, lotion and perfume in it. It locks and is very sturdy! When closed you can not see anything that is inside. I just wish it had a mirror."
2,Flimsy!,"I opened and closed the case once. The second time I tried, one side did not even open at all. It was stuck! The trays are not flat, but tilt backward. Very poorly made. I am returning!"
4,Functionally fine but I wonder about durability,"I purchased this case from another retailer and am very pleased with it. It organizes my mineral make-up the way I wanted and there is room to spare in the bottom compartment for other beauty products. I almost purchased a more expensive case from a make-up retailer but felt guilty about the price. Although less expensive than the other case I doubt it would hold up as well but I plan to keep mine in my bathroom and not use it for travel. For those purposes it will do just fine. Yes the trays aren't the most sturdy but I'm no professional, just needing a storage solution."
2,Basic,"This is a very basic and simple design. It does what I needed it to do, hold makeup. Though I wish I would have looked around more. I think it's over priced for the quality."
2,Don't think there Crystal!!!!,"I bought these same Candlesticks with a Lenox Sticker on top of both of them, (Did NOT buy from Amazon.)I Don't think there Crystal!To me there is no Sparkle to these, when I put them next to my other Crystal Candlesticks, or just standing alone.There lite in weight,and I can see the seams where the glass was poured in the mold to make these.I find them to look small and punny, next to any of my other Crystal Candlesticks,Maybe there cute to use for everyday, but I would not use these for a dinner party, or company.After the shipping cost , you could buy a nicer Pair of Crystal Candlesticks for a little more money.They do seem to be balanced ok, as they do not fall over.I think there Glass but I could be wrong!"
2,"Doesn't fit my 3/8"" square spit rod","I wanted these for my Weber Summit gas grill to cook smaller items on the rotisserie since it has four closely spaced prongs while the forks that came with my grill have two prongs that are farther apart. The description says that these fit a 3/8"" spit rod, which I thought would be perfect for the rod that came with my grill which is 3/8"" square. They don't say in the description that they meant a 3/8"" round spit rod. Therefore, these don't fit the rod in the Summit grill. I'm going to try to grind out the hole with a rotary tool, but then will lose the finish in four spots which will result in it rusting at those points. My complaint is why don't any of these products (not just rotisserie accessories,) specify what they fit in both size and shape?"
2,Too small,These are too small to be much use. They are barely half as large as the meat forks that came with my rotisserie. They might work on something small like a Cornish hen.
1,junk liteweight worthless,"Not heavy duty at all. Not sure it will hold anything.I ordered two sets and am going to throw them away, not going to waste postage to return. I'm surprised Amazon would sell this junk,a mistake I will not repeat.GrillPro 60120 Replacement Rotisserie Meat Forks"
4,Rico's view!,At first I thought that they were a little flimsy but after using them they work fine. Cannot beat the price. Very happy with them. Only can give them 4 stars because they were not included for free shipping!! Oh well!
1,Nifty 600638 Catch-All Front Floor Mats - Set of 2,"I purchased these for my 2003 Yukon XL. I purchased a full set for the front, middle and back footwells and a cargo liner for the cargo area. All fit fine except the drivers front, it doesn't fit at all. It doesn't fit the shape or size of footwell and it begins to curl up as it ages. I even had the manufacturer send me a replacement set for the front in case there was a bad production run and the second set is no better. I could not possibly recommend this product. I feel that it is a safety hazard it is so poor fitting."
2,Great but they dont last,They look like they would be more durable than factory mats. But have gone thru two sets. Liked them so much so after 3 years bought another set hopeing I was just unlucky. The second set also lasted only 3 years before they got a hole in them. They seem to be bad about where they have the heel area/pad. They put in wrong place and dont test it.For the money should last longer than 3 years. Even cheapest mat will. And I only drive 7K-10K miles a year.
2,Not so great,"The mats do not stay n place with the snaps. For the money the quality is just average. The mats have been un snapping from the clips and when I contacted the manufacture I kept being passed on the someone else. Finally got someone and all they have agreed to do is send me new fasteners. Wow, brand new product and I have to replace the fasteners.Would not purchase again"
3,Missing Three Billy Goats Gruff,"I was disappointed that this book lacks the Three Billy Goats Gruff, which is what I was looking for when I got this book."
5,Aggressive,I saw fern play in Green Bay with the Goo Goo Dolls. I've been a fan ever since. The album is a must-buy if you want to rock. It's full of hooks and quality music that will last through all the styles/fads and stand the test of time. Great work guys!
3,"Great chef, average cookbook.","There is no denying Alain Ducasse is the chef of the moment. However, this book was somewhat of a disappointment. The recipes are interesting, the photography decent. But the problem lies in the ingredients. Too many recipes call for ingredients that are flat out impossible to find - and he offers no alternatives. It is one thing to ask for truffles, caviar, or duck confit. It is another to require specific mediterranean fish that are not found in this country, or obscure wild game and offal that cannot be had. Substituting chicken, or even quail or pheasant just doesn't cut it."
1,Overpriced garbage!,"This review is pertaining to the 7th edition, hardcover book. This book is printed in very small print, all in one color (blue), on very thin (cheap) paper. How the publisher justifies the ridiculous price is beyond me!If you need to buy this book for academic purposes, then at least try to find a cheaper used copy--It's not worth the money!"
4,Bread box,"Very happy with this breadbox. Item arrived in perfect condition, not a ding or dent anywhere. Love the black finish. Holds at least two loaves of bread with room. Only reason that I have given it 4 stars rather than 5 is that it is not made in the USA."
1,Bread box,"I bought this item in hopes of keeping my bread fresh, but when I received it, the box was broken and ive not been able to assemble it. I am very disappointed in this product."
2,Twice bitten,"This item was received damaged twice. I made the first return due to a crack in the black trim and several dents and scuffs on the metal. My second box arrived in two smashed boxes. The entire bottom was pushed up and there were two small dents. The storage and function were fine so I pushed out the dents and kept it as is. Distribution needs to improve before the rating can increase. Sad really, it wasn't a bad looking piece."
5,EXC. PRODUCT,"Excellant breadbox.. Just as expected. I kind of gave it a second thought after the couple of bad reviews that i read after my order, but im glad i went through with the purchase. Alot more room inside than i expected. No dings or lop-sidedness as previous reviews stated (at least not with mine). I LOVE IT! My kitchen decorations are black to go with the dark granite counter tops & it looks perfect on my countertop. Thank You! GREAT BUY & WELL WORTH THE $"
4,Good-looking bread box,"Adds a nice dash of color to the kitchen. It's made of flimsy stuff and did arrive a bit dented, but it looks good and is large enough. Good value for the price."
5,Great value,This breadbox is a very nice flat black color that goes well with my black kitchen appliances. It is spacious and well-built for the price.
1,Very flimsy!,"I purchased two of these and the metal is flimsy. Both ""boxes"" are warped and don't sit squarely on the counter (wobble). There's nothing I like about them! One was missing a plastic edge piece on the door. VERY DISAPPOINTING!"
3,Box nice but not a true red,"Box quality is good. Slide action of roll top door nice. Surprisingly roomy. BUT....this is not a true red. It is a deep salmon color. It does not match the other red counter-top appliances we have at all which are a deeper red. Next to those it looks too pink. If you don't have other red appliances, you might not notice it. I'm going to cast it back and go for black."
3,Nice Bread Box,"When I ordered this bread box, I knew from other reviews that it was not a ""true"" red, but ordered it anyway. They were right, it has a slightly pinkish cast but we are enjoying it anyway. It will fit two loaves of bread and you can squeeze a little something else inside, but it is not as big as it looks."
1,"DON""T BUY!!","Trash!!! Was so cheaply made it was broke by the time I recieved it!! It was rather big too, which would have been ok if it wasn't so cheap. It is not patent (shiny black). Which I thought it was going to be. It's a matte black. It sounds & feels like a tin can. HIGHLY recommemnd NOT to buy!"
2,deluxe bread box,"this item was much more flimsy then i thought it would be. the 2 plastic pieces on the door came broken. also the right side, (under the rubber coverings), were bent in 3 spots. i sent this back and am going to look for a sturdy wood bread box"
2,"Very bendable, not sturdy.","The box is not sturdy..............more for show than anything. Could use more space, for two loaves and hot dog buns."
3,Serves the purpose I bought it for,"Not a bad bread box, roomy enough to store bread, bagles, etc. Lid opens and closes without a problem and mine arrived in perfect shape, not dented or else as I read in another review. If you don't want to spend a lot of money on such an item, it's perfect for you."
5,Polder Deluxe Bread Box,Love this bread box. Very well made. Has lots of room. Looks great in our kitchen.
5,Great bread box.,"The true red color and generous size of this box are perfect. The lid closes quite well, keeping breads fresh."
4,Just what I Wanted,I wanted something for bread and rolls that would sit on my kitchen counter without looking HUGE. This filled my need to keep the clutter contained.
3,mediocre quality,"It's very big and bulky and picks up smudges and finger prints very easily. It can be used to hold other things besides bread, such as cookies and other baked products. It is an average item but I would not classify this as a ""deluxe bread box"" though. I purchased mine in black and was very worried when it arrived because it came in a stainless steal box, but there was a black breadbox inside."
2,BreadBox,"You get what you pay for. The look is great, but it's VERY flimsy. When you close it, you have to use both hands to open it or you end up lifting up the WHOLE breadbox with one hand as the lid sticks pretty good. It doesn't rest down flat completely either. But for the price what do you expect. It looks nice though."
2,Broken Breadbox,"I am decorating my house and was very pleased to see this bright red breadbox...it was carefully packaged and box intact. When I opened the manufacturer's box, the inside pivot point (rivet) was broken so lid did not work. Looked at breadbox more carfully and there were 2 dents in the top also.This had to have been hand-packaged (inner colored packaging) by a manufacturer's worker who did not care what they sent out. Bottom line is no Quality control. As I said before, it was very carefully packaged. Amazon is handling the return for me and I am asking for a refund instead of replacement because of the poor quality, otherwise I loved the color and design."
4,Deluxe steel bread box,I like this bread box because it matches my kitchen appliances. I also like that it is simple and blends in perfectly.
3,Steel bread box,It arrived with scratches and dents. It looks kinda cheap. The good thing on the box is that it's pretty big.
5,Looks & functions great,"This is exactly what we were looking for. Looks great on the counter. Functions great. Looks more expensive than it is, I think. Keeps our counters looking more neat and organized. Very pleased."
5,great product,The breadbox is great. It is everything I was looking for. The color is vibrant and it is a good quality item. I am very satisfied
4,Nice,"Nice breadbox, not heavy-duty, but does the job. Color is not a bright red, but a little lighter red. Lid slides nicely, roomy enough inside to hold several bread items (loaf of bread, hot dog buns). If you aren't looking for something Williams-Sonoma-ish, then this will do fine."
1,subverts the whole basis for use of CSS,"CSS is intended to be a standard way to separate layout issues from content. A well-designed web site using CSS will look the same on any standard-conforming browser.Despite this, the author actually urges readers to design solely for Microsoft Internet Explorer (see pp. 19-20). For this reason, I urge people to avoid this book."
2,Poor introduction to CSS,"As other reviewers have already pointed out, the author recommends ignoring non-IE browsers, which is patently ridiculous in 2005.I was particularly amazed at how he mocks the W3C's validator for being to strict when it disqualifies his code. Satisfying the validator isn't difficult, and if you think it is you probably shouldn't write books on web design.Dummies should look elsewhere."
1,TERRIBLE,this book is useless for anyone that doesn't stick to the very narrow parameters the author dictates. I tried some of the exercises and they did not work at all
4,Good CSS Intorduction,"Unlike James Jones and Gazzer, I tend to agree with Drewes. 20% of users don't use IE means that 80% of them do. Particularly amateurs in web development. I don't mean to gripe, but CSS is CSS and just because the author illustrates its usage with IE doesn't mean it is limited to IE.However, I will add that I have experienced more 'Broken Renderings', as Gazzer puts it, from Netscape and Firefox then I ever have with IE, which has helped me stick to one simple rule. Always develop for the majority (IE) and make sure things function for the rest."
5,Biblical Mathematics,"Excellent, excellent book to help understand the math of the Bible.Highly recommend this book to enhance your Bible study time"
1,Beware -- it can't tune many cable TV channels!,"I bought this product in January 2006 for a new PCI-Express bus Sony Vaio PC. Despite numerous driver updates, the card will not tune clearly any cable TV channel above 63. ATI tech support confirmed the problem, but has failed to provide drivers or an updated card that will correctly tune all the cable channels in my area's TimeWarner basic cable listing.Considering that a previous generation All-in-Wonder AGP-bus card tuned the same channels perfectly, this is clearly a card that has serious problems. Not the least of the problems is that ATI provides mediocre support, leaving me stuck with a $200 card that is unusable for its basic function: tuning TV channels.Until ATI corrects the problem, I advise: AVOID this card."
2,Not much difference between previous AIW and this one,"It added the FM function which is good but the sound is not as loud as TV received, also the range of channel is not so clear like 97.3, 97.4, 97.5 can get the same quality of sound.As for the TV part, when auto scanning the channels, it will stop scanning in half way even though the signal is strong enough from cable. You need to manually input the channel you like. But the price is fair enough for those video, audio functions."
2,All-in-What Board,"Mediocrity has a new face. Video performance is so-so. I had occasional problems with a slow refresh rate, with a very low demand for graphics, that shouldn't happen. TV reception isn't even on the map for 1 star quality. It looked like a Denver snowstorm. When I contacted ATI, they suggested a booster, which I purchased; $30 down the tube. To add insult to injury, I tried to use it in a new system and got a video error. Don't waste your money."
3,Not bad but not good,"This game was not bad for the price I paid. Paid only $20 brand new. This game is actually fun. You get to use any of the 4 players. It's kinda like the movie but not exactly. The story is there, but you don't play the game like how the movie is."
2,"Bad graphics, boring","Game graphics aren't very realistic/interactive. It almost looks unfinished at times, like they were rushing to get it out the door same day as the movie. Gets boring pretty quick."
3,PARA REIRSE DE LA VIDA,"ESTE ALBUM ES UNA CREACION LATINA DE UN ALTO SENTIDO DEL HUMOR. A PESAR DE QUE EL CONTENIDO EN SI NO ES NI SE CLASIFICA EN UN GRUPO DETERMINADO DE MUSICA, ES UNA BUENA ALTERNATIVA PARA BAILAR Y GOZAR!!! CHRISTIAN LIMA"
1,what a (...)!,"It will freeze every now and then when you try to save the game. The manual does not address this, and the customer service is non existent."
4,Okay,"This game has good and bad points, somethings are hard to understand and many tricks are hard to land. Which is okay but this game is for people who absolutley love BMXing."
5,a really cool game!,This game is really fun. I just love the 3d graphics and good sound. I say good sound because the sound is kind of statiky. Anyways it is a cool bmx game and i would choose it over Mat Hoffman because it is way better. I think it is worth getting if you are planing on getting a GBA game(...).
5,"Culturally relevant, well written",Only halfway through and already fully satisfiedAddresses challenging issues in a thoughtful and effective mannerExcellent treatment of cultural relevance
5,A Friendly Read,"If you're looking for deep insights into Merton, you probably want to go to some other source. This is designed to give the reader a single nugget from Merton himself, no more than a page in length, to chew on for the day. Some are more nutritious than others. Some more easily digested. I happen to appreciate wisdom in small doses, and being offered them a day at a time suits me very well. Merton the mystic, poet, theologian, monk, is endlessly interesting, enlightening, companionable. But for me, most satisfying of all are the glimpses he gives of himself as a very real human being. This book is like a good friend: always comfortable, always capable of giving surprise. I give it five stars."
5,Insights into the heart and daily life of Thomas Merton,"These daily meditations are wonderful insights into the contemplative heart of Thomas Merton, and short enough to be read even when a person doesn't have a lot of time. This is a book that I will use as an inspirational resource repeatedly, rather than just a book that is read through once and set aside. It you are familiar with, and have a kindred heart with Thomas Merton, I believe you will like this book very much. His contemplative insights have helped me tremendously in slowing down and taking note of the gifts of creation that surround us .. and of which we are an integral part."
5,One year with Merton. A life of contemplation.,"Rather than write my own words. I'll offer a selection from this amazing collection. This is from his journal on September 7, 1958.""This beautiful day, with the quiet sun shining on the bronze paint of the Garden Virgin and on the marigolds and the weeds and the hills. Crickets everywhere. Nothing moving in the garden but the wind, a butterfly, and my pen.""Fair day of recollection in the new novitiate chapel, and I was happy in it and accepted its imperfections, and accepted everything. That is all that is needed. When you accept what you have, you see all you have received is more than enough and you are overwhelmed. I desire other things because I fear to be content with what I have-I fear it is inglorious. In the last few days I have seen what matters is to be humble enough to admit I am content with just this. Leave the rest to God.""Enjoy."
4,Nice book to have in my library,I like this book has a lot of information about using food for all sorts of health benefits and help with certain ailments as well.
3,Sunpass holder OK,not the best design but OK Suction cups do not hold the transponder does not sit as flat as it should against the widow
4,Toll Pass Holder,Es excelente. Lo que estaba buscando. Mi sunpass es del modelo antiguo y este es genial para remplazar las tiras adhesivas.
2,Fine for a few months.,"Doesn't seem to last long in the Florida sun. Over the course of a summer, the plastic will warp and crack. It doesn't adhere that great to the windshield anyway, due to the small suction cups, but once it warps, you can't get both cups to contact the glass and the whole thing is basically useless.I emailed the company once after hearing they actually had a warranty (I was on my second clip) but never heard back.A section of non-adhesive electrical tape (the rubber kind) for about $2, wrapped around my epass's outer edge, seems to do a decent job of keeping it from sliding around on the dash. Since I have no intention of paying for another of these things, and don't want to go back to velcro, that's good enough for me."
4,A handy gadget for your sunpass,"This holder is well made but I would have preferred 3 rather than 2 suction cups. Newer sunpass models come equipped with 3 suction cups. However, it seems to hold my model onto the windshield very well so I can't complain."
3,T-Klip Toll Pass Holder,What I have received it's actually something that look like half or three quarters of what this picture is showing. Not what I thought this item was about.[...]
2,T-Klip Toll Pass Holder,"The ordering experience was good. It was easy to order. The product arrived promptly. Unfortunately, the new Virginia E-ZPass is thicker than 3/4"". The actual thickness is around 7/8"". So I cannot fit it into the T-Klip Toll Pass Holder. Since it's less than $7, I am not sure it's worth the trouble of sending it back. Currently, I am still looking for a toll pass holder of the right size for my E-ZPass."
2,Broken,"I had it for about a year. Yes it falls down a lot (They all do), but I had to stick it back on so many times that the plastic actually snapped in half where one of the suction cups was held."
5,"""like you were at the track and knew the guys""","to any true race fan,once you pick this book up you won't want to stop reading!you start to feel like you know the guys on tour as your reading this.you also see what goes on during the week when the cameras arent on.if you love winston cup you'll love this book"
3,"Incorrect, but interesting","This book is filled with minor errors (such as the misuse of certain racing terms) that shows Mr Assael is an author, not a fan. Although this book is a good read (especially for new fans), I'd save it for after I had finished either of Peter Golenback's books."
4,Fun book,"This is my first Xanth novel - and it was quite fun. I have been a big fan of Piers and know him though the Humanist association I used to work for, but I just hadn't gotten around to reading any of his Xanth stuff yet. Boy, was I missing out. If the rest of them are like this, then they are highly enjoyable."
5,Another great book from Piers Anthony,"Pet Peeve is another great book that I just couldn't put down. Every time another Xanth novel is released, I know I can expect a great read, and this one matches up to any of the other Xanth books."
4,Great CD!!!,Jimmy is an awesome guitar player and this is an incredible live CD of great electric blues with versions of a couple of Hendrix songs...highly recommended!
4,NOT HIS BEST,"After the brilliant GUITAR cd I expected more of the same. However on this one he sings, and that is a bummer. THACKERY is one of the best blues ( or anything ) guitarists today. He has total control over his instrument and uses it to sing eloquently.However when he sings, the whole sound is reduced to average blues. His voice is like a mix of ROY BUCHANAN and a wheezy PETER GREEN. Not very attractive. The material is OK but after the exceptional GUITAR cd doesn't reach nearly the same hight.It is still a very good blues CD, mainly due to the awesome guitar work. But from a virtuoso like THACKERY this is a bit dissapointing. But even an average THACKERY cd is still at least 4 stars and better than most other guitar orientated blues."
2,Disappointment,"Jimmy's got lightning fast fingers and can play the crap out of the guitar. The show spotlights Jimmy's guitar playing and that's about where the fun ends.True, Jimmy's a hell of a player but his approach showcases a diappointing trend among many great blues players - the tendency to view their rhythm sections as mere vehicles for soloing while missing the whole concept of group interaction. Blues has the potential to be the best music in the world when the entire group falls into a pocket, but these guys just aren't locked.I had heard great things about this album - defintely some killer guitar licks, but overall I was very disappointed. In order to be inspired by a blues album, I have to hear a rhythm section that isn't afraid to step up to the plate, connect with the guitarist and establish a groove. Jimmy's songwriting is less than inspired, and the rhythm section doesn't do justice to the covers. Jimmy would do himself a favor to get with some better players."
5,Spirit to Heal - Spirituality's Profound Influence,"This awesome book related to me so much of the journey of cancer which my husband and I experienced. I am so grateful to Dr. Torosian and Dr. Biddle for bringing their experiences through research and practice and making known the profound effect of spirituality. My husband who had lung cancer and I both shared a deep faith in God. Shortly after his death, I attended their seminar on 'Spirit to Heal' and purchased the book. It was so amazing to read what we had gone through and understand the multi-dimensions of the spiritual process. 'Spirit to Heal' is a gift of love to all who know suffering and want to rise above their pain and meet God, Face to face."
4,Pancake heaven,"I was a little worried that this spatula would be too thick for pancakes or crepes, but with the tapered edge, it picks such things up with no problem. Like any silicone tool, it's easy to clean and won't melt or start to shred from heat. This spatula is oversize, with a large handle - great for maneuvering big things like pancakes, but not ideal for close quarters in a small pan."
3,A little awkward,"I was really excited to purchase this product as it is a hard item to find. It really is heat proof and cleans well. The drawback I've found is that it is a little thick and this makes it awkward to get under thin and delicate items such as crepes. It's wonderful, however for anything heavier like hamburgers."
5,CyberPunk: Dark Future fun gaming,"Fans of Neuromancer, Burning Chrome, and Virtual light, will love this RPG fast and gripping live the future with body augmentations, and brutal weapons. a perfect 10"
5,.........wow........,"Alright, so my friend calls me up, saying ""Chris is back from college and he broght some scary rpg with him, wanna come over?"" so i decided why not. Now mind you, my friends are rather experienced when it comes to rpg's, and i had never played one before, not even D&D....wow....I never knew such wonderful things were possible! Hitting your friends with paintbombs, installing novelty items into your body, blowing off your enemies appendages with assault rifles!!It was easy enough for me to understand with some help, but so detailed! now i must buy this for myself!!!"
2,like watching a neighbor's home video,"just imagine one of your neighbors wins a trip to austria and a new video camera...you unfortunately have to later sit through the result...this is such a huge disappointment...of course, the music is beautiful, and the sound is superb, but the camerawork is vapid and unrelated to the theme...long, boring focus on not particularly interesting architecture---there are lengthy shots of a monastery in the tyrol that is far overdone, full of inane shots of damaged ornamentation and not particularly interesting courtyard views...later the scene jumps to innsbruck, but, again, unbearably long focuses on one or two buildings...and somehow they were able to do all the filming at a time when no one was moving in the streets...all in all this is terrible, and a terrific waste of money...it would have been immeasurably more interesting simply watching the orchestra perform..."
4,A good family game.,"Okay, there are plenty of games that are more exciting out there, but this is a really nice family game to have. It is good, clean, and fun. The graphics are good (but not great) and the physics are for the most part realistic and believable. The controls are easy to pick up and the tricks are fairly easy to complete. Splashdown contains a good mix of upbeat music and the gameplay should keep you occupied for a decent amount of time. Just remember, although the game is fun, don't expect a heart-pounding, adrenaline-producing experience."
2,Not as good as the other playstation game,This is ok for graphics.. the learning of the control is not easy and it was a un-realistic ride. I ski often and just did not feel comfortable. I bought the other Playstation jet ski game and loved it!!!
3,A good game,"My advise: Don't buy this game, just rent it! This is a perfect game for a week-end, after a few days you get bored of it. The graphics are O.K and also the play, but is too short. The difficult level is, well, difficult and you are going to lose your patience very fast."
5,love this game,great game. it is extremely realistic. graphics are very good.splashdown is a must have game. really worth your money.the multiplayer mode is very cool. buy it now!
4,Almost Perfect,"Realistic water actionEach watercraft has distinctive features and handlingDynamic wakes, rolling waves, and turbulence18 awesome locationsAll of that stuff above makes this rock.All of that stuff below makes this game not rock.Only 2 people in multiplayerLess then 10 vehiclesSo as a whole it has stuff that makes this rock and stuff that makes it not rock. But this game deserves 4 stars and gets 4 stars. Buy this if you like any other water games or you like anything that has to do with water."
1,THIS GAME [sinks],"This game doesn't even deserve a star, it is a horrible game, there is no announcer which makes the game very dull just listening to music that is broken down into pieces, the blink 182 song on there ""rock show"" is edited, it cuts out about 1 minute of the song, probly more. The graphics are good and all, but they just needed to learn how to work with the game, and make it exciting, it is just very dull after 3 races of just listening to the same music over and over again, and no exciting announcer, like on SSX, or SSX Tricky"
4,Great,"This item works great for a sinus headache. I would buy this if you have a lot of head aches because it really does work.Bastrop, Texas"
4,Sinucleanse Nasal Wash - Plastic Neti Pot,It's a really good product. It helps me with my breathing. I both like the SinuCleanse Neti Pot and the SinuCleanse Squeeze. I use it every morning and after get back from school.
5,Sinsus Nasal Wash Neti Pot,"If you have sinsus problems, you may want to try this nasal wash system. It comes with salt packets and Neti pot. I use this when my sinsus are really clotted and have sinsus headaches. I received this packet in good condition and have not had any problems with this product. Plus, the cost (even with S/H) was less than I could find at any local store. I would recommend this product to others.SinuCleanse Nasal Wash System, Plastic Neti Pot With Salt Packets"
1,Beware!,"I felt I had to put a warning out there after the experience I had. Always loved the netti pot, used it several times over the years for cold related sinus congestion.But two weeks ago after suffering a very bad cold, I used the netti pot, and immediately felt ear pain and fullness, it progresses to the worst ear infection I have ever had. My ear has been clogged up with fluid for over 2 weeks.I went to an ENT who said I probably forced fluid into my middle ear using the netti pot due to the fact my sinuses were already inflamed, no I'm on antibiotics , just hoping my hearing will come back.So be careful using this product, if you use the wrong angle or have a very bad cold you could end up like me!"
4,Breathing Better,The products works well. I bought this product based on a doctor recommendation to help me reduce allergies. It takes a little to get used to but once it do it several times it gets easier. A good deal for the price.
4,Really works,"I have always had horrible allergies and bad sinus infections as a result. Last year alone, I was on antibiotics about 5 times in one semester for sinus infections. My mom saw this and tried it and told me about it. I was a little skeptical at first, but after using it for awhile, it really does work.It took me a long time to get it to work just right. Which led me to realize that you really do need to read the directions and follow them, because once I did follow the directions, it worked well. I've seen that some people complain that post nasal drip gets worse after using it, and I have found that mine gets worse after doing it, but after about an hour, it dries up completely for the day, which is a miracle in my book. But it's really fn to see all that comes out of your nose and be able to breathe afterwards. It really is great."
2,"The method earns all the stars, not the item...","All the wonderful reviews here should be attributed to the method, and I agree with them 100%. But what should be discussed here is the actual item, and it's just an overpriced piece of junk. I had previously a ceramic pot I bought at Wholefoods. When I opened the SinuCleanse package I got at CVS, my jaw dropped. A thin piece of cheap plastic and a bunch of salt packets for the same price you can get the real thing? I am glad I saved the receipt....This junk goes back to CVS, and I go back to the wholefoods supermarket...If you are looking for a neti pot at Amazon.com, look for a ceramic pot. It costs the same and it does make a difference."
2,Get NeilMed NasaFlo Daily Nasal Hygiene System instead,"I had great difficulty in using the SinuCleanse product and found the NeilMed NasaFlo Daily Nasal Hygiene to be vastly superior.The Neti pot that comes with the SinuCleanse has a very narrow spigot and it doesn't make a good seal with my nostril. As a result, I good deal of the solution frequently leaked out before going into my nose. I tried everything to fix it, including using vaseline on the tip.In contrast, the spigot on the Neti pot with the NeilMed system has a tapered end and it fits perfectly and snugly to my nostril, and their is no spillage whatsoever. I highly reccomend the NeilMed as an alternative to the SinuCleanse system."
5,Why didn't I buy this sooner????,"I previously read about neti pots but was too afraid to give it a try. Last week I was suffering from major nasal congestion and was willing to do anything for relief. Instead of ordering a neti pot over the internet and waiting days for it to arrive, I went to my local drugstore to get the Sinuscleanse system. While it was a bit weird for me, I wish I would have discovered this system a long time ago. I had immediate relief from my nasal congestion and called everyone I knew to tell them about my new discovery."
3,Wish it had a lid,"I wish this Neti Pot had a lid so that when I swirl the water and the salt around it wouldn't splash up and out of the pot. The spout was also slightly wider than I would have liked, but it's probably great for someone with bigger nostrils. Other than that, I like its compact size and how lightweight it is which makes it easy to travel with."
2,Weird plastic smell,"This would be better if i wasn't inhaling what smelled to me like burnt plastic. After every use i get this smell stuck in my nose for hours even if i have washed the pot numerous times. It worries me that maybe there is some chemical getting stuck inside my nose. I don't know much about different kinds of plastics, but i know my sister have a different one that does not transfer this plastic smell(it's a SinuCleanse brand too)... I noticed because i ""borrowed"" and tried hers :)."
4,Alternative product,I highly recommend rinsing your sinuses. NeilMed makes another device called Sinus Rinse which is like a squirt bottle that just squirts the solution into your nasal cavity (rather than flow in by gravity as in the Netipot). The company will supply sample kits to physicians. As a doctor I have handed out many such samples. You may wish to ask your doctor about it and have him/her provide you with the sample so you can try without risk.
2,After all the positive reviews... I guess I was hoping for more...,"I generally find myself all congested up before going to sleep. I try to not use things that will give me rebound congestion. I've tried it a few times so far, but it seems to only help me for 15-20 minutes at a time.I have no interest in repeatedly flushing saline through my nose all day to continue the bennefit.Based on all the positive feedback on the product it must work for some folks.I'm sure I'll try it again when hayfever season comes back, or if I get a sinus infection."
5,A must for every household,Works as advertised. The saline solution wasn't harsh at all. I do this in the shower whenever I get a chance. My sinuses feel cleaner and relieved after using this. It could be all in my head though.
3,works as advertised,"but it's plastic. Somehow i wish i had chosen a ceramic one.By the way, the neti pot is not as distressing as a friend of mine has described. Very quick to get used to it. But then, while it indeed helps, it is not as miraculous as i expected to be -- it doesn't get my nasal system totally open by using it, but it improves enough that it's worth using it."
3,I saw it on Oprah with Dr Oz,"I guess I am not doing it right, because it's not working for me like I saw on the Oprah show. The product is exactly as expected, though, and the saline packets are very convenient. I think I am having a problem with ""operator error""."
2,Squeeze bottle type is better,This teapot style is the original and is outdated. The squeeze bottle works easier and much better to get through a stuffy sinus cavity. The pot works on gravity alone and cannot push through the slightest resistance.
2,Pain!,"The first time I used this was at night, right before bed. Big mistake! When I woke up the next morning, my inner ear felt really painful, and blowing my nose magnified the pain.Afterwards, I decided to only use it in the daytime. However, I still get small painful sensations in my ears as soon as I blow my nose right after using the neti pot. I hear really loud ""scratching"" noises deep in my head as I blow my nose, and it takes about thirty minutes for the pain and sounds to go away.The packaging says that if your Eustachian tubes are larger than normal, you should cease use of the neti pot. I guess the SinuCleanse Nasal Wash system isn't for me!"
1,Top Cover Falls Into Pot,"Unfortunately, the top cover falls into pot. Don't know if this is intrinsic to product as a whole or of the individual pot that I received."
2,Neti Pots are Great - THIS ONE ISN'T,"Neti Pots are amazing - I was a total non-believer, but it really works. This particular one is very cheaply made and has a very large spout for the nostril. You don't need pre-made solution either - just use table salt and warm water. Buy another one!"
3,Some Improvement but no Miracles,This helped my sinuses some but I didn't see any miraculous improvement. The product works for what it does but I had hoped for more.I used it for about three weeks every day. Maybe you need to do it longer.
5,NASAL DOUCHE.........AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!,This was on Oprah's show with DR OZ. It has changed my life.I Highly recommend this product
5,Netipots are an excellent way to irrigate your sinuses,"My name is Jordan S. Josephson, M.D. F.A.C.S. and I am the author of the book Sinus Relief Now recently published by Penguin Books. The book is about sinus problems, allergy, asthma, snoring sleep apnea and gastro-esophageal reflux (GERD). I am a total believer in patients irrigating their sinuses on a daily basis. Irrigation removes infection, allergens and irritants. I personally suffer from sinus problems and irrigate myself. I recommend irrigation to all of my patients. Netipots are a very effective way to clean out your nose and sinuses. This is an excellent product. I recommend and show you how to use netipots in my book Sinus Relief Now."
1,Horrible headaches after using,"After the first use, I felt fine. But later I got a really bad sinus headache that won't go away even with lots of advil. I tried the nettie pot again the next day and still got a horrible sinus headache. I would be careful before trying this, as it must not be for everyone."
5,Old Remedy That Still Works!,"I have never heard of a Neti Pot before the Oprah show. I was horribly congested and bought one. I now use it all the time, especially with my allergies. With the salt mixture, it really helps clear out your nasal passages immediately. I had to use it a few times a day when I was really congested, but it beats the soreness of a constant handkerchief. This is an old time remedy that has, fortunately, been made popular again. This set includes the salt mixture."
5,Sinuses,Have used this product for about two months now and am very well pleased with the results and NO adverse side-effects just positive results. It works as Dr. Oz described it would work.
2,Small & cheap plasric,"I just received this, I bought it as a gift and am dissapointed! It's small & cheap plastic! For the price, you can get one at Target that's bigger and easier to use!"
3,SinuCleanse Neti Pot Not for everyone,"This product is not for everyone. Every time I use it, I feel all clogged up."
1,Bad design,I bought this with great expectations. I thought it was a great way to travel. I tried it at home first and it was awful compared to the one I use every day. It took forever for the pot to empty compared to the one I use everyday. Also it didn't have to flow that mine does. To use the full pot takes at least 10 times longer then mine.The little packets of salt burned my nose even when I cut the directed amount in half.This is not a good design. I'm sorry I bought it
1,Doesn't work for me,"I deal with some seriously congested sinuses at times so I tried this based on seeing it reviewed on Dr. Oz. Just doesn't work for me or offer any relief from my congestion. Maybe I'm an exception I don't know, but I really wanted this to work."
3,at least worth a try!,"I bought this for my boyfriend because he always seemed to have a stuffy nose. I have no idea why, but he couldn't seem to get it to work. This might be a personal problem (Haha), but he was doing it right and everything! His nose might have been a little TOO stuffy.I don't get pressure in my sinuses and I only have seasonal stuffiness, but I wanted to try this because it looked interesting! It worked for me, but this is how it felt: If you've ever accidentally sucked water up your nose when you're underwater and you get that instant sinus headache in between your eyes, you've used a ""neti pot.""Definitely worth a try though: I've heard amazing things from a lot of people who now use it RELIGIOUSLY. (as long as you can get over that terrible drowning feeling!)"
4,Help me with my sinus infection,I got a bad sinus cold this weekend and was miserable from it. I had read about using Neti Pots for sinus irrigation but couldn't wait the time to get it by ordering online. I got it at Walgreen's.It does work. It has given me relief from my cold. My head felt very stuffed up this morning and the sudafed I was taking had no affect. I've done two irrigations and feel much better. It will become part of my daily routine.
3,Sinus Cleanse,"My sinus has never been better since I began using the Neti Pot. However had I looked locally I would have been able to purchase a better pot at a lower price. (And saved on the shipping:) I have been recommending them to all my friends that have problems with allegories etc. But go to Longs or Wallgreens as they have a blue one with a better nozzle and a lid, for less than the combined price with shipping and it comes with 50 salt packets instead of 30. :)"
5,Neti Nut,"I started reading about the use of Neti pot's for sinus problems after a life long problem in this area and decided to try one. I have to admit the first time I used it it did feel strange but more or less like you feel when you go swim and get water up your nose! Now..I wouldn't go a day without using it. I have not had any sinus infections in over a year! When I go into a meeting at work (I work from home)I come home and do the Neti pot and I feel like I am washing those germs right down the drain. Think of it as a washing of your nose, a bathing like you do a shower or a hand wash and it makes sense.The first time you use it you will be amazed about 2-3 hours later when you bend over to pick something up the salt water drips out! It's been in there all that time starting to heal up all that irritation. It is a great item!"
5,It works!!!,"After seeing it on Oprah, I thought it was worth a shot. At first I felt silly trying to figure out how to use this contraption. But even after the first try, I felt very clear. I suffer from constant allergies and sinus infections, so anything to avoid them works for me. Anyhow, from my experience it really works. It clears out my nostrils and I breathe so much easier. I highly recommend this product to anyone that wants to breathe a little better :o)"
1,Probably gave me a sinus infection,"After purchasing this Neti Pot, I used it, and later that day a friend asked ""You didn't use tap water, did you?"" The directions specify to use lukewarm tap water, but my friend claims this can be very dangerous and make you really sick. The next day, when blowing my nose, my mucus had a significant amount of blood in it, followed the next day by a very painful sinus infection that has so far lasted a week. Of course, I can't guarantee that this product caused it, but I won't be using it again without distilled water. Here's a NPR article describing how dangerous this can be:[...]"
2,What I wanted was a high grade neti pot but what I got was this plastic low grade thing,What I thought I was getting was A high grade(sorta like ceramic)potbut what I got was this piece of low grade plastic.What a disappointment!
1,"Developed by Dr. Diane Heatley??? Yea, Right!","""..Developed by Dr. Diane Heatley, a leading Ear, Nose, and Throat Physician....""This is completely bogus statement. I don't want to support product/people that make such false claims.The origins of nasal irrigation are understood to be in the ancient Hindu practice of Ayurveda whose roots are traced to the Vedas. Maybe Dr. Diane is that old?When I saw this (her) claim, I laughed and placed order from himalayaninstitute.org - They are making original Neti Pot since 1972."
3,it works,I personally like the squeeze bottles better. I find it easier and cleaner to use. If you are really stuffed up you can put a LITTLE presure behind it which you can't do with the Neti Pot. But this works as expected and the salt packets are a prefect concentration.
5,Excellent cleaner,"I only wish I knew about this before! It takes a little to get use to, but my nose loves me for it!!"
5,AMAZING!!! Wish I had known about this years ago.,"I have suffered from nasal congestion, nosebleeds and sinus problems for years. It has been at least 10 years since I awoke without blood in my nose. After using my Neti pot the first time, my nostrils were open and stayed open. I have been using it daily for a week and am amazed at the difference. Spent hours at the park the other day, came home and used the Neti pot, and NO allergies!! Unheard of for me. I walked through the produce section at the market yesterday and was surprised to actually *smell* the produce! I just ordered one for my husband. This is the best thing I have found out about in a long time!!"
4,Relief at last!,"This product definitely makes your breathing excellent. But during the wintertime it may be better to not use this.I received mine during the winter and although I felt great after using it, I found that my nasal passages were very dry the morning after and hurt. This might be due to the salt that could be left in your nasal passages since you never flush with water afterward.First time using this it felt as if I was drowning, I guess something in your nose signals that ""drowning"" message to be sent to your brain so it takes some getting used to. When blowing your nose you must also be very gentle as hard blows will tinker with your ears and make them uncomfortable.Overall provides great immediate relief BUT temporary and takes 5-10 minutes. Nonetheless it did what it stated it would and did it very well... too bad the effects don't last forever..."
5,Relief at last!,"I bought one of these for myself and two for my children. We are all hooked on this wonderful invention. Living in the South, we normally have constant sinus problems. By using this every morning, we have virtually eliminated all of our problems."
4,salty,"This product works great. The only problem I've had is it seems like the salt mixture never fully dissolves, so you get a blast of stinging salt at the end. Now I just use half a packet of salt and I haven't had a problem. My nasals feel free and clean for once!"
4,works great,"works great, hard to get used to at first, but after the first few times i got the hang of it. it came in less than a week and was in the condition that it was listed as"
4,Sinuses all nice and clean - I can breathe!,I heard about Neti Pots from watching Dr. Oz on Oprah. Couldn't find the product in town so I found it at Amazon.com for about the same price. Very easy and got it in less than a week. The product itself is ok. Functional. Very cheap plastic with absolutely no color or style but it works and that is what counts. Overall I think the product is definitely overpriced - seems like it probably cost pennies to make.
5,Effective & Easy to Maintain,"It's not fancy, but it does its job. The beauty of this neti pot over some of the seemingly fancier ones is that its dishwasher safe & certainly isn't going to break if you drop it. This isn't the kind of item one wants on display anyway; so the price coupled with its easy maintenance & light weight make it a very efficient product."
3,"Works OK, but not a miracle cure","Having suffered from sinus problems for years, I was excited when I heard about the product and bought it right away. While it does help in feeling more ""cleared out"", I have not seen a reduction in sinus headaches. Still, it isn't very expensive and I did note a slight improvement, so I do not regret the purchase."
1,It's Plastic ?,Grade F for being plastic and not enough details to determine the material from which the neti pot is made.
4,"Works well, but is long term expenditure.","This device works great. It cleans out my sinuses really well. Don't know if it is a coincidence, but I have had no seasonal sneezing, runny nose or watery eyes since I started using this item three weeks ago.The pre-mixed packets of powder that must be used will be an expensive longterm proposition. I tried salt as suggested in other reviews, and found it didn't work as well.If you buy one you may find it leaks around the knozzle from the nostril you insert it in. I have cured this by rolling a rubber band several times around the knozzle. It seals the nostril/knozzle joint."
3,Thought results would come sooner-over-rated,"I have been using this product on a daily basis for a few weeks now and have not noticed much of a difference with my sinuses. In fact, sometimes i think that it makes me even more stuffy right after using it. Hopefully better results are yet to come. Over-rated."
3,"it works as intended, but no help with symptoms","The pot works because it does not allow to much pressure with water entering the nose, which is plus, but as with other such devices there is no help for me in decreasing allergies and sinus problems, just less problems with water going into the ears. The negative is the pot had sharp edges, which I had to remove manually with a knife for safety. I think there is more hype than substance with it. and success with others nothing more than placebo effect."
1,does not work for me,"i've tried this several times, and failed. i've read the instructions over and over, and nothing seems to work. i thought maybe i just have a 'different nose' so i let my sister try and she too couldnt get the water to come out. after she was done with the few drips coming out, (same result i had) her nose was stuffy for the next few days. the spout is small and i cant get a good enough seal on it. i dont know if the original neti pots are larger, but this one just doesnt seem to work at all for me"
3,could use some design improvement,"This product's spout is too large for my nostrils. When I tilt my head, half goes in my nose and half just runs down my face. I do think it helps clear your sinuses but I still need my Zyrtec for pet allergies. If they redesigned the product to have a smaller opening, then I would have given it 4.5 stars."
2,Didn't really make me feel better,"I've used it every day for over a month, and in all honesty, I didn't find much of an improvement in my sinusitis. Let's say the improvement was 15%. Is it really worth the time and the discomfort?"
5,LOVE,This lunch box is the perfect size for a preschooler.My 3 year old uses his for his lunch and loves it.
1,Worst CD ever,"Quite simply, this is the worst episode i have ever bought. However Since it says Nirvana on it, it gets a special place on my bedroom floor."
1,"About the ""man who sold the world""","I just wanted to say that ""The Man Who Sold The World"" IS a David Bowie song! Check the release dates. I hope that the person who thinks that Kurt Cobain wrote this song checks their facts."
1,Terrible,"Luckily I didnt purchase this album, a friend lent it to me. I must say just listening to this is terrible never mind the fact that the songs that have been totally ruined here are some of the best written songs. This entire album is produced so badly. If I was the producer I wouldnt like my name on the back of it. It sounds as though the 'grunge' sound has tried to be replecated by using computers. It sounds just so bad. Some bands can pull off covers excedingly well, unfortunately for these bands they cannot. Do not buy this album, it is terrible."
2,hello hello hello hell no!,"Do not buy this album. It blows, nuff said. However I did like this songs by that Beki Bondage. It's strange but she sounds a tad like Kurt, but that's not enough to save this album. The songs really are quite bad."
1,WHOAAAAAAAA NOOOOOOOOOO,"WOW this is prolly one of the worst things I've ever heard...I know they are paying ""tribute"" to nirvana but please do it at least half way decent."
1,Smells like ....,There needs to be less than 1 star in these ratings. This album would get a -10. Listen to the previews. The bands suck. They sing like they don't even care - like they're 2nd rate cover bands at a lousy junior high's spring formal. This albums smells alright.
1,thppt! aack! ooogh! smells like regurgitation!,"i've never heard of this album until 2 weeks ago and i have loved nirvana for years. i really cant stand wierd al and frankly, i think he should have shot his head off, and died emptying his bowels instead of kurt. maybe this verbal diahreah could have been avoided if kurt shot himself a day sooner. (bieng that al got the legal permission to cut this !@#$%^&@!%$@%$#%$#^%^%^$^&^&#%!^%$&@$&!#ing!#@#% less than 8 hours before his death. i think.)in short, buy a Dr. Demento record if you want more origional humorous recording.LONG LIVE NIRVANA!!!"
5,Just the right size for under the sink.,"This is an older model, I think. I can't find it in stores and sadly, I don't think they make it anymore.. I was thrilled to find it on Amazon to replace the exact same model I bought a long time ago. It is the perfect size. Nothing made today fits under the sink except really small ones. RUBBERMAID, THIS IS THE PERFECT SIZE. You should make these again."
4,Immigration and Loss of Identity,"In Things Fall Apart Chinua Achebe narrates the disruptive effect European colonisation has on old tribal ways of life. In George Lamming's The Emigrants (1954)the movement is the other way round: a group of West Indians immigrates to London in search of a better future. During the voyage on the ship, told as a kind of rite of passage from their old to the new world, they share past experiences, dreams, hopes and ambitions. The voyage however doesn't prepare them for the life of outcasts that awaits them in London, and the subsequent loss of identity. The form of the narrative adjusts itself to its theme: its continuous flow, which narrates the voyage, breaks up into several trails following the individual destinies that lose themselves in the smoke of London. Though not as great as In The Castle of my Skin, which I think Mr. Lamming's greatest novel, it is an intense book about immigration, cultural chock and loss of identity."
1,I wouldn't recommend it,"I had to read this book for an English class and I did not enjoy it at all. Plot is hard to follow, characters are unlikeable, and the writing style comes across as confused and unpolished. I wouldn't recommend it."
1,boring,Unless you collect J.L.L merchandise pass on this.This has alot of dvd's but it's all just interviews.The 4 concert songs are awful and notworth wathing once.I was really dissapointed with this collection.I don't believe anyone wants to set around and listen to 4 plus hours of interviews inwhich they say the same thing over and over and over.
2,BIG Yu-Gi-Oh FAN! Who Hates This Game!!!,Ive got 2 words for it: IT STINKS!!!. My Friends told me Its a good game cuz it brings 3 cards and its just like in The Show. But ITS NOT!!!. I Bought a Japanese YU-GI-Oh Duel Monsters 6 for The GBA And now Thats a GAME!!! It evens makes you think like a duelist. I beat Duel Stories in 1 week That sunday I returned it. THE GAME SUCKS!!!
2,Not the real thing,"Ive been dueling since the cards first came out and let me tell you this game is nothing like the real cards.Even the cards that it cimes with are not all that good.Even my worst cards are better then'em.I bought the game the day it came out and was lucky enough to get my last card that i realy needed,Exodia.NOw that i have every piece of Exodia i can get rid of the game.Gettin Exodia was the only good thing about this game."
1,Yu_Gi_Oh!,"I bought this game about 2 weeks ago. I wanted the playstation version, but I bought this one mainly because it came with 3 cards. I figured I'd get this so I could brush up on my dueling skills. I returned the game 1 week later. Why? It's just not fun, I was very dissapointed. it pales in comparisson to the extremly fun real card game. The only reason I gave it 1 star is because it has this really cool feature: wonder what that 8-didgit # at the bottom of the card is? just type it on to the password screen and Viola' youve got the card in the game ( 'cept you can't use alot of 'em until your ""levle"" is higher ). My advice, stick with the real game."
4,Dark Duels Stories,I thought this game was great. Before i got this game i had no idea how to play by the rules. This game taught me very quickly. I also enjoyed the idea of putting your own cards in the game. The only dissapointment was that you never get to fight pegasaus. Oh well its a good game.
3,Good Game,"This game is challenging at first but gets easier and gets quite boring after a few weeks. I beat all the duelist in about a week including Yami Bukura, Nitemare, Marik, and Shadi."
5,YU-Gi-OH!,this game is also going to be made for GBA later this year. this game is going to be cool. there is also a real card game. ther arent many stores that sell the cards though.
4,yu-gi-oh chalenge,"I am an above avarage duelist who got this game looking for a chalenge and I got one you will face many great duelists like joey, yugi, kaiba, and darknite. this game will help you prepare for real duels and help you stratagise"
4,This game is the best,I got this game july 8th and was hooked on it the first time I dueled.I had to look at three different game stores but finally found it at FYE.This game is so popular that it could be considered rare. I had to get my copy when the shipment first came in.I'm definitely not giving up my copy.
4,The Master Duelist,I found Yugi-oh drak duel stories a fantastic game.If you have a brother like me you sometimes don't want to play with them because they cheat and are to easy to beat. On the game the computer gets harder to beat along the way so you always have a new challange to face. It also comes with some cool cards to add to your deck. The only thing that bugs me about this game is that you have to type in the code on your cards to get them into the game. I think that's Kind of a skeem to make you buy new cards. Otherwise it's a great game! So if your a Yugi-oh fan I recommend it 100%!
5,WAY COOOOOOOL,"this game is incredible!!!i love it, with the deuling and by the way, if you watch the show youll probly do better because you know how to duel and really believe in this awesome thing they call Yu-Gi-Oh!.much like pokemon, but it has 1 thing that pokemon doesn't-fun while at the same time you use your mind and beleive in what youre doing. i would play the card game also but people think its dorky and it'll ruin your reputation-but dont get me wrong, you can play the game boy game without worrying about your popularity. i just cant explain how fun it is combining magic cards with monsters, its like it was a game ACTUALLY made for the fearows of Ancient Egypt. GET IT, SERIOUSLY IT IS THE BEST GAME EVER! BETTER THAN POKEMON, and you know how fun that was when it came out!"
4,Good or Bad,"This game is kind of cool but i've seen better. The best GBYu-Gi-Oh game is Duel Monsters 6 Expert 2 but it's in japanese.Probably the best thing about this game is the 3 cards that come with it.My guess is that the cards are the Three God Cards which have the sign NOT FOR SALE on them.These cards are called God of Ra, God of Osiris, and the God of Obelisk.These cards are only for display.Dont ask me why. The cards are only used in the show. I'm going to buy the game but only for the cards. If you want a cool game download D.M.Expert 6 or wait for Forbidden Memories 2 for the P.S.2. It already came out in Japan."
2,Up to the hype........?,"Dark Duel Stories is not an rpg game if thats what you thought, usually in rpg's you can walk around. Not in this. You sit in the main menue the whole time and just keep playing cards the whole time, not once do you leave the main menue. It is extremely repetitive and not worth 30 dollars, however if you are really into the card game and have a lot of money to waste it might be okay, however most people dont have too much money to fork over for a game that wont be too fun. I hope this review was useful."
1,Bad in todays standards,The graphics and sound are abysmal. The card pool is small. The game doesn't follow the Yu-Gi-Oh rules. The opponents are random. Get a better Yu-Gi-Oh game.
1,this (isnt good),"this game is just awful. It's nothing like the real card game and the graphics leave much to be desired. Plus the promos (arent good). If you want a good yugioh game I suggest The Eternal Duilist Soul, it has great promos and is just like the real card game."
5,yu-gi-oh dark duel stories,"This game is a conclusion to the japenese hit card game Yu-Gi-Oh! and is now in a form of a game. You may battle in-game duelers and forge your own deck. Based on the television series on Kids WB ,Yu-Gi-Oh Dark Duel Stories is a great strategie game. Watch out pok'emon t.c.g Yu-Gi-Oh is Comin to town!"
2,Yuck!,"This game stinks.It doesn't follow the real ruels of the game.There are type advanteges witch means you could beat a blue eyes with a kureboh!And they have deck capcity and stuff like that.and the graphics are horrible!The graphics for this game look like the graphics for a gameboypocket!The only thing i like about it is the title.So in simple words,Don't waste your money on this..."
5,exzodia,this game is the best game i have bought in awhile its alot better than that pokemon my deck of cards is the best i have blue eyes ultimate dragon red eyes metal dragon and exzodia nobody has beaten me yet i have already beat yami yugi 30 times. but this game has everything you would want in it and the cards you receive in the box are blue eyes white dragon black magician and the head of exzodia you fight each other cards. the only thing that suxs is that for really rare cards you have to give up 2 cards that are in play before u can use that card.
5,How Great!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This Game Is,"I don""t have this game yet,but I almost have enough money.I have [$$$].Ithink this game will be great!!!!!!! once I get it. I""m looking forward to duel Yu-Gi Moto.I hope this game boy game is Great!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!.I""m also looking forward to dueling ever one els too.Like Kaiba."
4,Yu-Gi-Oh! Takes Out All The Trash,"If you like Yu-Gi-Oh! Get this game. I would start out with Tristan he's really easy. Then Joey. Then Mai. Then Yugi. Then Mako. this game is especially great because unlike Forbidden Memories on Playstation, you don't need any starchips to get cards. You just have to advance your duelist level. I was able to use Blue Eyes White Dragon after only 20 victories. And after like 35 victories I was able to use Exodia unfortunetally you have to have about 700 deck capacity to carry it and no other good cards. (Not even 1 Celtic Guardian). So don't use Exodia untill like the end of the game. So definettly buy this game."
5,"Great Game! October 6, 2002","Warning: Dark Duel Stories can be addictive!When I first heard about it, I didn't expect much. I mean, c'mon!A Yu-Gi-Oh! GBC game! I thought that it would be ridiculously absured like the PokeMon game or something. Little did I know that it would be highly addictive and was a intrigueing game. You can play this game for literally hours! To make a long story short, I highly recommend this game! :)"
3,Mreh....,"The graphics were pretty good, but the horrific part was that you had to either buy ten thousand cards to get a good deck or continuously search for codes online. Although my game was pretty messed up, I couldn't go past Joey. I beat Tristin easily, but when I attempted to battle Yugi, it was the annoying Tea popping up and saying something about a Max-Card Limit. And the level of cards were very frustrating. So excuse me if I've made some sort of mistake, but overall this game is confusing and aggrivating in my opinion. But the battes are cool :)"
5,I LOVE THIS!!!,"THIS GAME IS GREAT!!!! I LOVE IT!!! EVEN IF YOU ARE NOT A BIG FAN OF THE SHOW, YOU WILL LOVE THIS!!! (AND REX IS SOOO CUTE!)"
1,I was told to remove my prior review,"I bought this game for my hubby and it would not work. I was to,d I was going to get my money back and another game. I got the game, but no money. If something's wrong with your game don't expect your money back."
3,awesome game for nostalgia,I remember having this game as a little kid and playing the hell out of it. Its really fun and easy to get the hang of. Its not the most 'accurate' of any of the handheld Yu-Gi-Oh games but in my opinion great for anyone who just wants a good time.
1,YGO DDS,"I don't even remember whether I finished this or not. Bad purchase, there are much better games out now, but even if there weren't I still wouldn't play this game. I am not endorsing this product, lol."
1,Don't bother.,"This book is horribly out of date and a complete waste of time. It still refers to Russia as the Soviet Union, and the Russia of today is a COMPLETELY different animal than it was in 1991, when this book was published.There are lots of pretty pictures and cutesy cartoons, but you will not learn Russian using this book. Even at it's cheap price, it's a waste of money. If you don't want to spend much, get the Lonely Planet phrasebook instead."
3,Just enough,"I agree that the book is horribly dated, but I don't think that makes it useless. In fact, I think the ""7 Days"" series can be very helpful for the right kind of reader with the right kind of goals. This book gives just enough more than a phrasebook that you feel like you have a chance when you go traveling. The grammar explanations and exercises are lighter than the ones in a ""Teach Yourself"" book, but that made me more likely to do them. There's enough grammar that you can sort of guess at how to say new things that aren't in the book. In that way it's better than a phrasebook. Russian grammar is far too complicated to pick up from a little book like this, but I don't think the book is intended to make you a fluent speaker of Russian. Though an updated version is well overdue, for the price, it's not a bad way to get ready for a trip."
2,Nice Piece from a Limited Line,"This is a very nice looking cake server that is highly polished and impressive to serve with. The price is also good. The front edge has a fairly sharp edge to slide under whatever you're serving.After quite a few uses, however, I am downgrading this item to two stars from four. I found a weak spot--literally. The blade is very sturdy and so is the hollow handle, but where they join, the metal is very thin. I found it bends easily when scooping up a large portion that is stuck to its tray, with icing, for example.Also, the rest of the line is quite limited. The other pieces like the spoons and tongs are poor functional designs. Thus, this item won't match anything else you own. My advice: if you use this (and the pie server) just for serving and you're gentle, you'll be OK."
5,Time for Europeans to reconsider the case of Knute Hamsun,"Brilliant cinamatic treatment of Hamsun's early masterpiece. Buy together with the film ""Hamsun"" with Max von Sydow and you'll understand why William Rose Benet's ""Readers Encyclopedia"", in it's latest edition no longer bears any references to Hamsun's so called Nazi sympathisizing in occupied Norway. Hamsun stylisticly broke ground for 4 generations of fiction writers from Hesse to Hemingway. Read Robert Ferguson's 1987 ""Enigma:The Life of Knute Hamsun"" to realize just how closely autobiographical the novel ""Hunger"" really was. Stunningly acted and photographed. Highly recommended."
2,"Huge, Thick, Cumbersome, Weighted Handle Spoon","The design of this spoon is terrible and KitchenAid dropped the ball on this one. The 'cupped' part is extremely thick - WAY TOO thick! I was going to use it as a basting spoon and a soup serving spoon but can't because the thick sides can't scoop up enough liquid for basting and odors of soup seasonings (especially garlic) linger on it. I can even smell the dishwasher detergent on it after it's been throughly washed. I wanted to send this back soon after it arrived from looking at it, but all that trouble for an $11.00 spoon??? NOOOO! I'll figure out something it will be useful for after my suspicions (plus even more problems) proved to be right. Maybe I'll scoop dry cat food with it. Wouldn't matter if it took up that smell, or....maybe I'll loan it out to women that say they only eat a 'spoonfull' of this food or that food on their diets. HA!!!"
4,Exact replacement works great,The blower motor and fan are a direct replacement for the factory motor and fan. They fit perfectly and plug-in with no issues at all. My only complaint is that the motor seems a little loud compared to the original. It may be that I have not heard the original in a while and am imagining how I would like it to sound.
5,blower motor,i bought this blower motor for my 2001 chevy 2500hd and it fits and works perfectly. great price really! and definitely recommend it. instead of a high price one from a dealership. does the same function and saves me cash.
2,Great Format yet I was still disappointed.,"This book just did not maintain my attention enough for me to complete it. I loved the idea and the short story format was excellent. Yet, the ""tone"" of the storyteller was boring. I felt that in trying to be witty and relay the stories with amusement and excitement, the authors sounded adolescent. Perhaps a sequel with more polished writing would be an improvement."
2,Others peoples memories,"I will not be reading this book again. It is a collection of other people's memories. In some of them you have no idea what they are talking about, unless you were there. Others are self-serving. Others are whiny. A few are amazing and give the insight I was hoping to see, but not enough. This is an excellent idea for a book, it just need to be written better."
5,Expose of the investor-owned electric utility business,"This is a detailed expose of overcharging for electricity by investor-owned utilities during the 1960s. It's full of exacting research and it's a great read to boot. And I'm not just saying that. In the March 9, 1967 New York Review of Books, Ernest Gruening called ""Overcharge,"" ""a blockbuster, and it should be read by every user of electric light and power. It describes and documents how the privately owned public electric utilities charge the consumer excessively, and by erecting and subsidizing an elaborate public relations structure, deceive their victims.""Overcharge: How Electric Utilities Exploit and Mislead the Public, and What You Can Do About Itby US Senator Lee Metcalf and Vic ReinemerDavid McKay, 338 pp"
3,Bravo Ratmansky!!!,"Alexey Ratmansky managed to re-vitalize an old Socialist propaganda ballet. His choreography builds on classic steps and has enough bravura to show the spectacular technique of the dancers yet it looks modern, with intriguing characterization. The story is still a bit much about the revolutionary masses to my taste, though a love story between a young aristocratic girl a peasant boy, improbable as it is in historical context, adds a lot of lyricism. Dancers are great in typical Bolshoi style: bombastic and lacking in nuance and restrain ( with some exception), but with spectacular technique bordering on acrobatics.Ballet is also well filmed: dancers shown full lengths so one can appreciate the dancing, just like Fred Astaire who insisted on being filmed in full height in his dancing sequences. It is overall a delightful Blu-Ray."
3,Not Bad,"Not so well written, a little manual-like and hard to read.Written for the beginner it tries to cover too much but misses out some important basic information.Have read many books on trading and had hoped to fill-in the details on the futures area fundamentals. Have to look for another book now though."
1,"""Seventh Heaven"" disk will not play","The dvd with Seventh Heaven on one side and The River on the other gets a ""dirty disk"" error on side A with Seventh Heaven. I have managed to get it to play a few seconds but it freezes up and starts over. I'm guessing it got scratched or otherwise damaged in the shoddy packaging that has been discussed here. (Separate issue: so little planning in the design of the package that you have to keep the cardboard chunks to prevent the books from sliding out of each end...)"
1,Short-lived Set of Canisters,"I bought a set of these canisters about a year ago, based on their similarity to a set I already owned. When these arrived, I discovered they were much more lightweight and lower quality than the ones I own, but I thought ""I'm only storing dry goods, surely they're good enough."" They seemed to be serving their purpose, until I plut the lid back on one of the containers tonight and it gifted me with a rather nasty sliver of metal in my finger!Since these appear to be flaking and dangerous, and I certainly don't want to eat metal slivers, I'll be throwing them out and replacing them with a set of good, airtight glass containers instead."
2,You get what you pay for,"So this is my first time returning something to Amazon... and I've outfitted my entire on the site... I bought these because I thought the trend in more recent reviews was saying they had improved the product. But they haven't. They don't look awful, but the plastic viewing pane is extremely cheap, mine were poorly fitted and the decorative grooves did not line up well and were scratched when I took them out of the box, and the metal is very very thin. There is a seal, so they may be airtight, but they just looked too cheap to keep in the kitchen. I also thought the big canister was just much too big for a city apartment. I guess I should have trusted the reviews"
2,Poor Quality Control - bought through Amazon,"I bought this canister set knowing the reviews about quality on the different Polder products because aethetically they fit my kitchen decor. Sure enough the 'windows' on two of hte canisters were angled rather than being perfectly vertical. I ignored it for a while, but it bothered me so much that I now use them for panty storage. I then bought the Polder with the horizontal line - again because of lack of aesthetic alternatives, and they lived up to the reviews - the metal popped out in wedges after a while. I think they don't use think enough metal.If you buy it, check it out carefully at the beginning while you can still return it."
5,"Nice, attractive set","I purchased this set a couple months ago... I keep flour in one canister, rice in another, and sugar packets in another. I haven't had any problems with bugs... As stated by another buyer, the canisters are not shiny stainless steel, but rather have more of a matte finish. I do like the finish... Finger prints do not show on them..."
2,Canisters store but not air or bug proof,"The seals are not air or water tight. There is no problem with the cansiter or the clear window, but I cannot store any flour or rice type products as the seals are not airtight and allow bugs in them. The canisters themselves do not rust and the lids are not easy to remove"
4,"Like them, don't like the customer service of Polder","I really like the look of these canisters. They look great on my counter...matching my stainless appliances. However, the large canister is anything BUT airtight. Quite loose as a matter of fact. I wrote to Polder's customer service online THREE times and was totally ignored. Either that or they don't check their email at all. I wrote over a 3 week period. I am kind of disappointed that I can not get an airtight fit and get absolutely NO help from the company who made them.EDIT: Hurray, Amazon! I called Amazon customer service shortly after writing this review and they sent me a whole new set! I send the other ones back. Thanks Amazon for great customer service!!"
1,Windows didn't seal properly,"I did quite a bit of research (or so I thought) into canisters before I chose these. I wasn't really wanting to spend $100+ on All-Clad canisters, which consistently get good reviews, and many of the flip-top types I'd seen looked a bit flimsy. So I went with these, classic looking and mid-priced. Unfortunately, when I put flour into the large canister and closed the lid, flour squirted out the canister ""window"". I'm not sure if I just got a bad set, but definitely sending back and won't be buying these again."
3,Okay...not jumping outta my chair!,"These look beautiful in my kitchen with the rest of the stainless steel items. They are hard to open. The lid seems to be impossible to pull of like it was made just a little too big for the opening. The plastic window feels cheap and cracked 2 days after I got the set. I even noticed that after about a week of keeping the sugar in the large canister, that it turned into a huge, hard clump that was difficult to use, so I had to toss it. The set is okay if you don't expect too much, but if I had it to do over, I would go with a different set."
4,What I needed for stuff,"I have been shopping for a set of canisters for many years but they were all too small. A bag of flour would never even half fit in the largest of most canisters. The largest of these (4 quart{16 cups}) will hold all but a little bit of a bag of flour. I like the look of the stainless steel and the fact of the seal around the lid. The only draw back to this product is the acrylic window in the side. I was afraid I would poke it out when I washed it by hand (it feels flimsy), but it turned out okay. They look great and the ability to see how much sugar and flour you have without opening the lid is a plus."
4,"Serve their purpose, but not anything extraordinary","Amazon had a significantly better price on these than BBB had them locally. When I looked at the display of canisters at BBB, these seemed to have the cleanest look to match my kitchen appliances with a respectable seal. One of them came with really strange dents like a jar when you try to loosen the lid with a butter knife. They weren't bad enough to bother with returning the set though. I might be the only one to notice.The canisters are pretty good sized. I have standard coffee filters in the smallest if that tells you anything.They have an odd smell, so plan to wash with really hot soapy water prior to use. The little windows seem to have a really good seal.I would definitely buy these again at Amazon's price. They look good and serve the purpose of keeping the items sealed and tidy looking."
1,"It is really cheap looking. If you have Le Creusets and All Clads in your kitchen, don't buy this","It is really cheap looking, like made in China cheap. If you have Le Creusets, All Clads, and Shuns knives in your kitchen, this doesn't deserve to hold your ingredients. The metal is really thin, and the window is this thing film of plastic, like thinner than the plastic of a mayo squeeze jar.I should have just went to my local WORLD MARKET/ COST PLUS and picked up the latch one that will be the same price but twice the strength."
5,Expectations Met,"Not only are the canisters functional but they are easyto keep clean, look great and best of all remind you whenyou are low an ingredient, no more mad dashes to the storein the middle of baking Thanks AmazonP S The cannister arrived in two days"
2,not durable,"have had these for a couple years now. the plastic ""window"" has cracked from the pressure of the sugar and flour. these also are not air tight and my sugar was never fresh."
2,Did not stand the test of time,"I loved these canisters for about 2 years. Now, they are useless. They do not close properly and do not keep a seal. I was hoping for a product I could keep on my shelves for a decade. This was not the product."
3,so close and yet not quite what I had in mind,"I have been looking for a set of --4--SS canisters for years. I bought an extra med size one so I have one for flour and three sugars (white, brown and powdered). The canisters are exactly the sizes I wanted, but the plastic window is really thin. I'm buying a different set and passing these down to someone else."
2,"Hard to open, cheap, shows finger prints","I bought these for my kitchen at Christmas. In the little space that I have, the canisters were a little too big ""round"" and of different sizes round. I would have rather gotten some that were equally round or square for the space that I have. (just keep that in mind) More importantly, I thought the canisters looked cheap compared to the photo description. The clear window in front is lined with a dull finish and makes the canisters look cheap. Also, the canister are somewhat hard to open when you are trying to bake or cook. Something with a nob, handle or lift would have been better and easier to open. I tend to get the canisters all dirty with finger prints when I try and lift them off. :( Thus, I'm cleaning them all the time. I think I will purchase some replacement ones only after having these a week."
1,DO NOT BUY! You will just have to return it!,"I was so excited to have gotten a great deal on a sleek stainless steel canister set! But when I received them, I was incredibly dissapointed with the quality. On two out of the three of the canisters, there was some sort of glue stuck to the outside of the canisters by the window of the canister that could not be removed. It made it look like it was poorly made and when I felt the clear window on each canister, I found that these are made out of cheap plastic that I can move and press in with my fingers. Overall, I must say I was expecting a beautiful set and received cheap, poorly made canisters. Don't waste your money!"
4,As Hoped For,"We have been using our Polder canister set for a few months now, and everythingis as we hoped. The quality of containers, lids, windows, and seals is alljust fine.The lids are a simple pressure fit, with flexible gaskets to make a seal. You just have to be sure your fingers are on the lid not the body of the canister to get them off nicely. We would not hesitate to order these again."
2,Disappointed,I ordered 2 sets of these canisters. I was very disappointed when I opened them. The 2 quart canister in one order was damaged because the window was not placed correctly in manufacturing. The 4 quart canister had a scratch on the window. I contacted the seller and was sent out a whole new set very quickly. I feel that these two sets should not have been sent out in the first place. What's happening to quality control?
3,more information please,Appropriately the canisters should be individually described so that many cooks would fit canisters to avaialble space.
5,Ward Albro rules!,Another fine example of this scholar's work in Mexico. Albro leaves no stone unturned.
3,Silicone slotted turner,"While the silicone is great, the turner is probably best for Sunday morning pancakes. It is too large for everyday stirring, and a bit cumbersome. It also takes a lot of drawer space, with it's big face and fat handle. A smaller, thinner version would be terrific."
5,Great addition to my Mini,"When I first bought my Mini, I didn't really check out all the capabilities and purchased an inexpensive USB drive to use for backup. I found out later that the Mini won't boot from a USB drive, but will from a Firewire drive. I searched several possibilities and picked the LaCie 160GB because of capacity and price. It boots flawlessly and gives me more space than I will hopefully ever use. I partitioned the drive to have an image of the built-in drive plus a large area for archiving files that I don't necessarily need on my main drive I use SuperDuper! for backups and do an incremental backup weekly."
1,Please dont buy this... you will regret it...,"this is the crappiest electronic equipment i have ever bought since a wireless headphone (which im going to comment on as soon as i finish here) i bought.I cant copy anything, everything gives an error, im talking about files of 20 mbs tops!I managed to save my entire music library because i turned on the AC and a fan so it doesnt overheat. I read that solution on a mac forum because Lacie doesnt even bother to tell you temporary solutions...Its really bad, trust me this is my first comment on a product and its because im really pissed off."
2,for really short people,"The handle is really short. I am 5'3"" and it still makes me lean way over to do the floors. The bristles were fairly stiff when I first got it but after about the third time using it they really softened up. This is a waste of money."
3,Back Saver,"I clean the house of an elderly man on the weekends. He has a scrub brush similar to this. I was hoping that it was the same. Using it is easier on my back. I only gave it 3 stars, because I like his better. The bristles are alittle softer and more flexible. This will do for now."
5,So glad I baught this.,"Used it to clean my bath tub...no more getting on my knees to scrub the tub. Made it so easy. I can use it to scrub the tub, shower, tiles, and even my drive way. The bristles are just right for the job, not to soft and not to hard."
2,Bristles are stiff,"I bought this to clean some hard-to-reach places under my outdoor stairs and in the eves of the house. The bristles are stiff and too short, making it difficult to use. You get what you pay for. :-("
2,"Fall short of expectation, can be valuable to others...","This book can be of immense value if your organization doesn't have a mature Configuration Management process and supporting build procedure.I was hoping to learn best practices around practical challenges we face. The book fell short of expectation, may be I was expecting much more from someone who played the Build Master role for a very complex software.No doubt this book will increase the awareness around a critical process area for organizations struggling to manage multiple streams of activities, but don't search for the silver-bullets from this book."
2,Rather Useless,"The book contains mostly trivia about how Microsoft manages the build process, and from a high level point of view at that. I suspect that very few readers will find much to take home. Overall, a very superficial treatment of the subject."
1,Do Not Buy This Book,"This book is simply awful. It offers virtually no useful advice, and is full of completely obvious recommendations. The only thing I gleaned from reading this book is that disabling virus protection on your build machines speeds up the build time."
4,A very useful book,"This is a sorely needed book for anyone in the process of managing or introducing an automated build process into a development team. There is nothing ground-breaking here for experienced managers, however, it's a great reference book and covers all the major areas of concern regarding the build process. I've also found it to be a very useful resource to help build consensus in the team regarding the why the need for a build process and how to define it. This neatly fills a void in the book market."
2,sketchy,"The fact that the author has been working for Microsoft and that he managed to get a foreword written by Jeffrey Richter do a good marketing job, but the book is disappointing.No issue is treated in detail, and instead too many obvious remarks are provided (such as ""Test the product fully before shipping..."" or ""No hardware is allowed to enter or leave the build lab without a team member's okay"").The only valuable idea is the so called Virtual Build Lab, which is nothing more than a separate codeline for a sub-project, which is merged to the real mainline only when it is stable enough. This idea comes naturally in big sized projects.Berczuk book on Software Configuration Management is by far a much better choice."
5,Great stuff,"I really enjoy this on whole grain or low carb toast in the morning. The other review here describes the texture of this product exactly! It has a very organic, authentic flavor and is not loaded with junk carbs and corn syrup like American jams are! I got a case of 9 jars and will certainly be ordering more when the time comes. I warn anyone with kids that they may not appreciate the neutral flavor of this product and they may take some time to appreciate it's taste. Sadly, most kids in the US will not eat anything that isn't loaded with tons of sugar!:( what a great, nutritious product!!"
5,ACAi,I am trying the Perricone Promise diet.I received this item in a timely manner and well packaged.
1,"Wheewwww, soemthing stinks! Wait, no, it's just this game.","This is perhaps the most unenjoyable game I have played in my life. It would have been a disgrace on nintendo 64, but for xbox, it is utterly ridiculous. The graphics are okay, but the racing is monotonous, all the boards are essentially the same. The physics suck, and there are too few trucks to choose from. I couldn't play this for more than an hour at a time."
1,this game just plain out [stinks],"this game is horrible. the graphics look like they came from the n64, the racing is easy, and the vehicles look stupid. and the free roam isnt as great as everyone thinks.4x4 evo 2 has it too, and its a lot better. no one likes a game with terrible physics. yeah you might be able to jump from a waterfall, but just wait till you hit the ground. NOTHING HAPPENS. you just plop down on the ground like nothing. its like the game doesnt let you bounce around like a real 4x4 would. this game is bad and recommend it to no one. get 4x4 evo 2 for a real off-road game"
3,a decent game at best,"This game was a really good game for about the first hour that I played it, then I was already bored with it! The cars are cool and the places are fun, but you just cant play this game everyday and have fun with it! Overall I think its not that much fun."
4,Great multiplayer fun.,"Let's start out by saying that I never bought this game for a realistic four wheeling adventure. Anyone who wants to claim that any of the 4x4 games out there are realistic has never broken an axle Jeeping down a mountainside. If you want authentic outdoor experiences, leave your living room. However if its a cold and rainy day and you have some friends over tryout the multiplayer ""King of the hill"" mode. This is the one reason I love this game so much. As for the graphics, well they arent great but getting pumped up by the music and knocking your friends around makes up for it."
3,"Unrealistic, but fun","If you are looking for a good off-road driving simulation, this is not the game for you. The graphics are average at best and the driving model is very arcade-like. There is no vehicle damage, and jumps are insane.HOWEVER, the forgiving driving model is great for younger kids who can't control more serious driving games. My 5 year old and I have a great time racing each other with this game.It also has a career mode where you can earn vehicle upgrades by winning races. The ""tracks"" that are available are a bit limited, but they are a lot of fun, especially the jumps."
4,Test Drive Offroad,My son loves this game. We received the product in a timely manner. My only complaint would be that it did not come with the case. It may have been listed that the case was NOT included and I just missed it.
4,Best 4x4 off-road game,"My kids love the game.Myself,I would not be so generous.Good Graphics and some fun but lacks originality.Would be more realistic with cab view and a more lively environment."
2,Test Drive Off Road is way off course,I bought this game for my XBOX and expected a decent offroad racing game with good graphics and got neither. No skill is required to play this game and the graphics are a direct port from some other game console with little or no enhanced features for the XBOX.I addition menu selection is further complicated by requiring use of the directional pad instead of the thubstick the rest of the game is played with. If you are looking for a decent racing game or an offroad game look elswhere. Not worth $(...)!
4,Fun Game,"I love this game, it's easy and fun to play. The graphics are good and there are a variety of courses and vehicles to choose from. I like this game much better than 4x4, yes the graphics are better in 4x4 but Test drive is just more fun."
3,Not what i expected,I did not expect only a pendant...but a chain as there is one in the picture. Then the pendant has a hole in it and is not lined up well. Actually i should have gone to the local walmart and bought one...would have been cheaper and included a chain... My fault for expecting more than was being offered
1,For light mashing only,"This tool bent badly the first time I used it. I had to bend it back myself several times, in the midst of mashing four potatoes. Messy hassle."
5,THIS ALBUM ROCKS!!!!!,"EXCEPTION TO THE RULE by TOMMY CASTRO just rocks. It has a good blend of blues, soul and rock that is totally lacking from most of the music that is popular today. (Can u say N'SYNC or BRITTNEY SPEARS). Tommy has a great soulful voice, and on this album his backing band is top notch. Being from the San Francisco area, I have heard of Tommy for awhile and I can say that I dig his music. HOW LONG MUST I CRY is a slow blues song that Tommy really delivers the goods on. HAD ENOUGH, EXCEPTION TO THE RULE, NASTY HABITS, SHO' ENOUGH are rockin songs that showcase the bands talents as a whole. If you are a fan of the blues and of good music, then I highly recommend this album for you."
3,Great Discovery.,"Castro can play and sing with the best of 'em. The addition of the saxaphone really takes it to a different, more R nad B level. That element gives his blues and wider range and gives his sound a trademark that seperates him from others. I like my blues a little more on the energetic side rather than the slow-burning side, and he delivers it here."
5,I can't quit listening to it!!!,"This is some hot blues, played by one REALLY hot guitarist...the singin' is pretty tough,too!"
2,Nothing new or fun,"This game doesn't have any special features, and it is not very fun. it seems to be based on the SuperNintendo version of Madden, and that seems underpar for a 32 bit system."
3,Is this the Super Nintendo?,"Madden football does not translate well on such a small screen. Graphics look more like the older Madden games from the 16 bit SNES era. The players are too big and the screen seems over crowded. It's nearly impossible to find holes for running backs to exploit with 22 players jammed onto such a small screen at one time. And incomplete passes look as if they are hovering in the air just waiting to be picked off. On the plus side, the sound and voice effects are decent and all 32 teams including the expansion ""Houston Texans"" are there, with updated rosters and playbooks, plus the usual ""All Madden"" teams. Madden 2002 is not a bad game by any means and is pretty fun to play, but it's not a classic that I've come to love this series by either! Maybe 2003!"
4,Good all purpose turner,Calling it short is a misnomer - it's not that short - it's an average size. It has a rather bulky handle that is comfortable to hold but difficult to store. The turner itself is a little on the thick side so lighter foods don't always want to cooperate but I'm pleased with it. I wouldn't buy a matching spoon becuase of the bulky handle - takes up too much room in my drawer.
5,Alan and Jeff,"Both Alan Rickman and Jeff Bridges are very enjoyable to watch and listen to. It was quite a surprise for me that Charlie Rose was not so well-informed as I expected him to be in his interview with Alan Rickman...Of course, this DVD is a must-have for all fans of JB and/or AR."
5,"Marya's review of, ""If I were your Mother""","""If I were your Mother"" is a great book for mothers to share with their daughters. In the story, a little girl explains how she'd treat her mother if her mom were her daughter. The daughter realizes that the thing that matters the most to her is the love that her mother gives to her daughter. The illustrations are in fun colors and convey the soft, loving message of the book. I really like the book!"
1,non stick basket,"Very hard to open and close,makes it hard to put food in.a round one would be idea,but hard to fine"
3,Not very friendly when you try put the two halves together,THe two halves of the basket do not fit together very well. You have to fight with them to get them to fit. If the wires where you put the spit for the rotiierie were bigger it would be no problem .
2,nope!,"it is okay for one or two people, it does not lock together, very very hard to install on the bar, was not pleased with it at all!"
3,"Lovely colors/design, poor material","I didn't realize that it was sort of thin material, semi-transparent, and not very stretchy"
5,great rpg that rivals final fantasy,"alright maybe the graphics of this game may be nothing to the amazing cg squaresoft puts out, dq VII is staight out one of the longest and most inovative rpg out there. the story itself has amazing cliches and one of the best build up after battles you can have. With the many job classes and skills that this game offers you will be wanting to master each one and it's incredibly addicting and that is one of the best parts of this game. Of course this game will suck any social life you once had and have you glued to the tv for the next weeks to come after you buy this game."
5,Dragon Warrior 7,"Dragon Warrior 7 is filled with classic old school roleplaying based on the actual gaming experience as opposed to watching movies and cinematic breaks on many other newer games. This game retains the same battle engine and same format as the original 4 NES games only slightly tweaking and improving it. The graphics are slightly improved just enough to stay with the times as well. But Dragon Warrior was never about graphics, it was about the gameplay experience. This game has a great story, lots of play value(over 100 hours) and brings back that nostalgia of palying the originals."
3,Ammm.,"I was kind of disappointed with the game, but only because I have played the game that comes after it, Dragon Quest 8. I just couldn't compare to that game and well, I haven't played it but once."
1,Booorrr-ing.,"Bah, I found Dragon Warrior 7 seriously lacking in all aspects and wish I would have rented it Before I bought it. I stuck with it for about five or six hours, and when the game still failed to interest me, I gave up. The fighting is just as boring as the storyline, and the plot seems to fall out of no where into your lap with little explanation as to how the son of a fisherman would be best buds with the Prince. Furthermore, there's just no excuse for those horrible graphics, other then laziness. The cut scenes don't even have a small bit of sound, like walking or a rock slate being slid open. I'm all for games that focus on storyline before graphics, but this one dropped the ball in Both areas. This game seems to be one either you love or you hate, from the mix reviews I've seen, so I'd encourage you to try out a friends copy first unless you know and love the series."
1,HT,SUP I 'M WRITING FOR A BET DON'T BUY OR NOT BUY RHIS BECAUSE OF ME. THE GRAPHICS RULE THE BEST EVER. THE STORY LINE IS THE WORST. SOMETHING ABOUT A DRAGON KING THINGNIE MIGEIE BOBER WHATEVER. IF YOU LIKE GAMES WITH INTRESTING PLOTS THAT ARE FUN DONT BUY THIS . I WISH I CAN GIVE THIS GAME 0 STARS
3,Nice product!! TOO FRAGILE!!,"This is a great idea and I absolutely love it, except it is very fragile and breaks extremely easily. I am not hard on anything and I have had two in two months and both have broken right away. Very flimsy plastic. Make sturdier and it will be a great product."
4,A MUST for fans of NEW ORLEANS BLUES!!!,"This is one of the quintessential artists of New Orleans R&B. She is a veteran of the 3AM club scene of the French Quarter and a virtual powerhouse vocalist - once you've been in the front row of one of her shows and left dripping with MarvaSweat, you'll know the energy involved here! This album runs the gamut: from raw blues nuggets like ""Bluesiana..."" to gospel-drenched classics like ""Don't miss Your Water"", as well as playful Mardi-Gras-ish tunes. Treat yourself to this one - it won't disappoint."
4,Classic old-fashioned R&B,"Marva Wright is a gifted New Orleans born vocalist and occasional songwriter (she wrote four of the songs on this album) who on this album sings up a storm. I was fortunate enough to see her live in New Orleans in 1999, and as well as being a great R&B; singer she was also a really friendly person who signed my copy of this CD.Even if you're interested in Blues and Gospel you probably won't recognise all the titles on this album. Some are very well known and others quite obscure. They are all performed in a vocal style, that sometimes reminded me of Aretha Franklin. Theres lots of backing vocals, Hammond B-3 & Harmonica and occasional use of a brass section. My favourite track is the funky 'Let's Make Love' (one of her own compositions).Overall well worth getting and an album that will grow on you."
1,"PURE, UNADULTERATED GARBAGE!!","This drive was D.O.A. on arrival. All beauty no brains. Forced me to face the fact that in recent years, LaCie has shipped my company a lot of corpses or their drives have failed prematurely. The driver CD caused my mini's dvd-rom to whig out. The drive does not do that with ANY other CD or DVD. LaLosers is a better name for this company. Let the buyer beware!"
2,"Love the look, and it worked great until it died.","I bought two of these, one started to make a horrible noise within the first few days. I sent it in and received a new one. About a year later it died, then a few months after that the other one died. I love the design I just wish it would have lasted longer and been more dependable."
2,"Worked well for two years, then failed. Power adapter issue, turns out.","I bought this a couple of years ago as a back-up drive, and eventually had to move my photo library to it because I ran out of internal hard drive space. However, as of two days ago it no longer mounts on my desktop, and is likely toast. I hadn't backed up my photos from 2009 (shame on me). I'm really hoping that Diskwarrior can help recover my data. I wouldn't buy a LaCie again.Update: turns out the power adapter died and when I replaced it, the drive worked fine. Now there just is not enough hard drive space for my uses."
4,Overall pretty good,"The drive looks good, performs well. The extra ports are a very welcome addition and it comes with extra cables.My only (very minor) complains are that:1) it's a little bit noisy... noisier than the Mac mini for sure.2) The big LaCie logo in the front clashes with the mini's smooth front look.3) The firewire port in the back and the power button don't line up with the mini's. Maybe it used to line up with the PPC version. Whatever.4) The power light is brighter than the mini's.I recommend this product."
3,Top Heavy,"Love the color, love the material (silicone), but the spoon falls out of most pots and bowls because the handle is so top heavy. It gets frustrating!"
1,Poor design,"This spoon is poorly designed. The spoon part is too thick to get at the bottom of the pan. It is heavy. The handle is too long and off balance. I would not purchase any more Kitchen Aide Products,"
3,Not compatible with HDMI,"This card has DVI output, but does not work with an HDMI TV. HDMI is DVI video plus copy protection plus audio. ATI did not say why it didn't work, but they ""escalated"" the problem to see if there was anything they could do. Never heard back from them. Doing some research I think the problem is their implementation of DVI does not output HDCP (the copy protection scheme built-in in HDMI). My PowerBook's DVI output works just fine with the same cable/adaptor and TV so I know for sure the problem is the card. I had to return this card as it was intended to be used with my big screen TV."
4,Works fine for me,The card works great and I have no problems with it exept for one. If you plan on using Final Cut Pro don't get it. FCP doesn't support PCI video cards. It only works with AGP cards. Everything else is just fine.
2,Deception totale...,Altogether a very disappointing disc. Neither the prise de son nor the state of instrument tuning show Souvigny at its best--certainly a surprise given the good work that the Temperaments label has done with other discs. Heurtematte's performance runs from cautious to outright stultifying. French Classic music ought soar with a giant ear-to-ear grin...this disc ever gets beyond an earthbound shrug.
4,Recommended for would-be bowlers,The author takes the effort to filter out the technical junks that might confuse new bowlers or people who are interested to take up the sports. All you need to know to get started is there. But it's a little pricey for a thin paperback.
2,Quite outdated figures and pictures.,"Too simple, too brief and quite out-dated figues and pictures illustration. Anyone buy this book and hopping to learn something out from it will be quite disappointed."
4,A Mess In Harlem (token),"This story was Chester Himes intro to the 2 detectives ""Coffin Ed"" Jones (Count Off!) and ""Grave Digger"" Johnson (Straighten Up!). The plot was thought out carefully. Characters came alive, and each scene was fully picturesque. This wasn't only a rage in Harlem, but it was a mess of a crime with Johnson's dumb love for Imabelle. This story is going to keep you in awe, keep you laughing, but at the same time saying ""What a Mess In Harlem""."
3,Makes One Appreciate Walter Mosley Even More ...,"This is definitely better than ""The Real Cool Killers,"" but isn't the best crime novel in the 20th Century. Thank goodness others such as Walter Mosley built off Himes' craft."
1,if you have to throw away $150...,"If you actually buy this book you're paying for the illustrations. Don't waste your time actually reading it, the presentation of the material is ponderous and completely unimaginative. The chapter on immunology is one of the worst I've seen anywhere.The COVER of the book speaks volumes for its content. I'd be afraid to be seen in public with it."
1,DO NOT EXPECT TO RECEIVE WHAT YOUR ARE PROMISED FOR YOUR PURCHASE,"I purchased this book NEW and in good faith & because it was the title required for my anatomy class. (from the college bookstore)The company NEVER made good on their promise to allow me access to use their website. They provided the professor an invalid access code.I can only have access if I send them MORE money to purchase access.I ALREADY GAVE THEM 150+ for the NEW text, lab manual, cd's & entry into their website. It feels like I am being SCAMMED although I am pretty sure this is not their intention.I am 1/3 of the way done w/the book & class & DISSAPPOINTED W/MY PURCHASE.I HOPE TEACHERS FIND AN ALTERNATIVE BOOK TO REQUIRE FOR A&P; CLASS."
3,X and Y chromosomes,"A more serious omission is the absense of the x chromosome from the glossary though that y is there, unconsciously reinforcing that men are incomplete females? Males come equipped with beefed up sixpacks whereas the woman look like demure little housewives. Artists have tried to depict other races but the gender representation is pathetic. A heterosexist pro-male interpretation of human sexuality is found throughout the book, which can be annoying. Some of the comments obviously written with students in mind are patronizing. The layout is repetitious and and at times quite unstimulating. The best detail was why a chicken breast is white considering its a muscle."
3,Good R&B blues,"'Outside Lookin'In' is an improvement on his first release 'Too Tough'. Studebaker John offers good old R&B blues. The highlights are 'Blue Feeling' (once it gets warms up), 'Shake' and 'You done me wrong'. As with first album, the best moments are when he plays both harp and guitar. Check out 'Time will tell' and 'Tremoluxe' for better overall results."
4,My Favorite Blues Cd,"This is one of the best blues cd's ever.The opening lick on Shake is perfect.BUY this cd and enjoy!If you have a chance to see him in concertdo so, his shows are even better than therecordings."
2,rent only,"This game is only so-so. It reminds me too much of Motocross Mania on PS1. Unlike MX 2002 with RC, in this game you sort of just hold the throttle on and steer around the track. Although the framerate never slows down, and is much faster than MX 2002, it doesn't makethe game is any more fun. And there are a few quirks which are irksome...If you hit the brakes, the bike stops and takes a few seconds to get up to speed, and in that time most of the pack will pass you. It's almost impossible to crash, and if you fail to make a corner instead of crashing you will bounce straight up in the air.The amount of tracks is a plus, but they all seem the same. There is nothing distictive about them, and after a few laps you won't know the difference between Namur or any other track. The tracks are all grainy looking, which is kind of a bummer considering the other games on PS2 and their clarity.I would recommend renting first, and if you like it after a few days, then purchase."
2,"""Slope Glider""","I don't own this but the description sayes ""Slope Glider"" but the picture shows a propeller. slope gliders don't have power systems, so this could make you quite disappointed when you get it!"
2,Not So Great,"Not only was the book silly, but I found the story very confusing and contrived.I'll give the second installment a shot, but I wasn't impressed at all considering all the good reviews I've read of this series."
3,4 and 20 Blackbirds Baked In A Pie,This story is a good even read until the end and then it lays a big egg. It's a stupid ending and a real let down. I hope the other stories in the series are MUCH better!
5,A fun mystery,"Set in the upper echelons of Pennsylvania society, and written in the first person, the story follows Nora Blackbird as she searches for the killer of her millionaire boss and family friend. Recently penniless (her parents move to a resort that caters to tax evaders, leaving her with the family estate and a two million dollar tax bill), Nora must find her sisters, who disappear, complete her job as a society page columnist, and resist the charms of a mobster's gorgeous son.Although I found the motive for the murder far-fetched, and some of the other key characters a little underdeveloped, the character of Nora is refreshingly real and relatable. The plot moves along at a good pace, and ending wraps up the story quite well. A pleasure to read, and I look forward to the next books (this is the first in the ""Blackbird Sisters Mystery Series"")."
4,Fun To Read,"This is my first Nancy Martin book. I instantly liked the characters and the story kept my attention. Has a nice bit of humor too. Looking forward to reading the next one. I'm a huge fan of Mary Kay Andrews (a.k.a. Kathy Trochek) and these are similiarly fun to read, but not as in depth. Good summer book."
2,Really tough going,"I guess I was hung up from the outset on the $2,000,000 (two million) dollar ""property tax"" lien. How on earth could Nora EVER pay that off? And her parents racking up THAT kinda debt and still living lavishly in the Caribbean? Too cute and improbable to me. Better they should've been killed off.That aside, the writing is mediocre at best. This is NOT Stephanie Plum quality by a longshot! The second star is borderline, and only because this book would serve to kill time if necessary; I did manage to [barely] finish it.IF the author were to try a different series, I'd consider reading the first of that one, but the rest of this - nope - no way."
2,Overrated.,"This book was recommended to me by a friend who shares with me an interest in Jennifer Crusie. Unfortunately, I did not enjoy this book in the least. The characters seemed flat; I didn't find myself caring especially what happened to them. The plot also seemed rushed and the details in the book weren't written in a way that gave any sense of ""visual"" appeal. I am currently majoring in English, and I have seen fresher, more descriptive, and overall much better writing from my student contemporaries than was displayed in this particular novel. All in all, I was NOT impressed with this book. I will not be reading the rest of the series."
3,Beach Book,"Mix Stephanie Plum and Goldy Shulz, shake well. In the end, you have this new series. The protagonist is fairly sensible, the relatives wacky, and the scenery delightful. And, who doesn't want to read about a rich, debutante finding herself in debt and having to work for a living? Although the mystery was not perfect, the book is still a good, fun read. I look forward to reading the next in the series."
5,Fun new series,"Nora Blackbird's world has been turned upside down. Her husband was killed during a drug deal and her socialite parents have fled to a tropical tax haven to escape creditors. Her sisters got the furniture and art collection and Nora got the family farm and the two million dollar tax bill. She manages to get a job as a social reporter for a family friend's newspaper, but the friend ends up murdered at a party. Nora's curiosity gets the better of her, especially when a folio of erotic art is given to her by her sister to return to the estate. Nora wants to know who killed Rory and why. She has the help of Mick Abruzzo whether she wants it or not.This is a promising new series. The three Blackbird sisters are very quirky from Emma's horse obsession to Nora's fainting spells. The plot is entertaining without being too far fetched and I look forward to the next installment of the series."
3,Intriguing beginning,"It's not often that I get to begin a series at the beginning. (It took me decades to work my way back to the first Parker/Spenser book.) So I enjoyed following along as the author both set up and solved a mystery and introduced a cast of characters we just know will be reappearing later in the series. Like the Amanda Pepper mysteries by Gillian Roberts, this book is set in Philadelphia, a city I have great affection for. The story itself is not that complex -- Nora is no VI Warshawski or Kay Scarpetta. But it was entertaining and the end really surprised me. The only problem I had -- and from reading some of the other reviews here, I may be alone in this -- is that while I liked the heroine, I really had little use for Emma and Libby, her sisters. I guess I was supposed to find them eccentric and charming, but instead they annoyed me. I expect to come back and revisit this series, so maybe they'll grow on me."
2,Disappointed...,"I was disappointed with this mystery. I've read quite a few, but I found this story a little dull, and the characters not particularrly strong."
2,Didn't keep my interst,"I thought the idea of sisters who fell on hard times solving murders would be interesting, but this book did not keep my interest. The murder was badly handled, the sisters aren't that interesting. I won't be reading the rest of the series."
5,Very enjoyable,I'll start by saying what's wrong with this book. Rucker must have had a really bad marriage as he uses his wife in his books rather negatively. But even with this he writes a fantastic book. I can look at the technology that he describes and almost see it in use today. No magic but solid tech. And the story fits so well with the genre of both cyberpunk and today's news. I really wish this book was in print for others to read.
4,This is REAL cyberpunk!,"Okay, maybe Gibson has more style (whatever that means) butRucker's got the technical know-how. What a surprise - ac-punk writer who actually understands what he's writingabout! Oh yeah, and it's a great story, too."
5,This is the perfect book for learning about the Internet.,"This book taught me more about the Internet and Web when I first read it in 1994 than any other book, magazine or article. In 1999, the ""science fiction"" in it has largely become reality, while other parts of it will hit the market in the near future.When the paperback comes out, I will buy many copies to share with older friends who seem ""afraid"" of the Net. I also recommend the book for literature classes at both the high school and college level. The blend of science with human reality is mature and sophisticated, making the novel crossover from sci-fi to literature."
2,Loved the -ware books; hated this one.,"Well, I didn't really hate it. After reading others by this author, I snapped up the Hacker & the Ants when I saw it. I finished it only because it kept seeming capable of being redeemed. It wasn't. I was very disappointed. Looking at the publication dates of this and his others will tell you all you need to know."
1,Not Worth the Price,"When view in person, this pendant looks cheap and poorly-made. It would be best suited as toy jewelry for very young kids to play with."
4,"Very nice, but not as pictured","A very nice spoon but it's a ""slotted"" spoon -- not a solid spoon as in the picture."
2,Not as expected,"I like the thickness of the spoon but did not like the length of the spoon, it would have been perfect if it was few more inches long."
3,"Works, but I have a better idea...","I bought this product to get rid of crabgrass in my St Augustine. It worked well on the crabgrass, but as others have said it does not go very far. The technique I used was to use the mist setting on a garden hose nozle and mist the crabgrass before and after applying the powder just enough to make it stick. After emptying the container I looked at the ingredients and decided to try making my own mixture. I refilled it with a mixture of 50% flour, 50% baking soda, and about 1/3 cup ground cinnamon. It worked just as well at a fraction of the cost. The crabgrass in my yard is finally gone! Make your own and save your money!"
5,"Works great, but can be expensive for large areas","This stuff is great at killing crabgrass. It does yellow some of the surrounding lawn, but my lawn bounced right back while the crabgrass withered away. The only downfall is that the shaker bottle is hard to use effectively over large areas. If you have a confined patch of crabrass, then its easy to apply this stuff directly and kill it. But If you have bits of crabgrass here and there over your entire lawn, you effectively have to sprinkle your entire lawn with this stuff, and one bottle really doesn't go very far. But still, despite that drawback, its the only post-emergent killer I've found that actually works, so I use it, even on the large areas."
2,"works OK, but application is difficult","I used this crabgrass killer last summer and it DID kill the crabgrass without hurting my New England lawn (predominately fescue). HOWEVER, the product does not ""activate"" unless the ENTIRE crabgrass leaf is completely wet and covered with the fine powder (the product turns yellow to indicate that it has been activated). It is nearly impossible to get the crabgrass ""wet enough"" to activate the product and if there is even the slightest breeze, forget applying the product as the fine-grained powder will blow all over the place. The applicator clogs (because you are shaking it on wet grass) and does not make for easy application. Since crabgrass spreads so quickly, this product is not practical at all for large areas (i.e., pretty much everybody's lawn). Stick to corn gluten for an organic, pre-emergent option for crabgrass control."
5,BETTER THAN SLICED BREAD,This is a great product and it works as directed. It kills only the crabgrass and St. Augustine grass is uneffected. I use it in Florida. The product is expensive so it is best to get the crabgrass when it is just starting up in a small area. It is important that the grass is wet before you sprinkle it on and it doesn't rain for 24 hours after application.
3,Didn't eliminate crabgrass,"I followed the instructions precisely and did 2 applications about 3 weeks apart but the crabgrass is still there. It definitely made the grass turn yellow in the application spots but when we mowed several days later, the yellow part got mowed off & the crabgrass was still there. To be completely fair, the weeds were pretty extensive in my yard but based on my experience with this product, it is not an effective treatment."
1,Poor Results - Cannot Recommend,"Sorry, but this product not only did not work, but it also killed the surrounding centipede grass and while the crabgrass is returning, the surrounding centipede is not. I used two bottles per the instructions and while the results showed within 2-3 days and it rained on the 3rd day, everything was killed. I was very disappointed in the results.There is no way that I can recommend such an expensive product that just doesn't work as advertised. Too bad, because there is a good market for this product."
2,"OK, but too thick and too hard","This product is OK, but it contains too much hays which are very thick and hard. My bunny doesn't eat the hard hays unless she is starving."
1,Terribly boring,"It is not an 80s gem, and It is not at all like an Indiana Jones movie.It's really quite terrible. It's slow and boring with unlikable characters. I can't think of one decent line of diologue. The Nudity is about as tittalating as being dragged into the change room with your aunt and mother when you're 5 years old, and the look of the film makes you want to go take a bath....guess I was expecting more...because some reviewer here said it was ""greatly entertaining"". It is not. That is a dirty lie...just like saying the plot of this movie was based on a true story. Sure, that people walked around a jungle and had boring conversations...maybe that part happened....."
1,Pretty Bad,"One of the posters said ""A Lost 80's Gem"". They must not have been watching the same movie that I did. To call this a ""B"" movie is an insult to ""B"" movies everywhere. The special effects were in no way special. The acting is bad, however you expect that in a ""B"" movie. Actors are generally learning their craft in this type of movie. Spoiler Alert if their can be for a movie like this. A river of diamonds, give me a break. It does have head hunters choping off heads and the obligatory priana attack(see not so special special effects). One of the actersses does manage to ""fall"" out of her very skipmy fur top frequently, however if you are expecting much in the way of nudity, skip this video. Come to think of it, just skip it. It's not worth paying the shipping charges to see this movie."
1,Not even good enough for a bad film.,"I enjoy B rated films. Hell, I even enjoy the ones that make B rated films look good. This was one of the worst films I ever sat through. A complete waste of time and money."
2,"Meh, Had so much potential!","I have not enjoyed the game so far. Granted it is outdated coming out in 2001, but this game could have been really great it would be more nice if it had more characters to choose from, more game modes but it does not. Also the dame music is constantly played over and over, thankfully i bought this game for a cheap price because it really is not worth a buy!"
1,did not fit my truck wrong part number,the computer on amazon said it fit my ranger truck it did not wrong part number on box wate a waste of time and money.
2,Too much handle,"I agree with the other comments regarding the handle being too big and heavy compared to the rest of the turner. I find it is awkward to use because of the bend in the design and thickness of the handle. It works okay for flipping burgers but not for frying eggs, the flipper portion is just too thick. I also own a couple of the matching spatulas, another disadvantage of having the thick handles is that they take up WAY too much room in the drawer. I have bought a couple of W&S red spatulas and I LOVE them, I am planning to replace all of my kitchenaid eventually."
2,Inadequate coverage of the field of Adolescent Psychology,"While the text is presented in an appealing and eye-catching fashion, the general quality of the content lacks. Ideas are covered in a rather confusing and incomplete manner. While important concepts are not stressed, Santrock provides a plethora of insignificant detail from the beginning. What initially appeared to be a promising adolescent development text turned out to be largely disappointing."
4,Good game for younger kids,"My Daughter (5 years old) loved this series on the PC, and now she can play it without me having to deal with programs written for windows 3.1. The graphics look ok, the play and story are good, the only bad thing is that it requires a reading level higher than the skill level of the play. Its fine if the player has somebody to sit there and help them.Overall...recommended."
3,Cute game but they mean it when they say 6 yrs old and up,"We bought this game for my son (he is 4 1/2)yesterday it became a family affair to try to solve the puzzles and read the captions. Needless to say most kids his age don't want to have to give up the controller to mom or dad every five minutes so he got bored pretty fast. I thought it would be fun for him, so low and behold here I am on Amazon trying to find something he will enjoy a little more. I ended up playing this after he went to bed and it took me about 1 1/2 to 2 hours to beat the game, and I realized that he wouldn't be able to complete it at his age. Cute game but they mean the 6 and up for the age suggestion."
5,The Most Perfect Season of TV Ever?,"As a huge classic TV fan, I never thought that I would say that a season of a show airing from 2005 to 2006 is the single most perfect season of a TV show ever. But I think the second season of NBC's The Office achieves that. Every single episode of this season made me both laugh hillariously and brought me to the brink of tears. They're all perfectly plotted, scripted, and especially acted. The characters are so well developed, and I can't wait to see how they grow in Season 3, which I doubt will be able to match the sheer brilliance of this season."
5,Best. Show. Ever,"""You are a gentleman, and a scholar.Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't know. Have a good day.That was a woman. She had a deep voice.""Enough said."
5,JESUS CHRIST THIS OWNS MY FACE OFF,"I'm not one to get into television comedies very much. I generally don't even watch television that much at all; however, one viewing of the office on television and I knew I had to buy these. This show is beyond all words in the English language to describe it. I suggest you buy this immediately."
4,The Office - Season Two,"Well, worth the money. You can watch this over and over and never gets tiring."
5,The Best Season and Comedy Show In The World,"This is by far the best purchase you can make. Its super funny, well acted, directed and written. I've seen at least every episode five times and the deleted scenes are just as good. There's tons of additional features. The season started awesome and ended on a cliff-hanger which makes you want to see more. Make no mistake, this is well worth it> Press Buy"
5,Surprisingly Good!,"I expected this to come in a brown generic dvd case when they said that it was not the official packaging and the disks were used, i was expecting some shaky looking boxes and disks, but they came in Office packaging, and the disks were flawless. I'm thrilled that I checked out with you guys! Thanks!"
5,Brilliant,"Absolutely brilliant. I love this show, and this DVD doesn't let a fan of ""The Office"" down!"
5,Almost painful to watch!,"What is it about this show? It's painful and hillarious at the same time!I can't believe I'm seeing or hearing things, and the next second I'm on the floor roaring with laughter!I can watch these episodes over and over.!Definately has some episodes that are NOT for younger viewers."
4,Hilarious....if you like awkwardness,"The utterly shameless Michael Scott, Regional Manager of Dunder-Mifflin Paper Company in Scranton, Pennsylvania comes into his own in season 2 of The Office. There are several moments in each episode where you feel absolutely mortified for his employees as Michael's complete lack of self-awareness comes through again and again. The characters are developed much more in this season, and you come to enjoy the personalities of everyone from the quiet and weak Toby to the domineering and socially inept Dwight. You find yourself thoroughly annoyed by Jim and Pam's refusal to express their feelings for each other. All in all, each episode is completely hilarious and if you're not careful, you'll eat away an entire Saturday afternoon watching every one of them like I did."
5,funny,highly recommended! I am now on the Steve Carrell bandwagon and look forward to seeing Get Smart.
5,America the 1337,The British version isn't even funny. How can the UK enjoy such dry humor? This one is excellent and a real hit among my college friends.
5,Too Funny,A must have for any fan. It was the lowest priced one I could find and I searched high and low. I am very happy with my purchase. It is one of the funniest shows in a long time. Worth every penny spent.
5,Office Season 2 review,"I love The Office, Season Two is great. Tons of Michael being weird and uncomfortable and Dwight being an idiot. I have all three seasons now and I can't wait for Season 4 to come out."
5,Simply fun.,"Great character development for a comedy. The only shortcoming is that the show ""cheats"" as far as being a 'mockumentary,' but the humor causes this to be easy to overlook or forgive. I don't watch that many sitcoms but the humor is more on a cinematic par with the best in modern comedies on the big screen."
5,Hysterical,"All I can say is that The Office is hands down the funniest comedy on television. Every season is funny, but I could watch season two over and over again and never stop laughing. HYSTERICAL!"
1,Don't order from this person,"I ordered this item at the beginning of March, it's not mid-April and I still haven't received anything. I tried contacting the seller, but they didn't even bother responding. I had to file a claim, and am expecting that Amazon will just cancel the order. If you want to purchase something and actually receive it, I wouldn't order from this seller. They obviously don't care at all about the people trying to purchase their items."
1,"Sorry, but my thumbs are still firmly down","I loved the UK Office. I loved the earnest characters, the drab office backdrop and the razor wit of Ricky Gervais. I also enjoy Steve Carrel, but this show has done nothing to grab me. Believe me, I have tried. I've watched all of season one and got one fourth the way through this season. The actors portray their characters so deliberately, not subtly. The jokes seem so forced. I did my best, but Gervais' Office will always be THE Office to me.Why do we Americans feel the need to remake and repackage everything popular that exists outside of our borders? If you asks me, it does not speak well of us as a nation and makes us come off as very close-minded and self-centered."
5,fast delivery and quality product,"This arrived very speedily and in excellent condition, not to mention the hilarious contents of the DVD."
5,Delicious!!!!!,"What can I say?!!! This show is such a heart warming, funny, and intelligent show that leaves you wanting more. I am counting the days for the new season to begin and the release of Season 3 on DVD. I didn't discover the series until last year and quickly got Season 1 and 2 on DVD. It is now a ritual in our house to watch a couple of episodes atleast 2-3 week.I love all the twist and turns, including all the love triangles. I for one would not stop watching if Pam finally gets her Jim!!!! Michael Scott is delicously inappropriate and Dwight ""assistant to the regional manager"" is just as wacky as you want him to be! There is never a dull moment, and you simply cannot get disappointed. I know I have worked with atleast one of the characters on the show at some point in my life. I just love this show???!!!!"
5,New Obsession,"I just got into the office barely this year, seriously about 2 weeks ago. Since I saw some of the episodes on tv I knew I had to order all the seasons. By far season 2 is the best. The dvd is great, bloopers, commentaries(I'm a nerd for that) and loads of deleted scenes. I'm glad I own it :)"
5,The Best,"This DVD was worth the price. Great value for the money spent. Since I love The Office, how could it not be good?"
5,The Office Season 2,"This is an amazing show. If you're a fan, this DVD set is perfect because it gives you so many special features that you don't get from simple network television. Buy it, or your life will suck."
5,Get it!,"Watch an episode and you'll probably want to get each season on DVD. This series is hilarious, I enjoy it as much or even more than any other comedy series I've watched. Read gut busting laughs. This is my first review and I'm only writing it because I want to support the show in some small way. Its only in its second season and many I talk to haven't seen it yet. I expect it to gain wider an wider audience and hope it is around for years to come."
4,Even Funnier the Second Time,"The Office is one of those rare television treats. A well-written, clever sitcom that depends on a great ensemble cast for its success. Steve Carrell is very funny but it is the entire cast that makes this show work. The second season is definitely worth owning- it contains all the episodes plus deleted scens for each show. There are also a number of commentaries and a gag reel. Also included are some clever spoofs opf the NBC ""The More You Know"" promos and the promos that ran during the Olympics. This is a terrific set to own and would be a great gift for any fan of good television."
5,Do you need a laugh?,"Then buy this set of DVD's. Each episode contains many extra deleted scenes that are as funny as the episodes themselves. The Office is one of the brightest comedies to come along in a long time. Doesn't everyone have a Dwight in their office, a Michael, a Jim? The show is funny because any of us that work in an office can relate in some way shape or form.This DVD is worth having because of the extra scenes, and the Office never stops being funny. JVD"
5,Nice companion CD to Merry Christmas Baby(both on Capitol),"It really is a shame that both this Capitol collection as well as Merry Christmas Baby are no longer available. I have both on cassette & they will barely survive this coming holiday season. I am anxious to find both on CD. Anyway, both feature the cream of Capitol's crop of recording stars, such as Lena Horne, Bing Crosby, Nat King Cole, Dean Martin & Peggy Lee, just to name a few. If anyone out there is able to find either Let It Snow-Cuddly Christmas Classics From Capitol OR Merry Christmas Baby-Romance And Reindeer From Capitol DO NOT HESITATE TO PURCHASE THEM-yuletide collections such as these are very hard to come by nowadays. Every song brings back memories of fun times shared with family & friends. For most baby-boomers these are songs we've all grown up with. Very highly recommended"
5,A+,"My purchase came quick and pretty much like brand new. Would do business with seller again, price was much cheaper than many others. I have seen the CD I purchased as high as $80 and I got it for $20. I recommend this seller!"
5,Wonderful!,This whimsical book was the perfect gift for my bookloving grandson. I highly recommend it!
2,Mooses Come Walking - Disappointing,"I looked at this book to purchase for my 2 year old Grandaughter. I found the contents disturbing. Moose stalking a child outside her bedroom window and the child having to pretend that she is ""dead"" so the Moose don't see her. My daughter-in-law and I discussed this book at lenghth and decided it is not a book that needs to be added to my Grandaughter's library. Perhaps the writers should study early childhood education for appropriate and inappropriate wording for preschoolers. I am sure parents can find more suitable books than this one.Signed, Disappointed in California"
3,pretty color,"Nice color but the nicole products do not seem as high quality as the regular opi and are not staying on as good, once you get past that tho it is still better than most polishes and a pretty color."
2,Where's the cranberry?,I could not taste ANY sort of cranberry taste to this tea at all...and it does not mix well. There is always residue at the bottom of the glass or the bottle. Won't buy again.
3,overall good book,We found this book a little boring but it has a nice message. It is a little long to read for a bedtime story.
3,Wasn't what I thought it was.,Thought it was a adult self help book for an adult....... Wasn't in the child section. Will keep it any way and gift it to a child.
5,a testament to old blues & hope for new folk,"Both Another Kind of Blue and Walkin' Around are exquisite testaments to Peter Keane's skill. Both are full of Keane's inspiring versions of songs from artist like Dave Van Ronk, Bob Dylan, and of course Mississippi John Hurt. Gems on Another kind of Blue include ""Call it Sleep,"" ""Another Kind of Blue"" (like the album this song was inspired by Miles Davis's masterpiece ""Kind of Blue""), ""Everything's about the Same""... and almost every other song on the CD. Keane is a fantastic interpreter, and his voice can perfectly capture both the raw emotion of old delta blues and bob dylan and a brand of smooth melodic emotion that's all his own. Keane's innovative lyrics and can be playful and subtly funny as well as absolutely heartwrenching. I have seen Peter live twice, and he is a fantastic artist. I would reccomend both his CDs to anyone."
3,Gullah Gullah Island Review:Happy Birthday Daddy,"This is an enjoyable picture book, interacting the reader and the story, and giving an inside look into African American culture. The book is centered around the concept of family which displays unity among African Americans. For example, everyone inthe family has a particular task to complete to make the party successful. The story includes traditions such as the making of presents, cake, and decorations. The illustrations don't compliment the story,are dull, have contrasting colors, anddon't portray the characters as they are on television. It seems as though the pictures are painted. The pictures try to illustrate a multi-cultural society."
5,Marvelous and impossible to pigeonhole,"I stumbled upon this disk while visiting a record store in Paris and love it. I hadn't heard of I Muvrini before and am not yet familiar with his other recordings but am an instant fan. This recording is an exotic and interesting combination of French pop motifs, mid-Eastern influences, and even, on one cut, flamenco--juxtaposed here and there with musical textures that aren't usually found together, from simple heartfelt choruses that sound like refrains from French folk chansons to haunting Celtic-flavored accents. Definitely worth checking out for those who like world music that is adventurous without being aggressive."
3,"Gamers, yes, surfers, no","The games ok, but if you're going to spend your money on a surfing game you might as well buy the better one. Ditch this game and get Kelly Slater's Pro Surfer, it's way better, you'll thank me later. The surfing physics are off on Transworld, but it does have good graphics so a gamer would probably enjoy this game but not someone who surfs. In Kelly Slater's Pro Surfer you don't have to rescue dolphins either, all you do is surf."
3,Another x sport game,"Should be another hit with skateboarder types. Average at best graphics and some decent tunes on it, but not much else going for it. No plot or story line."
1,surfs up... not,"iv'e played bad surfing games before but nothinng like this one, extremely hard and impossible to land tricks. theres about 10 hard objectives plus a competition to win to be able to play a new level. take my advice and dont get this game.... wait for kelly slaters pro surfer to come out"
3,HANG SEVEN DUDE,"addictive game play and spiffy graphics in an unfamiliar gaming environment give this game a pretty good replay value. lazy programming ( i.e.-the usual repetitive voice overs,glitchy game play and slightly awkward menu interface when your not on a wave) leaves it just short of a must have launch title. the split screen mode is not playable due to poor programming - it should be your fourth or fifth X-Box title. transworld surf 2 should prove to be a worthwhile adventure."
3,To Big and Heavy,"The spoon is a nice spoon, of good quality, however, it is way to big and heavy for everyday cooking. Most of my pans are 2 to 5 quart pans and this spoon like it's other matching items, is simply to large and heavy. They are not balanced either. I will be carefull before buying Kitchen Aid again because of this size issue."
1,Messianic CHRISTIAN Passover,This book MUST be identified as a Christian publication. It inserts Jesus into the Jewish Passover. Very offensive to Jews.
1,"Same Old Crap About Longstreet, Despite the Evidence",This would be a great reference book if not for the same tiring rethoric about Gen. Longstreet. This book was published in 2003 and references the more recent works by historians that show Longstreet was not responsible for failure of the attacks on the second and third day. Makes you wonder if the author suffers from a acute case of Lost Cause tunnel vision.
3,Almost there,"This is a nicely designed and well built weather station. However, the functionality is lacking, particularly in regards to alarms. I'd prefer that the alarms be practical as well as informative. For instance, I'd like an alarm when the outside temperature rises above (or falls below) the inside temperature. And I'd like that alarm to shut off after a specific period, rather than going on and on.Also, the moon phase function is quite limited. I couldn't be that hard to actually program the clock with the ability to display the actual time of moon rise and moon set in the timezone being used. There is ample area on the screen to display this information.So, I wouldn't buy this particular again, though I would look at La Crosse's wide selection of other devices for something better suited to my needs."
1,A weather station to avoid,I received the weather station as a gift. The system was easy to set up but the temperature probes varied a lot for each other. The screen was hard to read unless you held it at an exact angle. Documentation is very brief and not too helpful. La Crosse website was very vague about the problems and their entire trouble shooting consisted on replacing batteries. I would not recommend this product.
5,Great gift for weather lovers,"I purchased this as a gift for my dad, he loves it. Its very nice and well made. Amazon has the best price for it. It tells you everything you need to know about the weather and upcoming weather. The screen is very well made and very understandable. It is very imformative and is a great gift for those weather loving people."
4,losing a pet giraffe,A little girl learned that you can live without a stuffed Giraffe. This was my 3rd favorite angelwings book.
3,GIMME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! GIMME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! GIMME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This book shows Sister and Brother Bear making a fuss over everything they want whether it is a toy, candy, or going on a ride. Papa Bear gives in the most often to their whining wishes. Mama Bear is determined to not give in. Finally, at the end they work out a deal the cubs get one treat each time they go. Problem is that then it would be expected that every time mommy or daddy takes me to the store, I get a prize. Sometimes mommy and daddy cannot afford to get a toy and should not always have to buy one. It be better to show the cubs allowances and how to say their money. Then they can decide if they want to buy that 10 cent candy or if they want to save their money for a new bear video game or princess bearbie. One thing I do not like about these books is that they make Mama Bear look like the grownup and Papa Bear like he gives in too easily."
4,Stops those meltdowns cold!,"I would like to express my gratitude to the Berenstains for giving me the perfect antidote to my children's rampant greediness in stores. When my oldest daughter was three she began to be very demanding in stores. If I gave in I felt like a wimp and if I didn't she would disolve into tears (or worse). One day I picked up this book and it taught us both some valuable lessons. I learned to let her know beforehand if she can pick out a little something, and she learned just how unattractive tantrums look to outsiders and why it is wrong to demand everything in sight. Now if she starts to get whiney in a store I just tell her in a nice way to watch out--she's getting the gimmies, and she knows exactly what I mean. It sounds a lot kinder, too, than, ""You're a greedy brat."" I look forward to reading it to her younger sister who is just about to enter that stage!"
2,disappointing resolution,"The underlying message is one parents and kids can relate to: being tempted by all the goodies at the store. However, the way the authors dealt with this issue is disappointing. Their solution is to have the parents buy something for each child at every trip to the grocery store. Bribery, essentially.When I read this book to my daughter, we talk afterwards about why this is a really bad solution to their problem: it teaches the cubs that they should get something every time they go to the store, it DOESN'T teach the cubs to be aware that the store wants to tempt them to want stuff so their parents will spend more money, and it's completely lacking in empathy for the other parents who appear in the store with their own gimmie-afflicted cub at the end of the story.This book has value as a discussion tool about what NOT to do."
2,Every time? Honestly!,"So I usually really like the Berenstain Bears because they teach the kids good lessons but this one was not so good. The kids expect a ton of candy, toys etc. like real little kids and the parents give in. I liked this part of the book but the way they solve it is to give their kids one toy or whatever EVERY TIME they go to the store. So kids think that they need something each time they go to the store or it is ok to throw an all out tantrum. I think it is important for kids to understand that there are many times that they won't get anything and that is ok!"
4,Great Gift,"I bought one for me and one for my mom. We both love them! Enjoy the large display, accurate time and indoor/outdoor temperatures."
4,Good enough,I had a La Crosse clock before that died afer about a year. So I ordered this one to replace it. Hope I'll have better luck this time that the clock will last longer than that. Nothing to complain about the clock; it functions as expected.
4,LaCrosse clock,I enjoy knowing what the temperature is in my own backyard. If I could change one thing it would be knowing the humidity outside rather than inside. Good product!
3,Not what I expected.,Kind of cheap looking. I guess that's what you get for $20 bucks. I was hoping it was going to be too good to be true but it wasn't. Still functional just not nice enought looking to sit on my countertop.
4,Great for small spaces!,"This spice rack fits perfect in my cabinet. Yes, the lids are a little cheap feeling, but they seem to work just fine. I wish it came with labels for the lids so you could easily find the spice you are looking for, but I just went out and bought some 1"" circle silver labels to stick on the lids and they look great. Overall, they work great for me and I don't have to move 10 spices to get to the one way in the back! I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because I really think labels for the lids are necessary, and the lids themselves would be better if they were not plastic chrome plated."
4,You may be an Desi if you have one in your kitchen,"Great looking with a nice shine! These are a good solution to all ""Desi's"". As all of the other racks have bottles that have have pre-labeled spices filled in them, this one give your the ability to label and fill your own spices into it."
3,Nice rack but.....,"This is a very nice rack. Spices are easy to get to and it does not take up much space. I also looked high and low for a rack that did not include the spices and this fit the bill. The MAJOR problem is that the lids are garbage. I had to reposition two of the labels that I put on the lid and the ""chrome"" peeled off with the label. Several of the chrome lids are bubbled, which is a matter of time before the chrome peels off. Upgraded lids would make this the perfect spice rack."
1,wobbly contraption,This rack does not sit flat on the counter and wobbles. It feels flimsy and poorly constructed and I plan to return it.
4,Nice Quality,"Very nice beautiful quality of the glass, but the stand is something to be desired. The rack itself seems a little wobbly and flimsy, but the money for this is worth the glass bottle. However, I sadly already dropped and broke one. Can't wait to fill all of the bottles up with spices!"
2,Poor seals,"Generally speaking the design is a good idea. Too bad the bottles don't seal well. The lids are poorly maufactured/designed and do not seal properly. As a test, I put water in one of the bottles and put the lid on nice and tight then turned the bottle on it side and watched the water run out. This is not good for spices as they will not keep well if the container is not sealed."
5,Fantastic space saver,"I bought two of these racks and I love them - I had previously stored my herbs and spices on one of those tiered shelving units/racks, and invariably I'd knock over an entire row when I would attempt, however gingerly, to sort through the jars and retrieve one from the back row. This spice rack is a great space saver, and it's attractive enough to leave out on the counter. Most importantly, I can find what I'm looking for at a glance. I enjoy an organized life, but now, even my spice jars are alphabetized!Another reviewed mentioned that the jars are small. I don't find this to be a problem, as the jars are ample enough to store quantities that I would go through in a reasonable period time. Herbs and spices tend to lose their pungency over time, so stockpiling isn't advisable.Beauty and function - 5 stars."
1,Very Disappointing!,"This item is not advertised accurately. The description should tell you that the lids are plastic with a thin chrome-color coating. Even though the lids were covered with plastic to protect them when shipped, they arrived scratched. They are cheap-looking and cheaply made. If they were chrome lids, they wouldn't have scratched so easily, if at all. While the rest of the spice rack looks great, the lids are what you notice and they make the whole product look bad. I wanted an attractive spice rack to sit on my counter, but I don't even want this hiding in the cabinet. Very disappointing!"
2,Great Idea...Poorly Executed,"Just got this set and was excited to get my spices into them. The rack is compact and fits my city apartment wonderfully. It's exactly what I was looking for. But...and it's a big one...the lids on these things are useless. The shaker lids have holes way too small for any of your spices that aren't granulated to fit through. Some other reviewers have mentioned that McCormick spices lids fit and that's true, but McCormick no longer uses those lids and have switched over to lids integrated into the cap. I only have one in my collection that I can re-purpose. The screw on lids and chrome plated plastic, not great but fine for the price, and the screw tops aren't anywhere close to airtight. This combined with the clear glass means your spices will quickly be degraded due to both light and air.Sad to say these are going back and I'll have to keep shopping."
4,"Handy, Small-Footprint Spice Rack","This spice rack is handy for a small kitchen, takes up very little counter or cabinet space. It is extra easy to locate spices on it, and to pull them and replace them, facilitating a grab and sprinkle cooking style.I gave it four instead of five stars, because I find the spice jars just a little too small. I also wish the curved slots were big enough to hold Trader Joe's spice jars. I'm glad I bought it, because it sure beats the crowded random bottles-on-the-lazy-susan system we had before."
1,Clara's Heart,"I couldn't watch it, because it wouldn't load. It kept saying it was a bad disc. And seeing how it was in German anyway I sent it back on Oct. 15, 2009 & you received & signed for it on Oct. 17, 2009. I've requested several times for the money to put back into my zccount. If the money isn't returned within the next 48 hours I'll be contacting the BBB & will not be doing business with you again!!!!!!!!!!"
4,"Interisting, but could have been better","Most of this book was well written except for the ending. It should have been a little more detailed or maybe extended. Niles is one of my favorite authors and has written many good books , but he could have done better."
3,The Last Thane,"The forces of Chaos are launching a full-scale attack on the Dwarven peoples of the Dragonlance world. So right away you know the focus of this novel is the plight of the Dwarves in their underground lair. Like most novels in the Dragonlance world of TSR, there are plenty of surprises and a fair number of thrills, and Douglas Niles is one of my favorite Dragonlance authors. Still, the entire experience seems rather dry. It is definitely not memorable, nor are the characters. None the less, it's a decent fantasy yarn set in the Dragonlance world which focuses solely on the Dwarves."
4,A great dwarf tale of Thorbardin,"I have never been a maniac about the dwarven realm of Thorbardin, but this book opened up my eyes. I must admit the introduction of daemon warriors and the platinum egg inticed me into further reading the story. Other than Weis and Hickman, Douglas Niles is one of my favorite DragonLance authors."
3,DL fan? Read it. Not a Dl fan? Don't read it.,"This book was a great disappointment. Does anyone remember the days in the the first dl novels when there weren't 6 dwarven races? As in the five races plus the gully dwarves. Tarn was referred to as a half-breed constantly. Why? He is a dwarf. This books story line had huge potential but didn't deliver. If You are a DL fan then read this book, otherwise don't. I was really disapointed. The whole book built up to a be about a platinum egg, I was expectcting some special platinum dragon to come out and then it turns out that the loser acting thane of the hylar puts his hands on the egg and turns into light and kills all the chaos army in thorbardin. All the while he purified the good dwarves. Crap. A storyline with huge potential was ruined by an incompatent author."
3,Cumbersome,"While remodeling my kitchen, I decided I HAD to have cobalt utensils to match my small Kitchenaid appliances. With the exception of this slotted turner, I'm glad I got them. Unfortunately, this turner is too large for easy flipping in my pans, and due to the handle being too flexible, I don't feel like I have good control when using it. The business end of the turner is rather thick, and so doesn't ""slip under"" the food as readily as my other turners. Love the Kitchenaid's other silicone utensils, but have to rate this turner just 3 stars."
1,Ultra-flexible turner,"This turner was much too ""soft"" for my taste; the neck is bendable to the point that it makes it difficult to use. I have several other Kitchenaid products which I really like, but this one is going to be replaced soon."
1,Poorly designed,"I didn't buy this from Amazon.com, but I can't resist writing a review nonetheless. The handle is so heavy that it flips the turner out of the pan unless you have it in the pan up to the handle, and the handle doesn't take the heat well. Today, the thing flipped out of the pan onto the floor, and it broke in half where the turner meets the handle. Someone designed this tool with good silicone, nice appearance, but serious problems with functionality. Wish I could get my money back."
2,"Too big, too thick, too bulky","This turner LOOKS impressive, but that's all I can find favorable about it. It's too thick to slide under food, too rough to let food on it slide off, and too bulky to store in the crock with the rest of the turner utensils. Meal after meal, I grab the old, ugly, scorched turners instead of this. When this is the last clean turner in the kitchen, I handwash a dirty one. I'd throw it away...but it was a present."
3,Not the greatest...,"...but it's okay. I like it because it is soft silicone so when I drop it it does not damage. It is a little too flexible, but it's weighted much better than the other spatula (the non-slotted one). All in all it's a pretty sturdy, workable item. Great for pancakes."
2,THE MOTHER OF ALL DISSAPOINTMENT,"this game is a bummer.i just finished hitman II silant assasin great game,so many things your guy can do.lots of gadgets and tricks,great balance of violence and strategy,well thought out.max payne is none of that.it should be a ps1 game.dont buy it,rent first."
3,Blink and the games done,"Graphics for the game were awesome and the storyline was great but the game didn't take very long to finish, it only has three chapters to the game and that is why it was traded as soon as I finished it, I was very disappointed with the end too! Save your money and just rent it!!!!!"
5,Rockstar did it again!!!,This is one of the best shooters there are. It has a awsome story line. The graphics are good but not the best. Actually max's hand is always in the position if he was holding a gun even when he isn't. The weapons are awsome. It is hard to choose whitch weapon i would like to use next. There are two flaws in the game. One is that the game has no multiplayer. The other is the game isn't that long but is very fun. I have beaten this game 3 times and i'm still enjoying it. The blood and gore is also very realistic. I like that for shooters because it makes the game more realistic and fun. The Matrix mode in the game is probably one of the bigest reasons why i like it. You can dive in mid air while in slow mode in any direction and waste the enemy. I recomend buying this game even though the story is short and there is no multiplayer it is still a great game.
5,This game Rules!,"this has to be the best PC game I ever played. I mean WOW! If you are to get a PC game , this is the one. I cant wait for part 2."
3,Fun while it lasts...,"Let's say I was expecting much more from a game like this. I must agree that the graphics and sound are good, same applies to the 'bullet time' thing, but it doesn't give you a lot of continuous game play... Levels take a while to load, and during the game, you constantly have to stop and wait for the storyline to load, read and listen, not to mention the animation clips, which you cant skip at all... So these are my conclusions:Highs:- Realistic gameplay- Realistic graphics- Nice weapon arsenal- Very twisted storyline, be aware of the `M' in the boxLows:- Levels take a while to load- You can only save at the beginning of a level- Gameplay is basically the same thorough all levels, only different scenarios- Can't customize controller buttons- You will finish the game pretty quick...Verdict:You'll have fun while you play, but there is no replay value... I highly recommend previewing the game before buying it. Fun factor (2/5)"
3,Max Payne,"My favorite part of this game is when u get to drive the golf cart. The most fun you can have is on the 7th green near the water, left of the sand trap. PUTTING!! The second best part of the game, the driving range, is very violent. I did not appreciate the realisticness of the blood and gore. It could have been a better game had there been no drive-by slayings, or Titleist putters! I recommend this game to all young kids under 17, and everyone over 56."
3,max payne,"The game is pretty cool. The story is great, keeping thing moving and having you want to see what happens next. Pretty good graphics, although they are grainy. The controls suck. I played the whole game through and was never able to work them smoothly and control customizations are very limited. I found myself switching between configurations for different situations.I did start to get tired with it about 3/4 of the way through and was ready for it to end, but the story kept me coming back. If you are content just shooting people then this may be for you. But there are virtually no puzzles and the game is extremely linear. You go from point A to point B and never have really have to find your way. Great story, some fun and no brains needed."
3,Lots of Fun........... Once,"I bought this game after playing the PC version at a friends house. The slow-mo, ""bullet-time"" gameplay looked and played really well, but it felt like it was simply there to keep players from getting bored of the repetitive gameplay.Every level is essentially the same, and the game plays the same way throughout. The story kept me interested, but after one run through this game simply wasn't worth the effort a second time, even with the number of playable difficulties it offers. Rent it instead."
3,Game Noir,"I really, really wanted to like this game (especially with it's new price tag), but often found myself facing a sense of deja vu level after level after level. All the characters looked pretty much alike (aside from the the ones wearing skirts) and all I seemed to do was shoot (no puzzles to solve here as the game plows forward as you kill off bad guys). Max Payne is a pretty straight-forward shoot-em-up game that only offers the unique ""Bullet Time"" to enhance game play (which I often just found to be too distracting to ever use). Filled with a good amount of violence and a decent story line and some okay graphics, Max Payne wasn't a complete waste as it offer a few twists while you discover who has framed Max for a serious of brutal murders. However, the ending was a little lack-luster and made me wonder if they'd ever produce a sequel (considering that the game has been around for a few years for the PC)."
3,"I highly suggest a rental, or borrow it first.","Max Payne was one of my favorite games last year, but now the thrills of the game just didn't last that long.Pros:Nice aresonel of weaponsBullet time really helpsA port of a superb PC gameGo through a good story full or twistsFun while it lastsCons:Long loading timesgraphics not as good as Xbox or PCs versionafter beating it, there's little thrills to play it againNo extrascan't skip boring moviesNo shadows at allThe game gets repetitive as wellKillin level after level sure gets boringIf you brought it, sooner or later you're gonna wish u rented itThe voice acting is ugly, and horableThe game was addictive at first, and I ended up trading state of emergency, one of the wackest games ever 4 dis. Well this is better than it, but the loading times are what [make me mad] the most, cuz when I die, I have to sit throught the loading times again and again. Like I said, rent or borrow B4 u buy."
5,"Th best there is, the best there was,the best there will be",This game is da bomb and everything about it is right. The graphics are superb and the bullet time rocks. Anyone wh disagrees needs to think again.
3,ok,i received it at time but it'i not the thing i bought who suppose to arrive 28 december and magical it's not arrive yet.
3,Max Payne = Migraine,"I was very excited when buying this game but once I put it in andsarted playing, I allmost in ah instint, started to burst out intears. Seriously, it's that disapointing, (...) The graphics are terrible, the sound is fitting, the story lineis gripping, the cinema is gawd awful but I still play it, only out ofspite do I play this horrible, just terrible game..."
2,"Best shooter ever, but for Ps2?","I have the Ps2 and love it, graphics are great and games are fun. Max Payne, however, is the greates shooter ever and is amazing in every way. The graphics require more than the Ps2 so they will have to downsize the graphics. I wouldn't buy it for the Xbox either. The graphics are a little bit better but not much. Ps2 and Xbox wouldn't be worth the money. Buy it for PC, then you can fully enjoy it!"
1,Why did they make it for the PS2?,"Why buy this on the PS2. It looks horrible on the PS2. It looks so much better on the PC or wait for it to come out on the XBOX. The game itself rules and deserves game of the year honors, but whatever you do don't buy on the POS2."
2,Not very fun at all...,"This game is pretty bad. The graphics look like something from an early Playstation (v.1) game, the controls are awkward, the acting is horrible, the storyline is boring, and it tries milking that cheezy Matrix style slow-mo effect for all its worth. Even if you do happen to enjoy playing the game, the gameplay is interrupted every couple of minutes for a new ""chapter"" and more bad story to unfold."
4,Great Game!,"The Good:Lots Of Shooting,Great Missions,Loads Of FunThe Bad:ControlsGraphicsScary,Scary,ScaryThis is a great game. I have all the cheats so I have all the levels right from the start.I play all sorts of them.It's a very freaky starting in Maxes House. Overall its a very good game and I would recommend it to people 13 and over. If you get the cheat of unlimited health then you survive the whole game without dying. Slow Motion Rocks its so awsome. Rockstar games make a sequal and a Movie would be nice to!"
2,Should have been alot better,"I had high hopes on this game but I was disapointed. The controls are horrible and definately the voice acting throughout 90% was bad. The story line was basically typical, it really didn't hold my interest for long. I did beat the game because I spent $50 on it the day it came out and I figured I would at least do that. I gave the game to a friend of mine after I beat it and he had the same opinion as I did. It's worth renting but definately not worth buying. Hopefully those who decide to buy or rent this game can devote a good bit of time trying to learn the controls."
5,Cult Classic,"The original Max Payne was great.Unfortunatly,I can't say the same about the other two.The storyline in this game was fantastic.It also had a really cool creepy,eerie thriller-type of theme to it.The graphics were great.Especially for an older game.The characters look almost like real people for crying out loud! Just check out the textures and the facial features on Max and the rest of the characters,during gameplay.Hell.Even the storyboards look real.The music is also very good.Overall,Max Payne is a great action/thriller title,and I highly recommend it."
5,Max Payne brings the pain for real in this game!!!,Max payne absolutely rocks! every time i tell myself im ready for a break i just keep on playing. The graphics are pretty good especially for 2001 and bullet times makes you feel like your right in the action. so if your looking for a great action game i suggest Max Payne
4,The original is hard to beat,"Max Payne is a very entertaining, dark-themed action shooter. The PS2 version has some occasional slowdown but these bits do not take much away from the overall experience. Also the loading screens are frequent and fairly long. Plenty of violence and exciting gameplay elements make this game an obvious choice for shooter or action game fans and should be a permanent addition to a mature PS2 library."
5,max payne,max payne is a third person shooter that's a lot of fun the games best feature it the bullet time that allow player to slow down time i would recommend this game very fun and great story
3,My Thoughts On Max Payne,"I rate this game very awsome.The first time i played it took meawile to figure it out , but now i play like a pro.If your thinking about buying it,your right it is awsome!!"
3,ok,"this game is ok; if you're into just running around and shooting people. but after playing for about fifteen minutes, i got really sick of it (literally). the controls are hard to get used to, and the gameplay gets me really dizzy. i do like the matrix like slow motion(bullet time) feature. i no longer own this game 'cause i sold to a friend after just one day."
2,A real ANNOYING GAME,"if you want to get a decent game, get metal gear solid or medal of honor. this game is a terrible one, controls are horrible. I didnt read the review above because there is nothing about this game to talk about in so much paragraphs. A WASTE OF MONEY AND TIME!!!"
3,"Good graphics and storyline, but:","...the controls! Please! This would've been a very, very good game, if it wasn't for the [bad] controls...I'm sorry, I like the game, but the controls make the game (for me) virtually unplayable."
3,Pump your fists for Valhalla...,"I like this game because 1) I love The Matrix (bullet time) and 2) you get to murder and slaughter. Now, with that being established, I'd say the rest of the game is pretty bland. The control for one is confusing especially on the screaming baby head levels.The story isn't anything new, it's the same one from The Punisher, but the character Max makes it a little more interesting. The weapons really add a nice touch because the Jackhammer is one vicious piece of machinery.Rent this one first, it's not so hard to beat so it'll save you all a few dollars stolen from your granny's purse after the big win at bingo. Actually, don't rent it, ask someone you know if you can borrow it like I did. With the [money] it costs to rent you could go to the movies and watch Blade II or get a double whopper value meal. Your choice."
3,doesn't quite deliver,"Rockstar, best known for the hit game Grand Theft Auto 3, makes a lot of violent games. Max Payne is more of the same type of stuff...crooked cops, sawed-off shotguns, solid graphics, huge levels, etc. Overall the game is pretty good, but there are some faults that should have been corrected.The voice acting is absolutely horrible--talk about scary...how did this ever make it into the final version of the game? Kinda wrecks the whole thing if you ask me. The action is good, lots of blood, but next time leave out the slow-mo."
2,Save your $$ Don't Buy It,"Let me start by saying that I rented this title rather than paying [the money] to buy it and I believe I made the right choice. Max payne is a very frustrating game that gives gamers a headache. Average graphics, average gameplay and horrible control. Game play becomes a very challenging task since one analog stick is for moving and the other is for aiming. Put it this way, for the hours that I spent playing this title I could never grasp the controls perfectly. Overall I recommend renting first to see if you like it."
3,"Good,but short",This is a reslly short game. I went and bought it and beat it within 2 days and like 8 hours total of gameplay.Graphics can use some help but overall its an ok game
3,Maximumly Payneful Review,This game leaves alot out. The Storyline is way to discrete in the wordage. They use things that sound like they are right out of a 60's movie. It is just another gangster kill all leave no survivors game. Max Payne is an okay game but it doesn't hold my attention very well
5,A classic in action gaming...,"This incredible game is one of the best in the action genre, setting a new standard in action gaming. The characters are complex, the violence dark, and the story involved and constantly engaging. You are Max Payne, fugitive cop out to bring down the baddies of the big city. Now, you've launched a one-man war after you lose everything you know and love. The graphics in this game are pretty good, but it is the story that keeps this game constantly interesting and fun to play for hours on end. It takes a while to get used to the controls, but once you can handle it, the fun never stops!"
3,"The PS2 might sell more, but its limitations hurt this version of Max Payne.","While the PS2 version is not really bad, it is horrible next to the near perfect versions on the Xbox and PC. The PS2's sound and music to Max Payne is uneven and really scatchy when the narrative scenes are on. The gameplay is still good, even though some areas are cut off do to the PS2's limitations but that doesn't hurt the gameplay too much.Graphics are also very scratchy, and so are the characters, even though all the versions of Max Payne don't have great character models, the PS2 version looks even more out of order.But the controls are better for PS2, the smaller controller the PS2 has really helps compared the Xbox controller and a keyboard.Still highly enjoyable, the game is still an intense action game with a lot of violence. If you can't get your hands on any other version, then the PS2 is perfect for you."
3,Fun Third Person Shooter but...,"I doubt it if I would play it again at least once a month like my other games that I have. Yes, I agree with the editorial review on this game but I would like to add that there are two levels that you have to play/endure as a involuntary drugged-induced Max Payne running and jumping through this blood-trail maze. What really sucks is that if you step off the path you have to keep repeating the level until you make it through. This is SO STUPID! I don't know why the programmers didn't just make these into cutscenes."
4,me likey,over all a pretty good game that you just want to keep going and going and it dose but it never long enough i guess. my favorite thing about this game(and this is strange)is the cut scenes.no game has good cut scenes the acting (is bad) the people look wierd if there lips even move and ive seen enough of that ... when i was a kid watching my younger sister do barbie shows.but anyway the cut scenes are great because there done with real picures of real people in comic book style witch i think is a great idea.there are alot of other cool things about this game but i think thats where max really stands out
4,Max fun,Imagine the matrix with more action.There is also a lot more violence. The bullet time feature is a must have in other games. Great graphics . Very realistic sounds . A must have for action gamers.
3,"good action, bad controls","This is one of the best action games i have ever played. The visual effects were great, slow motion action/Matrix type video games make it more like a real movie and you are the director. i would enjoy this game a lot more if there were different control options, using both sticks is kinda difficult when you have to shoot people at the same time. i have not yet gotten used to the controls, maybe if i do then it will be more fun. if you like action this is the game for u"
3,Max Payne Painful Game,"Max Payne for the Playstation 2 is not worth the [money]. The graphics and sound are amazing, but the gameplay is frustratingly choppy and not very responsive. When three or four gangsters are shooting at you, the frame rate becomes extremely slow and it becomes impossible to aim your weapon correctly. I rented it, found the cheat codes, and beat it in eleven hours total. The game is IMPOSSIBLE to play on the PS2, because the PS2 cannot handle the smooth frame rate that is required. If you have a decent PC, I suggest you buy it for that particular platform. It was a fun 11 hours, though. For a good PS2 first-person shooter, try Red Faction or Half Life."
1,"Great Visuals, Distracting and Irritating Play Control","This game is gorgeous, and the perspective is unique and fantastic. Unfortunately, some controls do not translate as well from computer mouse (or gamepad) to PS2 as they could.I had such high hopes for this game, but I am just not able to use both analog joysticks, the L1/2 and R1/2 buttons, and the button pad at the same time. Call me uncoordinated (despite the fact that I have been playing video games since before there were home video game systems!), but I don't want to give myself carpal tunnel syndrome from playing a game!I would also like to state that ""bullet-time"" was a neat style of visual effect in the Matrix. It is not something I want to see in shooting games in the future, as it just adds a level of implausibility to an otherwise realistic game."
1,The Has the Two B'S,"It is a game that has the 2 B's. B- Extrememly Bloody and Gorey, and extremely Boring. It has very, very violent scenes terrible for little kids, like my brothers. It also contains some pretty harsh, cussin' too. The M rating for it is perfect.."
1,sucks sucks,this game is just a waste of time everything about this crap game gave me a huge headache think god for advil they said that it took then a long time to make this game and for what its not worth nothing cameras are very bad it makes you dizzy when you play it there also a part in this game were you have to follow a maze in pich dark all you see is the lines from the maze you fall off almost every time plus that baby crying too just does it help you. like I said just a waste of time. plus max payne looks fuuny in this game take a good look at his face it looks like he from resident evil the walking dead. and they said it took then a long time to make this game. this game should have never been release.
1,sucks sucks,this game is really bad I mean everything about it. they took so long to make this and for what.its just a waste off time and your money I gave it 1star because the guns are the best thing about this crap game
1,Have put it to a different use,"I was looking for a bargain and was thrilled to find this T-shirt, priced similarly to the cotton T-shirts I get from Marks & Spencer's in the UK. However, I was disappointed to find that the material is thin and loosely woven, and the T-shirt badly sewn together. Not a bargain, after all, just cheap stuff, in quality as in price. I suppose it was unwise to have risked buying something at this price online, where you cannot examine the article before deciding whether it is worth it or not... Too bad: will be used as a rag to clean the furniture!"
5,V-Neck Tee,Excellent customer service. Shirt came really quickly. Very happy with my purchase. I recommend others to purchase from this company.
1,Sloppy work,This t shirt is not as advertised and the workmanship is sloppy. I will never buy another item from this company.
4,if you like Elliott Smith. . .,. .. you will like Peter Salett. I heard the title track in a movie and bought this CD - it is sort of folky and melancholy and the lyrics are wonderful and non-cliched. The title song is the best track on the album.
5,A total Eclipse of the Jazz Mind,"LISTEN: I don't care what you were listening to in the past or what your enjoying now. This ALBUM is a sure WINNER. When is the last time you picked up a Jazz album with a lot of funk and every cut on the album is good to go? HERE IT IS BABY! This is one of those albums that when you listen to it years down the line, It still sound good. JUST GET IT."
1,headphones do not stay in place,"The headphones would not remain in place. After constatnly adjusting them, I realized they were going to keep stretching and simply would not be worth using."
2,Almost worthless (almost),"The original movies have all been available before. One of them is the rancid 1968 film without Peter Sellers. Two of them are poorly assembled clipfests from the other movies. Another is a rotten 1993 spinoff. Yet another is the atrocious Steve Martin remake.And then the set is filled out with tons of cartoons. The original theatrical stuff has some flair, but the TV cartoons are big stink bombs.And of course (while MGM couldn't help it because of rights issues) Return of the Pink Panther isn't here at all.Feel like shelling out a bunch of money for this yet?The only thing of interest at all in this set is the original movie with ""over 60 minutes of never-before-seen footage."" 60 minutes of Peter Sellers outtakes? That's worth lining up for! Hopefully it will be available on its own at some point."
5,JR review,I had a problem with the first collection and I sent it back and exchanged it. This was done in a very timely manner.Great job and service.
1,"Another flawed ""Collection""","Peter Sellers, Herbert Lom and the rest are hilarious in all of the Pink Panther movies!Too bad this is just another failed release of a Pink Panther ""collection""! ""The Return of the Pink Panther"" from 1975 is still missing, just like it was in the 2004 Pink Panther ""Collector's Edition"".Why bother to release another flawed collection? Just another example of irrational corporate greed..."
5,Excellent Service,"Seller delivered item as promised, and fast. Item was better than I thought it would be. Oh, and this item is really big and heavy. The pictures don't really convey how big it is. Great seller, will buy from again."
1,Poor packaging wrecks this collection,"When Amazon had the deal of the day on this set, I couldn't have been more excited to get it. However, the first set was delivered with a broken corner of the collector's fuzzy box. Inside the box, many of the DVDs had fallen out of their slots, and were severely scratched. I contacted Amazon customer service, which is excellent by the way, and they next day delivered a replacement and paid for me to UPS the original back.The second collection arrived with a different corner of the collector's box smashed, and more loose, scratched DVDs. I don't see how this can be avoided, as the poor packaging will never deliver a perfect or even very good collection to your home.I am going to give up, and return the second set for a refund. What good is a ultimate collection in a broken box, with scratched DVDs. It will never hold it's resale value in this damaged condition."
4,Perfect size for travel,"I bought this for an upcoming trip to South America. It seems like it will serve its purpose, size is just right. But since I don't know any Spanish, I'm not sure about accuracy although the choices of words and phrases seems appropriate."
3,Keep this one away from the kiddies!,"I thought this was basically alright. We liked DK much better, and found ourselves using it a lot more. DK was better at grammar and pronunciation as well. The layout was good and easy to follow (Lonely Planet). However, a word of caution,there is a whole social section of phrases that you will want to keep away from the kids! This is clearly an adults only phrase book!"
5,Superb,"A wonderful book to use as a Read Aloud to teach the concept/meaning of ""fortunately"" and ""unfortunately"". Lovely colorful illustrations, a fun twist at the end that kids will love. A lively, clever picture book, a must have for every elementary library in my opinion."
5,One of my best dates involved this book,"If all the 5 star reviews aren't enough, here's how this book touches children's lives: I was driving with a guy and had bought this for my friend's kid. He went ballistic with excitement when he saw it in the car, about how he'd had it as a child, and proceeded to read the book as we drove.The kid I bought it for loved it almost as much, and perhaps he will look back in 40 years with the same excitement.It's a classic and a nice way to get the message of looking at the brighter side of things to a kid."
5,Fortunately,"FortunatelyI remembered how much my daughter enjoyed this book when she was young and ordered it for my grandson, who is 4 years and 5 months old. It arrived by mail yesterday and she sent me an e-mail today saying that my grandson absolutely loves the Fortunately book!! They read it four times the day it arrived and then her husband read it to him at bedtime. He is making up his own jokes about things being fortunate/unfortunate and has the story partly memorized in one day! This book is educational and great fun as well."
5,Timeless book,"My teacher read us this book when I was in kindergarten. I recently bought it for my 5 year old son and he loves it because it is so funny. It is also short, so I don't mind reading it to him before bedtime."
4,very happy to see this book reprinted,this is one of the books that i remember reading as a child. so now i am happy to be able to share it with my own child.
4,Kinder resource,This book is great for demonstrating how problem solving is not about right and wrong but coming up with ideas. As the text is limited it can be enjoyed by both three and four year olds.
3,Fortunately?,"The book has very nice illustrations, lots of color, imaginative. The illustration on the cover is of a young child .. actually leading me to believe the book was intended for young children. But I think young children would find it a bit scary .. being in an exploding plane, 'finding' a parachute.. with a hole in it, falling into a haystack.. with a pitchfork, and so on and on. I just couldn't connect with anything in this book."
3,DVDs far better than the books it was based on,"I liked these DVDs far better than the books it were based on, which I could get no handle on whatsoever."
5,Nice packaging,"As advertised, this was an unopened, shrink-wrapped DVD that had not previously been viewed. It arrived in a timely manner. I have not opened it yet but I am sure I will enjoy this series when I view it in Mexico, being an Angie Harmon fan!"
1,Disapppointed in Amazon,"I ordered this product and paid extra for Dec.24th delivery. When I tracked this package turns out it was delivered to the wrong UPS facility, one located less than 45 minutes from my house. So instead of sending the package on Christmas Eve, as was scheduled, they decided to hold the package until the next business day, Dec. 26th. How incredibly DISAPPOINTING.!! They actually told me even though I paid for guaranteed delivery on Dec.24th, it actually means a guarantee of 2 business days. ARE YOU KIDDING ME. Needless to say, this was a gift for my mother that did not make its way under the tree. This is one of the first times I can truly say I am disappointed in Amazon's performance. I did not get what I paid for."
5,"Great show, Great collection!!","I really love this show. I got the first season as a birthday gift. I have watched it over and over again. The deleted scenes and bloopers are awesome. I can't wait for the second season to be released. Love it, love it, love it!!!"
4,"Enjoyable, Exciting ... Loved It!",I had watched a few of the first episodes when it first started but I had other shows that I had been enjoying that were being shown at the same time. Getting the first year on DVD I decided would be the best way to see if Rizzoli & Isles and my first impression would be as enjoyable and exciting I hoped the series would be. I will now try to watch them during season two as it is a great series. Love the interaction between the two. Definitely will be picking up the seasons' DVD also. Keep up the good work!
5,Wonderful Series,"I watched this series for the first time on a flight from Los Angeles to New York. It is fast-paced, witty and keeps you guessing. I can't wait for the 1st season DVD to be issued."
4,Love this show!,"This show is amazing and the prices were better than on eBay. Unfortunately this season came with a loose disc which kind of got scratched a little but it worked so I didn't bother returning it. Other than that, I got a great buy for both seasons."
3,Another cop series,"Because I have read quite a few of Tess Gerritsen books involving these two characters, the series becomes just another cop series as the characters are only based very loosely around the characters of the book, I found it a little disappointing. But I do like the type of series, where it involves alot of forensic and crime solving, so it was watchable, and gave me some enjoyment."
5,rizzli & iles,great DVD unable to see the program because we don't have cable and friends told me how great the series is so we are very happy.
5,Love these gals!!,"I have always enjoyed the writing and the acting of this series. I missed some out of their 1st season, so these DVDs in one packet is awesome, and played through our Sony BLURAY unto our HD 52"" TV, it is wonderful all over again, watching these two ladies do their ""thing""."
5,Love it! Can't wait to Season 2.,"Another new cop show but one with 2 ballsy ladies in the lead.The writers have done a good job with the two lead characters, establishing good depth and vulnerability to them both. Angie Harmon and Sasha Alexander's chemistry develops over the course of the season, You could almost describe them as sisters: both have enormous respect for each other, whilst taking the mickey out of each other (esp Harmon) and having genuine love and concern. Yes, Isles has similarities to Bones but I think she has a softness that perhaps Bones doesn't which has made it easier to develop empathy for her.The stories are good but perhaps gets resolved too quickly in certain episodes. The fact there is a continuing bad guy that haunts Rizzoli is good and hope he continues in Season 2.If you like Angie Harmon, you'll really like this show - her character is far more rounded that in her Law & Order days.Thoroughly enjoyable - can't wait for Season 2."
5,Seriously good!,Both of these girls are hilarious and have really great chemistry as friends. You can see them working together and being friends despite the odd ball pairing. The comedy is pure genius. The characters are relatable and you can't help but laugh/giggle/cry when you watch this. You won't know how hooked you are until you're halfway in! Seriously worth the buy!
2,buddy cop/coroner cliches galore,"My wife and I purchased the first season from Itunes and was sorry we did. We are fans of both Angie Harmon and especially Sasha Alexander but they both feel terribly mis-cast in this series; the chemistry between Sasha and Angie feels forced. Rizzoli's parents seem equally if not more mis-cast, and I would cringed every time they had parts in an episode. The actual cases that Rizzoli and Isles have to solve seemed very generic (cue the mandatory serial killer that fixates on the main character). We had great hopes for the this show but characters where not interesting enough to keep us watching the generic plots. I give the series two stars instead of only one, because at least it isn't reality TV."
4,"Sasha Andersen, what a darling, makes the show!!!","Rizzoli and Isles comes second to The Closer, a 2 hour treat for TV mysteries. Where has Sasha Andersen been hiding all these years? Sasha and Harmon make a great pair."
2,Don`t buy this....,"some decent crime stories, average actors (at best)....would have been an ok review untilthe final episode with kindergarden writing: Police headquatersis easily taken over, because every body gone at a crime scene, cell phonessuddenly disappeared ?? so rizzoli and isles can`t call for help.ending with incredibly simple-minded cliffhanger.....Who in the world writes these things?"
2,Not happy...,"I love Rizzoli & Isle Series but I buy the Season 1 used and the disc #2 came broke and I lost the address to return it. It's not the first time that I buy something used in Amazon, but it's the first time in years that I am not satisfied, not with Amazon, but this product especifically."
5,Great Series,"I first saw Season Two on TNT, which I enjoyed. It is a great mixture of a tough cop and knowledgeable doc. These two ladies, their family and their male sidekicks make a great story. Since there are several ""medical-person-turned-crime-solver"" series today, this one has an edge to it that is very good. It was great to see what I had missed in Season One with this DVD set. The quality of the picture and sound are clear. If you enjoy watching a good police mystery with interesting characters, this series is for you."
5,Really good show and actors.,This is the one show on tv that I try not to miss. I enjoy the humor and the interaction between the characters.
5,Review,I ordered this product at the same time I ordered the second season of the same series. They arrived together and on time. I would highly recommend this supplier.
2,Disappointed,"This DVD lacks many details on the dynamics and intricacies of the Austin swing. It gives a very high level overview of the Mike Austin swing and if you learn from watching Mike Dunaway hit balls, this is the DVD for you. Watching his movements directly contradicts some of the other Mike Austin books/DVDs that I have. Leaves me wondering who is right and what exactly Mike Austin's method is."
3,Started off good.........,"If you like the X-Files, you will probably like this book! When I first started reading it, I could not put it down! It was purely movie material, however, towards the end I found it to be sort of a let down. A good plot but the end was lame. Everything wrapped up in 2 chapters. They spent alot of time building characters you could visualize and then just ended it. I also think they should have referred more to the abductions of the main character when she was younger. It would have made the ending more dramatic. Kudos to the weapon development though. I would recommend reading it but create your own ending."
4,"An excellent overview of area 51 lore, a real page turner.","A novelized version of what conspiracy theorists have long said about the goings on at Area 51. Its a well thought out, dramatic story. The authors did their research on the subject and it shows. It's a bit in the style of Whitley Strieber's ""Majestic""."
3,A WORTHY BIO OF JEFFERSON DAVIS,"rHE AUTHOR WILLIAM C. DAVIS HAS WRITTEN MANY BOOKS ON THE CIVIL WAR AND THIS PERIOD OF OUR HISTORY. FOR A LONG TIME HE WAS EDITOR OF THE MAGAZINE CIVIL WAR ILLUSTRATED. SOME OF HIS BOOKS BELONG MORE IN THIS MAGAZINE THAN IN BOOK FORM. THISIS ONE OF HIS BEST, COMPARABLE TO HIS FINE WORK ON BRECKENRIDGE AND LIKE THAT EARLIER BOOK THIS OFFERS US A GOOD READ ABOUT THE POLITICS OF THE TIME BOTH NORTH AND SOUTH. IT IS A GOOD READ IN THE SENSE THAT THEE AUTHOR HAS GIVEN A GREAT DEAL OF TIME TO RESEARCH AND THINKING ON HIS SUBJECT. HOWEVER, IT IS NOT AS WELL WRITTEN AS SOME OTHER BIOS OF JEFF DAVIS.WM. DAVIS ATTEMPS TO BE FAIR IN HIS ASSESSMENT OF DAVIS, NEITHER PRO NOR CON TO A GREAT EXTENT AND THIS SEEKING FOR FAIRNESS TAKES SOME OF THE EXCITEMENT FROM THE SUBJECT. ON THE WHOLE IT IS A WORTHY BOOK FOR ANY READER--PROFESSIONAL OR BUFF."
4,Another Winner by Williston Walker,"This classic work includes the actual texts of Congregationalism's major ""creeds and platforms""--statements on doctrine and polity adopted by various Congregational bodies. Walker's explanatory notes are particularly enlightening. The book, now regrettably out of print, would be useful to any student of New England history or Anglo-American Protestantism."
2,What a small stage,On first view it is a disappoiting effort to re-capture the neds sound and stage presence. I mean look at 'walking to syrup' concert video and you will see what I mean - wolves civic hall was what neds was all about - the venue in shoot the neds is tiny..... small stage reducing the classic neds live performance they were so good at.
4,Important book for this interested in the life of this yogi,"This book is a collection of writings by and about the Maharishi (mostly about). It covers many details of his life and teachings, as well as social commentary about the master. For someone like me who was not familiar with the Maharishi, I found it interesting to see what an enormous impact this Eastern guru has had on the western world. Definitely worth a read."
3,Would have been much better as a magazine article,"The author works hard to build suspense in his final selection of ""J. Average"", the Average American. He also selectively reveals elements of his own life story to add focus to his project. On both counts, the book failed to capture my interest.I enjoyed the first three chapters of this book- then I realized that the structure was choppy but repetitive. Had the author condensed the first and last chapters into an essay, it would have been memorable. As published, I skimmed large sections in the middle of the book and don't feel that I missed anything."
5,Most comfortable casual shoes you will ever wear!,"This shoe is so comfortable from the minute you put it on--no breaking in is necessary. They are attractive and wear well and last a long time. This is my second pair and I only got it because my original pair is over 15 years old and looking a little ragged to wear out in public. I don't normally pay this much for a pair of shoes, but these will surely pay for themselves over time. Get a pair, you won't regret it."
5,Good fit,Easy Spirit tennis shoes are the best for my feet that I have found. They have good cushioning and arch support. These are relatively inexpensive as far as Easy Spirit's go. I am very happy with my new shoes so far. They have met the Easy Spirit threshold as I expected.
1,Very Dissatisfied,"Warehouse has shipped me the identical, wrong size 3 times! Granted, they sent me a free return lable 3 times, but having ordered these in early Dec. and had to return 3, plus 3 calls to customer service, may be the last FootSmart product I buy."
5,The shoe was people that have to walk at work!,"This is my 3rd pair of AP1 Easy Spirits - each pair lasts from 2-3 years at least, and I have to walk ALOT for work. These wear well and are very comfortable! I hope Easy Spirit NEVER stops making this type!"
3,Ok but that's it,I bought these shoes for myself. They look nice but there is no arch support and they just don't fit all that well. They are sitting in my closet and will probably end up at the local Goodwill.
5,Great Shoes!,I have worn this model of EAsy Spirit for a long time...Hope they don't discontinue it...Wears well..I have narrow feet so I like the way these fit and are available in AA width...
5,Great product,Wife pleased. The shoes were the right size and and my wife likes the feel of the shoes. She has purchased Easy Spirit shoes for years and these worked well as well.Thank you.G. Janson
2,Needs a Revised Design,"I have a hard time finding shoes that fit with my high arches. I hesitate to order tennis shoes because most of them are poorly designed -- they are designed to kill your ankles, rub them raw when walking, and damage your achilles tendon. This shoe is just another example: my ankle has been rubbed raw with just a 1 mile walk. I would walk 2.5 to 3 miles, but the pain on the ankle and achilles tendon prevent that.This shoe is parially made in the US and partially made in China -- let's get shoes made in wholly in the US."
5,ss,"Love these shoes....been wearing them for more than 10 years and is my only choice for looks, comfort and style"
4,Easy Spirit Womens AP1 sneaker,"I have worn this brand for years, but the more recent ones are not as well made.The leather isnot of same quality."
4,always good,This is a great sneaker in any color. Narrow is pretty narrow however. You can not go wrong with this shoe.
5,Perfect Fit -Very Comfortable,"I have had my new Easy Spirit shoes for about 2 weeks. I love the fit and comfort of the shoes. I walk daily at least 2- 3 times and day, and I was looking for shoes that would give me the support I need, and were at the same time comfortable. I was leery about ordering shoes online because I usually like to try them on. But I took a chance, ordered my regular size, and the fit is perfect. If you are looking for a stylish and comfortable shoe that is good for walking, I think these shoes would be a good buy."
4,Cloudy Comfort,I enjoy this pair of shoes that supports my arches with cloudy comfort. I have wide problem feet and these support my problem feet.
2,Easyspirit sport sneakers...,My Mom wanted these shoes. She has a terrible time getting shoes that fit her feet. Aways before there was no problem but this time the quality was definitely poorer! The part of the shoe that fits around her ankle is loose and doesn't fit well..she is quite disappointed! and they are made in China...that bites too! She doesn't plan on buying another pair!
2,Horrendous heel slip,"I purchased these shoes because they came wide, and I have a wide forefoot and bunions. Unfortunately, the heels on these shoes are as wide as the front of the shoe, and I could not lace them up enough to keep the heels from slipping. I have never seen such a wide heel on any shoe. Why do shoe makers assume your entire foot is wide? These shoes might work for someone with swollen feet or a very wide foot all over, but they did not fit me at all in the heel. They are not as clunky as many wide shoes, and the leather was soft. I am returning the shoes, and continuing my quest for a wide, decent-looking shoe with a normal heel width."
2,Philips Ultra-compact Tripod with 3-WAY Pan & Tilt Head,"Flimsy and shakey,not a very sturdy product..keeps falling down all over the place..got to babysit it to protect my camera..."
1,cheap substitute,"The book sent was a cheap substitute, with different ISBN number, to the one ordered. It was a modern reprint, by Barnes and Noble with very poor quality paper. Hence 1 star! It even spells the author's name wrongly on the title page!!If you just want a cheap read, this is fine, but only pay the reprint price. I got my money back OK but still can't get the original Oxford University Press version advertised. Which is worth 5 stars! This is a standard reference book, complete with Kings lists, by the definitive expert of the Sumerians, and a ""must have"" for anyone interested in the subject."
3,Outdated?,"Woolley said it was the Semetic people who ruined the purity of the Sumerian race and therefore caused the destruction of Sumerian civilization. It was written in the 1960s. Easy to read, less than 200 pages, informative..."
5,It's in the bag!,"I am trying in my middle age to develop some adult responsibility, thus bought this First Aid kit for the Jeep. Will likely never use it, but if I do it seems to have everything for wounds, bug bites, blisters, etc. Well designed, clear instructions, compact size. Have used many kits, in many different situations, this one is very well thought out."
3,Great organization,"I ordered this product a couple of weeks ago, and although I haven't had to use it yet I am pleased withthe overall quality of the product. It has the basic essentials, and is organized into clearly labeled pouches.I wanted a simple first aid kit that would take of the minor injuries that can occur on an everyday basis,and I think this is the first aid kit for the job. My only disappointment would be that if I would want toexpand it in the future that there is very little extra room to add extra things. Also when it shipped I putin the wrong address by mistake since I am a college student, and their customer service wasn't very respectfulor helpful in helping me locate the package. Other than that its a great deal, just make sure to put in thecorrect address!"
4,"Good, with one (serious) caveat","A good, no-nonsense book that should have beginning longboarders up and annoying shortboarders in no time flat. Werner covers the basics without any mystification, cutting through the crap and helping people understand just what that 747-sized piece of expoxy doing under their feet.Two (I lied) quick caveats:1) Werner's style isn't for everyone, however, replete as it is with somewhat self-conscious ""wannas"" and ""gottas"" and ""doyas."" You either nod along, or toss the book across the table.2) For a beginner's book, it is somewhat strangely deficient in really getting inside how a board is trimmed. From Werner's point of view as a long-time surfer it may feel as straightforward and logical as he describes it, but from a beginner's point of view there are all sorts of painful subtleties that Werner glosses over. Too bad."
2,Hope you already know how to surf...,"This book is written by a shortboard surfer who has taken up longboarding. It is written from that perspective. This is not a good book for beginners.I am a longboarder with 2 seasons of limited experience. From this book, I gained a knowledge longboard design and how to choose one to suit my needs. I also gained info on techniques to get past the breakers. I didn't get much else.I was looking for a good explanation and diagrams of etiquete, good starting techniques. I found brief explanations, again, written from a surfer-to-surfer perspective. I found more detailed info free while surfing the web.I also agree with another review that the language of the book is surfer lingo (dude) and seems out of place for an instructional book.I'm selling it back. I'll look for a good instructional video."
4,Great Book,"This is a great book for anyone learning to longboard. There is a ton of great information in here I have not found anywhere else including a friend of mine who has been surfing for over 20 years. Yeah he adresses the reader assuming you're a shortboarder but so what? The information is still there. Everyone who is bent out of shape because of this is missing the point. If your thinking of getting this book, do so."
3,What did they do!,"What did they do to this film? There are so many 5-10 second blackouts throughout this dvd which leads me to believe that they cut out quite a bit. Sometimes during the blackouts you can hear music or talking but nothing on the screen. Also for each part, they restart the film over with reviews from the last part and character introductions. This dvd looks like an amatuer put it together. The film was a truly inspirational movie when it first appeared on TV. Still though, I did enjoy seeing this film once again and will add it to my historic collection. I think we all need to revisit what these people went through to really appreciate life and what we have."
3,quality of the DVD,"I never write about the quality of the DVD, as I am not obsessed with that feature. This DVD, howver, was notoriously horrible and I felt like I was watching a movie in 1961 on a Magnavox TV. When my wife, who cares less about home theater, than my 2 poodles, comments that the picture quality stinks, believe me, there is a problem. The movie was fairly good, but the picture quality really distracted from the experience. This was worse than watching it on a VHS tape."
5,THE HOLOCAUST,"I watched this on network tv when it premiered. It's even harder to watch it today. With twenty years of ethnic cleansings, and smaller holocausts under our belts, one of the major themes of the story holds even truer. If we aren't very very careful any of us can become a killer."
3,timeless masterpiece,Finally an American release .I had a European version also on 3 discs but found the picture quality less than acceptable. The new American release I hate to say is not much of an improvement. Even watching on my Blu Ray player which upgrades standard DVD's I found the picture was not sharp and detailed. The story itself and the production are top notch.
5,Much better than I thought it might be...,"At first I was concerned that a TV mini-series made in the late 1970's just wouldn't hold up to 2009 ""entertainment"" standards, if that is the right word for such a painful topic.But I was moved by how truly affecting it really is. Although it is a story that deals with the lives of I think 8 different characters, and therefore suffers from a slight loss in character identification, it remains a powerful film. The production values are superb, most of the acting is outstanding, and from what I know of that period in history (via Richard Evans' great books and others I've read) it manages to convey, accurately, the main events through the characters' experiences, and without undue exposition. Having said that, I think one's appreciation of the of the story can be helped by knowing the basic outline of the major events of the period, and the prime players in the Third Reich before watching the film. Recommended!"
2,Contains Serious Distortions of Historical Events,"Well do I remember this series on television over thirty years ago. My younger self came away with the impression that Jewish sufferings were placed above those of other victims of WWII. (I had never seen the media pay this much attention to non-Jewish genocides, and haven't to this day). Indeed, the 1970's was the time that placed the Holocaust in a dominant position in US culture and education. See Peczkis Listmania: FORGOTTEN HOLOCAUST...The series itself contains ludicrous, Polonophobic falsifications of history. But don't take my word for it. Please click on the following analysis done by a Polish Jew who actually went through the Holocaust, and read my review of it:Our Answer to T.V.'s Holocaust, an anti-Polish Show: A Proud Polish-Jew Tells it Like it Is"
1,Too much talking and not enough torture.,Too much talking and not enough torture. The DVD arrived on time and was in good shape.Not your typical Holocaust show.
3,GLAD IT'S ON DVD... BUT COULD BE BETTER,"I PRE-ORDERED THIS SET AS SOON AS IT WAS ANNOUNCED.I SAW THIS MINISERIESBACK IN 1978 WHEN IT AIRED ON NBC OVER 4 NIGHTS.THE AMAZON PRICE FOR THISITEM IS GREAT AT ONLY $19.95 - BUT THE CONTENT IS NOT SO GREAT.PICTUREAND SOUND IS O.K.-NO MORE.PRINTED IN SMALL LETTERS ON THE BACK OF THEBOX IS THE DISCLAIMER ""MAY BE EDITED FROM THE ORIGINAL NETWORK BROADCAST""MAYBE IS RIGHT..THIS SET CLOCKS IN AT ABOUT 449 MINUTES WHICH IS 26-34MINUTES LESS THE FULL RUNNING TIME.WHATS MORE THERE ARE NO FEATURES ONTHIS 3 DISC SET-NOT A SINGLE ONE.CBS VIDEO AND PARAMOUNT SHOULD BE ASHAMEDOF THEMSELVES..THE 30 YEAR ""ANNIVERSARY EDITION"" OF THIS MINISERIES WHICHWAS TRULY A TELEVISION LANDMARK DESERVED MUCH,MUCH BETTER.."
5,The holocaust,"I first watched this mini sereis when it was first released on TV back in the late 1970's. I found it extremely moving then, and it has not lost any of the powerful messages thirty years on. I thoroughly recommend it."
2,"Terrible script, mediocre direction, miscast","I agree with one reviewer that the script lacks believable dialogue. Many of the statements seem to be historical fact disguised as part of discussion between the characters as if there is a need to continually explain what and why to the audience.My wife and I just finished Fortunes of War and are almost done with War & Remembrance. This mini-series was quite below par when compared with those two series. One can see why good writing is important to a mini-series and why Holocaust fell miserably short in this endeavor. I also didn't understand why the director had some of the key Nazi roles (Dorf, Heydrich, & Eichman) played so one-dimensionally. The actors chosen to portray Heydrich & Eichman didn't even begin to look like their characters, much less present a performance that would make you believe them as such.After watching a couple hours, my wife and I put the DVD back into its container and saved ourselves from further misery."
5,History,I hadn't seen this since it came out of network TV and saw it and thought then how powerful it was. Over 30 years later it still is powerful.
2,Where Is The Whole Movie? Huh?,"I have to agree with the negative reviews of this DVD version of ""Holocaust"". This presentation of the horrific murder of millions of people during WWII is timeless and educational. However; the transfer could have been better. The video contranst is bright and the audio is a little muddy at times. The biggest gripe is that this version has been edited from the orginal. Buy if you must but you won't be getting the full meal deal. HEY PARAMOUNT AND CBS: restore, remaster and reissue an uncut version of this mini-series and charge $39.95. You'll make millions."
4,Holocaust,I received the DVD very quickly. Haven't had a chance to view it yet. I do look forward to seeing it as soon as I have a chance.
3,Well-intentioned melodrama,"This film is more important for its historical impact than either its verisimilitude or aethestic quality as drama. It is a well-intentioned melodrama that is great on making people cry and not so great on making them think very much. Not sure what to say about the scene when Meryl Streep walks up to a concentration camp gate, knocks on the gate, in order to join her husband who is a prisoner. But there is no denying the film's importance in getting people on both sides of the Atlantic to look at the event of the Holocaust."
2,VEIWERS--BEWARE!,"After waiting so long for this series to be released on DVD, this sure was a big letdown. I have the Goodtime VHS version and although the picture quality is not that great at least it showed the complete uncut series. The DVD version is so chopped up it is very hard to really appreciate the movie. For those of you who have not purchase this DVD yet, do yourself a favor. Try and find a copy of the VHS version."
2,waited a long time,I waited a long time for this mini-series to hit DVD. I'm disappointed that many scenes were missing. C'mon guys; restore on DVD the entire film.
2,Holocaust,"The movie- what there was of it- was good, and the acting superb. HOWEVER, the case it came in said it was to approx. 7 hrs. and 30 min. long. In fact, it was only 5 hrs. and 10-20 minutes long, with big gaps between each CD.Therefore, parts of it were hard to follow."
5,Holocaust,I am pleased to have a DVD in my library that represents such an important part of World War II history. May this horrific period in time never be forgotten and not allowed to happen again.
4,Compelling historical fiction,"I recorded this TV mini-series on VHS when it was originally aired, complete with stops and starts and commercials. I was happy to be able to buy it on DVD. Others have noted that this version has been cut in places. If this is true, I did not notice what parts were missing - and I have watched my old VHS copies several times. This is a compelling and heart-wrenching story, and I would recommend it to anyone who has interest in this period of time in history."
5,GOOD TO DO BUSINESS WITH,"GOOD TO DO BUSINESS WITH.FAST, AND NEW AND ON TIME. ALL WENT WELL WITH THIS .WILL DO BUSINESS AGAIN with THIS COMPANY."
2,Teacher's Bible commentary,"Bought this book with the view of gaining in depth from others to enrich my understanding of God's word so that I would continually be a blessing to those I teach. Currently I am teaching on the book of Leviticus and what I got from the section I am studying was nothing beyond the OBVIOUS.I was a bit disappointed really. However, I must say I haven't read the whole material but the bits I have seen and needed at the time I wanted it wasn't impressive.In my HONEST opinion the TITLE of the book suggest more than its content. If you are already into serious academic studies and commentaries. The book might not mean much to you."
5,Man of Parts,"The author is much more than the usual political drone/hack. Instead, a talented storyteller and wry reporter about the back side of a political campaign. Regardless of your politics, enjoy this inside and sardonic look at the campaign sausage-making process."
1,The Media President,"Ahhhha continuation of the ""reagan"" legacy. The legacy of a carefully constructed public image of a presidential candidate put forth to the American Public. An image constructed not of reality, but of cliche. Of polls. The very idea of chronicling the CONSTRUCTION of this false image should pull the rug out of anyone wondering if they've ever seen ""the real"" George W. Bush. Mind you, the images and information distributed, even today, are only what they want us to see. Can't blame the campaign as much as the media who eagerly lapped it up...the large corporate media the right wing so often called ""liberal."" What b.s. These large multinational corporations are big business. Big business who #1 want the government to get off their backs, and #2, LOVE having free stuff from Bush's staff...they don't have to pay for the pretty images. This book puts both a capital ""C"" in cynical, and a capital ""H"" in hypocrisy. It's a shame Shrub doesn't read more, this book might just embarass him."
5,A Quantum Leap in Hands On Debating Instruction!,As a former Australian Primary Schools Debating champion I have never had the pleasure to read a more cogent and succinct anaylysis of debating. Not only have I prospered as a debater from reading this book but after lending it to my team we became a more effective and enthusiastic operating unit.I have searched far and wide for a better debating book but I am yet to find one. Bravo Hooke and Philips - World Debating Champions and now Champion Debating Instructors. This book remains a debaters bible and best friend.
1,Too little content and too much ego,As a debating coach and adjudicator I found little in this book to recommend it. Australian debaters would be better off with the excellent Australian Debating Federation Manual. The analysis is superficial and the comments are not very helpful. More offputting is the negative commentary from the authors regarding their opponents in debates. This provides a bad example for other debaters. Save your money.
4,"Crazy Techno, Great for Partying!","If i were to have a party i would just put this album in my stereo and let it spin all night long, all the songs just slide right into the next with different beets, and lyrics one after another for 62 minutes.... The Best songs are ""the launch"" by DJ Jean, ""you dont know me"" by Armand Van Helden, ""the funk return"" by Subsonic, and ""a DJ saved my life"" by many different unknown DJ's.... if your a partier and you like clubbin buy this album you wont be disappionted.."
3,"ehhh, if you catch him live and you own this be prepared....","ive seen rhv a couple of times since he started touring for this cd and each time it seemed as if though he hadnt gotten any new promos in.... the cd is alright nice to get you pumped if youre going out for a night of raving, but if you really want to sit down and listen, kind of gets annoying at the slams from song to song, i much prefer to hear some blended mixing that makes me wonder whoa, whered he pull that from... also kind of upsetting that because its a commercial release non of the bootlegs he plays out get put into this... ie, Everybodys better off free... that weird mix of the launch thats been played out and stuff like that"
2,Stars on 45 meets house music,"Sorry to be the one person who didn't like this albumn, but I gotta say it - he's got some great tracks here, but you barely get to hear 30 seconds of any of 'em. This'd've been a great double albumn, but as is, it's just too broken up - it might've been fun to hear him spin this live, once, but this isn't really a repeat listen for me."
2,54 great tracks on 1 CD mix = GARBAGE,"That is correct, 30 second snippets on 1 CD means that you end up with a disc that sucks. Don't get me wrong, Richard Vission is a great DJ, but this is a disaster. Don't get me wrong, each song on that disc is totally sweet, but you will hear it only for a couple of seconds and then its gone. His other two albums are amazing1) Damn that DJ made my Day2) Automatic"
2,Mmmmm... Richrad?,"I love Richard Humapty Vision. He's gotta his own style and always hass a good selection of songs. But this one... I am not sure about that. The mix is kinda annoying and fragmented... Same technic he has been using for long time... Maybe I get bored with it and wanna see something new and kicks from him. I still like Richard so am lookin' forward to his next ""new"" album."
