5,20 great Darin performances from his TV show.,"Bobby is wonderful in these songs from his variety show. There are also added a couple of Ed Sullivan show appearances. There are no notes on or inside the cover, but that is NOT Bobby's fault.Darin fans can explore Bobby on the DVD's ""Beyond the Song"" , ""Mack is Back"", ""The Songmakers Collection by A&E;"", plus ""Aces Back to Back"" .There is a terrific fan website[...]."
4,Could be better.,The sound can be better and it doesn't have a wide screen view but Bobby does the difference.
5,The Best of Bobby,"I thought that I heard all of Bobby's songs until I bought this CD and was amazed with the power and depth of the songs. I love the R&B of 'Work Song', it has to be one of his sexist performances,I am hooked all over again.I have alot of Bobby's CD's,movies and magazines, and just about everything Bobby, but that was before I heard this CD. It is one of the best (if not the best) CD I have in my Bobby collection. I think after 'worshiping' Bobby for so long, I finally get it...the genius of Bobby is yet to come..."
5,Love it!,"My Mom got me started on this stuff... Since then, she has not only got me addicted to it, she has gotten several friends addicted too! MAN I LOVE THIS STUFF!!!!!"
1,Doesn't taste like peanut butter,"I purchased a jar of this at my local Sun harvest. Sadly, it doesn't taste at ALL like peanut butter!"
1,"If you like medicine, then buy it.","I really rate this item at less than zero, but I was forced to give it one star. It had a medicinal taste, and made me gag. The company makes you buy 6 jars--it is a rip off."
4,Purchased this book because of HK review above.,"And totally agree with her comments. It's well written with solid plots and intrique. The ""romance"" is cute but minimal and could have easily been strengthened.Hence the 4* rating instead of 5*. Overall a good, enjoyable read."
4,Great guide for restaurant reviews!,"This is one of three books we used on our trip in November of 1998. The best part of this book is the detailed reviews of all of the eating establishments. There are a ton of restaurant reviews, and they are very detailed. We found the recommendations to be right on the money. The do it yourself tours and adventures are not as detailed in this book as in the Lonely Planet book. If you're more of an adventurous type, I would recommend getting the Lonely Planet book as well. The combination of these two books would make the perfect guide. You can read all about our trip and how we used these two books in my travel report on Subacharter.com."
3,Average Guidebook,"We purchased this book to plan our honeymoon mainly because of the 5 star reviews we read on this site. While the author does provide a lot of information on the different islands in the South Pacific, and some great food recommendations, nothing about this book sets it apart from the other guide books we brought along to Tahiti. In short, compared to other tour books we've fallen in love with, this book is average."
3,"Very informative, but could use more maps and pictures","More informative than Frommer's (I bought both), but also could have used more pictures and maps.A lot has changed in the last several years with the depressed economy, so blogs on TripAdvisor were more useful."
1,Tahiti & French Polynesia Guide by Jan Prince,I just purchased this book and what I recieved was a volume with a copyright of 1998!! It obviously had not been updated since before the 2008 recession and contained out of date and useless information.
1,no closed captions,I bought this dvd and was surprised to see it had no closed captions. My hearing is very bad and I require captions. Most dvd produced these days have them. I never did watch the series but I still own the disk.Recommendation for Amazon: please indicate clearly on your sales pages whether CC is included - it is important for your deaf customers and it might spur rogue producers (like the producers of Durham county) to create them for their products.
4,Mary,"Although the characters are well played, this is a little more dark then I perfer. It would have to be an acquired taste."
2,Not Anamorphic Widescreen,"I really dug this series. It's a very surreal, disturbing crime drama. Anyone who likes Twin Peaks would probably enjoy this series.Unfortunately this release is not Anamorphic widescreen. What a surprise to put in the disc and have this tiny square image in the middle of my HDTV. In order to view it correctly, I had to adjust my TV to stretch the image.From what I understand, the Canadian/Anchor Bay version of this show IS anamorphic widescreen. I highly recommend you spend a little extra to get that imported then to pick up a disc that feels like it was created in 1995."
3,Above average for the genre,"This is not at all a bad series but no where near the Wire, my absolute favourite in terms of plot, writing and acting. Still it is better than the trash that one gets all too often these days. Come on David Simon! We need you to follow up the brilliant Wire and Generation Kill."
4,a healthiful choice,"I was looking for emulsifier when I encountered a few website suggesting lecithin. Then I realized it is a much healthy suppliment to kids' and adults' nutrition. Have been putting it into everything I bake, can't taste any difference if I keep the addition within couple of tablespoons.Wish there's a smaller package, or local grocery carried it.Wish there's this powdered form to act as cake emulsifier, which provides better distribution of oil among flour, and makes cakes tender without excess amount of fat.Overall, it is a good product and serves for healthy cooking."
5,Awesome!,This album is awesome! I know some of the guys personally and they are great punk rockers. Hopefully you will check out their CD and help to make them become famous because they are good enough for sure.
4,Zyxtel Router,"I had some problems getting it to communicate with our cable modem at first. Had to reboot the modem to get everything working, but it has been working fine since then except when I made a setting change on the router, I had to reboot it to regain modem communication. As long as I leave it alone, it seems reliable. The router it replaced kept losing the broadband connection. LAN connections have been flawless."
4,Fossil Watch - Quick Turn Sport - Black,"it arrived sooner than i expected, but one of the pins was loose, so i had to had it (the pin) replaced."
1,NO STICKER'S????,"i understand that i purchased this item used, however i also purchased 3 other reusable sticker books used and they came with the stickers? this one did NOT, and it was very upsetting to me that when the seller listed the item, they did not mention that there were NO stickers for it anymore."
5,Stargirl Book Review by K,"The book I am going to review is Stargirl by Jerry Spinelli. Stargirl basically was happy being one of a kind, but changed herself for the boy she loved. Stargirl started out life with the name ""Susan"" but she thought it didn't fit her anymore when she moved from place to place. But after awhile, she got nervous and began to change to be like everyone else.I loved this book, I could not get enough of it!! It is one of the best books I ever read, it was mostly happy except for the parts where she cries. But technically it is not a book that will make you cry. So if you have not read this book, I suggest you do!!!!!"
5,Lovely and interesting,"This is a lovely book, I enjoyed the stories about each bag, and the photos. There is a good variety of bags, with skill levels from basic to advanced. I probably will never knit most of them, but I learned a lot from reading the directions. The style of the bags is definitely ethnic, most are brightly colored, they may not suit everyone's taste."
5,Folk Bags,"I am a knitter and needed a pattern out of this book and did not want to spend $24 when all I needed was one pattern, I found a used one on Amazon and purchased it and it was in great shape when I got it and have started the pattern that I bought the book for."
2,"Good intro, bad study guide.","Full of errors, their math just doesn't, ""add up."" For example, a practice question on page 49 asks; what ar the common factors of 48 and 36? Their provided answer, ""c. the common factors are 1,2,3,6, and 12. In addition to plain errors what I find most annoying is the sparse and at times absent explanation of the steps taken to arrive at a particular answer."
4,Real sex in people's minds and bedrooms,"This book is full of real sex. It offers provocative insights and observations that are well articulated yet not abstracted from the sweaty, visceral sensuality of what really goes on in people's minds and bedrooms."
5,The Pet Goat: A work of genius,This is the stuff that makes great men so great. Should be a required reading for leaders of men. Presidential material. I found it so rich and powerful that I had to take seven minutes to reflect and decide what to do next.
1,Awful waste of my money,"I bought this book when I saw it rated highly on an Amazon list that contained quite a few other horror books that I had enjoyed reading. I could not even finish this book; I forced myself through the first 50 pages before I gave up. It was very poorly written, and full of bad cliches; in the first few pages one of the protagonists kills a bad guy by driving his nose into his brain using his fist. Come on, Jack. Not only is this incredibly overused, it's also not possible.If your looking for a good gruesome read, look elsewhere. Avoid this book."
2,Lacking in substance and credibility,"The author has some good ideas in terms of plot and originality; however he seems to be inexperienced in terms of his ability to translate this into a credible story. The characters are not believable and somewhat one dimensional. They seem to think, feel and behave however the author believes is necessary to advance the plot; not however the way one would expect multi-dimensional complicated human beings to think, feel and behave. Consequently it is hard to dredge up any real feeling for any of the characters (beyond an incredulous ""Who would do that?""). Another big down side to the book, being that it's a horror novel; is it just plain isn't scary. Not even shudder worthy. However as Mr. Priest does show some raw talent and definitly evidences the kind of determination necessary to be a successful author; I wouldn't write him off entirely. It would be interesting to see what he could do with a couple of psychology and creative writing courses under his belt."
2,derivative and silly,"I bought this book on a whim because I was bored and I thought it might be an interesting story with some supernatural and historical elements. But I was wrong. While I hoped the story would be as good as those by Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child, it turned out that this was just another simple vampire/werewolf story with no new ideas. Preston and Child are capable of weaving intricate stories with historical details and supernatural twists that capture the mind. Mr. Priest jotted down a straightforward monster story with no intrigue. Preston and Child developed a fascinating character in Agent Pendergast, while Priest concocted one-dimensional characters. For most of the book, the good guys beat the hell out of the witch and she just keeps coming back for more-very tedious and comical (I kept picturing the coyote and road runner cartoons.) There is really nothing noteworthy about this book. Mr. Priest needs to do some serious research before he attempts to write another novel."
3,chill out and watch!!!,"If you are looking for a cool movie to chill out with and drink a beer with friends then this is it. I bought my copy and I watched it a couple times already. Good acting,good music,and the movie flows nicely. Good film to invite some friends over to watch with you. So, drink some beers and watch the film!!!"
4,"relaxing, soulful, meditative,","Beautiful album, guru's guitar playing, and snatam's soaring improv's are what make this album one of my very faves ofGuru Ganesha Singhs....keep them coming...:)"
5,Great Line Dance Collection with easy-to-follow instructions,"From the liner notes:So was it Billy Ray Cyrus, Dwight Yoakum or the Rednex who are responsible for the ""Dance Fever"" that's gripped the world? Or was it a vain attempt to inflict a 90's version of that other ""fever?""Who cares. It's fun, it's lively and anyone can do it. So whilst you're listening to the talents of the great Grammy Award Nominees The Moody Brothers, why not try a Line Dance that has been suggested by Dave Moody to accompany the first three songs on the album.Happy Line Dancing!!!!"
4,His Little Instruction Book for Getting Her to Say Yes...Mor,This is one of the cutest little books I have read. A lot of thought and detail seems to have gone into writing the book. It seems as tho the authors asked lots of folks to share their thoughts on the subject. It was very funny and the folks in my office all shared and laughed over the book.
4,Former student praises work,"I read this book as a student of Dr. Saiedi's in 1994. The depth of his analysis and the sophistication of his synthesis of literature, philosophy, and cultural sciences that I enjoyed in lectures are captured in this dense and labrynthine work. The core of his argument is that social theory is a unique syntehsis of various European intellectual traditions, especially the epistemology of the Enlightenment and the political action theories of Romanticism. This approach offers an understadning of social theory that cleaves essentialist dichotomies such as positivist/relativist, functionalist/Marxist, or conservative/radical. This perspective is not merely a question of social tehory's origins, but also reveals how current discourse draws from both traditions. I highly reccomend this work for those intrigued by our own capacity to conceive and anaylze the social realities we navigate."
4,Red is the Color for me,These earrings are exactly as shown. My only regret was that the stones were not of a redder hue. These stones were brown even when held to the light.
5,Induction study in a great way of teaching how to study the bible,This is the first induction Bible study I have done and I appreciated the authors ability to teach us how to study the bible on our own. It caused me to have insight into portions of Scripture that I had completely overlooked before.Enjoyed the teaching method very much.
5,Great Book!,Book offers a great deal of suggestions and easy to do activities. Activities could work with very young children and still can be challenging for those a bit older but struggling. I definately recommend it.
5,Great Book for K-2 grades,"I bought this on recommendation of a fellow teacher from another school. It is a great resource for teaching activities with number patterns, games to 100, etc. Can't wait to use it next year."
3,Good not great,"This is an ok series of books. I have read the first two and they aren't my favorites, but they do have an ok story. If you want to read a really good YA spy book, read the Alex Rider books by Anthony Horowitz."
4,Terrific musicianship through and through,"If your looking for some real music by a real muscian, than Peter Stone Brown's ""Up Against It"" is your destination.A wouderful blend of Folk, Blues and Rock that never disapoints, unlike what the mass recording business pushes on the public today. Mr. Brown delivers true, heart felt songs from the amusing to the sorrowful, it never misses to move the listener."
4,"good intelligent, rocking cd with solid backup","A fun album with some nifty hooks and phrases. Brown gathered together a truly impressive group of backing musicians to bring this cd into its own.written well, produced well...what more can you ask"
4,melodically dylanesque,"Anybody who bought Dylan's most recent album based on reviews by sentimental critics owe it to themselves to shell out a few bucks for Mr. Brown's CD. This guy has the wit, voice and melodic ear to take you back to the glory years of Dylan."
5,Soulful blend of country music and rock and roll,"Peter Stone Brown has given us a soulful blend of country music and rock and roll without contriving to do so. The upbeat songs will perfectly enhance the experience of driving through some pretty countryside. The slower songs will make you think. If you don't like this album, you are wrong."
3,"yeah, but.......","I hate to break up the review love fest here, but... well let me say that these are good songs, done real well, and it's good listening. But the extent to which these songs borrow (I'm being kind here) from Dylan is pretty epic. I mean, Rockabilly Guy is straight out of the Basement Tapes' humorous monologues, and elsewhere the themes and instrumentation and chord changes, not to mention the nearly dead-on Dylan phrasing, make this almost a scholarly study of Bob. I think I could quote about a dozen references easy if I had to. Which is fine I guess, but somewhere underneath these songs is a killer original songwriter who's still moored to Bob's dock. My advice is, next one, pull in your rope and sail on your own winds. That'll be a truly exhilarating journey to hear."
5,What A Good Read!,"It was interesting to see how this outstanding author arrived at the front door to the creativity of his poetry. Mr. Hopkins is a clever writer, who produced an extraordinary first work. The book keeps your attention and is hard to put down. For a real life adventure on copper wings, 'Golden Dreams' is a golden pick - you won't be disappointed!"
5,Frogazoom,"It is a wonderful book for chidren of all ages. The artwork is beautiful. The text is fun to say and to listen to. The story draws the attention of the children into the adventure. The play on words of the frog as he sings and wanders through the bog is also a lesson about not talking to stangers. Using your head and thinking things out is important. Anger and force are not necessary to overcome any problem. The eco-facts in the back of the book also expands the knowledge and helps them understand a little more about the world the characters live in.An excellent resource for the family, in the pre-school, and the elementary classroom. Even better if you have the author visit the schools for a more fun one on one story telling with the children, allowing the use of all the imaginations of the children present.We need more wholesome books like this that capture the fun and facts all in one. Please give us more books like this!"
2,Different Perspective,"The author does a good job of presenting common issues from a different perspective. You are not going to find business solutions, but it may open your eyes that there isn't one way to address a problem or change your point of view."
3,Fair condition,"The book itself was in good condition, although when opening the packaging surrounding the book, I noticed that there was a HUGE bug that was squished on the book cover."
3,The Elegant Enigma,"I was very excited to read this book, as I very much enjoy learning the path of mysterious texts. This book presents many possibilities for the origins of the codex. I personally don't have patience to cipher the many options the authors gave in cracking the text, but I appreciated the layers of work they put into presenting them. Also, I was pleased that they did not shy away from esoteric possibilities. The description of it being a written account of glossolalia was particularly interesting. All the same, this book is more about the figures around the manuscript. Whatever you come away believing about the source of the text, it's path has been colorfully impressive."
4,An intriguing account,"After discovering this enigmatic manuscript over wikipedia, this book was the natural step in satisfying my curiosity. I was not disappointed, for the authors did a great job in exploring the various aspects of this mystery, while cruising through much interesting stuff as medieval codes, historical linguistics, insane artists and the like. The mystery remains, but so much can be learned in the effort of solving it!highly recommended."
4,Understanding the Obsqure,This book is a very interesting read for persons of a certain education. Not easily understood by many readers.
2,book not a thorough treatise of the subject,"Although somewhat comprehensive early on, the book dwells on the Chevrolet from 1955 to 1957 and then turns to truck design. Many of the makes and models of the 50's get left out as a result."
4,Biography video - Edgar Allan Poe,Well done video that details the life and works of Edgar Allan Poe. My students enjoyed the video and it enhanced our discussion times about Poe and his poetry. I would recommend this video.
5,An excellent resource for the classroom.,I used this as an introduction to his life and works. It was engaging and enlightening. A terrific introductory resource to use before you launch into Poe.
4,Biography- Edgar Allan Poe DVD,Very interesting and informative! It allowed me to think of more questions that were not always answered in film. It would have been better if it were an actual movie.
4,"Big, Real Big","I bought this system to place in my garage in oder to play my MP3 player through the speakers. The sound is great playing in MP3, CD, or radio mode. It has a handy remote to adjust or change channels but, it's small and I'll probably spend a lot of time looking for it. For the price range I don't believe there is a better deal but, it is big, I mean real big so, don't plan on carrying it around too much. For me, other than the gaudy looks and the size, it will serve it's purpose. Please keep in mind that this review is coming from a 52 year old man so, my bet is that if you're in your 20's and 30's this unit is just what you are looking for."
2,Disappointing,"Based on the size of it and on the other reviews I thought it would be loud and powerful. It's not. The volume max's out at 10 and it's not really loud at all. It has strong base which sort of compensates for that but for the size and mass of the thing it is really pitifully weak.Programming pre-sets is complicated. Not intuitive at all. You need to push buttons on both sides of the radio. Not easy like it should be like in all car stereos.Then, while tuning in stations, you need to look at the display right? But it's not so easy because the buttons you have to hit are on top of it, while the tiny little unlit display is on the front. So, as I am looking down on it to see what I am doing, the display is not visible.I can't believe this thing got so many good reviews. If you want a BOOMING boom box, KEEP SHOPPING. It is weak, and designed by a total knucklehead."
3,average prod,its heavier than it looks. The sound isn't as good as I expected. Its kinda ugly. 20 watts is not enough if you live in the mountains.
5,Sound is Unbelievable!,"I wanted a portable radio that delivered great sound and this is all that for the price. I can connect my Droid phone and play I Heart Radio, or Pandora and the sound it great."
4,Ghetto Blaster,"I knew it was going to be big, heavy and ugly, and sound good, when I ordered it, it is all of that, I think it is great, the only thing I would change is that the digital display is small, everything else is big, I love the bass, and powerful sound, it is good for outdoor use."
4,We bought this for a youth group,"Is it a boom box? Or a ghetto blaster?Either way, it's a win.A bit overdone on the appearance, mind you, but a solid product with an aux in for MP3 players.One more star if it didn't look so cheesy."
3,No backlight?,"I am amazed with all the features this unit has, it doesn't have storage for the AC power cord. It is as big as a house which I don't mind but no storage for power cord? Also there is no back light on tuner, it is impossible to see without a flashlight or well lit room. Kinda defeats the purpose of mobile music. I am happy with the sound and overall performance. It would be perfect with some small inexpensive tweaks."
4,The base sound is a bit too heavy or distorted.,"I generally enjoy this boombox. The main feature that sold it to me is the tape player, I want to listen to my old tapes. It also comes with a dedicated input for MP3 devices. The price is very reasonable. The sound is great but not the best, it is powerful enough to fill a large area. The only issue that bothers me is that the bass boost makes the low notes distorted, so I don't use it. I don't know if the cheaper model also has the MP3 dedicated connection, because if it does then it is very much worth to get the cheaper model since the bass boosting feature on this model is not worth using.The keys that one presses to play-pause-forward, could use better labeling, they are hard to read/see because they have the same color as the plastic (all black), therefore, until the keys and their locations are memorized then one has to spend a few extra seconds trying to locate the button one needs."
4,sony boombox,I love the great sound that this boombox produces. I loaded the box with 8 D batteries and take it wherever.
5,good!,"I was just nosing around online with a tax refund burning in my pocket and planning to get something stereo at Wallmart or Supertarget where I could get my hands on it and hear it in person. I obviously had price and value in mind and my older stereo was pretty much petered out. So I found the Sony Xplode and didn't really pay that much attention until I read the reviews. The reviews were almost uniformly good and I'd had Sony before and I knew I could trust the brand. So I took a little bit of a chance and bought the boomer, shelled out a little xtra and got the sucker the next day! Son of a gun is one heck of a deal. Sounds super good for the bucks! Design is cool and looks METAL! When I first heard Broke Down On the Brazos by ZZ Top I KNEW that I had NOT been ripped off! Lady GAGA also blew my doors off. Since I listen mostly to jazz off the radio and enjoy classical music as well I know I've gotten a great all round device. CD and cassette work fine. I'd suggest this stereo to ANYBODY!"
4,I got two -- slight problem of CD cover is hard to get closed. My finger dexterity problem may be the issue.,"I ordered two at the exact same time.One perfect, the other the lid on the CD when you punch it down didn't always easily pop up like it's supposed to -- but with repeated effort it would.I love the HUGE bass.I just wish these modern boom boxes had microphone input, instead of iPod stuff.Also, for the price I could get a Memorex 4 - some, i.e. cd, cassette , fm / am, and lp."
2,Sony Boom Box,"Was looking for a radio that plays tapes and CDs. Got this huge thing I wasn't counting on, but it works except that it eats cassette tapes and is a bit bigger than I'd planned just for moving around from room to room. Plus it's pretty ugly to look at. But the sound is OK."
3,Sony CFDG700CP Boombox,"It's ok, not the best. To read the LCD screen you need glasses or a magnified glass. The boombox does have a nice shape to it and it holds 8 'D Batteries'.And it's a big mothur!"
3,Radio as Big as Me,"I bought this item to use in a Halloween Parade. I never looked at its measurements until I received it. When I saw it, I returned the radio right away. It was as big as me - no way I could carry it. I cannot judge anything about the radio working since I never used it."
3,"It's ""Disposibale"" I guess... it did'nt last 6 months... :(","I enjoyed this unit for 6 months... then it made a loud ""Pop!"", and that's it... it's dead :(It sounded good while it lasted."
4,Good bang for the buck,"I've bought 3 of these units. The unit is reliable and the sound level (20W) is adequate for many applications but won't do well when trying to play music/voice for more than 50 to 60 people. It just doesn't have the power. It's also kinda bulky, but it's very inexpensive for a 20 Watt unit. We're going with the Behringer EPA150 for our larger dance classes. But this unit works pretty well for up to 40 or 50 dance students. Consider other units that have 40+ watts if you really want more power (but they'll cost $200 for the RVNB52 from JVC at 40 Watts; or $300 for the EPA150 from Behringer at 150 Watts)."
2,Great Sound but Bad Tuner,"After reading reviews of several boomboxes, I decided on the sony because it was noted as having great sound and it had a remote. But when it arrived, I quickly discovered that the tuner was lacking. Very strong stations came in fine but most did not. Of the 6 or so stations I listen too, only one was clear. I tried my MP3 player next and found that the volume dropped considerably even with the MP3 player turned up to max. The box sounded great when playing CDs but the poor tuner is a big problem.I purchased a Milwaukee job site radio (2790-20) to replace the sony and it performs much better. It tuned in all the stations I wanted with no problem and it pumps out the sound. No CD player but it has a weather tight compartment for holding an MP3 player which works well and also has a USB port for charging the player."
2,cheaply made,"I bought this boombox for my boyfriend's birthday. He tried it for 15 minutes, and asked me if it was possibple to return it. First of all, the cassette tape ""play"" button [he was most excited about, because he had a box full of old tapes he wanted to listen to] wouldn't stay down when pressed. The sound is pretty mediocre, and the whole thing is very ""plasticky"" and cheaply made. Luckily, Amazon makes it really easy to return items for a full refund."
2,Too heavy for us,We are a small female dance group who needed a player to play our music in small halls. The loudness was great but this is a large and heavy product.We would have great difficulty transporting the item.Too bad - had great sound.
1,Terrible quality -- stopped playing CDs after 3 months,"This product has very nice sound quality for a boombox in this price range... but sadly the CD player stopped working after about 3 months. Now, none of my CDs work in this player (the LCD display says ""NO DISC""). All these CDs work fine in other players, and they used to work in this player a week ago. I've tried cleaning the lens but still doesn't work. This unit has been well cared for and only used about once a week.I always associated Sony with long-lasting products, but I'll be spending my money elsewhere in the future. Products should last more than 3 months. Looks like it will cost me $29 plus shipping to Sony to get the item replaced with a working one."
4,Sony Boombox model CFDG700CD,"It is big, loud, sounds good and easy to operate. It pulls in hard to get programs I could not get before. I would much prefer dials instead of pushbuttons but they seem to work OK."
5,Great boombox,"Bought this for cheerleaders to practice with and also hook up to an ampliflier. It works great for football games and pep-rallies. It is taken to out-of-town games. I do not take ampliflier to out-of-town games, because most quest football sides do not have electricity. Works well for school and fight song. Just wish it had just a tad more volume for those out-of-town games. Great over all and great wolfer!"
1,Great for a while,"Used it off and on for a little over a month, always inside. Sound is great. But now it has started to give off a smell of burning plastic. Gives me a headache to be in the same room when its switched on. The player is not particularly hot anywhere on the outside. Bought it because it had the best Amazon reviews. Lots of junk for sale these days. I would pay more for something good but where to find it?"
2,Sony Boombox,Unfortunately the unit was defective. The center bass speaker distorted at mid volume levels and above.Sony quickly provided a refund.
5,Sony Boombox review,"Luv this product,has awesome highs and lows to bring out the best of all music. I use it while cooking on grill or small social gatherings. Little heavy for using in the small bathroom while i shower... Luv to plug my ipod thru the aux plug and listen to my variety of music... 5 stars.."
5,Real nice,"I've owned a couple other Sony portables through the years and I know this is by far the nicest one I've ever heard. It's the priciest one but you get what you pay for. I wanted a richer sound than the $70 unit I owned before. (That one took a ride off a counter and didn't work so well after that!) So I upgraded. You can tailor the sound. I listen to a lot of live recordings and sometimes you want maximum bass & other times you can take it back a notch or two. It sounds very good and full at low volumes too. Also, I've read that some people don't care for the tape player. I'm 53 years old and still have a large cassette collection so what's not to like? It's a bit heavy and big. You probably won't take it on a canoe camping trip. 5 stars for this unit. You won't be disappointed."
4,Better Sound than Expected,"I really wasn't expecting this to be as loud as it is. Overall a very good boombox. I like that it has an input cord. Very nice when hooking up my ipad, ipod, iphone, or any other device as an Aux. It's super heavy though and this puppy does take up a lot of weight. I wish they'd made a place to wrap the power cord."
5,Sony CFDG700CP CD Radio Cassette Recorder Boombox,"This boombox has the bass we were hoping for. The item is a bit boxy, and the bass visually identified by a red light, however the bass is there which is what we wanted. It is not beautiful to behold, but the audio is sooooogood, its worth the unusual looks and bulkiness. Amazon and Sony came through for us again."
4,Mighty Thump,I bought this boombox as a replacement for my computer speakers that I use with my television. It thumps real nice. The highs on this beast are somewhat higher than I think they ought to be. The equalizer solves this problem pretty well. It needs just a little more mid range in my opinion. It is nice and loud though. Good for a basement or a singe mid sized room. I am very pleased. At 114 bucks its a steal.
4,Good Box for ~$150,"It's big and super ugly, but for the money you can't do much better soundwise. The woofer is nothing but muddy on it's max setting, and the bass is totally absent when off. Some singing voices are distorted even at moderate volume levels. Having said that, the thing still sounds pretty good for what it is, just understand that it is a boombox and not a high fidelity audio system.I do not have a clue why they would put a cassette player in the thing. They need to remove it and install a USB connection for reading MP3s directly off a thumb drive. It does do MP3s from a CD and also via the line input, but a USB input would be so much the better."
5,This is the bomb!,"This is a power-packed boombox! It rocks out better than the JVC mini stereo I got (which has 70 watts of power). Although I think the red is a bit undesirable (to me), I can only give this thing a 5-star rating. It works great and is really awesome! A++++"
3,Too expensive,"The plecos liked the algae wafers, but their were very few of them in the package. Also, the shipping cost more than the product. It was too much money for what I got. I got some advise from the internet and am feeding them squash. They love it and it is cheap."
4,A serious examination of our busy world,"I wasn't exactly sure what to expect when I picked up this book. I figured it would be primarily a work of parody or satire, but I was surprised to find that it is actually quite serious (but still witty and whimsical - definitely not a boring academic tome). Overall the book has a strong libertarian - almost anarchist - theme as it rails against nearly all forms of authority, from government to employers. It is an interesting and somewhat inspiring read for anyone unsatisfied with our workaholic culture and the unhappiness and dissatisfaction it creates.I do have one complaint, which is why I gave the book four stars instead of five: All too often the author goes on with a subject when he has already covered it adequately. I found finishing the book to be a bit of a chore because it wore me down. But it was still fun and interesting to read, and it has helped refine my perspective about the role of leisure in our lives."
3,A wealth of inspiring ideas,"This book contains a lot of great ideas which inspired me. There are, however, some chapters which I don't agree with (e.g. how to avoid going to work, smoking). The kindle version has unfortunately quite some typos (ci becomes repeatedly d). But overall this book is a good read."
3,I'm not impressed,"I expected to be amused and for Mr. Hodgkinson to offer an unusual appraisal of the working life, and the book certainly delivered, at least in the beginning. However, about half way through, Tom began to repeat himself. the same themes over and over. the same oppressors. all of it written from the viewpoint of a male wanker Brit. the celebration of smoking and drinking deflates the overall thesis of rebelling against the ""striving"" lifestyle. these activities are simply self-destructive, selfish acts that the rest of us; taxpayers, friends, and family members have to pay for. no thanks, Mr. Hodgkinson. you fail."
3,It's ok...,"This book covers the milestones, but it's pretty standard. There isn't much room to add more personal stuff, like cute things that baby did that aren't super important (pointed at a favorite book, ""talked"" to the cat..) it still makes for a nice gift I guess."
3,Basically a barbie,"There is nothing special about this toy, it's basically a barbie with what I think is an unattractive face. However, my daughter REALLY loves the whole Hannah Montana thing and requested this for Christmas. She plays with it a lot, so the hair is already a tangled mess as is common with most barbies. The clothes are OK, not anything I'd let my daughters actually WEAR, but it did open the opportunity for discussion about what types of clothes are appropriate for what ages. And these outfits are far less offensive than the BRATZ dolls, so I can't complain too much."
3,O.K. but has some problems,"First of all my daughter loves this doll, but I have some problems with it. First of all this dolls panties are painted on which is fine but these are rather small. They are not a thong but theres not a whole lot more there diffently not what my 5 and 7 year old daughters would wear. The other thing is that the leggings on the extra outfit already have a whole in them and we have only had it two days."
2,Panty Raider: What a waste of money,This was a horibble game. All you have to do is take a picture of 3 models in there underware(no nudity in this game). After that the game is done. It took me 5 min. to beat this games. If I would have know this before I bought it I wouldn't have. This is one of the worst games I ever bought.
1,Basically a Hunting Game,"This game is basically the same thing as Deer Avenger or Big Game Hunter, with the main difference being that you are hunting women. You can only move left or right as if you were standing in one place and turning 360 degrees. You then throw out bait to slow down the women, so you can hit them with goop, which you also throw(shoot) at them. The goop dissolves their clothes down to their underwear, and you take a picture. You have 5 min or so to take 3 pictures before aliens blow up the planet. The aliens ran out of victoria secret catalogues or something apparantly. That is basically the entire game. Shoot goop, take picture, etc. If you like hunting games, this might be fun for you, if not STAY AWAY."
1,THIS GAME SUCKS,"I bought this, and i beat it in 10 minutes! It has one level!It's a bunch of crap. They don't even show good femaleshots! All I'm saying is, if you are a guy who has never EVER EVER EVER seen a girl beofre in your life, and if you'll never get any, then buy it. But if you have the web, go look at ONE picture on a porno site for 12 hours, and you'll get the same effect. SHAME ON THE MAKERS AND SHAME ON THE STORE THAT LET ME BUY IT! I WANT MY MONEY BACK! IF I CAN RATE THIS IN NEGITIVE STARTS I WOULD! I HAVE TO GO BECUASE MY MIDDLE FINGER NEEDS IT'S REST FOR MY TRIP TO ""SIMON SHUSTER"" HQ!"
1,Repetitive and boring,"Simon and Schuster should be ashamed for marketing this game -- not because of the content which is marginally titillating -- but because there is no play value. You spend much of your time waiting for your 'targets' to show up and when they do, you throw goop at them to dissolve their clothes so you can photograph them. That's it -- no strategy (a la LS Larry), no fancy 'weapons' (a la Quake, Doom). For more fun, buy Leisure Suit Larry and search for the eggs."
1,Bad Game,This game is very bad. All you do is shoot girls. It is very frusterating because you can't win and even if you do it isn't very good. Don't buy this game!
3,Panty Raider......! It was nothing!,"Man, you know Panty Raider is an easy-piece-of-cake game! All you do is shoot womans with a gun. Takling about nudity(none). I beat this game in like about 15 minutes. Gheesh, this is a total bore!"
1,Waste of money,"This game sucks. And I like most games. You can only move 360 degrees and disolve clothes with goop, then you have to hurry and take a picture of her in her underware. Well it looks more like a tee shirt and panties. Who made this up? There are only three areas to search and You have to wait for the girl to show up before you can do anything. I know first graders who could make a better storyline."
1,this game sucks,i bought it because it was cheap. shipping was more than the game. it still wasn't worth it.
1,Stupid Game!,"Dear To whom It may concern,If yo have this game do you think is boring? Well....I do. The possible motive I think this game is boringbecause you take pictures of girls in their pantys.You get bored after 5 minutes of playing.This isa total bore.------AbigailPS.- DONT BUY THIS GAME!"
1,AN HONEST REVIEW,I would like to give gamers an honest review on this game.this is the sickest game i have ever bought and it will frustate u to hell cause u will have lots of expectations seeing the box of this game.the graphics are ok but what sense does this game make.i dont want to tell anybody why not to but this game in detail but just tell them to stay away from this game.how could one even release such a boring game(let alone make it).
3,It was ooookkkkaaaaayyy,"It was immature. It was dumb. It got pretty boring after a while. But the immutable fact is, this is a fun game. Buy it, if you are an immature, social outcast like myself."
3,Funny,This game is very funny. If you like parody and comedy games (something like Leisure Suit Larry) then you will LOVE panty raider! From the moment you begin you're intriged with it's use of sarcasm for humor and it's a great game! 3 Stars!
1,Un juego Simple,"Particularmente pienso que es bastante aburrido y muy simple, este es un juego de un solo día. No gaste su dinero en un juego de este tipo."
5,A must reading,"On this book Dr Sproul, using its excellent teaching style, explains what Jesus was teaching in its famous speech in Mathew 24. For those who are interested in biblical eschatology, this reading is a must. It not only presents the preterits view, but also mentions others point of view to help the reader to have a macro view of the different positions held about the last time events as found in the Bible."
3,A Mediocre Summary of Preterism,"Sproul was disappointing here in this work. His book reads more like a compilation rather than a work expressing his own views. In fact, he never clearly identifies what his own view is. One would guess that he is a preterist, but he never articulates it. To Sproul's credit, he holds a very high view of the authority of Scripture. He also tries to summarize accurately other viewpoints besides preterism.Sproul's work is helpful for an overview of preterism... ""The Last Days According to Jesus"" is a book I would recommend for others to borrow, but not to buy. Perhaps the greatest strength of this work is the additional credibility given to preterism by Sproul's integrity and prominence."
3,"Good book, needs to be more comitted though......","I thought the book was good if the object was to make the reader educated to a Preterist stand point of view. However, I was disapointed in that I believed that Dr. Sproul would take a more concrete position as to the Partial or Full Preterist view. Also, the work of Russell's The Parousia was critiqued as well. I was not conviced in my own mind that Russell was in error as Dr. Sproul was maybe trying to prove. M. Smith Hilliard, Ohio"
5,a Christian's perspective,"I enjoyed this book very much and am now very persuaded towards partial-preterism (a view which I would off the top of my head summarize some of the New Testament prophecy has already been fulfilled as determined by context and external evidence from history). Sproul makes me realize how ignorant most Christians are of ancient history! If you're not familiar with the rational biblical thinking of R.C. Sproul, then you've been missing out! The book he recommends most of his is ""the holiness of God""...I thought it was terrific."
3,Borrow the book -- don't buy it!,"Our church was going through the video course (of the same name) that Dr. Sproul made and I picked up the book for background information. If you have a problem with the idea of the great tribulation, final judgment, etc and would like for someone to give you some rather suger-coated reasons for believing it all happened in AD 70 in the destruction of Jerusalem, then this book is for you. Though Dr. Sproul never really comes out and says it, his book is firmly grounded in the preterist view and gives fairly short shrift to other viewpoints. Dr. Sproul is a good writer and you will firm up your own beliefs in refuting his presentation but I think your time could be better spent."
3,Never really specific with his own opinions,"I read Gentry's book (Just Before Jerusalem Fell) before this one so this book came across to me as a review of Gentry's views on Preterism, and also those of Russell, more so than Sproul's. It is an informative book that reads well, however. Anyone just looking into the Partial Preterist position on eschatology might very well enjoy it as it is informative."
4,Last Days,Fascinating take on Matthew 28 and Revelation that deals with some often overlooked or glossed over passages that believers should deal with. Lots of quotes from other scholars.
3,Disappointed,"While this book has lots of great information and the author is very scholarly I do NOT like books written in this format. About 45-55% of the book is composed of quotes from other authors. A couple of the authors he quotes at GREAT length. My feeling is if I wanted to read what those other writers had to say I would buy their books. I wanted to hear what RC Sproul had to say and instead all I got in this book is the echo of other writers rather than the authors own thoughts and ideas.Every author is going to have ""some"" quotes from other writers to help reinforce their message, but half the book? That is going too far in my opinion."
2,weakest of all of sproul's books (not just because of its prespective),"I subscribed to Table Talk (Sproul's magazine) for 10 years. I have read most of his books. This is the only one of his I would not give 4 or 5-stars.Its not so much that I disagree with his conversion to postmillenialism and moderate preterism (though I do). It is more the lack of balance. He is usually pretty fair to his opponents, but not here. He quotes a very strident postmillennialist for his description of all four views! Then he has a chart where he classified Calvin and Augustine as postmil.!! Nobody credible does that. Maybe he could make a case for this, but being that it is an extreme minority judgment, he should at least try to justify it.Very sad. The ONLY book of Sproul's I would not recommend to others. His concerns seem to be apologetic -- how can we hold to the authority of Matt. 24 unless we say that Jesus DID return in some sense in 70AD? But in his zeal he seems to discard his usual precision and balance."
4,Nice Album,"Years ago, I used to buy batches of CD's on eBay, usually to get one or two that I really wanted and usually at a very cheap final price. I suspect that is how I came to own this CD. Every once in a while, a batch would yield a hidden nugget, and that is definitely the case with Jigsaw People. I don't know what Mr. Frenay is doing now, but back in 1996 he was writing and performing this little gem, filled with catchy songs and exemplary performances, both vocally and instrumentally. It most certainly won't be for everyone, but is nice light entertainment and is a pleasant surprise every time it comes up in my rotation. Nice work, Gary!"
4,BANNER AMERICAN LAMINIATES,"I like the way this laminator eases copies through, and gives a nice smooth appearance. I was surprised that a carrier was not necessary. I am anxious to learn about using foil on projects. As an added plus by calling the company directly helped to answer my questions. They were helpful, courteous and gave excellent customer service."
1,Maxell CD-R 1 pack,"I thought I was gettinga bargain. The picture shows a package with 10 on it. All I got was one CD disk. with mailing costs, it was NOT what I bargained for."
3,MRS. GADDY AND THE GHOST,TOOK OVER A MONTH TO RECEIVE THE BOOK. WAS NOT IN AS GOOD OF SHAPE ANDI EXPECTED.
5,Lovely novel..,"this was a wonderful little tale! i absolutely loved it. But its true, the real killer is not a big surprise as probably the author intended.. nevertheless it was a sweet enjoyable read. My only regret is that there wasn't an epilogue that landed Collin and Sydney with a child or a wedding or something to that effect (sorry, but you can call me a hopeless, sappy romantic and i would take it as a compliment! hehe)."
5,WOW! Even Better Than Her FIrst,"I loved Ms. Herron's first Intrigue, but ""Her Eyewitness"" is even better. It grabbed me on the first page and never let up. Great Job!"
3,teach yourself programming,That's exactly what is written on the cover. It's a good book for the people who know noting about programming and want to enter in this exiting field. The book is well written and gives you good idea about computer programming and teach you to program in Liberty Basic Which not the best choice from my point of view but it's free.
1,No software included,I purchased this to read when I went away and while I was reading on the plane out the book said to do some exercise using the disk??? It was an ebook no disk included. Someday I'll look at it again to see if there is someway to use the ebook without the disk.
1,A horrible book,"This book gives you an introduction to the different programming languages. It also provides a very good source of information. However, if you have never typed code before, and you want to learn, this book is definetly not your best option. Also, this book does not come with an application that helps you create games. It only gives you the concept/logic behind game making. What good is that if you can not put it to use???"
4,begining programming,"I would recommend this book for beginers, It explains the basics of programming, and also starts you off in java , c or c++ , although you do need the compilers for c and c++.and also ultimatediscountbooksource@yahoo.com shipped it quickly and I had the book within a week."
5,To learn how to program you need this book !!!,"This is the best ( if not only !) book that teachs you the methods of programming . It tells you how to program as well as the basics of other programming languages ( QBASIC , VISUAL-BASIC , C , C++ and JAVA ). I recommend it to anyone who whats to write programs !!!"
1,"""Like stirring cement with your eyelashes""",Ready to throw this book out the window. It seems to have been written by and for the 30-year veteran of Civil Procedure. It should not be used as an introductory text to any 1st year Civil Procedure course.
5,Great,"Dear Bobby:Wonderful reading! I did not skip a word. I would love to join you when you travel to visit your roots. I have met folks from that area in my travels and found them to be hard working,warm loving folks. Your so called cousins ""Mac Masters"" Delivered meals on wheels and many other charitable acts of kindness to the elderly. Lonnie and Lollie are very special people. I would love to be there when the strawberries are ripe,they tell me they are the best. They also have Harness Racing and I have met several in my travels around the different tracks that came from there. You have shared a remarkable relationship with Nana and can look back with great pride that you made her life happier because of your unselfish devotion and love. Thanks for sharing. Love to you and Sue Bob"
3,Corrected track list,"Track list is not correct. Here is the correct one:1. A Hard Day's Night - Supremes2. Eleanor Rigby - Four Tops3. We Can Work It Out - Wonder, Stevie4. Hey Jude - Temptations5. Yesterday - Gaye, Marvin6. Long and Winding Road, The - Ross, Diana7. Come Together - Supremes8. She's Leaving Home - Syreeta9. You Can't Do That - Supremes10. Fool on the Hill, The - Four Tops11. Michelle - Four Tops12. And I Love Her - Robinson, Smokey &13. Something - Martha Reeves & The Vandellas14. Let It Be - Gladys Knight & The Pips15. Imagine - Diana Ross16. My Love - Walker, Jr.17. My Sweet Lord - Starr, Edwin"
3,Vintage Motown Can Never be Bad,"Although I was very disappointed with a couple of the covers (the Temptations' ""Hey Jude"" and the Four Tops' ""Eleanor Rigby""), I'd still recommend this CD for folks who miss the good ol' days of Motown ... artists we love, singing some of the greatest songs ever written."
5,Great compilation of Beatles covers,"In the sixties and early seventies, it was common practice to include plenty of cover versions on albums, and Motown were no exception. Seventeen of the best Beatles covers by Motown acts (including three songs from after the break-up) were brought together in this fascinating collection.Nearly all the songs are classics. You can't do that, from one of the Beatles early album, is by far the least well known. Some of the songs are more true to the originals than other, but among the more distinctive are Eleanor Rigby, sung with real feeling by the Four Tops, and Yesterday, which Marvin Gaye was obviously determined to make his version different from the hundreds of others, and succeeded brilliantly.While many of these tracks are available elsewhere, it is great to have them all together. If you enjoy either Beatles tribute albums or sixties Motown, you will enjoy this too. If, like me, you enjoy both, this is essential."
5,A Must Have,"The other reviews here almost do this collection justice--however no one has mentioned the piece de resistance: Syreeta's ""She's Leaving Home"". It is fabulous, with Stevie Wonder's genius (and back-up singing, I believe) all over it. It is a pre-cursor to those mid-'90's hip-hop tracks with synth-voice harmonies; way ahead of its time. In addition, Marvin Gaye's ""Yesterday"" is heartbreaking and gorgeous; Jr. Walker's ""My Love"" (ok, it's a Wings song, but why quibble?) is makeout music heaven; and the Supremes are actually not bad on ""You Can't Do That"" (their ""Hard Days Night"" is rather painful, but it's the first track and you get over it quickly!)Highly recommended."
2,ITS OKAY!,I JUST LISTEN TO SOME SAMPLES OF MOTOWN MEETS THE BEATLES ITS OKAY I LIKE STEVIE WONDER VERSION OF WE CAN WORK IT OUT THE OTHERS I DIDN'T LIKE I LIKE THE BEATLES SINGING THEM!FROM KIRSTEN
3,Brief Overview of the Service of the First Virginia Infantry,"Facsimile reprint of the original 1884 edition, this book is a brief overview of the service of the regiment, focusing primarily on its movements and casualties. Very little in the way of anecdotes, which is unfortunate, because the few that are included, though brief, really add life to the narrative. In total, the actual essay on the regiment consists of only about 50 pages, the rest being an introduction to the reprinted edition and a roster. The latter consists of name, company, year the soldier joined the regiment, duration of service, and fate; soldiers are listed alphabetically. In its day, the book served its purpose as a brief record for aging members of the regiment of their former triumphs and struggles, but for modern readers leaves much to be desired."
2,Unsure,"Falling is about a naiive gullible boy called Lucas who is struggling with life. Throughout the novel it is found that Lucas is falling through adolecence as opposed to ascending through life. Lucas is targetted by facist and racist neo nazis who use their swarmy persuasive skills to break his innocence and send him in a downward spiral. As the title cleverly suggests, this is a novel about falling through life, falling in love, and falling apart. The novel pays attention to both Lucas' past and present in order for Lucas to continue through his growing up process. His mixed emotions reflect his regret to many of his adolecnt actions, making the story both frustrating and exciting for the reader."
5,one of the all time great shows,"I feel this is one of the all time great television shows...and too forgotten....I had not really seen much of the show, for 40 years, until the DVD's came out....in my opinion, the show was perfectly cast, very well directed, the actors did a first rate job, and the shows were a perfect blend of drama, emotion and comedy...but the show was not a true comedy...I would say only 30% comedy/70% drama...but the show certainly stirs the emotions...and after 40 years I was especially impressed with Jane Wyatt and how fine an actress she really was (which I had not really noticed when I was young)...all the episodes are great...but ""Betty's birthday"" from season 3 and ""Margarets premonition"" from season 2 really got to me...I highly recommend the whole dvd season 1-3 package and hopefully seasons 4-6 will come out soon...this was a tv show everyone should see"
3,Good show,"One thing I like about this show is that no one is perfect in it. But, why did they make Betty so stupid? And why doesn't Kathy get disciplined for her behavior? Kathy apparently doesn't respect her parents and does what she wants. Margaret is a slave, I like this show, but I wouldn't want kids like that in my house, LOL."
1,So disappointed!,"When I couldn't even get the screw to turn in order to open the battery compartment, I knew I was in trouble! I had 2 others try as well, but to no avail.Everything else appeared to be just fine but it's hard to rate the light's performance when you can't turn it on! Others had mentioned this problem in reviews but I thought, ""This won't happen to me!"" But, it did. I sent it back. Come on Rayovac, let's fix this problem!"
1,It looked like a great idea,"It looked like a great idea, but I had to send it back. I could not get the battery case open. There was a tiny screw holding it closed and nothing I did worked to get it to move."
3,Not quite as good as I had hoped,"I find that the light put out by this device is a bit too bright and harsh in a fairly concentrated spot, then the light quickly falls off past the center, bright spot. That makes for a very glary, uneven illumination that doesn't make for easy reading of a book. You have to keep shifting the book to center the spot on the area you are reading. And, if you're reading a glossy magazine, the reflection off the page is terrible. The old incandescent bulb, in my view, is far superior to the LED bulbs here."
1,Might be okay but . . .,"I was so anxious for this purchase to arrive so I could read in bed. But, alas, after struggling with the tighter than Fort Knox plastic enclosure it was packaged in (and very nearly slicing my finger to the bone on the sharp edges) the next obstacle was installing batteries. No luck since the battery chamber door has been secured with a teensy, tiny Phillips head screw. No matter how hard I try, I CANNOT get this little teeny screw to loosen. And I am using the teeny, tiniest set of screw drivers. It is beyond my ability to comprehend why the manufacturer found it necessary to secure a little plastic battery compartment door with a screw. OVERKILL. I will have to see if I can impose on a big, strong, husky he-man with super power to remove the screw so I can put in the batteries. Unless you are prepared to deal with this huge inconvenience DON'T bother buying this reading light. If I am able to get the batteries installed, I will update this review."
1,??? Screw is impossible to unscrew without stripping.,"After all the positive reviews, I ordered this light. I was never even able to get the screw out to open the battery compartment! It completely stripped when I used a small screwdriver. I had to return it. :("
4,We're both happy now!,"We had the same issue others had, light on reading bothering my husband. Allows enough light to cover both pages on even large hardbacks.Not so small it's difficult to use. It's durable, I have dropped it several times - no problem!This is a good product. Thanks again to Amazon! Without this service, I would never have gone shopping for a book light. We are very rural, gas is very dear, just don't shop for simple things like this. I needed one...every night adjusting the light so it wouldn't bother him - that gets really old. Now we're both happy!!"
3,"Had to ""damage"" it to open battery compartment","I agree with other reviewers that the screw on the battery compartment stripped immediately. However I really needed a good hands-free light, so I used my tools (small screwdriver-like thing that had a point on the end) to chisel open the hole where the screw was. After that I could open the battery compartment, and latch it. So now the light is usable, and just great! I purchased and modified 4 of them -- gave one as gift (warned the recipient that it looks damaged after my modification), and have the others in separate rooms. If it it didn't have that screw defect, I'd give it 6 stars! It's so convenient and inexpensive, lightweight, and even has extra controls to direct the light up/down."
2,Disappointing,"Bouyed by other reviews, I purchased the Rayovac hands free reading light to take on a six day trip. It islight weight and easy to transport and wear. However, I am very disappointed in two aspects:1) the quality of the light - it is quite uneven across a book page2) ability to direct the angle - can't angle it low enough to read book while lying in bed.I will continue to use until I find something better."
1,Not the seller's fault this product is awful,I ordered a reading light -- it arrived on time and in perfect condition. I have no beef with the seller at all.But the product is a real loser -- don't order a Rayovac hands-free reading light!It comes with a battery compartment that has to be unscrewed before you can install the batteries. The screw is so tiny I have yet to find a way to open the compartment! Can't use the product without batteries.I'm bummed.
1,Had to return it - battery cover won't open,"I agree with some other reviewers that the screw on the battery cover is an overkill, and in our case, its demise.I was looking forward to use this for night-time diaper change. However, when we received the product, we simply could not open the battery cover. The screw was really tight, and from the look of it, not made of sturdy metal, and after several trials, it was chipped. So I can not speak for how the product would work since we didn't have a chance to use it.Return with Amazon was easy, though. Click a few buttons, get a pre-paid return shipping label, and drop off at your local UPS store.Replacement was not available for this product, so we opted for a refund. I am debating whether to order this again, hoping we won't get a defective product this time, or go for a different product ..."
2,NOT the best book light out there,I purchased this light several years ago. It is a little heavy and any movement sends it sliding to one side or the other. It also did not hold up well and broke after a couple of months. The best book lights are by Might Brite. A little more expensive but well worth it. I have two and plan on purchasing more for Christmas GIfts.
5,A knitting bag must,"Like the other reviewer I also use this light for knitting in the dark. It works beautifully, I have no problem what so ever seeing my stitches. This is a must have for every knitting/crochet bag."
4,Worked in 2002 Liberty,"Not much to say, this worked in a 2002 Liberty and replaced the factory radiator that was leaking rapidly. It does not seem to be quite as thick walled as the original radiator, but it installed and has shown no signs of malfunction since installing over 5 months ago."
5,"""klak is crunked for christ""",IF YOU LIKE LIL JON AND SCARFACE YOU'LL LIKE KLAK'S DEBUT ALBUM. IT WILL KEEP YOU KRUNKED!!!!
5,Easy install,"I hated actuallly buying these because I could have bought a new hand truck at HD for the same cost. I thought it was risky that they would fit. Anyhow, perfect fit, easy install in a few minutes. Now, I feel like I have a 'run flat' hand truck. Hopefully my last hand truck."
2,Don't start here,This book is probably not the best introduction to Buddhism. I would definitely try to find another if you are beginning your exploration of Buddhist thought.
5,HILARIOUS MOVIE,"THIS MOVIE WAS ONE OF THE FUNNIEST IVE EVER SEEN! JERRY LEWIS IS ONE OF THE TWO FUNNIEST ACTORS I KNOW OF! I ROLLED. EVERY FRIDAY I WENT TO THE VIDEO STORE TO GET IT. I FINALLY HAD TO BUY IT. I STRONGLY RECOMMEND IT. I AM 14 YEARS OLD, A 14 YEAR OLD LIKES A BLACK AND WHITE MOVIE, WHAT DOES THAT TELL YOU?"
2,Did not receive what I ordered,"Did not receive what I ordered, similar product, but just NOT the same thing. I was charged for the product I ordered, which was lower, and since I was so late for the Holiday, I had no choice but to keep it."
3,there should be some way to lock it in place,". the screw drivers open and if you keep your keys in your purse, you might get jabbed. I find it annoying that they open.. there should be some way to lock it in place"
4,Exquisite Jazz Performance,"Ed Bickert has an exquisite sense of timing and harmony. Although the song selection is sometimes not contemporary, his execution of the jazz idiom is impeccable. I would recommend this to anyone who loves tasteful jazz guitar. Mr. Bickert is the ambassador for this style."
2,very cheaply made,"when ireceived it , the C in cowboys was missing and all the blue under the bill was peeling off. I like the colors but i would not buy this again"
1,do not buy,i received this visor in the mail and the rubber was peeling off do not waste your time and money on this product
2,Expected More,Has some very good elements of introductory material but is lacking a lot of content. For $20+ I was expecting a lot more considering I ordered a similar book with much more information for $8.
3,Should have another .....,"It is a good reference book to understanding the basic concept of audio speaker. But it should have another version to tell more and deeper theoretical terms of speaker structure. Such as the detail of all equations relating to the technical terms Q(ts), Vas...., difference material(wood) and shape structure for speaker box. How to choose and match difference driver unit....etcI hope this continuous version will come later on."
3,sometimes incoherent,"From what I can tell, Murphy published this book himself, without the help of an editor or even a proofreader. He spells about as well as an engineer, and sentences are often missing verbs or other helpful grammatical signposts.Yes, the book digests physics and EE quickly and easily enough for the beginner, but more often than not it serves as nothing more than an advertisement for Murphy's $130 speaker-design software. This isn't a bad idea, really, but the book is only 166 pages long, and not all of it is meat.If you want to get an idea of what his software project is like, visit trueaudio.comOverall it's a nice book, but don't expect to use this as a standalone bible for building speakers; it's more of an addition to your library."
3,An introduction to the world of loudspeakers,"This book gives the basics of loudspeaker and basic filter design. The types and basic formulations besides the history. If you are new to the subject and still haven't decided to pick loudspeaker building as a hobby or not, this book can give you a broad idea about what is happening inside the world of loudspeakers. The language is simple and easy to follow. The sections are well organized. There are no in depth explanations that can scare the beginners away. A good collection of simple questions and answers like; where should I place the port or SPL, Size and Bass relation. I think the book covers all the common questions that beginners are afraid to ask."
1,Drips Boiling Water!,Cute teapot but all cutness goes out the door when boiling water dribbles out the spout onto your hand! Spout is very poorly designed.
1,Cute but non-functional,"I liked the novel idea of this kettle and was so delighted when I found it. However it didn't take long for this cow kettle to spring it's leaks. The kettle leaks all over the place and is poorly made. The pour spout cow head leaks not only near the opening but all around the cow head as well. No matter how careful I was in handling it, it didn't seem to matter. The leaks continued. It's got a nice whistle in it but then I was always afraid to pour from it--not what I wanted. I was very dissappointed in this kettle and would never get another one."
4,Funny and realistic,This book is funny and realistic! Thanks for bring otherwise taboo subjects about military life to light.
5,A brave look into life's journey,"I thought this book was a courageous book to write. The subject matter has very sensitive and personal material in it, yet through humor it relinquishes a great message for not only military spouses, but to all wives/partners whose life partner's career manages their lives. Being an Officer's wife of 8 years, and a prior enlisted dependent of 21 years, the message I took to heart was that I don't always have to be so strong. It's ok to have doubts and weaknesses; and also it's acceptable to not always have a pretense of a perfect marriage. This book seem to look at one's journey and challenge to attain personal growth and how even though freindships are essential, it's the individual person who actually has to decide to grow or not. A person's journey out reaches rank, job titles, or financial background; I believe the message has helped me in my own journey of personal growth which continues daily."
4,good for sarah!,"I totally disagree with the ""navy spouse"" who slammed sarah's book...i think it took a lot of guts to share with the world the worst of oneself in such an honest and revealing way...sarah started her experience as a navy wife and mother as an unknowing victim of her own circumstances and fought through her doubts and fears to emerge a stronger, more self confident young woman...i learned some things about myself from reading this...even at my age of 58...i laughed and i cried..particularly when she lost her precious dog...i can relate...i am sure that she and her husband have emerged a stronger and more devoted couple...it was a hard road and they both chose to take it...my hats off to sarah smiley"
5,Fabulous read!,"This book made me laugh out loud, and it made me cry! You have to have experience as a military wife / girlfriend/ significant other to share Sarah's insight. I have recommended it to all my military spouses in our squadron and have even loaned it out!"
1,Waste of my time,"I am a Navy wife and I do NOT want Sarah Smiley representing me. She is weak, selfish, lazy and childish. She is a CO wife's nightmare!!! If she wants to write books - fine - leave Navy wives out of it. This was a waste of my time."
3,Explores growing-up of sheltered military wife,I wasn't sure if this book was autobiographical or semi-autobiographical however I found the main character/author whiny. I admired her journey and growth to be more independent and empowered but I found her overall incredibly selfish. There were a few laughs in the story; I identified with a few funny things I have done too while my husband has been deployed. Most of all I admire the husband in this story who gave his permission to the wife/author to write about very personal aspects of their relationship. At least the author had the courage to be honest about herself throughout the book; that's what kept me involved in this book from beginning to end. Easy quick read.
5,NOT a military wife,"As someone who does not relate to this book in an obvious, personal manner, I did enjoy the book for it's honesty and the author's willingness to share her flaws and insecurities. I did not get the impression that she is even trying to tell the story of every military wife, but just her own, during a very specific time. Everyone has a story, but few people are talented, tenacious and brave enough to share it. As someone who has no connection to the military, I found it interesting to read about the affects of war on someone at home. I think it is very timely and whether it is a reflection of everyone's experience is irrelevant...it is important for people to realize how much is sacrificed during times of war and maybe this is one way to share that. I highly recommend it."
1,Poor Lil Officer's Daughter & Wife,"This was the worse book I've ever read. I am a military spouse for over 10 years and this author needs to get a grip on life in the ""real military world"". Are we suppose to feel sorry for her life of privilige (daughter of admiral- wife of officer).Wants to have an affair w/her obgyn? Please! Not every spouse wants to cheat on their husband nor have thoughts of it.Sarah needs to add a few more knots or deployments in her rope before she writes another book on being the expert of military life as a spouse. Try going thru 9 deployments in 10 years and tell the reading public what true sacrifice is?Officer spouses have it a bit easier and grandios compared to the enlisted side. I suggest she hang out with her enlisted counterparts and see the other side of the water."
2,This is how military wives get a bad reputation,"Sarah's book made me understand why military wives sometimes have a bad reputation--someone probably read this book instead of getting to know the actual wives. Her infatuation with her Dr during her husband's absence was inexcusable. She did touch of some of the actual stresses we military spouses go through, such as how more things seem to go wrong when the member is gone, but overall, I would be embarrassed to think someone would read this book and see it as a ""real"" picture of a military wife. HOMEFRONT CLUB is WAY better, more helpful to military spouses and more ""real"" for those who want some insight."
5,A Greatly Enjoyed Read,"A friend passed this book along to me, and while I was leery at first, I was thoroughly impressed with Sarah Smiley's account of the partner side of deployment. I am the long-time girlfriend of a military man and have experienced two deployments with him. I could whole-heartedly relate to many of Sarah's experiences and found her description of deployments from the spouse's perspective right on in many respects. What I appreciated most about her book was the humor with which she wrote. Not only was she able to make me, the reader, laugh at her actions and beliefs, but I could tell she was laughing at herself. This author truly has a fine gift of storytelling. Though I thought the book wrapped up and resolved her issues rather quickly, by the end, I found myself wanting to read more by this author about her life. I highly recommend this book, and I hope the author has another out soon."
3,Funny but not hilarious,It was a good read of displaying life as a military wife. I am an army wife but i was able to relate it her adventures an navy wife. It was funny but not hilarious like people made it seem. But all in all i would recommend it. I finished it pretty fast
3,Interesting account,"While I do understand the outrage that other military wives have felt from reading this book, I also understand Sarah Smileys point. I was glad that at the end of the book she did finally find herself. I enjoyed that she wasn't the prim and proper military wife that Hollywood has bombarded our society with. Often the military isn't glamorous and I think it takes a strong woman to put her life out there for others to read and learn from.So I found Ms. Smiley's book to be quite funny and while I would never suggest behaving how she did, I still think it's an interesting read. We all deal with deployments differently and sometimes it's nice to know that there is someone out there who doesn't cope as well as we do."
1,poor misrepresentation,"I am a Navy wife who recently read this book as part of our Wives Club book club. Every single one of us were horrified by Sarah Smiley's representation of military wives as excessively dependent, selfish, ignorant and helpless. We would never, never, never recommend this book to either a new wife entering the ""lifestyle"" or to a civilian who would be interested in learning more about our lives. Mrs. Smiley managed to hit every stereotype about the Wives club further exacerbating all misconceptions. If this is truly an honest account of her behavior and beliefs, she should be ashamed of herself. It's too bad about this book, we were really interested in the subject and looking for a fun read."
2,"Funny, but pathetic.","This book frustrated me to no end. Sarah Smiley is the helpless, hopeless stereotype that I find myself fighting as a military spouse.Most people are capable of balancing their own checkbook and mowing their lawns while their husbands are away. While funny at times, I found most of her experiences pathetic and disturbing. Really? Falling for your OB while your husband is gone?Save yourself the money and embarassment in knowing that this woman calls herself a military wife."
1,this book stunk,"This book was written for idiots! Should be considered a fiction novel. Don't waste your time if you want to read a book about military wives read either ""Under the Sabers"" or ""Home Fires Burning"". This author should stick to writing magazine columns."
5,Brings Back Memories,"I was a military brat along with my four younger siblings starting in WWII and I followed in my Father's footsteps. This book brought back many memories to our family. Most people do not understand the nomadic and some what hectic life of a military family. One time we moved three times in one year from Mass. to Texas to California. The author tells what it is like and gives it the humor it deserves. I would not trade all of the humor, trials and tribulations I went through for two generations for anything. Keep up the good work Sarah Smily. This Vet says thanks for allowing me to relive those years."
4,"Quite good, but doesn't give credit where due","The illustrations are remarkable in this book. However, no where is it mentioned that it's based off the children's song. It is even misleading to make one think the words belong to the author."
4,Smiled !!,"How many times Ive picked up a book about dogs to read, and by the third chapter got bored.......not with this book! I find it charming, funny, USEFUL, and so entertaining! Im not looking for gossip about Movie Stars, I leave that to The GOSSIP Magazines. My interest is in Puppies, and they have more than satisfied that issue. Good luck to you guys, keep up the good work!!!"
1,Good for entertainment only,"I was quite disappointed with this book. Although it has a little good advice, it also contains some glaring misconceptions. For instance, a vegetarian diet was advocated at one point. Dogs are carnivores. They do not need a vegetarian diet. Also, they said not to feed your dog natural bones, unless they were boiled knuckle bones. Raw bones are perfectly acceptable, provided they aren't small enough for your dog to gulp without chewing. Cooked bones of any type become brittle and may splinter, causing terrible damage. For the good of your dog, don't listen to this book."
3,Pretty poor shape,This book was not in very good shape. I was chewed on which was okay I knew that but it has a lot of markings and highlights in it. I was disapointed.
3,Interesting book,"This book is an interesting way to get some of the history of our country. It is well written, but some of the things are a little unbelievable. It came in a reasonable length of time and was in good condition."
4,Tenacious Christmas D,"There are SO MANY Christmas compilations out there, and the radio stations play the same 8 versions of the same songs over and over and over - starting before Halloween! It's amazing I can stand to hear ANY holiday music. However, I bought the album for the Tenacious D track. At least it is an original song with a sense of humor. I'm rockin' with Jabers and Kage this year, and bustin' a gut laughing! Those of you who ""get"" the D should get this CD."
3,Too expensive,Don't know whether I should feel sorry for the editors or mad at them. I'm amazed that there is actually another reviewer. Perhaps he got the book on loan from an academic library. What is the sense of publishing a book that no one will read?There a lot of burmaphiles out here that would be interested if the price were within reason.
1,Extremely disappointing,"The information contained in this book are the same as you can find on the canadian immigration web site. On page ""104"", the auther has written a specimen to demonstrate profiency in English languange if English isn't your first language.That specimen contains loads of grammer errors. Its simply not worth buying it."
4,"Dreamy, relaxed, summery instrumental guitar trio album","""Grasshopper"" is a summery collection of contemporary jazz guitar compositions. Wayne's tone, chops, and composing abilities are all equally and impressively displayed, without shocking or startling the listener. He seamlessly blends jazz, rock, and pop motifs in a lyrical style reminiscent of Pat Metheny yet unique enough to maintain interest. Jimmy Johnson's electric bass tone is also deep and full, interweaving a mesmerizing line with the guitar on the title track. Bill Berg's drums and percussion provide a sympathetic complement throughout.Perfect music to relax and daydream to on a warm summer day."
5,Best pocket knife I have ever owned,"There's just something about this kershaw pocket knife that I love. Maybe it's the perfect size, the super sharp blade, the durability.. whatever it is, I love it! Very solid knife."
5,Kershaw Pocket Knife,"I had owned a Ken Onion ""chive"" but lost it and opted for the larger ""scallion"" It's a wonderful knife .. I prefer serrated blades, seems they get more done or better suit my lifestyle. This knife fits well in my pocket, operates flawlessly, sharp out of the box. I like everything about it. If someone bought me another one exactly like it, I'd be thrilled to have it in a box in my dresser."
4,Make Room for Mascagni in your operatic world!,"Pietro Mascgni is a nineteenth century operatic composer whose works deserve recongnition! Mascagi was a composer whose strength was melody; whose oeuvre was extensive and whose career spanned over half a century. The talented son of humble folks he became famous when his first opera Cavalleria Rusticana made him rich and famous! Like Lord Byron he woke up to find himself famous! Mallach describes the salient plot lines and comments with his musical expertise on all of the many unknown Mascagni operas. Mascagni was much more than a one opera composer. His character was bipolar and he was complex. His affair with his only mistress as well as stormy times with friends and family are given attention. However, the real value of this book is in the details of the maestro's works. Opera fans will relish Mallach's years of research in this first English language biography."
5,For anyone who has thrilled to a Pietro Mascagni opera,"Exhaustively researched and adroitly written by pianist, composer, and independent scholar Alan Mallach, Pietro Mascagni And His Operas is the informative biography of talented Italian opera writer Pietro Mascagni (1863-1945) whose great works include L'Amico Fritz, Guglielmo Ratcliff, Iris, Parisina, and many others. Written with privileged access to Mascagni's 4,200 letters to Anna Lolli, his mistress for more than thirty years, Pietro Mascagni and His Operas is an eye-opening portrait of a man's complex, talented life and his most remarkable music. Pietro Mascagni And His Operas is a welcome and very highly recommended addition to any Music History collection and ""must"" reading for anyone who has thrilled to a Pietro Mascagni opera."
5,tlc's back,"I THINK TLC IS THE BEST GROUP IN THE WORLD. FIRST,THEY MADE US WANNA PARTY ALL NIGHT LONG WITH ""NO SCRUBS"",AFTER THEY GAVE US THE STRENGTH TO FIGHT OUR COMPLEXES WITH ""UNPRETTY"" AND NOW THEY ARE CALMING DOWN THE FLOW WITH A COOLBEAT ,""DEAR LIE"" AS AWESOME AS THE OTHER! THE ADVICE I CAN GIVE IS BUY THE CD! IT'S GREAT AND T-BOZ'S VOICE SWEETS VERY WELL TO THE SONG.GOT TO GET IT!"
3,not what you think,"This book is NOT a biography of Anselm Adams or a ""how-to take your own Anselm Adams-like photos"" DIY. It has minimal biographical information (e.g., only 2 pictures of AA, including the cover photo, no information on his marriage or children, etc.). It does have a lot on the philisophical background of AA and his friends that led them to take and value the kind of images they made and admired, and reproduces many images made by AA and friends. It's a good book for what it is, but before you buy it, make sure that this is what you want."
4,Synopsis of the Material in the Book,"This book is written for use by teachers as an comprehensive introduction to newspaper journalism. Each chapter includes teacher instructions for a wide variety of student activities, as well as several student worksheets. The chapter topics are as follows: Ch. 1 Overview, Ch. 2 News, Ch. 3 Features, Ch. 4 Editorials, Ch. 5 Sports, Comics, and Other Special Features, Ch. 6 Advertising, Ch. 7 Reporting History as News, and Ch. 8 The Newspaper Today (libel, protection of sources, censorship, and other legal/freedom of speech issues). High school teachers might find this well-written resource useful for a newspaper literacy unit in a history or English class, and also for journalism classes and school newspaper staffs."
3,History of the Jehovahs Witnesses.,"This is a history of the jehovahs witnesses written by the witnesses. I covers their early history & development. It also gives reasons to doubt the doctrine of the witnesses, you just need to know where to look. I find it interestering how the doctrine has changed over the years. I guess my favorite parts of the book are the passages about the legal battles they fought in the US courts. All the way up to the supreme court. Many of these cases have also benefitted other religions & groups in the US. An interestering book."
1,"Dishonest title, mediocre content","This book has nothing to do with hyperthreading whatsoever -- nor, as far as I can see, is it particularly specific to Intel processors. The real title would read something like ""A fleet-footed and largely superfluous overview of the basics of multithreading using Windows and Unix API"". Had _that_ been the title, I would have given this book three stars -- it's superfluous, but that aside, OK. But the title is a complete lie, I'm sure intended to make the book look enticing (especially coming from Intel Press, where you'd expect (1) a book to have something to do with their hardware, and (2) an opportunity to take good info from ""the horse's mouth"" as it were). None of it here: one star (as the lowest I can give)."
1,poor,Not much about HT tech even it is by INTEL Press. Just VERY basic contents related to parallel programming.The article on Intel Journal is much better and publicly available.Save your money.
4,Funny and Addictive...,"A facinating world of people who's lives are consumed with Michael Jordan and memorabilia. This is not your typical documentary, but a well made and VERY FUNNY film. The super fans who hold Jordan as God-like are unquestionably fanatics, but they are sincere and bighearted in their quest to meet Jordan and track down every possible collectible. As interesting as the subject matter is, it's really the well done commentary and production of this film that keeps me putting it in my VCR over and over again. This is one of the few films that I've been able to get my friends and family addicted to."
4,Scary Comedy,"This vouyeristic film, while obstensibily about Micharl Jordan, is really an inside glance at some of the people that we share the planet with. Their surreal obsession and freakish worship will make you laugh out loud... until you realize that these people are real. That is when it gets scary.After he is done laughing (and quivering), the thoughtful viewer will transend the obvious, and will begin to examine the things about which he, and mainstream society, obsesses. He must eventually ask himself the question: How do these things measure up to the accomplishments of one Michael Jeffrey Jordan?At the very least, seeing some of these pathetic losers with no semblence of a meaningful existance will make you feel better about yourself. And that, my friends, is worth the [money] alone."
5,The Whole Nine Yards!,"This is just great! After I studied this book, I have been enjoying watching sitcoms and movies. The expressions that I studied in this book are frequently used by Americans! The expressions in this book are alive! I'm waiting for ""Join the Club 3""!"
1,Looks nice .. but..,"I bought this watch as a fathers day gift for my husband. It looked nice and he loved it, but sure enough about 2-3 weeks in, the watch just stopped working for no reason at all. It was quite a disapointment because it seemed like a nice watch when I bought it but aperently it is defective , since I am not the first costumer to have had this problem wiht the watch in a matter of only a couple of weeks."
3,looks great but...,love the look of this watch... but the shiny chrome finish is very easily scratched! after only a month of use the case is all scratched up already from just being in my pocket... i didn't even have any other items in my pocket that it may scratch against!
5,If you want to learn Mandarin GET this book!,This is an OUTSTANDING book for those who are both begiiners and those who are experienced. The logical flow and relevancy is awesome! HIGHLY recommended!
5,Fantastic aid in understanding Chinese!,"This book is a must buy for any student of the language. It was so helpful in explaining the structure of the language. It has sections on numbers, how the chinese write signs that mean 20% off sale, how to tell time. So many things--After studying from another textbook this book has been invaluable in helping me tie it all together. Another great thing is the book not only has pinyin and english but also traditional and simplified characters. I am very pleased with this purchase."
1,Useless for iPad or Kindle!,"Do not buy the e-book version of this! It has no usable table of contents or index! A grammar e- book with no table of contents to locate and go straight to the section you need? Ridiculous. This is not a novel where one wants to read it cover to cover! The publishers should be ashamed of themselves. Other than the uselessness of the ebook format, the text looks like it would be very helpful in traditional hard copy format- assuming that has a table of contents!"
2,No table of contents !!,"The old version of the book, which I lost, was identical and had a table of contents.I can't find my way through the book without it, and it makes the experience very painful.This is pretty basic !!"
3,Not recommendable,"My native Chinese teacher said,""There so are many errors in this book that I can't recommend you use it"". I'm not sure to what extent this book is usable."
1,What are these other reviewers talking about?,"Many people buy Schaum's outlines because of the price. I keep get suckered into buying another. But as all the other Schaum's outlines, this one isn't even the worth the small price. Poorly organized. Filled with sentences like: ""...the marker of extent modification of adjectival stative verbs..."" with chapters like ""The Resultative Structure and Potential Suffixes"", etc.Get Yong Ho's book, Beginner's Chinese, and the college text, Integrated Chinese, for much better intro to grammar.P.S. The Schaum's Outline on Chinese Vocabulary is even worse!"
3,fast shipment wished,"Although I didn't have time to read through the entire book, I am sure this will be very helpful as a reference book.I am not happy that I had to wait over 1.5 months to receive the book, but I can tell that Amazon made their efforts to ship this item seperatly with another book that I ordered in March, which was not in stock for long time."
1,I had been warned...,"Another review mentioned that there was no table of contents in the Kindle edition. First, I hoped it would have been added by now, second, I thought that maybe it wouldn't be such a hindrance, third, I really wanted to have it on my iPad to easily carry it around. I guess I should have let the other review sink in: this book is useless on the Kindle just because the editor did not put the 2/3 pages of the table of contents. Shame on them, stupid me."
5,Excellent book!,"The Strange Disappearance of Arthur Cluck has been the favorite story of my daughters since they were wee ones. They are now both grown and I received a request to get a copy of Arthur Cluck for my 4-month-old grandson. This is one of the most heartwarming stories I have ever read.There was a straight-pin sized ding on the edge of the cover, but all else was fine."
5,"THE BEST BOOK ON THE OLYMPIC COAST, EVER!","This is the epitome of good writing. It is an excellent resource for all those who love the Olympic Coast. If you are heading to the Olympics, this book is essential. Filled with fascinating facts, history, details, and so forth, it is the Olympic Coast Bible. Buy this book for all your friends, you won't be disappointed."
3,Not a bad book (considering a lack of competition <g>),"A fairly extensive overview of the smart card technology, covering issues ranging from its history to the hardware, communication protocols, programming, and business uses. Another plus is that this book is the only one that can be found in stores. The book contains a tear-off post card with an offer of free Smart Card emulation software for PC/Windows3.1/95 (Not NT). On the negative side: it is a translation from German and a rather poor one. If you can read German, go for the original <g>. Also, it is heavily ""European"", there isn't much about what happens in the US. The price is a bit on the high side, too (a typical store price, including taxes, is about $100, but that's nothing new for Wiley.) The tear-off card, for some reason must be mailed to England (like there isn't a Wiley office somewhere in the US.) Besides, I thought for $100 a disk with the smart card emulator program could have been included."
1,Way too small for the price!,"the picture is beautiful, but a lot smaller than I thought it would be. And quite frankly not worth the price."
3,Could be better,"I was disappointed the apron was so thin but I understand it's an inexpensive set. I do not care for the cookbook at all. They list the basic ingredients for each recipe, but not quantities, so it can be hard to figure out what you'll need to buy. And each recipe has a suggestion for ""jazzing it up"" (in actuality, making it look like the picture) that requires additional ingredients that are listed separately.For example, if you follow the recipe for ""There's a Mouse in the House"" you will make cookie balls. The title of the recipe and the picture imply you'll end up with mice, but this is only achieved by following the optional instructions (""jazzing it up"") and adding red licorice, red candy, and almonds. If you bought them.My 3-year-old and I are having fun, but I wouldn't recommend this set to anyone else."
2,Bad shipping,This product arrived with a mailing label directly on the box. It was not in an amazon box. The picture of the toy was on it. My daughter saw it immediately. This was suppose to be a christmas present. I tried to call the shipper but the phone number on the label was incorrect. I reached someone in Canada. Needless to say I was quite disappointed in this package.
3,OK for a beginner,"This book is pretty basic, but gives you the information you need to get started. If you need anything more than the basics, then best to download and print the voluminous manuals available at the Nero website."
1,Not very useful,"The one part of this book I found helpful was the editing of audio files. This subject is not treated with much detail on the Nero website, but this book helps make some, not all, of the terminology understandable.But for all other subjects, the information was not very useful. It was far too elementary and didn't delve into the difficult parts of the program.I can't recommend this book."
1,States the obvious on usage of an inferior product,"If you have no clue on how to use Nero, and somehow managed to get it cleanly installed (in itself not a fun process) then this book will re-state the obvious. All in all, given the horror of trying to install Nero 7, if you might have benefited from this book, you'll never get far enough on the software install to make the book worth buying."
5,The Book of Nero 7: CD and DVD Burning Made Easy,Can't operate NERO 7 successfully without this book! Great reference as well as tutor! Good job of writing!
5,This is a book you will need for Nero 7,"Because Nero 7 is a large and powerful CD/DVD burner, this is a book which will make it easier to use. Written in the same simple style as his book on Nero 6, the author covers all of the 18 programs in the Nero package showing each in step by step instructions."
2,I prefer the hardrocking M. J. !,"If you like squeaking boys, accompanied by a mostly boring orchestra, then buy this CD. Otherwise, you may hardly wish to listen to more than three or four songs (the well known Ben and a few others). Don't get me wrong, Michael Jackson is a great artist, but not as a boy. Buy HIStory or Thriller instead!"
5,You know what you're getting from Michael!,"Michael's voice as a child has never been out done till this day! Starting out as a soul singer he had the range and emotion to make any song pop with angst and beauty at the same time! Just listen to the closing lines of ABC! But the rare tracks are amazing too - the haunting and most poigant is ""When I Come Of Age"" Michael sings of his hopes and dreams of his adult years and rather he will be a ""mighty man"" or an ""astronaut"" We all know the drama which is Michael and this song is just amazing and is fitting for a man who dreamed of conquering childhood fancy only to live life as achild themself! Michael career has been groundbreaking but this collection only hints at his true genius as a soul singer in the likes of Marvin Gaye and Smokey Robinson it is expressed in more depth in the Jackson 5 SoulSation box set! This is a great starter kit for the experience enjoy!"
4,Heaven Sent,"I have been a fan of Michael's ever since he began. These songs bring back such good memories. However, I think the J5 songs could have been left out, and replaced with other Michael songs. Either from albums or previously unreleased stuff. Small complaint though. ""Love is Here and Now You're Gone"" has always been one of my fave songs, I think Mike's version outdoes the Supremes. ""We've Got A Good Thing Going"" also is a highlight. It suprises me that I still love and want to listen to these songs. The songs taken from the ""Forever Michael"" album also are great. I would love to see that album on cd with unreleased cuts. I know there has to be some of those lying aroung Motown vaults. Funny how, if I never hear ""Billie Jean"" again, it's ok with me. But these songs, are the songs of my childhood and preteen years and sound as fresh today as 30 years ago."
5,I love Him always will Period.,No one on Earth or any other planet can make me change the way i feel about this amazing super star Michael Jackson.I will continue to buy all his cds until the world ends.Iam absoluety proud to have this cd as part of my prestigious collection.Extremely highly recommended to all the wonderful fans who share my admiration of this living Legend.
2,lots of murder not much plot,"thank god this wasnt a 3 hour plus bolly...for theres alot of shooting with not much plot change...a gangster flick, but devgan never gets to show his diversity as an actor with a character thats never""out of character"""
4,Good compilation shows off depth of one-hit folkie wonders,"Though Erik Darling had previously replaced Pete Seeger in The Weavers, it was this group that brought him to the top of the charts. Their retooled version of the late-20s ragtime tune ""Walk Right In,"" topped the charts in 1963. And while it was the Rooftop Singers only chart-topping appearance, it wasn't their only release. Over the course of 3 LPs they mixed jazz and blues into their folk, occupying a somewhat more sophisticated corner of the early-60s folk revival. At 36 minutes, this collection is a bit skimpy, but then, that's the world of mechanical royalties!"
4,Nice mellow mix,If you like Marvin Gaye's songs - and almost everyone will have heard at least some of these songs at some point - then you will be interested in checking out these new takes/tributes by each of these independently sucessful artists.
4,Great Interpretations of Classics,"I really do love the music of Marvin Gaye and his work. To have it reinterpreted by so many different people presents a real challenge. Yet it works. Not incredibly well. But good enough to buy and listen to the variety of interpretations. They do put melodic, rapping and lyrical spins onto the work which in some ways does succeed in making it more their own stand alone interpretations rather than simply reduxes.A great buy......perhaps go for the used price. There are some products that are materially/work product overpriced but are still worth a hearty, avid listening."
5,the best game,"this is the best game for dreamcast. Its fun, cool, and cazy funI can play it for hours and hours. I like the cars the levelsthis is a have to get game. And every one should have one."
1,I thought it was really boring,"Compared to games like Gran Turismo, this game is really poor. It kept my attention for a day and now it is going to sit on the shelf, unless my girlfriend wants to play it. She enjoys the game much more then I do. If you are looking for an even decent racing game, this is not it."
5,Addictive fun!!!,"This is one game that you need to buy. The graphics are sweet, and so is the sound and gameplay.The atmosphere fits the game like a glove.Excellent game!!!"
5,"""Pure"" bluegrass this isn't...but...","...this is a delightful selection of some of eclectic country/rock/newgrass sounds, played with true virtuosity by exceedingly fine musicians.Not their top album if you are new to the Dillards, (Get everything they recorded for Elektra first) but for the Dillards aficionado, a very enjoyable listen.If you like ""pure"" bluegrass, go buy a Bill Monroe album, and quit dissing my boys...(Bluegrass purists have been dumping on the Dillards since I was 5 years old, (even saying that Doug couldn't pick a banjo that fast...the recording had to be sped up), but for my dollar, ""Pickin' And Fiddlin'"" is one of the best pure bluegrass albums ever.)These guys aren't for everyone...just people with good taste."
3,"If you like pure bluegrass, this one is not for you!","I was very disappointed with this album...If you are looking for the more traditional bluegrass sounds with mandolin fiddle, banjo, this album sounded like an old bird that trys to make a litte comeback before it retires for good. It sounds like the Simon & Garfunkel of bluegrass..I would recommend that you attempt to try the Back Porchalbum for a more traditional sound, and leave this one for the person that has the sound of contemporary country music in mind."
2,It's Nothing More Than a Dictionary,"If you're looking for a usage guide like The New Fowler's Modern English Usage or Webster's Dictionay of English Usage, this dictionary is NOT what you want. The Wordsworth Dictionary of English Usage is an ordinary dictionary for learners of English. For example, while many usage dictionaries make it a point to explain how to use ""as,"" ""since,"" and ""because"" properly, often by putting them under one entry or making cross references, the Wordsworth Dictionary of English Usage lists the three words as three different entries and makes no effort to differentiate their usage. The Wordsworth Dictionary of English Usage is like the Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary, except it contains much less information than its Oxford counterpart does. Don't be fooled by the word ""Usage"" in its title. I rated it with only two stars because it is not a book on English usage, nor is it a dictionary specialzed in English usage. I almost wished I hadn't bought it from Amazon."
4,A good traveling size,I won this product and enjoyed the using the product.. it would something I would give a gift.
5,Superb Sampling of DC Comics Work by Alex Ross,"For those of you who can't get enough of Alex Ross, this postcard set won't disappoint you. Featuring a collection of Ross' finest pieces (mostly), avid fans and those new to the medium get a fine sampling of what this artist is producing. A fantastic gift for those fans of Ross' art who haven't seen this postcard set, it's likely one that fans will keep bound and put on their bookshelves."
4,The Best Strategy Game On The Market!,"I was looking for a game that would be better than Tetris, and boy did I find it. This is the most excellent game I have gotten my hands across. And you can get it here on Amazon.com for a good price. It's a very addictive game that I can't put down. And everyone at my job is addicted to it. Not, only you play against the computer which has an intelligent AI, you can also play a good challenging game against your friends with one machine(gameboy). If you miss out on this game you're missing out on a good strategy game. Untill, this day I am so glad that I bought it. Hexcite comes with a tutorial, to show you how to play it. People I garauntee you this is an awesome game. So check it out. You won't be sorry. This is more for an adult to play but young kids can also learn to enjoy this game. It's more like a game of perfection with a twist to it."
4,challenging,This is a fun but mind stimulating game that makes you think about how you can outwit your opponent even if its the computer!! My children and I like to take it with us everywhere.
4,Strategic Puzzlers Dream,Don't buy this game if you don't have time to be addicted. The more you play it the better you get so the more you play it and the better you get... The better you get at the strategy the more fun you have. I am always on the lookout for a great puzzle game and this one is it. I have to end this now Hexcite is calling me.
4,A throwback--a clever but simple strategy game,"If you can pick this up cheap, and you have either a Game Boy Advance or Gameboy Color, get it. Its a fairly clever puzzle game similar to those tile puzzles many of us had as kids where you had to drop geometric shapes into a frame. Certain shapes block other shapes from being dropped, and points are awarded for filling spaces and deducted for left over tiles. The computer opponent is hard (perhaps too hard... which is why I only gave 4 stars) and occasionally takes too long to move. But the game is fun, and yet elegantly simple, at the same time."
3,Price high,I think I over paid but was the only site I trust the piece it's solid and good looking I can't wait to install it
2,Lacking Inspiration,"This video doesn't understand children. The jokes are not appropriate for children, the pace is too slow, the acting is very bad, the costumes that the characters wear are not distinctive. It doesn't rank up with the better children's videos. Zoobilee Zoo has its moments. Karen Hartman, as the Talkatoo Cockatoo, has an excellent singing voice, and a wonderful personality. My 2-year really liked the ""parrot."" Unfortunately, the rest of the cast isn't able to connect. Overall this video just doesn't stack up to the Random House Richard Scarry videos, Maisy videos, and, of course the Barney videos, when it comes to top-notch children's entertainment."
3,Great thermos but ordered 2 and one doesn't keep in heat...,"My dad loves this thermos...I ordered 2 and after a bit of use we realized that one wasn't holding heat in. If you purchase, test the product immediately to make sure it works b/c the vendors return policy is one month and you can't get ahold of a manufacturer b/c they aren't around!"
3,silk undershirt,"This medium-size silk undershirt was quite finely made, but the size was really a small. It fitted my wife quite nicely."
3,Not exactly as pictured,"Thin. Very thin material. The pictured models are not wearing the product, you would see certain things if they were.It's not bad as underlayer, but it would never work as a layer all by itself.It helps buffer standard cold of a ski trip, but I would reccommend you look elsewhere if you're planning on using this for an area that snows a majority of the winter.Also the product comes packaged with a bunch of Adds. Annoying, but not so much to affect the rating really."
5,Excellent general-purpose compact with a twist...,"This binocular does indeed focus down to about a foot-and-a-half, far closer than any other binocular I know of. This makes it essential equipment for: art museums, biological fieldwork, any situation where you want to get closer to things you cannot simply GET closer to.Excellent clarity, as to be expected from a top-line Japanese optical company (as clear as Nikon, for example). Bright enough for the purpose, has diopter (on right, I think), and adjustable for both those who wear eyeglasses and those who do not. They fit my weird, astigmatic, spectacled peepers quite well.And...they are very reasonably priced. A no-brainer. See Rembrandt's brushstrokes up close! Buy them now. It is the right thing to do. :-)"
5,Pentax Porro Prism Binoculars,"Pentax has always made a superior product and the really did with this item. I bought these as a gift and am very happy with them. They are a little higher in price but that is the quality item. Why you might ask? They came in a black leather case and a necck strap. They are APPRX. 5 inches high by 5 inches wide and 2 inches deep and are adjustable to your face (eye) speration. Lifetime limited warrenty. Instructions make it very clear to only use lens cleaner no ""Windex"". These are true binoculars, you do not just adjust one but both for a great three D effect. We used them to look at the mountain that is apprx. 1000 feet from our home and it brought it so close and clear.I can highly recommend Pentax."
5,Powerful and literary short-story collection!,"This beautiful short story collection blew me away! The writers' takes on Generation X have an extraordinary balance of wit, insight and notable literature. Tamara Jeffrie's ""Black Tea,"" David Foster Wallace's ""Girl with Curious Hair,"" and Amanda Filipacchi's ""Nude Men"" (a vignette taken from the novel with the same name -- Nude Men is one of my all-time favorite novels) have elements of magical realism in them. Although this book appears to be targeted toward Gen X readers, this is a timeless and ageless anthology that is to be savored like fine wine. I couldn't recommend this book enough..."
3,Too much bluegrass for me,Tyson is one of my favorite artists...but this CD is a little too twangy or bluegrass sounding for me.....BUTwith the EXCEPTION of 'Springtime in Alberta'....which is genius! Gotta love that song.
5,Great RPG,"Before Evolution, I had never played an RPG (I played Zelda, but that's not a true RPG). I wasn't sure whether or not to get this game, but it was recommended to me. I'm glad I bought it. It's a very fun game that's so addictive it's hard to turn off. Because of this, I'll be buying more RPGs. Great game for RPG beginners."
4,First R.P.G for the DREAMCAST needs improvment,R.P.G's are my favorite type of games and this is one that gives and takes away some of the pizzaz of role playing games. The battle system is a simple and easy way to do combat with your foes. Yet we have this problem with random dugeons. That can frustrate and sometimes even drive away an avid gamer. There is already a sequal out in Japan without the random dungeons. Though it won't be out till either summer or winter of this year. It is a great game and if you like R.P.G's order right away!
5,This game is a great epic adventure.,"If you liked ""Chrono Trigger"" and ""Final Fantasy VII"" you're going to love this! This game is action packed, with the stlye of ""Chrono Trigger"" and the gameplay of ""Final Fantasy VII,"" you'll play it over and over agian. It also has the 3D arts of ""Dragon Ball Z's"" Akira Toriyama. Definatly a must get!-Vegeta"
4,A Very Good RPG,"Evolution is very reminiscent of Phantasy Star II for the Sega Genesis in gameplay and style. You control up to three characters (very cutesy drawn)at a time to go through the standard dungeon fare to build charaters and find neat stuff to pick up along the way. The storyline is OK, but you end up not really caring about it.Very nice graphics and interesting special effects keeps you visually impressed, but the depth is short. Hardcore gamers will beat this game in a weekend, but for someone like me who only plays once a weekend, it'll take a month to complete. Not bad given it's low price.This is a good game for those who want to see what RPG's are all about. For a game with more depth, get any of the Final Fantasy games.Overall, I did enjoy this game and I'm glad I bought it.PS - UBIsoft, next time allow users to skip the videos and predefined text!"
2,Evolution was just a Dreamcast kick start tool that failed!,"Ultimately the gameplay is unsatisfying. Even though the levels are generated randomly, they are all the same. All you do is walk around a simple maze that only changes color based on level. There really are no new enemies, they just get a little tougher. The Dreamcasts disc capacity wasnt taken advantage of, and to be completely honest neither was the graphics processor. If it werent enough that the graphics were simple for this type of game, the gameplay was extremely repetitive, and there was little to no story to speak of the game ends before it really starts. It takes next to no time to beat it. I bought it locally and the store had a seve day return policy, I made it in 2 days. I hope Sega has better than this. OH MY GOD, I'M HAVING A FLASHBACK OF THE SATURN.....good buy money, another disappointment from Sega"
1,PLOT? WHAT PLOT? where!?!?!,"This game is bad. It gives a wonderful system a bad name. The graphics are pretty dran good, but anything that is 128-bit will look pretty good. there is NO plot. I am a huge fan of RGS's but I have one beef with most of them. They seem a little to childish for me. Well this game seems it is a childs game. SKIP on this one. you can beat it in 5 hours but it isn't even worth renting."
2,DIsappointing title,"I bought this game used from a friend, and had high hopes even with his disappointed attitude towards it. After playing for what seemed like hours going through far too similar levels, I realized that all the levels were just randomly generated. While this lets the game fit on one cd, it makes the story line a very small part of the actual time spent playing. The only plus side to the game is the actual mechanics of battle. Unlike the final fantasy style (I'm not putting down FF, I'm actually a big fan) the fighting in this game has a lot more strategy involved. The attacks are rather humorous and the graphics are great. But without a storyline readily available to look at and interact with, the game comes up lacking."
3,nice but not enough,"Since i bought the dreamcast I wanted an RPG and here is Evolution. This game was kind of disapointing since theres only one town and only six random dungeons, since it lacks in replay and length I dont recomend this game if youre a veteran in RPG's but its nice for begginers, bores you in about 4-7 hours of game play and the plot isnt good, nice gameplay and beatiful graphics nice try for a first RPG lets see how the sequel does."
4,A good cap for a decent price,"I'm just not a fan of wearing caps with logos on them, so it's difficult for me to find unbranded, good quality caps. I was thrilled to find these on Amazon. The cap is decently priced, well constructed, looks good and fits well. Can't ask for more than that.I've bought a couple other hats from this vendor and was satisfied with those purchases as well."
1,Horrible Joy Stick,Bought one of these years ago was the worst stick i ever saw. Buttons stuck and could never get it configured to work with IL2.
4,Great!,The product is awesome and has all the buttons you need. The shock system is very good but the rudder is not that great.
4,Superb Instrumentation; Scripted Arrangments,"In many respects, this is a wonderful CD. The melodies are catchy, and the players--particularly Brown--are out of this world. There is, however, a scripted quality to the music--as if we're being treated to orchestral arrangments where each player is dutifully following the sheet music, as opposed to the more improvisational ethos I enjoy in other bluegrass. (Perhaps it's just a personal preference.) That said, I've played this album consistently when I've had dinner guests, and it never fails to draw raves from the visitors. It's a different sort of instrumental CD, and they always love it. I recommend it."
5,loved maggie in this one,I've always loved dark shadows... I remember running home from school to watch it and seeing the first vampire that I fell in love with.....
3,Check this out!,"This was Trinket's first CD. I got it a couple years ago and I still listen to it. It's way different from their lates cd, ""Trinket"". It's not as good either, but if you like the band you'll love this cd. I know I do. So check it out!"
1,pedantic (look it up youll have to look up everything else),though this book is supposed to have been revised for the general public im sure even professionals will find the overuse of medical terminology tedious.
3,"Good research, but very long & lots of detail","In terms of research & detail, this book is unparalleled for the period it covers (the founding of the Foreign Legion until the 1980s. The problem is that is gives too much detail. There are some 500+ pages of very fine print, and it takes a long, long time to read. The only reason I finished the book was I had already read 100 pages by the time I realized how slow it was going to be. At that point, I felt I'd invested too much time not to finish.What might be breathaking narratives are convoluted with arcane details. For historical purposes, this might be good... but for a less voluminous, easier-reading history of the French Foreign Legion, which also covers more current information, I suggest John Parker's ""Inside the Foreign Legion."""
5,"Great Price, Great Performance","This product fit and worked great on my 2002 Chevrolet Silverado 4X4. I could have not gotten this module at a better price.Thank you, I look forward to purchasing from your store in the future."
5,Rayman 2 The Great Escape,"The best game I play in a long time. The level's are cool and very pretty. The background color is great and smooth.Rayman is trying to save himself and he's friend's form being takeing over. If he does't the world will be lost forever.In the game to save the world you must fine four mask in the hidden world's and in the game rayman's friend's will help you to get your power's back.You are in rayman's world now. Help him save the world before it is to late. In the game you will fine lums in cages in the world's help the lums escape. There are many lums. There are blue lums, lums that give you air. And there are red lums that give you heath and life. In the game you get to go in the pretty places and the darkness places in the game.Save the world form evil and darkness before the goodness is gone forever.Have fun in the game I did and I love it, you will love it too.I hope."
5,It's like a Saturday morning cartoon brought to life!,"Rayman 2 is a perfect game for all ages, a deep game with plenty of terrific gameplay, secrets, and beautiful worlds to explore. Sure, you might question why the main hero doesn't exactly have limbs, but what you have here is a game that's even enough to make Mario blush. One of Nintendo 64's best games to date."
5,to all the moms out there,"This game is the best game ever (except, of course The Legend of Zelda: Ocorina of time). The main charater, Rayman is the king. with only a few body parts, he has to stay ship shape to survive. So, to all the mom's, buy this game for you're son(s) or daughter(s), or even for yourself . Thank you for you're time"
3,"Fun, but way to easy","This is a fun game, but it was just to easy! I rented it from blckbuster and beat it on the second day! Do not buy it, rent it if you want to check it out. You may find it hard, but i hardly play video games and i beat it. The bosses seem like they are not even trying! I wanted to like this game, but easy games are not worth buying. Fun, but just to easy."
4,Looks beautiful but it's not Zelda or Mario 64,"To be honest it's not even Banjo Kazooie. I'm afraid that I've been spoiled by the wonderful Nintendo games I've played already and kept expecting there to be something more - in Zelda or Mario most of the environment can be related directly to the game, whereas in Rayman 2 most of appears to be simply - scenery. However I am only about a third of the way through the game and perhaps I'm missing something. It also is a bit linear for my taste and some of the levels are too easy.This would be a nice present for kids and I think they'd really enjoy it. If it had been the first Nintendo game I'd ever played, however, I'd probably think it was absolutely brilliant!"
1,And I Thought The Dreamcast Vertion Was Bad!,"Although a lot of people liked this game I hated it. For one thing this game was WAAAAYYYYYY too easy (I beat this game in three days playing only 1 hour a day! The first game had me playing for mounths! )! You're supposed to find this fairy to give you all your powers back, and yet you start the game with all your powers! Plus I don't care how good the graphics are, Rayman does NOT look good in 3D and does not belong in 3D! So get the first game, I don't recomend this game to ANYONE! And you know what's worse? This Nintendo 64 vertion looks WORSE and plays WORSE than the Dreamcast vertion! Now that's sad (Even though I never liked N64)."
3,Too short...,"Just to let you know, This game is way too short to be a pretty good game. It took me only five hours to beat. If you want a very long game that is VERY hard to beat, then get Jet force Gemini. That game is so hard and long that I'm still trying to beat that game. or get the easier but not as easy as Rayman 2 older Id Software's first person shooters. DOOM for an example or Wolfenstien 3-D."
3,BUY PLAYSTATION 2 VERSION FOR RAYMAN 2,"i was attracted to the game by accident. i was enjoying my stay in a hotel room at the Marriott and was playing their Playstation video games like Rayman 2 and LOVED the story, the sound, etc. A beautiful female narrator (LY) telling the story about their doomed world, the physical thunder sounds, the vibrant colors, beautiful worlds, NOBODY speaking gibberish. I was hooked!then, i buy the game on my Nintendo 64 platform (i'm a nintendo 64 devotee), and it's like buying something half-baked!! everybody speaking gibberish, no verbal sounds by any narrator, am not able to save on my expansion pack.if i had known, i'd have just bought a playstation and bought the game on THAT platform. oh well!! :-(it's still a great game, but a better platform is Playstation, its original platform"
1,My frogs won't touch!!,I bought these in hopes that my African Dwarf Frogs would eat them so I wouldn't have to mess with worms. They wouldn't even think about trying to eat them. But they wouldn't eat the freeze-dried worms either. Maybe they are just picky eaters. I have had to go with the frozen worms!
2,Androgynous Prince of Denmark!,"This video seems to have been made to cash on Mr. Malakhov's rising reputation as an international star.The plot follows Shakespeare's play, but many secondary characters and incidents have been ommitted. The sets and costumes are poor. Mr. Malakhov's tight metallic leoptard outrageously emphasizes his private parts! A rather poor actor, his Hamlet has neither anguish nor depth. The other dancers - all unknown to me - are pedestrian and the choreography (?) is second-rate.The score uses Shostakovitch's music for the film ""Hamlet"", plus selections from some of his string quartets.Lasting less than an hour, I would recommend it only for die-hard fans of Mr. Malakov."
4,It's definitely worth the fifteen bucks,"Until whoever the record compay is that had PRS chooses to release their two albums on CD, scoop this up - and bootleg yourself a copy, you'll wear it out almost as soon as you receive it. The sound? like an adult.. Gay Rats...whoops, Stray Cats. And PRS's version of the one number the Hollys did that wasn't an embarrassment, ""Long Cool Woman"" is absolutely stripped down and rebuilt from the bottom up,and improved 1000%. But, hey, the Cats' rhythm section, and Earl Slick? What more do you want? Yes, you CAN tell a good album by the cover!"
4,AIDS IN A NUTSHELL,"Grmek, a Serbian physician and naturalized French citizen, gives us a broad overview of Aids and how it has shaped the world since its appearance in 1981. The book first examines the early years of the epidemic and then looks at issues created by the new virus. Most of what one has heard about the disease, from stories of Soviet propaganda to popular misconceptions, is touched upon in the book at one place or another. Considerable length is devoted to the question of when and where Aids began, a matter of interest to almost everyone who might want to read this work.I have two problems with this book. First of all, while comprehensive, it skips too quickly from topic to topic and gives too little detail about some important matters. Secondly, it is quite out of date by now. Scientific progress, not to mention the Aids virus itself, is changing rapidly and so Grmek might be advised to put out an updated edition"
1,MIDWAY should be ashamed! The creators of these games have been insulted!,"The front of the box shows what the game looked like in Arcades.The back of the box, shows the sad let down that is the GBA version!Now if that isn't deceptive advertising, I don't know what is!!"
3,review of game,This game is what you would remember from the original nintendo. It is still fun and challenging. If you want a game to tease your mind; with old graphics it will do it.
1,Not what I thought it was,"This isnt' a review talking about the quality of the games or how good the translation is. This is simply a public service to anyone like me who loves Gauntlet on the NES. It's the only version I ever played so when I thought I could have it on my GBA, of course I was excited. However, shortly after purchase I realized it is not the same game as the NES version. So that's really all I have to say about it. It may be a great game for all I know but I took it back because it's not what I wanted. So if you're like me, and want to take the NES version of Gauntlet with you...sorry, no dice. You'll have to do what I did and drag the NES back out and find yourself a copy of the original cartridge. (Worth it, by the way.)"
4,Comfortable To Use,"I would have given these crutches a 5, but I find that the handles are designed, misaligned. My experience is that you must grip the handles closer to their ends, or you put strain on your wrists."
5,Very good cyberpunk novel,"I like this genre when it is done well and Stross does it well. I enjoyed and cared about the characters. In some ways, it reminded me of Century Rain by Alistair Reynolds.A couple of strangers meet after coming out of a rejuvenation program with parts of their memory excised (by their own choice) and enter into a virtual world for a few years as part of a study. They quickly discover the study is being run by someone with ulterior motives and they also discover that they may have ulterior motives that they did not know about.Clever and interesting, I'd recommend this one."
4,video game novel,"At one point in Glasshouse, the main character considers whether he used to be a gamer who became overly involved in virtual environments and lost touch with reality. To me, this whole book reads like a good concept for a MMORPG or some other type of game. The characters are ""living"" and ""dying"" as players in a virtual world. This is kind of an obvious theme that Stross is going for-- virtual worlds can give rise to various feelings, ways of being, whatever. I appreciate that Stross used the ideas to create an engaging story rather than just throwing all the ideas out there... see Acclerando."
2,Pointless Violence,"The books starts off ultra-violent, and quickly lost my interest.I read and enjoyed Chales Stross's ACCELERANDO, and I routinely read a lot of Military SciFi which contains violence related to war scenarios and battle situations... but the violence in this book was pointless. Within the first dozen pages, the ""hero"", who has had most of his memories removed, enters a bar and almost immediately gets involved in a ""fight to the death duel"" with some unnamed woman.I know I'll get a lot of negative feedback for this review; but the fact is, this book is not for everyone. I haven't written off Charles Stross just yet - but I have written off pointless violence."
2,Decelerando,"I didn't enjoy this book at all. It's a boring little whodunit, adorned with sci-fi artifacts.The story in this book takes place in the world that exists at the end of ""Accelerando"". While ""Accelerando"" is fast-paced and fun, with a logical progression, this book is slooooooooooooooooooooow and full of contrived plot twists.It's going to get the normal boring book treatment: it'll become a travelling book at my local coffee house. Good luck to it."
1,Absurdity Overwhelmed Me,"Spoilers.I couldn't get past the first few pages because I could not suspend disbelief.We are told that editing of a person's memory causes rage. (I don't buy it.) We are told that the cure for the rage is acting out violence. (Ted Bundy would approve, but I object.) The rage is acted out by engaging in sword fights. (Excuse me? Did I buy a book about history?) The combatants get to the arena via handy wormholes. (I may accept the impossible Star Trek transporters, but wormholes next to the counter in every bar is just too much to ask.)I wasted my money."
3,Don't throw (too many) stones!,"I don't read a lot of science fiction but my Book Club picked this one so I gave it a try. I liked it although found the plot a little hard to follow with characters changing into other bodies and all the time shifting but in the end it was a love story. The author has an excellent vocabulary and I found myself constantly looking up words so, I enjoyed learning some new things."
2,My least-favorite Stross,Starts out with a lot of promise and a far-future setting that could go anywhere. Unfortunately that anywhere narrows down to turning the lead character into a housewife in an oppressive simulacrum of 1950s America. All the elements of turn-the-main-character-into-someone/something else seemed to me to have already been exploited in Jack Chalker's Well of Souls novels -- not that I'm recommending those at all.
2,It is not scifi,"To be honest, I couldn't get through the entire book, so here is my impression of the beginning:It's not a science fiction, at least it doesn't feel like one. If you're expecting the high tech feel like from Accelerando (I just read that before buying this), you will be sorry. The ""experiment"" the protagonist goes through (which I think lasts through the bulk of the book) is a replica of the 20th century. So you'll be reading much about how our era sucks and how bass ackwards it is as opposed to reading how incredible the future is.Not what I expected and I just don't want others to buy it for the reason I bought it."
4,another great part of the series,this was a gread book which lent to the dynamic characters of the series. If you enjoy character driven stories in a rich world this is the book and series for you
5,The best Dresden so far!!,"Each Harry Dresden book seems to get better and better. The beginning couple of books from the series were very good, the next couple were even better, and the next really great. When I brought Dead Beat home, I was looking forward to reading it, and was pleasantly surprised to find that the story surpassed even my high expectations. I couldn't put this book down.Harry is becoming a real person, fascinatingly complex and likeable. Our increasing familiarity with his fellow characters and his growing capabilites and problems make us really care for him, make his character seem real.Jim Butcher just keeps getting better and better at this! Outrageous fun, and thrills galore. I can hardly wait to read the next ones! Thanks, Jim Butcher. Please keep them coming!"
4,More Dresden Goodness,"""Dead Beat"" is the 7th in Butcher's ""Dresden Files"" series (which starts withStorm Front (The Dresden Files, Book 1)if you haven't read any of the series). It takes place about a year after the events in the previous book (Blood Rites (The Dresden Files, Book 6)). And, once again, if you liked the previous Dresden novels, you'll like this one. There are a couple of stylistic differences in this book, though. Firstly, there are a couple of very specific plot points that are predicated on events from the previous two books (this goes beyond the normal level of background carryover from previous books). Secondly, and most interestingly, Butcher is bringing up a lot more of the philosophy behind the choices Harry has to get through regarding good/evil and power. It makes for interesting reading. So, I rate this at a Very Good 4 stars out of 5."
3,Good read -- a surprise awaits!,"Thank gawd for a surprise in this book! I like the Harry character. He's getting older and seasoned in his craft. Thus, it is time for an attitude adjustment. The 'sensitive' warrior personality coupled with constant self-doubt is getting old. Jeez, Harry is a White Council Warden now! He is required to act like a seasoned wizard able to provide guidance and mentoring to the newbies. The Blue Beetle should be fondly 'let-go' and be replaced by a Jeep or Harley reflecting elevated status and maturity. Harry should either act decisively with Karrin or 'let-go'. I'm currently reading the next book in the series, 'Found Guilty,' and am finding that I too must 'let-go.' Bye Harry. Love you Karrin!"
2,Entertaining but predictable light fare,"I have read all of the Dresden files books to date, and will probably read the rest, too. I am far too lazy to rate all of them - so I'll settle for just this one. This series is not terribly original, intelligent or believable. It is however, very entertaining. It's the mental equivalent of popcorn - not too filling, heavy, or time consuming. I should also note that I read these books despite the authors annoying ""About"" blurb; come on, this sounds like every insecure, wannabe D&D nerd I've ever met..."
5,Wild Ride,"This is a great story. I especially like the character Butters in this book, as he is really just an average guy, and he finds out some stuff about himself. All the Dresden File books are exciting, and the ending to this one is literally a really wild ride. Anyone who likes action with a sense of humor will really enjoy these stories."
5,An excellent book,Wow this is one of the best of a great series by Jim Butcher. In this book not only does Harry's character grow and becomes more interesting the character Waldo Butters grows tremendously as well. I couldn't put the book down once I started reading.
1,Missing pages,"unfortunately, was missing the first 92 pages!!! Not very happy after reading the previous book and wanted to get into book 2...."
5,Awesome book,I just started reading this series and have to say that they have all been very well written. They are very entertaining and read very easily. I give this 5 stars.
5,Harry In Trouble Again,"The book is a good read. A bit repetitious in certain areas of introducing people, places and things. If a reader hasn't learned of some of these portions of Harry's world by now, they aren't interested in the series."
4,good,"If you think the modern/urban fantasy genre is getting tired, the dresden books keep it alive, or at least undead."
4,Ghost Story Memoir,"This book is a memoir, yet chronicles a haunted house. Its very interesting and the author does a great job describing the ""Gold Coast"" of Long Island. The history of the area, however, does not overwhelm the story, which according to the author is true. Read this book if you are interested in the history of Long Island or ghosts."
2,A Ghost Story...Not A Book On Winfield,"Before you buy this book read this and all the other reviews so that you understand what you're getting. This is essentially a ghost story involving the Woolworths and taking place in Winfield. If you are looking for a history of the Woolworths, or an architecture book devoted to Winfield you will be disappointed. I read this book in one evening and eBay'ed the next day. It was not a keeper. In defense of Ms Randall her more serious works on the houses of the Gold Coast are superb. THAT's where architecture buffs should spend their money."
5,Living Under the Shadow of the Woolworths,"One of the best books I have read in a long time. If you love beautiful old homes and the supernatural, this book is for you! This author knows how to write in such a descriptive way that I felt that I was actually there."
2,Interesting Account of the Gold Coast,"This book is interesting in its account of the Woolworths and their haunted mansion. However, I was not impressed with the historical details in this book. This books seems more like a fictionalized account of a woman's experience in a haunted mansion than a non-fictional account. The fact that I learned very little of the life of the Woolworth and his life left me at a loss at the end of the book."
4,My kids' favorite Jewish music tape -- and mine too!,"Craig and Co.'s CD, ""My Jewish Discovery"" delights us every time we listen to it. I have worn out and scratched my original copy and am ordering another. My second grader likes it and my fifth grader loves it. The music is not traditional songs you know, but new songs, each in a different musical style, from zydeco to rock to rap. My only criticism is a track or two of talking by a famous Yiddish actor. It's okay once, but we don't need to listen to it over and over. The Chanukah rap song, ""Go Judah"" is our absolute favorite."
3,Flowing tears-Razorbliss,This is a gift for my son so I do not have any idea about how this product is. He requested it so I am sure he will like it.
3,a headache in kids game packaging,"when this game starts,its a innocent little charming wonderland of carnival rides,late night beach parties and clowns.then it goes straight to hell.at 1st,you can race cars around the beach,build roller coasters,battle clowns and all,kinds of cool stuff.but after that you go to all these very complicated worlds no kid could ever beat unless his name was jimmy nuetron.if you like building roller coasters though,you can build them as much as you want on level onei do that a lot.since theres no beach tracks on nascar 2000,they only real alternative is racing the beach on this game.[in the old days,the daytona 500 was really raced on the beach]."
5,Really Fun,"When I rented this game I wasn't sure what it would be like, but once I started playing I just couldn't stop! Its not like most of those fighting games where all you do is shoot things, you have to find little admission tickets. I really like the vehicles you ride. Especially the hovercraft that shoots paint!"
5,awsome game,"This is definetly one of the best games I've ever played. It is not one of those games where you just go around shooting pwople and hopung you don't die. If you are looking for a game with plenty of levels and puzzles that require lots of thinking but they make the game twice as fun, buy this game. If I could I would have given this game 8 stars but I can't (duh)."
5,Gamer,Rocket: Robot on wheels is the most original game to come down the pike since Toe Jam and Earl. This game takes platform games to a new level. Most games deal with a plain character battling enimies with a sword or fists. Rocket battles foes with a beam that is equipped on its body. You also get to drive numerouse vehicles through large worlds that are full of puzzles. Rocket isnt really a fighting game nor is it just a puzzle game. It's both! Most of the emphasis goes towards solving puzzles that are extremely fun and original. Any fan of platform games should add this to their collection
5,Fantastic - never get tired of it.,These guys are great. I don't know much about jazz but this is one of my very favorite CD's.
3,"Okay, but Kelby's new book is better","This book is pretty good, but lacking in good examples in my opinion. The techniques are fine but I thought the examples and the instructions given in Scott Kelby's book are better.I had to choose, I think I'd buy Kelby's digital photogrpahy book (plus it's for Photoshop 7 and includes info on the new Camera Raw plugin)"
3,Good - but not for the inexperienced,"When I bought this book it was as an aid to my understanding of the use of Photoshop in conjunction with digital cameras. To a large extent it succeeded and I learnt a great deal from it.Potential purchasers should, however, understand that the book appears to be targeted rather more at the professional photographer than the amateur with moderate cost equipment. The chapter on colour management is, for example, good, but deals mostly with high end devices and does not really help those who print to standard colour inkjet printers.The author also has an annoying habit of assuming that the reader is already familiar with much of Photoshop and, worse, that they have already read the previous version of his book!If you are a beginner to either Photoshop or digital photography this book is not for you, but if you already have some experience then you will probably find it very useful and if you are a professional photographer then it will probably be invaluable."
2,This book... is lame,"1. I'm a photographer and wanted to get a comprehensive but easier to understand book on photoshop. This book is supposed to fit that need perfectly, according to the preface. 2. However, the books fails in several areas. First of all, it's somewhat difficult to understand--it seems that you have to prior knowledge of photoshop. One can easily read several pages or paragraphs without really understand what the author's point is. On the other hand, when it comes to pragmatic things like actually learning how to color correct or do things like that... ie things that a photographer would actually like to learn--> there's really not enough detailed information. 3. Thus, the book is a dude. Save your money and get Gary Bouton's book or Photoshop Artistry. Furthermore, the CD that came with the above book is totally lame..."
2,Comletely worhtless,"Could not find any application for my needs. May be usefull for professional photographers with press print application in mind, but for andvanced and amatuers photographers is useless"
2,Unorganized and complex,"I am beginner with PhotoShop. Not a newbie but still a beginner. This book is clearly aimed at the advanced, professional PS user. Unless you know the PS jargon as well as advanced image processing jargon in general you will be lost on many of the paragraphs. Also I find it hard to use as a reference as the examples are typically not step-by-step and the sections are long and unorganized. For pro's this may be a good book, but beginners should look elsewhere, as for instance the PhotoShop Bible."
4,One of Florida's Finest!,Mike-E has been throwin down for a while now in the digital underground. This album has just brought him up. A set of fully loaded tracks that keep you moving to the beat wanting more and more after every song. Trust me....once you here Mik-e throw down the beat will stay in your head forever.---------nuff said!---------- ~=ThePsychoFunk has spoken=~
4,Good for the price,"The auto-reverse gear mechanism inside was very loud while playing, so I took it apart and removed the gears and it now it works great. This was very easy to do, only 6 screws, and definitely worth the trouble compared to spending $20 for an adapter with the word ""iPod"" on the package. Buying a tape adapter, you know the sound quality isn't going to be great, but it's a lot better than a radio transmitter."
1,Save your money.,"I bought this unit to replace my old one which I use to play my ipod in my car. Right out of the box, sound quality was garbage. Very echo-y and for some reason the sound was not evenly and appropriately distributed between the left and right channels. It also had a delay between he left and right channels. I went out and got the Monster 800 adapter from target for $18 and it sound way better. You get what you pay for."
2,Cheap,Works fine.Sound quality is not very good. might not be the most durable but will be good if you take care of it and if it breaks it doesn't hurt to buy a new one.
2,"Easy to use, terrible sound quality.","I got this a few weeks ago. It's super easy to use, but the sound quality of it is terrible. Even when turning the volume down on the ipod, the quality is muffled and poor. If you have any amount of bass in your speakers, it sounds bad as well. I would not recommend this product."
2,Did not work for me,"As is, this product will not work with a auto-reverse tape decks. I had read the reviews and thought I could get it to work by using the trick of opening the tape up and removing a specific gear. This trick did not work for me though. My car is a 2001 Infiniti G20 with a Bose cd/tape combination (in case anyone out there is looking for a tape adapter and has the same car as me). From what I can tell, tape decks seem to be very fickle and there is no perfect adapter that works for every car. This item might work for some cars, but it did not work with mine. I ended up buying a Sony model, which has been working well so far."
3,"good the first day, degraded to crap over one week","the first day i got this i was shocked at the relatively good quality it put through, then every day i thought it got worse but i just assumed it was the different music i was listening to.. but today it was just unbearable, the bass was completely broken like it was putting out scratchy loud noise in part of the bass so i had to turn it off and listen to the radio. i hate the radio.btw i live in northern nj, maybe it's the cold? but i don't understand why yesterday was fine and today all of a sudden it was unbearable.. it was like 30F today not thaaat bad"
1,Broke my whole car,"When I got this item, I was amazed. It worked pretty well and I could listen to my ipod all the time. Within a month or so of owning it, however, it got stuck in my cassette player and wouldn't come out. When we finally got it out, it had damaged the radio and the radio wouldn't turn off. That meant that when I would leave my car at night, it would be out of battery by the morning and I wouldn't be able to start it to get to work! We had to install a switch in my car that turns off the radio so I can save battery, but I still can't listen to cassettes!"
4,"if it doesn't work at first try flipping it over, then it works great","At first I was really disappointed with this product because every time I stuck it in the cassette player in my car it just spit it right back out. Finally after much frustruation I ignored the ""this side up"" label on the top of the cassette and stuck it in upside down and voila! it worked. the only thing you have to worry about doing it this way is that the cord then comes out the back side of the cassette, fortunately there is a groove in the top of the cassette that the cord fits in so it doesn't get stuck. once it got it working the sound quality is amazing, you have to turn it up a little louder than the radio, but it's not a problem. For the price I paid I'm impressed."
1,0 Star.. It broke after 3rd time of use.. cheap!!,"0 Star.. It broke after 3rd time of use.. cheap!!It felt tempting to buy, but waste."
4,works as expected,"Certainly the cheapest way to hook your iPod up to your car. Sound quality reminds me of quarter inch cassettes. No bias hiss, as with cassette tape, but the overall muffled sound like a cassette. Turn the treble & volume up, and you're good to go."
1,Terrible quality,Immediately it created that crackly noise that you get with old headphones...and the sound quality is terrible. Sounds like it's in a muffled tin can. There are better adapters out there. Keep on looking because this one isn't worth it at all!!
4,Cheap & gets the job done!,"I was looking for a decent cheap car cassette adapter so I could listen to my mp3 player while driving. This one definitely gets the job done. The clicking noise isn't as bad as some of the other adapters I've used. You may be able to get a slightly cheaper/better one on Ebay, but this one works without the hassle of having to bid. Overall I'm really glad I bought it---no more trashy radio stations!"
1,Stay away from this product,"The classic proverb, you get what you pay for works on this product. Worst ever I bought, stay away from this."
2,99 cents of cassette worth,"Only plays sound in the left side of the speakers in my car, makes the device unusable...I guess that's what I get for only paying a buck."
1,Get what you pay for,"It worked great for like a week. Then I started hearing static. Not my speakers, the radio sounds fine. Not my device, I've tried more than one."
2,ineffective,"This product worked, however, i had to turn my ipod up all the way if I wanted to hear any music what so ever, otherwise my radio would just reject the tape and eject it."
1,didnt work,it made a static noise when listening to music. only thing that sounded good was the bass. music qulity was gone. i tried this out in 2 different cars
2,Didn't work,"The shipper got it to me quickly, so no complaint there. I bought this for my son's ""new"" '99 Sonata. It only had a tape player. The player kept spitting it out and I could not get it to work. I took the gears out, thinking maybe it was causing it to ""think"" it was at the end of the tape or something, but still no go. In all fairness, it may be the fault of the player, but it just did not work for me. It was not a very big deal since the cost was so low compared to local retail. It was worth a shot. Two stars instead of one since I was unsure about where the problem lay,"
3,"It an ""OK"" adapter","I read many reviews before buying this one for my car. Since a lot of people seemed to spend a lot of money on all different types of adapters and end up with the same complain: ""Sound quality"", I decided to spend as little as possible and was already prepared for whatever the product would give back. I believe the only way to have a decent sound from your Ipod is having a system installed in your car, any other kind of adapter (the radio or cassette tape ones) all of them suck!!! For all and all I have to say I am OK with it, because I do not have the extra money to install a system in my car, so... I am OK with this adapter for now. It works fine, and I never forget I paid only $.80 for it, so... I'm cool with that. I guess my worst complain is when I try to increase the volume of a song: the louder it goes, the worst quality sound I get! :)"
4,My two cents,"The sound quality is good. Sometimes it does that thing (that every one of these things I've owned has done) where, when you're first starting it, it will pop itself out a few times. Not a big deal. You just push it back in until it stays. It will never do it after it's gotten itself going though. Overall, I'm pleased with it."
3,Flimsy,"This would be a great product were it not for the fact the wire tends to short out thus losing or greatly diminishing one side of the stereo. I've owned two of these, and the first one lasted a long time before this problem became evident. My newer one has begun ""acting up"" after less than three months."
1,"Did not work, not worth my time in exchanging.","I purchased this item because I was in need of a tape adapter for my MP3 player but this sure did not do the job, It may be cheap but not worth buying something that does not work. I would not recommend this item."
1,Don't bother - doesn't work,"I've had this type of adapter for my MP3 for years. I finally wore out the wire and decided to replace it. They were so cheap I ordered two. One wouldn't stay in the cassette player - it just popped right out again. The other worked but the sound quality was really bad compared to my other adapter. I got a replacement for the one that didn't work at all and guess what? It didn't work either, wouldn't stay in the cassette player. They don't refund shipping (there was a shipping charge when I ordered) so you don't even get all your money back for THEIR defective product. My advice - don't bother unless you want to be disappointed."
1,Plays great for 7 seconds,"Pop this into your car's cassette deck, hook it up to your Ipod, press play, and enjoy your music--for about 7 seconds. THen, the cassette will decide to eject itself. Try it again, and again, again, and get the same results. If you like your music in very brief bursts, this is perfect. Otherwise, it's a piece of $#%!. Get what you pay for."
1,You get what you pay for.,"I ordered this for use in our 2000 Subaru, which only has a cassette player. It was cheap, but it also didn't work."
2,it's just a band-aid,It's a bit muffled and lacks volume control. It's fine if you are in between stages of upgrading your car stereo with an auxiliary input. Just know that you have to balance the volume between your mp3 device and your stereo. It doesn't come with any instructions.
5,Excellent product,"There isn't much to say except I got the item when I was supposed to, popped it in and started listening to music. I don't have an iPod hook on my stock radio so this adapter allows me to still listen to my music. The sound quality is just as good as the direct hook up my wife has with her aftermarket head unit. It's way better than the fm transmitter I was using before. I would recommend this to anyone that has an older car with a cassette player that wants to listen to their iPod. And it was so cheap!"
1,DOES NOT WORK,"Unit does not work, It's completely the wrong size and doesn't fit all the way into cassette player in my two vehicles that I tried."
1,Ashah,This doesnt work at all on first insert. Finally after so many attempts it works with very poor sound quality.I end up buying philips from walmart. Complete waste of money. Its truly not worth it.
1,Sub par quality,"I bought this to replace one that died, but the sound is so grainy that it is unusable this product is garbage do not purchase it."
1,doesn't work,"My car's cassette player kept rejecting it. But of the couple of times that it did work, the music wasn't clear and and there was a clicking sound in the background."
1,Only plays in MONO.,"Sound is fairly good if you don't have lots of base or want stereo sound. I had to play with it quite a bit before I would get sound, but once I got it in there just right it was okay. And I tried it with multiple cassette players, in car stereos and in regular cassette players. I finally got something different, and wished I had got the better one sooner! What I ended up getting was the Xm Auto Cassette Adapter. It has stereo sound and you just stick it in and listen to whatever music you have. Whether it has lots of bass or not. This adapter is not worth a penny in my opinion!"
2,does the job but makes a ticking noise that is very annoying,"does the job but makes a ticking noise that is very annoyingyou pay for what you get. it works, but it makes a ticking noise as if there actually tape inside"
2,car cassette adapter,"When I received this item it did not work. I was very disappointed, but considering the sale price, I should have expected it not to be of very high quality. However without any pressure from me the company sent me a replacement. While I am still not pleased with the original product, I am pleased with their response."
1,Not Worth It,"Upon first use this works quite well, however within a half hour the sound devolves to unbearable bass wobbliness. We actually bought two of these because of the cheapness and the positive reviews and both have responded the same way. Avoid this adapter."
1,"Waste of Money, do not buy.","Well I got it in when I was supposed to but it doesn't work. It wont play anything and it keeps saying error in my cars cd/tape player. The cassette doesn't even wind to give me a sense that it is working. Just to be sure I tried it out on an old stereo with a cassette player and nothing, its junk so don't buy it."
1,HORRIBLE,this item was horrible. i plugged it in and it was all fuzzy and the music was so low no matter how loud i turned the volume up. i hope the company backs their product and does a full return. DO NOT BUY
2,not the adaptor for a Ford,"This rather inexpensive adaptor may be okay for most cars, but it does not work in a Ford. Specifically I drive a Crown Vic from the early 90s. The Vic's tape player won't even recognize the adaptor as a tape. It simply goes in and nothing happens. I followed the advice of other reviewers by removing gears, but this didn't change anything."
1,Does not work,"I ordered this item so that I could listen to my MP3 player in the car. I'd tried an FM adapter, but it doesn't work well living in the city. Unfortunately this adapter does not work at all. I tried it several time and all it does is make a buzzing noise. I am getting rid of it."
1,No Patriotism,"I thought a two volume set of American Poetry would contain *many* poems about the American Revolution and Liberty. I found 4, count 'em 4, such poems in this set. If you love America, this set is not for you. I plan to return it."
3,A ska version of Armagideon Time,"If your reading this, you're a Strummer completist and already have Streetcore. The new tune here is a horn driven Armagideon Time. It's worth the money if you want to here a more ska oriented version of this classic."
3,If it wasn't for HER...,"Without the incomparable Ms. Leigh, there would be no real reason to watch this film. It is sluggishly paced when she is not onscreen, and it can be hard to care about the plot. An interesting note, though, she sings! Just a little."

2,I should have known,"There's nothing here you can't find on the internet. To be fair, with the book at least you can look at the book while you're away from your computer. However there's really not much here. Lots better stuff can be found by google search, even allowing for all the BS that's out there."
4,Zombie-x,"To start of this is a great book with deatailed step-by-step plans to show you exactly how to make a 12 gauge shotgun from a pipe,a muzzleloader dubble barrle rifle and yes even a gun completly made of wood witch I was not game to use but it does work. also shows you how to make basic gunpowder witch is poinless since even cavemen know how to make it.Also how to make basic primers.An allround good book for emergency and time of need.When there is no more gun stores and no factorys to make ammunition what will you use to protect the ones you love or will you revert to sharp sticks."
4,cool read,"I wouldn't recommend this book for anything other than entertainment, the risk of harming your self is great if any of the ideas presented at put to the test. that said it's very entertaining."
5,"Exciting, Incredible","Caroline B. Cooney's Mummy is a story about a sly girl who can get away with any security when it comes to stealing. One fateful night, Emlyn went into the museum to steal a beautiful Egyptian mummy. On that fateful night, everything becomes a failure. Caroline B. Cooney's Mummy is a vivid book, filled with excitement and adventure, it keeps you reading the book until you turn to the last page of Mummy."
2,Not Cooney's best,"Emlyn is a good girl. At least that's what everybody thinks until she steals a 3,000 year old Egyptian mummy from a museum for a high-school prank. But when the other members of her ""team"" forget about the prank part, she begins to wish it never happened.After reading other titles from the author, such as ""Wanted"" and ""Losing Christina"", I was disappointed with this book. This is not Caroline B. Cooney at her best. The plot is not that great, and the ending was a big let down. Also, there are many typos and editorial mistakes that I was surprised to see from a big company like Scholastic. If you are going to read Cooney, try ""Wanted"", but I would not recommend this one."
4,To Steal or Not to Steal,"If you love suspense and suprises, this book is for you. The title of this book is Mummy. The author is Caroline B. Cooney. The main character is Emlyn. This book is about Emlyn, who is dared to pull off a prank on Mischeif Night. Finally, it's her chance to do what she wants. Then, everything falls apart. I think this book should be recommended for a book to read over the summer for grades 6,7,and 8. I really got into this book. I was wondering what she would do each chapter and focusing on what the character is going through. I give this book 4 stars because every chapter is full of life and suspense. My favorite part was when Emlyn was trying to steal the mummy of Amarel-Re. She succesively sneaks past cameras, security guards, and her parents to make the steal possible. My favorite character was Emlyn because she has been wanting to do something bad for a long time and finally considers it. She is smart and is having second thoughts.She may be sly, but she is smart."
4,A good book,The Mummy is a good book especially if you like suspense and surprises. It's about a girl named Emlyn who gets challenged by her friends to steal a mummy for a prank but then when she tries everything goes wrong.This book has a lot of good parts first o f all you never know what's going to happen next because it takes a lot of unexpected turns. The second reason is because is it has a lot of suspense which I think is partly because of all the unexpected turns since your always wondering what's going to come up next.If you like suspense and surprises Then this book should definitely be on your list to read.
1,Mummy - Caroline b. Coony,"In my opinion, this book was slow, but later got exciting. I also think that the book could have been more scary and suspenseful, with more action taking place. To me this book was not an enjoyable read. I would not recommend this book to others. A good thing about this book is that it was realistic, and I like books with realism."
2,Mummy by Caroline B. Cooney,"The book Mummy by Caroline B. Cooney was exciting but it took a while to get to the important parts of the book. In my opinion this book could have been better written and had more suspenese and excitment. Every year the seniors pull a Halloween prank. This year Emlyn and her friends want to be original. They don't want to repeat something stupid such as putting the pricnsipals desk on the roof and letting the papers be blown free. They want this to be original, something that they thought of something that no-one else would think of doing. Emlyn , Donovaan , Maris and two other people thought that they should steal a mummy from the museum. Emlyn thought that this was a great idea but she had never done anything ""bad"" so she was doubtfull on pulling off this prank with her friends. Will Emlyn complete the prank with her friends? Will the prank be succesful?"
3,Mummy,The plot of this book was incredibly stupid. Really think about it who do you know that gets straight A's but is always dreaming of doing something bad. Seriously if you are doing that well you wouldn't do anything to jeopardize that status. Also one more thing who steals or tries to steal a mummy that in my mind seemed pretty dumb.
1,Mummify Emlyn and Keep Her Entombed!,"There is not a single character you can like except for the peripheral adult characters. Emlyn is a thoroughly obnoxious, unpleasant and completely implausible character. She is a stupid girl who has a stupid fantasy -- stealing the mummy. The kids who join her in this museum heist are equally detestable -- they not only threaten Emlyn, but they insist on sharing the booty they feel the mummy will yield. It has a slightly macabre twist -- the concept of grave robbing is always daunting at best, revolting at worst and yet the young marauders get off scot free. I wish Emlyn had been punished to the fullest extent of the law and her band of accomplices along with her. I hated Emlyn and found her to be a very unsympathetic character. I didn't like the book and felt the story was a complete bust. I'd like to see Emlyn entombed, never to be resurfaced."
5,The best!,"i think this is one of cooney's best yet. it's full of suspense, and not romance. that suits me well. and as for the characters, they come alive. you start reading it, and you won't stop.i suggest anybody who is ready for something a bit more than murder, romance, and a ready-made happy endíng read this!"
2,Mono Warning!,"Great singer, great selections, great recordings BUT many of the old songs are mono recordings. Wish I had read the fine print before buying..."
1,Monaural 'Master' is a waste of time!,"I'll be brief. 3 of the 4 CD's are mono. They are the first 3 which have the best songs on them. Motown named Marvin Gaye the Master here, then proceeded to diss him with this inferior mono mix job. Shame on Motown. Mono is for people with one ear."
3,How to invest in self storage.,"This book provides a simple introduction into some of the factors to be considered for investing in a self storage facility. It should not be considered as a complete guide; however, is a very adequate introduction. It was a well done book and is well worth its price."
3,Overpaid,Overpaid for this book. I trust Amazon but I need to remember that supply and demand dictate prices. The book cover price stated $20.00 which I did not know until I received the book. I paid about $47 for a gently used book.A small price to pay for a reminder lesson of trust but confirm everything. Best of wishes to other investers buying this book.
3,Better Instructions Needed,"The design selection and pictures were decent, but more detailed instructions are definitely needed, even for an intermediate beader."
2,Not what I expected.,"If you are expecting to find a book full of ring projects that you would love to make and wear, or high graphics, you are going to be sadly disappointed. There were only 3 or 4 patterns that would even be worth my time attempting. Not worth the money I spent for it...."
2,What the.......?,"I waited months to see this movie after I heard Synapse films was putting it on dvd. I really like most of the movies Synapse puts out like STREET TRASH, THE DEADLY SPAWN, & BRAIN DAMAGE are some of my fav horror flicks. So I bought this movie right away. Battle Girl looked like a cool cheesy horror/sci-fi movie and it's NOT! I didn't even finish watching this movie! Yeah, that's how boring it is. GORE? NO! ACTION? NO! COOL PLOT? NOT REALLY. K-ko ( Cutie Suzuki) a Japanese Pro Wrestler plays Battle Girl and let me say I have seen better acting in porn. WOW. Pro Wrestling in japan must be waaaaay different because this Battle Girl can't even throw a punch! I would hate to see her in the ring. lol.If your looking for a Gory goodtime from japan get ""RIKI-OH THE STORY OF RICKY"" Synapse films should be ashamed of putting this crap on their lable. Save an hour of your life and just watch Godzilla."
4,Handy tool,"Holds even the larger logs, when used with two hands. A little hard for one handed use, yet has plenty of reaching ability"
4,Not Bad,"For the price, these tongs served its purpose. I used them heavily on a camping trip over the course of two days with 1/2 a cord of wood. They bend out of shape slightly but thats because they are small."
1,Broke in three days!,"I was happy with the way these tongs looked, and they seemed fairly sturdy...but they actually broke within just a few days of them arriving at the house! One of the screws holding the tongs together snapped in half and popped out. My husband was able to fix it by replacing the screw...but I was pretty disappointed that my $12 was a waste!"
2,disapointing,"I purchased a used copy of Monico Grand Prix and was very satisfied with the service provided for buying used games. However this version was not compatible for use with my Sega racing wheel, and the Sega people were unwilling or unable to help me configure my racing wheel with the game. Be careful about compatibility when you purchase used games! Playing a racing game with a regular control is a real bummer.Terry Moore"
3,Not for everyone,"Even my son who can chew up a whole day trying to master a game got board trying to keep the cars on the track. There is no true novice mode for this one. We don't have the Sega wheel yet, and that my have a big influence on our first experience. Compared with the out of the box experience games like ""Ready to Rumble"" give you, there is no comparison. If your an experienced game racer, this may be it for realistic racing. Otherwise, I would pass or rent it first."
3,"Graphics are great, but the steering is TOOO sensitive","The graphics on this game are outstanding. However, it's way to hard to turn and brake at the same time. Even using the steering wheel controller, the car is very hard to control when its going over 60kph."
3,"Full Throttle Start, Loses Speed Quickly","Put this game in the Dreamcast for the first time and prepare to be amazed. Put it in for the fifth time and prepare to fall asleep. This game has impressive graphics, but the setup screens between races are confusing and not user friendly. After playing this game for about a week, I grew tired of its repetitiveness and had to take it to a used games store. Just gets old."
2,Good but....,This review will be very short. I read all three Age of Misrule Books and enjoyed the series. I must say the Dark Age books were enoyable they kind of dragged. What I enjoyed the most were the Celtic myths coming back and how the mordern world adjusted to them. What I hated the most was the left you hanging feeling in the third book and last book of each series.
3,Super Reader,"A new trilogy following on from the Age of Misrule. It is set some time in the future, and some of the earlier Brothers and Sisters have aged or moved on.There is a government, and some form of organised resistance, but this book centers around Mallory, your hard nut rogue crim type. He falls in with a band wanting to re-establish the Knights Templar. They, of course, are dodgier than they look.Mallory has to deal with monsters and madmen as he discovers he has a higher purpose than the graft, to put together a new Dragon sibling superteam."
5,"A dream, shared","Kenneth Patton had a dream of a religion based on the humanism that underlies all religions, and inspires the poetry, art, music of humankind. Now that he's gone, and his Charles St Universalist Church turned into a commercial building, we probably need his ideas more than ever. Most of his many books are going extinct....which is as sad as the extinction of so much of our natural world he loved.Scotty Zilinsky"
5,A Must!,"Motown comes correct on this one.Great Music by Stevie Wonder,Willie Hutch,The Jackson 5,Marvin Gaye,Eddie kendricks,etc..the music here Represents one of Motowns Greatest Years&great Quality of Artists&Music.a Must Have."
1,not vey interesting,"very slow, didn't care much for the main characters. Plot was not to my taste. I was very disappointed in it."
2,Simon Said,"Well, I suposse I can say ""it was ok"", but that's all. Actually it was an easy reading but rather dissapointing. I 've read much much better crime stories."
4,Surprised,I thoroughly enjoyed this story and would recommend it. It is quick reading and keeps your interest. The character is so believable and does a remarkable job at having you follow his every move.
4,Congenial Company,"The main characters are congenial companions for the length of the book while the plot happily dispenses with the elaborate mystification and techno-jargon which impede the pleasurable jaunt through the brief trip we expect from a light detective/mystery. The author writes well, maintains adequate self-control to avoid sexual pot-boiling in her romance and provides just the right touch of Academic foolishness to spice the story.I feel comfortable in recommending this effort to most readers of what are now being called ""COZY MYSTERIES"". It should not disappoint others who share my taste for that type of fiction. As proof of my pleasure in this one, I will now turn to Amazon to buy the other four Kindle offers."
3,Murders and mystery from long ago and in the present,I enjoyed the way the author wove a historical mystery in with the modern mystery. I liked Professor Simon Shaw and will read more about him in the future. It would have been an awesome book without the sexual references...
4,Good Book,This book was really good but it did drag on longer then it was needed. Good story line but I highly doubt that a murder could be solved after so many years.
4,Simon Said (the professor Simon Shaw murder),Quick read book. Keeps your interest but is predictable. Enjoyable to read. It takes place in the south and reviews a murder that took place 70 years ago.
4,Discovery,This is a well written novel. Hard to put down.With just enough clues to make this puzzle interesting!!!Who really did it. You will never know until the last moment!!
4,A detective/academic with a vulnerable side..,"A main character with a strong sense of Southern pride and an interesting insight into the divide that still exists between the North and the South in the US. One of the things that intrigued me was how one of the teachers was teaching a version of the Civil War that insists slavery was not the real catalyst for the war. The Kindle version has a few minor formatting glitches, but nothing that disrupts the flow of the story. The main character is dealing with depression and learning to find his own voice. In the midst of all that he wants, no he needs to find out what happened to that young girl whose body has turned up after being missing for over 50 years. Simon isn't your typical detective type, the writer has created a person who is vulnerable and weak at times, but that endears him more to the reader. I found the text slightly stilted in places, but enjoyed the mystery and the read."
4,Academic Cozy,"Simon Shaw does not look the part of a Southern college prof.With his beard and messy appearance,he looks almost like a homeless man.Sarah Shaber has created an unlikely hero and an engaging mystery."
4,Compulsive Gambling Case Histories,"This was the first book that I ever read on the subject of compulsive gambling. That was over ten years ago, at a time when not much information was out there, and the book is still relevant today. It guides you through some very interesting case histories and the recovery of one of the authors. I liked reading all of the case histories because the subjects were from all walks of life with one common thread; their inability to stop gambling. Heavy emphasis is placed on the Gambler's Anonymous program as THE tool for recovery, but the book neither lectures nor preaches. It gives much food for thought, and left me wondering where many of the subjects are today. A valuable resource for someone interested in the topic of compulsive gambling."
4,Very attractive setup,"After taking this product out of the packaging I was very impressed with the looks of the system. Thankfully, setting it up was also VERY easy to do. Sound quality on DVDs is great, however there is one problem I'm having that I have yet to find an answer on. My wifi connection to my laptop shuts off completely when the system is turned on. This is clearly a problem if I am thinking about using the internet while watching a movie (which I'm prone to do). Also, there is a buzzing from the rear speaker when playing xbox360, and I suspect this is either interference from my wifi router or the wireless controllers (I believe they run at 2.4ghz as well).Looks and sound quality are top notch for a HTIB and with easy setup like this and a great price it's a pretty easy buy. Just beware video games and wireless internet is my advice. Hopefully I find a way to fix this.. :("
2,Upconvert?,"First of all I should have stuck with sony, Phillips though the sound is good. The DVD doesn't unconvert, or if it does it won'ton my TV. My $79 toshiba does as does my Directv receiver...... Also selecting the source is a pain, it loads incredibly slow and you can't see anything on the display.PRO's - looks and soundCon's - price, inability to unpconvert (yes I used HDMI), Slow and not user friendly"
1,WATCH OUT Product Service is TERRIBLE,"DONT BUY THIS SYSTEM UNLESS YOU PLAN NEVER TO HAVE A PROBLEM OR CALL CUSTOMER SERVICE!!! Before buying this system, I called Philips to find out some information about it (which I thought was very responsible on my part). Their call center is in the Philipines, and they not only knew nothing about the system, and (understandably) had difficulty with technical terms in English, but they had this really obnoxious script, so even though it was clear right away that my questions were way over the customer service agents head, it was like pulling teeth to get transfered to a manager then to technical support (no kidding over 20 minutes educating some poor customer service girl on HDMI, speaker wattage, and DVD upconversion). When I got the system, I learned (as I somewhat expected), that even the tech knew nothing about this system and was working off of the same product specs I read ten times before buying it, then just saying ""Yes."""
2,No Storyline,"I was disappointed in this book. What could have been an exciting account of the exploits of a very brave and innovative corp of British volunteer desert fighters was a collection of brief and disconnected accounts of battles and skirmishes during the war in Africa. Very little detailed description of the actual battles, some of which were obviously significant, with many men being lost or solid victories by these brave troops."
3,a collection of episodes,This book gave a good insight into what life (and death) was like for members of the LRDG during WWII. However it was a collection of not very well-linked episodes rather than a coherent book. Nonetheless I enjoyed it because I had an uncle in the LRDG and learned from it a lot about what life must have been like for him and his fellow troops.
1,Not what I thought,"Thought this was going to be a good history of the Long Range Desert Group but was very sad when I read the book. The book has no details of the unit, tactics or history of operations. It reads much like an interview with members of the group. You get a lot of ""we got in the trucks and drove 1000 miles then we returned and I was sent to a new unit"". I would not buy this book if you wanted to learn any real history of the unit."
2,Cheap,I wanted something that could zoom and this was in my price range. Well it looked and was cheap. Plus made a nosie the hole time and the pic was just bad!!! Spend the extra $$ and get a good one. You can get some under 100.00 but no zoom. I did that =]
5,Developing zen in your daily life.,"I've been on a thirty year search for a book like ""Sweeping Changes"". Although, I've read a lot of books on zen, only a few seem to capture zen's true essence. Gary Thorp, author of ""Sweeping Changes"", is able to convey this zen essence to his reader. He writes of bringing mindfulness into all aspects of daily living. But Thorp does this without being prescriptive. Instead, after reading (or shall I say savoring) a chapter of ""Sweeping Changes"", you find yourself inspired to bring your entire presence to the task at hand; whether it is sweeping the kitchen floor, taking care of the kids, or addressing a challenge at work.For now, ""Sweeping Changes"" will have a special place on my book shelf; a place where it comforts me with its very presence of zen."
5,"a joy to read,","I've seldom read such kind hearted and helpful wisdom as Gary Thorp offers in Sweeping Changes. Read this book and then watch the everyday ""ordinary"" moments of your life become embued with meaning and deserving of profound respect. You'll never look at dust or think of water in the way you once did. I feel compelled to give my small review as a way to help this book make it's good way into the wide world. With deep bows to Gary Thorp. I hope you have a second and third and fourth book in mind..."
2,Bit preachy,Try Ferdinand The Bull by Munro Leaf instead...a much better buy as this one is rather preachy and teachy (as they say).
5,Bloodnok Learns How to Behave and Why !!,"I originally purchased this book for my grand-daughters (aged 3 to 15 yrs - 5 in all)), in the hope that it might provide simple guidelines for the younger ones. On Christmas Day they all read it, one by one, with the y3 yr old asking to have it read to her !!!!!It is our second copy - we keep one at our house as a ""coffee table book"" for younger visitors (originally). Many of our adult visitors also feel compelled to have a bit of a look.An excellent book as a gift for younger families, and an excellent ""coffee table book"" for all."
2,average,"Cute titled book, but not really that useful. My expectations were a little higher for this book and thought it would actually add some value to take away and actually teach some manners or good behavior. Maybe the book is intended for a child younger than my six year old. We read this book once and probably will not read it again."
4,Very good book,"This book is simple and to the point. The artwork is stick figures so the kids seem to actually listen more than getting distracted by the pictures. I read it to my 7 & 8 yr. olds, and they enjoyed it, and it prompted some good discussions. We just read a chapter of a few pages each night and then talked about it. It's been a month or so since I've read it to them, so I think we'll read it again soon."
4,Generation-Friendly Guidelines,"I bought this book after hearing a passage read on TV; I liked what I heard and ordered it online sight unseen. When I received it, I believed that it was a little beyond my three-year-old grandson's range. I felt it needed more artwork to be visually appealing to a toddler. However, I kept it anyway because I liked the pragmatic way the book explained mores and values. My daughter took it home and reads it to my grandson at bedtime. Obviously, she didn't think it was too early for him to hear ""how to behave and why."""
4,Great read for the whole family,"Ordered this to address the white lies that my kids have been telling. We have been concerned that the behavior might escalate. Both my husband and I read the book first. It was a good refresher for us as to the ""talking"" points for appropriate and trustful behavior. The kids read it and it was right on their level (they are 7 band 10). We had positive discussions and I think it is something we can keep referring back to as the need arises--for a few years anyway."
3,o.k. Leans toward secular humanism.,"Now we certainly read this one often. Kids' ages are 6 and 3. 6 likes it very much, 3 listens a little.I would say the book trends toward humanism, as if our highest goal in life is to be self-actualizing and happy. Being happy is a BIG THING in this book. Be HONEST, be STRONG, be FAIR, be WISE, and you will be HAPPY.I read the book word-for-word until I get to page 56, which instructs us to make no value judgments among cultures. I replace the text with ""We are blessed to live in freedom and prosperity. Counting our blessings is a way to be wise and happy."" I actually stuck a sticky note on the page so Gramma can read it the same way.But you know, we like the book. And it works out o.k. with our other manners-oriented and raising kids books. Just know, going in, that the drive is to be HAPPY.** Added October 2008 -- I would recommend Hermine Hartley's book ""Manners Matter"". Cheers!"
3,"some good ideas, some not; dated language","Overall I like the sentiments offered in this book. But a) it was written a long time ago and you can tell. It just sounds old-fashioned and dated. b) The reading level is for younger kids, but it seems geared towards slightly older kids, and it's not quite right for my 8 or 5 year old. c) I didn't like the ""always obey your parents and do what they say because they know better than you do"" language/tone in the last section. Nor the times when he says things like ""and doing that would just be stupid"". We have enough of kids taunting each other with such language without a book on how to behave using it too.On the positive side, the messages about honesty and fairness were good ones, and probably received better from a book than from a parent."
3,too long for 6 and 5 year olds,"I think that the lesson is a good one and something that every child needs to know, but its also a little long. My boys didn't have the patience for it. They were ready to go to the next thing after about half of it. I enjoyed it more than the kids."
1,Broken one.,"I received this from Amazon. They shipped it via Eagle USA, their specialty carrier. It had the LCD broke. It even included a spyder web on top! I've been waiting for more than a week now for Eagle to pick it up. I also received last month two defective Panasonic 50"" Plasmas (from Amazon's warehouse_deals) and had my patience tested by Amazon. With the last order I also got a 46"" LCD Samsung. It worked!!!!!! 1 out of 4 TVs in good condition. No wonder Jeff Bezos is not making any money?"
4,Great bang for your buck!!,"Excellent tv for the price. Haven't got HD thru directv yet, but I'm very happy with the picture non-HD. I would recommend getting home theater speakers with it as the speakers on the tv are good but not great. Remote control is easy to use. Overall, I'm very pleased with the tv in the short time I've had it."
4,Solution to connect a PC,"I agree with the reviwer that found poor the RGB port to connect a PC, but let me tell you that it was the only weakness I found myself with this TV, and the solution is a HDMI to DVI cable, and it works great a full resolution using of course the DVI output of your video card."
4,Very Comfortable And A Great Idea For Travel!,"I have one of these and made the mistake of not taking it with me when I took a very long overseas flight and back. I got absolutely no sleep. If I had just dumped something else out of my carry-on bag and put this in instead, I would have had a chance to sleep at least. I thought at the time that it would be cumbersome at the airport, but it would have been worth it.The pillow is well made, comfortable, and has lasted for years.However, if I were buying again, I would get a very small Tempur-Pedic pillow that is a normal shape not the neck bump thing. I think that would work better for me. Not much of a difference, but I think I might like the regular shape just a tiny bit better."
5,smaller size pillow,"This pillow in the smaller size is perfect for me. I'm 5'2"". Love it but was hard to get used to sleeping on my back, but I feel better in morning."
3,Could be great,"I've had this wallet for over a year now and I really like it for everything being in the right place, for having a coin pocket (why are those so rare?) and for it's nice, smooth leather. Not so great however is that the coin pocket has a divider what makes finding coins really hard and helps 'bulging' and especially that the wallet is just a little too small to fit notes in there straight. I mean it is theoretically possible to fit bank notes in there without crumpling but that requires a lot of patience - something i don't have when I am at a checkout. So the notes always end up in the wallet folded or completely crumpled, displeasing me the next time I need to pay for something.I am still giving it three stars for it's nice appearance but actually I would rate it depending on my mood and the current situation between one and three stars."
5,Transformers Old Skool,"Wonderful! My son is 5 and LOVES these! Wish we could get all the seasons on his Kindle Fire. A+. If more become available in the future, we will definitely get them. Easy and hassle-free to download."
2,Interesting concept but poor animation,"For some reason Transformers has always intrigued me. Part of it I think is because of the voices and sound effects and of course the whole concept of the transformations of everyday objects into robots that think for themselves. However the animation is of the poor quality that seems to be in the majority of television and direct to DVD projects.With the recent release of the theatrical movie I was curious to find out why I liked the original cartoon so much (me being a middle aged adult). The basic premise is good against evil, the survial of the earth and its inhabitants. My original draw to the series (reasons stated above) still stand but I seem to be more aware of the production short comings this time around.Young children seem to like the whole robot thing and enjoy this cartoon series. But be aware that some of the story line can be somewhat violent and frightening when the ""bad guys"" Decepticons are involved."
3,For the First Generation Only!!,"Well I bought this DVD collection because I loved the first movie so much, and I'm excited for the upcoming Revenge of the Fallen. This is a nice collection if you grew up watching this. I find myself being very bored by the episodes. Each one usually has the same outcome,(""DECEPTICONS RETREAT!!!!) lol. It is pretty cool to see the cartoon versions of the Autobots and Decepticons have the same personalities they had in the movie though. This would be a good gift for a child or someone who grew up watching the cartoon. I would NOT advise you to buy this if you are in between like me.The Collection does come with some nice DVD extras. Old transformer toy commercials, PSA, and an AUTOBOT magnet. The picture and sound quality is top notch so in that aspect, its good. But don't buy this collection if your looking for some ACTION! but it is a nice collection for a child or someone who just wants to Relive their Childhood!!"
5,great buy!,"This was an exellent buy for anyone who grew up watching this show. It brings you back to the good old days of the quality programming we had when we were kids. Dvds were great, it was fun to see the interviews & old toy commercials on the bonus disc. If you liked this show when you were a kid, you will definitely appreciate it now."
5,Transformers G1,If i was alive during the 80's this would be my favorite show . I saw Transformers 2 a month ago and i give it four stars. It is my third favorite movie now this is far better than armada and energon so buy this on dvd.
5,Stroll down memory lane for me and a introduction for my boys,"I GREW UP WITH THE TRANSFORMERS. SO WHEN I HEARD THEY ARE ON DVD , I JUST HAD TO BUY ALL THE DVDS. IT ALSO HELPS THAT I HAVE TWO BOYS. SO BOTH MY BOYS AND I WATCH THEM.MY BOYS LOVE THEM"
4,Only one thing missing...a magnet.,"I owned this product once before, long story short needed funds. I have now repurchased this item and I was a little surprised that there was no magnet (autobot logo) in it. I guess I should count myself lucky that I kept the one from the first one by accident.Anyway my point is it should be made more clear somehow, I don't know if this is a second run or what, why no magnet?"
5,maxed my income potential,"this book taught me some great things that will help me max my income potential. it had a lot of accompanying material that you might have read somewhere else. but if not this would all be useful and if you had read it it would be a good review.there is enough that i never found anywhere else to justify buying this book just for that. indeed, it was the special material i found when browsing at the bookstore that convinced me to buy it.this book is for all of us who are not yet in the top tier with bob bly, jeffrey lant, ted nicholas, jerry buchanan, et al.ordinary self employed consultants and free lance types should read this book. it is worth the time and the money. reread it every few years to keep the material in mind for active usage.unless you like making less than you are worth you need this book."
3,Warning: audio CD is not the complete album,"Just a warning, it may not be obvious from the packaging or the reviews here that the audio CD that accompanies this DVD contains just 8-9 tracks. It is not the same as the original album ""Songs from the Labyrinth"" that has 23 or 24 tracks! The DVD is very cool, but I wished I had noticed that the music CD was not the full original before I took the packaging off (and the brick-and-mortar retail store would not accept it back for exchange!)."
4,The Journey & The Labyrinth: ---A real Journey,"this was an awesome work. The music was great, and the documentary...really interesting.if you love music or you are an artist, this is inspirational and entertaining.this project was a wonderful surprise!!"
4,A must have for all Star Wars Fans & those who like monopoly,"A Must Have for all Star Wars Fans and those who like Monopoly game. I'm looking forward for the updated version or Monopoly Star Wars Episode I, II in PC(CD-ROM) version."
2,This Game Stinks Unlike the movies.,This game has horrible graphics and cannot get any worse.. It's also slow and boring.
5,A MUST READ,"If you have any interest in history or Roman Catholicism, you MUST read this book. The author couldn't be more informed, well studied, and passionate about the topic. I found myself excited to turn each page as I read this well cited account of Roman Catholicism."
1,Selective quotations?,"How could the author write a book and try his very best to find support for his doctrines coming from the Early Church Fathers?By carefully selecting a phrase from their writings to make it appear that it supports the author's version.Right on! if you are fair and honest man eager to find out of what the Early Church Fathers truly teach I suggest read their Book (by Jurgens) and writings by themselves and find out for yourself and NOT from these guys (including this author) who had selectively quoted one phrase and try to distort it to fit their own wicked ideas.I just blew out my mind of how could someone like this author read the Early Fathers and christians and make his conclusion that they were protestants, WOW!Just a hint, all of the Early Church Fathers practiced and participated in worship of Liturgical in Nature and their respect and obedience to their Bishops and of Church's Authority was so glaringly EVIDENT!"
1,Great Use of Selective Quoting,"Any one interested in this owes it to themselves to read Steven Ray's UPON THIS ROCK which scholarly illustrates through extensive footnotes how Webster uses selecting quoting of each church Father to make his anti-catholic points unless of course you've already made up your mind ahead time. In numerous cases, as Steven Ray illustrates, Webster does not ever consider the whole body of each Father's work but merely quotes the material that appears damaging but selectively omits writings by same church father that does not support the protestant position. Consider the the Epistle of Clement I (96 A.D) which uses the words to Church of Corinthians ""SEnd...Back"" - This is a form of Imperial Roman terminology commanding performance. Ray shows how Corinthians 150 years later were still reading Clements letter outload at church according Church father Dioysius (A.D 166 -175)who was Bishop of Corinith."
5,It really works!,"This fixed a fairly deep scratch to a CD I just bought, which I accidentally damaged while putting the CD back in the case. I've also used this to fix every damaged DVD I've rented from Blockbuster. No more returning movies because they skip. Fixing a CD or DVD takes only about 5 minutes."
1,Don't waste your're money if you want info beyond Notes 4.6,"Don't waste your're money if you want info beyond Notes 4.6. The Notes 5.0 early beta used in this book briefly, is just that. The info is really irrelevant to the gold 5.0 release. Change the title of the book, they should not promise Notes 5.0 info because it just does not measure up."
2,Poor examples & Incomplete explanations,"If you are looking for a book that gives you an overview of Domino's web capabilities then this book is for you. But if your like me, looking for a book that provides real world solutions and thorough explanations of code examples that can be modified and reused, this book has very limited use. I found far better code examples / explanations for free on the Web."
1,Very disappointing - it was neither advanced or about R5,"It was very light on anything R5 and, as pointed out by other reviewers, early beta versions. A better title would have been R4.6 Web programming for Domino."
3,A great book for developers learning about Notes and Domino,"I've been working as a senior Notes developer and administrator for over 6 years. This is a great book for beginning and intermediate level Notes developers. It shows just how diverse Notes development can be. It is lacking in one important area that is very important to Notes development. That is the Notes @Functions and @Commands. Without a good understanding of the Notes macro language, new developers are at a serious disadvantage. Over all, this book is worth having in the library."
1,Disappointing,"I had high hopes in reading this book - ideas for developing applications in Notes 5. I found the book not only confusing, but incomplete and inaccurate. If I could return the book I would, but I opened the CD."
5,I did not know you could do that?,"I have been developing in Lotus Notes for several years now. I thought that I had found every trick that there was. This book should me sample code that I have never thought of. I also love to see what I can do with mixing java, javascript, and Domino. The chapters that were spent on this aspect was very well written and easy to understand as a programmer. It was great to see the new areas in Release 4.6 and 5 that I can use to really spice up things. I am not talking about the new @functions but rather the new java classes and corba features.Great book!"
1,worst buy ever,Words can't even express what I think about this product and the companyWe received our package and after opening it the main board was dented that the plywood came through.So after a lenghty process the return board was send.That was very well wrapped and after opening it the new board was in worse shape than the one before.this product is not worth any ones time and the company not trust worthy.
4,looks great,"I bought this table for my flat screen tv and liked the 2nd shelf for holding cd's, etc which looks great. However, since I'm only one person I don't like that it took several people to put this item together. It was far more complicated than it looks in the picture. Had I known this I might have looked to buy one assembled."
4,sturdy little shelf,Sturdy and attractive...putting together was a little tricky but not bad. I have 30-40 cook books on it and it's holding them all well.
4,Got to give it up...,"I paid $23/US for this disc. My favorite on this collection is the 7:20 version of ""Bustin' Out."" But, the other extended cuts are quite good! The list is as follows:1. Got to give it up (Marvin Gaye: 11:48)2. Square Biz (Teena Marie: 6:23)3. Brick House (Commodores: 6:11 - A rare find!!)4. Bustin' Out (Rick James: 7:20)5. She's just a Groupie (Bobby Nunn: 7:07 - I forgot about this song!)6. All Night Long (Mary Jane Girls: 5:34)7. Let it Whip (Dazz Band: 6:11 - Great extended version)8. Gigolette (Ozone: 6:40)9. Machine Gun (Commodores: 2:40)10. Boys (Mary Jane Girls: 5:45)My rating: Four stars!!"
2,A Tight Fit for adults.................,"I was disappointed that this bootie is labeled extra large and only fits a medium shoe size. It will not fit over a man's shoe at all. That is infortunate because most men have a regular 9-10 shoe sizes or larger. It is misleading that the information given here leads you believe it is bigger. Also, it is not skid proof, you must be careful because you do slide around. I hope this helps someone else to make a better choice. The kids love them, they fit great for them and they can skate and slide around the floor."
3,Not non slip,There really is no gripping non slip type things on the bottom. I bought these because I got new really light carpet and I don't want people to walk in my home with shoes on so the easiest way is to put the booties on their feet. I asked several of my friends how they felt if I asked them to put the booties on and everyone felt no problem with that request. I have never worn shoes in my home (don't know why just never have). My old carpets were 38 years old and the only reason I replaced the carpets was because I wanted to update the color and get rid of carpet on the stairs and replace it with oak. I got the idea of the booties from a service person who came to my home and put the booties on before walking in my front door it was so fast I hardly even notice him put them on. I liked the fact that the company felt that it was important to be thoughtful of their customers. That is how my idea was born for my home......lol
1,Made of paper,"Smallish covers, made of cheap material like a vacuum cleaner filter dust bags, but even thinner. The picture on this site is misleading, the covers do not cover that much (at least half of foot). Do not try and cover your boot, It won't fit and will cover only the sole, mostly. These covers will not prevent passing of bacterias in or out of boots. It's useless. If you don't trust me, buy it. The covers are cheap piece of cloak made of papyrus or something like that. They will skid also."
1,booties,these arent plastic booties for service work medical maybe but these are junk dont buy them plus they willnot fit over boots.thumbs down they suck.
1,Insulting and Disappointing,"Broken Feather? What a stereotypical title. As a Native American I am disappointed by children's books like this written by others who think they have a grasp on what Native American culture is all about. This book is yet another example of the cluelessness of authors who are trying to make a buck on something they have no business writing. It ranks right up there with the awful depiction of Disney's animation ""Pocahontas."""
4,Cool and Easy,"I bought it in a hurry way because I got a problem with one DVD, wich is my favourite one... ""The Matrix"". So I got quickly and I can It has worked in an exellent way, I think. The fact is that the product is easy to use and fast, it doesn't get on troubles to the eldes't member of the family... generally, they suck using electronics. So, I recommend it to you in case you're very angry with your broken DVD's."
5,Epic Win!,I was one of the lucky few to see this at the end of last year at a horror movie festival in Wales where I was fortunate enough to be able to meet Lloyd himself at a masterclass and sit next to him during the UK premiere of the film.This is Troma gold and by far the best Troma film I've ever seen and this DVD deserves a place at the forefront of not only every Troma fan's DVD cabinet but EVERYONE's DVD cabinet.
5,am i the only one hungry for more?,"poultrygeist is at times completely inappropriate and offensive, but what great movie doesn't offend at least one person? the premise of this movie alone is simply genius. the climax with all the chicken zombies is one of the greatest things i have ever seen in my entire life. and to top it all off, there are musical numbers! this is definately a must have for any horror movie fan."
5,dgtl thermostat,"has made my life easier, no more leaving for work with A/C on, come home to cool house, and has helped bill alittle, summer is just starting and I live in desert, very hot so it runs most of day but does come on and off at night. Nice!"
1,Don't waste your money,"This thermostat is poorly designed. The sensor for air temperature is affected by the heat generated by the relays. When the cooler is not running, the sensed temperature is about 2-3 degrees lower than when the cooler is running.A calibration tool is provided so you can choose whether the correct temperature is sensed with the cooler running or off."
1,Dial 7619,"This ia an atractive easy to use thermostat. The fact of the matter is it SUCKS to have to wait 7 minutes for the fan to come on. They state that is to pre wet the pads. Well it only takes about 30 seconds actualy to wet them. The truth be known, they designed it that way so it dosn't cycle on and off to frequently when it gets to the desired temperture.It would be wonderful if they would design it to overide the delay on start up. I would be willing to pay an additional $20.00 for that improvement."
4,another great book for my daughter,Alice Hoffman was a recent author I came across and I was surprised to see she wrote a book my daughter was familiar with (movie-Aquamarine) and got her to read the book. It is nice we can read the same authors.
3,Somewhat Wonderful,"As much as I enjoy Alice Hoffman, I felt the stories in this book just didn't live up to her usual wonderful writing. Aquamarine wasn't her best, but Indigo proves to be far better. Read this collection if only for the story Indigo which had some really interesting twists on Mermaid legends."
5,Whole Lotta Songs,"3 Concerts, 2 Eras: Riot Act and Avocado ( Untitled ) Rare, stunning, dynamite!!! Real Grunge, Vedder better than Ever!! Great Selecction... Lots of music for diferents moments... and Acustic songs!!! buy it.. dont think... buy it.!!!"
5,Pure Excellence.,Just get it!! This is a great set of shows. All three shows are great!! The music is great and the atmosphere that Eddie Vedder creates is awesome!! Enjoy it!
2,Much better than Live at the Garden but.....,"This is another millionith Live cd from Pearl Jam. The vocals are better than the last few years, the songs are the same as every other LIVE dvd/cd, and you get the same concert played three different times in this set so there is nothing new, just three versions of the same concerts. The concerts are boring as hell too, you have to wade threw all that garbage just to hear a TEN Song."
1,NOT MUCH WORTH IT,"IF YOUR LOOKING FOR ANY HELP FROM THIS BOOK, FOGET IT. IT WAS NOT WHAT I EXPECTED.NOT ONE PIECE OF ADVICE, EVEN OBSCURE ADVICE. SECONDLY,IT IS WRITTEN IN CARTOON FORM.BUT,THE CARTOONS ARE IN NO WAY FUNNY! SOME MAKE LITTLE SENSE AT ALL.AND,REFERENCE TO OBSCURE PLANETS IS PLENTIFUL, BUT NOT FUNNY AT ALL.THIS BOOK WAS LISTED WITH A GROUP OF VERY SERIOUS BOOKS ON THIS SORT OF SUBJECT,WHEN I DID A SEARCH. MAYBE AMAZON.COM SHOULD DO A BETTER JOB OF GROUPING THE BOOKS THEY SELL."
2,Don't waste your time,"This movie is just plain dumb. You can expect weak story lines in movies like this, but at least the sex scenes and nudity make up for it. In Dirty Blondes 2, even the sex scenes were weak! The Asian chick is pretty hot....but it gets slightly annoying watching her squirm, naked, in a camping chair for 15 minutes....just waiting for her to actually DO something. Overall it was quite disappointing. It wasn't even fun to watch when I decided to fast forward the whole thing. Don't bother...."
3,Sad,"I loved The Babylon file, but the second volume was a dissapointment. It's cynical, it gives me the impression that the author hates Babylon 5, it seems to say ""This is what I think, and I don't care what you think, because I'm right"", and parts are just proven wrong by the episodes. This is not the same quality of writing from the first book."
2,A P.O.'ed author is not a good author,"This book was a great disappointment. Babylon File 1 was a great book, full of insight and intelligent observations concerning everything from actors to dialog. Babylon File 2 is an episode guide from an author who hated the episodes. So Lane didn't like season 5. Oh well. So he delivered a horribly biased and grumpy review of the final two seasons. Granted, it is still a decent summary of seasons 4 and 5, but . . . Let's just hope by the time the omnibus edition of the two books comes out, Lane will have come to his senses and sucked some of the steam this book blows off back in."
1,Synopses good...the rest sux,"The synopses of the episodes were about all that were good about this book. A few reviews were ok, but most were horribly unfair to B5. Ok, so season 5 wasn't the best and was a little slow in the beginning, but it kept getting better. ANd now that I watch them again, they are even better. This is a serious disservice to B5 and I reccomend wholeheartedly against buying it."
2,Bewildering,"The author's episode by episode analysis is excellent. But the rest of the book is irrational. The author obviously was very disappointed in the last two seasons of Babylon 5, but his ravings outside the synopses make no sense, and clearly conflict with what he wrote in the synopses. When the author of a book can't agree with himself, there's a problem. It's unfortunate that there will never be a true sequel to the author's first volume of The Babylon File, which was excellent."
3,"A good, but not so great addition to Babylon Files series","A splendid attempt to give information about the information not covered by the first volume. However i found that book was very lacking in background information. I don't know if this was done to keep the book size/cost down or he lacked the nessary information to fill the pages. Many points were missed and details that first Volume had which made it great, were not in the second one. The essays and insight by actual actress of the show were great! Window to why things were happening the way they did. I give the book 3 stars out of 5. There was considerably less book for the dollar than previous vol had. Mr.Lane should have reviewed the series more closely if he didn't delibrately leave inforation out."
4,an honest opinion,"Certainly the book is overpriced and Andy Lane wears his bias on his sleeve.On the other hand I concur entirely with the opinions expressed, especially over the hanging plotlines, some of which had been dangling for two and a half years. Moroever, the book at least challenges the official opinion and is a welcome breath of fresh air for that."
3,Not impressed,Box came pretty beaten up. I couldn't get the phone to link to my computer. I think the cable worked though
2,Not what it is cracked up to be,"The info was not clear as to the limitations of this printer. It accepts single sheet feeds only and not stacks and this is not realistically implemented on the printer. It is only suited for tractor feed paper.Networking is problematic and required the services of a computer technician who struggled for four hours to get it working.The printer as a hardware device seems OK, but the software is sub par. Also, in a mixed Mac-PC environment, it makes what is already a difficult situation, even more difficult to implement if you want one printer for the network."
3,Pink Sheer Window Panel,"The opening for the end of the pole would not fit through the the opening in the curtain and I had to cut it. Otherwise, I was happy with all the curtains."
1,"Poor Quality, Wrong Color","I bought this product for my baby's nursery. I have been looking for pink sheer curtains for some time now. I didn't purchase this based on price, but saw the affordability as an additional bonus. Unfortunately the color was very much like a dusty rose, and did not match any of the pinks used in the nursery. It appears very old fashioned in color- definitely not the color portrayed in the picture. The quality of the fabric is poor, but would have sufficed if the color were correct. Side note, the price of shipping almost cost the same as the product itself. Go figure."
1,Disappointed,"I thought the color was fine, but they are poorly made. I was not expecting excellence for $10, but the seams were sewn incorrectly, leaving frayed edges, and the fabric was picked."
2,Cheap,These window panel are the equivalent of taken someone who cannot sew(umm me) and giving said person fabric and a needle. Just cheap! At least my daughter's room is light. Only plus is the sheerness of the window panel.
1,So off!,"I ordered my daughter a new bed set for her birthday and these curtains were suggested to go with it and purchased both items together to get the lower price. Once they arrived the curtains nowhere near matched like the pictures. I needed a brighter pink but they are what I call baby pink, very pale. Very disappointed the pic is so misleading!!!!"
3,wrong color for room.,"If you are looking for a ""pink"" these are not the curtains you want but they are good quality and the color is nice but not pink."
3,Returned,"I returned the rose pink sheers, they were the wrong color and I have not received credit on the card yet."
1,Disgusting,One star is too much! Don't be fooled by the color. They are really old musty pink. They are made in China. Arrived Dirty and moldy. Very disgusting.
3,okay for the $,For the price these curtains do the job. They do have kind of a musty smell when they first came out of the package but that went away. The color is not as bright as the picture looks.
2,Color pictured is inaccurate,"The color pictured is completely inaccurate. The actually color is a very muted pale light pink. It reminds me of my grandmother's ""nude rose"" lipstick. Doesn't match my decor!"
1,Not the right color as appears on picture;,"I was very disappointed with this purchase. The color is totally a different color it is definitely not the color as the picture on the internet. I would recommend getting a hot pink color, because this pink is way off, really wish i could have changed my mind:("
5,Hot Pink! Just like the picture!,"These curtains are super cute, my daughter is going to love them. For the price, I was not expecting anything great, but the quality is excellent and the color is very vibrant (hot pink, def NOT strawberry starbusrt!). They arrived way earlier than expected. Couldn't be happier with this purchase!"""
2,Not what I expected,This color is more like a dark pink rose. I'll put them in a room that I don't like in the future.
2,The First (and Last) Our Gang Feature,"With the 1935 success of Shirley Temple's ""The Little Colonel,"" producer Hal Roach believed that a Civil War vehicle would make an ideal feature debut for the delightful antics of Our Gang. Unfortunately, Spanky, Buckwheat and Alfalfa take a back seat to the adult leads in this well-made but rather hackneyed melodrama. Even worse, the Gang look awkwardly out of place in a period setting - an experiment Roach never repeated. The critical and commercial failure of ""General Spanky"" (1936) proved that short subjects were Our Gang's forte."
4,A Great Adaptation of the Play,"Paul Lukas gives a vibrant performance as a husband of German descent trying to promote peace during WWII. Although the film is most likely better than the stage play, it still is a little too Broadwayish and not always lifelike. Bette Davis is surprisingly only mediocre here."
4,Epic CD,"Although this cd sounds very different from Primordial's beginnings, I think they have matured into a great band. Nemtheanga's vocals evoke a variety of different feelings, mostly anger and despair. They're a great band, who I hope will continue to put out great music. If you're new to primordial I'd say buy this cd, but listen to some of their old work too. (4/5 stars because I don't think there's many cd's out there that truly earn a 5/5)"
3,interesting Metal,"This the first album I had ever heard form Primordial, it was recommendad to me as a ""good black metal"" album. Nevertheless the music in my opinion is far from black metal. I think the metal in general is good with great heavy sounds. I would classify this more as progressive heavy metal. Its a good album and a good recommandation."
5,One of the best....,This is a great cook book. There are so many wonderful dishes to choose from. It is a must have.
5,A must have cookbook!,"I went directly to Amazon and purchased this cookbook after borrowing it from a co-worker. It's a terrific find using modern-day, healthy products, such as egg substitutes and yogurt. All the recipes I've tried are especially yummy, and even better, provide guilt free eating! Cynthia Briggs, Cookbook AuthorPork Chops and Applesauce: A Collection of Recipes and ReflectionsandSweet Apple Temptations"
3,Not Free SF Reader,"A woman is involved in trying to bring one of the upper crust members of a society to justice. They have brain enhancing technology here, and this man has developed a method to basically become a brain sucker, a very nasty act of violence and depredation.She also gets to employ her kung fu skills in the process."
2,Only if you require a motorcycle game to surive !,I bought this game because I was drawn in by the great graphics. Which it does have. But I hate to say this game is so frustrating at times I almost broke my contoller ! Like I said the graphics are beautiful. The sound is great but you can't really hear the music to appreciate it. The gameplay however was created by the devil to start a war which will bring about the end time. One example is you'll be driving down the rode and all of a sudden your bike will explode into the sky and you will go flying off into the sunset. When you respawn 4 bikes have passed. You then take off only to smack into a wall and fly into the sunset again. Yes indeed this is hiliarious at times but when you trying to beat the game it isn't funny! SO stay far away unless you need something to get you angry enough to start a bloody rampage.
2,Suzuki Alstare Extreme Racing could have been a lot better,"Thnk about it: a motorcycle racing game with great graphics and sound. But the gameplay stinks.First of all, you have to race others through enviornments full of sharp turns and bends. This is where the control should come in handy. It doesn't. You have very little control over your motorcycle, and turning a sharp turn is very hard without crashing into a wall and blowing up. and when you blow up, you have to wait a 3 sec. while you get back into gear. But besides that, motorcycle games should be when you are able to fly through the level at high speed. Not in this one. You have to go slow. Very slow. to avoid crashing into a wall or blowng up. To make matters worse, there are LONG laod times, a lot of Pop-Up(I crashed because a wall popped up suddenly)Obviously, they spent more time on the visuals and sound effects than on gameplay. If you still wanna try this game, play it before you buy it."
1,Dreamcast ?,I wanted this game for a long time so I ordered it and it and the third party provider sent the wrong item. I never got the game.
3,what are you talking about,This game is not near as fun as other racing games I have played sure the handling is good and realistic but gameplay is just ok. I just didnt have the ambition to keep advancing in the game. I dont know maybe I just like the freedom of games that let you just cruise around like need 4 speed. the game was fun for all my little cousins. No thinking involved just go. Look for a different title if you want more than just racing but if you just want speed on a bike not a bad buy.
3,"Fun read, terrible typos","This was great fun, something light but catching. There were SO MANY typing errors that I finally started to highlight them... At least every other page."
2,not what i expected,"Very cute design but picture is deceiving. This ""lunch box"" is very small. It's more of a ""collectors tin"". Labeling it as a 'lunch box' is deceiving as you cannot fit enough food for a 'lunch'. The description says ""Tin Lunch Box"" which I took to mean it was big enough to use as lunch box and was made of ""tin"" as opposed to plastic or soft sided. Despite the measurements given, it's difficult to visualize the item and it turns out to be much smaller than it appears. I also disagree with some of the dimensions of the item. The description says it's 7.2"" long and the one I received was barely 6 3/4"" long ... a big difference when you plan to actually use it as a lunch box. Again, very, very cute item; colors and design are as indicated in photo ...it's just way smaller than it looks."
1,poor opera,"This is one very bad Werther, principally because Werther is sang in a very bad Way by this singer that is a marketing success. I think that this record would be ""perfect"" with Sarah Brightmann singing Charlotte and maybe the orchestra conducted by Andre Rieu."
4,Works fine - overpriced,Not disappointed. Suited purpose but for what it is made up of agree it is overpriced. Need four more words.
1,junk!,"What a hunk of junk! This is very poorly manufactured, assembles horribly. I ended up trashing it because it wouldn't click together right and it wasn't worth sending back. Next time, I will just set a $10 bill on fire, it would ne way more satisfying. Now, I just have to buy another rack for my Wii games..."
3,Cracked during assembly,"I purchased a few of these racks because I was looking for a horizontal DVD organizer for my TV stand, and this was the closest thing I could find. I found these difficult to assemble. The directions were simple, but I couldn't get the pieces to fit without cracking the plastic a bit. They work, but I don't expect them to last very long."
2,"CIA Bosses, not Field Officers !!","And this is the whole point of this book, nevertheless interesting and well written : Interviewed are only CIA former Directors. So it's really the Bosses pont of view rather than the field operative's one. Mislead by the title, I was not that impressed by the book content. Most of the stories are already old news (some interviews have been published at length), about overtold events such as JFK's assassination or the Bay Of Pigs. If you wanna hear it from the guys doing the actual work, stay away.I wouldn't have bought it if I had seen it on a shelf. But I guess it's one of the risks of online purchasing."
4,Interesting!,"I suppose all I have ever thought of the CIA is the mysterious ""wet ops"" assassination stuff. This book certainly gave me a LOT more insight!"
2,"Dark Blue,etc","Being a true blue movie lover of all genre, I rarely come across a movie that I truely don't like. I found this ""indie"" or foreign flick to have little to contribute to enjoyable viewing nor even just a story to tell. It is unbearingly slow and a bit difficult to follow. I don't think I have ever rated a movie, ""I Hate It"". I guess that's so because someone cared enough and found supporters to get it made that they feel they had a true contribution for us to contemplate. So, I will just leave it that,""I Don't Like It"", period."
2,Not Realistic for Test Preparation,"I scored in the 90th percentile on the ACT and now I prep others for it. This book is very unrealistic in terms of the actual test. Not only are many of the questions excessively difficult, but there are also topics included in the book that you won't even see on the ACT.If you want to improve your score and find out exactly what you need to know for the test, try Kaplan's book instead. The one with the CD Rom is awesome and the interactive environment is second best to the classroom itself."
1,Weird,"This book is not even funny. It is hopeless.I looked at the practice exams in this bookand ""tried"" to do them... but it'snot even worth it. Don't waste your timeon this book. The questions are weird andthe answers don't even make sense. Also,the sentences in the English section areso BADLY written that it's hard to solve theproblems... If you're looking for somethingto practice with, this is not your book.I tried the ACT practice booklet from theschool office and the two do not evenresemble each other. Look for something else."
1,Wrong Product. Returned it,I was looking for a wiring harness to allow you to use the F150 Helle Grille Replacement separate from the high beam connection. This is not an option.
2,An cursory look at China,"The text and pix of China were ordinary tourist stock photos. The back cover claims to include much tourist information, such as restaurants. There was less than 1 page of listings in the whole book!This book says Fodor's, but the book is actually produced by another organization which is probably why the book is substandard. I read this book at the public library."
5,You got to have this!,"I own all 1-6 series of Australia's Deadliest Destinations. They are educational and exciting. I am planning a trip to Australia next summer, this has help a lot."
5,Bold and Different,"I truly was surprised when I read this book--it seemed so unique compared to a lot of other romance novels. Treasure's intelligence as a main focus in the book made her stand out and shine, and I applaud Betina Krahn for this. I loved Sterling as well, although his haughtiness and arrogance irritated me. The book was well-crafted overall, and I really appreciated the great depth Ms. Krahn took in her descriptive details of everything. I have always preferred long, wordy passages to short and concise ones, because you can get a better personal feel for it. Passion's Treasure was remarkably unique, and I hope to read another novel that is equally stimulating someday."
3,A modern entertaining vampire show,"My view is based on the fact I am a big Michael Praid fan as well as a horror fan. The special effects were cheesy and there were errors in the film. You could tell when there was a real baby and when there was a doll. But all in all, I enjoyed the movie and bought it for myself. It's different from the other vampire flicks and I found it entertaining enough to purchase a used copy to enjoy with my family. If you like vampire flicks, if you like Michael Praed, or if you like scary movies although this one doesn't really count as that, you will enjoy this movie."
1,A pointless sequel that never should have been made...,To put it all in a simple word: STUPID!! How do you bring back the four characters that were destroyed in the first movie and put them in a second? You can't. You just hire a talentless screenwriter and hope people forgot about the first movie. This is why Brendan Hughes (from the first movie) quickly passed on this rotten egg. This movie made absolutely no sense whatsoever. Pread is a good actor but he should have passed on this one as his predecessor did. Wyss and Bond are so one-dimensional actors that their acting is laughable. Jay Underwood just makes you want to fall asleep in the first five minutes.
2,Plotless...,"It could have been much longer, with more of a plot. It was obviously edited way too much. The acting was average. The reason I bought this movie was because the gorgeous Michael Praed stars in it. He WAS great, but the movie went to fast and didn't last long enough. And to top it off, the most likeable character dies in the end. It depressed me! Unless you are a Michael Praed fan, DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!"
4,Solid...,A brief but solid introduction on probably Americas' greatest President Abraham Lincoln. No other President endured a Civil War and Lincoln found he could change in order to keep the country from spliting apart. He kept this country together and settled the issue of slavery that had was tearing at our country. He preserved the Union of this country till two days after the war when he was assassination by John Wilkes Booth.
1,"disappointing; poor safety information, illogical methods!","I had looked forward to this book. However, I consider the book a waste of money. The [book] ignores current safety information, and gives very inaccurate and wasteful lessons on perfume blending. Save your money for any one of a dozen better guides."
5,Great Knife!!,This is one of my favorites. Very well built and it last a long time. I bought another one for a spare.
5,The best knife,I have this knife for years I owned several different knives and this one is the knife I keep going back too.I'm a one-handed user and this knife works perfect for me
2,great knife but broke after only 2 months,fantastic knife great size and action but the safety latch that holds the knife blade into the body broke off after only 2 months.
1,DO NOT BUY THIS TOY!!!!!,"Save your money, this was a dud.I got this for my 5 year old daughter for Christmas. She loved it and played with it for 2 days. On the third day it just quit working . She did not damage it in any way. It just died... Waste of money & my daughter was truly upset!!!!!!!!! It Sucks."
3,Cute dog toy,"My 2 1/2 year old niece likes plaing with this toy. The puppy barks and walks which keeps her occupied for periods of time. She also enjoys sleeping with it. For the price, it was wirth the purchase."
5,Great for boys!,"We have three boys, 5-9. The stories are great for short attention spans...done in under 10 minutes...but they are ""meaty"" and the guys do like them. Would recommend this to anyone with sons ages 5-10 or 11."
3,Not for young boys,"The amazon description lists this book for ages 4-8. My boys are 4 and 6 and often the topics were much too old for them. We didn't want to read a devotional about parents fighting or divorce right before putting the boys to bed. I don't even think my boys know what divorce is. We'll save it and maybe it will be OK in a few years. For now, it is not for us."
2,Not quite getting it done for my boys,"I have been using this devotional with my three elementary age kids for about 6 who are currently 9 (girl) and 11 (twin boys). They don't seem to care much for it's approach. It seems like the stories are kind of contrived and they use really wierd analogies. I ffinally noticed that one of sons has been avoiding devotionals lately and trying to just ""go to bed early"" to avoid hearing these. Seems like a lot of good intentions went into this book, but then you know what they say about where most of those can lead you. We are moving on out to hopefully greener devotional pastures, I checked out a couple other ones like ""The One Year Book of Did You Know Devotions for Kids"", ""The One Year Book of Fun & Active Devotions for Kids"" and ""If God Loves Me, Why Can't I Get My Locker Open"". They seem like they will be a little have a bit more comfort and joy in them and encourage a bit more curiosity about God's word then this one did."
4,Very helpful,"My 7yr-old son and I have found this bible study guide to be extremely helpful. It deals with everyday issues that boys face at home, at school and everywhere. My son is able to relate to the stories each day and learn the word of the Lord on how to respond. More so, my son learns how to pray based on the stories. I would recommend this book to any parent who wishes to make the word of God relevant to a boy's life. The stories also helps me in parenting! It is worth every cent!"
2,"My Boy don't quite get it, I myself, didnt enjoy it.","This one was a though one for my son, if I compare it to God's Mighty Warrior. The book didn't get his attention at all and I have admit that personnaly I wasn't a fan either....it drags too much before it goes straight to the point and my son lost his focus. God's Mighty Warrior was so much better for us."
5,Excellent Choice for Any Preteen Boy,"The One Year Devotions for Boys has a sports theme on the front cover and at first I was afraid that the devotions would have a sports theme carried throughout. However, the stories inside the book are not written around any particular type of boy. Instead, the stories are applicable to any boy from any background with any hobbies or interests.This is really the perfect devotion book for an older elementary pre-teen who needs to develop a personal daily time with God. Not too long and easy to understand while providing additional scripture recommendations for anyone who wants more to study. A great introduction to daily devotions."
4,Best for boys 13 or older,"I bought this because a review said it was great for grade-school boys. I have a first grader who this WAS NOT appropriate for. I don't want my son knowing what marijuana is for a few more years yet, for example, and one devotional was about peer pressure to use it. I think that this book should be promoted as a book for young teens - 12/13 and up through maybe 15.I will be looking for another devotional for my son until then."
5,Anuthu Classic,"Just bought this CD yesterday and of course it's great. I've been gettin Mr. Pookie n Mr. Lucci CD's since the beginning. Not one mix, compilation nor solo CD is bad. This some real dope music for those that ride high. Still they, like most 100% real rappers, don't get enough credit for the dope music they put out. They're the ""ABN"" of DALLAS, TX!!!"
5,One of the best of the soul era,"Anyone who remembers the music of the late 50's and the sounds of the soul era must have this album. Smokey and the Miracles take you from the highs to the lows...alternately clapping and crying. Although not all of thes songs were tremendous hits, you'll remember them from somewhere."
3,"Didn't match expectations, but okay","Was told it was fabulous for legs on days when you seem to be on them ALL day. Well, it is nice. Tingling a bit as expected, but hardly a wow. So if you want an expensive lotion, go for it."
1,A Remake that Did Not Work,"This movie is a remake of a 1947 Bob Hope and Paulette Goddard movie, Ghost Breakers. Not only is the plot identical, many of the lines are exactly the same. What worked with Bob Hope deliviering the one liners and playing off of the attractive and suprisingly stalwart Paulette Goddard does work well with the sophisticated Martin and inane Lewis.If you are looking for a fun movie to watch with the family, try the original, Ghost Breakers with Bob Hope and Paulette Goddard. Unless you are a big time Martin & Lewis fan, Scared Stiff is best left on the shelf"
4,(-: good movie :-),"It almost ranks up with ""Jumpin Jacks"" and ""Artists and Models."" I think this movie had a stronger plot then some of their other ones. It's also great hearing Lewis doing his other voices, like when he's ""talking big"" to Shorty, and when he ""talks to himself"" with the mirror. I love the Enchilada Man song he does with Carmen Miranda too!...where do you think I got my internet name...?"
2,not for the ignorant!,"This is a typical book written by experts for other experts. I'm sure many readers will be like me: amateurs who need help in some of the basic techniques for digital imaging. This book does not provide that.I bought it basically to help with the use of layers to produce multiple images. In spite of reading and re-reading the relevant sections, I still have not managed to do just that. Perhaps it's me, but the fact that I have not succeeded suggests that the book fails in its primary object - to help the reader."
2,Not much about Layers,I bought this book with hope of help with creating layers.....not much help. The book is in a good format and has lots of info....just not what I was looking for.
4,Should be Required Reading,"I suppose everyone has heard that we are star dust, that we were born in the stars, but did you ever stop to wonder---is this really true? How did scientists ever find this out? How did they prove it? Magic Furnace will tell you how--in a most delightful way. In this book I learned that a great scientist can make a real wild guess at a solution to a problem, later find out it was largely wrong, yet even so, a part of his guess could lead to fruitful advances in the search for truth. Chown has that magic touch, the ability to tell a complex scientific story in conversational language. Should be required reading for every science student!"
4,What wonderful atoms!,"This book reminded me of ""Cosmos,"" the famous serial TV program which was broadcast in Japan and many other countries some twenty years ago when I was a junior high school student. As a boy interested in science, I would hurry back home from school and be nailed to the TV. The subjects covered by the program included the history of the universe and evolution of creatures. I was excited to know how nature had created us over a very long time. This book is more specific, and focuses on where the atoms which make up our bodies originally came from and how they were created. Don't you want to know that? I'm sure this book will wake up a curious child in your mind, just as it woke up mine."
5,Best Tubigrip,"This is the 2nd one that we have ordered, and so far we have had no problems at all. I have washed them a few times so my husband can reuse them, and they come back to the original size which is great!"
5,Good choice,I needed a light weight small size binocular for bird and concert viewing and these worked for me. I was also amazed to be able to see tiny insects on flowers that were not really visible without using the binoculars. I read many reviews on Amazon before purchasing these and am very happy with my purchase.
4,Bugnoculars!,"Hard to review given that apart from a few monoculars, it is the only thing out there like this, at the time of this writing. Given that, i give it four stars. A must if you are interested in insects/aracnids. Many close viewing uses. I have read on bino forums that at closest focus, the magnification is actually 10x. So, why not 5 stars.If you regularily use binoculars in the above $200 range, the image at non-close-up distances is not very sharp, and has alot of chromatic abberation. But that is normal for a regular binocular that is at the same price of this one."
5,WONDERFUL PRODUCT FOR A REASONABLE PRICE,"Great little Binocular! We are using it for bird watching, far mountain viewing, and just nature watching in general. Easy to use, and wonderful to have."
5,Great little glasses,"I bought the Pentax Papilio binoculars for when I go metal detecting. I own three other pair of binoculars (8x30, 7x50, and 20x60) but these are my main binoculars on a daily basis. I really love how I can view insects and lizards with them. I refuse to look at a spider with them because I think spiders are big enough with the naked eye. You will love these binoculars if you watch birds at a feeder."
4,read text messages,"More useful than standard binoculars because of close focus. While watching actors on stage, have fun seeing what people are text messaging several rows away. See the flower up close when it is high on the bush. Read the channel guide atop the TV in hotel room from bed."
4,Good closeup---not so good distant viewing,"I decided on these binoculars because of the rave reviews they received. And to be fair, they are very good for closeup viewing, as they do focus at about 1.5 feet! So, I was very satified with that. However, if you are looking for an all-purpose viewing binocular, I would not recommend them. At a viewing distant of say, 15-20 feet and beyond the viewing becomes blurry and distorted. Back on the plus side, they are lightweight, and easy to use. Bottom line: 5 star rating for close-up viewing and maybe a 3-star rating for distance."
1,Terrible,"Washed it immediately upon receiving this robe and it fell apart in the washing machine. Seams parted, huge balls of lint in washer, strings of thread all over. Had to throw it away before ever wearing it."
1,falls apart after 2 washings,"I was looking for a black robe because white ones fall apart too easily from bleaching. This one fell apart much quicker than a white one ever did, without the excuse of bleach. It's the shoddiest bathrobe I've ever owned."
2,poorly constructed,"When this product was purchased it took a little longer to receive than I thought was resonable.When item was received it appeared to be exactly what I was looking for, however after just two washings the robe is coming apart in several places,this product is poorly made. So my search for a decent robe for my wife goes on. I would not reccomend this product,very poorly constructed. I will have to think twice before I purchase anything from this supplier again."
2,All That She Can Be: Helping Your Daughter Maintain,"I was very disappointed with this book. I had read the great reviews, and it was a basic book that I didn't learn anything knew that I didn't know before reading this book."
2,All That She Can Be: Helping Your Daughter Maintain,"I was very disappointed with this book. I had read the great reviews, and it was a basic book that I didn't learn anything new that I didn't know before reading this book."
4,Good clean rootin' toot'n fun.,"Fun movie. Non violent, good performances, makes you cheer for the good guy. Saw this movie at a theater in downtown LA, it was well received with a good vibe amongst the audience once the credits rolled."
3,"Imagine That,A Good Western appears in 2012 !","A BURK BROS Film.This western is so true to the traditions of the Wild West,The real west not the REEL west .There is a desert,Real deserted not a effect and real horses and a real ghost town setting,See it can be done even with the little budget allowed for this film.The star is nicknamed `Bugle' and he can get in a duel or two or three...The fights are really the best scenes,A Gun duel with 3 mean cowboys and a sword duel with a mexican captain and a tomahawk duel with a real indian.That's another great point their are authentic( got tired of overuse of real) indians Playing the indians,Imagine that in a Hollyweird Western,Won't happen ever .Great effort,Hope it gets picked up for distribution somewhere,Deserves to be seen as a reference for bigger budget films.Oh,And in the grand tradition..'Bugle' is played by a former pro footballer like John Wayne and Alan Autry were former footballers...Something in the game reminds us of The Real Wild West !"
3,OK means OK,"It is a plain vanilla western, the native people are shown in negative way, story is a happy ending ""sing around the campfire"" kind of thing. DVD makes a nice coaster."
3,Love to Find the Bloopers !,"NOT the ""SEARCHERS"" by any means, but it beats watching another drug movie. I did notice a TON of bloopers just about halfway thru the movie. I need to watch more closely and view it again to catch more mistakes (that make the movie a tad more enjoyable). For instance..look for the ""plastic"" pour spout on the canteen, the Sgt. Major with no rank at all on his uniform, the modern western saddles, the stainless steel looking ribs on the gunrunner's wagon, NO wagon tracks in the sand despite Bugle's spotting the tracks with his spy glass from the top of the rocks, Bugle hollering for a anyone with the wagon when you can clearly see a Mexican holding three horses standing to the left of the wagon in plain view as he approaches, the flame shaped soft rubber light bulb on the candle, etc....If you enjoy looking for those mistakes then it's a fun movie."
5,My Daughter Loves it...,"and my husband and I like it too. It is a nice book for kids, but it speaks to adults too. Good lessons to be learned about conflicts and resolution."
4,Good,"The only thing I don't like is that if your LMP isn't on Sunday, it kind of messes with you. Also don't like how when you are 10 wks 1 day it shows you at 11 wks. I understand now, but was very confused at first. All in all its good."
3,"Okay, but needs improving","I like the calendar for the most part, but it seems pretty dated, and the stickers need some re-thinking. The last day of the calendar is supposed to fall on your due date, but roughly 1/3 of the stickers are for events that would happen AFTER the baby arrives (and there are also FIVE stickers that would all be stuck on the day you deliver, yet there is only room for one). While at the same time some things that might seems like milestones during the pregnancy or are likely to happen more than once either have no sticker or only one. Does the job for the most part, but needs an improved version. Also, I recommend waiting to get an official due date from your doctor before filling out all the days, instead of using the due date calculation they offer in the calendar. I had to go back and re-write the dates for the first two months."
5,Great Pregnancy Keepsake,"I had purchased this calendar for a friend when she was pregnant and loved seeing how the baby developed and hearing her updates. Yes, I know that you can get the same information off of Baby Center now but the calendar allows you to write in updates as you go. It was so fun and something easy for my hubby to peak at as he was getting ready for work in the morning. Trying for baby #2 and will have one for him/her too."
2,Definitely wouldn't buy it again,"I ended up not even using this calendar. The drawings and information felt like it came from a textbook in 1970. It looked like something my mom would've used as a teenager. Besides that, it just came with some useful, but unnecessary stickers. Wouldn't buy it again."
3,It is useful if you are new to the language.,"I was disappointed that this book was not more extensive. However, I was looking to do more technical work and while it was inadequate for that, I did find it to be practical and a good book if you are new to Korean."
4,Playstation 2 Info Motherlode!,"At last, a Playstation 2 guide that's legible, understandable, entertaining, and above all useful! If you have a PS2 or know that you will be getting one, you need this book. The manual that comes with the PS2 is incomplete and virtually useless as far as the finer points of PS2 useage are concerned. Throw it away and replace it with this beautiful, timely tome. If game hardware manufacturers (and even game developers) would hire the author to write their manuals, the game world would be a much more understandable place for both newbies and hardcore gamers alike. Perhaps one day the reading materials provided with games and game hardware will actually be more entertaining than the games themselves. This is certainly a step in that direction."
1,Not what I expected,"Robe isn't very lush or thick. It is cotton and terry, but fades quickly in the wash and becomes less burgundy and more pinkish wine. I wouldn't recommend buying for a man unless he's ok with wearing pink.Some of the stitching isn't done right either, as there is fraying on the outside of some of the side seams. I've had it for less than 12 hours, and washed it once.It ends up looking rather cheap."
3,TEARS AND LOOSE THREADS,"There were conflicting reviews on this product but I gave it the benefit of the doubt. It arrived and I tried it on and the terry cloth felt comfortable. However, when I washed it the first time, strictly according to the the attached instructions, there were loose threads, the sash loop on the right was practically torn off, and there was a tear on the seam above the same sash loop. I would have preferred to return it but I couldn't figure out how, so I removed the sash loop on the right, sewed the tear above it, and hope nothing else comes off or tears when I launder it again. I probably wouldn't recommend it to anyone unless they're handy with a needle and thread and don't mind trimming loose threads after the robe is washed. By the way, how do you return this type of product and get your money back."
2,I wouldn't buy this and I love Aladdin brand bottles,"My trusty Aladdin bottle for many a year finally broke. I scoured the city looking for a replacement and ended up with this product. Skid proof bottom - great. Skid proof strip on the handle - even better. The thermos has improved, I figured. However, when I went to pour my first cup of coffee out of it - @#$* - coffee all over the work on my desk. What was Aladdin thinking - did they even test this product? It dribbles out of the bottle right down the side TERRIBLY! I ended up scanning the net for my older model (which apparently is a closeout now) and bought 4 of them to be sure I'd have a proven winner for many more years to come."
1,Non-Travel,If you are looking for easy pour on the go DONT buyThe stopper does NOT allow pouring without complete removal Plusthe top is cheesie.
1,Take a pass,This was to replace a previous Aladdin thermos I carred for many years and was damaged in car accident. This new one not built to last. Glass bottle broke at end of first week of use. I take coffee to work ea. morning. Had to return it and am still waiting for my credit for this purchase.John R.
2,About the volume and incapability to hold heat,"I saw, before I bought it, in the review that the design was bad and it was not easy to pour out without spilling. Actually it seems now this is not quite a problem. The two problems are that the effective volume seems much smaller than the claimed 32 ounce, and it can not keep heat well within 12 hours."
4,Good CD Player,"This CD player doesn't have any bells and whistles, but its cheap. I mean that in a good way. It has good sound, never skips, and has stood up to life in the gym bag for some time now. The headphones wear out really fast, but what do you expect. It doesn't do MP3 or anything like that, but if you just want to listen to your CDs, this is as good as you'll probably need."
1,Secrets of a Call Girl,"This was released a few years ago by Noshame films under the title, Secrets of a Call Girl. The film is somewhat boring, doesn't fit into a distinguishable genre, and isn't the best of Edwige Fenech's roles. Worth a rental if you're a die hard Fenech fan."
4,Great product for the price,"This is a great product! It prints very well and when you go to write on it the transfer is basically flawless. The only reason I would give it a 4 star is because you have to print each copy seperately. I would be better (probably more expensive too!) if you could just take both pages and print them all together. Other than that the shipment came much faster than I expected and the overal quality of the paper is great, I will definitely buy this again."
4,Keeps stuff secure and out of sight.,"It's a good thing I don't have a back seat for my Wrangler. This cargo box will not work with a back seat. It does keep your valuables out of sight, and pretty secure considering it's a hard plastic. It does what I bought it for, and I'm happy with it."
2,Well written but not effective,"I love Andrew's blog but I respectfully differ with his views on gay marriage. He fails to recognize that it isn't only Christians who oppose gay marriage and he fails to debunk the best idea for traditional marriage, linking kids to their parents."
3,FOR AND AGAINST SAME-SEX MARRIAGE,"Andrew Sullivan, editorSame-Sex Marriage:Pro and Con: A Reader(New York: Vintage/Random House, 1997) 373 pages(ISBN: 0-679-77637-0; paperback)(Library of Congress call number: HQ76.25.F677 1997)A large collection of previously-published short articles,presenting all possible arguments concerning same-sex marriage.The major themes: historical background--precedents for same-sex marriage;religious debates; court rulings; political perspectives--right & left;Defense of Marriage Act; affect on children;slippery slope leading to other changes in marriage law;why should gays want something that is not working for straights?A comprehensive collection--but without any break-thru ideas.This book will stand as a good recordof thinking about same-sex marriage up to 1997.If you would like to consider other books on same-sex marriage,search the Internet for the following bibliography:""SAME-SEX MARRIAGE--FIRST BOOKS""."
3,Review,"Interesting, independent, but with some repeated arguments from text to text. Very useful to help thinking about same sex marriage."
3,"Good, but not great","I bought this sander based on the reviews read here. I wasn't looking for a heavy duty sander, just something to sand down putty used to patch some holes in the walls before I painted. While the sander worked well, the velco did tear off after I removed the first sheet of sand paper (I, too, used super glue to stick it back on) but for me, the biggest issue is the dust collection bag. It collects a fair amount of the sander shavings, but once you remove it to dump it out, it is really difficult to put back on. I had to remove the backing (which is attached with screws) to get the bag back on tightly. This seems poorly designed and adds too much time to my projects."
4,Overall very good but there is a common problem.,"I have used this little sander for everything from wide panels to small, delicate boxes. The versatility is a strong point and I have put many of the attachments to use.The dust collection canister on the back falls off on a pretty regular basis and it really doesn't catch much of the dust in the first place. This is kind of incovenient but really isn't that big of a deal.HOWEVER, Given the fact that this sander is designed to be versatile, they really should have made the hook & loop (Velcro) base more durable. During the first couple paper changes, the panel that is on the sander started pulling away from the body. Even being careful not to tear at it the panel eventually came off. I have glued it back on about 3 times now and I think I may only be able to do that one or two more times before the material will be too far gone to fix. This is a design flaw that Skil should look into because it makes a great product less than ideal."
1,Octo Sander,"I received the sander on June 12. It had a defective part (the Velcro backing came off of a part of it). I called Skil. They said they would ship out a new part. I called today, June 28. They told me the part is backordered for yet another 10 days. I find this outrageous for a name branded item. Until the Velcro came off, the sander worked OK, other than the dust cannister which opened up several times."
3,homeowners sander,This is an ok unit to use for smaller jobs and tight corners . Not something to be used every day and all day . Use in small applications.
5,The best game for PS one!,"This game is great! There are meany levels, and alot to keep you busy. This is the best game in my collection! I gurentee you will love it!"
4,Great,"Rayman is a great game, really fun. It's colorful and the graphics are good. But man, man this game gets really, really HARD. Like, REALLY HARD! Sometimes it seems literally impossible! But, that doesn't take away from the fun like it does in some games. With careful playing, it is definitely beatable. You'll be missing out if you don't try this. -Trent Foreman, Author of Nightmare"
4,A challenge for young and old alike.,"Rayman is a great 2D platformer game from a visionary game designer. If you like games like Sonic, Mario, Megaman, or Ghouls and Ghosts, you'll like Rayman. It's simple controls lead to complex gameplay as fantastical monsters swarm around you as you run, swing, bounce , and fly your way through gorgeous levels. Once you defeat all the bosses and finish the game, you can go back to previous areas to collect all the items you might have missed. Rayman is a very fun game with good replay value and is definitely worth a try."
2,freezes in game,I can not get past level 2 as it freezes in the middle of the game and will not continue.
4,A magical little platformer,"Rayman's a total trip! Sure, the graphics aren't 3D, but the animation is beautiful! The gameplay is very good as well, with solid control and plenty of fun tasks such as finding captive energy bits and one-ups. If you're a fan of this sort of game, regardless of age, you'll love Rayman! Heck, it's four years old, and I'm STILL playing it!"
3,Good,this game was cute but you need to focus or else your will destroy the game. if you or your kid is about 4 or 5 this game is perfect but you can't save and when you run out of lives you have to restart from the beginning.
3,"Captivating, mind-bending, and addictive","Enter the challenging world of Rayman and suddenly reality seems far too tame. Free your mind as Rayman takes you on arduos adventure through a complex realm of psychedelic landscapes, absurd characters, fomidable opponents, and uncharted levels of dementia. This mind-altering platform game features...1. Menacing opponents that learn your playing style to defeat you2. Incredibly intense visuals with 65,000 colors and four independently scrolling backdrops3. 70 surrealistic levels4. Over 50 demented characters5. Exhilarating CD-quality sound effects and music"
1,This game is hard and it not that good.,"I thought this game looked like fun, I was wrong. It is frustrating and you have to press so many keys at once. They never tell you what key to press, and there is bad guys all over and if you get hit like once your dead. This game is dumb."
4,Unbelievable!,"""Wow"" is the only word to describe ""Blood Guts & Tears""! If you want to become a paramedic, firefighter, or SWAT team member, read this book first, to see if you have what it takes! It not only gives you cases, but the thoughts and emotions Brent Braunworth went through, which I think is great. It's a short book, but leaves a lasting impression. I recommend!"
3,It was okay,"This was entertaining, but a little too cynical for my taste. I have been an EMT for 3 years and have not experienced as much as he has, but it seems as if he needs a change of pace.Not a bad book, just not the best I have read on this subject."
5,"A Work of Art, equal to the best Grisman, Fleck, Thile .....","I was amazed. After hearing Simple Pleasures I went right back to Amazon to get some more Alison Brown and Twilight Motel I've found to be one of the finest recordings I own. This album showed me that Alison Brown is in the elite category of new acoustic musicians. On this album she's backed up by Duncan, Marshall and other giants. I think it's her best album. If you've heard 'Return to Pelican Bay' from her ""Out of The Blue"" cd then get this right away and have a listen to the original 'Pelican Bay'. After hearing 'Shoot the Dog' you'll know that she is every bit as masterful with a banjo as Fleck himself. I can't recommend this album highly enough I put it right up there with the best Grisman, or Fleck, or Thile."
3,"Okay, but not dynamite.","This is a nice enough album, but a bit sedate for my taste. It makes me want to press the button to go to the third floor. Or wherever. Much prefer her bluegrass-y style to pop-y style, try Fair Weather before this one."
2,Dense Text and Few Examples,"I'm a senior in Mechanical Engineering and I'm using this book for an elective I thought would be fun. I'm not some guy that is blaming poor test scores on a book, I'm genuinely disappointed by it.This text is one of the worst I've ever had to deal with. There are very few examples in the book and the solutions for the problems are nowhere to be found online. The lack of good examples can make a simple question take obscene amounts of time.The book is formatted poorly as well, which makes it difficult to find things when you're flipping back and forth between pages. There are a few pictures and graphs but most pages are just block text which can take quite a bit of time to wade through if you don't already know exactly where to look.Unfortunately most people buying this book don't have the option to choose something else, however, if you're a professor wanting to change books, I would recommend looking elsewhere."
4,Great Reference guide,"I think this book is an excellent reference for designers who constantly need typographic inspiration. The dingbat collections are excellent to use as graphics. The book does not actually contain the fonts, so don't buy it thinking you're going o get thousands of fonts."
4,Strong melodic metal,"At first I found Firewind to sound like a lot of other metal bands and was thinking of giving it 3 stars. But on the second and third listens I changed my opinion. There are some excellent riffs here and overall very good guitar playing. The solos are pretty standard from song to song but it's made up for by the band as a whole sounding so good together. Another reviewer's suggestion that the singer sounds like Klaus Meine from the Scorpions is dead on. I thought the vocals got a little buried in the mix and could have been brought forward more. It took a few times through the CD, but Firewind finally caught my attention with Hate World Hero, Brother's Keeper and Perished in Flames being favorites."
4,Still on the right path,"Gus G.continues to churn out quality music that show his roots to the past metal gods, while putting his own stamp on metal's future. Firewind continue to play clear,aggressive,melodic, heavy metal at all tempos. The CD features shred guitar sound with a singer who sings at a mid to high level pitch,while the songs feature good tempo changes along with strong melody. Top tracks for me are ""Tyranny"" which is a mid paced driver with a chorus that will make you put your fist in the air and sing along. ""Can't Escape from Tommorrow"" is a superb rocker that starts up tempo,then kicks into a higher gear for the chorus, which blisters. All in all this is top quality metal that should lead the way for metal to make it's comeback."
2,Generic trash,"So here it is, a firewind album. Why I give it two stars? Well maybe a certain creativity is missing. It may be spectacular in the late early 80's but definitley not now. I am giving this two stars because they had a cool album cover. But, if you like Hammerfall and all that talentless [...] then you'll love firewind."
4,Outstanding paranormal detective story,"This is a reissue of the long out of print second book in the series. I hope that this reissue does not mark the end of the series.Garrett is hired by a storm warden's secretary (the storm warden is a powerful sorceress) to advise her on ransoming the storm warden's son before she gets back from the war. But the whole thing seems rather fishy from the get go as you would normally hire someone like Garrett for the whole operation not just for some advice and appearances. This is where the plot gets involved and interesting with various bad guys trying to out smart each other. Good characters some humor and a very good plot overall. The one rough spot is what happens to the ransom. We are talking about a total of 8,000 lbs of gold here and that doesn't get moved fast or easily without a crew or magic.Overall an outstanding read though.BTW I notice that there are none of the editorial flaws that seem to be cropping up in books recently."
5,BETTER THAN ALL OTHER MOISTURIZERS!,"I just started using this cream two days ago and I am so impressed. My senior citizen (that's all I'm saying) skin looks hydrated, plumped up, and thicker. I've been wasting so much money on all types of expensive skin care over the years and none of them ever showed any difference; in fact, some of them really irritated my skin so I was getting desperate. I read about this Ponds cream on a beauty forum and decided to try it. Boy, what a wonderful surprise. Now I'm not saying it reduced wrinkles or sagging, but it sure did plump up my skin and it is glowing and my makeup goes on beautifully. Won't go back to any other skin care."
3,Newton was gay!: Deal with it!,"According to Derek Jarman's autobiography, Newton was what we'd call gay nowadays. This A&E special, instead, says something like, ""Well, Newton was so hooked on science that he didn't have the time for love."" Yet it stresses that Newton never married and had a nervous breakdown after his ""intimate friend"" left England. C'mon, be more daring! Gay scientists everywhere would have appreciated finding out the real deal about a potential role model. Biographers have ducked the issue with George Washington Carver and Maurice Ravel as well. Very disappointing!"
2,hard to follow,I read about thirty pages and really had a hard time following the point. I love reading great books about God and Jesus' Revelation and Prophecy. This just didn't do it for me. Maybe some people might follow the author better.
2,Our Turn to Dance,It was adequate. His words are hard to hear and understand. Writing his own songs is a plus in my book but his later albums show more polish and professionalish.
1,Unhappy,"I tried to order this on dvd, but screen was confusing, and I ended up with it on a view online program. I was unable to cancel the order. I know the movie is good, but amazon dropped the ball on this one. Be careful if you try to order a movie on amazon."
2,Good Book but NO DVD,I enjoyed this book and the cd that came along with it. However...there is NO DVD along with it as was advertised. I was disappointed by this and probably should have sent it back since it was advertised as coming with a cd and a dvd. I do recommend the book for Wilco lovers but get it at a store or from their website instead of on here.
4,"Lighten up, Francis","If this last guy wants to go off on Tweedy for being pretentious, then he shouldn't use the word ""didatic"" and then misspell ""heywire"" (it's spelled haywire, dude).I think the price of enjoying an artist that refuses to fit into a box is that he sometimes can seem a bit pretentious. Deal with it. If you can't then go back to you Nickelback CD's..."
4,It Works,"This thermometer gives a fast reading and seems to be accurate. The probe is small so it easily fits under the tongue. The electronics part is quite a bit heavier and sits out fromo the probe so there's a bit of a lever trying to pull down on the part outside of your mouth. So, I find that it's a bit difficult to keep it stationary while it takes the reading (I just hold it). It beeps when the temperature readiing is complete but I do find the beep to be too quiet so I have trouble hearing it. The thing is easy to clean since it it has a fully covered body (except for the probe tip but that seems fully bonded to the body); I would not suggest immersing the whole thing into water."
1,Chemical like taste...not so funny,"It has a funny chemical like taste possibly because of the soft rubber used, wonder how much of that chemical is going into the body!"
3,oral thermometer,"Readings of this oral thermometer seem to be quite accurate.The instrument did not ""beep"" when finished with the temperature reading."
3,Inconsistent,Not sure about the accuracy of its measurement. The temperature kept varying over different attempts within 10 minutes.
1,Terrible,"This product is terrible and 80% of the time, I will get different results from consecutive measure&reading(varies 2-3F!). I'd like to rate it as negative star if I could. Don't buy this!"
2,Unsure of the quality.,I bought two of the mf12s. I tried them both at the same time and there a two degree differance.
5,Dribbling to center stage!,"From the basketball court to the stage, Wayman Tisdale dazzles his audience with his musical talent. ""Power Forward"" is not just a position on the court, it is an amazing debut masterpiece that illuminates the Power that comes from the Creator of talents.Tisdale performs tributes to his Lord (""Amazing Grace), family (""Gina Kay"" and ""Gabrielle""), and sports fans (""After the Game""). These jazz tunes will entice listeners to get up from the stands to celebrate life and love!"
5,"wonderful man, great talent","Wayman Tisdale was multitalented man, taken before his time...his music is sweet, lovely jazz. We intend to add more of his titles to our collection"
5,The Gutter,Awesome book! We all need to reach into the gutter around us and as he says it's not always skidrow. To be like Jesus we will.
4,My Comfort zone isn't so comfortable,This book really challenged my comfortability. I couldn't stop myself from being convicted of my walk as a Christian and how good I really got it.
3,The Gutter,"This book is very good, and full of many excellent ideas and quotes. I often read with a highlighter in hand, and my copy is full of yellow. However, the amount of pushing the author gives to the idea of ""The Gutter"" gets a little old, and I found myself thinking ""Ok, I get the idea, you don't have to say it again.""I also found it difficult to pinpoint exactly what the author identified as ""The Gutter"" that he was talking about. In the beginning of the book he writes out a list of what the gutter is, and the explanations he gives all seem to be different from each other. Throughout the book, I was left asking ""Which gutter is he talking about now? The physical place? The spiritual? The emotional?""It is easier to be critical than to praise, so I will leave it at those few issues I have with the book. I would recommend it to others, but warn them to try not get too bored with the seemingly forced theme."
1,5 Ways to Soccer Speed Lacks Details,"I attended a training session at an AYSO (American Youth Soccer Organization) conference where the instructor presented some techniques for training and recommended Vern Gambetta as a resource for additional material. This book, actually more of a pamphlet, was available at the conference so I purchased it. When I decided to implement the program with my soccer team, I found that many of the suggested methods lacked illustrations or descriptions, and those that did exist were not all in the ""How-to"" index in the back of the book, but were in sidebars scattered throughout the text. If you like Gambetta's ideas I would suggest you NOT buy this pamphlet, but check out his 68 page, fully illustrated book titled ""Soccer Speed"". I have not reviewed it, but I wish I had known about it before I bought the condensed version: ""5 Ways to Improve Soccer Speed""."
1,One of the most boring animes in a LONG time,"The plot in this movie was exceptionally boring. It moved extremely slow, and kept me at the edge of my seat the whole time (literally, I was about to fall asleep and fall off my chair). I can not recomend this one to anyone"
4,Upgrade to latest software,"This is Alpine's first entry to the portable Nav system so naturally there are bugs in the system as with all new systems.Recently, I have updated the unit to Version 1.1 software which fixes quite a lot of the bugs that I have found. There are some system performance enhancement as well.""Traffic"" function is now possible with this latest software update. It comes with free 3 months of Navteq traffic subscription. I encouraged those folks who have problems should order this software update from Alpine website. It is available for free on DVD."
1,This thing is junk!!!!,"I just got back from Colorado. I thought this would be the perfect companion...helping me to navigate through the mountains with ease. After about two hours on the road, I became extremely impatient with the constant message: ""system re-routing"". The stupid thing tried to take me on roads that didn't exist, and wouldn't acknowledge well-established roads and highways that have been around for years. The sensor can't keep up with the vehicle. It constantly showed me off the side of the road, thus giving me the same old message...""system re-routing"". I can't wait till Monday so I can take it back. I'm going with Garmin or Lowrance!"
4,"Quick delivery, thanks","Great item. Quickly shipped. My husband loved it, and although the fabric mesh was a little harsher than I would personally like, my husband said he was fine with it. So, it's a really nice item, and a great gift to give a Bengal's fan. :-)"
5,I miss Michael Jackson,This product took a while to arrive but with MJ dying I figured everyone was trying to get it. My children love this cd and it makes me remember the good ole days with MJ
4,Loving the Jackson 5 and Reliving the Past,This is a nice compilation and a must have for anyone who enjoys the Jackson 5 and reliving precious moments from the past!
5,Young genius!!!!!!!,"I forgot how cute little Michael Jackson was.......until his death I had really paid little attention to what he was doing.except for his trial..........whatever he was in life.......he was a good ""Daddy"" and talented beyond words!!!!!!!!!! He truly was a great singer........I love his early days recordings ........who couldn't appreciate this little five year old singing his little butt off!!!!!!!!!!!! ""Momma"""
5,ALMOST perfect.,"Here's how to make this a perfect J5 collection. Replace ""It's Your Thing ('95 Extended Remix)"" with ""Ben"" (how could they forget to include Michael's first number one single?) and ""Goin' Back To Indiana"".Other than those two oversights, this collection is top notch. Awesome sound quality, great packaging."
4,Can It Get Any Better??,"The Jackson 5 will always remain my favorite artists of all time. This album contains all of the hits from Motown. There all here, ""I Want You Back,ABC,The Love You Save,I'll Be There,and so many many more. I grew up listening to songs and still love them today. An when the group disbanded, I did not being a fan. I am also a huge fan of Michael & Janet as well. Two of the greatest concert givers of all time. I wish I would of been old enough at the time to see the Jackson 5 live. Hopefully, they will do a reunion album and tour one of these days. I know Michael will be releasing an album later this year, so I am awaiting that. The only flaw I have with this album, is that it does not include the 1971 #1 hit ""Ben"". As for that, this is a perfect collection from the Jackson 5. I recommend this to you!"
4,Jackson 5,I was so sad that MJ had passed away. I wanted to have the music that so inspired millions of people and where it started.
5,Michael's Fan Forever,"This is the BEST COLLECTION OF SONGS EVER RECORDED. I love you Michael, I support you whole heartedly!"
1,Jackson 5 review,"I was very unhappy with this purchase. I bought it for a christmas present and it said it was guaranteed to be delivered by christmas eve. It was not there until about 3 days after christmas. If I knew it wouldn't be there for christmas i wouldn't have bought it. I called to complain and customer service said they could only refund me the 2 dollars for shipping. 2 dollars does not make up for not having someone's present on christmas.I will never ever buy presents for christmas through Amazon.com again, and I am telling everyone about what happened. That was unacceptable."
5,The Jackson 5 is the best ever!,"Yo they are so cool! They have such good voices and I love their songs! And Scott, if you're out there, I'm blaming you for getting me hooked on them."
5,timeless hits to enjoy,"i'm listening to 'maybe tomorrow' as i'm writing this. this is an excellent album showing michael's early hits with his brothers (and a few solo hits of his) it also has the r&b and pop listings of each of his songs. i think it's great michael was 11 when his very first single went to #1 (i want you back) anyone that likes michael's music, needs to get this as this is the start for the king of pop."
4,What Happend to the Jermaine Vocals,"I Want You Back is one of my favorite songs and Jermaine was my favorite Jackson. On this CD his vocals are missing from the song, major disapointment for me. But overall CD is excellent!"
5,Great,it was great it was great it was great it was geat it was great it was great it was great it was great it was great it was great it ws great it was great it was great it was great it was great it was great it was great it was great it was great it was great it was great it was great it was great
4,BLINDED BY BUBBLEGUM,"I was a white kid in the '70s in love with The Beatles, The Stones, The Doors, and suddenly ...Stop! Na, na, na, na, na, you'd better save me, na, na, na, na, na ...I want you back, ooh, ooh, baby, I want you back, yeah, yeah, yeah, ...Sit down girl, I think I love you, No! Get up girl, show me what you can do! ...shake me, shake me baby, ooh, ooh, shake me, shake me baby ... come on now! ...Got to be there, tooo beeee theeerrrre ...and oooohhhhh, I'll be there to comfort you ...I never canna sayya goodbye, na, na, na, ...na, na, na, ...na, na, na, .... This compilation brings back happy memories. I was a troubled child. My parents didn't know what to make of me when I came home with my first Afro. Dancin'! Dancin'! Dancin'!"
2,Kinda disappointed,I bought this for my 8yr old son who is an absolute MJ fanatic! Nice packaging and all but a couple of the CD's don't work...what's up with that!
1,Disappointment,I ordered the cds but never received them. they were returned to the company that I ordered them from. needless to say I am not happy as I was really looking forrward to getting this music. I ordered it around the second anniversary of mj's death.
5,"""The lucky ones got their brains blown out!""","Beyond mandatory, if you don't own this book and keep it next to your bed then you're not a true horror fan. Hardcover with over 300 artworks from some of the wildest horror/exploitation movies ever released. You name it and it's here...BLOOD VENGEANCE, DEATH SHOCK, SS EXPERIMENT CAMP, THE BEAST IN HEAT, CANNIBAL TERROR, THE BLUE EYES OF THE BROKEN DOLL, INVASION OF THE BLOOD FARMERS, SATAN WAR, KILLER NUN, WOMEN BEHIND BARS, SCHOOLGIRLS IN CHAINS, LOVE CAMP 7, MARDI GRAS MASSACRE the list goes on and on.Quit reading this review and just buy it. Maybe they'll come out with a part 2! Slasher fans also check out ""Legacy of Blood"", great book."
4,BatTat Activity Bus disappointment,"I saw this bus at a hospital waiting room and ordered it thru Amazon via Target. WE we very disappointed in the finish of this new product, there was incomplete paint, smudges and scuffs in some areas. No way to really file a complaint and don't want to return it after spending 2 hours putting it together over all very nice and kids went right to it, BUT for the price it should be near perfect when you recieve. Packaged well and in two boxes, so finish problems are from factory. Disappointed."
4,a lot of apples,"While the quality of this product is good, especially in hot cereal; the quantity is overwhelming. I do not think I will use them all in my lifetime. So, no, I would not recommend them, unless you have a very large family."
4,Skewed music,"Sometimes I listen to this CD when I need to unstick from the usual predictable patterns. Rodach creates a sonic landscape that unravels in unexpected ways. No Hollywood music here, thankfully."
4,Solid Case Album,Been a PC fan since '86. His first record had a huge impact on me as a musician. S.L.H. is definately one of his best. If you're a fan you've got to have it. Keep up the great work Peter!!-jp
2,Needs editing!,"I am a new radio station advisor and I bought this book to help with my transition. While Dr. McCluskey does offer some helpful information, the book is in sore need of an editor. I am only on chapter three and have already found several typographical errors. Material is repeated, the fonts keep shifting and sometimes the point Dr. McCluskey is trying to make is unclear. The poor quality of the book's presentation makes me question its credibility. I would suggest looking elsewhere for material regarding advising, managing and operating a student radio station."
2,700 Club,In 1981 cocaine grossed $35 billion and marijuana $24 billion. The federal debt exceeds $1 trllion. A tithe is 10 percent of your income. God created man in his image.
4,Review from a 12 year old gamer,"Rayman was okay. If you like games that are like Super Mario Bros., then this is for you. The graphics are great, but the music could be better. The whole point of the game is to free your friends from your arch-nemisis. But the only way that you can free them all is if you get this key in the first level and trade keys with a friend. Sure I've beaten the game, but not with the key."
4,old school songs,Some of the songs had some static but most of them came in clearly.Overall the quality of the sound was very good.
4,Pretty much complete,"There are only a few hits missing from this package but it beats the rest of the so called ""greatest hits"" by the Temps"
3,"3 *'s FOR THE CD, 5 *'S FOR THE TEMPTS","Did someone over at Motown have a brainfart or something. Why are these Motown tracks being ""remastered"" in MONO? The entire first disc of this 2 disc set is in mono. I have the old Compact Command Performances CD which includes 8 of these tracks and on that CD they're all STEREO. What's the deal?Can't fault the music. One of the greatest acts to come out of Motown, or anywhere else for that matter."
4,Guitar slinger extraordinaire!,"This is the first Nuno Mindelis CD that I have purchased, and its a good one. Nuno's guitar playing burns throughout the entire CD, ranging from clean and fast on certain tracks like ""Hugs"" to overdriven and moody on others like his cover of Hendrix's ""Castles Made of Sand"". The fact that he uses Double Trouble as his backing band helps to lend that ""Texas feel"" to the CD. I also find it interesting that according to the CD liner notes he uses a Gibson Les Paul, because there are definetly moments when he echoes SRV. If there's any drawback to this album its his weak vocals, but I really don't think that anyone buys a Nuno Mindelis CD for his vocal prowess. Nuno is an innovative and exciting guitarist and this album certainly serves to justify that."
3,"The text needed an editor, but how about those pictures","Richard Ellis likes writing about the oceans. He's quite good at it. Unfortunately, Deep Atlantic reads like a cross between a series of magazine articles and a wildlife guide. It's interesting in its own way, but the book is hamstrung by poor editing. The topics are organized into chapters, true, but there's very little attempt to link the chapters into a coherent whole. Too many chapters degenerate into a dull listing of creatures: ""and then there's this squid, which is like that other squid, but different from the next squid..."" I'd give the text two stars at best. The book is saved by the wonderful drawings - over 100 - also done by Mr. Ellis. In fact, Deep Atlantic probably would have been better as a coffee-table book, with large drawings accompanied by bite-sized bits of prose describing the weird and wonderful creatures of the deep. But who'd buy a coffee-table book about sea cucumbers and creepy fanged fish? Apart from me, that is..."
4,cover to cover for a non-fiction book,"I would truly love to meet Richard Ellis, the author of this book. He has produced a very eclectic bibliography on life in the sea. I understand that he began his career as an artist and all of his books are beautifully illustrated. This one in particular makes liberal use of scratchboard art which does a fine job of bringing the creatures of the abyss to life. The first section deals with the history of deep ocean exploration. I found it particularly interesting. Proceeding sections deal with the myriad of ocean geology and biology topics. Ellis' treatment of these subjects is effective, particularly for the person with interest but a less than advanced background in science. I don't think you will find all the information here in another single source. Ellis, if not a marine scientist, shows a mastery of research and bringing his topic together. Some of the information is a bit disjointed but all in all a very good read."
2,"lovely, but...","I got a chance to see Mary Azarian's new alphabet book yesterday. I think her illustrations are heartwarming and lovely, and have enjoyed them for years in the Cook's Garden catalog and in books like The Plain Reader. I'm also a gardener and a former children's librarian ,and I enjoy seeing gardening depicted in children's books. However, I must say I was sadly disapponted to see no people of color depicted in any of the illustrations in this book. Surely Ms. Azarian must have met a nonwhite gardener at some point in her life; if not, that's sad, and she is welcome to come to my house and meet me before the next book. As a person of color I felt saddened and left out as I looked through the pages; how would a small child (of any ethnicity) feel? Had it not been for this exclusion I would have joyfully given this book five stars."
4,Beautiful graphics but limited,"This software was put together beautifully. The graphics are top notch as is the audio. My 3 year old enjoyed this software for the 8-10 times he played it. It would have been nice to have different levels that the kids could progress to instead of the same game and the same 3 trains in the car wash and other games over and over again. This software is fun and it is part of our library so that we can pull it out every few weeks. I would have preferred something that held his interest for a longer period of time. A nice touch is the ability to print out pictures of the trains either in color or black and white for your kids to color. This part continues to be a hit. Despite my reservations regarding different levels, I still recommend this software."
5,Great package of westerns,All 4 of these movies are worth the time of any fan of westerns. Each different in its own way but all are well above average.
4,Range better than expected,"I use these headphones with my XM radio that needs to be hooked up to an antenna. The range of these headphones is better than expected. I can hear fine anywhere on my acre of properety. They would get five stars if it were not for the background hiss noise. Mostly I listen to sports and sports talk, so the hiss doesn't bother me."
3,Its OK but read me first,"First I have to say I have ten thumbs IM 63 and technology is a puzzle BUT.. Someone should tell you not all TV'S come with headphone plugs. So after I hooked it up I found out that audio out goes to an amplifier not to a headphone. So after crying to my wife I went to Radio Shack and found they sell something called a headphone amplifier for $30.00. This converts your audio out to headphones. The amazing thing is it worked. Now there are batteries in the phones and in the amplifier. But I must say it works. Two things, the claim that this will work at 300ft must be in an open field, by the time I got to the kitchen the sound was nothing but a soft hiss (only 40 FT). Two, no matter how I adjust fine tune there is always a soft hiss sound. If your like me you will be annoyed. On the good side, my wife and I are taking again as I'm deaf, and she has bionic ears. Peace in the bedroom once more. You can buy much better, I think!"
2,short circuit,"One side of the earphones short in and out, you have to hit it to get it come come back in. The sound and reception is great when both sides are working. Maybe I just got a dud? Seems liek a nice product if it worked correctly. Wouldn't buy again though, the distributer said refer to manufactures garuntee, what a hassle."
4,Wireless Headphones save boys!,"I bought another set for my sons that said you could hook it to VCR or TV, etc. IT would NOT work so I started looking for some others. My husband was tired of the teenage sons keeping him up at night watching late night TV and movies. These headphones have saved the day and NIGHT!The boys are very happy and so is my husband. I would have given them 5 stars but I (old lady that I am, could not get them hooked up right) but my sons had NO problems. It is really neat in that there is a charging unit that keeps the batteries all charged up and the boys can use them for extended periods without recharging!"
5,Good for the money.,I just got the head set today. I usually listen to talk radio and tested it on a talk channel from my XM Radio. It worked well at a distance of more than 100' from the house. Turning your head at this distance causes it to loose the signal a bit but this happens with my FM head set as well. It can also send the same signal to my Advent portable wireless speaker without a problem. That's a plus for me. Charging on the cradle is touchy. I have to rock the head set to get it in the right position to charge. I like the Advent speaker and the AW721. I may purchase another headset for my son to use. I like it. The AW721 was a good buy at under $50.
4,Acoustic Research AW721 900 MHz Wireless Stereo Headphones,"I received this item as a birthday gift recently. I installed the components a day after arrival and immediately watched a couple NCAA basketball tournament games on television with comfort. A few adjustments prevented static noise. Overall, this is a good item for the price."
2,Really bad fit.,"I can't comment on the sound cause I didn't listen. I'm returning them cause they don't fit my head. (My head is not unusually small as far as I know.) The headband is NOT adjustable -- unforgivable for headphones in this price range. There's not even a basic click-click adjustment that one finds in the cheapest $2 headphones. There is an ""automatic"" tension band, but this works very poorly, and the headphones end up hanging very loosely on my head. My plan was to use these while walking on the treadmill, but I think they'd slide off pretty darn fast. If you have a normal or small head and plan to move around a lot with these, you might want to think twice..."
5,Best deal for the money,Excellent product. I am very pleased with its performance. Wireless headphones is the way to go. Reception is great and it has quite a surprisingly long range of reception. These are great for listening to DVDs or music CDs without bothering anyone.
3,"Good, not the best","We use on our elliptical to listen to TV while we exercise. We had to return the first pair after 4 months. Amazon hit a homerun with their customer service, and I had a 2d pair w/in days. The tuning is a little annoying and the fit is just a little off.Overall, decent, probably worth about $40-$45 (what we paid for them about a year ago on Amazon)."
4,Good Wireless Headphones,This is the second set of wireless headphones that I have tried within the last year and they are the best by far. The transmitter base is so easy to connect to a headphone jack or component connections on a tv or reciever. Also using the rechargeable batteries are much better than always buying new ones. The only reason I gave 4 stars is that when I use the DVD player or any other platform connected to my TV the phones accept a small amount of interference but not enough for me to stop using them. Best wireless headphones that I have purchased and at a great price.
2,"Good sound, not so good quality","I've loved these headphones for the year or two I've had them. I still love them now.... when they work. The problem is that the cord is shoddy. When I plug into my laptop I have a hard time keeping it working. I have to twist the cord just right to get the sound to work. If its not just right I'll get sound in only one ear, if at all. I don't think this happened because of any handling issues seeing as how the base just sits on my desk. I don't think it has ever left my office and I don't tend to put items on top of the wire that might crush it. Overall I like these things, but I'm just getting sick of the sound phasing in and out when my laptop moves the slightest bit."
3,FUZZ...It drives me Crazy!,"Not a big fan of these. It is my first pair of wireless headphones, but for what they say they can do and what they're actually like are two different things. Constant fuzz and static and is especially annoying during quiet times on a movie or song. I've tried everything they say to fix the problem and it's no help. But if you can stand fuzz like a walkie-talkie, go ahead and buy them. Or maybe all my neihbors have them or several 900 MHz devices that interfere. I don't know."
2,Headphones-Poor Quality,I bought them for my father to listen to the TV. They were very fuzzy and had an echo. I sold them to a friend at a discount and my dad is using his $5 corded headphones.
3,An ok kind of headphone,Strengths:Good Sound quality Consumes less battery Strenght in headphone designs very less prone to break transmission unit is very light to carryWeaknesses:Operates in radion frequency sometimes get distrubance from other radio transmission transmission unit is very light but bigger in size Color of headphone and trasmission unit does not matchSummary:The design of adapter for charging which fits into headphone is not proper. Sometimes it does not fit properly when you simply keep it on the charging unit. You need to make sure that it fits properly otherwise you headphone unit does not get charged.You need to logically make out which side should be kept where after some initial failures to charge.They could have made simple markings for left and right to avoid confusion.Not much technical problems but the better out design could have made it much better
3,Headphones sound good.,"The 'phones work well and sound good. I don't really care for how they had to be tuned in by dial, but once set, I haven't had to mess with them. They also don't fit snugly in the base, so it's hard to make sure they are charging."
4,Quite good for the price,"Pros: Good overall sound quality and volume. Light weight. Use AAA-format batteries (comes with rechargable li-ion). Easy to place on charging stand. Easy tuning to transmitter. Reasonably priced. On-off switch on headphones. Surprisingly comfortable for long periods. Pretty good line-of-sight range. Transmitter power control. Around-the-ear foam cups block most external sounds from user (and headphone sounds from others).Cons: Non-adjustable headband (auto-adjust strap mostly works). Some static when you move around. Picks up older (CRT) TV whine if transmitter is close to TV. 900 MHz phones and NEXTEL cell phones interfere with signal. Bass is somewhat boomy and treble is flat, but adequate for TV, most music--needs to be equalized for classical, piano. Slight whooshing noise (compander?) after transition from loud to soft passages. Works poorly when moving behind walls, but OK when still."
4,Honest Eb,"I like these. They have good sound for the price. The only negative to me are the cups. They are not deep enough and too slick. I tried the AR 771's at best buy, they are much more comfortable. I am going to buy a set of those next."
2,Did not work Well for me!!!,I am not sure why this product has so many stars for it. There is so much static in it that I hate it. Its hardly audible. Please find a better product.
5,"For the Price, HARD to beat!!!","I purchased these headphones for use with a television.First, they (the headphones) come with straight forward instructions (e.g., anyone can follow them and they do not have a million errors in them that lead the reader to wonder if English was not the author's first language). While headphone hookup isn't difficult - the fact that the instructions are ""sound"" makes it a bit more believable that the manufaturer really does care about quality and detail.Second - the headphone's performance is great! They are a bit bulky - but comfy, so no real detraction on that score.If one takes into account both the price and the quality of these headphones...I think they would have to agree - the product deserves somewhere between 4 and 5 stars."
4,Works good.,"I got these for our church fpor a couple of people with hearing problems. They work OK, but they are sensitive and hard to adjust the volume."
2,Hissing and interference,"This product, being wireless, is subject to interference. I thought that it would be incidental and avoidable, given that there are 3 different channels available to switch to on the unit. Unfortunately, all three channels had static in my house. It might be due to the fact that the base unit is next to other electronics, but honestly, use adjacent to a DVD player, cable box, and gaming console should not be unexpected. Either the product is very poor or the user is an idiot. I'm not that stupid and couldn't locate anything in the instructions shipped with the product to help solve this problem.I recommend a different wireless headphone product or, more my more simple 2nd attempt, normal headphones and a cord extension."
1,"Never Worked, Would not hold charge","I bought this for a gift for my husband and it never worked. Tried to contact seller for exchange but never recieved communication back. Recieved orders to Iraq so it seemed to much of a hastle to deal with them. Cheap, just sucked up the loss. Will get a name brand next time."
1,fugghedabouit,"The headphones are heavy, you have to be an engineer to set up the system EACH time you use them. In short, definetly NOT for me. Save your money. One of the few items I purchased from Amazon in which I was not satisfied."
4,Priced right for the quality,"Some reviewers have indicated inability to get the hiss out. The instructions need read before using. There is a tuning adjustment not common to other headphones that needs adjusting. I was frustrated at first, but getting the adjustment correct took the hiss out. This adjustment is a good feature as fine tuned the range is better than my Sony. The quality is not as good as my Sony wireless headphones but is quite good for the price. Now my wife can listen wireless to her TV programming while I listen to my XMradio. Quality for her TV listening is not needed so she gets the ARs. I like the quality of the Sony but the feel of the ARs. Always trade-offs. I would have given a 5-star rating if the quality was as good as the Sony, but for the price it probably deserves a 5."
2,Just OK - I was disappointed,These headphones are not the best I've ever used. I am disappointed with the quality of the sound. They are difficult to tune in so there is no static. I would suggest trying out wireless headphones at a local outlet before ordering online. They are a little heavy on the head and not very comfortable. This is not a reflection on the vendor ... just the product.
2,Aw 721 wireless hardphone,"I have had this item for approx 3 weeks, I bought it online and tried to return it but had no luck. The unit shorts and only plays on 1 side and needs to be played with to make it work. Also the unit note self adjusting, which means the owner has to adjust it constantly.I would not buy this unit again and am search for a unit to run with on a treadmill."
1,support services not supportive,"This product was not compatible with my father's television at the nursing home. Acoustic Research support services offered no solutions. Only blamed the tv manufacturer, though the tv was fine. Did not appear to care about the customer at all."
1,don't buy it!! its a waste of money!,"the wireless connection is pretty bad, the sounds is not so great, probably cause of the wiresless connection. most of all, it is not comfortable at all."
4,chapter one,"thought I could help with some things. In the military you can recieve a court martial for V.D.. tHEREFORE HAve a good excuse. Got it from a toilet seat. The I.D.. A friend who is a clerk at H.Q. COULd have obtained a DD FORM ll73 and filled it out for OSwald. Falsified destroying one form that had been mistyped. A good clerk can sign his C.O.'S name as well as he can. Also Sgt Stout was probably fictitious. Probably what the clerk called his NCOIC BEHInd his back. The lamination on the ID CARDs at that time was very bad. You could take a card apart, erase a number on the birth date and suddenly you were old enough to drink at any bar. Trust me I've been there."
1,Ray La Fountain is no Don De Lillo,Ray La Fountain obviously feels inspired by Don De Lillo's excellant novel LIBRA but he is not up to the heights of De Lillo's masterpiece. I think there should be more emphasis on Oswald's character. A book like this should make you feel like you know Oswald but it does not accomplish this task at all.
1,What ever happen to Ray and Jane?,"I would to know what ver happen to Ray and Jane LaFontaine. Seem like Geral Posner is done very well for himself as author of many fine nonfiction but what ever happen to Ray and Jane they seem to just vanish. In Dallas last November I ask many people ""what tehy think of LaFontaine theory"" and they laufgh at me."
1,too many loose ends,"this has some interesting things but it leaves many loose ends,like it does not say who is on the grassy knoll,it does not say who impersonifies lho in many locations,it does not say about what he did in japan or ussr or mexico(important) it doesn not say about maurice bishop or clay bertram or radio control or u/2 or umbrella man or nagel or mr hunt or marita lorez. nor body alteration or autospy or x rays or single bullets or anything really.how many guns??does not say.did they getaway pilot???do not know."
1,Tripe,I've read a lot of JFK assassination books over the years beginning with RUSH TO JUDGMENT. This book was by far the worst. This book proves the old adage: Never judge a book by its cover. Save your money.
1,A Gross misaprehension of realty.,"The Authors of this book reflect a profound and unwarrented display of ignorance.The blather they write about their techniques of discovery of which they are so proud to pat themselves with, is confounding.Simply put, they are totally unaware of the Nation Security State which existed for years (OSS, CIA, DIA and Physops) and is stillwith us today!Finally, how surprised and perhaps dumbfounded they would be on learning that Lee Oswald on the day of the Assissination, received a phone call at TSDB - faciliated by the '3-Wheel' technique used by David Ferrie. (He did not make the call)."
1,Why did Oliver Stone praise this?,"I just saw Oliver Stone's outstanding ""JFK"" on brand new DVD and was all psyched for new evidence. The back cover of this book contains praise from Oliver Stone and says it is new evidence, so of course I wanted to read it. What a let down. How can Stone put so much work into this great film and then praise a jumbled mess of a book like this? I don't understand."
1,"""Stop me before I talk again!""","Usually when a book generates as much criticism as this one has, it's a sure sign that it's got something going for it.Usually."
2,"Interesting, but flawed...","Despite the apparent maddened horde out to discredit this book (some of whom appear to have not even read it), I found the book interesting, if flawed.As others have pointed out, the book is overly long, and does contain a lot of needless speculation (especially on Silvia Odio) and exposition.Nonetheless, it does offer an interesting take on such things as: the identities of the ""three tramps"", the links between Oswald and Ruby, Oswald's DOD ID card, the relationship between Oswald and the FBI, and Ruby's gunrunning activities.In short, it's worth a look if you have the time. Just skip the chapter on Silvia Odio..."
2,Bobby Bare dvd,Dvd had one song at low volume. tried it other players the same thing. Should have returned but haven't done so
3,"Nice Rattle, Not the Best Book","My son (now ten months old) has a good time shaking this book. As long as the little house-shaped plastic pieces don't get stuck in the plastic tube that holds them, visible through a cut-out on every page, it makes a nice, gentle rattling sound, and there is a handy cut-out for a handle.The words are not extremely exciting. Each page has a sound description (""A hammer goes tap, tap,"" for example), but the sounds are not connected in any way that I could figure out (hammer to keys to a person laughing...). This sequence ends with ""My book goes rattle, rattle.""It just doesn't hold my son's attention they way other sound books do (try ""Mice Squeak, We Speak"" by Tomie dePaola for animal sounds), but it does make an okay toy."
5,Excellent!!!,I shopped quite extensively for a descent pair of diamond stud earrings and these are the best deal/quality I could find. I searched local jewlers and a lot of online shops and Amazon came out on top. I am very happy with them. They are very shiny and have excellent color to them!
1,Looks good on pictures,"I bought this online and immediately sent it back. IT looks ugly, needs set up and screwing and overall nothing that makes a child be interested in it. I then bought the Disney's little einsteins car that has the handle and seating and all other fun songs and equipment that helps the child interact. don't bother with this toy"
2,Average quality at best. Nice color.,The blue is really nice but the quality of the sewing is marginal and it will not hold up long. Belt loops have already fallen off.
2,It's a nice book. . .,"Well done and photographed. But it's not a ""sewing"" book. I was looking for something with new sewing projects, but this was more a coffee table picture book. I'm not as much into embellishments."
5,Dori Sanders' Country Cooking,This is an excellent cookbook. Along with the splendid stories there are also wonderful easy to follow real homeade recipies. I have let my co-workers look at the book and both of them now want to purchase the book. Purchasing this book is an excellent choice.
5,A wonderful find,I stumbled upon this book in a small restaurant in Southern California. I'm not much of a cook. I bought this book because of the wonderful stories included with the recipes. It made me want to move to the country!
1,Painfully out-of-date,"Just got back from 2 weeks in Chile and while the book gives a good overview of what to see, the details are useless. Many of the accommodations listed no longer exist. Directions for catching rural buses to smaller towns were always wrong (wrong bus company, sometimes wrong bus terminal). While the book has a 2009 copyright, portions of it clearly have not been updated in many years."
1,Don't ever get this book,"I just got back from Chile and this book is worthless. Every place I went to on my trip and looked up something in this worthless (and heavy) book the hostel was closed, the restaurant didn't exist, or the Museum wasn't really free on Sunday as the book suggested. The maps were outdated, incorrect information, less than comprehensive are all reasons I am very disappointed in the purchase of this book.My advice to you: look for the publish date and then subtract a year to get the most current possible date anything in the book could reference. Don't don't don't be a sucker like me and count on this book while travelling."
3,Somewhat disappointing,"I was a little disappointed with this Chile Rough Guide. Unlike my previous experience with other Rough Guides(Japan and India), this book's seemed a little thin on info. For example, the section on Torres Del Paine's W-circuit discussed only hiking in one direction whereas Lonely Planet's included info on both directions. There were a lot of missing details like that, and yet the book still seem to weight a little more than the Lonely Planet Chile. It's not terrible, but if I had to choose over again, I would go with Lonely Planet."
3,"An average book, somewhat lacking in clarity.","First of all, I must admit that my major isn't related to economics, so I had little previous knowledge of economics when I began reading the book. I was simply looking for an introduction to microeconomics and sort of randomly bumped into this book. I found that the authors' exposition of various topics is not very clear and the explanations are sometimes lacking sufficient detail. More importantly, the order of presentation needs improvement; quite often I found myself going back and forth in the pages of the book, trying to understand what the authors want to say. If you are looking for an introductory textbook in microeconomics, you can probably find something much better (I might suggest one of Varian's books, depending on your mathematical background; I found ""IntermediateMicroeconomics"" quite good)."
5,Great Read,"Anasi is a writer first and a boxer second. None-the-less he is passionate about the sport and serious about his intent in learning the craft. Because he is a writer first, he provides insights and word-crafting that is not normally found in boxing literature. One either has boxers talking to writers that write about them, writers that never really boxed writing about boxing, or boxers that can't write trying to do so. This is not a book about training in boxing, but it is a book about the spirit of boxing and that it can grab you and hold you indefinitely. Anasi does a great job in providing first person insight into not only his dream's, but those of his stable-mates."
4,"An ""excellent Buy""","I thought that this book was very well written. It told a very entertaining story of the life of a boxer. I was able to visualize and feel everything he was going through, Good and Bad, through his words"
2,I HATE THIS STUPID BOOK,"I hate this book, all the figures it refers to are on a different page, so you have to be flipping to and fro while you're reading in order to see the figure they're talking about, only to find out you still don't understand. I wish someone would come up with a good Heat Transfer book for Chemical Engineers. There are many gramatical errors in this book, and on the problem sets, and one of the tables in the back lists values of Cp under a Cv label. Ugh. Many mistakes, mediocre figures. There should be more pictures of real-life heat exchangers so students can picture whatever the author is talking about. If I ever learn or pass this class, it'll be because of my excellent professor, not because of this black and blue book. I can't wait to soak it in gas and set it on FIRE."
3,The Good and the Bad,"The Good:- A nice amout of examples.- Whatever is explained is explained pretty well.- Friendly style of writing.The Bad:- No solution manual.- Some mistakes in the solved examples.The Worst:- There is no focus on the heat transfer sceince itself - the equations are ""dumped"" on you with no explanations/development or even some example experiments that were made to get to the equations. The focus is on application of the equations to engineering problems and methods of solving differential equations.The bottom line:This book will not give you an understanding of the heat transfer science, but the ability to solve heat transfer problems. If that's what you look for - this is your book. Otherwise, look for something else."
1,Just Awful,"This is an awful choice for an introduction to this material. The text doesn't go into detail on the sections, and the examples can be better. Errors in the text can screw you up to."
1,Looking for help in all the wrong places,"This book contains very little useful information for those of us expecting multiples or who have given birth to multiples. It focuses primarily on twins and the background of the frequency of twins, how twins are formed and the difference between fraternal and identical twins. The book gives no practical advice on maintaining a multiple pregnancy or how to overcome the difficulties of raising multiples."
2,Not as pictured,This is not what is pictured. It is an older version of a similar game and will not work on any of my computers.
4,Recomendation,This book covers the really weird stuff that can happen and has information that I could find nowhere else. When bad stuff happens on XP this is where I go for the answers. T.Gough
2,"Fun,but way too easy",This game is too easy.i thought it was going to be hard.if you want a challenging game buy spongebob squarepants the movie pc game
5,I Couldn't Stop Thinking of This Story . . .,"The Promise Remains is a book that will forever be on my heart. I enjoyed the characters so much that I nearly read all of the book in one sitting. I couldn't stop until I discovered if true love would finally win out in the end!Also, Thrasher's style truly amazed me. I found the book thoughtful and well-developed . . . and I've already passed it on to a few friends who also loved the story. But I have to say that passing it on was purely selfish, I needed others to share the story with. It's a tale I could't keep to myself!"
3,Unfortunate Anachronisms,"This is generally a good book about the Pythagorean Theorem. I was disappointed, however, that someone did not catch the gross anachronisms before publication. In the book young Pythagorus travels to Alexandria, Egypt. However, Pythagoras was born (as the book points out) around 569 BC. This predates Alexander the Great by more than 200 years. Of course Alexandria would not have existed before Alexander the Great. Also as Pythagoras' ship approaches Alexandria, you can see the great lighthouse, one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, in the background. The lighthouse wasn't built, however until around 271 BC - even after Alexander's death. I know it's just a fictional children's book, but come on. Our children deserve a little better research."
5,Pythagoras made easy!,This is probably the most enjoyable way I have come across to teach Pythagorean Theorem to my children. It's one of those special books which children will read without realising they are learning a mathematical concept. Highly recommended to teachers and parents grappling with this sometimes difficult topic!
4,good for all classes,"I bought this for my 7th and 8th grade classes and they totally enjoyed it. I wouldn't think so because it was a picture book, but they seem to love it when I read the book to them in an elementary teacher voice. And the explanation of the theorem is good as well and presented in a similar way that I would present it."
5,"Martin and Lewis shine in the ""Funniest"" movie ever made!","My sister and I both agree that ""Jumping Jacks"" is our favorite movie! I fell in love with Jerry Lewis and Dean Martin the first time I saw them on the screen! Jumping Jacks will keep you 'laughing out loud' from the moment it begins, to its ending credits! Watch it, and enjoy!"
5,Jumping Jacks,"My whole family loved it. I have two teenage boys who never heard of Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis, but they sure enjoyed this movie. Jerry Lewis is very funny and his antics kept them entertained right to the end. I would definately recomment this movie."
3,Nothing special,This replacement battery fits my Toshiba laptop as advertised but does not give it any extra life over the previous battery.
1,Never received it,"I ordered this battery from AntOnline but didn't get the correct one. I received a Toshiba battery, but the next lower model (a 6-cell battery). The battery I was sent is a $30 cheaper product. Was someone trying to pull a trick on me, or was there a legitimate mistake, I don't know. I returned it, got my refund, and am not willing to risk it again. Good luck out there!"
3,a little boring,"it's really not the most interesting version of Bible stories I've seen. There's no activity to it really unless the children are older and can respond to the questions that are written on each page. My girl is only 15 mos. old and she gets bored once we pass the window cutout pages. I wouldn't have bought it had I seen it in person. I was looking for one that I'd seen that was lift-the-flap, etc."
4,Very helpful 6 tape series,"Includes 6 VHS': PowerPoint 97, Access 97, Excel 97, Word 97, Outlook 97, and Windows 95.- These might not be the latest versions but they go through all the basics.- It's the teach yourself series. You can watch straight through to see what you still don't know, or you can watch it in segments and practice, before going onto the next chapter/section on each tape.-No more trial and error to figure things out.-For the price, this will save you lots of time since it gives loads of shortcuts.-It's presented in a clear and easy to understand format.Was very helpful."
5,"Informative, wonderful, and astounding","I was so amazed at how accurate this book is on describing my 12 yr old son. When a book is written from a parent of a special needs child, it means more for they know what it is like to cope and deal with a special needs child. My son was first dz with ADHD, then it was just Aspergers. I tried telling doctors that he has both for I read so much info on both ADHD and Aspergers. It was either one or the other to them. This book was amazing for I know I'm not alone. It's not easy to raise my son, but he's my world. So easy to read and understand. I felt as though this book was written for and about my son. Must have for every parent, family member, and friends of ADHD/Asperger child. This book will give you more insight and coping skills to deal with doctors, schools, and everyone who doesn't understand what it is like to live with an Aspie child. I recommended it to his teacher and counselor. Thanks so much for this book, wish it was published years ago."
5,Very thoughtful book!,"This book provides a very persuasive case of the links and similarities between ADHD and autistic spectrum disorders. While it has been known for a long time that people on the spectrum often have attentional problems, this book explores this phenomenon more extensively. Most noteworthy is the conclusion that a diagnosis of ADHD often gets in the way of a diagnosis of autism. This leads to an incomplete understanding of symptoms of autism, which are often misinterpreted, for example, as oppositional defiance. Further, many opportunities to treat autism are missed. Great job!"
4,Fantastic snapshot of Australia's best kept secret,"Paul Kelly has put out many fantastic recordings but this live CD has an appeal all it's own. Many of the older songs feature new arrangements and surprises. The intimate audience adds flavor to this performance and begs the question....""Why is Paul Kelly unknown?!?!"""
2,Glorified Beach Towels,"All this hype about special wicking design... just a beach towel fabric.Doesn't really look refined enough to hang in the home.To make matters worse, one has already started to fray, after only two washes."
5,Wonderful Resource,"For those who are interested in behavior or those struggling with a child with such special needs, this book is a wonderful resource and overview of attachment disorders. A must for anyone who is dealing with severe behavioral issues for it provides strategies, methods, and treatment for those individuals who struggle to overcome a very complex disorder."
1,Don't be deceived!,"Good playlist of 20 songs, including Guitar Man, Peter Gunn, Because They're Young, Shazam!, Rebel Rouser, Cannonball and 40 Miles of Bad Road. However, none of them are the original hits we knew and loved back in the sixties. Sure, some of the remakes are well done, but this was not what I expected. Amazon doesn't spell this out, so I thought I'd do it and save you some money and frustration."
4,"Sexy and high quality, but not made for walking.","These boots are not made for walking. Either that, or I'm just plain bad at walking in heels. My feet hurt after a while. They are very sexy though, and of beautiful red leather. The size runs true.Tip: Don't get these if you don't want to stand out."
5,A very fun read!,"We love rhyming stories, and Flamingos on the Roof is no exception. I read a great review about Calef Brown in Wondertime magazine and was not disappointed. Whereas Shel Silverstein is a bit gruesome and crude, Brown's poetry is simple yet creative, fun and silly, and all around great reading with your little one. My 18 mo old loves the iambic pentameter rhythm of the rhyming, and the illustrations are wacky and fun (think Rev Howard Finster naive art). I would love to see him create a longer story someday, as the short poems go by too fast. I'd recommend his books for all ages, little ones and adults."
5,Granddaughters Love it!,"Another one of Calef Brown's delightful books. Be sure to check out: ""Dragon, Robot, Gatorbunny: Pick one. Draw it. Make it funny"" and ""Hallowilloween: Nefarious Silliness from Calef Brown."" He is an incredible talent."
5,Catchy and Surreal Poems,"Brown's poems are musical, inventive and super snappy. The pictures are sharp and surreal. I read much of the book to a class of 5 and 6 year olds, and they loved it. Get your kids hooked on poetry early and remind them that poetry is music. Calef Brown is a good start for a life of poetry reading and musical appreciation."
5,Erica Asahan Review on HofD Wedge,"Erica Asahan wrote:Okay, how do you say de gorjuice in Latin!?! This shoes screamed HOTNESS!!! I did not buy it from here, but mind as well! I wear this and my legs are endless, comfort I would give it a 4.5 out five and the appearance is great!"
2,no volume control,I bought these specifically for the volume control (since it's difficult to adjust on the kindle fire). The volume control doesn't work at all... Not worth the shipping to send back though.
5,another great deal,"awesome recording but beside the point was a great deal and arrived in perfect condition, at great price. very pleased"
5,Pure Smoothness,"The voice of Marvin Gaye is one which is the essence of soul. Despite all the commercial publicity it has gotten, no thanks to those damn California Raisins, I feel his recording of ""Heard It Through the Grapevine"" is still one of the most beautifully soulful pieces of music ever sung. Listen and learn from this man whose life lasted all to briefly."
5,A wondeful jazz pianist/vocalist from the 30's...,"Ramona Davies(known just as Ramona) was a very good piano player, who often played in Paul Whiteman's band, she had a great and swinging' style, and could sing as ""hot"" as Edythe Wright, Helen Ward or any other band singer of the era. These sessions were lead by Ramona and feature The Dorsey Brothers, Joe Venuti, Eddie Land, and a list of jazz all-stars that could go on and on. These are all small group sessions and Ramona plays piano and sings while these hot musicians back her up. Essential jazz, definately worth exploring."
5,This cd is absolutely fantastic. I enjoy every song.,This is one of his best. I never tire of this album and listen to it often. I even listen to Ian's music when I am working out in my weight room. I have made tapes from his cd's and listen to them at work and on the road in my vehicle. Great album.
2,I just didnt care for it that much,I am a huge Ian Tyson fan and have been lucky enough to see him in Jackson Hole in the 90's. I just didnt care for this album that much.
1,Basic and disappointing,No new information. More of a story about her child and not much help. Very basic...could have gotten this help from an article. How disappointing.Do not buy...too many other good ADD/ADHD books on market by people with deeper insights
2,Editorial Reviews does not describe this book very well.,"The Book Description above uses the word ""arrangements"" of classic worship songs. If you are a musician, don't be mislead by this. The notation is nothing but a single staff with lines about 3/8 inch apart from each other and with noteheads so big that they print the letter names of the notes in big capital letters inside the notehead. The chords are overly elemental. This book would be good for someone with little or no knowledge of music...it could be good for musically inexperienced kids, but if you are looking for a keyboard arrangement, I wouldn't recommend it."
3,Big Disappointment!,"I thought Rayman 2 would be a great game, but I was wrong. I beat it in 2 days with little trouble! I would save my money and get the Playstation 2 version instead. It has a lot more levels and better graphics! The N64 version of Rayman 2 has more levels and is a lot more fun!"
5,Awesome Album!,"How good is it? It's great! I've purchased it twice it's so good! It is definetely a classic in my opinion! Besides the great covers of R Kelly and Earth Wind and Fire, it has some well written pieces like: ""This Time Around"", ""Better Days Ahead"" (the title track), and my personal favorite, ""Places in the Heart"" which has a smooth fine wine type of flow. It's amazing how good he is at such a young age! Most guys I've heard that are this good are 50+ years old. If you like smooth Jazz with a funky R&B flavor, you won't find a better album!"
4,His Best.,"I think this is his best CD. ""Better Days Ahead"" is completely smooth, not too much singing on here. His best melodies are played on the guitar. Preview the audio samples and you will hear how Norm played the lines sensitively, and with light touch. This is a tight band and crisp production. This is a very sensual CD. No cheap synth-sounds on here and No drum machine.I bought it used here at Amazon for $2.00 sealed CD. What's the problem?I don't want all the singers and R&B; commercial stuff, just give me the Guitar Jazz and ""Better Days Ahead"" doesn't disssapoint. BRAVO!"
2,Norman seems to be treading Water.......,"on this joint. Like his other efforts, he comes stormin into effect, with this time around. Apart from facts of love, this CD is kind of samey."
3,"Not one of his best, but still worth having .......","Norman's guitar is almost like a vocal, so adding vocals on some of the tracks here just messes up the sound. And when he scats with the guitar like George Benson, to me that's pretentious overkill.But when he's just classic Norman, as on tracks 1,2,4 and 5, there's no problem at all."
5,Top-shelf contemporary fiction,"I hadn't intended to comment on Park's masterful new fantasy novel, the first part of an intended trilogy, since everyone else here has expressed all that needs expressing, but A Princess of Roumania deserves nothing but effusive praise, and one more 5-star review isn't going to hurt.Publisher Tor has done a fine job with this novel, releasing it in a beautiful hardcover, with a beautiful piece of evocative artwork adorning the cover.But what counts is Park's elegant prose, striking imagery, and three-dimensional characters. This is traditional fantasy done right, shot through with a mature depiction of good and evil (really, who is purely good and evil?). Buy this book!"
3,"I wanted to love it, but just couldn't","I had read so many glowing reviews of this book, and it seemed like something that would be perfectly suited to me based on these reviews. I was sure that I would just love it. Perhaps my expectations were too high and perhaps if I had just stumbled upon it by accident my experience with it would be different. But, as it is, I just couldn't really get into the book. And I just don't understand the uber-hype that it's received. Park didn't manage to engage me on the level of the writing, the plot, or the characters-- all were okay, but a little dull. Frankly, I was a little bored. I wish this review could be more helpful-- if I could get a better sense of what went wrong here. But in the end it was just a failure to connect that I don't entirely know the source of."
2,Clunky,"Unusually for me, I was suckered in by the author blurbs on the front.This book is very difficult to read. All the thoughts are fragmented...dialogue, internal character thoughts, action, everything. It jumps around, never giving enough information to figure out what's really going on in a particular scene.If the prose was better, this book would be ok. The ideas aren't all that bad, it's just a friggin' slog to extract them from the weird prose. Too much work. Also, it is often unclear which character is speaking, which I suppose is another problem with the prose. And then there's the POV...it keeps jumping from character to character.I actually haven't finished the book...I'm on page 146...but I don't think I will, because I'm really struggling. And I have utterly no clue where the rave reviews on the cover came from. It's a very clunky and obscure book. Which is a pity, because if the author cleaned up their prose, it might have been a good book."
3,A well-written series that wanders too much,"(Review of the entire series). Mr. Park's writing is very, very good, and the series is very engaging, set in an original fantasy world (hats off for avoiding England for once). Despite the excellent writing skills and intriguing and thoughtful characters, the series ultimately wanders too much, and ends somewhat arbitrarily. They are all worth reading, and you should admire the writing along the way, but you'll end up closing the last book and wondering what it was all about."
1,Yawner,"I was very disappointed in this book. The characters were boring, the plot was trite, and the writing was colorless. I cringe to consider the sequel. I definitely did not read the same book that Ursula K. LeGuin reviewed - her blurb on the cover was more interesting than anything that occurred inside the book. The only bright note was the cover art [July 2006 paperback]."
1,i can't even look at it any more,"the first hint that this was all going to end badly should have been the early misuse of a dorothy parker poem. but alas, i found the book well written at first. specifically, i appreciated some of the character development. but halfway through i realised, 'well, it's great for a first novel' only to discover it wasn't a first novel, so there was no reason for the author to be trying so hard. by 2/3 of the way through i realised that it was only getting worse. and, well, the final 30 pages had me muttering and ranting out loud. magic without context, poor transitions and questionable use of vocabulary made this a very difficult read.my husband likes to remind me that i don't have to finish a book if i don't like it. but sadly, i do. and so i finished it. i will agree with the cover review that stated it was 'haunting' for i will likely be depressed about having read it for a while.nice use of pullman's daemons concept though. truely original. </sarcasm>"
3,Witness the power of the blurb,"Sweet Jeebus! Check out the blurbs on the dustjacket! Hollas from Lethem, Le Guin, Crowley, Kim Stanley Robinson, Karen Joy Fowler, Swanwick! The only genre chieftan who refrains from blurbing is Gaiman. I dunno how I feel about this book. The characters were well-drawn and tangible, and the story moved along nicely. But the prose is quite clunky in some places (and it's distracting-clunky, not beachread-clunky), and some of the narrative techniques don't serve the story very well. And yeah, there's definitely some similarities to a certain story by Phil Pullman. Also, the cover art is lame. They should've done something Olde Worlde, maybe a woodcutting or Allumination sorta thing--not the drab, purplish goth heroine thing they've got. Read it if you want, but wait for the paperback."
1,Not interesting; couldn't finish the book,"About two thirds in the book I gave up. The story line wasn't interesting enough, I couldn't connect to the characters in the book and the writing could have been better. Paul often uses a lot of words and complicated descriptions for rather simple parts of the story.What I also don't like: The ""hero"" of the book makes too many mistakes and is not so nice to the people trying to help her, but still manages to blunder through; mostly by luck and lots of helpers.The story-idea could have been nice, if it was handled by a different kind of writer."
5,A Great Product!!,"This product is works great, so much better than the paper pads, which I will never go back to! Thx for a great solution to an annoying problem."
5,Works well for cats as well,Purchased for my handicapped and semi-incontinent cat. The pads absorb urine and odor very well and hold up well to clawing and regular laundering.
2,Disappointed,"thought there were 2 in the pack, but only 1. Found whelping pads that are not only cheaper, but easier to clean. Had to try this product though."
5,Durable and leak proof,These are the best pads ever. The wash w/o getting damaged and dry super fast they are light weight. Perfect!
2,Puppy hasn't used it once yet,"I'm not sure if there's a trick to get your pup to use this or not, but our pup has not used this once and we've had it for about a month... One challenge is that our pup is already house-trained, but wanted him to be able to use the pad late nights or early mornings. I knew I was taking a bit of a chance since our pup is house trained already... I've tried many of the techniques suggested by others but to no avail. So perhaps lowered expectations are required for trained pups? Nevertheless, I will keep trying different ideas for a bit more."
2,pooch pad a bit too small,"This size should fit the accompanying pad holder and is the first time I've used this size, though I've used the pad holder with larger pooch pads for years. This size is skimpy and barely locks down and has a tendency to pull out and leave the pad holder bare in areas. I won't use this size again. The next sizes are really too big, but at least they stay down and cover the entire area. Just a bit larger and this small pad would work as it should for my purposes."
3,OK basic starter...,"The video was OK to watch and get started I guess, but if you have played around at all with your harmonica you probably are beyond this video. Not a lot in it to ""work on""."
2,Boiled in Oil,"The book makes several peculiar claims, among them that boiling in oil was a common punishment in Colonial America. I would like to have seen some evidence substantiating this assertion.Most of the pictures are nice.Buy it at the sale price or not at all."
5,Great Game!,"The Sylon Corporation was busy at work on an army of robot soldiers that would save thousands of lives in the event of a war. The XT7 Cyborg-Commando Fighting Machines were thought to be the ultimate battle warriors. But something goes terribly wrong with Sylon's mainframe. The robots are unleashed on an innocent and unsuspecting public, destroying everything in their path leaving only a trail of death and destruction. You are humanity's only hope as the best sharpshooter the world has ever seen. Armed with your Super NES Super Scope, it's your duty to single-handedly battle the Cyborgs and demolish the malfunctioning mainframe computer responsible for this disaster."
1,review of the lg chocolate phone,"i got this phone bc of its cool and sleek design. i dont really use it to play music, but i did put a micro sd card on it. you need the earphones in order to really listen to it, bc the speakers on it wont be that loud. the touch pad on it is cool, but it is too sensitive u have to adjust it. the only thing i dislike about it, and is prolly one of the major is THE BATTERY LIFE SUCKS!!!! i charge it at night, before bed, take it in the morning to school, and by 3pm when im done, already half of it is dead, this progresses to another quarter gone by 5pm and by 8pm your phone has turned off by itself, without u even using it!!!! its rediculous, i cant immagine how it is if u get a few unexpected phone calls before lunch. i suggest finding something that has a longer battery life!"
4,Good soap,Good for the little ones. No scent is also nice to have on hand. Skin feels soft after use.
4,Worked well enough,I have a Ford Escape and these were able to get the radio out with a minimal amount of trouble. You might have to try a few times but it should work.
1,DIN removal tool - weak,Bought this tool to remove stock radio from new 2010 Ranger...the tool bent before radio was released. Would not recommend this product...there may be others out there with more strength.
3,double din needs two,"if you have a double din stereo, you will need two of these as they use 4 pins. in my case it still didnt work out. I end up taking off the entire dashboard to remove the stereo. My car is a mazda tribute 2003 fyi."
2,No instructions,"This worked after I got instructions from someone who used one of these before. You have to push the two handles into the radio about an inch then squeeze the handles together to unlatch the radio, then pull out the radio."
3,Got the job done.,"I got these so I could remove my factory radio, the holes on the radio were a little more narrow than the tools were but, luckily, they were easy to bend into place. The bad? The tools are pretty easy to bend. I actually bent them inward a little trying to pull the old radio out. I didn't expect the highest of quality tools, just an annoyance. Good tools and like I said, they did the job."
4,Simple to use but be careful,I had a set of these before but lost them so I got another set. Not too much to it. Insert and pull radio. I would caution that when firmly inserted to slowly unwedge the rado from the frame if its stuck. I was probably a bit too agressive because the radio kept getting stuck on one side. I made a brick out of my radio (most of the buttons quit working). Hard to say if it was me or the radio was already on the way out. These could be pretty expensive in indirect cost since I bought a new radio due to the issue.
3,You can make these yourself,It's a good tool but you can get the same thing out of useing a peice of a wire cloths hanger. Just cut the cloths hanger into peices about 6 inches in length and bend them in half. BAM You got yourself some ford keys for free!!!
2,Flimsy,"This item is essentially very expensive bent wires. It is very over-priced. The ends of these ""tools"" are not notched in a way that would grab the radio's retainers. Fair price for this item is around $1.49. It bends very easily when you try to push them outwards to remove the radio. Took a long time to successfully get the damn radio out."
1,Defective,"Of the two nightlights, one arrived defective. The switch was not attached. So every night we just unplug it from the wall."
1,"Fine program, but do not upgrade to 5","It is a fine and very useful program, I do recommend it to everybody. However, stick to version 4. Although the current version 5 adds a few bells-and-whistles, unfortunately several bugs of the previous versions have remained unfixed + several new bugs have appeared. In spite of the previous years, customer support is also zero."
1,Waste of time and money,"Although it was extremely fast and easy to install, it was all downhill after that. All letters and numbers entered for my password and registration number at installation were turned into jibberish upon rebooting my PC to start the program. I couldn't access ANYTHING on the program, any of the help features on Enova's website, or any other web sites. As for the Telephone Support phone number, no one answered the phone and no one returned phone calls left on their voice mail, and no response was received from my e-mail. After digging around in my PC for about two hours, I found a back way to uninstall. What a nightmare!!!"
1,Kidproof computer program,"This program locked up 2 of my computers. It would not recognize my pass word. I have spend 3 days trying to get in touch with the company that produced it and have been unable to do so yet. It seems as though they are out of busness. I have tried e-mail,web sites,phone. I am now trying to get it off my computer."
2,"Disappointing, Inconsistent - what was the musical vision of this CD?","Pairing two great musicans together doesn't always make for good music. The cello solos are beautiful, but when Carlos enters the duet, I get the feeling he is really struggling to break free of the limitations of his instrument. I play native american flute-- unlike the cello each flute has a limited tonal range, and you can only play in one key at a time. It is a fantastic instrument, and Nakkai is the master. However Carlos' work on the duets really didn't fit very well and was disappointing-- it felt forced. I would stick with ""Sanctuary"" which is my favorite Nakkai CD. Unlike ""Voyagers"" it has a consistent, moody musical texture and vision. Also, what's up with ""Amazing Grace"" on this CD? This was off-the-charts cheesy and really didn't fit in with the other tracks on this CD."
3,A review of Pico Canyon Chronicles,"This short book offers a bit of local California history. The focus is around Newhall and Mentyville, California.The story is mostly about oilmen and their attempts to drill in this region of southern California. Three areas -- the Pioneer Oil Refinery, Mentyville, and an oil well -- are designated California State Historic Landmarks.Not the best written book, but still interesting for those who like to know about local history."
4,"Yes, Virginia, there is a sequel","Not only is there a sequel, there are TWO sequels, and make sure you have them both when you start reading. I didn't know it was a trilogy and got caught with a terrible cliffhanger-feeling at the end of the second book.By the way, I've heard the whole series is going to be reprinted, starting in 2003! This is great news for all of us who were having problems getting our hands on Book 3, The Whim of the Dragon. (Book 2, The Hidden Land, is much easier to find.)The book deals with the story of five children who, like those in the Narnia books, travel into a fantasy world. Unlike the Pevensies, though, these children think they know what's happening in this world, because they wrote the script in a game they play! I've never before seen an author play with the idea of entering into your own world like that. Highly recommended, for its enjoyable writing and for its novel ideas!"
5,very fun beat em up,"For people my age the Power Rangers were to be made fun of, but it didn't stop them for putting out great games for the super nintendo. You choose your ranger at the beginning of each stage, and battle your way through in typical beat em up fashion. I struggled on the later boss levels, which says more for my playing ability then the actual difficulty level. Great for a bit of nostalgia."
1,Wrong DVD format,"Looking forward to this DVD. Was I surprised when I put it in my DVD player, and it wouldn't play. Discovered it was PAL formatted for Europe, not NTSC formatted for USA. Called Amazon customer service and was told that the NTSC format was not available. So I am shipping the DVD back to Amazon for a refund."
5,Fantastic and Beautiful,"While one reviewer was upset this DVD would not play on US players, viewers need to know that PAL DVDs will typically play on most computer DVD players, as this does on mine. This is a beautifully produced documentary featuring stunning photography and competent historical scholarship. Anyone who has actually seen Neuschwanstein and the neighboring castle Hohenschwangau in Bavaria in person as I have should love this DVD. The setting is incredibly beautiful in its scenic qualities, and the castle itself might well be among the wonders of the world, drawing many thousands of tourists to visit it year round. It is one of the top tourist attractions of Germany. A certain sign of the excellent quality of this DVD is that one is left with a huge desire to see more after viewing it, and anyone like me will return to view it many times. I only wish I were lucky enough to live there year round!"
5,WOW! Where are my socks?,"It's hard to believe a band this good exists. I have pretty much searched the planet for the type of music these guys make and with the exception of finding some recordings I didn't have of CSN, The Eagles, Poco, etc. I couldn't find anything new until I saw these guys at The Sweetwater nightclub in Mill Valley, Ca. They knocked my socks off. Get this CD. You won't be sorry."
5,"Crosby Stills & Nash, but with a little extra !",The group Venice makes music like a nice painting. Like colors the musical moods can change subtly and elegant and the interaction between the voices and the instruments is great. David Crosby is a big fan of these guys and you should listen why he holds this opinion. I hope they will make a new album soon !
5,Too Good To Be True!,"Absolutely THE BEST album to come out this decade. Incredible talent and harmonies that seem as effortless as breathing. Venice has proven themselves to be one of the bands that will surely come up when someone says ""Hey, remember the 90's?"" Buy this! It's the only thing I'm giving as a Christmas gift this year. (And as I hear it, there will be a new CD to give out next year as well!)"
3,Very bubbly but didn't really glow,"We used this (probably 1/3 the bottle) in a hot tub and ended up with more bubbles than we knew what to do with - it was hilarious. :D So we ended up having fun with it anyway, despite being disappointed that the bubbles really had no noticeable glow. We had exposed the bottle to very bright light for several hours prior to using it, so don't know what else we should have done in that regard. Oh, well - it was still a fun experience."
2,Barely glows at all,"My daughters followed the instructions on the bottle and barely got any glow at all. The bottle itself glowed well, but the bubbles just barely glowed. I'm giving two stars instead of one because it works well as non-glowing bubble bath."
2,not a good glow...,"It only glows if you plan on using half the bottle after putting the bottle next to lights, even then the glow wasn't great."
3,OK,"THE BEATS AND THE LYRICS ON THIS CD ARE REALY NICE. HOWEVER I THINK IT WOULD BE BETTER IF ONLY THE VOCALIST WAS ON EVERY TRACK. THE STYLES OF THE RAPPERS WERE JUST NOT DOING IT FOR ME. THERE'S ONE TRACK,SO HIGH, IT STARTS REALLY GOOD BUT THEN THE 2ND VERSE, THE RAP, TO ME IT MESSED THE WHOLE THING UP. BUT KEEP DOING WHAT YOU DO CREW!"
5,I'm his wonder twin...,"Seems like lifetimes ago this book made me miss my bus I dog-eared it with much love. We run into each other once and a while and I can't wait to see him again. I have a lot of adventures to share, and I've been missing my friend :> This book is a tresure of mine, and I still bring it to readings to share my favorites. much love to BJ Ward from RinTheRed"
1,"some interesting stuff, I think","I read all three of Ward's books during a free hour I had coming from a friend's and waiting for a train. This book had a little bit of more interesting poetry, though I have to admit that he doesn't seem to have hios own voice in this but imitating a lot of other voices. It's a sham to say, really, because once he found a voice, it became farr less interesting...much like the Shakespeare poem in here. He's a waiter, and rpetty much has the typical moves you'd expect. Maybe Ward needed to copy other people's poetry for a while and found his voice when he was actually ready to."
1,the first book...but not the last,"This is a banal collection. Scattered, disorganized, lacking vision. He was able to tune his efforts in other books, but they never got better. I'm not sure why he keeps getting published, because I just didn't like this stuff very much."
5,Good way to start double bass,"For the most simple way to the complex one, it works. You must repeat each step till you make it the SAME way he is doing. Don't cheat, cause the results are going to be noticed when you play."
3,I Used To Buy These and I Didn't Become A Real Smoker Either!,I know that these days that cigarette shaped candy is deemed to be politically incorrect because they say that they just make kids want to smoke real cigarettes and that may be true for some kids who are easily influenced but I remember being a kid and walking to the candy store with my friends and buying Candy Cigarettes and they didn't make me want to smoke real cigarettes and I did not become a smoker and I must say that I'm surprised that they are still selling these things as I thought that they were banned. I went into a candy store and I was told by the cashier that the companies that made them had been forced to stop making and selling them but obviously he was wrong! These days I wouldn't advise buying these for kids but only for an nostalgic adult who you know liked these back when they were popular and aren't the type who will get offended by gum shaped like ciagrettes and will start whining about it!
1,Selling the nasty habit to kids?,"I am sorry to see that amazon.com is helping to sell candy cigarettes. Perhaps most are for use by adults, but inevitably they will get into kids' hands as well. If tobacco companies are not allowed to target kids in their advertising, how can it be okay to sell make-believe cigarettes?"
1,Candy Cigarettes,The cigarettes have no taste. Many people in the workplace go out for a smoke break. I bought the candycigarettes so the non-smokers could go out for a breakalso - the cigarettes have no taste at all.
1,"Did you say aliens""?","David Jacobs indicates that he does not want to talk about the ""REALITY"" of it all. Jacobs shows the UFO memory common factors but not the human life common factors. One first and foremost common factor is all of these individuals were hypnotized by David Jacobs. What other common factors did they have in their lives? Possibly subliminal messages to individuals from some outside source to get the person in Jacobs office in the first place and then maybe forcing some strange memories on these innocent human beings, transgressing their memories back in time so they think the alien abduction took place at say the age 12 etc. Dehumanizing is a Trick of Satin. I find this book unbelievable and dehumanizing with all of the UFO medical body probing. If there were aliens as intellectual and advanced as indicated it wouldn't take years of research and medical probing of masses of people by the aliens to take over the earth."
4,Good book,"I was looking a next book describing UFO abductions to read. And this did feed my hunger! It was great now I can read ""The Threat"" and be fascinated. It's the greatest. Karla Turner's books are also very good!"
3,Would be worth 5 stars if it retailed for less,"This is a beautiful, if unnecessarily oversized and pricey, package. It consists of a large reinforced cardboard box containing a softcover reprint of Batman #1, an abbreviated hardcover version of Les Daniels' Batman: The Complete History, and a great 9"" Mego-style Batman figure, with cloth outfit and the best head sculpt I've ever seen, recalling his first appearance in Detective Comics. The box lid opens like a book, and the arrangement of the items within is very nice, giving them maximum visibility. This great display, however, causes the box to be about twice the size of what it needs to be. And because of its large size, is it really necessary for it to be priced so high? While it looks impressive, this material is honestly not worth the retail price"
5,A Great and Informative Read,"This book offered a lot of new insights and information about the real-life reactions of people aboard the Titanic, written by one of the survivors. I cannot recommend it highly enough."
1,This book is a waste of money,"HiI recently purchased this book.It is an exact copy of the stuff available on the website(cic.ga).There is nothing extra in this book.I bought this book cos i thought that it will help me understand some finer points which might not be in the website.But the book turned out to be a photostat copy of the website.If a person who is applying to canada and has already read the website in great detail, then there is no point buying this book."
5,Plant Information,This book is very informative. I've been wanting to grow plants that require little care once established and I've found them in this valuable resource. I highly recommend it to florida homeowners and gardeners.
1,Can't believe the reviews were so good...,"This book is way too general, the picture quality is terrible, I have gotten more from magazines about Native Florida Plants. Dont get me wrong it names a lot of plants, but if you plan on landscaping you will be looking for other resources. Would not recommend..."
5,Stevie Ray Blues,"The thing that attracted me the most to this album, aside from the other amazing tracks, was the tribute jam to Stevie Ray Vaughan. I just recently learned that the two were quite good friends, and am amazed by the tribute. This album is awesome."
1,Wrong product information,purchased this as a gift and when it arrived it was only 1 DVD when it is listed as a 10 DVD
5,Ernest Ansermet: The True Genius of our Time,"After listening to this and others of Ansermet's recordings from Decca over the last few weeks...how amazed I am at his fidelity and clarity to the score. Yet, these recordings grab the listener's attention with the most remarkable visceral enjoyment as well. Ansermet is the great unsung genius of our time...a conductor as profoundly great as Adrian Boult, but more cosmopolitan in his outlook...this recording is worth every penny."
2,Ansermet out of tune,"These are highly intelligent interpretations, but the woodwind and brass in Ansermet's orchestra cannot play in tune to save their lives. Quite painful to listen to in some spots. Too bad!!"
4,You're Gonna Love It,The CD came quickly and it was in good condition. Would recommend provider to anyone.
1,for mature readers only,"The reviewer who spoke of the sexual encounter is quite correct. It is totally inappropriate for young readers and speaks of two characters who ""did it"" and then talks of ""blood on the ground and blood on her dress....[then] they ran into the temple and they did it again.""That is on pages 48 and 49 of the edition I checked out of the library.Whatever the literary merits of this book, and I have no doubt they are many, this book should not be placed in the children's section of the library. It is for mature readers only.Moreover, I must say that I think it is strange that the mother half of the author team (a mother and son team) would co-author a book with such a passage with her 12 year old son."
3,Howard Miller Pisces Wall Clock,"Solidly made and looks great with stainless appliances in kitchen. However, three out of three people in house have difficulty seeing the time in daytime and at night. During the day, if in any shadow, it's difficult seeing the hands against the silver background, and with lights on, reflections from both the glass and the silver background impede the view of the time."
4,Good quality book,The book I received is in very good quality. Also the book was delivered in a week.
5,The best book if you are taking HR,Literally this book saved my life while I was taking HR class. The book explains very clear and very throughly every concept
2,Old Edition,"This textbook is the 3rd edition, not the 4th (and latest) edition. My college course requires answers to questions that aren't in this edition of the textbook. Thankfully, I discovered this before a week had passed, so Amazon was happy to refund my purchase and removed the book from my Kindle. However, I'm still left with having to purchase the actual textbook. If you can get by with the 3rd edition of this textbook, fine... But this is not the latest edition, so proceed with caution."
1,Disappointed,I received the wrong book. I needed it for my class and when it arrived I got the international edition. No where in the description does it say that Amazon is selling the international edition. After so many purchase with Amazon this one was really a big disappointment.
1,Wrong Book,"First time after many purchases has the wrong item ever been sent. This is the INTERNATIONAL STUDENT EDITION ISBN:978-0070292895. It is approximately 200 less pages. I don't know what else is missing, but I guess it doesn't matter. I think the US version third edition proper ISBN is 978-0073381473. SO Amazon, you should change the book image and add explicitly that this is a INTERNATIONAL EDITION."
1,Disappointed.,"Ordered the book a week before classes started, and didn't get it for nearly a month! When I finally got it the book, it was the right edition but the warehouse was out of the USA edition, so they sent me the international edition which is slightly different in content... Cover clearly says ""Not for use in the United States"". First disappointing Amazon purchase."
1,HORRIBLE,"I bought these headphones because of all the good reviews posted on here. I'll be the first to say these headphones are HORRIBLE. As soon as I turned up the volume, the bass lines started cracking and became heavily distored.So don't believe the hype, these headphones suck. Stock IPOD headphones are probably 100x better!"
2,Not much information,"This video is about 15 minutes long, and after you take out the hype, you have about 10 minutes. While well presented, it lacks in content and there isn't much that you shouldn't already know from basic massage techniques. Save your money and buy something with more in-depth information about sensual massages."
4,Fun and more,"Butt Massage is fun and this video gives some good tips, when you are done with the butt, there is the other side of the woman.For that, I recommend,Orgasm at the First Touchand alsoDeliberate Orgasm Duet: Expanding Female Orgasm plus The Technique of Peaking and Extended Orgasm.to give a woman orgasms that is beyond what she imagined."
3,Pretty good Game,This is a fun game for the DS. The graphics aren't that great. The story line is about a little kid going to the city and he goes to a theme park and builds it. My kids liked it a lot.
5,Fabulously funny art book!,"This book is so great! I love this book, I love this author. The author, Bob Raczka, juxtaposes two completely different art works to create hilarious scenes. For example, there is a paint-by-numbers type of painting next to a painting of an artist standing and looking in the direction of the page with the paint-by-numbers, holding his paint palette. In another combination, there is a painting of a waterfall. Next to that, you will see a painting of a few men in a small canoe paddling straight towards the falls. I shared this book with a group of complaining and disenchanted fourth graders and it made every single one of them smile and laugh. Success."
4,great heater,I use this heater to supplement heat a room in my house where the heat in winter is lacking. It works great
4,heater iffy,"Haven't really had a chance to test the little heater in bone chilling weather, but from what I've experienced with it in moderate to cool temps I believe it will be questionable whether or not it will be sufficient for a 300 sq.ft. room. I'm using it in a 275 sq.ft. room. I guess it depends on how much warmth one demands."
3,Quality,"Not the best, but price is right.Would like to have parts list with unit.I had to replace whole unit because I couldn't get 1 part."
4,Revision: Changing Rating for the Batter,"My original rating was poor, But upon contacting the seller I received good customer service and very willing to work with me to correct a problem. Note if you live in California, check witht he City and County to see if this product is up to code. I have yet to receive the item so I can't really rate the product itself but the store is good."
3,Not everyone needs to write their memoir,"I have read a lot of books on Alcatraz and been there many times. This book has to be the most dull. Sure it explains what a day is like for a prison guard, but a book describing the daily life of a public librarian would have been just as engaging. I didn't really learn anything new or important about the prison or those who lived on it. And I sure did not learn anything about Gregory. Check out Creepy Karpis's book, ""On the Rock."" It's probably 50% lies, but it's at least a good read.One more thing, the pictures in this book are mostly reproductions of other officially released pictures. I already have all of them."
2,Beginner or High Handicap - YES: Low Handicap - NO,"I would recommend this book to beginning golfers and high handicap golfers. It serves as a decent primer on how to prepare your mind to play a round of golf. Unfortunately, it is only a primer, no advanced studies here. I would not recommend this book to players with Low Handicaps or serious students of the game. I purchased the book to learn something new regarding the art of visual imagery. Unfortunately, the discussion regarding visual imagery is small and is very, very, very basic. Also, the discussion regarding how to get in the zone is drivel. There are other books (see Larry Miller) that provide a more thorough investigation of the mental aspects of the game."
4,'Una vez más' es lo máximo,"We're using 'Una vez más' and 'Abriendp paso: gramática' (as well as copied pages from 'Abriendo paso: lectura' and 'Preparing for the AP exam') in my AP Spanish Language class. It's not like I really love this book but it's full of useful exercises and information. Of course, we're using it as a textbook in a course that it was expressly written for. I don't know if it's worth buying on your own, but it's very useful in class and, since it has the answers in the back, it's better for self-study/review than 'Abriendo paso.'"
3,Spanish textbook,"I should have looked at the later edition, as the book was not in very good shape. The seller indicated fair, and fair it was."
5,A Very Good Product,"I had used the third version of this product in high school in order get ready for Advanced Placement Exams, and I found it to be an incredible review of many of the Spanish grammar rules. I wanted a similar version of this product for a review for some collegiate examinations, and I found this version to be just as helpful (truthfully, there is very little difference between the 2nd and 3rd version of Una Vez Más). However, it should be known that this book for advanced Spanish students who are fine tuning their compositional and conversational skills; if you are just starting out in Spanish or if you only have a basic grasp of Spanish grammar, I would suggest that you find a different textbook."
4,Review,This book has a lot of practice exercises. Explanations for the various grammar topics are targeted to help you review exactly what you need to know.
2,Just okay so far....,"I was having two problems that I wanted to solve: Box elder bugs outdoors and centipedes in a basement. Although the book had titles or sections for these, it was so limited that I felt a bit let down. True, overall, you get the message that natural substances can be used. But, it seemed more like a collection of grandma's remedies. They may work, they may not. You really are left with a lot of trial and error. For my money, I'm not sure it's worth all that much. I'm being honest here. As you can guess, neither of my problems were solved."
2,No index,No index to locate critters you need information on. As a librarian I believe that all good references sources should have an accurate index to be useful. Do not recommend.
2,Salty!,"Be forewarned!I did not know this product would be so salty. I usually get the lower sodium type of Better N' Peanut Butter (not that it is low in salt, at 85 mg.) and was used to that. This one tastes like salt and little else to me."
3,Gag,"I'm thinking in a smoothie the taste and texture of this would be okay. For me, a sandwich of this is unbearable. Using half of the amount of low fat peanut butter on my sandwiches is preferable to this. Don't buy this product in bulk until you try it out."
1,Yuck!,"I'm always on the look out for low calorie/low point/healthy alternatives to foods that I like. However, this food was a big disappointment. It honestly tastes like nail polish. I saw a review saying that on another website and thought: how is that possible? How can anyone sell a product that tastes like nail polish? But IT DOES! I purchased this at a Super Target for around $4. I, unfortunately, had to throw it away. I think I'll stick to reduced fat or sugar free peanut butter."
1,WEIGHT GAIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"LOOKING TO GAIN WEIGHT? I wasn't. My favorite smoothie to order is the PB and Strawberry, but they use this product. After 2 smoothies 2x week for two weeks, that's what 4 cups total. My weight has gone up! I'm a size 4, 5'6, 119 lbs. I'm a fitness, health freak, so when my weight goes up, something is wrong! What is it, then? SOY. Anytime I have eaten soy, my tush, thighs, and hips grow rapidly. Soy is a phytoestrogen, a plant estrogen. Women, like me, will put on pounds (around the ovaries: hips, thighs, tush) when consumed. Clifbars are a no no for me, too. This 'magic' low-cal low-fat 'peanut butter' is half soy! I am taking my organic PB to the smoothie shop, so I can have the real deal. The fat in the peanut is good unsaturated fats, why would you want less? Also, a tip. If you would like to feel great, and lose weight fast, try eating according to blood type! I went from 132 to 119 in two weeks! Google it!Ciao!"
3,Not good for protein shakes!,"I give it 3 stars cuz it's good to snack on. Snacking the better'n peanut butter with veggies and bread is not bad at all if you're a peanut butter person. This butter can be use in a good diet plan if you eat it sparingly.Now, I DO NOT recommend this for protein shakes. I lift weights and run 6 times a week and drink 3 protein shakes a day. You cannot taste the better'n peanut butter in a blended shake. I thought I could replace Skippy's reduced peanut butter, but I am back on it."
4,Maybe not better but...,"I read about this product and decided to try it. I paid a visit to my local Whole Foods market & bought a jar for less than $6. I was quite excited to find one of my favourite 'trigger' foods for half the calories, fat & sugar. I started to buy 3 jars but thought I should try it first. I rushed the jar home and tasted it on a spoon. Nice peanut taste but it is VERY sweet! Shocking considering the low grams of sugar. I could never eat it with honey or jam. I thought about cutting it with natural peanut butter but that would defeat the purpose of having a low calorie option. I eat it spread on Wasa multi-grain Crisp Bread. Very nice. It relieves my peanut butter craving quite nicely. I'll be buying the other 2 jars later this week!"
4,J P Beaumont is wonderful.,"J.A. Jance is one of thee most exciting, adventurous, mysterious writer. I absolutely cannot stand to put the book down."
5,J.A. JANCE GREAT WRITER,I have read many j.a.jance books and have always been very satisfied with her writing. And reading the first J.P.BEAUMONT book helped clear up questions about the series.
1,Pleased I Read This First,"A bumbling, gullible detective is picked up by a mysterious, beautiful woman during the investigation of a child's murder, and fails to ask himself the simplest of questions about her background, motivations or involvement in the case. The only mystery here is how he remains a police detective after such a performance. You may well feel, as I did, gratitude for the special offer that enables you to read this Kindle book for only $0.99 and thus save yourself from spending real money on any other books in the series."
2,Ho Hum,If you are desparate for something non-serious to read this is fine - but it's not going to make a best seller list
4,captivating,This held my interest throughout!! Read it quite quickly. Looking forward to reading future books by this author! Highly recommend it!
4,Good Read,I really liked this book. Was a good read. I like books that read fast and you cannot find out who really did it. This was one of those.
3,Not for me,I believe this writer has become predictable. There was a heaviness and laggardly process to the story. I will stick with reading the book descriptions before I buy from this author again.
5,jwo2012,"I loved this book, I recently started ready J.A. Jance and I love how she keeps you interested with every turn of the page."
2,Jance books,Until proven guilty was an excellent book as are all Jance novels. They are all well written and you can't wait to read another.My only complaint is you don't have Jance books on your daily deals. I love to readbut can't afford all of her books. Kindle is so convenient for me as I am homebound most of the time.Please consider more Janace novels for daily deals or at least 3.99 or less catagory.
4,Pivotal novel,"As a previous reviewer said, this book helps you understand J.P. Beaumont's circumstances in later episodes. I had started with some of the later mysteries in the series and wondered how he met Anne Corley and what had happened between them. In a book store I browsed through several paperbacks to find the one that introduced Anne Corley. (It's hard to browse through books on amazon.com although sometimes the reviews help out!) The situation, child abuse and murder, is grim, but the writing is stylish. (Although I felt the sex scenes were uninspiring). I like the way the author develops relationships between Beau and his detective partners or others on the force. These seem more natural than the romantic attractions."
5,J.A. Jance has another winner...,Can't wait for each new J.A. Jance to come out...so well written and you feel like you're living it...thanks for so much enjoyment.
5,Hard to put down,"I very much enjoyed this book. The characters (all of them) are rich with strengths and weaknesses. Just the right blend. I hate the characters who character flaws end up being more important to the story than the story itself. There is not a lot of action in this JA Jance book, however she holds true to her plot and you are not expecting the end. Enjoy, I did!"
3,No More Liver & Noodle Casserole Please!!!!,"""Church Chuckles"" is an amusing collection of cartoons about church life and the people in it. When you read it, you will undoubtedly find one or two cartoons which perfectly describes you or someone in chruch that you know. You will end up doing exactly what the title says: chuckling.This amusing little book is great to have and read on a day when you are down. The cartoons are not offensive and will bring a smile to your face."
2,Not that great,relationship of solar panel to rock-face surface makes it look like a sloppy solar device. The rock material surrounding the outer edges of the solar cell is about 1/2 inch. doesn't look like a rock when you see that...might as well use a nice looking projector type than a crummy looking rock
2,This Is A Good Remix CD!!,"I like this two song CD, but I was aware when I bought it that it was not remixed & that it was the original recording. I later bought the original recording & it is nothing like this remix. The original Big Boy recording is very simple. (drums, bass, guitar, & vocals) This CD has added drums & strings to sound more Motown. All J5 fans should have this CD, but it is not the original recording. :)"
1,Leave this alone!,"I heard this in 1995 with the eager anticipation of hearing the very first J-5 record. Boy, was I disappointed! Mike's original vocals are present, but are buried with heavy remastering and synthesizers. YECCHHH!! What a ripoff! Fortuantely, since then a plethora of recordings (mostly European bootlegs) have surfaced featuring the true early recordings of the J-5 in their original form. Buy ""Pre-History"" or some of the others and save this for your next frisbee game."
3,Not quite what I expected,"I bought this game hoping to relive all of those hours spent standing in an arcade without having to worry about converting my allowance into quarters. What I got was not quite that good.This software seems to suffer from the same problems that I've encountered in other ""historic"" PC games. They run too fast on a modern PC. I installed this package on an 300MHz machine (hardly state-of-the-art hardware) and, especially in the case of Centipede, the game pieces are too fast to hit -- even on the first level.I also found it troublesome that the size of the playing area is limited. I have a 21"" monitor and am forced to play the game in one small window.I do, however, have to say that while it has its problems, this is the best release of the classic games I've seen so far. The Pong game is great!"
5,Blast From the Past!,"If you loved these original arcade games you'll love this CD! I wasn't sure after buying it if it would be as authentic as the arcade experience I remembered as a pre-teen but it was! Complete with the original sound effects, images, and ""insert coin for 1 or 2 players"" on the monitor as in the original games. It works with either a controll pad or mouse (or keyboard) but I think the mouse gives superior performance over the controll pad in maneuvering around in games like ""Tempest"" and ""Missle Command"". I had no problems installing or playing it on my 500 MHz 56 K modem (Win 98). The graphics are to be expected considering their original look. Another great thing is that there in no 100 page instruction booklet before you can play. You just jump right in and start bringing back those memories!"
1,ALL CRACKED UP,IT IS TOO BAD THIS COMPANY PRODUCES THE ONLY RV OUTLETS MADE. TOTAL GARBAGE. THEY ARE ALL CRACKED AND SCRATCHED...RIGHT OUT OF THE BOX. US Hardware has ZERO CUSTOMER SERVICE. They will refuse to even help you with factory damage. CAVEAT EMPTOR!
5,Romance for the non Romance Reader,"It's funny how some books bring to mind other books, even though they are at first glance dissimilar. Christopher had enough going on in addition to the romance to keep me turning pages, but when I had finished reading what really struck me was the lingering sense of emotion.It put me in mind of Persuasion by Jane Austen, with that same aching agony for the characters. Quite an achievement for a first novel.I picked up the book on the recommendation of a friend, and was not dissapointed. I could count on one hand how many romance novels I have read, but I will certainly make a point to buy any future works by Ms. Chesney."
1,Best Buy from Germany,"I was lucky enough to be in Germany when they had just released Chartmix 7, I bought it there for like half the price it is here in the states. I on the other hand mainly listen to cd1 cause I really enjoy most of the mixes on here. Upbeat music, great mixes..helps me pick out actual songs that i want to get the full length version of. I would definately recommend it."
3,Not original artists,"Only CD2 is nice...I seldom listen to CD1 because it's not my type of music, sort of heavy techno, too much mixes losing the song's good tune. I was disappointed because songs were not original artists. At any rate, I like listening to CD2."
3,"Sometimes interesting, but often puts me to sleep","The characters in this book and their stories are interesting at times, but the author takes far too much time imparting their stories. I am reading this book for a church cirle book review, and I am having trouble reading it. If I want a nap that day, all I need to do is pick up this book and read it a while!"
2,Long boring read,"More a compilation of facts, dates and footnotes than an engaging non-fiction event into which these facts could have been woven. Hard to keep someone's interest, unless you're just compiling data say as a history major. Hummm... maybe that was intent."
2,Mrs. Lincoln and Mrs. Keckley,"I was disappointed in the viewpoint of the author who seemed less interested in the relationship of the two women than in the social problems of a free Black woman who was the confidant of Mary Lincoln. I began reading the book in an attempt to understand both women and the circumstances in which their friendship occurred. The book, however, leans heavily toward Mrs. Keckley & portrays Mrs. Lincoln at her best as a spoiled White woman & at her worst as a lunatic. The final paragraph sums up the author's reasons for writing the book in a complaint that Mary is buried in the Lincoln vault with President Lincoln (where else would she have been put?)& Mrs. Keckley's unclaimed body lies in an unmarked grave...""like those of her mother, slave father and son"". The book is not about Mary Lincoln or Mrs. Keckley; it is a social commentary."
5,True Friendship Has No Color,"I am FINALLY FINISHED reading MRS. LINCOLN AND MRS KECKLY by Jennifer Fleischner. What a book about the separate lives of Mary Todd Lincoln and Elizabeth (Lizzy) Hobbs Keckly (Keckley) who became unexpected friends during the Civil War and Lincoln administration years and ended up falling out after the publication of Keckly's BEHIND THE SCENES memoir which made Mary Lincoln look assed out as a presidential widow who had to pay off mounting debts by selling her clothes and other items in New York. Good stuff! I just could not get into Elizabeth's personality despite her contributions to African-American and American histories which have not been discussed on a wide level until the LINCOLN biopic. Jennifer Fleischner did a brilliant job giving the reader social, cultural, and political backdrops in telling the different yet common stories of Mary and Elizabeth. The book made me realize how true friendship has NO color!"
2,Riddled with errors,"The commentary does not mesh with the videos or photos. Repeatedly they will be talking about one type of equipment or a person, but the film or picture will be something else entirely. For example, while talking about large shipments of Sherman tanks arriving, they show film of M3 Stuart Light Tanks, when talking about Hurricane IIB ground attack fighters, they are showing P 40s and Spitfires, when talking about several squadrons of B25 Mitchells arriving, they show B-17s, when talking about the use by the Germans of captured Russian 76.2 MM field guns, they have film of German 150mm and 210 mm artillery, when talking about General Alexander arriving to take over, the first picture is of General Horrocks, when talking about the US M2 105 Howitzer being delivered, the film is of early war US 150 mm Howitzers. And so on ad nauseum all through the whole thing, pathetic."
2,Mediocre at best,"I can't believe all of the great reviews this book got. Having previously read Stewart's ""Hurricane"" and ""Scorpion,"" I was expecting a good read. Instead, I gave up after 50 pages. The book (what I read of it) seemed more like a first draft than a finished product. I thought Writing 101 covered the fact that ""alright"" is not a word (""all right"" is), and seeing it on page after page irritated me. Also, the writer's used ""chaise lounge"" instead of the correct ""chaise longue."" The writing style seemed mediocre--not in the league of James Patterson, Robert Crais, Lee Child, and Jeffery Deaver, whose thrillers and mysteries I love. Thumbing on through the book, I found a couple of sex scenes, which were okay, but I wonder if they were added to spice up a rather dull story. I'm being generous in giving it two stars."
1,the worst,Unreal that anybody liked this drivel. Absolutely the worst book i have ever read. Nothing good to say about it..can i give it no stars? What a waste of money.
1,Not worth your time,"No plot, no character development and manages to be boring even with all the ""shocking revelations."" In a word - lame."
2,obviously a man's fantasy,"I have no problem with sex in a book, but this was really a man-fantasy story, and the sex made me uncomfortable...especially between sisters, with nobody thinking its a bad thing. Also, nobody acted sad at all over the death of the sister/daughter. I just thought in general everything everyone did was so unbelievable as to be distracting."
1,I agree with the author--this should not have been published!,"Wow---where to begin. I read the book because it appeared on so many of my ""listmania"" suggestions that I thought I must be missing something great. I was wrong. Although laced with much over the top sex---what disturbed me most was the childish writing and lack of character developoment. I have never left a review for a book before, but felt compelled to give other readers a heads-up on this poor choice.How ironic that when deciding to leave my first review I noticed that the author left one just hours ago stating that the book will be discontinued because it is garbage. In many ways this redeemed him in my eyes...perhaps I WILL try another book by this author."
1,Couldn't finish it!,"I thought this book would be a great summer thriller based on the reviews. I couldn't finish it. I gave it a chance until about the sixth chapter, then I gave up. I knew I would think that it was a huge waste of time if I had actually finished it. It seemed like it was written by a sixth grader - short sentences, stupid, clipped dialogue. Glad I didn't spend a lot for this one. Don't waste your time."
1,I guess it doesn't take talent to get a book published,"This is the worst book I've ever read in my entire life. I belong to a book club with 6 members. None of us enjoyed Tangerine Dream. Which in and of itself is rare, because we all have different reading preferences. Personally I didn't think it was very well written. It certainly lacked depth. The characters were either extremely shallow or one dimensional.Incest, perversion and a weak plot. This book left most of us totally disgusted."
2,Mystery solved,"After reading TANGERINE DREAM, I came back to Amazon to review all of the rave reviews that had interested me in purchasing the book. I was thoroughly puzzled. The writing is just barely professional or skilled. the plot...implausible. And then I found the answer. The good reviews are not authentic. I'm wondering why amazon does not remove them, especially the one that uses the author's name as the contributor when it is so obvious that it is not by him."
1,Wish I could give it NO stars,"I like my books with...well...a feasible plot to begin with. And that just for starters. I like books where there is a character that is not only realistic but likable. I like books that have a plot, and books that seem like an editor actually read it. But, most of all, I like books that aren't...HORRIBLE. This is probably the worst book I've ever read. It's insultingly mindless, boring, packed with foreshadowing that is so obvious you'll be rolling your eyes more than reading the book. Save your money...unless you are a huge fan of the B-movie genre of course. For the rest of you, DO NOT DO NOT DO NOT believe the other ratings as I did and waste your money. There are so many great books out there, and this is NOT NOT NOT NOT NOT of them. It's TERRIBLE!"
1,Tangerine Dream,"I was very disappointed in the quality of the writing. The plot is weak. The authors try to use foreshadowing and do not pull it off. That may be part of the problem - two authors who don't write as one. The whole story is sadly not worth the read. Save your money. Read the authors' note at the back of the book if you are thinking of buying it. I am sending my copy back to the publisher with a note,it is that bad. I would have given a zero if it was an option."
3,Pretty but a pain to keep clean,I liked the look of the dish drain but it is a pain to keep clean I have to wipe the bottom off everytime I empty it or it will start to rust.
5,Reliable and 3 Mail Boxes which is good for many users in the same house,"Since I bought this one, it has worked very well. We, three of us, share three mailboxes when our friends leave messages to us. Great organization! Importantly, with 2.4 mhz, the signal is clear all over the house, even the downstair."
4,Book Review: Beadwork Creates Beaded Beads,"I recommend this book to both ""newbie"" and experienced beaders! Ms. Campbell has done an excellent job assembling a variety of beaded bead projects. The projects are fun and the directions are straightforward. Some of the projects could use more illustrations, but overall, this is an excellent book for getting started! I am also pleased with how quickly Amazon.com delivered my order!"
4,"NOT FOR A BEGINER, Still a NICE book 3 & 1/2 Stars","The Color throughout the book is inspiring But as I have found with other books by Jean Campell is that she seems to take it for granted anyone who picks up her book is already an experenced beader. I had to put her books away till I DO become someone who can do as she expects. I do not get her magazine for this reason. No clear instructions for a ""dummy"" like me.If you do know your beadwork and can follow instructions easily then you will like this book. She does have a chapter of instructions But What I find helpful is pictures of actual hands doing the work ""step by step"" There are a few magazines that do this and I catch on much faster."
2,frustrated beader,"I tried to make one of the beads, but the instructions were completely inadequate, so I was pretty frustrated after my first attempt. In the list of materials it said you needed seed beads in five colors and only colors A, B and C were mentioned. There were no bead patterns added, so after a few hours I gave up."
3,Beadwork creates Beaded Beads,"I have a similar book, and only found one of the patterns of interest to me, however, someone who doesn't have a book on this subject might like it. I sent it back, since it duplicated a lot of things in my other book, and I felt it cost a lot considering the few projects it had."
3,For Experienced Beaders,"Nice pictures and interesting designs but this is for the more advanced beader. As a beginner, I've found most of the instructions impossible to follow."
2,Low on laughs and riddled with cliches,"""I Could Never Be Your Woman"" is proof that a top notch cast and good director can result in an uneven and disappointing film. It is no wonder if went straight to video. Michelle Pfeiffer plays a divorced mother and writer-producer of a cheesy teen TV show (featuring diva-like Stacy Dash who did not look like a teen when she was in ""Clueless"" 14 years earlier) who takes up with a younger man who is guest starring on her show. There is no chemistry, and Pfeiffer married to Jon Lovitz (and subsequently dumped by him) is just totally unbelievable. Add to that the annoying inclusion of Mother Nature (played by Tracy Ullman) was just annoying and cheesy. Two stars for this drivel is generous!"
3,"NO FAST TIMES OR CLUELESS, BUT STILL BETTER THAN AVERAGE! 3 1/2 STARS!","Slightly disappointing, but still fairly entertaining romantic comedy with an excellent cast, 'I Could Never Be Your Woman' just doesn't measure up to Heckerling's best work. The social commentary laced throughout is when this film is at its best and the predictable and familiar story are when it is at its worst, but Paul Rudd and company are pretty easy to watch in just about anything."
2,No need to waste time on this movie!,"I found it very boring and with a poor script. It is sad to say because I do like Michelle Pfeiffer and Paul Rudd very much and they were the reason for me picking up this movie in the first place. But it felt like they themselves couldn't believe in the story - so how could they then convince me? It is love at first sight, at least for him. She plays hard to get and he is the eager young man that never gives up and endures everything for the love of his life - even though he is so much younger than her. It all appears so very unrealistic to me. No one seems to behave as grown-ups in this movie, although the daughter seems to be most reasonable of them all. All in all - not worth seeing."
3,Adequate at best,"The idea wasn't bad--Paul Rudd dating an older Michelle Pfeiffer. The result was mediocrity. For all the acting talent on this movie, it wasn't anything special. I just didn't like most of the characters and the ending was lame (a cheap shot at George Bush on a ""talent"" show). The only redeeming feature was Tracey Ullman. I rented this for a dollar; it was barely worth that."
3,PAUL IS AMAZING,"Mr. Rudd is amazing - he steals the show. The spectacular Dance sequence, and his intro sequence are worth the cost of the DVD. The story fails because he is supposed to be 29 (he is closer to 40) and she is supposed to be 40 (but she's really closer to 55). The Chemistry between them does not work (unlike Object of My affection with Jennifer). The story line about the secretary has been told a thousand times before - so it does not work with any credibility. Nevertheless Paul Rudd is amazing - and I trust that his star will continue to shine. the scenes of his screen tests (look at the bags under his eyes, make him dress in the same colour so that he looks thin) are hilarioius and remind me of the Judy Garland makeup sessions in A STAR IS BORN. Paul is a STAR!!"
1,Never,"There's a reason this movie went straight to DVD.They lost me at the beginning with that nonsensical rant by Tracey Ullman as Mother Nature/sometimes conscience/figment of Michelle Pfeiffer's character.I found this movie to be pretentious and overbearing throughout and was very surprised to learn that it was supposed to be a romantic comedy. I could find neither romance nor comedy. This movie tried way too hard to be clever, coming across as simply annoying instead. The premise alone was stale and overused: she's too old and he's too immature, they'd make a great couple. In what alternate universe!?Couldn't wait for it to grind to a halt. For a 97 minute movie it felt like 4 hours.Not a keeper and don't want to inflict it on anyone else."
2,Unbelievable plot,"I should have known this movie was a stinker when I realized it went straight-to-video. Here are the main problems: Michelle Pfeiffer as a GORGEOUS, over 40 but youthful successful TV writer/producer cannot find a date? Her ex-husband is Jon Lovitz? COME ON! Paul Rudd playing 29? Sure he has ""boyish good looks"" but at almost 39 its a little hard to believe he is 29 passing as a 16 year old on a TV show. I hate to say this but it would have been better cast with someone like Ashton Kutcher who is 29/30-The whole Tracey Ullman as Mother Nature thing was annoying and distracting. I couldn't tell if she was walking along side Michelle Pfeiffer or super-imposed- and she looked yellow.The only good thing I can say about this movie was Pfeiffer's character's daughter Izzie, played by Saoirse Ronan (who is nominated for an Oscar for her role in this year ""Atonement""). She gave a great performance.All in all, a big disappointment for Rudd and Pfeiffer fans..."
1,If only it were possible to give zero stars,What a dreadful piece of dross. Poorly written/directed/lit/acted and everything else. The excruciating post-Sex and the City smart-aleckery was just plain not funny.And the usually watchable Rudd was the most irritating suitor since that Scottish bloke in Sliding Doors.How does stuff like this get green-lit? What were they thinking?Rom-com Hell!
1,we need minus points for some movies,"this is certainly one of them.it was hopeless: stale, cheesy, dull and boring.not worth the time.I'm a fan of Michelle Pfeiffer, but goodness what a lame role she has here as an older woman and she didn't do too great really.And for the script: who wants to stay forever young and end up in the league of plastic fantastic?Michelle looked absolutely ridiculous wearing miniskirts. People (men and women) who are 40+ should stop dressing like teens.Makes them look pathetic.there are far better and interesting movies with a young guy older woman connection. I highly reccommend ""White Palace"" with Susan Sarandon, even ""Rebound"" is better than this stupid flick.The better parts of the movie are with Tracey Ullman as Mother Nature."
1,Extremely Biased,"Karsh's work is reasonably well-written, and comprehensive enough that it theoretically could serve as an introduction for someone interested in learning about the Palestine War of 1948. However, though presented under the guise of objective history, it is unabashedly biased in favor of Israel (something that emerges in the author's other writings, as well). Additionally, sources are NEVER footnoted, and indeed reference to other works is limited to a very slim ""Further Reading"" list presented at the back of the book. It is noteworthy that most of the work cited in this list belongs to the 1960s and 1970s (thus ignoring the work of such ISRAELI authors as Avi Shlaim or Martin Van Creveld - both of whom are less biased than Karsh), the notable exception being Karsh's own work."
4,Great follow up,"This CD is a great follow up to his first. This isn't a clone of the original, he has taken his game up a notch and has created a sound that's very new and fresh. The folk/rock rap sound heard in his first CD takes a larger role in the second. Dirty water which ft. Sam Roberts is suprisingly good, perhaps the best song. There are a couple misses on the cd which warrants the 4 stars instead of 5 but it's still a great cd. He fuses genres and makes something truly Canadian. An innovator with beats and lyrics that you only hear from K-os."
5,This album is craaaazy...,"Everything about this album is so infectious you can't help but get into it. k-os successfully represents the best points of hip-hop in this album. He is without a doubt one of the best Canadian emcees, and one of the best artists overall. You don't have to be into hip-hop to like this album. This is music at its finest, for everyone."
3,one good song on the CD,i got this because i liked the one good song on the CD and was hoping i would discover more good songs.sadly there are no more good songs.Everybody Loves Me is a great song and fun to listen to.the rest is ..... not so much.
3,LOW BUDGET STATE PROPERY,"I RENETED THIS MOVIE BECAUSE IM A FAN OF FREDDRO STARR AND HE WAS ON THE COVER. BUT HE IS NOT EDDIE BLACK. EDDIE BLACK IS A GOOD GUY TRYING TO BECOME A LAWYER. BUT HIS FRIENDS ARE INVOLVED IN A GANG. CAN EDDIE KEEP RUNNING WITH THE CAN AND NOT GET INVOLED IN GAND ACTIVITY? AND IF HE CONTINUSES TO HANG WITH HIS FRIEND WILL HE EVER BECOME A LAWYER? YOU HAVE TO WATCH THE MOVIE TO FIND OUT. THE MOVIE IS FULL IF BAD ACTORS. BUT THE DUDE DANIEL PHILIP , WHO PLAYS EDDIE IS A GOOD NEW COMER AND IS VERY SEXY! (DANIEL IF YOU READ THIS REVIEW HOLLA AT YOUR GIRL DOWN HERE IN JACKSONVILLE FL!! I WOULD HOLLA. CHECK MY PROFILE) BUT OVERALL THE MOVIE IS WORTH WATCHING AT LEAST ONCE."
5,Bert Lown's Music,What a treat to listen to the instruments talking to one another in Bert Lown's Orchestra. The variety of sounds is what makes this a collection to have. The singing is great too. The music of long ago lives on through Bert Lown and his talented musicians. The tunes tell of heartaches and love. It is upbeat and very fun to listen to.
4,Exceeds Expectations,"I purchased this book to learn more about Jackie Robinson and his relationship with Branch Rickey. Jules Tygiel gave me that (in an unbiased, thorough manner with great historical perspective) and then some! I gained an increased appreciation for the role of the Negro Leagues in the development of Major League baseball. I gained insight into the changing perceptions of baseball management, players and fans toward African-Americans and their contributions to the game. I was momentarily transported to that time, not as long ago as I would have thought, where non-white players were treated as second-class citizens. It was really an eye-opener. In addition, Mr. Tygiel's style was so honest and even-handed that I can't wait to read his book, ""Past Time: Baseball As History,"" which I ordered today!"
4,Well Done,"This scholarly yet readable look at baseball integration from 1947-1959 goes well beyond the inspiring story of Jackie Robinson and Branch Rickey. Author Jules Tygiel also informs about such secondary figures as Larry Doby, Bill Veeck, Hank Aaron, Pumpsie Green, etc. Tygiel shows that integration proceeded slowly and in the face of strong resistance - the Boston Red Sox didn't add a black player until 1959, three years after Jackie Robinson retired. We also see how baseball integration spurred civil rights, while hastening the end of the Negro Leagues. I'd have liked more coverage of baseball's declining attendance after 1949 (probably caused by television), and the suspected correlation between athletic dominance and underclass poverty. Still, BASEBALL'S GREAT EXPERIMENT is a well-researched look at an interesting period in sports history."
1,Not good reference for Arch Engineering PE Exam,"DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK IF YOU ARE STUDYING FOR THE NEW ARCHITECTURAL ENGINEERING PE EXAM - IT IS NOT USEFUL AT ALL. I bought this book as reference to study for and take the newly established Architectural Engineering PE exam and was sorely disappointed. The author fails in his self-proclaimed attempt to distill engineering design formulations into an easy-to-read format. The equations throughout the book are simply ""dumbed down"" linear statements of esoteric symbols with next to no regard to engineering notation conventions. The example problems may resemble some types of common design problems, but are rarely general enough to apply to varying situations. I didn;t refer eveon one time to any equation or example problem in this book when studying for or taking the actual PE exam in April 2003."
2,"Very detailed, but repetitive.","Pros: very detailed account of the crisis and gives a good brief overview of the cold war (before and after). Well documented sources and factual data including military units, policies, weapons, maps & charts.Cons: disorganized timeline and repetitive information throughout the book made it boring to read.In my opinion, the book would have been much better served if the chapters had been laid out in a daily timeline. The authors wrote chapters that describe in detail certain aspects if the crisis. The problem is that each chapter seems to tell the story of the crisis from the beginning. The further you get through the book, it's as if your rereading it for the third of fourth time. I went from eagerly wanting to read it to dreading to start the next chapters."
5,Sensitive treatment of timeless hymns,"Again, Bronn Journey has provided listeners with a touching and sensitive treatment of a carefully selected set of timeless hymns. For those who love beautiful music, the kind that ""soothes that savage breast,"" this CD will provide hours of calming, peaceful therapy for the soul."
1,Do Not Purchase,"I purchased this item in July 2012. It quickly fell apart, breaking open on the seams. It was much lighter than it should be. The insides fell out. I contacted the seller repeatedly to have it replaced and NEVER received any response. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT."
4,Great product,My husband and I started using this product a week ago. He has gout and it seems to he helping with reducing the pain & swelling during the flair up
1,Herbal shoulder wrap,I was thinking this would be higher quality. Its on the small side and fragrance from the oils is already gone. Your better off not buying...waste of money.
3,Bought for Mom,Bought for my mother. She suffers from neck and back pain and has stated that she likes to use it prior to going to bed.
4,"Nice, but cools quickly","I chose this to keep warm about the neck and shoulders, and it does that very well, but for a short time. It seems to cool faster than the rectangular one I use for my lap. Maybe that's because it's more exposed to the air. It has a lovely aroma and storing it in the resealable bag it came in helps keep it that way. The weight of it helps me relax my shoulders downward and that really helps melt stress, too. If they could make it with something that retains heat longer, I could give it 5 stars."
3,Not as good,"This wrap is ok, the last one I had was a bit heavier with more herbal scent. I use these daily due to medical problems. It also could hold the heat a bit better. It is however good to take back and forth to work or wherever you might need it since you can put it protected back in it's bag. With a few modicfications I would buy it again, however will continue to look for one more like the one I had."
3,Just okay.,"I got this because of all the great reviews. Its smelled nice but it really did not hold the heat well. It went from extremely hot and then lost its heat within 10-15 minutes. Also, it was a bit flimsy. The seeds moved around and created these empty spaces. I will be returning this."
3,Does the job,I find it takes somewhat more than 2 minutes in the microwave to heat this up to my liking but that's no real problem. Pellets (or whatever they are) in the wrap do shift around and you have to give it a good shake every now and then. Didn't appreciate having to pay have the total cost for shipping!
4,The Stone Thowers,Jackie Kays has done an excellent job with this work. His experience as an police officer and military man are born out in this book. It will grab your attention and keep it. This is one of those books that when you start you must go to the end non stop. The topic is as current in the continued contriversy of the Vietnam War and those that did or did not serve there. He done good.Mark Brooks
4,cheerful earful,"A very nice collection of music that was recorded in the months around the 1929 Stock Market crash, featuring Bunny Berigan, Mannie Klein, Tommy and Jimmy Dorsey, Joe Venuti and Eddie Lang and that pleasing singer Smith Ballew. Most tunes are up-tempo and some are downright great such as the second version of ""I Got Rhythm"" with its remarkable intro by Lang and Venuti, ""I'm Tickled Pink"" and ""Cheerful Little Earful"" and quite a few others. As always with TOM cd's, remastering is very fine, the liner notes are very informative; for the band personel I had to resort to an old World Records lp however (with notes by Brian Rust). You won't be able to stop tapping your feet with this cd in your machine."
4,Queen Anne Arm Chairs,These chairs are okay for the price if you are looking for extra seating. The arms could be a little higher as meant to be. Very easy to put together.
5,Around the world with music by an innovative banjo virtuoso,"I was at an outdoors event the first time I heard one of Alison's tracks (Deep North) from this CD - think: banjo + didgeridoo. It grabbed my ear, so I asked the man running the sound board about the tune. He fingered this CD for me, and I got it. The CD is a virtual world tour of musical genres with a progressive banjo spin to them.Maybe you know some of Bela Fleck's music? If yes, this CD will seriously entertain you."
3,Not the nice cotton ones I remember,"I had these panties in my drawer and they really are my favorite. I wanted some more and even though these have the same item number on the tag inside the garment, they're not quite the same. These are more of a slippery material, rather than my nice comfy cotton ones I already had. They're still very comfortable and wear well, but I prefer the non-slippery cotton."
4,Good choice for Me,"These Vanity Fair ""Illumination"" briefs are great for woman who like the coverage and comfort of briefs, but also like a smooth, satin-like appearance."
3,Read the book but don't always believe it.,"Primary source written by one of the ""Big Three"". Lloyd-George attempts to defend his actions at the conference and salvage his reputation. Written after the British public begins to turn against the treaty. So L-G is spending a lot of time re-writing his motivations."
3,"Quality work, very small in scope","This campaign was a minor operation compared to what the other Battlefield DVD's covered (ie. Stalingrad, D-Day, Battle of Britain), and has very limited footage and a lot of recycled shots and obviously stretched out narration. This would make a decent chapter in a multi-campaign DVD, but as a stand alone it just did not have enough material to justify the length."
5,Nice Shirt,"Very nice quality. I ended up buying two. I bought XL and it did not shrink and was larger than the standard XL. But due to the nice quality, I ordered and L for wearing to school. The XL is great for relaxing at home. Just know the sizes run large."
5,This is one cool shirt. Great quality and sweet logo,My USAF leaning son had not seen this new logo before I ordered the shirt for Santa. Before the shirt arrived he stumbled on the new logo telling me how sweet it was. Santa delivered his load and the logo is way cooler in person and the shirt was of a very good quality.(I secretly want one too)
4,GOOD SHOW,"A good live set with Donald Byrd on trumpet and Jackie McLean on alto sax from the Cafe Bohemia 9/55. Evidently these were the only 6 tunes recorded. Every time they played one of these, they recorded it and then used the best take for the LP. Other tunes played but not recorded probably showed up on the PRESENTING JACKIE McLEAN session with Donald on trumpet and Mal Waldron on piano recorded the following month. Maybe they even played A Foggy Day from Jack's LIGHTS OUT session with Don and Elmo Hope 1/56- who knows.-----Anyway the highlights here are the great Wallington tune Sweet Blanche, and Jay Mac's Crib based on Softly as in a Morning Sunrise. There are no trio tracks and George always solos after both hornmen are finished soloing. Paul Chambers is on bass and Art Taylor is the drummer."
5,vit d defiency,"I am prescribed 3xweek. no stomach upset, can take with or without food. take only if prescribed. vit d can be toxic."
3,D3 Vit,"Waiting before I write a review......I will post when I have a more informed decision, after labs are completed, soon"
2,Reaction to this product,"This might work for some, but I had a bad reaction to this product. I took one and then a week later took another, and my legs ached constantly. I could not sleep and it felt like my legs were swollen and weak. I quit taking it and have not had that anymore. It might work for some, but it was not for me."
5,great product,This has brought my vitamine D level up to where it belongs.My doctor recomended it and checks every few months to see ifI'm doing ok.
1,Poor Quality at High Price,"I received this robe in December (as a self-bought Christmas present). I was thoroughly disappointed. The robe was huge, moreover it was of really poor quality. For the price, I was expecting a lot better. I sent this item back and asked for a refund, due to my total displeasure with this item - to my surprise it was sent back to me for being one day late. I received on 12/20 and they received it back on 1/20. Technically 31 days. Shame on them - amount should have been refunded anyway due to my complete disatisfaction with the quality of the item. I strongly suggest against dealing with this company - if not only for thier bad form in returns - for the poor quality of their products."
2,Water Damaged,"I already had a copy of this and my grandson started looking thru. He just loved it, so I ordered him one of his own. I paid very little for, as I recall, but did Not see water damage anywhere in the description."
4,This is the same DVD,"Please note that this is the same DVD that Amazon sells, under the same title, with the book and DVD together. I felt pretty bone-headed when I ended up with two of the same DVD!"
2,"Ian Tyson, Cowboy of the CENTURY Rides again","Ian is my favorite western singer and song writer, but I wasn't crazy about this CD...maybe it is me but he did better CD's after this one so he is not finished...just stood in the wrong horse stall this time around."
5,Great,Item as described fit like a glove. Working great as of today and looks goods. I plan to keep the car for few more years so I paid the extra money in order to get the quality.
2,"Pretty, but damaged","This product arrived severely damaged with big knicks and scratches. We returned it for a new one. It still had some knicks and scratches on the shelves. They sent us replacement shelves. They still had imperfections, but out of frustration - we have decided to live with it as is. The design and color are beautiful, but the quality is not great."
4,Couldn't Put this down,"I read this in just a few days while on vacation. I couldn't put it down. Once I was done, my adult daughter picked it up and read thru it non stop also.I see some awful reviews on this book from men. That is probably because Lindsay shows the double standard the CIA has for the genders. Eg men can see hookers, women are told to be careful how their romantic lives might affect their careers.I particularly enjoyed reading about her recruitment process, and the training she endured. It was also entertaining to read about some of her co-workers' (and trainers') odd personalities etc.Lindsay displays many cababilities, along with ineptitude, of our federal government. She also shows the impossibilities of being in the CIA while also having a satisfying personal life.It was difficult reading thru some of her awful assignments in some horrid area of some awful country where one couldn't even use the dirty public swimming pool.Thanks for the good read!!!"
1,this person should be ashamed of herself,"After reading this book I still do not understand why she wanted to join the CIA in the first place. The whole time she was working she thought about how awful it was and that she could not take drugs with her friends and how this job kept her from finding a man. She sounded like a 13 year old girl rather than a well educated woman of 30 years of age. There were many parts in the book where she talked about how this position made her feel like she was doing something unethical. She knew what this position was about and she only started to ask herself questions about the ethics in this position after she was took the job. She was not a likable character but rather a uncertain, whiny brat who has no idea what she was doing or wanted to do or even why she was doing it. She did not like the government and was very much a leftist hippie, so why she did this I dont know. I just do not understand how she was not cut in the CIA hiring process."
5,Captivating!,I couldn't put this book down.Moran does an excellent job of taking the reader inside the secret world of the CIA.If you've ever harbored any desire to be a spy this is the book you should read. Pay close attention to Moran's description of her experience at The Farm. I found myself laughing while at the same time nervous as she skillfully undertook each training assignment.
3,More about Lindsay Moran than the CIA,"Girl joins CIA, girl meets BOY, girl quits CIA. That is the story in a nutshell. Ms. Moran would have us believe she quit the CIA because of her ""integrity"" however, she knew from the start what she would be doing (recruiting foreigners to spy on their own governments for the U.S.) and yet she chose to do it for several years anyway. Throughout the book she complains that her social life has taken a hit because she has to constantly lie to everyone about who she is and what she does for a living. She makes it very clear that her CIA career is preventing her from having quality friendships and romances. It appears that her real motivation for quitting was that she wanted to lead a normal life. You can't really blame her. I wouldn't want to live a life of lies either. The book would have been better without her critique of the CIA and why it failed on 9-11, because her few years with the organization don't exactly make her an expert on that topic."
2,Self-Absorbed and Immature,"I disliked this book immensely. I found Ms. Moran to be self-absorbed and immature. Based on the way she presented herself in the beginning, I'm surprised that any professional organization hired her. There were many points where it appeared she was trying to be negative intentionally and came off as whining. Although she was applying for a government job that would require a clearance, she was ignorant of the procedures involved that the level of trust she would be given. Please do not read this book."
2,Boring,"This was the worst spy memoirs I ever read. Mrs Moran haven't served in the service long enough to be engaged in any serious actions or willingly decided not to reveal the detail. Due to that there's no much going on. This is a book about someones ""job title"", not interesting life. Waste of time."
2,Amusing book.,"Lindsay Moran is a Harvard graduate and Rhodes Scholar (two facts she never lets you forget) turned bumbling case officer for the CIA. More interested in cocktail parties, rock climbing and Bulgarian men, she is assigned to the Former Yugoslavian Republic of Macedonia and sets to work developing third-rate assets and babysitting worthless contacts that have been assigned to her. After 9-11 she becomes tired of working for the CIA and quits to write freelance articles. Moran's style is light and breezy. Very little substance and no character development."
4,Don't shoot the messenger,"Unlike some of the previous reviewers, I think Moran's book does a credible job of exposing the dysfunctional culture and practice of the CIA. US taxpayers should know that millions if not billions of dollars go into intelligence gathering with dime-store results. Moran descirbes it all; the silly spy-games at the Farm, living it up at taxpayers expense on first-class airplane seats and meals at fancy French restaurants and most disturbing, the throwing of large sums of money at pathetic recruits with very little ""intelligence"" to offer. While Moran might pat herself on the back a little too much, she should be credited for describing an agency that has operated behind close doors for way too long and has failed the American people as 9/11 tragically proved."
1,Better than sleeping pills,"This book offered more than it delivered. Banal. Her skills deserve better description. After two tries, I gave up trying to read through it."
5,This Was A Great Read,"Not only was this woman's story enjoyable to read, but it also offered a point of view of the life of a CIA case officer that I had not found in any other book. It's very informative to read about the drawbacks and personal misgivings one might have in that type of career field. I love how the author exposes what the agency is like for female case officers who also yearn for the honest closeness of others. It was a really fun read, I couldn't put the book down!"
2,The CIA IS in trouble...,"if Lindsay Moran is the type of agent they recruit. Sheesh...was she really expecting the life of a spy to be like a James Bond movie? Naw, Lindsay's probably a Matt Helm wanna-be. And what's with the slam against the war in Iraq? A couple of folks she knows say they know nothing of WMD or connections with Al-Q and she quits her job? I am SO sick of these hate America first club members...you think any country is perfect, Lindsay? Pshaw!"
1,Do Not Waste Your Money!!!!,"This book is everything many reviewers have already said. It is all about a whiney Harvard grad who brags about being better than everyone else. The CIA was ""just an itch that she needed to scratch"" and ""something to check off her list in life"". If you want to listen to some dumb bimbo complain and whine about not being able to find a man and continuously wonder what she is doing at the CIA then be my guest.It is true that this book had some interesting info about 'The Farm' and the training recruits go through, but that was the only redeeming quality.This book was simply written so that she could disparage the agency, pay off her Harvard education and jump on her soapbox to let everyone know that Iraq was a mistake because she knows better than anyone. Please don't waste your time. If you absolutely must check this out, then get it from the library. You'll be glad you did."
5,The Ins & Outs of a Biz You Don't Hear About Often,"This book is awesome: hilarious, easy-to-read, fun, and will make you a LOT more savvy about how the world works -- meaning (specifically) the spy trade, the ideolog(ies) of those who ply it (& the often accompanying job-induced emotional/empathetic numbness), and how people in ""Third World"" (i.e., Eastern European countries) get by on a day-to-day basis.And (like physicist Janna Levin), the author's CUTE!(Sorry though, fellas, she's married.)"
3,Blowing My Cover,"To be honest, I feel as if she had a horrible attitude from the beginning and I did not one time expect her to enjoy her job. I mean honestly, the job is extremely demanding and a huge commitment and from the beginning I did not feel as if she could handle it. She seems to have a negative outlook on life in general and I think I would want the opinion of someone more optimistic."
2,I wanted to love it...but ended up bored.,"Blowing my Cover is a young woman's memoir of a short-lived CIA career. The middle and end of the book were intesting (CIA training and post 9/11). The rest was boring. Moran actually writes that she was destined for a CIA spy job because she liked to treasure hunt as a child! Yawn. Moran never convinced me that she really wanted to be in the CIA or that she was truly ""wired"" as a spy. Her motivations for getting out were believable but that doesn't happen until the last 40 or so pages. I found myself skimming the middle of the book to find out why she ultimately left. Moran's book has some interesting tidbits about becoming a spy but it lacks passion and emotion."
2,Disappointing book,"What starts off interestingly enough, loses its spark early in the book. Moran gets bogged down in mundane, boring details that turns this potentially intriguing story into ho-hum. Moran also has questionable judgement in a couple of situations such as watching porn on tv while TDY and telling a boyfriend she works for the CIA. The book mainly is focused in Bulgaria, a section that basically has no point and could be reduced to a chapter. It also gets tiresome to read how well she does in all her training and as a new agent, coming across to the reader as arrogant. I was expecting a wittier, more engrossing book. Cannot recommend this."
2,Embarrassing for intelligence officers..,"If you're looking for a 'silly' account of CIA case officer ""Carrie Bradshaw"" (a la Sex in the City), then you might be amused with this title. That is, as TheBookOfHonor said below, if you can stand Moran's rather elitist childish attitude. While reading the book I often had to remind myself that the author was older than sixteen, along with being a Harvard graduate (she'll remind you plenty, trust me). Goes to show you that intellect doesn't always equal maturity....I'm just slightly disturbed to see that the CIA didn't pick up on this. Hmm.If you're looking for a more serious and mature individual's account of working for the CIA, I would suggest one of Robert Baer's books."
2,Not for beginners,"This text is for those who have some experience in genre analysis and are more than ""familiar"" with the terminology of the field. Students new to linguistic analysis had difficulty understanding the reading, so it was not helpful for an introduction to analysis of written communication. It is otherwise fine and some parts are a good example of semiotic text."
4,"beautiful, dazzling, brilliant FAERIE TALE!","FAERIE TALE THEATRE's production of BEAUTY AND THE BEAST makes for dazzling family entertainment, with strong performances from lead actors Susan Sarandon and Klaus Kinski in the title roles.Beauty's merchant father steals a white rose from the castle of the Beast (Klaus Kinski). As punishment, the Beast orders that the merchant return to the castle in 3 days, or else one of his daughters must go in his place. Youngest daughter Beauty (Susan Sarandon) selflessly sacrifices her own freedom to release her father.Once in the castle, Beauty slowly begins to win the friendship and trust of the Beast, who hides a gentle and kind heart beneath his frightening exterior.Directed by Roger Vadim and co-starring Anjelica Huston and Nancy Lenehan as Beauty's jealous sisters, this version of BEAUTY AND THE BEAST is based on Jean Cocteau's celebrated French movie classic. Highly-recommended."
1,Skip This One,"When I think of the Faerie Tale Theatre series, I think of off-kilter humor and lightheartedness. Sadly, this effort features neither of those qualities.Basically, this is a straight-laced retelling of the classic French tale; full of doom-and-gloom and many long, forlorn stares. Nothing to excite the kiddies of pull in the adults.Guest stars include Klaus Kinski, Susan Sarandon, and Angelica Huston.Skip this one altogether and stick with the Disney animated version."
2,Better options out there,"Pros - kickstand is nice and sturdy, case looks nice, feels good in my hand and has a nice grip on the sides. holes match up nicely.Cons - case seems a little too small because the edges dont fit all the way on correctly, kind of hard to explain but its not a 100% fit.the white turned into a yellowish color after a week so i dont even use this case any more. it was a waste of money. i wish i wouldve atleast got a different color because the kickstand was really nice to use.Overall i wouldnt buy this case again just because of the edges not fitting tightly on the phone. Wish i could get a refund."
4,Comments on Scienc of Self-Control,"I am writing this review after only reading excerpts of the book. It is well written, with cogent examples that can act as a ""How-to"" book. Although based on science, it is clear enough to be understood by most, and should be helpful to all."
5,Delightful to read and see!,"John Willy and Freddy McGee have a wonderful time, and so will anyone else who reads this delightful book. This book is perfect for reading aloud. The story flows so well you might miss the beautiful illustrations-so take your time and read it over and over! This is a definite ""must have"" for any child's library. Thanks Holly."
5,Great Read,"This book challenges you when you read it. You do really have to meditate after each of his thoughts to try to fully understand what the author intended when he wrote the thought. I personally believe every person's faith is different and molded by life events around them. There are obvious ""passages"" that you can quickly identify with as your own, but also numerous thoughts that you have to remember how Escriva grew up in order to understand, and especially remember his role during the Spanish Civil War when priests were murdered in the streets and his own parish had their church burned to the ground. It is a very inspiring book, and while you may not agree with every thing he has written, it does make you want to become a better person of faith which I think is why he wrote his thoughts down in the first place."
3,A.k.a. La Gringa,"This film is loosely based on the life of a peruvian criminal and his experiences at an island prison called ""El Fronton"" -a sort of Peruvian ""Alcatraz""-. It also portraits the infamous 1986 Terroist Riot (although the real ""Gringa"" was not there at the time). Being a low budget film don't expect fancy or sophisticated explosions and special effects. If you are into ""B"" Movies with a South American touch, then this is your thing."
4,"consistently good, with a perfect crema insert","Okay, I don't use a $2000 espresso machine as Mister SMB from Honolulu, mine cost about 1/10 of that. And I use the perfect crema insert for the portafilter, so I do not depend on precise tamping. But then I get consistently pretty good espresso with a nice crema! Definitely more consistently good than my sampling of various Starbucks. After switching from over-prized illy (which Whole Foods sells for 3 times the money, maybe you pay for the nice can?) I have never looked back and I have gone through about 80 bricks of this Lavazza over the last 3 years.For at least the last couple of boxes I bought the Lavazza label says ""For use in home espresso machines"". I take this means ""use the perfect crema insert""."
1,Only if you have no other Capercaille albums,"This album would only be appropriate for those who would like to have 1 Capercaille album and no more. Those who already have most or all of the albums will only find 2 tracks they probably don't already have, and the CD is not worth the price of those 2 tracks. There is only 1 cut from their almost unobtainable first album (non-CD I believe) as well as 1 or 2 from Glenfinnan, only available through mail-order. But again, those cuts are not worth buying this collection for."
4,Awsome piece of black metal art,"85/100While I've only heard this release and Angelgrinder, this blows the later away. If you like melodic black metal then buy this."
5,Great Book!,This book is full of information and advice by someone who obviously knows her stuff. It's by far the best gardening book I have ever purchased.
5,Pleased recipient,"I enjoyed an earlier copyright of this book and the new one is improved. Great reference for any gardener, especially those that want to do the best they can with the perennials."
2,Not for the Average Gardener,"We found this book to be more for the advanced gardener than the first-timer. There are not enough photos of the plants, and they are listed by their scientific names as opposed to their common names. A cross-reference would have been nice.We were disappointed."
4,"Excellent, practical advice for novices and more","I've been gardening for 4 years and I learned a few really useful things from Tracy's book; enough to keep it on my list of ""most wanted"" gardening books. There is a great deal of information on preparing beds, soil amendment, planting and some creative pruning ideas. I think of this book the same way I think of Jaques Pepin's ""La Technique"" when it comes to cooking. It's a basic, a classic, and it should be on your shelf, or better yet in front of you."
5,You GOTTA Love Zac,"Like I said you gotta love him!! I bought this book and finished it in one day because I couldn't put it down. I just loved all the tests,Quzzies, and all the facts. I would reccomend this book to human Beings not Aliens O.K"
4,Perfect Quick Read.q,"Perfect coffee table book. Obviously a quick read, with loads of informatin for the true Denim Head."
4,A Fun and Challenging Game,"The graphics are very good, but not as impressive as Sonic's Adventure. There are some problems controlling the camera shots, which can be very annoying when you're trying to hop from place to place. The dialogue between the characters interrupts the gameplay as well. Rayman is a lot of fun, despite these problems and is easy to master once you know what you're doing. So, pick up a copy and enjoy!"
2,Not The Rayman We All Know And Love,"Although a lot of people liked this game I hated it. For one thing this game was WAAAAYYYYYY too easy (I beat this game in three days playing only 1 hour a day! The first game had me playing for mounths! )! You're supposed to find this fairy to give you all your powers back, and yet you start the game with all your powers! Plus I don't care how good the graphics are, Rayman does NOT look good in 3D and does not belong in 3D! So get the first game, I don't recomend this game to ANYONE!"
4,Definitely a good buy,"I bought myself a used Dreamcast last year, and so far Rayman 2 has been one of the best games I have for it.For fans of the Playstation version, it is a slight disappointment that there aren't actual voices for the cutscenes, which was something that added to the game.There are some better things about it, though. For one, the frames per second is 60, as oppose to the PS1 version's 30. The graphics are very sharp, and the animation is very well done.The levels are slightly different than its Playstation counterpart, and involves more maneuvers and features. Also, there is an exclusive multiplayer level found only on the Dreamcast version.All in all, I would definitely recommend this game to anyone who still has a working Dreamcast. Oh, and it only takes up two blocks of memory space on the VMU, so memory is not an issue. Unless you only have one block."
3,Its average I think.,"I am a graphic designer and was looking for inspiration for some apparel designs. But a lot of the stuff in this book is the trendy pop-art rip-offs or deconstructive designs that look like they were drawn on the shirt with a marker. I think I may have been happier just buying a big book of logos. If you get to design shirts with ALOT of creative freedom, then maybe this is the book for you.The part of the book I like the most is the actual ""100% cotton"" section where well qualified designers took the 100% cotton theme and designed something for a plain white T-shirt, and explained their thoughts behind it. But this was only about 20 pages in the book.I think this book is average for a design book. I dont have any other T-shirt design books so I can't say how it compares to others. If you can get it , its not a bad deal."
1,Not worth a purchase,"The author completely misses the mark with the title. It should be ""How to be Fire Photographer Groupie"". The author is apparently a civilian photographer with no law enforcement , crime scene investigation experience. The major topics covered are private investigator fire photographer applications with no real technical advice. He seems to justify the lack of technical advice by stating early on that he assumes the reader knows this information. My guess is the author lacks real world experience and does not know what really happens at a crime scene. Take a pass on this book."
2,Disappointing and out of date,"I bought this book as I need to be better at taking photographs during investigations of workplace injury incidents and hoped it would help.It was therefore disappointing to find that the book (published in 2000) mostly offered suggested reading that was 20 to 30 years old.The equipment suggestions were also dated (even allowing that the book might have been prepared in 1999).The subject range was mostly in the range of police and fire service work even though forensic work can cover much more ground.This is the most expensive textbook I have bought for many years, and so, overall, it was not good value for money for me."
4,It's worth the price I got it for,It's not the best out there but I got it for under $15 and it does have good information in it.
1,Barely above the readability level,"After reading this book (and throwing it in the trash), I read the reviews that are posted here and was amazed that there were a couple of readers that actually enjoyed it, and intend to read more! The author's attempt to invoke a level of emotions tied to the 'southern' ideal; God, country and family at any cost, is a great example of someone who has possibly attended a beginner-level writing class, but ignored the basics. Perhaps his target audience is the same people who would recognize his name from the gun manuals he has published. I will not read another of his books.."
3,Debut page turner,"Need to pass some time without too much heavy lifting- this is for you. Good action, not a lot of plausibility. A hero who seems able to do and know everything, while still being a sensitive family man,is the center of this first in a series."
2,Right-wing morality tale,"Kirkus review is on the mark. The hero of this story is a redneck's dream in that he has the correct weapon, plan or marshal arts discipline ready to use at exactly the moment required. You will get a kick out of how he finds the hideout of the bad guys; visiting neighborhood convenience stores, he notices that one of them sells mexican food. He bribes the owner of the store ($5) to tell him who buys tortillas in this area. Wow. Also, his reparte with the members of his team grow wearisome to the extreme in a very short time. Reminds me of Robert Heinlein at his worst. Can you Grok it"
1,Minutemen reunited...,"Gun-toting, bible-thumping rednecks from Lower Hollow, North Carolina save Bosnia from the bad guys. I haven't read anything so bad since... (No, I've never read anything this bad). This man writes from a formula that he has down pat. I wonder if his gun manuals are written in the same style. Every situation he gets into is instantly solved either by his martial-arts prowess (taught to him by some unseen USArmy group that carried out political assasinations in Korea) or by one of several guns that he keeps around him. Scary guy.."
2,Author should stick to gun manuals,"Everybody in this book seems to be armed to the teeth day and night. The law, of course, turns the other way (because, as all rednecks know, they are hamstrung by the court system), and this group of vigilantes is given free rein. I would not read another of this man's books"
2,NUTS AND BOLTS,"BE CAREFUL OF THIS SOFTWARE, IT CREATED A SOFTWARE CONFLICT WITH MY LAPTOP. I HAD DIALOGUE BOXES WITH BOGUS WARNINGS COMING UP AND HAD A DIFFICULT TIME GETTING IT OUT. THE REGULAR UNINSTALLER DIDN'T GET IT OUT-I HAD TO GET UNINSTALLER AND IT TOOK SEVERAL TIMES TO GET IT OUT."
1,Leave it on the shelf!,"Nuts and Bolts does more against your system than it actually fixes. First of all, it loads a bunch of junk into your memory and slows your PC down, even though it says it will optimize and tune up your computer. And its utilities included in it sometimes crash, and I don't see how this helps the computer run better. My advice is to just leave it on the shelf!"
4,Not a thing like gasoline,"Stuff smells great! it's got just an edge of the actually diesel smell to it, but only the part we like about the smell. It's smooth, a little musky, and still has a bit of citrus-ey crispness to it!definitely worth the buy"
3,Would Like More Detail,"It is really hard to find self study books on Leviticus, Numbers and Deuteronomy, so from that perspective the book the great. However, I was using the ""LifeChange"" series for Genesis and Exodus and really liked that format better. The questions in LifeChange provoke more thought regarding the readings. The book by Kay Arthur doesnt provide as many thought provoking questions. I intend to use her books for the bible books not covered by LifeChange, but will probably go back to LifeChance when they cover a particular bible book."
4,Excellent study guide,"I'm learning a whole lot from this study guide. Having the matching Bible helps, as does some familiarity with Kay Arthur's method, but she guides you through it in the text. There's lots of questions and keywords to help me focus and engage with the text more fully. Study helps and resources are also good, though only after you've read the text for yourself first. However, it's rather easy to read a passage too narrowly and miss all kinds of meaning, and the study guide doesn't really give me a lot to help prevent this. My only complaint is that I don't agree with some of her doctrine, and she sometimes uses leading questions to imply that what she believes is what the Bible teaches. But since the idea is to ""discover for yourself,"" it's easy enough to disagree with her. Overall, a really good Bible study, though not for people unfamiliar with the Bible."
5,Teach me your ways,very good series. This is the second book that I have used in my Sunday School class and we are digging in together to learn from God's word.
2,Teach Me Your Ways,"I have done previous studies with Kay Arthur that were good, covered the Book of the Bible we were studying, and had some great insight. This isn't one of them. I was certainly disappointed in the book for study purposes."
4,Great classic game.,"I first encountered this game waaaaaaay back in grade-school, and it was on display on the PS1 vs whatever was on the Sega Saturn. Despite buying the Saturn (and paying the price for that but the console-wars are beyond the scope of this review), I always had this little bugger in the back of my mind.Finally, after probably 10+ years later, I finally got curious enough to purchase this. It has an old-school, twitchy feel to it reminiscent of some of the NES games I used to play. I'm glad I bought it."
5,Love this book!,"My mom read this to me and my 4 sisters when we were little, and now I am reading this to my daughter. This is a great book. Pictures are bright and colorful and the story is just great. My 4 year old daughter loves it."
4,Such memories,"I purchased this book because it was my son's favorite book when he was little. I sent it to him for his 21st birthday to remind him that even though he is ""grown up"" he will still always be the little boy that I read to hour after hour. This was the first book that he learned to read and it will always be so special to us. Ordering and receiving the book, which was in wonderful condition was actually a gift for the both of us. Thank you!"
5,But No Elephants,This is a classic that I wore out the hardbound with my older children. I purchcased this copy as a baby shower gift and was pleased that it arrived on time!!
5,There is a lesson to be learned,I have loved this book since my daughter (now 31) was very small. It is charming and teaches a great lesson...
5,My favorite!!!!,"I can't believe more people haven't reviewed this book. When I was four years old, I couldn't get enough of this book. It was also my brother's favorite, so my mother has undoubtedly read this book hundreds of times. I bought it for my kids, and they love it too. Although the book is a quick read, the illustrations really make this one. To make this one long enough for bedtime we talk about the pictures. We think that the best page is the last, but my kids can recall little favorite things from almost every page. My kids give this book five stars. They say it isn't their best book, but it makes the top ten. I'm sure it would rank higher if they had fewer to choose from."
5,Classic!,"This was one of my favorite books growing up, so I definitely wanted to get it for my daughters. It makes me feel all warm and fuzzy. Wish it came in hardback!"
2,Terra Lux TLW-60 short battery life,"I've had a Terra Lux TLW-60 for a few months now. The unit produces bright light when plugged in, and pretty good light under battery power when the battery is charged. But I found that the battery did not retain it's charge for very long when new and now, after only a few months, the battery is BAD! The unit will not retain a charge and will only light if kept plugged in. Battery is completely dead and company website FAQ says no replacement is possible, says to ""dispose of the unit"". How could they willfully design this product to be limited to the (shorter than expected) life of the battery? Bad design! I will not buy from them again."
