3,"Excellent!...but a little outdated...written in early 90s, an update would be useful","The book is a little outdated, but extremely well written, informative and useful. Very good advice. Alot of topics covered. It was written in the early 90s, so much has changed. No chapter on email correspondence, for example. I would give it 4 stars now, but the system wouldn't let me change my review."
5,decent product,"i use this everyday, it fits in one of my home built pc's in the second cdrom slot. it sounds good enough for listening to internet videos and music at my work desk and just plain doesn't suck. they aren't bose quality but hey whaddaya expect for the price"
3,internal pc speaker,Works as advertised...easy to install...comes with all hardware and screws.It works OK...but; don't expect to be able to listen to music withoutdistortion on this unit. It handles basic Internet Audio fairly well.
5,Gorgeous on the inside... a real inspiration.,"This book is humble and gorgeous and accessible and really, really astounding. His photos are beautiful and all taken in and around his home. Patterns and shapes, a close-up photo of a fork with its tines curled, gentle portraits of friends who have stopped by to visit the author at his home... wonderful stuff. This is not a technical book so much as it is a book that helps you to rediscover ways of seeing - especially, new ways of looking at the things around you as something worth inspiring your photography.You can't help but read this and want to start shooting at home."
5,Inspirational Book,"This book is a revelation. Andrew Sanderson is a great communicator and could be in the room with you when he describes how to make great images from everyday objects. This is not a how-to book, rather as others have mentioned, it is inspirational and would be a boon to people on a low travel budget or handicapped photographers for whom getting out is problematical. What I like is Andrew's down-to-earth language, the book is worth buying for the text alone. The black & white pictures look as if they come from another era but it only takes a small adjustment of the imagination to adapt to one's own style of photography.I liked this so much that I immediately bought a copy for my daughter-in-law."
3,COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER,"I liked this book. It will give you lots of ideas for some home photography. The photos are artsy and in black and white. All of them appear to have been made with very basic equiptment and with available light. They do not appear glamouous or have that pro look, so just about anyone with a camera could duplicate the author's work. The text does not reasonably explain how the photos were taken and no technical information is given, however, most shots are reproducable with some very basic knowledge of photography. I am sure the book can give anyone some good ideas. I would have liked to see some color. But maybe it's in his next assignment."
4,Good for the price,"I installed this product a couple of months ago and love the space saving design. Installation was a bit tricky, but if your handy you'll be able to figure it out...On the other hand, if your not handy, find someone who is. All in all I'm very satisfied with the overall quality and price of this product."
3,KV Door Mount Slide out Double bin,A little more unstable when opening closing door than a competing product (Home Depot) that cost about 40% less. Works OK though.
1,Difficult,I am a biginner and this is not for a biginner. So i shoud do more research before I buy again.
2,"Not so ""awesome you guys""","This is the antithesis of what I consider ideal yoga instruction. She talks too much and her speech is much too fast and frantic, in direct contrast to her verbal cues to relax and take your time. The wind in the microphone was also distracting and there wasn't a lot of flow to the sequencing. Alas, having the genetics that make you look like a skinny twelve-year old doesn't make you a yoga professional."
5,Great substitute when you can't get to a yoga class!,"Like several other reviewers, I am an intermediate practitioner, and I go to classes almost every day. As another reviewer said, the practice is very balanced and a good well-rounded work out. This is very similar to the intermediate classes I attend--ending the practice and starting savasana at 48:00 minutes. This sequence really got my heart rate up, and I broke a sweat-- BUT the pace is not too rushed (as are so many of the vinyasa DVDs). Very nicely paced, and the models show variations. However, I wouldn't recommend this for a beginner. It is probably a little too challenging for a newbie."
3,Get the Vintage one,Do yourself a favor and buy the Vintage version of Ponda Baba instead of this one. It's a lot better and has a removable arm. You can find the vintage version here:Star Wars 3.75 Vintage Figure Ponda Boba
3,Nothing special here,"Well it fits and looks good, but it's preformance is kinda lacking. The original battery for my phone held a charge much longer. It also seemed like every charge wouldn't last as long as the previous. I'm not going to lie becauseit was better than my really old warn down battery, but just nothing special here but an inexpencive replacement."
5,This Little Light of Mine...,"A young boy of modest means seeks a job to contribute to the needs of his family. Initially, his father is disappointed in the lowly responsibility that his son fulfills. The young man takes inspiration from his sister's admiration of him and finds that his job as a humble lamplighter blesses others beyond his understanding. The breath-taking illustrations span the entire two-page spread. This is a beautiful story of how everyone has their important role in life and can embrace it with excellence and passion."
2,not worth $11.82!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"this book does not paint detailed pictures with words.. extremely long book, i read 3 to 5 hours a day and have been reading this book for atleast 2 weeks.. if you like this genre, you WILL LOVE ""APACHE"" (british apache pilots) or ""US NAVY SEA WOLVES"" (gunships in vietnam) these books blow ""snake pilot"" outta the sky......."
1,Hhhhhhmmmmmmm,"Yes well .... It's not my intention to be disrespectful to Randy Zahn who undoubtedly had a story to tell. In truth though he didn't tell it. I felt sorry for his long suffering family who seemed to cop it in the neck at every opportunity and all attempts to offer him some support. There were moments when I thought the story was really going to take off. I wanted it to, I believed it would, but it never did. After having read Chicken Hawk and Low Level Hell, both un-put-downable, in truth I was disappointed. Having been a gunship pilot in Vietnam Mr Zahn has my utmost respect. He undoubtedly undertook extremely hazardous missions and had a worthy story to tell. I wanted to hear it, he just didn't tell it."
5,A nice hug for Qual,"What can a book tell you about a strange lady who loves her AH-1Z? Let's ""pull pitch"" in the words of this book and find out."
2,"Should Be Called ""Snake Pilot: Missing Home & Whining About it in Vietnam""","Sure, everyone's going to hate me when they read this, but maybe I'll save someone like me from reading this. After reading Low Level Hell by Hugh Mills (couldn't put it down!), I thought I had to read Snake Pilot. Now I know that I could've skipped it. I am sure that war is hell to go through, that people miss their families, that the Army doesn't always take care of their own, etc, etc. Having said that, this account is really a lot more about having a lame time in Vietnam than ""Flying the Cobra Attack Helicopter in Vietnam"". I was really looking for more operational info, mission sorties, weapon load outs, hair raising tales, things like that. The author seemed to overlook most of that though. Maybe he was trying to spare the casual reader the technical mumbo-jumbo, and make it more about his personal demons. Just not what I wanted to read about though."
2,Snake Pilot,"I have not quite finished the book. The author has vocused too much on the mundane personal stuff on his base. The book is well written but boring. He fly's a lot but does not relate much in his flying missions. I will finish the book, because I paid for it. My son fly's an Apache.Jeff Stewart"
4,ok,Used it for some time and the result was ok. Not too many failures. But the price of 700MB cd is about the same as the 4.7GB dvd now.
4,Cute and witty,Sabrina the teenage witch competes in a witch's spelling bee(a spell-casting contest)and her prize is a reality check(a cheque she can cash in to change any event of her choice)Only problem is that EVERYTHING is going wrong so how is a girl to decide what to change?!!!!!!!!!!Life's hard!
5,A bewitching good time.,"Reality Check (Sabrina The Teenage Witch)is a great book. I could read it over and over again. It's fun reading about all the trouble that she gets herself into, and how she gets herself out of it. It's fun and easy to read. Everybody should read it."
4,A great collection of the range of music at Sunsplash 92,"This CD, collecting some of the top performances from the 1992 Reggae Sunsplash, festival has apparently just been re-released, and what a great thing that is. This is an eclectic collection of the type of performances found at Sunsplash, and will surely please the fans of both dancehall and roots. Top selections include Bad Boy (the Dreds/Morgan Heritage) and Wolves and Leopards (Dennis Brown). If you like collecting reggae compilations, I would choose this one quickly!!"
2,Why Bother?,"Most of the information in this book is available online. I bought it because it was required for a college course, then I never even opened it."
4,Finally a book that answers questions,"Glad I bought this book. The Star Wars RPG left many questions about weapons and technology open. This book answers about 30% of those questions, which is a lot of material."
3,Exactly as described,The book was exactly as described and the price was great. Exactly what we were looking for. Thanks so much!
4,Great!,"I purchased this for my 4 yr old son. He loves this book. He needs help with cutting/pasting , but overall he looks forward to do this activity"
3,Tipical Orientalist,"I GREW UP IN A MIDDLE CLASS SAUDI FAMILY AND READ THE WHOLE BOOK.John R. Bradley goes to Saudi Arabia for 2 years, befriends upper class kids and some liberal journalists then thinks he figured out the whole country. These are some things you should know before you read the book:-When a teenage boy has a satellite in his room he is rich even in Saudi Arabia. Same thing goes for students who hire a Briton to teach them English and for kids with fluent English.-Average Saudis will not talk to foreigners especially not westerners.-The book was written in June 2005 and Saudi Arabia is rapidly changing (for better or worse)-This was before the new king came to power.-The people he speaks of are not representative sample of the Saudi society(mostly pro-American liberal)-Any other orientalist could not have done a better job of an inside view of Saudi Arabia through a westerner's eyes."
4,Saudi Arabia : A Confusing Place,"Saudi Arabia, a place of half hearted loyalties and a struggle for power John R. Bradley tells several intriguing stories of the power struggle between the Al Said royal family and the Wahabi clerics who have the willing ears of the masses. Particularly touching is the story of one of his students who on one hand befriends Bradley, than speaks of hating and wanting to kill Americans and only using Bradley to gain insights into the infidel American. This is the confusing and constrictive rope that men like Bradley walk, in one moment a friend, but in another moment an enemy crucified by a propaganda war that has consumed much of the Saudi lower class youth."
4,I agree with Enlightened...well...,"but I wouldn't give it a 5 star. Don't get me wrong, Ferry Corsten ABSOLUTELY IS my favorite musician. Just that I wouldn't call this piece ""Very Best""...Like The Enlightened One said, some of the tracks should have been left out such as ""Connected"" and ""Soul on Soul"". Personally I do not like these 2 tracks. Especially ""Connected"", it's horrible."
4,A little yellow...,"The powder is very light weight, which is nice, but it seems to change color the longer you have it on. It is fine and then ""poof"" you are miss orange face. Not cool."
5,A positive review,"Gene Kira's ""King of the Moon"" is one of the best fictional books on Baja to be published in my lifetime. The characters jump off the page to give you a vivid feel for the country and its people as they accept what the land and life gives them and struggle to make the best of what they are given. You will begin to understand why there are people like myself who have come to love the country and its stoic, warm-hearted people. For a real insight into Baja, try ""King of the Moon"".....Gary Graham, Baja on the Fly."
5,"Brilliant story, strong characters, great setting.","Like a fine cigar, KING OF THE MOON should be savored and enjoyed. This is a story you don't want to finish, yet you don't want to put down. The characters are alive and real. They invade your sole and live within you long after the read. It is a tale you will want to enjoy more than once."
2,disappointing,"This film on Merton is disappointing. They left out so much that was important, despite the fact that they had the courage to mention Merton's affair with Margie. You're better off getting the much older video ""Merton -- A Film Biography,"" which, although it doesn't mention the affair, gives a much more thorough overview of Merton's writings and life."
4,Metal's hot!,"This mug served its purpose, it was great. However, to keep my cocoa warm I left the filled mug on the firepit's grate. The metal trim on the lip of the mug -H-O-T! Use a straw after removing mug from grate."
1,NOT worthy of the Kaiser name,"I purchased these cutters to cut cookies for a culinary contest.I am sorry to say that these cutters failed by the 40th cookie. Well, 80 when you count the two cookies it takes to make one.The inner cutter worked loose and ejected with the cookie, rendering the cutter useless for its intended purpose-to produce large amounts of cookies assembly-line fashion.I had to stop, remove the inner cutter from the cookie, replace it in the main cutter and then procede to do the same thing for the next cookie.The only reason I continued was my need to have 10 exactly identical cookies to present on the competition platter.I would have taken them back for a refund, except I had lost the packaging. Not for the serious baker."
4,Not so easy to use cookie cutters,These cookie cutters function well enough. However reassembly after cleaning is more than a little challenging. They do cut and release dough well and the shapes will take you through several holidays.
3,Carefully note the size,"I would recommend this brush for large, flat surfaces like an RV or the hull of a boat. It is too large for a regular car (I have a Mazda5) and does not clean properly around the different curves and creases in the bodywork."
3,Ew!,"Like the other Avon makeup I bought, this turns your face orange. It doesn't even cover up any blemishes. What is the point of putting on makeup if all your flaws show through the orange glow?????"
2,Tight,The band size is off on this. I got the next size up and still could not get it around my rib cage with out it feeling like I could not breath.
2,"Cups are too big, cotton and no spandex, from 50's","I like the waist cinching, but the cups are horrible. Reminds me of a bra from the 50's. the cups are too big. I always buy size 38C and every bra I buy either fits perfect or too small. I've never had a bra fit so horribly. There is no stretchiness and no spandex. It is plain cotton and looks horrible if you are just slightly too big or slightly too small. there is no way that someone breasts are doing to look like oranges to fit perfectly in this bra to smooth out the material and not have lumpiness under your clothes."
2,Looks good but very uncomfortable,"First of all--this item seems to have not been sized correctly. I ordered my standard cup size, and it feels as it is 1 or 2 sizes too larger. Theres just a lot of empty space, which is not ideal. I also found that for a lot of my shirts, even ones that were not in anyway revealing, parts of the bra are visible, as it is extends to far up into your neckline.Second, the bra itself is really uncomfortable. The fabric is not soft, and rubs in all sorts of places. There are also bands on the straps that rub and get in the way.Strangely enough, despite all of these issues, I do like the way it looks under certain types of clothing. I do wear it occasionally, but as mentioned I feel it is generally uncomfortable. I would not buy it again."
2,Maddona Bra,I felt like Madonna in the 80s with this bra. Makes you chest bustier. as well as not flattering. must be thin to get it to fit properly
3,"Nice speakers, not so nice controls","Had I written a review soon after I got them, I would have given five stars. After having them for a few months, I'm experiencing some weird volume control problems. All of a sudden volume would go up and down. I've been able to consistently get this weird effect when I move the remote controller. If you're wondering where they could have cut costs to bring you such nice speakers, then you should take a look at the RC's dials. Compare them to the nicer speaker sets. Knowing what I know, I would but a slightly more expensive set of speakers."
4,This were great speakers,I loved these speakers. They were loud and the bass really boomed. It was because of these speakers that we quit using a separate stereo system all together. Hooked to our computer we had a much larger selection of music to chose from. I would be using these to this day if the volume control didn't quit working. Unfortunately without that piece the whole system is useless. They did last almost seven years though so it was money well spent.
2,not that good,"I am assuming that most of the people who gave this item a 5 star rating are either first time buyers or are completely deaf. I bought these to replace my old Microlab speakers which i got for less than half the price but were twice as good. the sound is ok but there are a few annonying problems that i did not expect from a product of this price range. first off, the bass is way to strong coming from the subwoofer and the midrange. second, there is no way of controlling the treble which is a big dissapointment cos if creative had included a treble adjustment knob i could have at least balanced out the sound quality a little bit and i probably would have given these a 3.5 instead of a 2"
1,Stop Working after a Year.,I thought it was good when it worked but then one day it stopped and never worked again. I try to call the Creative people but they were not help. So unless you just need it for a year don't buy it.
3,disappointed with the sound,"I bought these speakers since the $49 price was right. When I got them home I was disappointed with the sound. Would they do? ..yes ...but I took them back and decided to pay a little more to get better sound quality. Back at a different store (which let's you listen to their speakers), I found that the Altec Lansing vs4121 sounded very nice (I'll probably get them)."
5,"Excellent cookware, excellent price!","I purchased the 1.5 quart saucepan after receiving and using the 3 quart saucepan. I am totally impressed with the Infinite Circulon. The pans heat evenly, have no hot spots and nothing sticks. Even dried out, caked on food washes off quickly with very little effort. My sauces have never tasted so good, probably because they are cooking properly. After using cheepo pots most of my life, this is a serious upgrade. Longer cooking times are possible without meal damage, and the nice heavy lids seal in the flavor and juices pretty tightly. These pans heat quickly and stay hot for a while after the heat is removed. The handles are very stout and the styling works in my kitchen. When these aren't in use they are on proudly hanging on display on my pot rack."
2,Do not recommend!,"Very heavy! Lid is not glass so one has to lift it all the time to check on the progress of the cooking. Of course, this is my fault that I somehow did not noticed that before buying. Both lid and handle get so hot, even on the low heat, that I can feel through the mitt.Should return it, meant to then forgot and now it is too late!"
1,"Terrible film, terrible history","Dreadful film, too many historical inacuracies to even mention. Just dreadful. Pass it up and either read a good book or watch a decent documentary.My favorite part is when the German infantry are ""pulled back leaving the Artillery out in front"", or wait- maybe it was the fire hose flamethrowers, or no, the backwards west wall obstacles, or.. or..It has ONE good monent when they are walking in the woods- then they ruin it by having the guys stand around talking next to the front line foxholes. Oh the pain...."
3,History it's not.......,"While the Hurtgen Forest is a setting that could depict all the horrors of any war, this picture is not one that can be used to understand that place or that time. Apart from dramatic and telling scenes showing the unpredictable instantaneous effects of mines, there is little historical accuracy in setting.What was probably an attempt at depicting the Kall River crossing is off the mark."
2,Bad acting and contrived plot,"Compared to the best I have seen, i.e. SPR and Band of Brothers, this dog barks. The acting is atrocious and the plot so contrived it begs ridicule. And the guy that plays the Major should stick to country music and leave the acting to people a bit less wooden.I know the Hurtgen Forest was a horrendous episode in WWII but this film cannot possibly do the brave US Soldiers who actually fought there justice.Save your money, buy Band of Brothers or The Lost Battalion."
5,A realistically fresh view of WWII in Europe,"I felt this movie hit home for my father @ the age of 17 was part of the Keystone Regimate known as the bloody bucket and participated in this battle for the Hurgten forest. I compare this movie to the historical book ""Follow me into hell and die"" The movie depicts near real life scenes that may have occured during a battle that was of no strategic value to the war effort. Its an honor to those men on both sides. ."
4,What a Sleeper!!!,I bought this DVD on a lark and thoroughly enjoyed it. A very tough movie to watch but true to the grit that the director uses to frame the whole movie. I could have done without Dwight Yoakum grossly overplaying his part but the rest of the movie was terrific. Definately not a pro-war movie.
4,The Dark Battle,"The Hurtgen Forrest was probably the only stupid battle plan to come out of the ETO. There were other dumb plans, but this is the only stupid one. The history around the battle is worth reading up on before watching the movie.The movie is well cast, well acted and reasonably well filmed. The direction is good in all places, outstanding in others.Watch it and remember- they weren't fighting for Mom and apple pie- they were fighting for the guys in the trenches next to them, and to try, maybe succeed, to do an unwanted job."
3,The german point of view,"As my granddad fought in Hürttgen Forest on the german side (he was part of the Waffen-SS)I was very enthusiastic to watch this movie with him (he is now 79). He was very dissappointed because he told me that fighting bach then was much more surreal. The whole day and night thre was intesnse shelling and nobody knew really from where the shooting came. Fog and rain made the whole place to a scenery which seemed to come from another planet. He said he never understood why they wanted this bloody forest. They just had to wait with their 42 and gun them down. And they came again and again. Today you find this information table in Huerrten saying that 55 000 US-soldiers died there and sometimes when they build streets and building they still find human remains from both sides. To make it short: Grandpa gave it 3 stars for trying hard, but having been there he said it was just different"
3,Graphic Portrayal of a Significant WW11 Battle,"The movie portrayed a WWII battle (Huertgen Forest) that is often overshadowed in history by the Battle of the Bulge. The movie was violent and graphic and probably could not even come close to portraying what actually occurred. It did not provide much history of the battle, or the significance of the battle, but clearly delivered the message that the battle was costly. It was a war movie centered around the story of an individual who was a de facto leader with significant issues and a follower who blindly obeyed on the hopes of staying alive. There was a bit of irony at the end as it looked like a replay of the beginning, different characters same circumstances. It was a good movie that could have been much better with more development and a plot rather than just battle scenes and violence or at least some historical narrative on the significance and reason for the fight."
2,"Great story, bad acting and directing","I disagree with others raving about this movie.....there is a reason it is not shown on HBO anymore and that is because the acting literally stinks. The director did a horrible job with a great storyline and the characters come across as non-believable. The flame thrower scene when they attack the gun emplacement was literally ridiculous.....I had to shut the sound off because of the idiotic forced screaming the guy was doing. Over all I found this movie very hard to get into, I felt like I was on the outside rather than immersed in the storyline and I LOVE war movies. Once again, great story but a lousy portrayal."
3,Good Graphics but Explosions are Fake.,"This is one of few (if the only one) movies that depicted the Battle of Hurtgen Forest in 1944. There is not much action in this movie since it is centered around a G.I. Having been made by HBO, some might expect, as it is, the graphics are not top notch. This is no Saving Private Ryan. It is obvious in this film the explosion, being low grade as they are, are just fireworks. How ever the movie does present the brutality of war to the viewer. Pieces of people are recreated very well. This is a good movie to buy to keep the memory of the battle alive. Worth the price of under $10. An average rating for an average movie."
3,Trumpets,"Although I liked the movie overall, I think it could have been a little more ""historically correct."" Also, the ending was a let down."
2,Don't waste your time.,"I thought this was gonna be atleast half way entertaining but man was I wrong. Has no problem showing people lossing arms/legs and other body parts, but is not convecing when, it is infatry against infantry. On the whole it is not an entertaing movie much less one that gets your attention."
1,I doubt if my grandfather's generation acted like this movie,"Dwight Yoakum is in it I think, other than that, this is a poor movie overall. The battle in the forest I am sure, could have some redeeming qualities, but it doesn't show it too much. It seems like it is geared towards generation X with the soldiers wearing their hats backwards and the parts with the cigarette smoking to explicit to say here.One of the few movies that I have rented that I felt like turning off and watching was a chore and a bore.Private Ryan is an epic. This movie isn't as good as Hamburger Hill which I would give 4 stars. It isn't even as good as ""Tora, Tora, Tora."""
4,"LIKE ""SAVING PRIVATE RYAN"", A VERY MOVING FILM","AN EXCELLENT MOVIE THAT SHOWS HOW SOLDIERS IN WW II HAD LEADERSHIP ROLES THRUST UPON THEM OUT OF NECESSITY. IT IS NOT A FEEL GOOD MOVIE. THE MOVIE SHOWS THE TRUE NATURE OF THE AMERICAN SOLDIER IN THE EUROPEAN THEATER IN 1944. IT WAS COLD, SCARY AND THE SOLDIERS DIDN'T ENJOY BEING THERE,AS SOME EARLIER WWII MOVIES PORTRAY, BUT THEY STILL DID WHAT NEEDED TO BE DONE. LIKE ""SAVING PRIVATE RYAN"" IT GIVES YOU A WHOLE NEW APPRECIATION OF THE MEN THAT FOUGHT IN WWII..."
5,SUPERB,"John Irvin knows his way around a war movie. Had Irvin had Steven Speilburg's ""Saving Private Ryan"" budget, this would undoubtedly be the best war movie of all time. Well-scripted and taught, although some scenes appear a bit cheesy due to budget constraints. Ron Eldard gives an amazing performance as a war-weary GI who just wants to survive. Zak Orth also shines. Superb entertainment with so many cigarettes you'll develop lung cancer just watching. A brilliant film."
5,I love this movie!,I like the way this film shows the war. They show the terror of a flamethrower. I do not know why this movie did not make it big. This is the 2nd time i have bought it (last one got ruined).
4,Worth taking a look....if only for Ron Eldard's performance.,"I applaud Rod Eldard's performance and would have thought him suitable for HBO'S BOB, not to mention Private Ryan. Support performances weak on the whole I thought, no one else stood out. Subject matter grim but to the point. Considering the Hurtgen Forest Battle was largely overshadowed by The Bulge..am glad this film was made. What a horrible, inhospitable place. The DVD has a relatively short running time. Worth taking a look if only from an historical/educational point of view and Ron Eldard of course. Where was HE when Spielberg and Hanks were casting for BOB ????"
2,Another Ho-Hum WW-II Movie,"We purchased this movie thinking it would give insight to the famous Malmady Massacre that kicked off the Battle of the Bulge. It did show an interesting perspective of three soldiers cut off from American lines during the the bloody battle of the Hurtigen Forest, but not one to long be remembered."
2,War is not a happy Thing!!,"O.K. the movie was pretty bad. It disgraces all of the soldiers that fought and died together in the Hurtgen Forest.I thought this movie was O.K don't get me wrong but, It SICKENED me at the end when they played I'm dreaming of a White Christmas. PEOPLE DIED FOR US!! IT IS NOT A HAPPY THING SO DONT PLAY HAPPY MUSIC. ALMOST ALL OF THE SOLDIERS IN THIS BATTLE NEVER EVEN MADE IT HOME FOR CHRISTMAS!! THEY DIED SO WE CAN BE FREE! SO DONT TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT FREEDOM AND DONT PLAY HAPPY MUSIC IN A WAR MOVIE. ITS DISGRACEFUL AND SICKENING!!"
1,This is a Very Bad Movie,I had high hopes for this movie and I could not have been more disappointed. It had neither plot nor character development. The jokes were few and far between and most of them were mean-spirited jabs at Japanese culture. Bill Murray seemed to be either bored or just doing his lounge lizzard act during the movie. Even my wife though this was a pointless waste of time. Great idea that next left the batter's box.
4,"Good, just good!","The plot is a little sketchy, but those who give this movie a bad name because of it are just nuts.The movie is pretty good! Really good action scenes & good historical accuracy. It aint perfect like ""Saving Private Ryan"", but it's still something worth buying.Check it out & also check out ""The Lost Battalion""!"
4,completely accurate,"...The movie portrayed field manuvers very accurately. One of the first scenes in the movie showed a group patrolling in the woods, and it was almost exactly how the Army does it. The combat was also portrayed very well. Combat can be very confusing especially when the enemy opens fire on you unexpectedly. If one has not been trained as Ranger... he may not react so perfectly as the actors in the movies. These actors seem to know exactly where to turn and fire and they never seem to fear being shot...."
4,I thought there was going to be an HBO series!,"I thought the realism as far as blood and guts goes was top rate! Eldards role was a little bland but the supporting actors (not including yokum) were very good. I guess the budget did not cover extra germans but it got the point across. I thought when I saw the trailer it was going to be a hbo series like Combat! but now to my delight, there is going to be one that Tom Hanks has a hand in. Ive researched Hurtgen forest 44 and thought the writer and director did a fine job. The US army was approaching the breaking point and they got this point across, like it or not. Strangely the only thing that saved them was the outbreak of the battle of the bulge. Good, realistic movie."
4,Hurtgen Hell!,"This is a war movie I had seen once on t.v. a long time ago. It's a very good WWII tale of the lunacy of the battle in the Hurtgen Forest. The Army took horrendous casualties there, only to come to an end due to the ""Battle of the Bulge"" which would require these troops to hold the northern part of the Bulge. Graphic, but war is, so, put your rain coat on to keep from getting any blood on ya and watch it."
5,Superb!,"There is no shortage of war movies with tense inner themes, but this one is substantially above the average in that regard. I might not actually love it, but it's a darn good film."
3,Not user friendly,"When I received it, I felt that I would have to study the manual to figure out how to use it. It's not user friendly. It's lightweight. The size is perfect if you don't have a lot of room. The receipts look cheap. It's a cash register I would use at a garage sale or something where presentation is not important."
5,Marcel Desaulniers has done it again!,"CELEBRATE WITH CHOCOLATE is the latest addition to his collection of extraordinary, not-to-be-missed cookbooks for chocolate lovers everywhere. Is he a madman or a genius with chocolate? Probably both, but we don't care! 'Over the top' is the only way we want our chocolate! With recipes like Bob's Big-Ass Chocolate Brown Sugar and Bourbon Birthday Cake and Woozy Chocolate Brioche French Toast with Oozy Chocolate Maple Syrup, Marcel's characteristic sense of whimsy, detailed instructions, and decadent chocolate flavor shine through. This book is destined to become every chef's secret weapon when a spectacular Death by Chocolate finish is called for!--ANDREW DORNENBURG AND KAREN PAGE, James Beard Award-winning authors of BECOMING A CHEF, CULINARY ARTISTRY, DINING OUT and CHEF'S NIGHT OUT"
1,Worst Desserts Ever,"I made 3 different desserts from this book and all were terrible. Have since made several well over two hundred desserts from books by Nigella Lawson, Emily Luchetti, Gina DePalma, Alice Medrich, Kate Zuckerman and Claire Clark. All came out wonderful. Before I sell/donate this book I'm going to try one more go, but I'm not hopeful."
3,Arena rock from punks,"Interest in Duane Denison's angular guitar brilliance led me to this album. Surprisingly, it is far more poppy than any of his subsequent bands (the Jesus Lizard, Tomahawk, DK3, etc.). Sounds pretty good, with lots of space between the instruments, big drums, clear vocals. And that is actually it's failure. With harsher edges and more buried, smoggy sound, it would (counter-intuitively) be a more gripping album. Nothing at all wrong with the songwriting or the delivery, just incorrectly produced. Denison's guitar succeeds the most when it has to wrestle it's way out of a morass -- here it is crystalline and clinical.Atrocious cover art, too."
3,Making the same point over and over again,"This is not a bad ""state of the nation"" book, I've read much worse before. The central is idea of America held hostage by a sizable minority of affluent and content citizens and therefore blind for the plight of the less well-of is interesting, even thought-provoking. However, one good idea does not make a good book. These 180-odd pages ought to have been condensed in a 5 page article. Also, Galbraith uses this one idea to explain an astonishing variety of phenomena, which undermines its credibility. On the positive side, this book certainly contains some very poignant observations, written in Galbraith's typical witty, sometimes even sarcastic prose."
5,"""Don't leave home without it!""",You will never want to go to a nursing clinical withouth this book! I found the material to be easily understood and found exactly what I was looking for with it's excellent glossery and index. It is similiar to having a palm pilot in my hands! I was able to impress my instructors and my colleagues with information on diagnosis and labs. What an amazing book!
3,Games,"Although I got this to replace a specific game, there were many on these disc I think I would like. The game disc that I was replacing had gotten broken. Unfortunately, my computer is apparently too new for these games. The games seemed to load, but the computer said the games weren't there. The screen that did come up had several icons for buying more stuff, which I didn't like."
5,The Foundation!!!,"If you are new to hip hop music or just wanting a great hip hop compilation, this LP is highly recommended. These are essential artists/songs to check out. Especially, when ya have one of the illest DJ's mixin' & chopin' it up."
5,Speechless...,Jazzy by far is the best Turntablist by opinion...He is crisp with his cuts and his mixes flow like water. He is the turntablist Zen master...just great talent.
5,True Turntabling,Excellent comp from J the man who invented transformer scratching. As well as a first class line up the mixing in this is second to none. Never heard scrathing this mad on a CD.The man deserves twice as much acclaim compared to Will Smith as he isnt a sell out and keeps it real.By this CD and get educated!!!!
4,Serves its purpose,"I've needed the sound of a fan to sleep for the last 15 years or so. With that said, this one works perfect.It's not the quietest fan, but that's why I like it. When a fan was repeatedly rated a quiet fan I moved on. :)It pushes air well on low and even better on high.It could be a little smaller, but is a great utilitarian fan."
5,Sleep,"This is a great CD to fall asleep to,I enjoy popping it into the CD player with other Native American music or nature CD's at low volume and dozing off to a peaceful nights sleep :)"
1,Bad Copy.,"I bought this CD at target and when I got home to listen to it, a dialog boxes tells me all the files are damaged. Only 30 seconds of the first song plays and then the dialog boxes says it's damaged. I spent $10.00 for a 30 second song. Thanks. I'm sure the music would have been nice, but I'm very disappointed."
5,It really does work,"My wife and I have been trying to conceive for a while. When we saw an RE, I had my SA done. All my numbers were within average limits except for morphology. That was below normal. I asked the RE about improving morphology and he said to just eat a healthy diet, with plenty of antioxidants. After some searching, I decided to try the Fertility Blend for Men. After a few months of taking this, my SA has been redone and all my numbers are improved - including morphology. So it really does help.Just a couple of things to remember:1. Sperm take almost 3 months to mature. So you need to be on this product for 3 months to really judge it.2. Even good numbers don't guarantee a baby - but they help.I highly recommend this to any male who is trying to conceive. Even if your numbers are normal, they can still be improved which will improve your chances of success.Good luck on your journey!"
1,Extremely Disappointed!,"I ordered this and did watch the preview. The quality is horrible. The color is very dark and the camera shots are so shaky it is hard to see. It was just a mess of this and that at a bar-b-que party. I had just finished the series Swamp People and really liked it and wanted to see a bit more. This is more like the persons research video, very very poorly done. I really wish I could have my money back just on principle...this should not be sold."
3,Swamp Country,"Fairly good overview of life in the Louisiana Bayous. In particular the Pearl River Bayou.Too much emphasis on drinking and partying. Although these folks are tons of fun and love a good party, there is more to life down there than that.Not enough time devoted to how these fantastic people live from day to day, such as their homes, (I think their waterfront homes and houseboats are wonderful, and have a secret desire to move down there and live in one someday) their daily lives, how they earn their livings, and how they deal with the ups and downs of life on the bayous.Overall, not a bad DVD. Worth the price"
3,Good enough,"When I bought this DVD I thought I was going to sse more of the Bywatch girls, know more of them. Traci Bingham looks spectacular, but I think I have seen some scenes of this DVD on anothers. For example: I think I've seen the secenes of Erika eleniak in another video, the same happens to Jenny McCarthy. Sometimes Playboy includes images of another videos in brand new ones, are they trying so save money? I didn't like the sound and the image. Sorry. But if you want to see those girl out of their red swimsuits, go ahead, buy this one."
2,Ok film,"Just shows clips from the playmates' other videos. Shows a lot of Traci Bingham, but only really short clips of everyone else. Not really worth the money."
5,I NEED MOUTH 2 MOUTH!,"After this DVD you'll definitely need to be revived,sexy Traci Bingham guides you through scenes of BAYWATCH beauties like Pam Anderson,Donna D'Errico,Erika Eleniak and more baring all! This collection also includes the lovely Kelly Monaco one of my favorites,now some of the clips are collected from other Playboys vids but at least you don't have to buy a bunch of different DVDS just to see that certain clip.Carmen Electra is also on this DVD but she doesn't get naked,it shows her doing that clip she did for ""Playboy's Cheerleaders"" which is still a sexy scene and both that DVD and this one is out of print so if you find them-buy them, they're definitely a collector's item."
4,a little light for more than the average weightlifter.,"These bars are good for someone who doesn't plan to use much weight.The grip is narrow,which makes heavier weights feel uncomfortable.For the price,these are good.make sure you get plates with the right size holes."
4,Good Deal,"Great product for the price. Did a lot of shopping around online and this was the best offer. Overall, gets the job done. Grips are a little rough, but you will either calus, or I would recommend improvising some grips(I found that foam and electrical tape works nicely. I definitely recommend buying this item."
1,So bad quality!!!,These stuffs are beyond expectation but in the negative way. For the price I did not expect something this worst!!! Hollow bars indeed very hollow...
2,"Love all the songs, hate the quality of the CD","Favorite songwriter-love all the songs, but should have paid more attn to the fact that they were ""live"" recordings. Sound quality just not there for most of the songs and too much ""chatting"". Overall okay"
4,A pleasant slice of mature pop and classic Eagles songs,"This fine live album, recorded in Dublin, Ireland in the summer of 1992, contains superb versions of some of Glenn Frey's best solo material, as well as faithful renditions of several Eagles tunes.Frey performs live versions of ""Strange Weather"", ""The One You Love"" (which is one of the absolute highlights of the album), and ""Love In The 21st Century"" which surpass the studio originals. And his clear tenor voice is perfectly suited to soulful, R&B-infected songs like ""True Love"" and ""I've Got Mine"".Frey also does a charming ""Wild Mountain Thyme"" and a rocking ""The Heat Is On"", and plays raw slide guitar on ""Smuggler's Blues"". All in all, there is not a single weak track here, the band is smooth, and the saxophones are just lovely.And finally, Glenn Frey performs a beautiful lead vocal on ""Desperado"", which was originally sung by Don Henley, but which is co-composed by Frey.Smooth, wonderful adult pop/rock at its finest."
3,Sorta Eagly....,"This is another good but not essential live cd. The Eagles stuff is what most buyers will be looking for and it isn't bad although the Eagles renditions are generally far better. If you love the Eagles, I'd get one of their live albums instead of this"
2,Very Boring,It starts out on a very bad note with a very shortened and terrible version Peaceful Easy Feeling. Why shorten it?? And then they destroy Lyin' Eyes by making it a medley? Are you kidding me?? The rest is very generic - just get the studio versions and you are much better off. No excitement here.
3,a personal look at pebbles,This cd dosen't have the dance grooves of her 1st cd.It's has more ballads.It shows her growth as an artist.This cd should have been more popular than it was.It's a good cd wth great production.
5,Get On Top,Very Informative and the girls in the salon loved this book. Every single woman need this in her library as a tool to be successful at finding a good man.
1,Please tell me sisters have better sense that this!,"I read this book over four years ago. At the time, I thought it was funny, but I never took it seriously. I recently was clearing up junk from my apartment and came across it. I sat down to read the book to refresh my memory. I couldn't believe how awful this book was.While Righteous Mother made a couple of good points, it couldn't make up the overall failure of this book. It was laced with such racist untrue stereotypes about black and white men, that I was flabbergasted by her ignorance. Some theories she laid out she couldn't even defend with a coherent argument. I wonder if she wrote this book as a joke because some the advice was just too silly. If you follow this book to the letter as a guide to your relationships w/ black men, be forewarned, you're in trouble."
2,Bad Pictures,"I tried to use the camera to take pictures for a stop motion animation. But if you are not taking pictures with a massive light source behind you then it will be extremely dark for the lens. Any low lighting scenario will yield horrible pictures. I did not use the camera, I even gave it to my brother and he thinks its terrible as well."
5,Excellent camcorder for beginners,"I bought this kind of camcorder from Radio Shack about six years ago. It's not in good shape anymore, but it still records ok. This was my first-ever camcorder, and easily one of my favorite purchases in my life. I got one for occasional use when I was 12, and then a friend introduced me to Windows Movie Maker in Windows XP. Making videos has been my favorite hobby ever since (now with Adobe Premiere Elements), and I'm considering going to college for it.This is a cool camera, with all the features you need to get started making videos.You've got your pre-programmed white balance settings, as well as brightness settings and an SD card slot. Also, it records in the ASF format, which is widely compatible with software (but check first)."
4,Beats reading the spec,"This is the first book I have seen on BPEL - the business process execution language. A number of Web services orchestration / process tools are based on BPEL but hide the language behind a drag-and-drop GUI. I found that to effectively use these tools, though, you have to understand the concepts that make up BPEL - scopes, partner links, correlation sets etc. This book likely provides the best introduction to these concepts. Examples are given in ""raw"" BPEL as well as using Oracle BPEL Manager and Microsoft BizTalk.I wished for a little more in-depth coverage of advanced topics, such as correlation and convoys, but I think more people have to gain experience using these before we can expect a book to present ""best practices"".In summary, if you are interested specifically in BPEL, this is likely the book you want to get."
2,Good Intro to BPEL - Poor examples,"The book really did a good job about introducing the BPEL Spec..saves much of your time from Google. Beyond that, the examples using Oracle BPEL Engine are poorly written and too confusing. After the first 3 chapters, the book chapters stretches in different directions and I doubt the editors/authors did a final review together. The code examples are not working ! This means ..I regret to say 60% of book is not worth reading."
1,Trash,This album is fit for listening only if you are underv fifteen years of age. The sale of this noisy CD should never be coupled with another CD recording of classical music.
3,Everything Clint Eastwood,"I think when they made this movie, they were looking to the put Inspector Harry Callahan character in another movie. I've watched it before. It's okay. But then again, I love everything Eastwood and collect his movies."
1,Not worth reading.,My simple advice to anyone ever wanting to read any of this guy's books is not to do so. Otherwise you might end up in a mental hospital surrounded by the millions who have already read his books.
3,Good action film,"The action in this film is good, the story is ok. Not much to think about when it comes to plot and characters, but overall this is a ok film."
4,Debz thoughts,"The Fifth Commandment is ""Do not kill"". That is all they did in this fast moving action packed movie. It was fabulous."
2,I don't like it,"I don't like the movie.1. Its quite bad as far as the plot goes.2. The martial art scenes aren't all that great for someone who's watched the Jet Li, Donnei Yen or Tony Jha movies out there.3. The gun fighting scenes look like something out of the 80s, when all the villains chasing Sly line up in front of him so that he could shoot three with one bullet.You can see it on TV, or onlne, once, but owning it doesn't make sense."
5,it was great,Even my wife enjoyed it and that's saying something as she can be finicky now that we're both past 50.
2,Purchasing and Evaluating Airplanes,"While the book is interesting, ..... I have known many private pilots who have purchased small aircraft in much the same way they purchase used car, and never had any problems. Mr. Jacobson seems intent on creating a ""buyer beware paranoia"" for private plane purchasers by telling many ""good deals gone bad"" and ""horror stories"" about consumers buying their own planes without a professional appraisal and/or inspection. It almost seems this book is an advertisement for the airplane appraisers and inspectors more than anything. In summary, while this book has some interesting points, the author's perspective must not be forgotten, as he is in the business of making money off prospective buyers who have worries or concerns about their plane purchase."
4,Good read,"If you are in the market for your first airplane, this is a good and informative read. used it as a guide to buy my first."
3,Warning about the Kindle edition,"The kindle edition is riddled with typos and misspellings. I have only read up until page 202 but there are already so many mistakes that I want to give up reading.The mistakes really distract from the text; in one occurrence a brace ""}"" was inserted instead of a space in between two words. Repeatedly vowels are substituted for others in words (it instead of at, sock instead of sick, etc.)."
5,Every 20 something woman should read this book,"Years ago, I stumbled upon a first edition at a thrift store. I loved it and then gave it to a friend. I couldn't find a copy, till they reprinted it. This book is a treasure. It gives so much perspective in a no nonsense fun way."
2,Just slightly racist and snobbish,"I bought this book a while back, and still regret it. According to her, single women don't do housework, that's for the ""help"" (and in her book, that's ""colored help"", mind you) to do. The amount of work she has her ""help"" do would break the bank of most women today. Outdated, boorish, and snobby. Unless junior high was your favorite time in life, put this one back."
5,Handmade Photo Album,"I recently got married at the beach, and my husband and I wanted to put a nice, unique photo album together for his mom as a Christmas gift. I searched all the local retailers but found nothing. When I found this album I was thrilled! It was so reasonably priced and arrived promptly with no extra shipping costs. Now that we've put the photos in, I can't wait to give it to my mother in law!"
4,Will hold our memories for a long time,This was wonderfully made product and will hold our Hawaii vacation pictures. I am afraid that the star fish on the front may break though. Otherwise everything showed up as expected!
3,Touched by an Angel,I am extremly satisfied withmthis product. What makes it more special is that I know Chis Burke and Jason Kingsley thru my work.
5,Touched By An Angel Season 3,"Best TV Series ever made for Television. Need I say more? Oh yea, I give it a ""Celestial"" rating, 1 billion stars."
5,Touched by an Angel - The 3rd Season: Vol.1 and Vol. 2,"I have purchased The first, second, third and fourth season of Touched by an Angel.I enjoy watching the videos that a provide a glimpse of problems people are facing and sometimes when all seems lost, an Angel helps the person(s) realize that there is a way through prayer to make their life better.I hope that CBS will release additional seasons of Touched by an Angel since so many customers have expressed interest in purchasing Seasons 5 - 9."
3,Exaktor Overarm Blade Cover,"The EXOA-2 table saw overarm blad cover works okay. It is not the wonder tool I was hoping it would be and it would capture all of the sawdust. You need a lot of suction power to make it effective and then, it still lets some stuff out. It is nice in that it catches a lot of the dust and you don't have pieces constantly flying in your face. Assembly was a little tricky as their manual has some errors in it.I just wish that for the price they charge that it worked much better."
3,"5 for Safety, 2 For dust collection","I just set up my ""dream"" shop after years of dealing with marginal tools. Powermatic Table saw, Dust Gorilla central dust collection, Delta planer... one thing I wanted to improve on was the cleanliness of my shop. Since I had gone through all the trouble and expense of a 3 hp cyclone, and all the pipes and blast sates... I decided to go for the Exaktor to control the dust coming off the top of the saw blade. The new Powermatic has a good blade shroud... I just wanted as little dust as possible.Well, after installing and using the 2 new toys, I have to say that the Exaktor doesn't add much to the dust collection ability of my Powermatic 2000. I've tested with and without, and there is really no difference.Now, it is still a good blade guard. I will probably have all of my fingers and my eyesight because of it's help, so I'm not going to call it a waste of money... just not a big improvement in dust collection."
2,Bad out of the box,"Item had some bent parts shipped in the box - no apparent damage on the outside from shipping, I assume the parts were bent when packed for shipment from the factory - shoddy. With some modifications to the bent parts got it together and it kind of works. Setup is a pain - especially bad is the shield part that has a metal frame with plastic pieces. Seems as if it could have been designed with just poly parts. The metal reduces visibility to the blade. Wheel does not really do anything, don't get taken in by that feature.I called customer service at exaktor to get a replacement for the bent part two months ago at which time they said they would send out a replacement. Have seen nothing yet.Wish I had not bought it. Avoid if you can."
3,Great product with some modifications,"I thought this would be an excellent stylish way for me to carry my baby around. stylish it is, but, my newborn often looks squished inside the shell, and the shell can hurt my back at times. Neither one of us can seem to get comfortable. One thing I think that could improve the product is spandex throughout to make the entire shell stretch. I think maybe I will be looking forward to when my baby gets older, and we can try the other positions."
4,KHL REVIEW,"Bought this system on and budget lloking not spend more than 150 , for the price its actually quite loud and now that got and reciever that can pump out 5.1 digatl its amazingly loude but looking for system that makes neibors house rattle you might wany spend more dough but this sytem wakes my parents up and have only at 50% of the power. but be warned dont buy this unless you have and reciver or plan or getting one!"
4,A lot of music for a very decent price,"I'm no beginner to reggae but found this compilation when searching for Lopez Walker's 'Trial Days'. This was the only place to find it and well worth the purchase price alone. Disc 1, the roots disc, is the strongest of the 3. I later discovered that many of these tracks are the ones played on the internet reggae playlists you find on radio stations linked to in iTunes. Shuffle these 3 discs and you've got many afternoons worth of good music with neither commercials nor banter. Well worth the ticket!"
3,Good info.,"Everything you'll need to know about performance tuning on four-stroke engines. Exhaust, intake, combustion, everything is covered. Good buy if you are looking to learn more."
5,A must Have,as a aircraft mechanic and a car enthusiast this book is a must have... cant go wrong wit all the formulas and old skool trick of the trade thats in this book
2,Hated it.,"I guess i'm one of the only people who did NOT like this book. I got about 30 pages into it before I decided to take it back. It's neither clear nor concise and some of the ""recipes"" that were provided didn't even work. (And yes, I followed them step by step to the letter.)"
3,Looked at in a store & didn't buy,"I am allergic to milk and am always on the lookout for new cookbooks. I spent some time looking through this one in a kitchen store recently and decided not to buy, mainly because of the use of non-dairy cheese in many recipes. Yes, these cheeses are good for the lactose-intolerant, but they are not good for anyone allergic to milk. All of the good ones contain casein, a protein in milk that is often the cause of allergic reaction. There are truly milk-free cheeses out there, but they do not tend to melt well, and, therefore, often can't be used successfully in cooking.I'm disappointed that someone who writes a book like this would title it ""Totally Dairy-free"" when it's not. ""Non-dairy"" or ""Lactose-free"" would be more appropriate.That said, it was a nicely presented book and had some recipes that looked really good."
3,NOT totally dairy-free,"I asked for this book after seeing it on Amazon and was sorely disappointed when I got it. As we say in Texas, all hat, no cattle. I am allergic to casein and can't eat half the stuff in it. It looks great, but the title is *totally* misleading. I've gotten more mileage out of Beth Kidder's ""Milk-Free Kitchen"" and a nutritionist's ""Lactose-Free Cooking."" If it were truthfully titled, I probably would have been more favorably impressed."
1,should be the totally soy cookbook,"The author doesn't realize that lactose free and dairy free are NOT synonomous. A lot of the recipes include soy cheese which has milk proteins in it. A lot of the recipes have a lot of soy in them - miso, tofu, etc. I'm not a fan of soy and my son is allergic to milk protein, so this book was useless. It also is very fancy, restaurant recipes; so I wouldn't probably make them anyway."
5,Incredible book!!!,"I bought this book almost 2 years ago, and I cannot get enough of Louis' recipes!!! It is so obvious, to me, that each one took a lot of time and tasting in development!! Every time I want to knock someone's socks off with a dairy free recipe, I make something from this cookbook. Louis Lanza is truly a genius!!!Last week I tried the Pumpkin seed, Basil, and Miso Pesto for the first time...UNBELIEVABLE!!!"
2,Not As Hoped,I was so happy with the Skillstreaming Teacher manual and the Lesson Plan books that I assumed the student manual would be as useful. It turned out to be redundant and not useful at all. I feel I wasted my money ordering it.
4,Open Sesame Pictury Dictionary,Other teachers and I love this book! It has helped many students transition from Spanish to English with friendly characters that they love. I would recommend this to anyone helping a student find the words to express their knowledge!
1,misleading,"The product description clearly says quilt.Picture shows a quilt. Product is not a quilt but curtains. When seller was called they blamed Amazon. Amazon blames seller. But nobody has the quilt. Just as well after reading the reviews aboutChloe Panels, pr. 84""W x 84""Lthe seller. I got away lucky. I got something."
4,Relato poético de la gesta española en la Conquista de Chile,"Alonso de Ercilla y Zúñiga, poeta español, salió desde el Perú acompañando a las huestes del conquistador español Capitán Pedro de Valdivia en la campaña a Chile (Mediados del siglo XVI) y vivenció la larga lucha que éstos sostuvieron con los nativos del territorio recién conquistado, los araucanos, que jamás se rindieron ante el español que a sangre y fuego trató de someterlos. Además describe en hermosas estrofas cómo era la nueva tierra que conquistaba para la corona española."
4,A good one stop read,"I have used this book as an ethics instructor for six years. The book is useful in identifying the multiple influences upon our lives for how we make ethical decisions. Our religious perspectives and understanding of behavioral sciences find residence in our lives, whether we are aware or not. It is through these we are formed and make decisions. Stevenson and Haberman present overviews of Taoism, Hinduism, and Judaism, as well as behavorial sciences and philosophy by examining these theories' underlying philosophies and intellectual difficulties. While Judaism and Christianity are not separated by chapter [but combined into one], and Islam is not given a full discussion, the book is useful for understanding the complexity of global interaction and how we can relate to the millions of people who hold religious or philosophical premises unlike our own."
5,Great introductory book,I like the way the author analyzes the religions and thoughts that have influenced the course of world history. It doesn't compare one against the other so the reader is allowed to view the theory in a vacuum. I only wished that the author wrote a chapter on the importance of why we need to engage in such an endeavor that would set the trajectory of our lives. Great book!!!
4,A threshold to understand human nature,"The authors attempt to compress 9 philosophers' senses of human nature into a small book. These 9 philosophers are Karl Marx, Sigmund Freud, Jean Paul Sartre, B.F. Skinner, and Konrad Lorenz, Confucius, Hinduism and Kant. In hope of making the comparison among these philosophers to be clear, the authors examine each theory in terms of nature of universe, nature of humanity, ills of the world, and proposed solution to cure the world. In short, this book should be an excellent threshold for a person who wants to approach human nature"
4,Ten Theories of Human Nature,Interesting read for my son. He is impressed with the book. This is a school requirement for him. He learnt of different theories.
2,Annoying chatty tone ruins good survey,"The author's notes at the beginning explain that the content of the book comes from Stevenson's first year mandatory class at a university in Scotland. Unfortunately, it was not really repackaged for a more general and sophisticated audience. So there's a lot of space wasted with reminders that, for example, Greek society was very different from ours or that we shouldn't dismiss Marx because of Lenin and Stalin. There are also annoying chatty asides, that feel like the kind of lecture tool required to grab the attention of uninterested first years. Despite all this, it's a useful survey with some good introductory information, it's just a bit painful to read.Additionally, it seems that Stevenson's Christian background completely muddles that chapter and infects the rest of the book.The two Haberman chapters are actually quite good."
2,"Not the greatest, but not the worst either.","This book is ok if you are using it to review for the test after having used another more in-depth book (sybex or the like). If you have a pretty good understanding of how networking is done you may be able to pass the test with just this book. If you don't work on a network allready, get one of the other MCSE books that more closely resemble a phone book."
2,Disappointing-There are better review books...(Nutshell),"I was disappointed in this book. The book left out important details that will be on the exam, had an above average number of errors, poor questions, and surprisingly, included a lot of needless information that won't be on the exam. For example, the troubleshooting chapter had very general, obvious, tips rather than recommending a certain cable tester for a sample situation, which is what will be on the test, or what is the problem if a DVM gives a certain reading? Another example, the 5 Microsoft troubleshooting steps should be listed, rather than just mentioned in one paragraph. I could go on...I would recommend the IDG books for main study and the ""Nutshell"" (Which do have the info you'll need in a concise format) books for review. The Microsoft Exam Readiness books are also good for practice questions. Maybe the other Exam Cram books are better..."
2,not for beginners,"Maybe the problem is simply that the book is mislabelled -- it says it is for beginners or intermediate.All I can say is, it is way too hard for beginners. Maybe it is good for intermediate, but I'm not in a position to know.If you are looking for a good start for a beginner, 'Getting by in Turkish' is a really easy way to pick up a few words and phrases that you can use right away."
4,Very Good,These are great movies for the whole family. From the day after Thanksgiving to the day after Christmas my husband and I watch holiday movies. So I'm always looking for new movies. I would recommend these to anyone.
5,Excellent!,"In my opinion, the score to this film is superior to the film itself. It's the only motion picture score that truly captures the sweet melancholy of the Fall. Try listening to it with headphones and you'll hear a highly dimensional sound, delicate and subtle. Reflective and spiritual. Just close your eyes and you'll feel the brisk autumn wind against your face, you'll see orange and brown leaves falling from the trees, and you'll hear the sounds of children carving jack o'lanterns. It's a short score, but truly excellent."
3,War and Remembrance V. 1,"In contrast to The Winds of War, this film focused on the travesty of the holocaust. While probably acccurate, it was a very dark movie."
3,Sequels,"As with most sequels, this as well as parts 8 - 12 are not nearly as good as was the Winds of War. At the same time, if you like continuity in a story and want to see the heroes and the heroines as they make it through the hard times they were left in at the commencement of the war, you will want to see this too. There are character changes. Jane Seymour replaces Ali McGraw (Natalie), Hart Bochner replaces Jan Michael Vincent (Byron). Ben Murphy is replaced by Michael Woods (Warren). Lisa Eilbacher was replaced by Leslie Hope (Madeline Henry). John Gilgood replaced John Houseman (Aaron). Sharon Stone also replace Deborah Winters (Janice), Robert Morley replaced Michael Logan (Alistair Tudsbury) and the Hitler character became far more dramatic by Steven Berkoff replacing Günter Meisner. These replacements did not detract from the movie and perhaps helped in most instances but I did miss Lisa Eilbacher as Madeline and I preferred Deborah Winters in her role as Janice Henry."
3,Family Drama,"Moving, historically correct, valuable because it narrates the history of World War Two in the form of a family drama."
5,Superb WWII epic,"There is just no other mini-series that has moved me like this one. I honestly didn't think that Dan Moore could come close to topping ""The Winds of War"" but this is a superbly written and directed story. This would be a fantastic epic to show high schoolers how WWII affected so many across oceans and across cultural lines."
3,War and Remembrance,"I have watched only the first disk but the clarity is disappointing. The ""Winds of War"" disks were better."
2,"Very very short, and available FREE online","Be forewarned, this ""book"" is only 18 pages long (not counting the title page, etc.) And the biographical sketch and interview with Lerner -- half of the 18 pages -- are both pretty forgetable.The heart of the ""book"" consists of study guides to the first three ""Dance"" books: ""Dance of Anger"", ""Dance of Intimacy"", and ""Dance of Deception"". They're well done, but only 2 pages each.There's also 2 pages of helpful advice for starting a discussion group based on one or more of the ""Dance"" books.P.S. Shortly after I wrote the above, I discovered that the author's Web site (www.harrietlerner.com) has a free comprehensive set of Reader's Guides to all of the ""Dance"" books, including everything in this title.I rate this five stars for content, three stars for how short it is, and 1 star for the idea of paying for it."
1,little,"This product does not come with all the pieces that are shown in the picture. It also comes in pieces, that you have to put together and the glue does not come with it. Once its put together it does not stand on its own. It is very SMALL. This product is a waste of $5.00."
2,Brick wall,This product was a little small for playing outside in a pile of sand. It's hard to see. Wouldn't recommend for a child under 8 or 9.
5,President Grant's attempt to bring our red brothers together,This book explains how President Grant tried to form Peace with the IndiansHe deserves more praise than he gets.
3,"Scary concept, but poor writing","Not being a Robin Cook fan, this book attracted me with its scary premise of tinkering with human evolution. The book starts out great, but one dimensional characters and telegraphing of the outcome ruined the story about one thrird in. Cook has neat ideas, but his writing snd plot skills are weak. I just couldn't suspend my disbelief of the stupidity of some characters and the introduction of plot twists, particularly including the crime world."
2,"Slow, but readable","Nowhere near his classics of Coma and Sphinx. If you are looking for a book for a long transcontinental flight, this is not it, it will not keep you reading on and on. You will come back to it though, if not for anything else then just to find out what the end will be, which in it self is not that great either."
2,Disappointed with this one,"This book was just OK. Not as good as some of his other ones. The ending left you hanging, and the book was pretty boring during the middle portion."
3,What happened to the ending?,"I really enjoyed reading this book, and was all set for a great ending, but no such luck. The book just stops. It wraps up in about 1 1/2 pages. Very disappointing! What happened to all of the other characters in the story? What happened to the operation in Africa? What happened to our gangsters?"
3,Tasty but not filling,"A decent detective/adventure yarn, but it fails to wrap up/ give resolution to all the characters at the end. The final fate of half the protagonists is ignored at the end, as well as all of the fate of all of the villians. Is there to be a sequel? I think it might better be wrapped up in one extra chapter. Give us a break Doc, where's the rest of the story."
4,Robin Cook the master of medical thrillers,"Chromosome 6 is a very good book, you never get bored.There are a lot of action and suspense.The story is about the clonage , and that show what the clonage can do, some human-animal, that make thinking.The book speaks about what past now.It's sometimes hard to understand because there are a lot of the medical terminology.and about a medical examiner named Jack Stapleton who discovers at the morgue in New York City while working that something strange is going on. He notices during an autopsy that a man had had a liver transplant but for some reason he has trouble finding out where and when and also the man didn't need anti - immunity drugs, in other words the body did not try to reject the liver. Jack digs deep to find the answer and the two plots finally connect.I very enjoyed it!"
3,Books need ratings like movies,"Whether you like the ending of this book or not, the actual idea and concept presented in this book are very interesting! I found the book entertaining as well as educational, I learned a lot about the medical field, from management down to molecular biology! However, I was very dissapointed in Cook's use of language. Profanity is just not necessary, we hear enough of that in movies and on television. Also, he uses the name of Jesus Christ irreverently (similar to what you hear in movies or on TV). If people are shocked by something they don't need to blurt out the Lord's name. ... This book had no sex ""scenes"", for which I was grateful. ..."
1,"Boring, dull, and poorly written, just another book","From the beggining till the end, this book is a boring and monotone manuscript. The tale is way too ficcional, making it hard to believe, therefore making it another Robin Cook book. It is a poorly written attemp on what could have been a story with some potential, but the author makes it a ""I wanna get over with this as soon as possible book"" adding gratuit accion, and chracaters that seem to come straight out of ""Bored land""It is all in all, just another book written by just another author of NorthAmerican bestsellers."
5,The missing link has surfaced.,"When I read this book I was really into the missing link of our evolution. While reading this novel, my interest in the missing link grew to be enormous. A master of entrancement, Robin Cook, one of the great ones."
2,Airplane read,"A jargon filled book that has interesting twists. Certainly for the Cook fans. PC certainly, with a strong anti corporate/science theme. Insulting to the professional. On vacation? Take it along.A personal note; my son would be alive today, if we had decent transplant technology."
3,Ending Please!!!!!,"I must say I enjoyed Cook's books (heehee it rhymes) however, Cook leaves too much to the imagination. After reading the ending I wonder where the rest is. Strange because Cook is very detailed throuought the book."
4,Chromosome 6 was an extreamly good book But too confusing.,Chromosome 6 was the type of book I'd like to read but it had too many characters and if you read chromosome 6 before contagion you don't really know what the main character's history is. It was a good book.
3,Some one forgot to put an ending on this book!!,Chromosome 6 was a very face pace read. The intensity was very well wriiten. I wish Cook would do shorter chapters. In the 90's it makes it easier to put the book down and then come back to it. The book has it's Cook typical characters - those who have a very high degree of scientific background but seem unable to see beyond their own eyes. The reader figures out the plot before the characters every get around to it. I would have rated the book higher but the ending left me in a lurch. Three of the best characters suddenly disappear at the end with no trace or mention in the text. Also both bad guys are left still in Africa. The only thing that we know is that our two heroes make it back home. Where is the rest of the book?
4,Student Book Review,"This was a replacement for a book that my daughter lost. It arrived in great shape and provided her the information she needed for her report. However, I paid for overnight delivery and did not receive the book for almost six days."
5,One of Cook's Best!!!,"This is one of my favorite Robin Cook books. This rather prophetically scary story weaves together genetic engineering and cloning in humans and primates. Given rapid advances in modern technology, a story like this not only could come true any day, but do we really have any idea whether something like this is actually happening, without general public knowledge of it??? Think about it."
3,Great Story; Not Well Written...,"The premise for this story is great. The story development is average. However, the writing leaves a lot to be desired.Clever story has all the twists and turns that make for great suspense. Love the way the writer approaches the science involved.However, the development seems a bit forced. In fact, the great pains gone to in explaining plot turns only seem to highlight their departure from reality. Don't tell me; show me...Finally, poor word choice had me scratching my head. It almost seemed as if the writer was attempting to impress the reader with his vocabulary, while failing to realize that his words didn't fit the situation, the character, or the way people speak or think...Abrupt/hurried ending a real disappointment..."
2,cardboard science,"this novel has a very good premise -- guinea pigs (or in this case, bonobos) starting to evolve as humans. but the book is peopled by cardboard characters, starting from the protagonists -- kevin, jack, laurie; down to the antagonists -- raymond, the mafiosios; these people are so illogical. especially raymond who kept asking the help of the mob boss to solve his problems and in so doing just keep on complicating his problems. kevin on the other hand is such a wimp to be one of the main protagonists. i didn't not empathize with him at all. i was praying that he got caught and killed in the process.this could have been another jurassic park in terms of its premise but it failed due to the characters."
3,"Ok, It Wasn't his best, but it's another of his scary ideas","This wasn't the best Robin Cook I've ever read, it wasn't even the best Robin Cook with Jack and Laurie as main characters. But it did keep me flipping the pages to get to the climax. Unfortunately the ending seemed a bit contrived and the non-New York characters were poorly developed. I didn't notice so much with the characters from the medical examiner's office in New York because most of them have been in other Cook novels I've read.Still and all the premise of the book was enough to keep me reading. I was not totally comfortable with transgenic technology before I read the book, now I'm even less comfortable."
2,An unexpected ending (sooner than expected),"The story is based on a great premise, but the writing is unbalanced. It takes a great amount of time to set the stage, then everything ends very abruptly. It's almost as if someone said ""Pencils down!"""
2,Maybe I read an abridged edition,I didn't prefer this book. I thought it left some areas un answered and unclear. It was not as well written as is many other books. Though I may have read an abridged edition.
1,"Good Idea, Terrible Writing","The idea for this book was clever, but it had some of the worst dialogue I've ever read. All the characters spoke like an article in a medical journal, not realistic at all, with the exception of Black characters, who threw in an occasional ""Hey man"" or ""You know what I'm sayin"". That brings me to another problem with the book: it was stereotypical. The evil German villian with the scar, the Italian mobsters, etc. Most people's reviews say they were let down at the end, but for me, I was just happy it was over( I had to read it for school)."
3,Cook Falls Short,"This book deals with the question of cloning and gene splicing. In Africa, a certain species of monkeys are being mutated. After the mutations are completed the organs from the mokeys are then transplanted to people who need them.Cook I felt had a good plot but did not go into enough detail about what happened afterwards. He has lots of scientific explanations to back up his work but the story is predictable and lacks the amount of action I enjoy. This is the second Cook book I've read and they both have fallen short of what I expected to get out of them, the other was ""Abduction""."
3,"Pretty Good, but could have been brought to a higher level","+AH4-The book kept my interest all the way to the end, because Iwanted to know how it was going to end. The plot was great, but I thought he did use all of it's potential. This book had hardly any suspense and had no mystery effects on the reader at all except how was it going to end. I guess I was hopeing for him to put Island of Dr. Monroe effect in! The ending was like everybody else says abrupt and could have had more effort into it. Overall I give this book 3 stars, because it was+AH4-+AH4- entertaing at some times. And it was mostly a clean book. Not that much foul language or bad content, which I enjoy as a reader. I don't like to read trash! This book should be read on a cold winter day when there's not much to d+AH4-"
5,"Excellent read, best he has written!","I have read many of Cook's books, including Mutation, Outbreak, Coma, and others, and I really enjoyed all of them. The medical technology was very interesting, and the characters were excellent. In Chromosome 6 though, the characters were really given a chance to develop. The different characters were separated at the beginning of the book, but all came together slowly as the book progressed. I would recommend this book to anyone!"
3,"Slow, mediocre and predictable","Not one of Robin Cook's best, it was slow to develop and predictable. I finished it just to find out how it would end."
4,Cook holds his readers until the end....Unfinished?,"I am and always will be a Cook fan. I loved Contagion and was thrilled to find the sequal Chromosome 6, until I got to the Epilogue and discovered three of the main characters were left in limbo. Does this mean another sequal? What happened to Kevin, Candace and Melanie....I have been searching the web looking for a Cook site to register a complaint. As an author myself, I cannot fathom such an oversite."
2,decent story - unfinished/ disappointing ending,"The story is a good read, but it seems Cook was in a hurry to finish the book. The ending seems unappropriately unfinished. The ending is self explanitory, but there are too many story lines in the book are left hanging in the end. I guess it is more important to get a book on the shelves quickly, than to wait and get a GOOD book on the shelves that will keep a reader coming back for more."
2,That's it????,"This was such a page-turner and the story-line is so true-to-life that it's almost scary. However, just as I was thinking ""this a GREAT BOOK"", the author abandons the story. There was no resolution to the action packed body. It almost felt like he had reached the maximum page limit and just stopped there. It's not a cliffhanger, just a solid brick wall.Thumbs down"
4,Chromosome 6,To start with this is the first book I've ever read in the past 15 years. Those who love forensics and medical experimentation will surely love this book. In general you don't need to be a medical expert to be able to follow thesense of the story with all it's medical terms here and there. I am not a medical expert at all. The only thing which I have to criticise is that at times there are so many characters thrown in the story all at once that you start to lose count of who is who. Apart from that the novel is very well presented.
2,A strangely written story...,"I had a hard time keeping up with the plot of ""Chromosome 6."" This story about biotech experimentation mingled with the mafia seems to drag on and on in places with sub-plots that have no impact or meaning in the end. Robin Cook spends a lot of time in the story developing certain characters that again have no significance in the ""big picture."" He also teases the readers with the possibility of romance and relationships between two sets of heros/heroines, but never delivers. Toward the last 50 - 75 pages, the story really picks up and promises a ""bang"" of an ending, but the final pages fizzle out if you ask me. I was disappointed; Robin Cook is capable of much better work."
3,A good story but a little rushed perhaps?,"This book starts out brilliantly, a mysterious death linked somehow to an animal research facility in Africa. Forensic pathologist Jack Stapleton begins to investigate - and someone doesn't like it.The story has a lot of suspense and, as always, is medically fascinating without bogging the reader down. However, about two-thirds of the way through the book, the story seems to gain speed, almost leaping to a conclusion that left this ready feeling a little let-down and wondering why it felt as though Mr. Cook has rushed it. Nonetheless, if you're a Robin Cook fan, read the book. If you're thinking of trying a Robin Cook story, try another one (may I suggest ""Contagion"") because this one may not be the one that hooks you."
2,Too many loose ends!,"First of all, the scientific terminology was very difficult, unless you are a docter and since Cook wrote the book for common readers, that was a mistake on his part. Second, the book ended rather abrubtly... and too many loose ends were unsolved. The more Cook writes, the worst his novels are getting. Maybe he should stick to medical practice instead."
2,So so at best,"I'll skip my disappointment in the ending. Obviously, I am not alone. I was more disappointed in the lack of character development. I never felt I knew the characters. After reading cover to cover I don't know anything about any of the odd-ball characters."
1,1-Dimensional Writing,"I was very disappointed with this novel. I have heard from so many people that Robin Cook writes such good medical thrillers. So decided to read this book as part of my research into how society and literature depicts geneic engineering in animal species. This was definately the worst book of the many that I read. The plot was unbelievably bad, the characters were underdeveloped and the ""bad guys"" horribly sterotypic. Additionally the characters behaved in ways that were senseless. There are many other books that deal with this subject/premise. I felt as if I wasted my time with this one.I recommend Sims by F. Paul Wilson or Dark Inheritance by W. Michael Gear and Kathleen O'Neal Gear. Both have more believable characters and offer much more suspense."
2,Not Robin Cook's Best,"The premise of this book was most intriguing but the character development was poor. The main character seemed almost like a rehash of characters found in previous novels by Cook. The scientific details were fascinating and obviously a lot of research went into these details. The geographic descriptions were also quite vivid but the ending was most abrupt and extremely poorly written. This could either be the fault of the author who lost interest by the last chapter or else the editor was overzealous and did a hatchet job on it. Either way, it was most disappointing. If you feel a need to read it, buy a used copy."
4,medical suspence with a twisting plot,"very good book from several view points, many smaller stories come together at once with a climatic ending."
3,"Good start. Great middle. Abrupt, weak ending.","The threads of the two separate setting came magically together by the middle of the story. Great science fiction genre style of writing, with a glossary included, for those less savvy in dealing with DNA and its future scientific possibilities. The characters were extremely flat..some were mentioned just in passing...no depth of emotion or humanity about them. Most dialog amounted to just passing banter, or trite lines. Over-contrived plot with a very implausible, fractured story line. The novel did build to a cresendo .but fell flat. Much more was expected after the set of main characters from NY and Africa finally met. Robin Cook really dropped the ball in the end. So many unanswered questions. This could have been a major thriller of the highest order. But......it was as if Cook was under a deadline.....and just ""ended"" the book."
3,Good but without carefully planned out ending.,This book is in the same line as all of the other books written by R.C. It can be too technical for those that are not medically informed. The ending of the book was not well thought out and abruptly ended as if he didn't know what else to write about. The book mildly kept my interest.
2,SLOW,"I am a Robin Cook fan. But - - - This story started out slow and didn't pick up any speed. I got bored and put it down once, and had to pick it back up later and start over. It was work. The plot doesn't seem to have focus. Too many elements: Mafia, prehisoric man, cloning, transplant manufacturing, greedy doctors, etc."
1,BORING,"This is the first and last Robin Cook book I read. The dialogue was stiff and unrealistic, especially that of the African-American characters. The stereotypical Mafia members (ie Vinnie, Angelo) were ridiculous and did not fit in well with the story. The only reason I did not put the book down halfway through was because I was hoping for a shocking ending to make it worth my while. I was extremely disappointed. After finishing I found myself saying ""that's it?&quot"
4,A very good read with some strong moral implications!,"This book was a very interesting foray into the moral and ethical issues of modern scientific technology. Where do we draw the line for transplant experimentation and genetic engineering?The book offers continuity in it's characterizations for those who read Contagion, by ""resurrecting"" Jack, Laurie, and Lou, and provides for suspenseful action while on the Island because we care about these characters.A thoughtful insight into what mores society has to contemplate in the not too distant future"
2,THE BOOK IS BORING.THE DIALOGUE IS STILTED.NOT REALISTIC,"I TRIED TO ENJOY HIS STORY. BUT TO INCORPORATE THE MAFIA AND MODERN SCIENCE, WITH MORONIC DOCTORS AND SCIENTISTS WHO HAVE LITTLE ELSE TO SAY BESIDES ""I HOPE THIS DOESN'T AFFECT MY STOCK OPTIONS,"" OR ""YOU'LL GET RICH FROM THIS VENTURE,"" IS TOO MUCH TO ENDURE. PLUS CREATING CAVEMEN?--COME ON.LET US SEE THESE AUTHORS CREAT REALISTIC THRILLERS, WITH DECENT DIALOGUES, INTELLIGENT CHARACTERS AND A GOOD STORY. THIS MAKES ME WANT TO THROW AWAY ALL COPIES INEXISTENC"
3,To Much Sci-Fi,"This is the first book written by Cook that I haveread and although I enjoyed it, I found the ending tobe extremely disappointing. Cook is right on the moneyincorporating new medical breakthroughs and the ethicaland moral issues concerning their practical use, buthe goes too far making the ending unbelievable andtoo science fiction for my liking. Bringing allof the characters together for the final chapters ofthe book seemed contrived, and his mob characters wereunimaginative. Otherwise, this is a quick read andrelatively enjoyable."
3,You Call That an Ending?,Chromosome 6 was a very face pace read. The intensity was very well wriiten. I wish Cook would do shorter chapters. In the 90's it makes it easier to put the book down and then come back to it. The book has it's Cook typical characters - those who have a very high degree of scientific background but seem unable to see beyond their own eyes. The reader figures out the plot before the characters every get around to it. I would have rated the book higher but the ending left me in a lurch. Three of the best characters suddenly disappear at the end with no trace or mention in the text. Also both bad guys are left still in Africa. The only thing that we know is that our two heroes make it back home. Where is the rest of the book?
4,"Interesting, Puzzling and fast moving","It is a little more ""outdoor"" plot. Usually Dr. Cook's books doesn't take you to different parts of the World. But this one does travel back and forth between US and Africa. The only thing that I thought that was interesting was the fact that the main character was getting the clues to solve the puzzle out of the blue. The Author could have been little more careful there, but that is the way it goes in lot of books."
2,Help!,I had such high hopes for Robin Cook. The premise and story line of the book are quite promising but I was very disappointed in the two-dimensional characterizations of the characters in Africa. The development of the New York-based characters was better. Can anyone recommend a Robin Cook book with more life-like characters?
2,Mildly entertaining at times but mostly flat and lifeless.,"Cook has definately NOT outdone himself this time. The story line is rather unsuspenseful and predictable and the main characters are not completely believable. Chromosome 6 is a dissapointment when compared with Coma, Brain, and Acceptable Risk."
3,Concentration Faded,"A New York gangland member is killed, so what does this have to do with liver transplants, bonobos and protohumans? Forensic pathologists Jack Stapleton and Laurie Montgomery head to Equatorial Guinea to find out. It's a very long read, and my concentration faded quite often. (C+)"
1,Very boring-gave up on it,Cook reintroduced some old characters using the same story line descriptions. I felt I was rereading a previously read novel. Editors missed many writing errors which made for awkward sentences. I finished only half the book and gave up
3,Good re-master of the debut album by a UK proto-prog band,"This work is a good example of the early 70's UK proto-prog (Moody Blues, Spring and Cressida oriented), with a soft symphonic mellow touch. There are interesting and simple songs here, such as ""April 73"", ""You are"" and other sad songs like ""A prayer""; moreover you find here the best and most progressive song, the title-track, which is divided into two parts, by adding the mellow sound, the classic organ and real fine strings ... well I don't like this genre very much (actually I don't like the majority of the bands whose sound is too much Moody Blues and Barclay James Harvest oriented !!), nevertheless I recognise a certain taste within these simple compositions, making this album quite interesting ..."
3,Helpful information in this book,"7 Steps to successful selling is a quick read, I was able to get through it in one evening.I found the emphasis placed on activity rather than time spent to be useful, as well as the process for conducting sales appointments.I was slightly disappointed in the reliance on referrals to provide prospects, while numerous authors discuss the importance of referral marketing-- it is clearly the optimal method; the method for gathering referrals given here is nothing new.I do believe this is a worthwhile book to read, as you will get some useful pointers in it, it does leave something to be desired."
3,SHE HAS A LUST FOR LIFE - PREY IT'S NOT YOURS!,"LOST ON A STORMY NIGHT TONY AND HIS SEXY GIRLFRIEND HELEN, ALONG WITH TWO OTHER COUPLES AND JACK , A MYSTERIOUS HITCHHIKER WANTED BY THE LAW , SEEK REFUGE DEEP IN UNEXPLORED WOODS.

BUT ALONG WITH THIS DESIRE COME GRISLY MURDERS , AS ONE BY ONE THE TEENS ARE BRUTALLY BUTCHERED IN A NEVER ENDING NIGHT OF SAVAGE LUST"
3,Wilderness and the American Mind,"This book is about the origins of the wilderness preservation movement. Apparently it began as a doctoral dissertation and has been layered over and revised in subsequent publications since 1967. Whatever its original focus was, the bulk of the current version is concerned with the politics of wilderness preservation in America. This is hardly a book about how Americans have explored, experienced, or lived adventurously in the wilderness. Nor is it chiefly about the tension between civilization and nature. There is some of all of that in the early chapters, but the discussion there is more of an overview and so lacks detail and depth. In later chapters the writing often descends into journalistic reporting of tedious minutia. This will delight some readers and tire others."
5,The Best!,"In the early '70s, I was a student in Rod's Nash's ""Wilderness and the American Mind"" class at UC Santa Barbara,and we used his book, among many others. The class was transformative, and I now plan to use this book in my own classes. This in combination with Tim Eagan's ""The Big Burn"" are highly compatible readings that examine envionmental issues from different perspectives. I recommend Nash's book; it is still very timely and captures the essence of the foundations of environmentalism, American attitudes, and the Westward Movement."
2,Not Very Inspiring,"For those who are unfamiliar with Gebrselassie, they will find this book incredibly boring. I, an avid runner, found this book to be a pretty horrible tribute to the greatest distance runner in the last 25 years. Most running books describe races in quite detail and focus on each of the tiring laps that a runner endures. This book on the otherhand basically skips over that saying ""Haile won this, got the world record...or Haile lost this, and all of Ethiopia was angry at him."" It doesn't go into any detail though. Rather than Haile the runner, this book focuses on Haile the businessman which is not what he is known for nor is it was most people even care much about."
3,Sverige book on the Greatest athlete,"A ok book in my opinion. You get to learn all the tough times that Haile goes through, and all is victories and running times. I would like a bit more on the actual training. All in all a bit thin."
5,Not just for runners,"Denison takes you on a journey into the life of a fine athlete and sportsman. Keep in mind that this book should not be sought after by just the runners or athletes of the world but by anyone looking to discover the life of a man who is exemplary in many aspects. From Haile's determination to overcome, his generosity, his outlook on humanity to his grit and perseverance you will discover a man who is unforgettable. To me, this was not just a story of one of the greatest distance runners of all time but a story of a living legend whose perception of the world and those around him is alone worthy to hold the banner of 'The Greatest'. It is clear that the author (Denison) was passionate about sport yet recognizably passionate about what sport can do for community, country and humanity. I truly enjoyed this book and recommend it highly!"
5,Great Reflection,"This book is great tribute to Haile Gebreselassie. I thought that this book was well pieced together and it gives a good introduction to who he is and what he stands for. It would be nice if Haile could have been the author himself. Honestly, this book inspired me through a summer of great training and once you start reading you don't want to put the book down."
2,Limited features and poor timepiece,"I bought this watch hoping for a quality watch. Although I like its plain look (don't like any gold trim), it is not actually a good watch. Unlike a Seiko I have that was cheaper, it does not have a power reserve, so if you take the watch off overnight, it will stop. The Seiko will ""remember"" the time, even if the hands no longer turn, and once shaken, it will automatically move the hands to the correct time.The Mido also does not keep accurate time. It loses about 2 minutes each week. I don't think that is acceptable in a watch at this price. I don't recommend it."
5,Fabulous Writing,"This is without question one of the best books I have ever read. I was mesmerized by the characters and drawn into ""Fire and Brimestone"" myself. The descriptiveness was beatiful. You are left with the feeling that these people are involved in your life. It is the story of self discovery at its best."
5,Breathtaking!,"What a book! I had it read in less than one and a half days and that is because I had to work. Even today I have some of the mixed up feelings that Ninah had about religion, sex, politics, family, and relationships. Sheri Reynolds put me in Ninah's shoes (or if you will Ninah was put in mine). I wish I could have read this book as a teenager to help me realize that I am not the only one that has gone through obstacles in life. I didn't want to put the book down it had me so wrapped up that I soon thought I was in love with James. What a life Ninah lived.... She represents the troubles that we all have at some times and helped me to realize that my life to is an exciting "" book"", worth re-reading over and over. Talk about a lesson in life. Great job Sheri Reynolds!"
4,Good read,"I found the characters, esp Ninah, to be well drawn and interesting. Some details of the story were a bit bizarre but necessary to move the plot and develop theme. Kept my interest. I especially enjoyed reading the ways in which the community stayed together when it was falling apart. Very good book."
4,A vivid tale of fighting for your place,"This was the second of Sheri Reynolds books I read. I like her easy-going style, and find her shorter than average tales are not lacking in prose or creativity. In just 300 pages, the author vividly brings to life Ninah, her extended family, and the tight charismatic cult she grows up in. The struggles of the young Southern girl are very believable. She is torn between what she is taught by the people she loves, and the questions raised by the hypocrisy she feels in her gut and sees all around her. I think most people can identify with the desire to belong. Sheri Reynolds gives Ninah a spirit that fights for her terms within her sense of place. I have recommended this book and author for her colorful, offbeat characters."
5,In Rapture,"This was one of the best books I have ever read. I laughed, I cried. The characters were realistic - they had their flaws but you couldn't help loving them. I have reccommended this book to everyone I know."
1,mundane repetition,"The mundane repetition of ridiculous medieval religious practices in a 20th century American landscape did not work for me. I did keep reading, hoping for the development of the main characters, which had the potential of being interesting and valid literary characters. Unfortunately this never happened. The ending was as ridiculous as the rest of the novel."
5,"A very unique tale, beautifully woven...","As Sheri Reynolds weaves her story I found myself getting very intensly involved in the plot, at times not knowing which way it was going to turn. She left me, feeling angry, sad, full of tears and laughter at the events that took place in the little corner of life she exposes. She definately put together a wonderful piece of fiction. It's the first time I have read a book by her and will look into others"
4,high school senior review,"I read the Rapture of Canaan by Sheri Reynolds as a project in the last semester of my senior year. Overall I thought this book was a good read. I am usually not a reader however on this book it caught my interest. The way the church of fire and brimstone and God's almighty baptizing wind is very strange and in some ways cruel. This book will also bring about a lot of questions in yourself and show you how you believe. This book will just bring out so many opinions of your own. Most of all though it is a very well told story and easily related to seeing as how we all encounter some form of others religious ways somehow. I related to this book due to Ninah is unsure who to trust but soon enough she finds that not everyone is who they say they are. If you are planning on getting this book I recommend it highly, And more so for someone with an interest in religion."
1,Ridiculous,"It seemed like the author was trying way too hard to make this book ""deep"" and ""spiritual"", but I found myself laughing the whole time. The characters were silly and unbelievable, and the part where James and Ninah got it on in the prayer room was crap--I didn't believe it for a second and still can't believe the author fed us this and so many people just ate it up. Come on, this was a cliched and stereotypical book that had absolutely no emotional impact on me whatsoever. The only thing this book made me think about was why just because Oprah recommends a book, people will read it and praise it, even if it is contrived and silly."
1,"nasty, just nasty","if it was the author's intent to disgust me, then she was successful. i put off reading this book, and now i know why. i think the author's intent was to come up with a story to make us rethink our value systems/religious beliefs...but she did it so immaturely...concentrating on the bizarre punishments to feel jesus's pain. let's take the basic same events, and set the story in a normal child's life...one who isn't in a cult-like religion...still have her struggle with her morality...and i think you have a much better story."
1,Nothing special,"What's all the fuss about? I thought this was a very flimsy story barely held together by it's thin and implausible premise. The writer's tone comes across as overly conscious of her attempts to portray Southern attitudes, personalities, and religious beliefs and contradictions. The ending was almost laughable and left me wondering why I bothered sticking with the book to get to it. I know someone is bound to try to illuminate the ""deeper meaning"" of the conclusion, but let's face it, there's nothing deep about this novel. It's packaged to look sophisticated, but it's extremely simplistic and banal."
3,Why o' why...,"are there so many books that start off great then lose steam just as you are really getting into them????? I really liked the way this book started. It's weird, it's creepy, I was diggin' it. It was an interesting story about a subculture that few of us ever get to see. Then WHAM!! It just stopped. I don't know if I found it to be unbelievable? I don't think so because I know virtually nothing about this populations. It just stopped. Three quarters of the way into the book, I found myself reading it to finish it.I give it three stars because it was a story different from many but the ending was nothing to write home about...."
4,The Rapture of Canaan,"This book was a very intersesting insite to a girl who is bounded to rules and laws that are difficult for her to obey. Ninah's home life is unimaginable to me and it is from a great perspective. Not only does the book talk about her home life but also many other trials that a teenage girl goes through. When she falls in love with James it adds an amazing twist to the story and her trials at school. home, and with herself and her body add to the suspention to the story. The books ending leaves the reader to think of several possibilities that can happen to Ninah and her child and their life in the community."
4,A very enjoyable book with a very likeable central character,"One of Ninah's greatest revelations is when she realizes that those who lie the most at Fire and Brimstone are the ones who claim to be the most pious, and those that tell the truth like Nanna are considered ""sinners"" and need to be redeemed. Nanna is really the spiritual leader at Fire & Brimstone, and certainly the wisest, but the patriarchal Grandpa Herman could never acknowledge this. A very enjoyable book with a very likeable central character in Ninah."
5,I could not put it down!,"After reading the book, I wanted to read other books by Mrs. Reynolds. I cried, I laughed, I became angry. It is a touching story that made me think twice. I have recommended it to all of my friends."
5,A tremendously compelling and beautiful story!,"A truly unforgettable story. I think there is a little bit of Ninah in all of us. We worry about the future and agonize over the past. We make painful attemps to separate right from wrong. We all feel at some point lost or trapped. Ninah's story is both horrific and inspirational. The Rapture of Canaan simply shows how God enters our lives in several different ways and no matter how agonizing life may be, God will be there and he is always guiding you towards the direction of glory."
5,Absolutely stunning,"I read all night until I finished, totally enthralled. A fabulous book. Same effect on me as ""Beloved"" ... what a masterpiece."
1,Just didnt like it.,"I didn't like this book. It was very well written, but in the end I was disappointed. In order to like a book, and its characters and its story, I have to believe what I am reading. If the storyline has me perplexed, because the characters are doing things that would not be within the normal parameters of the plot and theme, I scratch my head. If this was truly a community of religious people, following their leaders rules and regulations no matter how ridiculous or abusive, than the events would have ever taken place. You have to suspend disbelief and I don't like doing that. Ninah and James would have NEVER been aloud to be alone, never. Not for Prayer time, quiet time or hammer time. Grandpa Herman, while not the smartest man alive, would have been worldly enough to know the brains of young adults, no matter who they were. Now I know it's a work of fiction, and it ""could have"" happened, but something deep down in me kept doubting it and it ruined the book for me all together."
2,"Interesting read, but disappointing ending...","This is the first book by Sheri Reynolds that I have read and I picked it up on a whim because a woman passing by me mentioned to her friend that she loved it. Although the metaphors and symbolism are entertaining, ""The Rapture Of Canaan"" did not leave me spell bound. The tale of a Christian cult somewhere in the Deep South with a typical evil minister/grandfather and the star crossed lovers Ninah and James was interesting enough but to be honest with you, I never really grew to care about these characters. When I came to the last page knowing that there was an afterword I was relieved because I thought the afterword would contain more about what happened. The ending left no sense of closure for me...."
4,"Well written, funny, sad, quick read","Wow! Great story. I don't want to give away too much but...This is a story told by a young woman growing up in a sect known as the Church of Fire and Brimstone and God's Holy Baptizing Wind (need I say more:)), led by her hardhearted, ironfisted grandfather. He is the ultimate authority on all things godly and heavenworthy, metting out punishments and fines at the drop of a hat. The writer does a good job weaving together the main characters and develops them well throughout. I often felt like I was watching the ""compound"" where all the characters lived from afar. There are a few major sad events in the book. All the way I was rooting for Ninah, feeling her highs and lows and loved her even more when she began to challenge the status quo. I only wish she had taken what was hers and ran away from the ""commune""!"
3,You call that an ending?,"Although I agree that there are religious fanatics out there such as this cult, I found the gutless wonders masquerading as adults in this group amazing. They came across as a bunch of stupid sheep. Now we can understand how there can be people like David Koresh running around. Anyway, about the ending...it seemed to me as though the author ran out of good ideas and just threw some contrived ending together. It was pointless and implausible in my opinion. This had the potential to be a very good book, but the author missed lots of opportunities to deepen her characters and turn a timely topic into something to make us think. By the way, I don't read books simply because Oprah recommends them; I found this book lying around the office. I'm glad I didn't buy it."
2,Not very satisfying at all.,"I'm a pretty diverse reader, so I decided to give this one a go. It started out somewhat interesting, but then just sort of made me keep saying, ""Okay...what's the point here?"" I really like Ninah, the main character, but I keep waiting for her to break free from the chains of this commune she lives in. I guess the ending is somewhat a symbol of her doing this, but I closed the book wondering, ""why did I read this?"" I grew bored with a lot of the goings on in this community and found many of the ""punishments"" just ridiculous. I'm pretty open when it comes to accepting different religions, but this was just way out there for me. Ninah's relationship with her Nanna was the neatest one in the book. I'm glad I'm finished...now I can move on to something more fulfilling."
2,What happened here?,"I found the premise of this book to be quite unbelievable...but maybe I'm just a little too Roman Catholic. I did not identify with a single character and was frankly a little disgusted with the main character at the end. Only 17, she made the most un-wise choices I think a 10 year old would have handled the situation better. I would have quit reading without another thought about the story but had to complete it for my book club."
4,I couldn't put it down!,"This is a masterful coming of age story about a very young girl in a cult. Ninah is brought together with a young boy by her parents and grandfather who is the leader of the cult. Everyone in the cult except for Ninah grandmother is so afraid of being tempted to sins of the that Ninah even hides from her mother that she has begun to have her period. As a resident of the Bible belt and with no disrespect intended, I think I know these people. A great story."
3,rush to the finish,"The first 80% of this novel is stellar. However, I felt that Ms. Reynolds rushed to tie up all of the loose ends in the last 20% of the book. The result is an end package that is not neatly tied. I was very disappointed by the ending."
4,Does brainwashing really happen?,Sheri Reynolds embraced the subject of total religious devotion and challenged conventional thinking in this novel. Living in a community where a religious organization similar to Fire and Brimstone exists the reali life interactions are dead on. Reynolds makes the reader wonder about what goes on behind closed doors.
3,"The Book Had Its Moments,But Wasn't Worth What I Paid for It","I bought this book with basically no idea what was inside of it. I had very few expectations. Still, I managed to be disappointed. I enjoyed the ending; it made me laugh, but this is not worth buying the book. Most of the characters are slip-shod."
3,Good Book for Discussion,"This was an interesting story of a sect/cult religion the punishments were awful for their ""sins' ie. drinking you spent the night in a grave, if you lie your bed was filled with nettles for you to sleep on so you feel Jesus' pain.Those parts were hard to read but it was a well written story that I couldn't put down.The reason for only 3 stars is the ending it was very unsatifying and left you wanting the rest of the story.However this is a book I would recommend."
4,"JENNIFER, MOTHER IN ALABAMA","THIS BOOK IS EXTREMELY THOUGHT PROVOKING. IT STAYED WITH ME LONG AFTER I FINISHED. I CONTINUED TO ANALIZE IT EVEN DURING THE NEXT BOOK I READ. IT WAS AN EASY READ IN THAT I COULD NOT PUT IT DOWN. IT WAS IMPORTANT THAT IT STIMULATED MY ""PEANUT BUTTER & JELLY BRAIN""! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS BOOK."
5,WOW!,"I was very impressed by this novel. It really left me changed after I had finished. I've never been a very religious person, but you don't have a history of religious to be left breathless by this novel. The characters are so vivid and real. It deals almost with macrocosmic/mircocosmic worlds. Where a small part of society can reflect on society as a whole. This book brings out flaws in set ways almost like the novella ""The Lottery."" Tradition doesn't have to set our patterns for life and neither does relgion. It's a wonderful read, and since I do not want to ruin the book for you I'll just say read it. It's awesome and profound."
3,Poetic up to the end.,"This book has wonderful lyrical lines and heart wrenching characters but they also seem to iritate at times. Several characters just seemed rather angry and tired of being where they were and even after terrible things continued to happen, they remained and were misserable. The story, however, was easy to relate to, being from the bible belt of the United States and pulled at my heart strings. You will live to get to the end of this book and then be tormrnted at the main characters decission to stay"
4,"Believeabe, fascinating and though provoking!","I have no doubt that cults exist in every state in the union. Many people make the mistake of confusing charisma for leadership potential. This book explores the dynamics within the cult so that the reader is left with more understanding for the cult members' behaviors. Surely, no one having read this book could be so judgemental of those actions or unaware of the incredible strength and intelligence required to walk away from it -- especially if one had grown up in the cult and never developed any perspective of the world outside that cult's power"
4,A must read.,I too could not put this one down. This book is a story everyone can learn something from. I found it an extremely moving story.
4,A novel I'll remember...,The story was so interesting & the book was so easy to read that I read the book in 2 sittings.Reynolds is an excellent writer & she enabled me to envision the characters--and I couldn't get them out of my mind!My somewhat interest in religion had me even moreso impressed by this book--but I still recommended this book to everyone I know (even those not so interested in relgion).I can't wait to read Reynolds' other novels!
5,It raptures you...,This book is amazing! It captures your heart and lifts your spirits. It is a story unlike anything you've ever read before. You will find yourself wishing you were part of their lives... I strongly recommend this book.
4,"A very thought provoking, well written story.","I really enjoyed this book from beginning to end. I felt it was a quick read and remained interesting all the way through. I was very impressed with this author, she wrote so that I actually felt what Ninah was feeling. It also brought back some feelings from my own youth, being raised in a very strick church where you are scared into ""believing"". I highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a good story."
4,Interesting and Enjoyable,I throughly enjoyed this book but when I finished it I couldn't help thinking there was something 'missing' in it. I guess I really wanted a happy ending for Ninah and Canaan.
4,I can't stop thinking about it!,"Once I opened the book for the very first time, I read just about half the book--because it was easy to read & the story was so interesting! The main characters are so well developed I had them in my thoughts the entire time I read the book & for days afterwards. I admit, my interest in religion probably made me more involved in the book then I should've been. Although I am not a very religious person myself, I found myself analyzing the book constantly. I've recommended this book to everyone. One flaw: THE ENDING CAME MUCH TOO SOON!"
1,Oprah-style Christianity,"I expected a Christian story in the Oprah Club to be less than supportive. What I did not expect was the disgusting and deeply offensive handling it received by Ms. Reynolds, such as in the following passage from p. 72, where I ended my reading of this book:That night I dreamed of Jesus on the cross, on a cross in the field behind the church....I dreamed I went outside in just my gown and walked up to him. He was too nearly dead to speak, but all he had in his eyes was love for me. And I walked up to the wound in his side where he'd been stuck with a sword. I put my mouth on that wound and began drinking from it, swallowing his blood. And then the wound his his side became a mouth, kissing me back, and I could slip my tongue into the wound, feel the inside of his skin with my tongue, circle it there tasting him."
2,If you must have it then buy it used.,"Please don't beleive the hype! Just because it is an OPRAH pick does not mean it is superb. This book is mediocre at best. I don't know where to begin. Like other reviewers the first few pages were interesting and then ...nothing! Dialogue, dialogue, and more dialogue without in depth description or anything else! After 40 odd pages the story doesn't move much. You could literally start in the begginning and open the second half of the book and still know exactly what was going on. The end was a dud! There were NO twists and turns in the plot. The reader already knows that the protagonists will be punished for their ""sins"" because it has been pounded into his/her head for 200 pages! This book is all quantity and no quality! No wonder the book is selling for ONE cent used on Amazon. Because those who have read it practically want to give the sh*t away."
4,Good Read,"This was my first book by Reynolds and I enjoyed it very much. Her setting is The Fire and Brimstone congregation and it centers on 15 year old Ninah and her pragmatic grandmother. Her characters are multi-dimensional, her setting believable and her plot made me cry, which I haven't done since reading Alice Hoffman's, ""At Risk"".Definitely a worthwhile read."
1,Only because Oprah picked it.,"I found little interesting or compelling within this book. Aside from Reynolds's final declaration of thanks for freedom and independence, I found most of the content offensive and appaling, not because it was blatently sexual or masocisitic, but because the story lacked origionality, the characters lacked depth, and the the narative lacked any kind of hook to keep me interested."
2,Very good up to a point.,"I read past the half-way point with interest and amazement that people who call themselves Christian can be so dumb and gullible as to follow a ""religious"" leader such as Grandpa Herman in this story. I know there are cults where people follow a leader, without exploring the Word of God for themselves, but it's really painful to read about them.I gave up when the girl got dunked for being pregnant. Just couldn't read anymore."
3,Kept me interested enough to read quickly,"The rapture of Canaan has been on my bookshelf for years waiting to be read. I finally decided that I would knock out all of the hardcovers and started with this one. It was well written and was a quick read. Maybe too quick too be really meaningful for me. I felt like I sat down for a meal, ate, but was still left hungry."
2,Disappointed,"I was really disappointed with this purchase. It was nothing like I expected it to be. In fairness, I shouldn't say its not a good book...my expectations were just much higher. I was hoping for something really ""moving"" & something that would re-ignite my spiritual fire~ but this fell way flat for me. :("
4,Review - The Allure of Hope,Some great concepts in this book! Push through some of the analogies in the early chapters and you won't be sorry that you read it.
5,A must read for all women!,"I have read many books on Christian women's issues, and this is by far the best! In contrast to most Christian books for women on the market, it's not about how much harder we women need to try, or what we're doing wrong, but it's about how much God loves us and desires intimacy with us and how important our hearts are on this journey toward Him. Her writing is visionary and mystical while remaining firmly grounded in the Christian faith. This book has awakened my heart in a powerful way. It has given me vision and helped me to relax in God's love for me. If you liked any of the John Eldredge books, this one is a must!"
5,This book is a keeper.....,"...this book makes perfect sense. If you are feeling stuck or isolated or spiritually lost, this book will explain what it is that you are experiencing and will give you, in turn, a sense of hope and peace. The Lord understands the hearts of women all too well. I thank the author for this book and will continue to be a fan of hers. Write another one soon!"
4,momoteen,"This is the loudest, most obnoxious alarm I've ever heard but it does the job! My teenager now gets up!!!!"
1,Snooze bar sets off alarm / So does setting alarm and time,"The unit will run on the included 9 volt battery. BUT the unit sent will sound when you hit the ""light/snooze"" button. This means you CANNOT pack it in a duffle or suitcase as anything touching that bar causes it go off. The ""alarm"" also chirps every time you hit the HR or MIN button to set the time or alarm which is aggravating. And it does all this even if the alarm is set to off. A minor problem for a truck driver perhaps but a deal breaker for this reviewer who needs to pack it in luggage. It is neat that the clock works on either 12 volts or the included 9 volt battery; but the mentioned design ""feature"" will mean you need to pull the battery out before packing. AND if you don't want alarm to sound when you hit snooze or when you set the time or alarm, pass this clock by."
2,Basics,"For a book that is titled 'The Basics', there was way too much jargon with no explanation. For example, there is a paragraph that tell the reader to 'learn the difference between the two types of hands, the fixed and the following', but then there is no explanation of the differences or even what either means. It also references different parts of the horse without explanation, such as the 'withers'. I did finally find an appendix that explains some of the terms, but it is never referenced in the book, and it does not explain all of the terms."
4,For lovers of mystery and San Francisco,"I read this book because I heard the author speak and I'd liked his nonfiction -- I don't usually read mysteries. But I ended up staying up late until I finished it. The San Francisco details are vivid and evocative, and the mystery has so many twists and turns. Loved it!"
1,I hate it!,"Do not buy this model! This first one I received for Christmas did not work at all and was returned. The second worked fine for the first few months and then started acting up after the warranty ran out. It can not make it through twenty minutes of a movie without freezing up and making a loud revving noice. I have looked around on the internet and this seems to be a very commom problem. I tried calling the Audiovox customer service and they were very rude and worthless. They would not listen or give me any troubleshooting help. They told me they would only help me with the problem if I sent them $93. After much frustration I told the customer service supervisor that I would write a review warning people about this product. She basically told me that people who write product reviews have too much time on their hands. Well, from my idle hands I warn everyone do not buy this product!"
1,Horrible,"I bought this at the store and had to exchange it five times. The last one's battery would not charge. The previous one kept on stopping before getting into the movie. All of them had a lot of churring going on. After 5, I told them I quit. I bought it at 207 on sale but it turned out to not be a great deal."
4,Audiovox PE702,"I received this portable dvd player as a birthday gift from my parents and it's been worth its'weight in gold! We've taken it on trips to Florida, Georgia, and Chicago and my kids just love it! I love being able to connect it to the television in my hotel rooms when I travel. I also take it to work with me and utilize it on my breaks to watch movies and listen to cds. I wouldn't trade it for anything!"
3,ok,The overall dvd player is really good but the battery really doesn't last too long. I dont think that any way to rewind or fast foward the dvd player itself without the remote.
4,Eddie Bauer DVD PE702,Very nice picture and sound for the money. I use mine all the time on the plane watching movies. Don't lose the remote though. You need the remote to perform certain functions.
1,STAY AWAY - I BOUGHT 2 & BOTH BROKE!,"We purchased this model just to use when taking the occasional road trip.The first one we bought just quit spinning the DVD's & the screen would just flash. We returned it to Target where we were only allowed to exchange for the exact same thing.So the second one worked fine for about 4 months. However, it broke & the problems were the same (flashing screen, etc).We tried to return it to Target, but it had been more than 90 days, so now I am stuck with a $100 repair charge from Audiovox for a DVD player that will MOST LIKELY break again. And the repair work will only be warrantied for 90 days.I don't plan to have it repaired. I am shopping for a different brand. I thought since the name &quot;Eddie Bauer&quot; was on it, it would be quality. THEY ARE JUNK! STAY AWAY!"
4,Great Overview of This Leading Master's Work,"This is a great boxed-set of Richter's work. If you are familiar with the catalogue raisonne format, you should do well to expect small illustrations. On the other hand, there is an accompanying volume that provides larger illustrations, albeit fewer than the main catalogue. The third volume is printed in German text with some nice pictures of Gerhard and his work. In the case that you don't speak or read German, may I suggest The Daily Practice of Painting to compliment your study."
3,Gerhard Richter: A Catalogue Raisonne,I can't believe the Editor(s) of this book thought the reader would enjoy seeing only thumbnail illustrations of all his work. I found this ridiculous for the price I paid for this item. Very much dissappointed.
5,BUY THIS BOOK SET,"If you get a chance to purchase this book set on the artist Gerhard Richter, do it. This book will be worth $1000 within 5 years - mark my words. I have been collecting Richter books for years and this is one of the most sought after Richter books on the world market. I used to see these books in the $75-$150 range and now can't find a hardcover set for under $300. Well worth the money."
2,Great Voice Needs Better Material,"The best cuts on this album--Let it Snow!, Away in a Manger, and The Christmas Song--aren't nearly enough to reccommend it. The so-called ""pop"" tunes marginalize the spirit of the holiday, and they're kind of stupid to boot. ""Reindeer Boogie"" is an embarrassment. Trisha has a great voice and is one of the great interpretive vocalists in any format. This album came out several years before Martina McBride's evergreen collection and could have been moved by the same spirit that informed that holiday classic."
4,Worth Watching/Owning...,"At first, I hesitated to get this because of the negative reviews here but wanted to see for myself and got it anyway. After watching, I thought this blu-ray was not bad. Yes, the video pro-production was annoying in some parts but overall I enjoyed this blu-ray. The orchestra conducted by Chailly was really good and Urmana and the other female singer did a good job. I thought Alagna sang fine but notes were sometimes not accurate. I liked the ballet and kids' dance. The PQ is somewhat disappointing: distant (zoom-out) shots don't look very clear and sharp. AQ is excellent, however. All in all, this blu-ray was an enjoyment to me. I will definitely watch it over again. I'd encourage you to see it for yourself. You can rent at least..."
2,disappointing return,"This was supposed to be a magnificent return of Aida to La Scala. It is very disappointing. The singers and their signing and acting are OK, but far away of being magnificent. The sound of the Disc is certainly not portraying the incredible amount of people on the stage, in Act II in particular. Bluray technology allows for a much fuller sound. The worst of all is the video production and camera movements. The close-ups in the middle of the arias and the ballet make no sense at all and are really disturbing.The only reason to buy this Disc is to see the glitzy production in full Bluray detail. Verdi deserves better!"
3,illusions of grandeur,"If it were not for the Triumphal Scene, this production could be forgotten. It was poorly filmed. You were distracted when scenes changed by flimsy material blowing in front of the cameras. The processional was truly fantastic, well orchestrated, and grand opera at its ultimate. Who said you need animals for this scene?All in all, the music is always grand, the set was very good, but the direction and filming leave a lot to be desired. I am surprised the La Scala audience was not letting their usual vocal reactions be heard! Perhaps it was edited!"
4,Verdi Aida,"Thanks to amazon for sending this awesome blu ray title, well about the product, it is infact a great collection so was i too keen to own one, breathtaking visuals and amazing sound. thanks once again"
4,Better Soccer Instruction THan Expected!,I was surprised at the quality soccer instruction this program offers.This was first lent to me by another soccer mom and I really liked it.My son worked on the skills shown in the video and we have seen improvement.These popular soccer titles by Marty Schupak are also available on Amazon's Video On Demand program for as low as $2.99.Championship Soccer DrillsBackyard Soccer Drills34 Soccer Goalie DrillsSoccer Shooting DrillsSoccer Fast Footwork DrillsAdvanced Soccer Drills
4,What's The Deal With Soccer Shooting?,"What's the deal with soccer shooting? We don't take out a gun and fire atthat funny shaped sphere. Why do they call it a shot when there is no Dr. or needle around?Here's what SOCCER SHOOTING DRILLS is:A compilation of drills directed at players giving them the best chance to be successful.All in all this is a ""value added"" asset for soccer coaches like me. When I ambeating my brains out trying to organize our next practice, I'll turn on thisvideo and not only take a few drills for practice but create new ones from ideas seen.There is a time for work and a time for fun in all soccer practices.This program has both! What it may lack in perfect technique is made upwith credible fun skill drills.This is one product that I have no trouble recommending.Soccer Coaching:Championship Soccer DrillsThis reviewer also gave this other soccer program a positive review."
1,Don't bother,"I got this video for my 10 year old son thinking that it would show him some neat tips and tricks to improve his game, but it's basically a training video for coaches, and not a very good one at that. The voice over for the video is dated and very boring. The drills are also pretty basic and boring. Nothing really spectacular here. The whole video looks like it was shot in your neighborhood park, it's not very professional at all. I can't believe what they are charging for this video!! I paid 24.99 and am totally disappointed. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!"
3,Good car wash brush,I am a long time user of soft brushes to wash my cars. This one has excellant bristle texture but is a little off balance when reaching over hood and roof. The brush is advertized on its packaging that an interchangable short handle was suppose to come with it but it did not.
4,I agree Good Cook Book,"I agree with the others who have reviewed this book , it is mostly full of cooking methods and ideas, not full of package foods or drinks to make you thin, like some lay to claim. I knew what I bought after going through it at the store before buying it online, I recommend you do that if you are not sure what you are getting. I picked up a few good meals to make for those in the hurry don't know what to make nights. I have also lost weight through exercising with weights and walking and I recommend the Backsmart Fitness Plan by Dr. Adam Weiss, a real complete workout with real people showing the moves not some model figure us mortals could never acheive. Hope this helps Both books helped me lose weight."
1,A good cookbook.,"I wonder why they have called this book a ""diet"" when it is actually a cookbook with elements/tips on eating less calories and practicing fitness. Some of the recipes look good but I have 3 excellent cookbooks and I do not need another one. It is quite disappointing to realize how misleading is the title and description. No wonder why there is no ""promise"" for any weight loss. After all with more diverse cooking and eating fewer calories who has achieved significant weight loss and succeeded to keep it off. I do not recommend this book unless as a cookbook."
1,total waste of money,in my opinion this book does not offer anything that isn't already common sense. the only thing in it that is any good are a couple of recipes.do not buy.
5,Great healthy way to eat and exercise!,I am so grateful to have found this book! It gives HEALTHY and practical information on how to eat and live healthier. I was so glad to see that a lot of the things I believed about weight loss were incorrect and to get the correct information. The meal suggestions and calorie info is very helpful as well. I would recommend it to anyone wanting to make a healthy change in their lifestyle!
4,No-Fad Diet,"After some years of trying to lose the weight, and then having other problems to prevent said loss of weight, it seems that this book does seem to offer what I have been looking for. Not to mention, this book has been recommended me by others in and around my community. So, it would appear that this is what I have been looking for and what I need."
2,ummmm,Bought the audio version on Penn's recommendation from his web site.It is pretty weak. Some good points but not worth it to me. You get some schmoozing stuff then it quickly rambles off into personal relationships etc. Fine but not what I bought it for.
5,Super,"I can not say enough positive things about this book. I only wish there was a book two to follow up with this book.As a homeschooler this book gave me the start of a science program with my young children. As a former school teacher, I wish I had had this book when I began teaching.It has exciting experiments that are easy to do with simply inexpensive household items. The children first read the experiment then predict what they think will happen, do the experiment and document the results. This is the beginning stages of making a science experiment for the science fairs.I particularly liked that this book had the explanations of what was happening in simple to understand terms so that you can easily explain to the kids what happened and why the end result was what it was.Worth every penny.Enjoy"
5,How to do science experiements with young children,I purchased this book as a used item. It shows its wear but it has been gently used and it was just what I was looking for. I had always borrowed the book from a colleague so now it will be nice to not have to bother her any more. This book is out of print so I am grateful I was able to find it here.
4,"beware buyer, this radiator does not fit...",This radiator does not fit the ford explorer if it has AT and A/C. I am having to return mine. Sometimes customer service sucks.
2,Fair,This is not what I'd call an oral history. There were interviews but the bland voice that tells this story is the author's. Jean Boyd is not a storyteller. A lot of the information conflicts with what I've read elsewhere but there is no perspective. Also odd is to seperate the chapters by instrument so there is no chronological sense. It then becomes the story of the mucians. It's interesting but not a great book.
4,Awesome service,I lIke that the book came when it was suppose to and just in time for school! Great service and reliable
2,manotea,"The book ""Children of the Dust Bowl"" is a great little book for ""teemagers"" and gives a fair insight into many of the folks the went to California from the dustbowl area. The best book about the dustbowl is ""the Worst Hard Time"" by Timothy Egan."
5,Loved it!,I picked a copy of this book up with some others at a local store. I couldn't put it down once I started reading. I wish I had seen it while my grandparents were still alive. They were those children and lived in Kern county until they died. I was happy to find a book on this subject for my kids to read that presents the facts in a way that is acceptable for younger children. The pictures add so much and the faces of those precious people are full of strength and dignity. An amazing story of strength in the face of adversity not likely to be duplicated by our current spoiled society.
5,Children of the Dust Bowl,"Although my Father's family moved to California long before the Dust Bowl days, he worked many of the harvests in that area of California during the 1930's. I wanted to get more information on what the area was like. The book did provide some of what it was like and names of many of the towns around there. Who would like a hoard of people moving in, taking jobs, lowering wages, depending in many cases on public welfare. As a result, Bakersfield, CA became the western home of country music."
4,Children of the Dust Bowl: The True Story of the School of Weedpatch Camp,Great book. Basic history of the depression days and the hardships of families and conditions that prevailed. Pictures were very good and the text was easy to read and detailed. Highly recommend for anyone interested in this time period.
3,Would not recommend,"While this book is very comprehensive, it has way too much information that seems like it has been copied verbatim from some marketing brochures. Most of the mini-cases in the book are not very helpful and just add to the bloat.Also be aware that the SPSS version that comes with the software is slightly outdated, time-limited, and restricted in functionality (e.g. file-size).If you consider buying this book for the included SPSS version, don't. If you are looking for a good marketing research textbook, try to find something more condensed."
4,Good Book to Learn Mkt Research,"This is a good book for anyone at the grad level looking to learn the basics of mkt. research. The SPSS CD is useful and I found it to be a great tool, especially when doing complex regression projects. The examples provided are very useful. Though sometimes, some sections, seem drawn out, I enjoyed reading this book.A definite 'BUY' !"
2,Dull as dishwater!,Amazing that such fine performers offer such non-descript performances of this marvelous music. What went wrong?
5,Hold Onto Your Hats -- It's Gonna Be a Bumpy Scottish Ride!,"I've always loved this film, but I hadn't seen it in 15 years until I caught it recently on A & E or Bravo (can't remember which now) -- and now I'm going to buy it on video, so I can see it without interruption! Two things that I'd forgotten or missed about the film previously: It's very atmospheric -- Edinburgh in the '30s and the boarding school seem so oppressive and suffocating! And the film is very psychologically complex -- we witness Miss Brodie's gradual breakdown, and it is soon apparent that she is not merely the quirky, eccentric individual she at first seems, but is actually a very pitiable, disturbed, and dangerous person. What a fantastic, frightening work!"
2,Boring,"I finally caught up with this film, and, like so many high profile classics, I found it to be tedious. The script lumbered along and I found no enthusiasm for any of the characters. I must admit that the title character is complex and for that consideration, as well as the look of the period, I gave it 2 stars."
2,How's that again?,"This is certainly a woman's picture, with all that implies. The men in it are without exception weaklings and dunderheads who allow themselves to be pushed around like hogs on ice by Scottish schoolmarm Jean Brodie and her female pupils. As for the plot it's none too clear; about what you'd expect from former mental patient Muriel Spark, authoress of the original novel. After half a dozen years or so of aimless romancin' and pontificatin' Brodie eventually is canned from the school for her Fascist leanings, although anyone who thinks pro-Fascism was unusual in Great Britain and especially Scotland during the 1930's needs a history refresher. Male viewers might want to catch Pamela Franklin with her clothes off about 90 minutes in."
1,"""POINTLESS""","This is one of the worst movies I ever saw. I saw it theatrically when it came out and then saw it again twenty years later on TV, when I had hoped that a more adult perspective would enable me to appreciate the initial critics' reviews. WRONG! It was still awful. There didn't seem to be any point to character motivation (what little motivation there was). Then one day I saw the book in the library, and since the book is always better than the movie, I read it. No wonder the movie was pointless. The book was the same. Better to watch one or other of the versions of ""Goodbye, Mr. Chips""."
4,Murial Spark's Story Comes to Life,I had read the book after it was featured on the First Tuesday Book Club on Australian TV (ABC) and had the urge to view the video again after more than 20 years. The video brought the story to life although there were a few differences from the book. You could really believe that it was shot in Scotland in 1932. Maggie Smith was very good except in a few places where she over - acted. Watching with the subtitles on allows one to catch the dialog better.
5,The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie,"English actress Maggie Smith captivated viewers in 1969 with her Oscar-winning portrayal of the title character in director Neame's outstanding film. Based on a novel by Muriel Spark, this hit film doesn't shy from presenting Brodie's enthusiasm for Mussolini, nor her affair with a married man (real-life hubby Robert Stephens). A poignant character study of a woman whose uncomplete life and untamed spirit combine to blur her judgment, the movie is a fabulous showcase for Maggie Smith's dazzling talent."
2,Film Folly,"Watched the film after re-reading the book for Book Club. The film is a very ""stagey"" version of the book and differs markedly, particularly the ending. Maggie Smith does her best but is struggling to bring any sense of worth to the character, and the main students don't ""jell"" as realistic characters. Too much from the book is lost for it to be a reasonable replacement. Having said this, the book itself is a shallow attempt at portraying a weird character, so perhaps the film makers can be forgiven for trying to improve it. The school was certainly right in getting rid of Ms Brodie, a menace to all who came into contact with her."
2,Monstrous Passions,"A delightful film for visionary blindness and inspiration run wild... our most infatuating dreams are our most deadly. And its hilarious too. However the movie is exceptionally dark beneath the thin surface of comic understatement. A half-baked teacher leads one student to her death by her teaching, and another to heart-wrenching seduction, by her example. The need for heroism is revealed as egoistic violence. There are No redeeming characters. (Innocence of young children is accentuated only in order to be denied.)The whole philosophy of the film could be summed up by Brodie exclaiming, ""I will not let them crucify me.""A wonderful film for a glimpse of our psychological undercurrent, our popular and modern mode--a bottomless pit."
4,my favorite scene,"My favorite scene will always be when her lover shows her the picture that he painted and everything in the picture has Maggie Smith's eyes, including the dog."
3,Not fabulous,It was entertainigng. I however would rather have not boughtit but just rented to watch it. I bought it because of Maggie Smith who I think is a wonderful actor.
2,Breathless...Try Pointless,"This book went from zero to sixty in no time at all. First the heroine decides to change her outer appearance and occupation to keep men at bay because the last of a string of bad relationships drove her there; but then comes an average-looking ""joe"" who also seems to be very caring and deep and she jumps directly into his arms, mouth, hands; whichever. Not only was the story not consistent, the author seemed to forget what happened previously and would write something different later. Couple that with the fact that it took less then two hours to read and I have to say this book was POINTLESS."
5,Frugal Pizza Stone,"I make focaccia in this fryer because cast iron is more durable and cheaper than ceramic pizza stones. I don't really need the lid except to keep dust out of the pan when not in use. For the first year of ownership, I did not have any positive experiences with this item. Then I got a nylon brush and used it with baking soda to give the interior a thorough cleaning and then I finally understood what a cast iron nonstick surface looks like. So I recommend my cleaning method to the seasoning process otherwise your kitchen and your pores will be filled with the most godawful greasy shellacing.I regretted the money spent on the lid but I recommend this size fryer over the shallower pans and skillets."
1,Small Fry,"The chicken fryer was touted to be a little larger than it turned out to be. It's plenty deep, but you will be hard pressed to cook enough chicken to feed more than 2 to 3 people at a time. Considering that it takes 45 minutes to prepare ""southern style"" fried chicken, this is definitely something to consider before purchasing. I would recommend a larger vessel. Cast iron rocks, though!"
5,Bargain of bargains,"This big hunk of iron is one of the greatest things in my kitchen. It's great for frying chicken (as you might expect). But it's also wonderful for frying anything else you can imagine (it never lets me down with catfish), making pralines, cooking cornbread, making a mess of jambalaya, any sort of soup that strikes your fancy, or, well, you get the point.Care is easy, easy, easy--especially if you re-season the skillet on a yearly basis.You'll keep this pan for at least a decade--which means that you'll pro-rate the cost down to well under a penny a day. Can you beat that? No, really, if you can, I want to know about it."
5,Can't go wrong with cast iron!,"I've been gradually buying cast iron pieces to add to my cookware. I grew up using cast iron, but did not have any in my own kitchen as an adult. This is a really nice pan, great for frying chicken as the name suggests but is also handy for many other cooking applications. Love the nice high sides and cleans up great. Would recommend to anyone!"
4,Although I love Lodge cast iron........,"I really can't give this piece a 5 star rating. I have other pieces that are 5 star, but this piece is a little more cumbersome than useful. Also, there is the preseasoned coating to deal with. My other pieces were no problem, I love them, always have and always will. But this one leaves a disagreeable taste in the food. I guess my only alternative is to sand it down to the bare metal and start over with the seasoning. And as others have said, the smaller bottom surface tends to limit what I can use it for. I wish it had a straighter upward side wall instead of the slope.. Other than that, I am a happy Lodge customer and will continue to add to my cast iron collection!"
4,Nice Pan,"I thought this was a nice pan, but I don't think it was quite worth the $16 plus shipping. I thought it would be heavier for that price.It's still a good pan and I found plenty of recipes online for baked donuts. They usually call for them being piped onto a cookie sheet, but I just used the pan instead with fine results.I do agree the donuts are a little heavier than normal store-bought cake donuts, but still they are good. Just don't over fill the shapes and your donuts come out fine looking. Nothing stuck, not even to the center flutes.I will definitely use it again and try many different recipes. The donuts are not too big or too small. Fill in the forms with a pastry bag or plastic bag with a corner cut out, it makes it much easier to fill and the final product looks so much better."
4,"great pan, need a recipe","This is a very sturdy, well made pan. The doughnuts popped out effortlessly with just a thin coating of crisco shortening. One thing I really like is, each doughnut is approx. 3"" in diameter -- good portion control (unless you eat two....) I would have given it 5 stars if it came with a recipe I could use --- the Kaiser recipe is in metric measurements, and includes ingredients that I am unsure of (soft curd cheese?). I tried a recipe I found online, and it was just OK, nothing to rave about. But that is no fault of the pan! When I find a great recipe, this pan will get a real workout in my house."
2,Very disappointing,"The recipe that came with the pans is not easy to follow, since the measurements were in grams. I did not have a quick conversion chart. The so called ""donuts"" did not brown on the top when I followed the temperature and time directions. I tried to bake donuts again using a recipe from allrecipes.com and found the the so called donuts tasted more like muffins with a hole in the middle. I also bought the mini pan at the same time I bought the classic pan and had the same experience. The handling and care of both the classic donut pan and the mini pan takes more effort than I want to devote to keeping the ""donuts"" from sticking in future uses. There will be not future use because these pans will be in my next garage sale."
3,No U.S. recipe...,"A fine, well-made pan....BUT...the only recipe which comes with the pan is obviously European and lists ingredients in liter quantities, as well as items not common to the U.S.(such as ""1 package of vanilla sugar""...what in blue blazes is that!)...as a result, I've only been able to admire the pan...can't use it till I find a recipe!"
4,Happy leveler,"Great product, very easy to use and set up. I manage a cabinet shop and I use this all the time in taking field measurements and checking for plumb and level so there are no surprises later."
4,Learning Devanagari Script from a beginner's viewpoint,"I felt that ""A Crash Course to Learn the Devanagari Script (For Hindi, Marathi and Sanskrit Languages)"" was an excellent book for anyone who has no prior knowledge of Devanagari characters, but would like to pick up this skill rather quickly. The book has easy to follow lessons for learning each of the characters (and their corresponding phonetic sounds) of the Hindi/Marathi/Sanskrit languages, and enables the reader to master the memorization rapidly. Also, you can measure your progress by utilizing the numerous writing exercises in the book. These can help you to gauge your speed of recognition of the characters and your ability to sound out the more difficult combinations of letters.Overall, this is a good book for beginners, and could be a helpful ""pocket guide"" for more advanced students learning the Devanagari script."
3,"A good complement, thats all.","I was hoping this huge commentary would be the comprehensive commentary on Luke I've been looking for, but it's not. Bock does a good job in many ways, but he does not treat the obvious theological issues that the various texts actualize. E g today I studied Luk 22:31 where Jesus tells Peter of Satans request to ""sift you like wheat"". The obvious question that pops up in a readers mind is ""Can Satan request such things? And why does God grant him that? And how do God and Satan relate to one another?"" Unfortunately Bock does not discuss such issues, but merely skims on the surface >:-( which is very frustrating. Since I bought Bock I am often forced back to Geldenhuys older and much smaller commentary (the older NICNT series), who most often does take a shot at the real relevant issues of the text."
4,i needed it,"i got into this college class called ""art and christianism"" and we use this book as an overall reference of its history... its a pretty cool guide if you don't mind it being not as objective as it could be..."
4,Great textbook!,"This book, though required reading, helped me a lot with my History of Christian Afterlife class. Not really something I'd buy just for the fun of it, but I did learn a lot when I had to read it and use it for my papers in class."
3,A different look at heaven,A great book. I especially enjoy their take on the Mormon heaven. It is a fascinating point-of-view that satisfies the theological arguments as well as the parishioners needs.
5,andy is a genius,"andy greenwald has written an awesome book! if you are at all interested in anything 'emo' you should definately give it a read, especially if you are into Dashboard Confessional, Jimmy Eat World, or Weezer. As moving as it is brilliant you could easily finish this book in a couple of days as I did. It is a book a music lover or anyone for that matter can easily relate to. Also if you enjoyed the book and want to talk to Andy or people who have also read his book check out his site! Its really obvious he didn't write the book for money alone because he really cares about what we all have to say and that is reflected in his book. So if you haven't already go out and buy NOTHING FEELS GOOD. Trust me you will get good use out of it. Im already reading it for the second time."
2,Overthought,"I thought this book looked a little to deep into some songs and not deep enough into getting all the facts right. One section in particular about Sonething Corporate seemed a little petty to me. They talked about a song from their Leaving Throught the Window album and went on some over-feminist rant about them feeling the need to save the girl in the song. The songs about a girl who sleeps around as a form of self-validation, to make herself feel attractive. The book makes it sound crazy. It was also written a little to much like a magazine for my taste. I love emo and I just don't think this book did the genre or the bands justice. It doesn't seem as if the author really listens to emo on a regular fan-like basis to appreciate it."
1,this book is worthless,"The author never details the history of emo. As stated before in an early review, ""emo"" is nothing more than a style of hardcore. If you want a real progression of the style, remove bands like Sunny Day, Dashboard, Braid, etc. and replace them with Heroin, Uranus, Honeywell, Assfactor 4, Angel Hair, Policy of Three, Portraits of Past, and Merel. What about current bands like Funeral Diner, Envy, and Amanda Woodward? Whatever happened to the European emo scene? Ebullition and Gravity records?This book and its defenders are ridiculous. The history is about as inaccurate as a person can imagine.It's also ridiculour to believe pop punk and indie rock ever could be associated with emo."
3,Music,"I am a college kid who picked up this book because i wanted to learn about ""emo"" music and the history of ""emo"". There were ups and downs of the book which made the book an average book. The history of the first ""emo"" bands were very interesting and i found out about many different bands that i would have never found out about before then. Some of the chapters were to long and seemed to repeat information. That is my simple review of the book, but i have a few more things to say to some of the other reviewers. If you are going to trash someone's book you should at least take your time and read the whole book before jumping to conclusions. Honestly who cares if Texas Is The Reason is ""emo"" but Dashboard isnt ""emo""; i thought bands where supposed to be about the music and not some stuipd title. The whole purpose of music is to express and help yourself, so stop worrying about titles or other things that will have no positive outcome. Start caring about the music."
2,Ok but missing some key bands,"It's an ok read but seems to really be concerned with ""emo"" of the past 2 or 3 years. Where are bands like Sense Field, Texas is the Reason, etc?"
1,save your money,"The author wouldn't know emo, if there really is such a thing, if it walked up and slapped his face off. Sadly, no one has yet hit him. This is not to say the author does not write well... he does and excellent job of cashing in, selling out, laying down hearsay as fact, and misconstruing something he knows nothing about to misinform the reader. Avoid if you care about fact."
1,"Nothing Feels Good: Punk Rock, Teenagers, and Emo","When I first picked up this book, i'll admit it, I was a bit skeptical. Then I read through Andy's (we're on a first name basis now!) Dashboard Confessional bio-pulp and now I am downright disgusted! I hope that ""Andy"" did a poor job of keying into the emo mind, but unfortunately, he did not. He gives a good account of the consumers of this year's suckerjuice. I have never felt as justified for disliking a music and it's absoloute lack of values and humor or sense of invention. He does fail to describe the 'scene' of 5-10 years ago when these bands were part of a real underground network and didn't get help from the uber-corporate monolith."
2,"Ok written, but wrong generation","Emo began in the late 80's around the times of ""Rites of Spring"" and ""Moss Icon."" these are the bands that gave the rise to emo, and I can assure you that Dashboard Confessional and New Found Glory have NOTHING to do with them. Sunny Day Real Estate and Elliott could be placed second generation emo, but this book seems to take emo as being MTV friendly. Emo was a child of punk rock not pop punk."
5,one of the best music books in years,"I don't know who these complaining reviewers are, but I doubt they have actually read this book. The ""emo"" scene is a tough one to crack as no one in it actually wants to be labeled emo. Maybe there lies the problem. However, any one who is a fan of this music will quickly see that this book was made for them! Great writing and obviously well researched, Greenwald captures this moment in the music industry where fans are actually turning out to see singers and songwriters based on their music not on their press releases.As for the reviewer who says Greenwald never mentions Sunny day Real Estate or Rites of Spring. Greenwald actually covers Sunny Day pretty well on pages 19-33 & Rites on pages 11-19. Sure there is a lot a whole lot of Dashboard stuff in the book, but they are the band making headlines across the world.Whatever you think about emo this is still a wonderful look at how the music biz works at the ground level and with bands just getting big."
2,soooo disappointing....,"i got this book in an attempt to educate myself on emo and punk origins. i've used those words sparinlgy in the past b/c i wasn't quite sure what they meant. this book however is extremely repetitous, all the way down to word choice. the writing style is just plain boring - don't be fooled by the large type b/c it still takes forever to read.this book did however give me some insight into the underground music world. it name-dropped like crazy so i wrote down the bands and did my own research. but other than that, this book was good for nothing. but nice try..."
1,Emo = Emotional Hardcore,"There is only one thing that Greenwald got right about this book: ""emo"" is a mocked and misunderstood term that has been around for 20 years. The big problem is, Greenwald contributes to the misunderstanding and mockery of ""emo"" with this book. Like many people who try to define and classify ""emo"", Greenwald's definition is completely wrong. So, you want to know the real definition of ""emo""? Its simple, ""emo"" is emotional hardcore. The important part of that definition is hardcore. If its not hardcore, than its not ""emo"". Reading about ""emo"" never really helps, so if you really want to understand ""emo"", listen to it. There are many good resources on the internet, just keep in mind that ""emo"" is emotional hardcore."
4,haha i lied the title for this book,"Well I enjoyed reading this book its basically this guy who writes for spin magazine and writes about early 90s ""emo"" bands. Im halfway thru the book and its hard for me to put it down cause im into this kind of music.Overall I gave this a 4 out of 5. Pick this up if you want to learn about the beginnings and some culture of punk-emo stuff!"
5,A lack of certainty does not outlaw knowledge,"A lack of proovable certainty does not mean that knowledge ceases to exist, it means instead that the relationship between a person and knowledge is more like a relationship between two people. Longing to Know suggests that what we view as ""reason"" (science, math) and what we view as ""faith"" or stuff outside the box (religion, and artistic talents) are really acts of coming to know with very similar major features. In other words, knowledge is a confidence (for example, that the floor will hold me when I walk on it; although I have confidence that the floor will hold me, the floor will not necessarily hold me) rather than a proovable certainty."
3,Not deep enough,"I bought this item to dress up my bag. Unfortunately, it doesn't allow my driver head to go dep enough. The head just gets past the mane. It still works, just not like I expected."
3,Sad picture of Prague,"This documentary introduces a darker side of Czech capital city. Prague is no longer a romantic place, with beautiful spots, beer gardens etc. It is a home to paid love, drugs and porn business, children abuse etc.The atmosphere presented here is quite heavy, pessimistic, pich black. While watching it I couldn't stop thinking that these boys are lost. I was also shocked by their attitude towards HIV/AIDS...That they are careless is way too delicate to say.There is one person who makes this movie even more depressing. It is the evil porn ""direcor"" who talks without any shame about his work, how he abuses those boys etc.But these were the scenes shot in the morgue that I found as very very disturbing. Even if W.Grodecki wanted to emphasize some matters, this part of the film is really sick.Otherwise, it is worth to see."
2,Body without a soul,"This was not the same documentary, but a watered down version. Many of the scenes where replaced with others. Without the graphic truth, the true nature of the problem is greatly diminished. I was greatly disappointed with this version of the film."
3,Really bitter reality,"The story is real, this is basically a documentary, so sad to know that this is based on true story, I just wish it could have done it in better ways."
2,More of a Documentary,"I was fairly disappointed. The central character, a porn-film director was somewhat self opinionated and irritating. Listening to him was not helped by having to read the English sub-titles. There are some rather cute Czech lads to look at, and you can sympathise with their (albeit self-induced) plight. Anyone looking for much nudity and sex however, will be disappointed.The film is more of a 'Talking Heads' Documentary, with very little action. There is a strange (and repellent) inclusion in the film, of what appears to be a very real post-mortem (the directors daytime occupation is a mortician ).The DVD will probably gather a little dust on the shelf, as it's not particularly re-watchable."
2,Who drilled these holes????,"When installing on our dock, we noticed that the holes drilled were just the opposite of how they should have been. We decided to redrill the holes correctly instead of returning this item, at our expense."
5,Great product! Cheaper from K2....,"This is an excellent item.....however you can get it $4 cheaper from the manufacturer, K2... Buy it...if you cook on the grill you wonder how you were able to do it without these!"
5,"Real World, Real Solutions","With bookshelves full of books written by instant managementMcGurus selling their own flavors of the month,""Embracing Uncertainty"" is a breath of fresh air. This book actually makes sense. It deals with the real world not theoretical models. If you enjoy reading academic mumbo-jumbo, this book is not for you.The old axiom:""the only sure things in life are taxes and death"" should be changed.It should read:""the only sure things in life are taxes,death and uncertainty."" You can cheat on your taxes, cheat death for a while, but you cannot avoid uncertainty. Embrace it!"
2,Ugh...,"Dear Jesus, be afraid of this video. I have a strong stomache, and no normal horror movie, fact or fiction, has ever been to horrible for me to withstand. Unit 731 is the exception. This is the only movie I have never been able to finish. The video of a young girl's arms being frozen and the flesh ripped off of them as she watches was awful. I didn't get farther than that. If you want to experience history and immerse yourself, I'd definitely say this movie is what you're looking for... completely, 100% inappropriate for anyone under the age of 14."
3,A Roman mystery,"A friend recommended Steven Saylor, and since this was the only one I found in my local book store this is the one I bought. Not a mystery fan actually I still found this book intriguing. The plot is set in acient Roma, and though alot of places the language is too modern to get the right feeling Saylor has also captured an ancient mode through the story.The plot takes a long time to reveale itself though and when I finally knew what the plot were all about the story went on and on with little happening. It might be my problem that I have not read any of the other books in the series, I really felt it hard to get to know Gordianus, the main character, the hero of the book. At the same time it is where Saylor writes about Gordianus and his family the book is at it's best.I still gave to book three stars though. The story really had something in it, and aspecially the surprisingly ending gave me satisfaction as a reader."
4,Venus Throw - Another Fine Pitch,"Saylor lives up to the high standard he set in the earlier Gordianus novels, delivering a novel with fascinating characters and an intricate plot, set against a deteriorating Roman Republic. More and more, though, one has to wonder if Gordianus is truly deserving of his ""Finder"" title; he seems to never discover the truth except by accident or divine intervention! Gordianus' forensic abilities aside, however, The Venus Throw is a highly enjoyable read, worth every penny."
4,More of Saylor's entertaining historical fiction--The Venus Throw,"More of Saylor's entertaining historical fiction--The Venus ThrowAt dice I sought the Venus Throw.Instead: damned Dogs--the lose-all low!--Propertius, ElegiesIV, vii: 45-46"
4,the venus throw,"As a student of Roman history, I really like Steven Saylor's series of books aboutGordianus, the Finder. I watch NCIS and the CSI shows on television and like that format, also. I find it amazing that without a crime lab, forensics, the internet and affiliated resources, the Finder is able to find the solution to the crime using just his intelligence and his wit.Along the way, the main character is associated with many of the great historical figures of the last days of the Roman Republic. The main characters in Gordianus' family are very believable and formidable. Saylor's research enables him to write a very thorough and very readable 'whodunit'.I have not read all the books in the series, yet. I plan to read them. This one was very enjoyable with a twist at the end that I did not expect."
5,Gordianus novels,The Gordianus novel series is one of the best collections that I have read in the last few years. I have them all now and can't wait to see what Steven Saylor does next. It is definitely worth reading if you are into mystery novels. A great read from beginning to end.
4,More than I needed to know...,Great fast read. This book surprised me. It was more erotic than the others and had a surprise ending. Wondering where Saylor is taking me next. Can't wait.
3,nana17,I have several of these units and they are great for crafting. I keep everything I have in all of these.
2,Poor Quality,"I purchased this as part of my toy chest that I was making for my son. This was the biggest partition/module that i was ablet o find that could contain some big toys. The end result looks good as my husband made lemonade out of the lemons. The dowels don't fit at all, the holes don't line up and generally it's very poor construction. If you are a handy person then it will give you a pretty good end result from a distance."
4,Good product,Bought four for record album holders. Easy to assemble (I also used a little white glue for extra strength). The only thing I didn't like we're the plastic plug for the screw holes. They didn't fit very well and didn't look good. I had some wood filler that matched so I used that instead. The finished product looks great and is very sturdy. I would definitely buy again if I needed a storage cube this size.
4,Wannabes,"Great movie reminds one of a Bronx tale; begins with narration and a pre-view of whats going to happen, I liked it enjoyed the camaraderie of the guys and the philosophy of brotherhood no matter what not seen these days. If you are like me a kockaround guy from the hood and have a few good memories of the O'le days you'll like this movie. If you are a young guy wanting to know how to get up in life you'll like it too and for you gal's there's some surprises 4 stars love or leave it."
3,Somewhat Informative,"The review by John below was excellent...I agree with pretty much everything he said...A lot of primary sources/data...But that's it......For one who knows nothing about ""soiled doves"" except what they see on tv or the big screen, this is a good book to read.....The corruption/""looking the other way"" interaction is what I found the most fascinating"
5,OUR FAVORITE FOR YEARS!,"We have had this book since my 13 yr. old was a baby. It then went through my now 12 yr. old son and my now 9 yr. old daughter. I now have a 19 month old son and am enjoying it with him. It's perfect for learning about themselves(""these are my eyes""), for cuddling(""these are my kisses"") and for bedtime(""and this is good night""). I have been looking for another copy of this book since my last baby was born because a page got ripped. It is now out of print. Where can we get another one?!?!?! WE LOVE THIS BOOK!"
5,The Best,Mas Romantico certainly lives up to it's name. The whole CD is quality work but I especially love Historia Entre Tus Dedos!! This CD definately belongs in your CD library!!
5,A Must Have!!,"I received this as a shower gift. I loved the idea of being able to get my daughter for night feedings without getting out of bed. This worked wonderfully! I loved the fact she was right next to me in arm's reach all night long. <br /><br />The only difficulty I found was getting in and out of bed with it there, but that was minor. The construction and detail that this possesses suggests a mother designed it. Everything is secured including the mattress pad in both the bassinett position and the playard position. It is well worth every penny!!!"
5,A definite must have!!,"I can't imagine not having had this product when our baby was a newborn. We absoultely loved it. Yes it is big but you can use it as a pack and play when your baby begins to pull up, we have just turned it into a play yard and it works wonderfully. I will admit that it was hard to put together the first time, but converting it to the play yard was a snap. I would reccomend this product to new parents any day. A definite must have!!!"
5,Absolutely the best thing for breastfeeding moms.,"Excellent product. I strongly recommend it for breastfeeding moms. It's really convenient when you need to feed the baby at night. All you have to do is reach out. Additionally, we have noticed that baby sleeps better at night when she sees and feels you. If you need to travel, you can take co-sleeper with you. It collapses to a very small size. We love it. A+."
2,Terrible to assemble,"After my husband and I put this together using the TERRIBLE directions, we've been using this as a free-standing bassinet for the past 5 months (not attached to the bed, as some people do). My daughter has been sleeping in it just fine. However, we attempted to fold it up to take it with us on a weekend away from home recently. What a nightmare to collapse! Again, the directions are of absolutely no help. It was impossible to get the whole thing into the carrying case and get it zipped up. Also, this thing weighs a ton. I now realize I need to buy something else to use when travelling. How annoying. Bottom line: if you're going to set this up and never take it down, it's fine (once you initially get it put together, that is). However, if you think you'd like to use this on an occasional overnight trip away from home, forget it!"
3,Good for a newborn,We ordered this for our 5 month old. It just didn't work for us at this stage. The mattress is not even with our bed which is what we were picturing. There is about a three inch barrier. When set-up it seems sturdy BUT taking it apart is VERY tough. This isn't because the directions are difficult but because the locking mechanisms are difficult to manipulate. This would never be a substitute for a portable pack-and-play.
3,how to clean,"We are having a 3rd baby after many years of needing baby supplies. I was excited to find this product and trusted that it is endorsed by Dr. Sears, whose books I read with my other children.So far the product seems to be what it advertised to be but...how the heck are you suppose to wash the sheet without taking the whole thing apart? Maybe we are missing something but it is extremley difficult to figure out how to wash the sheet without taking the thing halfway apart which is hard if it is up against your bed where it is suppose to be! I did manage to get a play yard sheet on it (sortof) but this also seems complicated.For the price I would expect it to be a little more user friendly and easier to clean!"
2,Not what I expected,"I got the original thinking that I would be able to nurse my baby while he was still in the co-sleeper. But you can't, you must lift the baby out of it, which completely wakes him up. He just ended up in bed with me, while the co-sleeper collected dust.I found assembly to be average. If you have a brain in your head, you can assemble this. It's not ""intuitive"" and I think that is what most people complain about.My son hated the play yard. But that is just him!Overall, I wish I hadn't gotten this, as it wasn't what I expected."
3,co sleeper,"I have not used mine yet because my baby is not ready to meet he world, but I have put it together. It was pretty easy to put together. The mattress is harder than I would prefer but we will see if she likes it."
1,putting together & taking apart worst than labor,"Putting this together and taking it apart was the worst thing about having a baby, worse that labor. Doing it over and over again through a few moves only made the awfulness more predictable, not easier. My gosh I have put together two strollers, two high chairs, a crib, a exersaucer, put in 3 car seats, and a changing table, and this was the worst by a HUGE margin. You will end up crumpled in a crying mess on the floor, likely more than once."
1,You will never use it,Please don't even waste your time or money with this product. We never ended up actually placing the baby in it because as its designed its difficult to place the baby in it from your bed after a midnight nurse. Our baby woke up immediately every time.
2,buyer beware,"We bought this for our newborn baby girl, I liked the idea of having her next to the bed and being able to reach in and comfort her or get her out to nurse without having to get up out of bed. First of all this was not so easy to assemble and was extremely difficult to disassemble and pack up. Our baby girl cried every time we put her in it, maybe because the mattress was very firm. I returned this because while we were sleeping I awoke to find the duvet part way in the co-sleeper. Later that night a pillow made it halfway in as well. If you use this, I would recommend only a light blanket on your bed and only a pillow for your head."
3,Maybe it's just me...,"Despite my best efforts, this does not sit flush with my bed. I bought the leg extender, so it is the correct height, but because I have a bed frame, there is about 2 inches between the cosleeper and the bed. Maybe it's just me, but I expected it to be flush with my bed so I could more easily get the baby in and out. This is a step up from the bassinet, but not as great as I expected."
5,I love it,"Best purchase ever!!!!!!! now I can sleep, and my baby loves his bassinet!!! is near to me, and the mattres is very comfortable for the baby so he sleeps more time and better!"
5,Love this!,"I absolutely love the cosleeper. We have used it for our daughter since she was a newborn, and it is still going strong at 16 months. As a newborn, we used the bassinet feature against our bed as a cosleeper. The bassinet feature was so wonderful to have;I didn't have to bend over to the floor after giving birth to pick her up. It was also really nice to be able to see her at night right next to me, but not actually be in the bed with us. Once our baby could kneel, we used it as a crib, a few feet away from our bed. Now that she is sleeping in her own bedroom, we still have it set up as a crib for her friends when they visit. If we hadn't received a crib as a gift, I think it would be a decent option as one. If you are looking for a true travel crib, the cosleeper is not quick to take apart and is heavy to transport. We have a top rated travel crib we love, but it is smaller, not sturdy, and I would not consider using it as a full-time crib."
5,Best Baby Product I Had,"Before my daughter was born I did not plan to have her in my room. But immediately, I found the idea of sending her off alone unthinkable. We were co-sleeping in the same bed for about a month, neither safe, or comfortable with a newborn. We mail ordered this co-sleeper and I was so pleased with it. I could have my daughter right there, very easy for nighttime nursing. I felt very calm and safe with her in the co-sleeper. She slept in it until she started to climb out at nine months, prior to that the regular crip in her room was just used for storage! This for me was hands down the best can't-live-without baby product that I used. I gave it to a friend for her baby, now I find myself with a surpize baby coming due and I am going to gladly purchase another Arm's Reach Co-sleeper. It's a must have!!!"
2,WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE,"We got the arms reach for our newborn twins and though it was tough to put together - sticky and unclear - we persevered and it was fine as a co sleeper - HOWEVER when we moved the twins to their cribs and wanted to change it to a pack and play our troubles began. It would not lock into place and was unsafe. I called the arms reach customer service 5 times and have not heard back. You cannot actually reach someone. Instead, they force you to leave a message and then do not return the phone call. I am left with a useless $200 item that is unsafe for my children. Get a real Pack and Play with the bassinet option. Other parents told me to do so and I wish I had listened."
2,"Great Idea, but with drawbacks","We have had the original Co-Sleeper for 2.5 years. Our first son slept in it for 2 months and then refused to sleep in it. Our second refused to sleep in it period (even padding it with a small quilt). I assume that they make it completely uncomfortable to help prevent SIDS (your baby might has well be laying on the floor because it is not padded very well at all). The fitted sheet cannot be dried in the dryer, which is inconvenient. Most of all, I hate assembling and disassembling this thing. I never complain about assembling toys, gadgets, playards, etc...but this thing is horrible. I actually beat it with a hammer when I took it down after my first child quit using it. It is now put away and I will never put it up again. The only good thing I will say about it is that it's extremely sturdy (probably why it's a pain to assemble). I would suggest scouting ebay, yard sales, and second-hand stores instead of buying a new one. It is not worth $200."
1,Way too difficult to be portable and poor sleeping surface,"I though it was just me but after reading several other reviews I see that others agree on just how difficult this thing is to assemble/disassemble. The locks are impossible, the items do not quite fit right, and it would be impossible to get this thing into its ""travel bag."" The mattress is thin and very lumpy; each fold in this mattress causes hard lumps. I bought this product thinking I could use it as a portable play yard after my baby out grows the co-sleeper aspect but there is no way. I recommend you avoid this product!"
2,I do not like it,We got this and a chicco play yard and my son does not like this as much as the chicco. The chicco appears to be softer to sleep on.
2,"""Mattress"" HARD (as in wood hard)","I really wanted to love this item, but 3 months into using it, I am not too keen on it. The mattress is really hard (I am not sure you can even call it a mattress), and now I am going to purchase one and spend an extra $50 or so. The so called mattress on the cosleeper consists of a thin pad of about 1 inch backed with a wood composite board. Considering the cost of the cosleeper ~$200, I think the mattress should be an actual mattress. The ""mattress"" it comes with gives once your baby gets to about 12-13lbs, basically having the baby sleep on the hard wood board. Specially the head.It is also a bit wobbly,the baby kicking or getting excited with her toys makes the entire cosleeper rock back and forth.I hope that it works better as a play yard, but by reading the reviews I am not so sure about that either. Basically I would not buy this item again or recommend it to someone else."
3,Heavy and bulky,I purchased one of these for my baby due in November because I thought it would be easy to use - to have a play yard and a sleeper in one. I was wrong! This thing is hard to put together and hard to take down - and there is no way I would even bother packing it around for a play yard - it's way to bulky and heavy!!The mattress it comes with is to hard so we had to purchase a portable crib mattress to put on top of the mattress it came with. I think I could of spent 150 dollars on other things for my baby.
3,Not Essential,"First, this is a high-quality product. However, now that my daughter is 3 months old, she is in her own room across the hall. This was quite a lot to spend on something that she has outgrown already. If you want a co-sleeper, I would recommend the mini. The original takes up half of the side of my bed which made getting in and out of bed very difficult, particularly in the first weeks after my c-section. I bought bed risers to make it tall enough next to my bed, and it was still awkward to bring my baby to bed to nurse.Also, you don't need the co-sleeper sheets; just buy general sheets for a play yard. They're cheaper."
5,Does what it says,This product does what it says - it remains by bedside - is sturdy - saves you getting out of bed when feeding and is comfortable enough for my baby who has been sleeping there for over three months. It is a little short but this is OK and is still safer than a normal bassinet.
3,Didn't work for us.,"I wanted this product to work for us, but I think the baby has slept in it only for a few hours here and there. We've finally converted it to an independent unit/play yard and it's in the living room. It's a useful place to put the baby to play every now and again, but that's it. I think it's a good idea, it just didn't work for us. My main complaint though is that it was one of the most convoluted things to put together!!!!"
4,Getting ready to use it again!,"We used the co-sleeper with my son for several months and it worked well for us. As he got a little bigger and I was worried he was too mobile, we moved him into the bed with us. Then it was nice to have in place because I didn't have to worry about him rolling out of the bed.I am now expecting a little girl in about 2 weeks. We've already gotten the co-sleeper prepared for the next user. It made all of the difference in the world for us and I can't imagine going without it!"
5,Solid construction,"I use this in my bedroom and a playpen in the living room. This co-sleeper is much more sturdy, doesn't wobble, and doesn't sag in the middle like the playpen."
4,Can't Live Without it!,"After 3 weeks of completely sleepless nights, we broke down and bought this for our daughter. She had to be touched to sleep longer than 15 minutes but my husband and I weren't comfortable putting her in bed with us. The very first night that this arrived was a wonderful night. We slept for much longer periods of time because I was able to put my hand on her while she slept and it made her feel secure. We now use it for our newborn son. I breastfeed and this makes my nights SO much more restful than if the baby were in his own bed. I simply scoop him into the bed with me, position him appropriately and nap until they are done. When they are done, they go back into the cosleeper and we all sleep soundly without ever really waking up. LOVE it and can't live without it!"
4,Love This!,We bought the co-sleeper instead of a bassinet due to it's flexibility. We decided to purchase the orginal co sleeper and use this as the babies main crib until the baby is ready for a regular crib. My complaint is that it is difficult to change from play pen to co sleeper the lock on the bar is hard to figure out and the instructions are pretty vague (this is why I give the co sleeper 4 stars). Over all it took me 20 minutes to set up and no tools required.
1,poor product,"I really love the idea of co-sleepers and I'm glad that we went with that option. Unfortunately, arms-reach was a disappointment. The product's quality is really poor. The ""mattress"" is a fold-able board with less than an inch of padding. The bed is also not usable as a play pen or travel bed because on the lower setting, the sleeping/playing surface is very uneven. There is a plastic stump in the middle. Because the mattress is so thin and wobbly, the four corners end up being significantly lower than the center part. Assembling and disassembling is a pain, and some fabric parts cannot be taken off to be cleaned.Go with another product if you can."
4,Works great if you can get past the frustrating setup,"I have both a Graco Pack N Play (PNP) as well as this co-sleeper. I bought this to use as a bassinet, as the PNP had a weight limit of 15 lbs, and the bassinet was sinking in the middle like many others report. This co-sleeper's bassinet has a weight limit of 30 lbs, which means she can sleep in our room a bit longer. Our baby is 13+ pounds and the mattress is firm and seems to be holding up so far. The reason why I'm deducting a star is that is was so frustrating to put together, much more so than the PNP. Setting up and collapsing the PNP is intuitive and a breeze in comparison to this thing. Not only was it not intutive, but the instructions are mediocre at best. I'm sure there's a reason for the cover and all that velcro, but holy cow it seems a little more complicated than it has to be. So I will probably use the PNP for travel and keep this in one place, like in our room or at grandma's when she is a bit older."
5,One of the best inventions,"This has to be one of the best baby gear product inventions in 20 years. PERFECT for the parent who is practical, wants to sleep safely near their newborn. Everyone gets more sleep with this product. The convenient pockets on the side allow you to keep diapers and wipes- no need to get out of bed at night. Our daughter was able to sleep in this for 5 months until she would roll over. I cannot recommend this enough. When they outgrow the bed it turns into a playpen- fantastic! The color is great too, who doesn't like ""natural""? Also, all the covers and linings are machine washable- super easy to assemble, disassemble, etc."
1,BEWARE OF SUFFOCATION,Just went to the ER today after I found my 4 month old with his face wedged in the corner.This co-sleeper is not safe once they can wiggle around at all. My 4 month old cannot roll over yet.He just started kicking his legs enough to move himself around. When I found him he was blue.He is fine now but I am getting rid of the co-sleeper!
1,I do not recommend this product!,"Although the premise of this product is fabulous, the manufacturer does not deliver a well executed unit.Difficult assembly is a minor detail as the mattress is as hard as a rock. UNLESS, you want to purchase the upgraded organic mattress for $150.00 and I didn't even spend that much on my crib mattress!Don't waste your money!"
2,Not really necessary,"I set up the co-sleeper with added leg pieces so that it's level with our bed. It's awkword because if you lay the baby in there lengthwise, it's really awkward to get him out at night. If you lay him in there sideways, then he's too big for it in about 2-3 weeks. The mattress is really hard, and the sheet sets are a fortune. My baby slept in it for 3 or 4 nights and refused to be left in it. Plus, having the cosleeper makes getting in and out of bed a pain. I'll be using it as a play yard once our baby gets bigger, I'm glad I got mine used instead of buying it new!A play yard with an infant sleeper would have been the same if not better!"
2,Hard to dissasemble,"Despite the fact that the product serves its purpose being a compact co-sleeper, I just cannot recommend it to my friends as it is very hard to dissasemble. Why not make it easier for an adult to operate (yet child-proof) so that it's easier to take apart?"
2,Should be great but wasn't for us,"This is a really great idea and should be a wonderful buy. We were really looking forward to using it. However, we didn't realise it was only for babies up to 3 months, and it proved to be just too big for our little 'un. He just couldn't settle in it, and after a few attempts, we had to use a bassinet instead. We'll still be able to use it as a playard, but that wasn't what we bought it for.I'd recommend getting the mini co-sleeper, one this big just seems a little pointless, as well as expensive"
2,Not worth the price,"I thought this product would be excellent for my newborn daughter. It seemed like a great way to keep her close for midnight feedings. However, it arrived without directions, was complicated to set up and take down, and doesn't seem to be that comfortable for her. It also makes it difficult to get out of bed due to its size and inability to move. I wish I would have read more reviews and purchased something less expensive."
4,Eye Opening,"This book does an excellent job of outlining the multiple accounts of what 46 doctors witnessed in 1960, after the African nation of Katanga had declared independence. The U.N. sent troops to ""keep order"". In time, the country was conquered and handed over to Congo. In the interim however, there were numerous atrocities that took place against innocent civilians. Eyewitness testimonies of these tragic events are given, as well as the letters that were written by the doctors in order to get the word out on what was happening & to seek justice against the perpetrators."
4,American history you should know,"An Civil War eminent historian demolishes the myths about carpetbaggers. The book follows 10 Northerners who became some of the more prominent leaders of the reconstructed South in the post-war era. Their actions belie the stereotypical story of greedy, slippery Northerners that was created to explain away the failure of Reconstruction after the North gave up on it. Read this book along with Eric Foner's masterpiece on the same subject.Highly recommended for anyone interested in the Civil War, the South, or race relations. To understand America you need to know the story of Reconstruction - and it is likely not the one you learned in school. A fascinating read."
2,Re-fashioned 007,Interesting attempt on the original scores but nothing beats the original. Some of the selections are downright weird. Buy only if you sincerely want another 007 type related item to your collection for the sake of aquisition.
4,salt & pepper,These are really pretty but I set them on top of the stove for easy access and they melted! I'm going to order the same ones but keep them on a shelf this time.
3,Exactly what you see,"My husband loved these shakers for their color, I wanted something simple and sleek. He won, now they sit in our kitchen, but add a little pizzaz to our table. Not too shabby."
1,packaging on this item sucks.,"These items were shipped in a huge box with no padding. The salt shaker (which was filled) leaked massive amounts of salt all over my front porch and my house when I brought the box in. Yes, having these filled is a nice touch. But sealing them before shipping and actually using packing material would have been much nicer."
3,"Nice, but not long lived","I've owned 2 sets of these. Both sets came apart after about a year of use. The glue used to join the different colored pieces obviously is not strong enough. I also have experienced drying out of the rubber stopper in the salt shaker, as noted by another reviewer."
1,Thompson colored acrylic salt and pepper shakers,"I was so happy to discover these as my original one piece colored acrylic salt and pepper mill was lost. However, I am greatly disappointed in this product. The salt shaker broke in two pieces after less than a month's use and the pepper mill followed a few months later. Poor poor quality and craftsmanship. I would never purchase these again."
2,Came unglued,"The S&P shakers are beautiful and I have received many compliments about their color. However, after using them a handful amount of times- the salt shaker body separated."
4,Great Salt and Pepper Set.,"This is a very colorful, fun salt and pepper set. Make my table look festive and the peppermill works great!"
4,Wonderful book!,"The book has a number of wonderful Spanish recipes, representing every re would have been more helpgion of the country. It is organized by region. It would have been more helpful is the chapters were organized by functional sections (e.g., ""appetizers"", ""main dishes"", etc.), as it can be a bit challenging to have to look through each section if you're interested in creating a meal with dishes from more regions than one."
5,excellent variety and geographical background,great colors and smells and tastes come from this book. i enjoyed learning abou the regions and their foods. they taste great too.
3,Nice Grill but.......,"I've used this pan 4 times now for burgers, steak and chops and the end results have been excellent. Nice char and flavor each time. The only thing holding me back from 5 stars is the tremendous amount of smoke it produces! Last night we cooked 2 ribeyes and the kitchen was socked in by the proverbial London fog! Grant you our exhaust hood is not the most efficient but it would have taken a large commercial fan to deal with the smoke. So after silencing the smoke detectors and opening all the windows, we sat down to some very nicely done steaks. Am I doing something wrong?"
1,exploding pan,"This pan had a defective casting. It was used to grill a peice of salmon....and exploded on the stove the first time it was used. A peice of the side of the pan just cracked and broke away.The casting is very light, not like older cast iron pans and the pan was not overheated to cause this. It was defective.This could be a serious safety hazard."
3,Lodge Logic 11-1/4-Inch Pre-Seasoned Grill Pan,The product is not that bad. I'm having a hard time of cleaning the pan. It doesn't remove the dirt even I didn't use any soap. I only used hot water and the stain remains.
2,Seasoned?,"Well I was finally getting my first grill pan.Oh boy was I suprised.It is very heavy and bulky with no ample handle support.The handle gets very hot as with all cast-iron pans.Mine arrived chipped due to Amazon's excellent packing and packaging support.It was surrounded by paper and was able to move around the oversized box.Now it says it is ""Pre-seasoned"",but that was a load of crock.Even when I used olive oil before cooking everything I made in it stuck to the ridges and had to scrape the bits of charred food off with a metal spoon.It also created so much smoke I had to give up smoking cigarettes when I use it.Both were Cancerous.I do not recommend this pan,go out and by a better one or at least one that is really seasoned."
1,This pan is poorly designed,"Bottom line : if you are looking for a grill pan, this unit is not it. The ridges are sharp, too high, and not rounded. At best it steams the meat, maybe more healthful vs. less oil?. Meat sits too high above the heat base and juices. Hence it pumps out atomized oil and vapors like a chimney, not good. I have had much better results with an anodized aluminum square grill pan(reason for trying a cast iron grill pan), but refuse to use aluminum long term (not healthy). Best!! results are with my standard flat bottom cast iron pan. After a 2 weeks, went back to the flat pan and the meat is much much more flavorful. Don't waste you money. I have to wonder about some of the other reviews here (bad cooks? phonies?), it is obvious per stated design this pan is A DOG!"
3,GramGram,Got this for my son which is all about healthy eating. I love iron skillets they are a lifetime investment. Don't know if I would buy one with the grooves in it though. It does keep the food up and away from grease. Haven't heard much about it from him though.
1,Impossible to clean! A waste of money!,"I used this pan once, and that will be the last time, because even after scrubbing and scrubbing I STILL cannot get this pan clean!I bought this grill pan thinking it would be a healthy alternative to just frying food in a skillet... but apparently you're supposed to use a ton of oil on it so it doesn't stick. So where is the health benefit in that?!I am so unsatisfied."
2,Item sent not as pictured,"I ordered this grill pan with ridges on it, but amazon sent me a plain pan with no ridges, so beware."
3,A little disappointed!,"I purchased this skillet griddle to grill vegetables and steaks on my stove top! But vegetables (eggplants & Zuccinies) kept sticking to the grill and didn't cook the way they would have been on the Barbecue! Steaks also were sticking to the pan and they didn't cook so great, either! I think the lines on the pan are too narrow and tall and the food does not get a good contact with the surface of the pan and comes uncooked! I am a little disappointed! May be I am not familiar cooking with it.I tried to clean the food that were stuck and burned in between the griddles; but couldn't clean it very well. I didn't try too hard!"
5,cast iron grill pan,This is a versatile piece of cookware which I use on the stovetop and in the broiler. It is much better than the traditional two piece broiler and requires no turning. It was well seasoned when I got it so cleaning is a breeze.
3,"Cooks great, bear to clean.","I bought this pan to cook burgers and steak. It makes great grilling marks and the fat runs down into the bottom of the pan where it won't soak into the meat.The downside? Typical Lodge small handle, and it's a bear to clean. Despite seasoning per instructions, the pan needs a scraper to clean out between the ridges."
1,need guidelines for using this pan,"My latest Foreman grill is worn out, and I bought this pan as a possible replacement. In three tries so far, though, I haven't been able to cook anything well. The pan is either too hot, and the char marks are too burned and the food sticks to the pan while being underdone, or, in trying to lower the heat, there are no char marks and the food gets overcooked and dry. Obviously, I'm doing something wrong, but there were no general guidelines about pre-heating the pan, ""greasing"" the pan"" (I tried PAM, but any of that just runs down the side of the grids), how long what should cook, etc., etc. I'll tackle it again in a few weeks when things slow down, but in the meantime, I'm still using my aging Foreman"
5,Christmas Present,"product received was as advertised, and in great condition. Would buy from this vendor again."
3,Excellent first impression - quite disappointing afterwards,"The otherwise perfect recording of this wonderful Schnittke's work is spoiled by the accent of the singers - you just drift away thinking that the performance is perfect until the first grave mispronounciations of the Russian words that spoil everything.The Russian text in the booklet first surprises you by the use of the authentic old Russian orthography, but, similarly to the impression produced by the singing, at a closer inspection, it turnes out that spelling mistakes occur litetally in every second line, which gravely spoils the impression the booklet produces.This cd produces an excellent first impression - but unfortunately it is extremely far from the excellence of performance which this wonderful music calls for."
1,Looking To Make Soap? Be Prepared To Have Problems,"Well, I'm a beginner at soap making, and this book wassupposed to substitute for the lack of soap making classes in my area. I am very dissappointed. The author assumes that everyone who cooks makes everything from scratch, not boxes with packets of seasoning the way I do. Tell me, does anyone use double-boilers these days, and a mortar and pestle?I've never heard of these ""common"" everyday cooking utensils before this book. Second,essential oils are VERY costly, (especially rose, and jasmine) so if you don't carry lavendar, sweet orange, lemon oil, lemongrass, lime oil, cedarwood, etc..be prepared to spend a lot of money.The saving grace for this book is that it shows you the basics for making whipped cream soap, and luckily you do NOT need to use any of the ingredients for the sixty soap recipes in this book.You can use any essential oil for that. I therefore give this book a 1."
2,my opinion,"I bought the book because of the title, ""natural handmade soap from your kitchen"". You sure can't make any of these soaps from stuff you ""already"" have in your kitchen. There are a lot of supplies you cannot find locally you will have to do lots of mail order to complete these soaps. It was not what I thought it was. A nice book if you already have tons of soap making supplies and essential oils and dried flowers, but the ordinary person couldn't make these recipes easily."
3,Collect your ingredients!,"I have been wanting to get into soapmaking for awhile and received this book for Christmas. The recipes look fairly simple to make - they call for soap flakes - with the addition of various scents, colors, and exfoliants. However, while simplifying the soap making process, it makes up for it in adding other ingredients. Collecting the ingredients to make any one recipe would require an initial investment. Most recipes call for 3-5 different flavors of essential oils, with other ingredients thrown in such as rosewater or green clay. The pictures and layout are very attractive - you should just know what you're getting into."
4,Dark and Mysterious yet an incredible adventure!,"This is a bigger step up from the previous Sly Cooper game. There is no pattern, but since the goal is to retrieve the Clockwerk parts, there does not need to be. Also, will the spice shipments and Neyla showing up, this game also feels like a mystery. Health is WAY better than the first Sly Cooper game. The field mission are more complex, and this game has been the first time I ever experienced those. I will admit, there are at least a few objectives I'm not proud of like the rolling log game or the paragliding on the destroyed blimp, but as long as I get my adventure, then this is a really good game."
1,Where is the fun?,"I am massively dissapointed. Thievious Racoonus was really fun. Band of Thieves starts you out in a dark dark room where you can't see anything and can't figure out how to get out of. After 30 minutes of trying to beat the first challenge, I had to give up. Where's the fun? I wish I could get my money back."
1,sly 2 band of boringness,"this game sucks!!!!!! one hit from an enemy you die. You can't swim or anything either. I give 1 for the way they made the game, graphics, and story."
5,Great,"Sly 2 is more of the same of Sly 1 which is fine with me because I love the first game. I think the first was bit better though. I could be wrong, but I think the controls were tighter in the first and the camera moved better. The game is more difficult which could either be a good thing or a bad thing. Some people like easy games.Graphics: 5.0Control: 4.0Sound: 5.0Fun Factor: 5.0"
5,Sly Cooper is Sly! (Excuse the pun),"Sly Cooper is one of the best games ever! Basically you play asSly: Pick-Pocketing, Cane Moves, Climbing, and smoke bombs.Bentley: Sleep Darts, Mines, Bombs.Murray: Punches (basically thats all but different (fun)) kinds.This game begins with the gang trying to steal back Clockworks parts. Sly finds out that the Klaww Gang has stolen them. Sly sets out on a mission to get them back and this time, with the help of his friends!"
5,"Sly 2, The return of Clockwerk!","Here is some tips on bosses,Dimitri, he got the beat, he's mad! once he done with his powersgive him the old one~twoRajan, he's ticked off! Murray, you get the high jump, you needto not get shocked from the heart staff!Contessa, she's twice the battles, when she falls off, take a run! and there are two battles!Jean~Bison, you probably will get a tip before Brains vs. Brawndid I mention DYNAMITE!!!Arpeggio, well, Constable Neyla/Clock~la kills him so he'sreplaced by Neyla and you thought wrong, Neyla is BAD!Well those are some helpful tips, so get back on the controllerand read what I told you!"
5,Sly Cooper Band of thieves,"Received shipment just 3 days after I placed my order,WOW! Game was in perfect condition and are enjoying it! Thanks"
5,Sly Cooper 2: Band of Theives,"Sly Cooper 2 is one of the best games ever! Unlike most games, it actually holds my attention! One extreme high-point is the binocucom, because you don't spend frustrating hours being lost. Sly 2 is full of various missions, and has okay mini-games. Sly 2 rox my sox!"
2,Sly 2 Review,"The game was not in good condition. Certain parts of the game refuse to load due to excessive damage to the back of the game, making it impossible to take further action in the game."
2,"Not a Locket,...Cute but Cheaply Constructed","I bought this ring as a gift for a niece who likes turtles. I was charmed by its appearance, with little movable legs and head. I was very disappointed that those charming appendages fell off when I tried to open ""the locket."" Don't waste your money and time like I did."
4,This is a really neat AND educational book for kids,"This would make a really interesting fun and teaching tool for today's kids. Much of the setting, terminology, etc can be used to teach children on school life back at the turn of the 20th century, yet it is still a fun story children's story about honesty, caring for others, etc"
1,Didn't work with my Blackberry - Update below.,"I was pretty sure this should connect to my blackberry pearl using bluetooth, which it did, but nothing good happened after that. Just gave me this error - Signal too weak to pinpoint location. I tried my best to get it to work from a variety of places during different times of the day- but it's a useless piece of plastic now.My GPS device is from MS Streets and Trips 2007.Update: It started working after Google Maps were updated. Still has trouble occassionally with syncing BT, but overall I am ready to give it 4 stars."
3,Does not work while charging,I bought this because it was recommend by microsoft for use with Streets and Trips. As already mentioned it does not work with Streets and trips on Vista. It does however work well with Garmin PC. A few things I'm not happy about. The blue led is to bright when you have the unit on your dash at night and it does not work while you are charging it... very annoying.Update: The unit does not work while charging until the battery has been charged for 15 minutes after being fully discharged.
4,Surprisingly great!,"I must admit that I was skeptical from the very beginning but I decided to try this anyway. I'm using it with MS Live Search (which is free) and my T-Mobile Wing. After pairing with your phone, type in a location using Live Search, then click on route/maps/menu and finally ""Center on GPS"". It even works inside my house. The only reason why I didn't give this a perfect rating was because it doesn't come with a wall charger and you have to download Pharos' Ostia software ($120) if you want voice ""turn by turn"" directions. For $80 dollars this is definitely worth it."
1,Can't use with MS Streets and Trips 2007,"Would be great if it could link with the MS-Streets and Trips 2007. I bought the USB version as part of the Streets and Trips and thought it would be excellent to BT to the GPS receiver. So I bought it, but I cannot select the ""right"" com port in Vista."
2,Does not work as advertised,"Attempted to use this with the Microsoft branded Pharos GPS-500. The bluetooth stack on my Lenovo T61p sees the device and takes the passcode, but the sled never binds with the bluetooth stack. As a troubleshooting step I tried to bind the unit to my Windows Mobile 6.0 phone and the same results. The BT stack sees it but the device won't pair with the phone.I called Pharos and thier support agents will only tell you its a problem with Vista and Microsoft knows about it, they will then tell you to download a piece of nagware to test. Using this software confirms what I already know, and that is that the sled won't pair and Pharos response is that it can't be thier problem, it has to be a Vista/Microsoft problem. This is hardly possible as I use this machine and its bluetooth stack all the time to connect to mice and headphones, so I had no recourse but to return the unit."
3,Awesome Game - With one exception,"This is one of the best strategy games that I have every played. It sucessfully combines world domination with micro management of troops. There is certainly room for improvement, however, this is the best yet. I played it with a passion for a few weeks.The flaw...I was so excited at playing the campains I wanted to play with a friend. You cannot imagine my disappointment when I discovered that you can only play the battles over LAN. I was so insensed that I gave up the game. If I have one suggestion for the manufacturers of the game it is to make it playable over LAN/Internet, with the global domination aspect still intact."
3,not bad for a little while,for the price it's worth buying. don't waste you money on the follow up Rome. game are supposed to get better not worse. If your bored at 3 am it's worth playing for a few hours.
3,Okay,"This harness didn't work as well as I thought it would. It can be a pain to get on, and my dog usually tries to run away when he knows he is going to have to put it on even though he really wants to go for the walk. He also still pulls, but maybe not as much as if he didn't have it. He is stubborn and doesn't even seem to notice the harness if he decides to go after something. I do still use it and it has been a year, but if he had a regular collar he would choke himself so I am kind of stuck."
2,I love sporn generall but this was badly described,"I have several sporns for other dogs -- and even the one with the front net for THIS dog. But this 'small' regular sporn has a collar FAR too small for my pug and it's useless for her. I will simply donate it to a shelter (the shipping would be almost more than the cost of the halter). But I'm getting a bit cranky about things that are not fully described. These descriptions need MEASUREMENTS. Like the collar is X-inches long! In this case ""weight"" does not help -- the collar is far far too small to go around her neck and there is almost no leeway to adjust it at all.I love the sporn concept, and I hate to leave a crummy review -- but even the picture is misleading -- on a standard poodle the width of the collar would be appropriate. But on a small dog it's the SAME 1.25"" wide collar as is used on the large and extra large so it's way too wide on her neck as well as too short -- I shouldn't have believed the picture!!!"
3,Good product..wrong size.,"Needed a larger size. Returned and love the product...works best for a smaller dog. Will continue to use the ""Halti"" on larger dogs."
2,"too big,and too fragile",I purchased this model of Steinhausen this one in particular the crystal easily broke. also the Italian fake leather would fall the pin having an opportunity to loose your watch. this is a Chinese watch with a Swiss name.Does not support the money you pay for it.I would NOT recommend this watch.
5,TRACK LISTING,"The Lamplighters : Ride Jockey RideThe Five Jets : Please Love Me BabyBig Jay McNeely : Nervous Man NervousRoy Byrd : Rockin' With FesThe Midnighters : Rock, Granny, RollJoe Tex : She's MineBig John Greer : Come Back Uncle JohnRudy Moore : Step It Up And GoBilly Gayles : Do Right BabyJackie Brenston : Much LaterTiny Topsy : You Shocked MeBig Daddy & his Boys : Bacon FatLittle Willie John : SpasmsCecil McNabb, Jr. : Clock Tickin' RhythmBoyd Bennett & his Rockets : MoveHank Ballard : BroadwayTiny Topsy : Miss You SoRonnie Molleen : Rockin UpOtis Redding : Fat GalHank Ballard & The Midnighters : Nothing But GoodEddie Clearwater : A Real Good TimeBa Ba Thomas : Miss Shake ItBa Ba Thomas : Why Don't You Leave It AloneLittle Willie John : You Hurt Me"
5,addictive listenable dance music,"I personally don't like repetitive boom*tch-boom*tch-boom*tch type of music that goes on for 10 minutes, erlende oye does a great job of selecting songs that are catchy but doesn't get played out easily. Maybe I'm biased too, i like kings of convenience and royksopp, but this album is very upbeat, funky, yet diverse (Phoenix, Avenue D). There's no categorizing it, electro, house, pop, it's just good catchy beats."
5,A fun and eclectic mix to share with fellow music geeks,Finally a remix compilation that is suitable for people who don't really love dance music. I became aware of Erland Oye after falling in love with Royksopp's CD on which he did vocals for several tracks. The CD has a very retro 80's early 90's club sound to it. Many of the tracks feature the DJ singing over the songs which actually works quite well. The songs Drop and If I Ever Feel Better are worth the price of the CD alone. Also notable is a hilarious song 2D2F which has to be heard to be believed. Many of the tracks on here are derivative but overall the CD is just a lot of fun to play at a party. I can't recommend it enough to fans of 80's synthpop and modern chilled out lounge pop.
4,Outstanding,"This album is a compilation of songs from different artists, included Erlend Oye (mostly) and his Kings of Convinience band, remixed in an outstanding downtempo-house mood."
3,average,"I've read a few reviews of this album which sing its praise. It is just ok to me. I really like Erlend's work w/ Kings of Convenience & Royksopp, so I was anxious to hear this. I think the album was good through track 6, and then it bacame a turn off for me. I wasn't at all impressed with his adding of vocals over tracks like ""If I Ever Feel Better"" and ""Lullaby""...to me, those tracks are pretty much classics that need no tampering. This could have been a great album...and not that it's bad...I just wish he would have left some of his own stuff off and let the tracks stand on their own."
4,Good true Crime,This is a good book that tells a true story without getting too technical in the court room part (which I find many true crimes to do). It was interesting even if you knew the story and the outcome. Still some unanswered questions.
5,PAGE-TURNER,"WHAT A STORY! DEFINATELY WORTH READING, ESPECIALLY FOR TRUE CRIME READERS. THIS IS ONE OF THE BETTER TRUE CRIME BOOKS THAT I HAVE READ FOR AWHILE. THIS AUTHOR IS GOING TO BE ANOTHER ANN RULE."
2,Far too repetitive,"This book started out strong, then fell apart. A good 50 pages could have been trimmed for repetition and to help keep up the pace. The case itself is fascinating. The cause of death was so diabolical that it'd be almost too far-fetched if it were fiction. Truth, of course, is always the stranger of the two. I wanted to like this. There were some great flourishes and occasionally strong writing, but it just didn't hold up from start to finish. In the end, my recommendation is this: If you're tight on time and looking for a truly solid true crime, skip this one. If you're a true crime junkie, it won't lessen your library, and the case on its own is worth learning about."
2,Not for me,"As I always say, I don't like to tear a book down, just because I did not like it means nothing and I don't like swaying anyone else. That being said, short and sweet here.........I love True Crime, I did not love this book. It started out well then just flopped about 100 pages in. I found the author very repetitive in her writing, retelling details again and again. It took me weeks to get through this. I finally wound up skipping towards the end just to see what the verdict was."
3,Not for preschoolers,My 4 year old loves the Highlights magazine especially the Hidden Pictures but this book does not have the pictures of the objects to look for. One must be able to read to enjoy this book.
5,Black and white pages are great!,I just had to write in after reading the reviews of people complaining that the pages are black and white. Apparently they are not really thinking of the added benefit and extra fun this gives to the book. It can be a COLORING BOOK also! That's how I use it. It adds extra fun to the seek and find by the excitement of coloring in the item once you find it and then coloring in the rest of the picture once you have found all the items. It is better than a plain ole' coloring book because there is the added intellectual element of the seek and find. I'm glad it is in black and white and would choose the black and white over similar colored books everytime.
2,not what I was looking for,i was looking for preschool aged hidden pictures. He could not find the items because he is not able to read.
2,"Ok info, but nothing new. Better editing would help.","I was underwhelmed. The info was Ok, but nothing new was to be found. The format was awkward, with most paragraphs starting with a heading which was then also the first line.There are better books around."
5,MAMA'S BOY!,My husband and I have been loyal degree users ever since it appeared in our city. It's the best deodorant I have ever used and my husband is sold on it forever. I haven't smelled him from the moment he started using Degree and it's been great.We would love to have the Mama's Boy doll. We think it's great.If it's possible to have one I would love to know how to get one. Thank You Degree for a smell free marriage!
5,"excellent, doable","unlike Bryan Kest's, where after a few minutes, I was so winded I had to switch off. I think this video will help me work up to doing B Kest's Power Yoga energise, because it is a) not too long - 40 minutes and b) gives ATTAINABLE beginner's instructions - unlike BK where the less flexible are still way out of my reach - ha!Her instructions are concise and clear, anyone reasonably fit could handle this video, and the beginner's versions make it ok for people who aren't that flexible. And it gives one good workout!"
3,"Good, But Could Be Better!","I was slightly disappointed with the Power Yoga workout. I thought it was going to provide a well-rounded workout, focusing equally on all body parts but it doesn't. Additionally, I agree with the reviews that state it is not for beginners... the positions have no previews and it's difficult to watch the instructor while doing the movements."
1,Pass on this one,"I have been practicing yoga for a year - approximately three times per week. I was looking for videos to use for the days I can't make it to my yoga class.Like many others who have commented on this video, I worked out in a gym, took aerobics, step class, etc. for many years. I checked into yoga after suffering a knee injury.If you're looking for a fitness type workout and have never tried yoga, you will probably enjoy this video. If you know anything about yoga and practice with a good yoga instructor, you will hate this video. Not enough time is spent on proper form, and I found the instuctor to be annoying. Don't push yourself to do the advanced postures unless you have stretched beforehand. Not enough information on form is provided to make this a safe workout for beginners."
1,"Jerky movements, no finesse, Valley-Girl commentary","I found this tape aggravating enough to donate it, after one use, to the Salvation Army. It is very disconcerting to hear things like, ""Relax your butt!"" from a yoga instructor. There's not much fluidity in how the postures fit together and the instructor sounds about as soothing as Moon Unit Zappa did performing ""Valley Girl."""
3,Not for beginners,The standing postures are advanced. It is ok for a change. The tape is not very motivational.
1,questionable cover asana!,"I haven't viewed this video so please ignore my rating (the site won't let me not rate it), but I feel compelled to point out that the instructor on the cover is doing a sloppy and potentially knee-damaging version of warrior 1 position. Her right knee should not extend forward beyond her toes; her left foot should be completely connected to the ground! (Or if she lacks the flexibility, she should be doing a *safe* adaptation of the posture.) For me, this speaks to the quality of the yoga on the video."
4,Great addition to any fitness regimen!,"This is a good workout that will leave you feeling strong, completely stretched out, relaxed, and clear-headed. It's wonderful after spending the day hunched over your desk or after doing other sports that leave you with tight, sore muscles. It improves posture and helps you to release tension."
3,Not what it seems by the cover..and thats good!,The cover of this yoga workout is very deceiving to the more detailed eye...in that the posture of the woman on the cover is terrible in so many ways...the pose is way out of alignment for the knees and back and feet are not even on sure grounding. Why that pose in such a way I don't know because the workout is actually just the opposite. There are three people..showing modifcations..the woman on the cover leads it. Overall it works slower than I imagined and its not bad at all. While the workout is not for me and my own pace...its good for others. Its a little too talky for me...its difficult to be looking at the camera...do the excercises and que everyone including yourself...this can get the instructor and the viewer a bit stuck. its beyond me why and how they did not see how not yoga aware that picture is. But if you want to check it out do so...its cheap on ebay...about a $1.00 I've seen it for... don't be deterred right away by the cover.
3,A nice collection of B&W knotwork,"Not really what I thought it might be, that is to say, a collection of examples on how a bit of art MIGHT be decorated or how to plan that out. Instead, it's a cool collection of art pieces that ARE borders and decorations. Not so good if you are trying to design your own, but nice to look at and from which you might gain inspiration on your own projects.This book might be more accurately titled ""A Collection of Courtney Davis' Celtic Borders & Decoration""."
5,Grandson Loved This,"I purchased this for my 11 year old grandson. He is a skateboard enthusiast and he just loved this necklace. I surprised him with it as a ""just because"" gift and it brought a big smile on his face. Its made very well and worth the money!"
2,"Interesting, but short.",It seems to be a trend for authors to write a hundred page book. For example; VC Andrews and now Jackie Collins. Please stop this. It would seem that you are trying to nickel and dime us readers. Then a reader finishes this book (quickly) and has to wait for the new one to be published. I ask only that you write books with substance that we can really get into not these brief interuptions.
1,Linzer Cookie Cutter,"I have many Kaiser products and have been happy with all of them until I ordered the Linzer Cookie Cutter. It was nothing but tin and neither my husband nor me could get the pieces back together on the star one once we took it apart. The others eventually went back together however, can't imagine baking the cookies and having to spend such an exorbitant amount of time working on the cutters. Seems to me Kaiser could have produced a better product that would be user/baker friendly."
3,Disappointing,"This does not come in a storage tin as shown in the picture. Also, not all of the cutters were the same as described. I used them but will look for something else for the future."
1,not what expected,"This didn't come packaged as expected, per the picture. For what I received, I should have bought the cheaper version, but I was trying to buy ""prime"" and this seller was the first one listed. The packaging was just a plastic bag that looked old and beat up. For $28 it should have decent packaging. One of the cookie cutters was in pieces, not sure it will work correctly. Another has a dent. Definitely not worth the money, pick the cheaper ones listed."
4,weight tree,"I just recently baught this weight tree since i had a weight bench and I needed a place to put the 400 lbs. besides the floor. The the weight tree does hold that much weight and could hold more, the only thing I do not like is that it does bend in a little, when you put the max weight on a slot. But it does its job!"
4,good tree,"it it a great weight tree for the price, the material could be thicker, but it works fine. i dont think it is too great because if you have a lot of 45 pound plates, they won't fit or be supported by this tree. overall it is pretty good, i had some trouble putting it together, however i eventually got it. shipping was a bit slow. i would reccomend for you to look at other weight trees such as the A frame weight trees. look at it on amazon - http://www.amazon.com/Barbell-Standard-Plate-Rack-Black/dp/B000A6V5CG/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8"
3,it's ok,the language seems to be a bit too complicated. i picked this out for my son and feel like we'll have to wait a few years for him to listen to these stories.
3,for a younger demografic,Think I read this years ago when I was a kid. Still fun to read and not as scary now
4,8 REASONS FOR CROSS-DRESSING,"Vern L. Bullough & Bonnie BulloughCross Dressing, Sex, & Gender(Philadelphia, PA: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1993)(Library of Congress call number: HQ77.B785 1993)This is a comprehensive book on cross-dressingfrom mythological times into the early 1990's.Every reason for cross-dressing is included:1. transsexualism; 2. homosexuality; 3. heterosexual sex-scripts;4. theater; 5. stage impersonation of the other sex;6. lesbians who wanted to 'marry' other women;7. women who wanted the advantages of living as men;8. drag queen prostitutes.Once the various reasons for dressing in the clothes of the other sexare better understood and distinguished from one another,greater clarity will emerge.For the present, this may be the best comprehensive book.No general theory of cross-dressing is offered.This book basically reports the history of cross-dressing.Discover other books in this Internet bibliography:""Cross-Dressing Bibliography"".James Leonard Park."
2,The Lodge Pro griddle is better,"Why? No loop handles on the pro griddle. Why does it matter, well the handles make it too long to fit inside your oven, or ontop of your stove.If you are running a camp, maybe these handles are the better way to go, for the rest of us, get the Lodge Pro griddle instead."
4,Pre-seasoned??,"Great grill, but after you follow all the instructions, add this info: pre-heat the grill and then coat it well with good canola oil. Then lightly coat the food you're cooking, too. I had a big mess to clean when I didn't do this. Great for rainy days when cooking outside doesn't work."
3,smallish surface space-uneven heat,"The logic griddle did two things I wanted--put grill marks on my food and didn't stick. However, the surface was not as large as I had hoped for in a griddle that spans two burners. Two good sized pancakes don't really fit across it, and if you use the entire surface, the items in the middle between the burners don't get as much heat and cook unevenly.I have taken this griddle to Vermont and used it on a gas range, as well as on my smooth-top electric range at home. It works about the same on both.I was able to make professional looking panini sandwiches with nice grill marks and no sticking.My pancakes cooked unevenly and had to be watched very vigilantly.I gave the griddle 3 stars because it is preseasoned and food did not stick and it basically does what is says it does, although my expectations led me to hope for more."
5,wonderful necessity!,"We have a large family and when it is time to make french toast, need a lot of room! This griddle is a little narrower than others, but it fits our stove top well and is lighter and easier to deal with than others. It was only 29.96 when I purchased it... the price fluctuates from that to $49."
4,Great grill -- cleanup takes time,"This grill heats up quickly, and sears the meat beautifully. It has adjustable height and temperature controls, which makes it very versatile for all types of veggies, sandwiches and meats. My only complaint is that the grill plates aren't removable for easier cleaning. It took less than two minutes to cook the steaks to perfection; however, it took 10 minutes plus to thoroughly clean the grease from between the depressions on the lower grill plate. The top plate was much easier to clean because the depressions are very shallow. So, if you don't mind the cleanup, this is a great indoor grill."
3,Difficult to follow,"The message is a great one if the person watching is able to read the fast paced subtitles. The adults in the group had no difficulty, but some of the youth were unable to keep up with the written dialogue."
5,Highly Effective,"B.Z., Thankyou for a wonderful film. Your attempt to bring understanding to the public about complexities children in the MEast face was amazing. Yet the kids themselves carried the film so well. Please keep it going. Theirs more to be done. Support for your next work should be no problem. I will promote this film to others. Many thanks to you, your group and the kids in this film. May your truth prevail."
4,the future of the middle east,"this movie was very good. everyone should see it because you don't know what it is like to live there, but these kids bring you alot closer to understanding. the children in Israel and Palestine are the future of the middle east and through them there is hope."
1,"DVD case correct, Wrong DVD inside!!",We placed an order for a DVD called Promises. The item's case was correct but the wrong DVD was inside. Very disappointed. We needed to return it and receive a full refund which was great!!
2,An Anti-Jewish Biased Film,"This documentary is clearly biased in favor of the Palestine cause and tries to manipule spectator's feelings.The filmakers use different tricks to make spectator feels that Israelis are bad and Palestines are good, that Jewish tradition is male-chauvinist and irrational and Palestine tradition is feminist and cultured, that Israeli soldiers are terrorists and that Palestine terrorists are freedom heroes.A reflection included in this film is that we are biased according to where we are educated, but it can't be said that it is a revolutionary one.In short, a good film if you are interested in studying how filmakers use their work to support their biases, not a good film if you want to know the truth about the Israeli-Palestine conflict."
3,Pagination and Spelling,"This might be advertised as ""typeset for the Kindle,"" but the pagination and spelling are off in numerous places. (I know that this is written in 18th century prose--those aren't the 'errors' I'm referring to.) I encourage someone at Amazon to proofread this."
1,moby dick,This was the worst book. The discriptions of everything in the book were so extensive that he forgot to tell the story of moby dick.....
2,Not as good as other videos in the series,"I bought this video on sale. I've really enjoyed the Just Planes series so was very excited to receive this video as well. Unfortunately it is not of the same quality as many of the others. It is very difficult or impossible to hear the pilots talking during flight. The walk around was interesting but somewhat brief.With the wide variety of Just Planes videos to choose from, this would not be my first choice of video."
4,Doesn't this remind of something?,"After watching the movie, you can figure out who they were talking about. Fazion Love was Suge Knight, Merlin wasw 2Pac, Rashaan Nall was BIggie, Toni Braxton was Faith and Sharissa was Lil Kim. The only person was missing was Puffy. If you know the story behind them and you have the movie.Aside from that you have a very well done movie that shows how ""fueds"" can get started with simple mistakes. What makes the DVD worth getting is the Merlin Santana tribute. It's about the only one since he was a quick sentence in so called Black Magazines. The DVD is about hte only place where you will hear Merlin's rap skills since he was notable to release any of his four rap albums before his death."
3,Bootleg Tupac movie,"This movie was awful the script was unoriginal they just took Tupacs life mixed it up and added a bit of fiction. Characters like lil kim, Faith, and Suge Knight are in the movie. Toni Braxtons acting was awful! I Only bought it because it was one of Merlin Santana's last roles and yes he can act that's a given, so could the rest of the cast - except for the aforementioned - but the script and the terrible rappers (not the actors voices) ... I guess I'll always have Steve Harvey and the cosby show RIP Merlin. 3 stars for the actors."
4,Unappreciated,"I have to say i had every intention on seeinq this movie, mainly because of Merlin Santana. but after i seen it i loved it!! It's so honest && upfront about all the shady business and i dont think it is appreciated, not to mention the actinq i mean who could have ever seen Faison Love as the villian. Also whether it was intended or not this movie is pretty much a play by play of the Tupac vs. Biggie fued but with a few twists . For instance while it is obvious that faison is suge && toni is faith and so on, i think tupac && biggie are a bit mixed. jaxx was pac because of him qoinq to the west coast nd being play'd by domino breed (also notice how the record label was called the block i wonder if that was like the row or whatever). but the fact that he had a wife and mistress and mayhem made the ""i f**ked yur wife"" sonq lol it mixes thinqs up. all in all i loved it =)"
2,Filmmakers droped the ball in this one.,"Well to start I have to say that I am a devoted Toni Braxton fan. I would not have taken time to see this film if not for her. Nevertheless, I did find the story line old and worn out and the acting in it weak but the music was good it was the redeeming quality of the film. I myself am not a fan for rap music nor am a hater of it. My take on the film is that it was an ok film but nothing really good. Just wish that Toni Braxton had done some of the singing in the film, but she did not. She did not even do any of music for the credits, very disappointing. They, the filmmakers, missed something there to have one of the greatest voices of the time in the film and not have her sing one song. Dumb, very dumb. Even if they had to pay her more it would have been worth it."
4,Great starting model,This is a great tank to start with if you want to build models. Its cheap and simple. Do keep in mind this is a model and you have to put it togeother and paint it your self.
4,Easy build kit!,"Should have known for the inexpensive price that this would be a quick build! Model goes together easily, no suprise for a Tamiya Kit though. They tend to be about the best."
4,Nice Kit,Decently little kit. Bought for my son (8). Fairly easy assembly (for dad). Directions could always be a little clearer. Would buy again/more.
3,WOULD have been nice for my conure...,"I'm upset that the item I received was not the one pictured. I did not receive the 5""x3"" (W x H) Lixit Quick Lock Bird Bath shown. Instead it's a 3""x3"" (W x H) Lixit Quick Lock Crock.Lixit Ferret Quick Lock Crock - 10 ounces - TealHowever, I have a smaller bird that can use it so I'm not bothering to return it.It would have been perfect if I had received the item I intended to get. My green cheeked conure showed interest right away and even tried to bathe in it. It's just too small. So just make sure they send you the right one!"
1,No interest,"Cockatiels are not interested in this one bit. Also, it slopes when attached and very little water can be put inside"
2,You get what you pay for,This is the biggest waste of money. It fits my player funny and once it's in the case I can't do anything with the player! (ie- I can't push the play button access the menu- NOTHING! I even had to take it out of the case to turn it on. The whole point of a case of this kind is so that I DON'T have to constantly take the player out! I could have just stuck with the pouch that Zen provides.Save your money it's not even close to worth it.
1,Not fresh,Crackers were not as fresh as the ones in big bags served at my daughter's school. She didn't like it even though she loves the same crackers served at school.
3,Disappointed in this item!,"I was disappointed in this item because I was comparing them to the Barnum Animal crackers which are very crisp with a very nice flavor! The good thing about these is that they are Dora shaped cookies, and my granddaughters will like that; however, I'd much rather have the Barnum's cookies due to the texture and taste."
3,The MASTER,"Stewart was the master, the first F-1 driver to see and explore the prospects of profits in F-1 racing and also the first to really concern about F-1 security in races. It's a shame this book is so expensive."
4,Cute Hat!!!,"My nephew has a fascination with Bob Marley so I thought this little hat would be a nice gift, he LOOOves it!!!"
3,"nice, not as soft or long as it looks","a tiny bit dissapointed when opened, thought it was one of the really longish beanies in fashion, for my son. tried on just to see, and at least it still as the look of a long(er) beanie on, no just a skull cap, but not at all how long you'd think. not super soft and plush, either. but thick and well made, and I suppose that is very important to not be thin and ready to fall apart!! one's ears keeping warm are key here!!"
1,Why not download for free,"Very interesting article, but a quick Google search will show that this is available for free. That is how I got my PDF."
1,Useless book,All I want to do is learn to speak some Gujarati phrases so that I can talk to my older relatives that don't speak English. Unfortunately this book is completely useless for that. If you want to learn to read and write in Gujarati then buy it but if you are a beginner and want to be able to learn some conversational Gujarati then get another book.
5,Wonderful!!!!,"I received my movie quicker than I expected. It is an all time favorite film of mine and now I have my very own copy, and it is just wonderful. I was so excited I watched it as soon as I got it."
5,The Snake Pit,"Long before Freud was a household name, Litvak's ""Pit"" powerfully addressed the problem of mental illness--and the beneficent effects of the ""talking cure""--in this absorbing, often harrowing drama. De Havilland delivers one of her finest (and decidedly least glamorous) performances as Virginia, a young woman whose irrational antipathy to her loving husband Robert (Mark Stevens) escalates into a disturbing psychotic break. Amid the fine supporting cast of loonies and lock-up staff, British actor Genn's Dr. Kik is an urbane, soothing presence. While Litvak's evocation of the hospital's abject milieu is disturbingly frank, there is light at the bottom of this ""Pit."""
2,"oh melanie, if ashley could see you now!","olivia dehaviland was at the peak of her stardom when she made this overwrought ""serious"" movie. like most ""serious"" movies, time has not been kind. its views of mental illness now seem almost comical, and apart from the well-remembered overhead camera sequence, theres nothing even fun in a lurid tone, save for the bull dyke hospital nurse, and even she is just a shadow compared to movies like ""caged"". im glad this film brought attention to the bad conditons in mental hoispitals, but much like sinclairs novel ""the jungle"", that is more to be respected than admired."
4,Wow! This one really packs a punch!,"Olivia deHavilland shows her acting chops in ""The Snake Pit,"" a harrowing look at mental illness, circa 1948. Believe me, if you have to go insane, just be thankful we're in the New Millennium, and not in post-War America! ""The Snake Pit"" is wonderfully acted by all concerned, but it is deHavilland's showcase, and she does a superb job. In fact, I was quite impressed with her range and dramatic ability...this is no ""Melanie"" from ""Gone With the Wind!"" Alas, ""The Snake Pit"" is extremely dated, but I recommend it for deHavilland's startling performance. Really, it's extremely unusual to see such power in an actress from the ""old"" school of demure acting. Livvy was nominated for a Best Actress Academy Award and certainly deserved to win, in my humble opinion. She's much better in this than in ""The Heiress"" (though I love that film, too, for different reasons). Check this out--you won't be disappointed!"
3,Welcome to hell!,"The Snake Pit starring Olivia de Havilland is a seething and shocking film of its time. de Havilland carries this film from beginning to end, she brings kindness but built-up tension to the film. Her character suffers from mental illness and the title says it all, I wouldn't want to go down in the snake pit either! Creepy but profound film, give it a chance."
4,A review,This movie (I can imagine) was a landmark at the time it was made; an inside glimpse of a mental institution. Olivia de Havilland was on the mark with her portrayal of a young woman fighting to get well.
1,Bootleg,"Yes, another bootleg of the Flamin' Groovies. This band has been ripped off repeatedly by the scumbag record labels. Don't support the bootleggers, support the artists. Buy a copy of ""Groovies Greatest Grooves"" or Norton's ""Slow Death"" instead."
1,Clueless Collection,"This compilation seems to have randomly tossed together 2 CDs worth of material without so much as a hint of their genius. There are exactly two cuts listed here, ""You Tore Me Down"" and the immortal ""Shake Some Action"" that deserve a place on this release. Where are ""Between the Lines"", ""Sometimes"", ""Yes It's True"" and a plethora of other great Groovies grooves? This set is incomprehensible. Get ""Groovies' Greatest Grooves"" and get happy."
3,Item not as pictured!,"The service was great. I received the item quickly. The only thing is that the item is not as pictured. The bed does not have sides. It is just the flat bed. When I wrote they responded quickly, stating that it was Amazon who was showing the wrong picture. I was told that this was the only type they sold, heated and unheated. We wanted the sides because our cat is old and are afraid she might fall off. Read the return policy, they sometimes charge a 15% restocking fee."
3,I don't understand....,"I don't understand the level of conflicting reviews on this product. Some are completely satisfied while some are complaining of it's poor construction. Does the difference lie with the shape of the window sill or what the interior walls are made of? Paint, wallpaper, etc.? Can anyone elaborate?"
2,Save your money and buy the unheated one.,"I had no trouble assembling this perch, and using the velcro to attach it to the windowsill was fine for my lightweight cats. I was looking forward to offering them a heated perch to rest on while they watched birds in winter, since it gets so cold near the windows.Unfortunately the heating element creates a barely noticeable warmth, and it can't be increased. My cats would rather rest in laundry fresh from the dryer. They still enjoy using the perch to look out the window, but I take it down if i think it's too cold out so my older cat won't get chilled."
5,Don't put the legs on backwards...,I have not tried the velcro /glue thing . I used the optional screws...so I cannot testify to problems with that. But...you people who couldn't get the legs securely in the slots and had trouble with way they fit against the wall...you tried to put the legs on backwards. How do I know this? Because I did the same thing at first. Once I realized my error the seat sits very securely on my two inch window sill. And my cats don't care if it's plastic.
2,Almost a good design,The only thing wrong with this product is the velcro is not strong enough to hold the unit on the window sill for more than a day or 2. My cats are the normal 12 to 14 pound variety and they like the padded and heated rest by the window. But I have to figure out a way to beef up the velcro in order to hold on to the sill.
1,UNsafe for cats,"Had to take it down as soon as the cat climbed onto it--he didn't even jump on it, just walked onto it from the sill. As soon as he sat down, I could hear the velcro making that ripping sound--cat wasn't even wiggling around. I'd let the tape ""cure"" for 48 hours and all that. I don't want to put holes in the oak windowframes either (plus, I think I'd have to buy washers so the screws don't rip through the plastic, and would have to install some sort of padding on the legs since they seemed to slip around on the wall too much). Yea, about the legs, they don't really support anything. The cat is a large 15 pound siamese, calm as can be, and I decided to remove him before the shelf fell down with him on it. Upon removing the shelf, the paint came up on the vecro strips (couldn't unhook the velcro from itself). I do not recommend this product."
4,My cats loved it!,"My cats absolutely loved this in the window! Unfortunately we live in apartment with steel framed window covered in paint, so the velcro came right off, and we're not willing to damage the sill to screw it in. Worked well with the velcro until it got too hot and humid! Definitely go for the screws though!"
3,Not a wall shelf!,"I was a little confused reading the reviews, wondering how you could possibly attach a shelf with Velcro, but thought I'd give it a try. All became clear once I received it. It is made to attach to a horizontal window sill surface. Unfortunately, my need is for a wall shelf to help my cats get down from an upper window. Since they will be jumping down onto it, I was really concerned with how strong it would be. I ended up cutting a board the same size as the plastic frame, mounting a couple steel shelf brackets, and only used the foam and cover from the ""Kitty Sill"". It turned out quite nice, although my cats are not as impressed as I'd hoped they would be, and I've only seen it used once. I decided to rate the product three stars - didn't meet my need as received since it is pretty flimsy (even if used on a sill), but the cover and foam are very nice."
1,Window sill perch sucks,"I ordered this perch and it came w/ a leg missing and no heater. After I ordered it I stumbled upon a review saying how they couldn't get the legs to stay in place - so when I received it and I tried to attach the one leg I had, I found that it wouldn't attach properly at all! I sent it back and received a full refund. I am purchasing a second CatNapper kitty hammock instead. I have had one of those for 6 yrs now and my two 12-13 lb cats can both sleep in it and they even fight over it sometimes!!"
1,Velcro wasn't strong enough!!,"I got this product, very skeptical because I have a 15 lb cat, and a smaller 10 lb cat. As I read all the good reviews of other customers saying how it held their 15-20 lb cats , I figured I'd give it a try. My cats loved it for the first 5 or so days, then , just as I thought, it started falling! I do believe however, it MAY have to do with my window sills being so small, even though the product description says it would fit on any sill. I am going to try to use the screws it came with, hopefully my cats will not be too fearful to try to get on it again. (I also bought at the same time a K&H Kitty Sill Deluxe Bloster Cat Bed, hoping 1 would prove me wrong and just hold with the velcro, but about 2 days later, that one as well, on the floor.)"
2,Design flaw?,"This is a nice cat window seat, larger than most, I would've liked keeping it. However, we were unable to place the 2 supports into the slots as required, no matter how we tried. And, even if we would've screwed it into the window sill, it still wouldn't have been supported against the wall. So it was returned.The return and refund of cost & shipping were promptly & satisfactorily processed by a concerned distributor/dealer."
1,very poor quality and defective design,"Very Poor Quality- leg keeps falling off. Amazon was great and sent a new one, same problem. Cheap plastic that breaks when trying to get legs to stay on, legs fall off continually...save your time, exchanges and returns will not solve poor quality in manufacturing and defective design issues... ah, by the way kitten weighs 4.2 lbs so we are not talking about fat cats or excess weight, I cannot imagine a full grown cat on this since a kitten causes leg to fall off constantly! left leg on both units so it is a design issue (leg holes are probably not lined up properly causing right side to lean against wall but not left side and neither side locks into place to begin with)..."
2,JUST FOR HIGH JUMPERS AND YOUNG'NS,"If u worry about your cat hurting a leg or hip or if your kitties are older, do not buy this!!!!! It requires a cat who can really jump. I'd say this is for young cats or kittens and heaven forbid you don't attach it securely and contrary to another review, it is not easy to attach. U also have to think about weight of your cat because jumping requires landing which can pull it loose. My siamese are also ""sprawlers"" and nap stretched out alot. I gave it away because they fell off. I don't understand why people don't watch their cats after a snooze. They don't awake and just go. They get up slowly and streeeeetch and are taken by surprize when that stretch lands them on the floor. If your cat is a lightweight, curls up,and takes time to look around, OK but if they are are fast ... watch it."
4,Should have ordered TWO!!,"I bought this cat ledge for my 13-year-old, fifteen pound tiger cat since he loves lying in open windows, but my new home has narrower sills than where I used to live. My husband attached it to a bedroom window (definitely preferred using the screws to make it more secure) and my cat warily observed it for a day or two. By day three we consistently found him lying on his new perch, and since then he has hardly napped anywhere else! He loves lying in the fresh air and hearing the birds outside. Now I'll have to get a second one so he can have a different view from another room-- give him some variety. Thrilled with this item!"
4,kitty sill review,"My cats love it, they actually have been fighting over it so I may order another. The velcro wasn't sturdy at all but we used the screws that came with the product and its been up since. The fleece like cover comes off for easy washing. The shipping was fast and on time; however, the box wasn't even taped up and was completely opened with everything falling out of it when I found it outside my apt door."
1,Not a good cat sill,I thought I was getting a secure cat window sill. I have marble window sills so I can't nail anything in. I used the velcro but it didn't hold up the brackets are not secure at all I am very unhappy with purchase. The sill actually fell. I will never use it again waste of money.
1,Poor design,"I so wanted this to work, but it is poorly designed and cheaply made. The plastic supports will not stay on no matter what I did."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!,"The concept is great - but it is a crappy product and a waste of money. It is completely unstable and while the stick on velcro is very strong (and it's still on the wall - it won't come off), the dynamics of the sill doesn't make it possible for a cat to lie or even sit down on it. My cats are of medium size and when one of the stepped on it - not jumped - the whole thing came crashing down. When my husband and I tried to secure it on, we failed miserably.If you love your cat, stay away from this one."
4,easy and sturdy,nice product. Easy to assemble and strong Cat loves it. holds a heavy cat with no problem .Great price in comparison with others
1,Not great,The legs do not attach as the instructions state. It was a waste of my money. I would not purchase again
5,great for dogs too!,Bought this for my daughters dogs that love to sit in the window sills. Now they share it and don't push each other out of the window. LOL
3,K&H 3096 Unheated Thermo-Kitty Sill Seat,Cats love the seat. The only problem: Had to modify the braces to fit my window. Braces do not extend out far enough from the wall to accomodate the seat attachment lock.
3,"good book, but missing info from older edition","I bought this book for my personal collection after frequently using an older edition my professor had. Once I got my copy I was rather dissapointed to realize the section on measuring flow and thermistor construction (the section I REALLY wanted the book for) was not included. There was basically a brief statement saying it could be found in the older edition, but was not included in this one. Bummer."
5,"A rare, wonderful little boook","This is a very valuable book about the Concord area of Person Co., NC. The author was a professor of history at the University of NC at Chapel Hill. The book deals with his childhood and youth in the area and relates anecdotes about other families and personages in the era from just after the Civil War. There are several prominent families in the area and he comments on these and their connections.This is about as good a genealogical reference that exists for the area."
4,unique crafts in a quality book,"I am glad I purchased this workbook. However, some of the activities are a bit difficult for my 4 year old to cut out on her own. It has definitely helped to improve her skills in cutting with scissors. She usually needs my help/supervision, but I love giving her a variety of activities to do each day. The pages are thick enough and the illustrations are cute and unique."
5,Children's crafts,This is a great book. It has wonderful ideas and the cutting activities are liked very much by children. i would recommend it highly.
1,The only thing sick is that this DVD was released,"I can't stress enough how dissappointing this DVD is. Clearly the producers weren't able to clear synch and footage rights for most of the bands that feature the subjects of their interviews (which themselves suffer from either boring responses or poor audio). In fact, one of many problems with this DVD is its overall lack of musical content. If you're trying to open up people's eyes to this subculture, you have to start with the MUSIC first. While it was ""great"" hearing people say over and over that The Meteors started it all, if you actually want to see and hear their classic performances or if you're a fan (or even just curious) about the cult of psychobilly, go elsewhere and pick up the ""Blood On The Cats"" and ""Stompin' At The Klub Foot"" DVDs for historic live performances from the UK psychobilly greats."
2,No battery life,"This is a pretty easy camera to use but I would NEVER buy this one again. It eats up battery life like you wouldn't believe. I've had different brands of digital cameras over the years and I've never had to replace batteries so quickly.If I keep the batteries in the camera for even 2 days, I can then use these basically NEW batteries for about 6 or 7 pictures. It's ridiculous!Also difficult to find how to ""delete all"" pics."
2,This is NOT the same as Gamelan Semar Pegulingan...,"This is NOT the same as Gamelan Semar Pegulingan...different material, and if there is any overlap the songs are cut drastically from the LP/CD original. Just so you know!!"
3,not as bad as advertised,if parodys arent your thing then this movie isnt for you. ive seen scary movie 4 and date movie and this movie to me is better than both of those. its not as funny as scary movie 1 or 2 but it passes the time nicely. and who ever said the plot isnt from any sports movie needs to watch more sports movies before they make comments like that. alot of the movie made fun of varsity blues and a hand full of others. worth a rental but probably not worth buying
4,"Funny ""instant replay"" of sporting events.","Pure silliness, and a good way to have a few laughs after a busy day. I liked this film as it was pure satire. It makes fun of many memorable sports lines from over the years. In your face slapstick comedy. I liked the way ""Rocky"" disintegrated in the boxing ring! A great watch when your laugh reserves are running low. Not for kids, as the suggestive content is more suited for adults. If you are looking for a film to critique, look further. If you want a movie to laugh at and not analyze, this one should work fine. Not perfect, but it did make me laugh out loud, and that was the point when I picked out a comedy."
2,Advice! Watch It When You're High On Meds,"Weird thing was, I got two versions of this movie, or at least I think I saw two. The first time I watched this, it cracked me up and I had a great time and loved the movie. Second time, I thought it sucked big time.Only difference was, the first time I watched it, I was loopy on fever medication.So my advice is, watch this when you're loopy on meds and this movie might appear a lot funnier than it really is. This is not a joke as I looked around hours just to find this movie online only to be severely disappointed, thinking I would get a good laugh as the first time I watched it."
2,Comebacks,Remember the short lived sitcom Just The Ten of Us? It stared Heather Langenkamp of Nightmare On Elm Street fame. Well someone must have watched it because its basically the same thing as this film. Hell David Koechner even looks like the dad from the show. I choose this over Witless Protection. I know its like picking between cutting your nuts off with a rusty razor or shooting yourself in the head. I wanted a comedy and the movies were on sale. Not alot of laughs in the movie and its pretty predictable.David Koechner is not ready to lead a film. He can be funny but cannot hold a movie for long.
1,Unbelievably Bad Movie,"In the battle for worst movie ever, The Comebacks has to be one of the favorites. I think there was one funny moment, but like a traumatic car accident, I have blocked out the specifics of this cinematic wreck. Hard to believe that a movie studio would actually pay to have this made and release it in the theaters. Money flushed down the toilet would be a better investment."
1,Worst parody movie ever!,This movie sucks. I do not even consider this movie to be funny. The plot was ridiculously pointless and humorless. There were hardly any sports movie reference. This is just a cheap way of taking in movie. Poor effort on anybody's involvement in making this movie.
3,3 stars is a gift..... a major gift,"The comebacks stars ""David Koechner"", who looks a bit like Randy Quaid. He plays a retired loser coach, who gets a chance to make a ""comeback"" by coaching a college football team.Not too much to say about this one. It's pretty much the same as those ""scary movies"", ""date movie"", ""epic movie"" types. This is a simple minded dumb movie aimed at young teenagers, and it contains alot of sexual jokes. I don't know how this revolution started with the raunchy sex jokes (maybe American pie), but it really isn't funny. At one point the butter fingers quarterback (Matthew Lawrence) is trying to grab a girls breast. When did that become funny? Sure, I would love to squeeze some breast myself, but not for laughter. Other innapriate jokes include the rival team popping out of a giant condom before the game, and 2 female cheerleaders kissing.There are several good cameo's from Dennis Rodman, (WWE DIVA) Stacey Keibler, and Carl Weathers (Apollo Creed)."
5,Lodge Dutch Ovens,These camp ovens are excellent quality and made to last forever. It was well worth the costs of having it posted to Australia. Unfortunately they are not available in Australia but ordering through Amazon was quick and easy and I had no postage or delivery difficulties
5,Awesome Product!,"Got this as a gift for my girlfriend. She absolutely loved it. Very solid, and well built! She used it the day after opening and made an excellent beef vegetable soup. It was superb! Highly recommended."
3,I got a rock,"I've bought a great deal of cast iron cookware from Lodge through Amazon (10 1/2 skillet, 12"" skillet, 3 qt combo cooker, 7 qt dutch oven and more.) This is the first one that showed up with pitting and irregularities inside the cooking surface. Had I been looking at these in the store this one would have been passed over for a better one. This compares poorly to all the others I've bought and hope I don't have any issues with this later on.Now don't get me wrong, I'm a total convert and greatly appreciate cooking in cast iron, been doing it since I was a young lad as that's what was in me mum's kitchen. There was a family battle who got the cookware that my sister won out on and they're now in third generation of service.Cooking with this asap and may consider redoing the seasoning like I had with the 12"" skillet. The irregularities are not so severe to be considered quality issue, just this is my first piece with what I'm observing an impefect patina."
5,Tank Like,"Great Pot. Works great in many different applications. Can use it to cook in the oven, smoker, stove top, fireplace or over open flame.Built to last. I give a light coat of Veg Oil after every use. Do not cover pot while not in use. Keep pot and cover vented. Moisture will stay inside a covered pot and start to rust the metal."
5,Love this dutch oven,"Big enough for just about any job, solid and solidly made. The springy spot on the center of the handle is startlingly awesome, particularly when the thing is loaded down with a cauldron full of stew or roast.I also love the little cones on the underside of the lid. It makes everything self-basting, and also seems to do a good job at preventing me from scalding the hell out of myself every time I pick up the lid. Washing the lid is occasionally a very slight challenge, but since 99% of the time I'm just giving it a quick spray with the sink hose I can't say that should be any deterrent at all.It comes pre-seasoned, but I always run 'em through the oven with a thin coating of some good, ol' bacon grease to seal the deal. I do everything in this bad boy from casseroles, soups, stews, and meats, to slow-cooked breakfast cereals and even popcorn. I still use my crockpot very occasionally, but far more often than not this is my go-to slow cooking tool these days."
5,This Pot Rocks,"It's big, it's heavy and it works beautifully! I use it for soups and stews primarily. It's great for pot roast, chili, jambalaya and all those other things bachelors make to tide them through the week. It's very nicely cast, easy to care for, and to my eye, looks great. For most of what I do, an enameled dutch oven would be expensive and superfluous. Just be sure to wipe it down with a little oil after rinsing.It looks like it'll last forever. I'm willing it to my youngest nephew."
5,"Cast Iron, Wonderful","Love it, Love it, Love it. Buy it!!!!! You will not be sorry. Just follow instructions about never using soap and alwasy greasing before and after use either with oil or grease, and you cannot go wrong. Huge pot, I love to make stews and beans and this pot is perfect, I call it a pot, it is a dutch oven, and it is super!!!! Wish I had know years ago, never need a crock pot when you have one of these."
4,lodge logic 9 qt dutch oven,"i bought to saute on a stove top. i loved the coil handle top, the depth was about right for my needs (higher than an actual saute pan so that ingredients wouldn't spill out, but much lower than a stockpot so than i could maneuver inside without getting burned), but i would have preferred a pan/pot that had a diameter 2 or 3"" greater. lodge logic (nor does anyone else that i could find) doesn't make a fry pan deep enough, and the larger dutch ovens are designed for camp fire use have built-in legs, which wouldn't work on a stove top. i kept it because it was the best compromise i could find."
5,"Great dutch oven, at a great price","It's cast iron, not really much more to say about it than that, except that the preseasoning works very well. And yes, it's very heavy, again, it's cast iron, what do you expect?"
4,Needs to be seansoned,"I was under the impression with this product I could wash it and start cooking. I was wrong. It still needs to be seasoned and started to rust quickly. But, now that it is all set to go, I have had no problems. Works great as with all the Lodge products. I was disappointed how long it took for it to be delivered. I ordered enough to get the free shipping and did not get my order for three weeks."
3,Cast Iron Dutch oven,"heavy, the preseasoned part is a joke, the pan rusted after the first use, just have to continue to season the pot."
1,Very Heavy,"This dutch oven is cast iron and would be very heavy to lift out of the oven were it full of soup, stews, etc. Only order if you are sure you lift it out of the oven. I have returned it. Beware the return policy! They take the payment out of your account in seconds to pay for it....the return of your purchase can, however take 4 WEEKS to appear in your account (minus of course, the shipping costs!)!!"
5,Love it!,"I purchased this as a gift for my boyfriend who loves to cook. He wanted a set of cast iron and this met all of the criteria suggested by his favorite, science-loving celebrity chef. We have made stew and baked beans and chili and we adore it. The bale and the spikes on the inside of the lid are awesome features."
5,Great Deal and Service,"I have 2 Lodge Dutch ovens that I cook in all the time. This was a gift for a friend. The pre-seasoned product is great. It arrived actually in just a couple of days, much quicker than expected. I will probably order more in the future to give as gifts. They are great to make into a gift basket."
5,Perfect size,I have baked bread in this oven in both the gas oven and over charcoals at a fireplace. I think the fireplace bread was nicer but that is my opinion. Nice size.
5,Best pot I have ever owned!,"I love this pot! This was my first cast iron pot and I am really impressed with the quality. It is very heavy and holds heat beautifully. The old-fashioned handle looks great and makes it easy to get out of the oven. I've used it in the oven and on the stove and have had no problems with food sticking. It's easy to clean with just a little soaking. I make sure I dry off all the water and lightly oil it before storing and it's stayed ""as new""."
4,"Great, But Huge & Very Heavy","I love cooking with cast iron and bought this so I could make just about anything in it. I have a hard time washing it because it is VERY heavy. I wish it had larger side handles to make it easier to move. The spiral handle is only useful if using on a fire. I still use this, but I will be ordering the 7 quart soon."
4,"less than my ideal, but best unit available and plenty good enough","I'd prefer a flat, cup shaped lid to faciltate holding a few hot coals when baking outside campfire style and that flat style lid also allows the lid a duel function of griddle/skillet... like on the Bajou brand; But Bajou's construction isn't near as good, its sides are an uneaven inconsistant thickness and the irons surface is rough not smooth like the well made Lodge. I'd prefer the 9 qt Lodge to have a smaller diameter with higher sides. I'd prefer it came as a 10 qt. It's finest attribute is the quality of it's constuction: the iron is even all over and nice and smooth which makes for no stick cast iron seasoning and delicious food. This cooking pot, if cared for, could last a few hundred years and actually get better with time, this is the one I kept. Lodge still does it best."
4,Dutch Oven,Great pot for deep fat frying Lake Erie Perch! Long periods of high heat just kill those aluminum pots but not this one. These cast iron pots can take the heat!!!
3,Not for use w/ charcoal...,"Nothing particularly wrong with this model, just wish it were suitable for putting coals under it and on the lid. It has no space for either, and even turning the lid over doesn't work because for some reason it has spikes...which also makes it a pain to scrub off. The spring handle makes it very difficult to lift off a hot fire/hot coals because you can't use a tool to do it with. Best for use on a camp stove or indoor stove."
2,Brown Iron Desk Clock,The clock itself was o.k. in looks but stopped running after a couple of hours. Batteries were changed and it still did not work again. Contact to vendor was very good. Vendor refunded my money.
3,contemporary disney,"This was an okay book, but not quite what I expected. There are a lot of songs from Hannah Montana and the high school musical series not just the Disney movies we love. If you go for the newer Disney teen stuff, you might like it, but that's not why I ordered it so it wasn't what a wanted."
3,Poor song choices,"Some of the songs really disappointed me. ""Part of Your World,"" for example, is written as simply as the big-note version. And there is a lot of space wasted for Disneyland resort music...and I doubt many people care to play any of that. But there are some nice things too, like music from the Lion King broadway musical. I just wish that ""Contemporary Disney"" didn't mean ""Disneyland resort + stuff from random sequels like 102 Dalmations that no one cares about."""
3,Received different item,The product that I received was not the book that was shown. I received the second addition of the book. I wanted the book shown due to the song selections and it was requested by my daughters voice teacher. We were looking forward to the classic Disney songs. The book I received had a number of High School Musical and Hannah Montana songs. There were some songs that we will enjoy but was disappointed that it was not what we were expecting.
2,A Disappointment,"The idea of this series of little books is great -- small books with patterns for small things. Pop them in your purse, and you can knit in waiting rooms and traffic jams. And of course, being a Vogue book, this one contains accurate, clear instructions with good photographs.But the patterns themselves are a disappointment. A jester's hat, a sort of crusader helmet, a Peruvian cap without the style of a real Peruvian cap -- these are some examples of the extreme. Those that are not extreme are old-fashioned: a long-tailed ski cap, a fisherman's hat so badly designed that even in the (doubtless beutifully knitted) example, the increases and decreases are obtrusive and ugly, a very ordinary watch cap.I'll probably carry this with me in the fall to make watch caps and berets for holiday gifts, but I wouldn't have bought it if I had seen inside it first."
1,It is Not a Brand-New book that it claims. Sold By Amazon.!!!,"I'm so disappointed in Amazon that Claims that This book ""Sociology: The Core"" is New. However, It's Not obviously. The book has Hight-lighted at a Page, which is Green. I've paid for $48.18 for it. And what I've gotten is A Used?? Really??? It should be indicated condition ""like new"", or ""good"" ect. instead of NEW. I got to say:"" Amazon, whoever works there, you should Not treat Customers like this. We know which one is New, and which one is Used. We are not STUPID. -_-"
2,book review,"never read this book so don't read this for an opinion. i dropped the class that this book accompanied, but im guessing it might have been a good book since i know all intro to soci classes at my school use this book"
4,cute collectable,my daughter is a huge elvis fan; so this is fun for her. a nice collectable; realistic and fun. she enjoyed it; the guitar is a nice touch.
1,Waste of money.,I was very disappointed in this publication. I expected some workable plans for a small space (4x8). That is why I chose N scale. Most of the plans are for very unrealistic layouts on much larger tables.
1,terible,Buy these videos and I'm very disappointedDo not buy these videos just throwing your money awayI recommend you ask other musicians to buy the videosListenRead phoneticallyDictionary - View detailed dictionarypreposition0.with0.withal
2,Not like their other works,"I thought this book would be similar to the author's previous colaborations where they wrote about business. BIG MISTAKE. Although the style is similar, the content is very different. This book tells a religious story. Even if this is what you're looking for and are familiar with their previous work you'll find that this text is not as deep or witty as in their business books. The book is also very short without the deeper level analysis that could be found at the end of their other books. I didn't give this 1 star simply because I continue to like the conceptual way in which they try to convery concepts and I'm a sucker for the illustrations of Gombert."
2,"Great idea, but flimsy.","My son got this for his birthday and loved it on first sight. The box said ages five and up, but here on Amazon it says 8+. I agree with Amazon that it is only for much older kids. Neither my husband nor I could get it to wind up and fly very well. The winding mechanism is difficult to use, there was no way my son could do it himself and it often would suddenly unwind and can be QUITE painful on the fingers when that happens. The wings are also extremely flimsy plastic which broke after a few days. While the idea is good and my son still loves to play with it (scotch-taped back together), it never flew nearly as well as advertised. The box did have some nice, educational facts about bats, but overall, it was not as great as we'd expected from a National Geographic toy."
1,Bat,"Broke the first time we wound it, well under the number of times the package said to. Very disappointing!"
5,A much better game than you'd think it is...,"This is a very entertaining racing game. I am not really into dirt-track racing, and have never seen an event live, so I can not say for sure how much it captures its spirit, but it certainly seems to be immersive. I had much more fun playing this game than I had playing Nascar Racing 2003 (although I also like that game).Note however, that this is not an easy game. These sprintcars are extremely twitchy and hard to control. It will take you a little while before you can get around the track in the harderst setting...Hat's off to Ratbag's game. Great job!"
2,Hurry Up and Wait... Ok go!!!,This game would be ok if it didn't take forever to load and did not have so many little bugs in it. Try tuning your car and having it stay that way from one race to the next. Not going happen with this game. Decent idea for a game but..............
1,Silly hatchet job on GW,"Although every facet of his life was described in such as way as to portray him as an ambitious, power-hungry mercenary who married for money, it was still interesting to see what Nat Geo's tack on the subject was until the narrator asserted that GW was, untrue to his reputation for honesty, ""willing to blur ethical lines.""Why? Because GW used disinformation during the war to trick the British!This ""revelation"" was so stupid that I stopped watching it right there. I hope we do not find ourselves fighting for our existence alongside these twerps who will be constantly harping on how ""if we trick the enemy or lie to them maybe we don't deserve to win.""Idiots."
1,A Travisty,"Whomever is guilty of producing this piece of ""insert your own profane explative"" is ignorant of, and oblivious to, history, let alone reality. I teach management and leadership, George Washington was great at both of them, due principally to his outstanding character. To show this travisty to young people (or uneducated people) would be a crime!! If I could give 5 negative stars, I would."
1,Garbage,This is absolute garbage and it makes me sad someone would makeup such lies and distort facts in this manner about one of the greatest Americans that ever lived.
1,liberal spin gone wild..,"this is pure propaganda. as a previous reviewer said, the author has spun the facts to his liking. the cherry tree has been known to be a myth for many years. so what?he wrote the rules for civility. he voluntarily gave up power when they wanted to give him even more. he 'led from the front'.the history channel and natgeo have sold out to liberalism. liberalism is both immoral and uneconomic. liberals hate men like washington, jefferson and madison and will do anything they can to denigrate them.notice how often the narrator says 'the man' instead of 'washington'. this denotes the lack of respect he has for washington.the author is an ugly man and i'm getting real tired of these liberal distortions.thanks to all the fine people that took the time to speak out against this garbage. you guys are patriots. we can only thank our lucky stars we had a founder like george washington."
4,Flames,"I just got this DVD set to honour the memory of my late father, who was a Flames fan since they were in Atlanta. It brought back alot of memories of some of the forgotten games that my father and I watched, especially the game against the Edmonton Oilers."
3,So far we are really excited about this product!,"I am not sure about the longevity of the product but we have used this item 2 times with our portable DVD player and watched a couple movies and WOW!!!!!The sound from the small (6.5"") screen portable without anything is really not that good, but when you attach this tote to it, you sound like you are in a movie theater.Surround sound for sure."
1,Drabble Dribble,"Seven Sisters is pure drivel. Slow, dull, stereotypical, pseudo-intellectual whining. Ms. Drabble shows again that her writing is at best dribble. At least her recent sniveling liberal anti-war rants in the Telegraph had a little more spark. Though, I must remember that I am the one that procured this rot in the first place."
3,Makes the mundane interesting,"There is nothing special about Candida, but Drabble makes her struggle to create a new life after her divorce facinating. Drabble shows that people of any age are continously searching for connection to their environments and their loved ones. The narrative change in the second half of the book does break the spell a bit, but when Candida explains what she was doing it makes sense and the ending is in keeping with the rest of narrative."
3,Just when I finally started enjoying,"this book, out of nowhere comes the storyline change that ruined it for me. Had the story stayed on track I would have enjoyed it far more. 4 stars for the first half of the book, 2 stars for the last half. I have to wonder of Candida's friends thought the same of her as she did of Sally."
1,"Boring, boring and slow","This book is slow, slow and then crawls. If you aren't a middle aged woman, it makes you pity them more than a post-Steinem member of society should ever have to. If you are a middle aged women, and Candida is the type of life you are supposed to enjoy identifying with - well, then, pass the knife now.I suugest that Ms. Drabble study her craft. This is not the work of an accomplished writer - this is the work of a pseudo-intellectual writing for other pseudo-intellectuals. Her use of language and plot - well, let's just say the only comparison she will ever get to Shakespeare is land of birth. She mistakenly believes that stilted, overstudied wordiness is a synonym for absorbing story, and the only emotion she engenders in her reader is ennui and stultified somnolence."
1,SLOW! SLOW! SLOW!!!,"If you want a book that ""flows"" - skip this one! As a product of the fifties - and a voracious reader - I think I can usually find some good in most books. This one lost me about 2/3 of the way through. I could deal with the cast of characters and how the author weaves them together - although not too tightly woven- but the entire plot seemed to fray toward the end. It appeared she was not certain what direction she wanted to take and she took several - leaving the reader dangling in the process! I managed to drag to the end, hoping to find some fantastic conclusion and perhaps surprising finish but it just was not there. I would not recommend this book unless you were totally out of reading material and had no hopes of finding ANYTHING else!"
1,"Awful, just awful","I suppose it would do to contrive allusions to mythology to make my disdain for this novel resonate with the same tone as the novel itself, but instead I will simply urge you to avoid this Drabble. It is dreadful. Dull, obvious, mean, depressing, time-wasting. I abandoned the Red Queen halfway through and felt guilty, so stayed with this one to the end. A sadly wasted afternoon. I am all for writers making an attempt at something different, but this? No. Why would anyone want to listen to the voice of a bitter woman whine to herself? Characters should come out of a novel changed, for good or ill. At the close, Candida still whines, just waits and whines, although at the end she enjoys knitting. Really? When the best thing to happen to a heroine is that she learns to purl on Finnish wool, you know it's a snooze of a book. Skip it."
3,Margaret's Melancoly Musings on Late Middle Age Angst,"Reading the opening sentence of THE SEVEN SISTERS ""I have just got back from my Health Club"", I was immediately drawn into this story. Having just joined a health club myself and being in the same age category as Drabble's protagonist I was intrigued and felt that I could certainly relate to her story and characters. Drabble is undoubtedly a well educated and intelligent author and her insights and observations are well stated. However, this is strictly a book for late middle aged women - and unhappy ones at that! So many of these book written by women about women of a certain age are filled with self absorption, loneliness and melancoly. Lest I sound too critical I did remain interested in this book and I think that I might like to read some of Drabble's earlier works - perhaps they might be a bit more uplifting."
2,Should be more specific.....,"This book is geared more towards the much longer loaf pans and doesn't really include recipes for their shorter loaf pans, which is what I was looking for."
5,dlwilson,I am an electrical contractor and I just used this testor today. It worksgreat. Just follow the instructions. I like the case it comes in and theaccessories.
5,Great piece of equipment,"In my business as a field investigator I needed a case to protect my equipment and this is perfect. Lightweight yet hard sided with many ways to carry - either by shoulder strap, handle or roller. The perferrated foam was perfect for quick set ups of my gear. Highly recommended."
4,Slick,"Excellent case that is part safety and part presentation. The side walls could use more sturdiness, but for a case that makes a statement to clients and also helps to protect your equipment investment, it's great."
1,Lack of information,"No wild magic tables, no XP tables, nothing that I was able to use in a campaign, maybe except for the fact that it was a screen ..."
3,Detective Fingerprint Kit,"The product was bought as a Christmas present for 6 and 9 year old boys. They loved the idea of playing detective but when it came down to actually trying to working with the product they lost interest fast. I ended up spending more time tinkering with it. I knew when I purchased it, I would need to be involved in the process but I guess I expected they would have had a greater attention span when working with the product getting fingerprints and attempting to lift fingerprints. Obviously this was an error in judgement on my part. Don't get me wrong, this really seems to be a great product for older tweens, teens and even adults who want to see if they can master the skill of fingerprinting. I believe that it is an awesome product, I really liked it but my younger boys didn't have the patience or interest after the 1st few minutes."
2,Disappointed,My 11 year old reports that the fingerprint kit only works if fingerprints are on glass and then does not produce a clean print but rather a very blury one. She was disappointed.
2,Misunderstanding Toscanini,"Mr. Horowitz's thesis is that American concert life was governed by profit and not art. That's fine and probably quite accurate. To prove his thesis he completely maligns a great conductor. When he discusses Toscanini, he makes errors of both facts and judgment, which are well-documented with erudition and grace in Harvey Sachs's Reflections on Toscanini. Mr. Sachs's biography of Toscanini is the standard; he knows whereof he speaks.If it weren't for the thesis, I would completely downgrade this book. As it is, the thesis is well-stated."
4,Must see to appreciate a good holiday movie,"The acting of ""Touched by angel"", actor, John Dye and the beautiful Kathy Ireland struggle to bring together a family who is torn apart with discord. Ms. Ireland seems in character with her role as a positively influencing Santa's daughter, while Mary Donnelly the ""bad"" Santa's daughter tries to undermine her efforts."
3,Lovely movie for Christmas evening,"It is not the story of the film that's making it a nice one, but look at its total. And its also not a Oscar winner or any other price for acting or whatever, but just a nice movie to look at on Christmas. No thinking, just watch the movie and have a nive time."
1,compatability,"if it were possible i would not be unfavorably rating this specific product, but would be venting my dissatisfaction with the range of manufacturers who settled on the incompatable formats of dvd-rw and dvd+rw. call me naive, but i imagined that there was only one dvd rw and that plusses or minuses were simply a matter of the graphic designers preference.the idiocy that would give rise to this incompitability in functionality is surprising; to have it hinge on a + or - is baffling. it makes one wonder if it is somehow connected to a gatesian effort to thwart open standards.anyway, i suppose there will always be stupid people making stupid decisions. i'll throw myself in for buying on faith.scott"
1,Worse with every use,"I am so sorry to say that I fell in love with this pan. I am a veteran baker, and have baked in regular bundt pans for decades with xlnt results. Trust that I know my way around a bundt! For some reason this pan worked early on. After that, everything would stick; from simple mini cinnamon bundt cakes to angel food. I always washed it by hand (which took forever after soaking) and there were no scratches. Whether I would grease it or grease & flour it or pam it to death, things would stick to the tiny ridges and the whole cake was impossible to exricate. It was a nightmare & I am extremely patient. I ""stuck"" with it for about 5 years. I am writing now bec I lost it with this last batch that left as much stuck to the pan as out. I didn't even bother cleaning it this time; it's in the trash. So sad too, it is just so adorable. Sorry to say something bad about Nordic Ware."
3,Good Idea but not perfect execution!,"I love this pan, but it never worked perfectly! I tried it twice, both times using Baker's Joy and most seem to pop out OK, but not perfect. There always seem to be something left in the pan. So I researching and reading some of the same comments regarding this pan, where someone wrote about not having their receipt for warranty claim. Well, I looked on my Amazon account for a 4 year-old receipt and sure enough, Amazon still had it on my account. I called Nordiware and they are going to exchange this one for one that has bigger individual mini cakes. We will see how well that works. Overall, I like Nordicware cake pans, but I am not that satisfied with these fancy, very detailed mini cast bundt pans."
4,Works great when . . .,"I find that the Nordic Ware Pro Cast Multi Mini Bundt Pan works great when I grease generously with butter or butteroil. When I use ANY vegetable oil - canola or grapeseed - the cakes stick. And there is an oil build-up in all the little crevices making cleaning a real chore. I find that I have to bake several times greasing with butter/butteroil before I eliminate all the oil residue. I don't use aerosol sprays so I can not attest to how well they do or do not work. I use a Misto Oil Sprayer. (I have 3)I find these same results with other ""non-stick"" pans - muffins, loaf, cake, candy, etc. I believe this difference has to do with saturated fats(butter/butteroil, lard, etc) vs poly/monounsaturated fats (plant-derived oils)."
2,Pain to clean and cake sticks to the pan,"I have been disappointed in this product. I have found that the more sugar that is in the recipe, the more the cake sticks to the pan. The only grease that sometimes works for me is Baker's Joy and believe me I have to use a lot. Clean up is a royal pain. Trying to get the cake out of the crevices, is a challenge."
4,Mini Bundt Pan,"So far I've made two batches of cakes. Still playing around with the correct amount to fill the cells, but so far, I'm pleased. The pan is a little heavy and cumbersome to apply the shortening and flour for effective release, but it's the price you HAVE to pay for getting the lovely little creatures to beautify your dessert table. I like it."
5,Excellent gift for the child nature lover.,My 7 year old grandson loved the stuffed snake. He had been wanting one for a couple years. I was happy to find it. I ordered it just a couple days before Christmas and it arrived on before I needed it. Excellent service.
2,Great Product - Poor Fit,I have a Honda Prelude with a factory spoiler on my trunk. My spoiler is extremely low (only about 4-5 inches above my trunk. No matter how I adjusted this bike rack I was not able to fit it to my vehicle. The bike rack would hit my spoiler every time.The product felt very well made and was very easy to use. It came completely assembled and was really lightweight. This would be a great rack for a standard trunk but if you have a spoiler (any raised spoiler) I doubt this rack would fit over it.
4,once adjusted it was fine,"Originally I did not like this due to the fact I have a rear spoiler on my 2006 Chevy Impala, and felt it would become damaged. It took awhile to properly adjust to clear the spoiler but once done and attached to the car it works very well. This rack could be a problem for cars with spoilers that are high or deep and I know of no way to find out; a call to Coleman did not help since he only told me the rack was advertised as ok to use with spoilers."
2,interesting but nasty,"The premise of this book is interesting to me, being a southerner, and enjoying chick novels. However, the author had to insert graphic sexual intimacies and bad language. Fortunately, you can skip over the bedroom scenes and go on with the story without compromising the gist of the book. However, I won't order further books by this author."
3,eh,compared to seven's travel and lucy ford this sucks. It seems like they are trying to hard and the beats are too loud and the lyrics are not true atmosphere lyrics. i expected a lot more and was very dissapointed. NOt a good one boys.
4,Listen to the pro yo,"Okay, now lets get this started. Se7en's Travels was Atmosphere's worst album. National Disgrace was the only sick song on the whole thing. And everyone saying that Felt 2 is better is hmm well its your opinon. Felt 2 has a more ""fun pop in your iTunes and dance"" feel and this album is a little more thinking man. But, this newest atmosphere album isn't as dark or thoughtfelt as his earlier efforts which every emo kid (including myself) from the suburbs was loving. However, this album still has some sick production from Ant and it even includes lyrics this time around which is a great plus. So quit complaining, its a new Atmosphere album, something we've all been waiting for so play it loud and tell all your underground rap loving homies cause our favorite hip hopper is about to get BIG. Peace I'm out. ""when someone says somethings better it's just their opinon"" - Panic Attack"
3,whateva man,"this cd is a bit disappointing due to the fact that ant needs to stop fu*?in around and go back to his 4 track days like he did on overcast and sad clown bad dub 2. i did not really feel this cd i only gave it 3 stars because slug came out tight as hell. slug needs to get rid of ant he needs dj abilities as his producer. ant has lost his edge, ant needs to find another proffession like working at mcdonalds or producing with somebody mainstream like kanye west. to end this review ant just sucks period slug needs another producer badly."
1,"Cheer Up, Slug","How many albums of whiny songs about girls can a ""rapper"" put out?The beats are not necessarily bad, but only by ""backpacker"" standards. If you listen to genuine hip-hop and not the suburban version of it, you will likely find the production to be sub-par.Slug himself sounds like he doesn't even want to be rapping half the time. I don't know if that's part of his ""I'm a lonely soul"" appeal, but it sure sounds bad. It is clear that this album is meant to appeal to angsty suburban teenagers and no other demographic.I'm not trying to write a nasty review here, and I must say that ""OverCast"" was actually a good Hip-Hop album. But Slug and the whole rhymesayers crew are just killing the idea of underground hip-hop by stripping it of it's hip-hop elements. Hip-Hop is not the type of music where whining and complaining to a psuedo-creative beat works."
2,Not as advertised,I bought this item thinking it was a double cd or and enhanced cd or something like that but it wasn't. I have been trying to find out from Rhymesayers if they ever released an edition that was enhanced or double disk but have not heard from them about this yet. I like the cd but paid for the one advertised here with the bonus material and that is not what I got. I want to get what I [aid for but am not sure how to go about doing so.
4,4 and a half stars! Amazing. Better than Sevens Travels!,"Quick overview...Best overall Atmosphere CD out yet. While I'm damn disappointed that there are only 13 tracks, production comes in full fledged with Slug's never lacking vocals. Atmosphere is the only hip hop anything that gets consistantly better. Slug never has come up short on a song. And Ant's production values come through better than I have ever heard. The best overall Atmosphere albulm yet. CD worth purchase for the last track in itself. Slug needs a damn grammy.I only hope than since this CD is limited to 13 tracks instead of like 21, a new CD will show up by the end of the year.By the way, where the hell was Brother Ali on this CD? He hasn't mad a single bad track."
4,Better Than I Expected,"No Im Not Under 13 But Im Still A Teen That Knows His Music. This is not the best atmosphere album so if you want something you can leave in your cd player and not skip a track, Then Check Out Overcast!, Lucy Ford, or Godlovesugly, Then Check Out This, I Was a little dissapointed that this cd has only 13 tracks but, some of these are really good Exspecialy From Tracks 4-9 And Little Man ISnt Bad Ither But, Yeah I Think Its Better Than Se7ens Travels Because no lame ass skits and just music ANT still has the ability to make awesome beat, and SLUG cAN STILL RIP UP THE MIC, SO GO ATMOSPHERE! KEEP IT UP AND RELEASE SOME NEW STUFF"
3,"SLUG GOES THE SAME, ANT STILL HAVING FUN","I am probably one of the biggest Atmosphere fans, becoming an instant fan after hearing Overcast!, and though by no means have Slug or Ant fallen off, there is a definite more of the same vibe that is beginning to emerge. Its not a bad thing, but its safe to say neither continue to grow, with the exception of Ants almost constant refinement of nuanced beats. Its not that there is a lack of energy or focus, its just more of the same. Present are the gorgeous lines within the typical screaming emphasis on the second part of the rhyme style Slug has used since Sad Clown Dub, but it seems there is less communication in the last two albums, possibly a conscious effort to become more accessible. I was worried with Seven's Travels, but this album confirms it, this is atmosphere, now and forever, which isn't a bad thing."
3,Health O Meter Scale,"The scale is fine. The design is great; numbers are easy to read. However, it does have one weird problem. You have to tap (rather strongly) on the corner of the scale in order for it to work. That is even included in the directions."
2,games is too buggy,"this game, and the original, needed to be tested more before release. there's people everywhere, including me, having fits trying to play this game. there's no support from bioware. all software problems are blamed on the user and the publisher of the game, things are never the software creator's fault. though the game is fun, it crashes so often its fun-factor drops dramatically. patches are nigh non-existent as bioware is too busy creating expansions to de-bug the existing code. ka-ching?if you want to buy a beta-game which may or may not work on your system, this is the game for you."
3,A disappointment in relation to the original,"I found this expansion to be disappointing.I first tried the expansion with the character I finished the original with. I practically sleptwalked through the entire expansion. My paladin, approx lvl 20, and zero trouble going through it.Next, I tried it with a brand new character. First I tried a monk, and it was just too hard. Next, I tried another paladin, and it was still extremely difficult to get through it.So, for someone that was looking to move forward with a character that finished the orignal, I can't imagine this expansion will offer you ANY challenge. I think I finished the expansion in a few days. And if you want to start a new character, be prepared to really work your bottom off.Here's hoping the next expansion is better suited to either roll."
3,A bit anti-climactic,"It's not that there's anything wrong with SoU, it's just that a lot of the fan made content is way better. The module itself is alright, but it's too short, too small in size and scope, and there were a few really non-intuitive puzzles.The tilesets are nice enough too, but I don't see why they didn't include several others for fans to use. An outdoor Arabian city tileset, and a corresponding city in the module would have made SoU a lot better.The Prestige Classes are a mixed bag. Specifically, the Shadowdancer and the Assassin can't do much that a normal rogue can't do.On the positive side, the new Feats and Skills are very cool, and should allow for more unique characters. The new spells are awesome, probably the best addition to the game.SoU isn't all bad, but I still recommend saving your money and downloading the fan made Lone Wolf modules and a few others instead."
3,Falls a bit short,"Overall this is a good game but..lets face it if your a fan of the D&D system it falls short in far too many ways. Lack of attention to detail and lack of variety is the problem here-missing many crucial spells, lack of variety in the tilesets, the player pictures are horridly un-archetypical, cant even put a cloak on your character, bizzare NPC choices. I dont understand why its taking Bioware/Atari so long to really take what they have done with NWN and turbo charge it a bit with more variety and such. Of course I look forward to any new installments they might have but this game leaves me with the feeling that someone who never really loved the original game is in charge of its progress...."
5,Dog Training meets reality,"Vera has written the book that should have been written 30 years ago - except no one really had the information then. While this book describes how everydog's problems can be tackled, it also addresses the issues with owners that keep them from having their dream dog. I have trained my own pet dogs for 20 years, and I both enjoyed and learned from this book.Ms. Reeves keeps the reader entertained while informing him or her. Bravo!"
5,good information!,Reading Vera's book opened my eyes in so many ways regarding dog behavior I have a much better understanding of how dogs think and behave and how Vera thinks!The stories made me laugh mostly but a few were sad...her wit and sense of humor are great. The info about Schutzhund is awesome..it is good for the public to get the real deal about it. One can feel Vera's very huge soft spot for dogs even tho she can come across as darn tough. I loved this book!Kathy Mahoney
5,Great Dog Stories With Insight and Humor,"Barking Up The Right Tree lets us enjoy the keen observations and original solutions of an innovative dog trainer whose heart for dogs permeates every page. The result is an irreverently humorous and sometimes poignant desciption of canine and human behavior.(Judy Karau, Mill Valley, CA)"
5,When Feelings Mean Business,"This book is a straight-shooting, reader-friendly guide to making applicable the new theory of Emotional Intelligence. Dr. Ryback's conversational style quickens our understanding of this new and important theory and makes accessible the steps to take to enhance leadership on or off the job. With special assessment tools and explanations, PUTTING EI TO WORK brings to real life what is necessary to lead in the Global Economy. To be specific, Ryback demonstrates how to bring the brain and the heart work together in a thinking way and proves that successful leaders know how they themselves tick emotionally."
4,Refreshing!,"Dr. Ryback's walk on the beach with Dr. Carl Rogers is perhaps one of the highlights of this book. Their walks end up to be enlightening and refreshing.His conversations with Dr. Rogers about the role of emotions, how relationships evolve, and the depth of ""emotional experience"" have transformed an ordinary banter to a profound exchange of ideas.In general, the book has explained the emotional intelligence concept in a clear and simple style.The book has a specific chapter on the subject of Executive Intelligence and its ten attributes such as nonjudgmental attitude and perceptiveness. Succeeding chapters have focused on some practical strategies in developing the various emotional skills relevant in the workplace and beyond.Dr. Ryback's suggestion that everyone should live an ""emotionally intelligent lifestyle"" shows appreciation of the emotions' role in daily living. Dr. Ryback's book is indeed superb."
4,4 not 5 stars ... song choices,"Id love to give this album...yes I still call them albums...5 stars...but I can't due to some of the song choices...I appreciate the bands effort to put new music out...but a reunion of the original line-up calls for the older stuff...real guitars have wings, cosmic jazz are good songs...but I would have preferred full length versions of blind eye and phoenix...and where was my favorite cover...brother Jack McDuff's vas dis...love the dvd anyway...and the audio disc is good...just not great...Ive enjoyed the various wishbone ash line-ups over the years...but the original is still the best...so are the original songs...this is still much better than most of the @%#$ being put out today...so rock on with the original wishbone ash"
1,Delivered to house in nightmare condition,"Here is how I put it to Amazon Returns, in 200 characters or less: ""Shipping box was dented, ripped, and open at the top. Desk/chair parts inside had scrapes, chips, cracks, and a piece once glued/affixed had fallen apart.""I had been warned from the previous reviews, so it wasn't a shock. I highly recommend you not waste your time buying this product."
1,Feeble Table,"This table is soooo cute....my daughter loves it, I love it. However, after 6-9 months of usage the table started to come apart. the table top comes off the pegs, legs are wobbly, drawer is coming apart, the piece which hold the paper down on the table top was the first thing to come off after 2 wks of usage. You will need to use some sort of wood glue to get everything to stay together and not come apart. Wish I'd put out more money for the more expensive and possible durable table. Alas, this will get the job done with Gorilla Glue's help"
3,OK for a small child.,I bought it for an older child. And he was a little too big for the chair. He's 9 years old. And the paper fell off the roll at least twice during use every time.
1,K. Carter,"Can't find refill paper anywhere--NO WHERE--non-standard size!!!!! Contacted manufacturer and they were not helpful at all. Spent hours looking on-line and in art-supply/office-supply stores--non-standard size!!!! My son loves it, but not without PAPER!"
2,Eh,"While readable, this book is basically a rehashing of the first novel in the Rigante series, only not as well done.This book details the story of Bane, the son of the protagonist from the first novel (Sword in the Storm). Unfortuantly, the book does not really break any new ground and the character reads almost excatly like Conavar from the previous book. The book as a whole does not seem to really add to the overall tale of the series and just kind of lacks a reason for existing.I don't want to be too hard on Gemmell, though. This is still a very readable book and even enjoyable, but mostly as a stand-alone. If you plan on reading the series, you could almost skip this one and not be the worse off for it. If you just need a random book to read, then this one would be fine"
3,Super Reader,"Bane is the illegitimate son of Connavar, Demonblade. His father made a deal with the goddess Morrigu so that he would live.Involved with the gladiator world, the teenaged boy sets out on a quest. He must come to terms with who he is, and with his own people (not to mention relatives), to aid them in their coming fight."
5,Better than the first one.,"If you liked the first one, you will love this one. A must read for everyone."
4,"Gemmell is still amazing, but...","He's my all time favorite author and I loved Sword in the Storm, but...what in the world happened to Connavar? I need more of that story! And although Bane and Banouin's tales are engaging, they lack the riveting quality that Sword in the Storm had for me. How long will I have to wait for the third Rigante book?"
2,notenuffsax,"The SF 121 does what it's supposed to, just not very well. The range is very limitted. The sound quality is acceptable, but there is often significant interference. If you're willing to settle for that, fine, but there seem to be much better products out there."
1,save you money-get the iRock,i recently bought this and it's not very good you can sometimes hear the audio but if you even touch the soundfeeder the radio will go fuzzy
2,fm stereo station,i got this fm transmitter to play with send sound from my computer to my stereo down strirs so it dose what to say ti does
2,what does this do?,I don't understand what this really does? My cassette player doesn't work but my radio does. I really want to play my cds will this work?
1,Go back to the original PF!,"This unit has to read the barcode on the inkcart and most of the time it doesn't work right. I have one of the first Print Factory machines and it works like a charm. The PF2 works until I need to replace the ink. Just had Microboards send me 3 new cart and none of them worked and then overnighted me another 6 and none of will line up either. They changed where the barcode is located and now it won't reconize the cart. Tech has been no help at all! 2,000.00 wasted!"
1,Complete Junk,Stay away from this Printer. They said Oh It is easy to fix the problem and sent me a motor to replace. Yeah Right!! Easy? Not at all. Now the whole machine does not work and I am better off purchasing a new unit. I sure am not going to buy a Microboards Product Again. Tech support was good but cant fiz the problem. Sales Team at this Company has a Attitude. Do not Purchase!!
1,Microboards is Junk,"Never worked like I hoped it would. Microboards requires you to purchase their ink cartidges for an outrageout price ($65 for the three-color cartridge). They can do that because the device scans a barcode on the cartidge each time the printer prints a disc. Unfortunately, when the scan fails, the printer stops working.I rarely made it through 25 discs without it failing a scan of the ink cartridge. In addition, the device frequently jammed discs.The support people I dealt with were friendly, but not very helpful. My DX-1 Machine has no Vista drivers and so it has become a boat anchor.Stay away from this product. It is junk! Stay away from Microboards completely!"
1,Trash,"Purchased this machine for office. In second week after purchase, and only 3rd print job, we were running a stack of CDs when the machine jammed and knocked the calibration off. Our IT guy could not re-adjust the machine and he was also unable to get the company to fix or exchange it. Huge waste of money for us."
3,Middle of the road scale,"I needed a scale that could handle at least 10 lbs of soap and it does, but its no where as good as my smaller, more precise scale so I am only using it for the large weighted buckets of soap."
1,Too Young to Die,"Dead at 15 months. Weighed fewer than 30 recipes. Performance good while it worked. Failed all at once. No response to any button. Fresh battery makes no difference. Escali AC adapter tests OK. The scale was never loaded with a weight anywhere close to its limit; nothing was spilled on it. Disassembly revealed no broken or questionable connections. I didn't test the boards, which probably are where the fault lies.I appreciate an earlier comment that the warranty, while lifetime in title, is prorated by Escali. I conclude that I will not waste time and more $$ on this failure. I think I will not buy Escali products in future."
1,Worst scale ever,I was looking for a more than basic scale for measuring brewing ingredients. I figured with a price tag like this one it should remain accurate and last for years. I was wrong. The entire unit is made of cheap plastic. I used it three times before it no longer turned on. New battery and plug-in adapter did not fix the problem. I'm still waiting to hear from the company regarding the lifetime warranty. I've used cheaper scales that were built much better and lasted years longer than this piece.
2,Worked well for a while but it didn't last long,"Only lasted a few months of everyday use, and now I can't get it to work even with fresh batteries. Also, it took up more space on my counter than a cheaper and smaller model. The backlight and unit conversion features were nice (as was the ability to plug it in with a sold-separately cord), but because of the downsides I wouldn't buy it again."
2,Stainless-Steel Top Scale,Stainless-Steel Top Scale yes the top only the rest is a cheap plastic case scale. I hope it lasts a while I am tired of buying scales for my business. You really need to read over what you are buying on the internet. If I would have seen this item I would have passed on it for a better one. I don't want to bother sending it back to buy another scale site unseen.
4,"""Feels"" cheap, but works well.","This is a very light scale made almost entirely of plastic (the top is stainless-steel.) I was expecting something a little more hefty considering the cost of this item. But to be fair, the scale does seem to be very accurate and works well. Therefore, I am satisfied."
1,poorly constructed and expensive,"I gave this toy to my dog and it was ripped along the seam within 10 minutes. She's not even a strong chewer! The ""moose"" sound is also incredibly annoying. I'd save your money and buy something cheaper."
3,Okay DVD,This would have been better if when on continuous play the music played at the beginning of each episode - the song is very catchy and kids love it!Without the music interrupting the episodes they become a bit boring
3,So-So,"The hair comes off fairly easily, and this brush is heavier than I expected. Good idea of the slide lock design though."
4,pretty decent,"good dvd, i'd buy it again. is it my copy or does neil's guitar cut out right at the beginning of ""stone in love""? a really critical flaw for whoever was doing the sound for such a hot opening for such a kickin song..."
5,a very pleasurable return to decades and memories past !,"If you were or have been a journey fan through the years, you will certainly enjoy this dvd. It is simply a collection a live concert recording and produced videos.Some of the older videos are much over acted and over produced as most everything was in those days but are extremely loveable !.I found alot of material that i had never seen via mtv or other and truely enjoyed it.Although i had always listened to the dual vocals of steve perry and greg rolie on captured, to see them compliment each other on two of the videos was very enriching also.Very highly recommended for the price, what a great time capsule. If you enjoy journey you should like this very much..........."
2,Dissapointing sound,"Yes, I know this is a milestone hits DVD, but I do feel dissapointed with the sound.No DD or DTS, no surround other than what my receiver can fake (Pro Logic)A lot of historical goodies here, but I would much rather go for ""Live in Houston"" - a brilliant concert and excellent sound (DD)."
3,"Great hits, but bad quality","I love Journey and this disc has just about every video, but aside from the DVD cover and the sound quality, the video is horrible! No remastering from the source, just the same old low-res videos from the 80's. Low-res on hi-res systems look almost worse than VHS! It even has all of the bad analog atifacts such as severe color bleeding, grain, dot crawl and that strange texture (from low-res) on many parts.It is only worth a purchase if you have to see all of the videos again. Otherwise, hope that they come out with a DVD quality version. I have, but want better. The 3 stars are for Journey. For quality alone, I give one."
4,great but maybe not the greatest,"I purchased this dvd because I had already bought the escape live in Houston dvd and love it. This set has some great tracks but one thing that stands out that is missing for me anyway is, no concert footage of the frontiers tour. And from my understanding was a very long tour. But to watch as Journey progresses through the years and the different styles was quite a treat. Would definately recommend this set to any Journey fan."
5,Love Steve Perry,"NO ONE CAN REPLACE STEVE PERRY WITH JOURNEY. period. I just walked out of a concert in Nashville, TN. The band took the stage and that idiot that thinks (arnel) he can sing, started to sing something but it wasnt like Steve, so I left."
5,The vioce is alive!!,It is nice to hear great music again. Even my kids love it and want more! Bring out some more.
5,rediscover the Journey,"video collection is a great trip down memory lane. The music and live performances evidence why Journey was one of the great arena bands of the late 70s and 80s. Treat yourself to some great music, live performances, (rather corny) videos, and fun memories. Amazon price is unbeatable."
3,Good to see them again !!!,"Journey was my ultimate favorite group back in the day !!! Saw them quite a few times in Hartford (two of them being in the front row )Great DVD - however I was hoping for more than just ""the videos""I like to see some ""extras"" on DVD releases. Interviews, The Making of....and so on. It also like to see english subtitles with music available as well. This DVD does not include any extras - however the videos and concert footage is absolutely great. Again - it is good to see them again. It brought many many memories of watching MTV wating for a new Journey video back to me like it was yesterday.ONE REQUEST - PLEASE RELEASE FULL CONCERT FOOTAGE OF JOURNEY WITH STEVE PERRY ON DVD. I believe that they taped the Frontiers tour for VHS? - however would love to have that on DVD.Thank you !!"
5,I was hooked!,"DVD Perfect. Beautiful songs from one of the best rock bands of the world.Steve Perry, excellent performance! I felt by the end of the band!"
3,A bit cheesy,I really like Journey so I thought I would purchase this DVD to see one of my favorite bands in action. It turned out to be a bit cheesy though - I guess I asked for it since this was a 80's band. The music is good though so that's why I gave it 3 stars.
2,Journey - barely live,"I own a truck load of Rock DVDs - official releases, the bootlegs, etc....this was not one I would recommend. Overdubbed tracks with cheesy video - it could put one to sleep. Maybe Journey was not that good as a live act - love their CDs but for a DVD no way."
5,Simply the Best,"This DVD is great for me because anything that Journey puts out is fantastic. Anyone who thinks Journey is better now without Steve Perry is deaf. The live tracks of the Houston performances from the Escape tour and the Mountain Aire shows from the Raised on Radio tour are worth the price of the DVD alone. I know the videos were not the best production in the world. But, Journey was and still is about live concert music. The truly are the best band in the world. If you don't have this DVD, get it now, you will be glad you did. You can tell that Steve Perry and John Kalodner put a lot of work in to it."
5,Wonderful video that will get your kids moving!,"We LOVE this video!! The familiar music has been re-arranged to sound even better as all of Barney's friends join him for a special sing-along party. Some cast members from Barney days-gone-by also join them for a reunion. This video has never failed to capture the attention of my two girls, and they sing and dance right along with the cast members and Barney! It's an excellent production, and I enjoy it myself (you should see me dancing around my house when it's on)! I might even suggest it as a great exercise video!! If your little one hasn't discovered Barney yet, they'll be an instant fan after viewing this tape. And if your kids love Barney, this video is a MUST-HAVE!!"
5,Barney is great for my kids!!!,Barney and friends are a wonderful collection of characters that show small children what to do in everyday life. They are great to use when teaching new concepts to children.
3,"A ""Barney's Greatest Hits"" video.","This Barney reunion held my two year old's attention much less than the previous Barney tapes we have purchased. After the opening theme song, my toddler is already leaving the room to play in the sink! He normally brings me the remote and begs to watch ""Ba"" However, this video just doesn't do it for him or me."
5,"If your Child likes Barney, they will like this movie","My son loves this video. It's a collaboration from several episodes. If your child likes Barney, this will be a hit."
5,Your young child will LOVE this,"This DVD is so sweet and cute. it is filled with singing and dancing for your kids to join in on. I really like the innocence of Barney. It is for young kids of course, but really lovely.Voice Lessons To Go for Kids! v.1- Sing Out Proud!"
5,love it,if my toddler loves it I love it and he does! He has learned many of the songs off of this show.
5,Simply the Best,"My son 2 years old(now) has been watching this video for at a least a year and continues to say ""Darney Darney"". We're still working on the ""buh"" sound. This is a great investment."
3,Barney is fine,We bought this for my son but he isn't into Barney turns out. Barney is fine we just haven't watched this much because he has other DVDs that he prefers.
4,Barney is Barney.,My 2 years old loves this video of Barney. Amazon did a great job shipping as usual. I recommend this video for your children.
5,Keeps my 1 year old's attention,This DVD does a good job moving quickly from song to song and it really seems to keep my daughter's attention. It is a little long for her to sit through entirely but she loves Barney and gets excited when the first song comes on. I think it is one of the better Barney videos because I don't have to search for the bonus material and find the songs for her. She can just watch the movie.
3,Flowers in the Night,"The story is about a young woman that feels an outcast to the rest of the world due to a childhood illness that left her partially crippled. This young woman lost her parents when she was only 18. The illness she had as a child took away her ability to have children. Her one desire is to be a mother, but all her attempts at singnle parent adoption fail. Then she meets Nick. He has his neice and nephew to care for, and he is single. Soon sparks fly between them, but because of Emilys wealthy background and Nicks poor one as well as his experience with people leaving his life, he does not feel there is any future for him and Emily, in spite of the growing attraction between them and between Emily and his neice and nephew. As Christmas is coming, both Emily and Nick realize their love for each other is real and strong and lasting. A lovely romance."
4,yeah!,Let me just tell you that Sarah is an incredible person. She goes to my church and has such a heart for God!! This cd doesn't even being to show the beautiful voice that God has given her!!
3,This was a good read .....,"Hero for Hire by Laura KennerHarlequin Intrigue # 405 - February 1997Will is a private detective hired to find out if Sara is true to her fiancee, Raymond. When Sara finds out that she's been tested, she hires Will to test Raymond in return. The woman hired to seduce Raymond turns up dead and Raymond disappears. Will and Sara team together to find out what really happened.a good read"
1,This book is fraught with discrepancies.,"Stay away from this book it is absolutely terrible. The focus is fine but the quality is horrific. For example: Did you know that a Windows NT workstation can function as an replication export server. According to the online tests you get, it can. If you reference the materials in the book, it can't. This is only one example. I spent hours resolving discrapancies in the book. Buy Sybex, use cram, visit Globetrotting.com, but don't buy this ""Exam Cram"", its Exam Cr*p. By the way, my copy only had 295 pages of material plus about 100 pages of questions. Even their math is wrong. Good luck. Let me know if you've had similar problems in other manuals from them."
5,KG lover!,Iloved this dvd! Its a intimate interview with Mr.Garnett himself. Its great footage of him talking about leaving minnesota after playing with them for 10 years and how everyone doubted he'd be able to take the Celtics all the way. Boy were they wrong!! Can you say 2008 NBA champion. 2008 defensive player of the year!Its a must have for any Kevin Garnett fan. It tells a lot about the Big Ticket!
5,Great for very dry skin!,"This stuff is incredible. It is a very thick lotion that's also safe to use on dry spots on your face. I use it regularly on my feet, but my fiance used it once on his hands and it got rid of all the dry crackly spots! I'd recommend it to be used as ""spot treatment"" rather than an overall body lotion, since it is so thick. Great for hands, feet, elbows, and any stubborn dry patches."
3,"Thick, Greasy, Sticky","I totally got this wrong and bought it as a face cream. It's as thick as toothpaste. Even using it for my hands, I can't put it on my palms or everything will be greasy. Just use it on tops, and it's really hard to spread around. But it smells terrific."
4,"Good book, horrible binding","Some of the articles are damn good, but the version of the book i have has a very annoying binding, that if you crease the pages start to fall out. I wish the author would have quality checked the publishers work, but i did learn alot from this book. There are alot of good articles that give you a new insight on life. Its definately worth reading even if you aren't a psych major. (I'm not)"
4,"Great Games, but missing one...","I personally love high scoring shootouts, so I was disappointed that they didn't include the 1986 Leafs/Oilers game in which Toronto won 11-9. The Oilers were a scoring machine that year...Gretzky had 163 assists, let alone 215 points for the year. That's a game I would have loved to have."
5,Brian Colepaugh's review's.,I received the Toronto Maple Leafs dvd through Amazon.com very quickly and was perfectly satisfied with my purchase. I give it a five star rating.
3,Nice but not amazing,"She has a good voice and the music is pop/rock/blues but generally pop, acustic guitarrs and good harmonies. The first single ""Solo tus canciones"" (Only your songs) was n3 at argentina billboard hot 100, there are other famous songs like ten second single ""demasiado"" (too much) and the third ""El cree que soy tonta"" (He thinks that I'm a fool). Nice, a good chace.!"
1,out of date,"This is not really so much a book as a pamphlet--pages held together with staples. At the time it was written, Evola may have been presenting hard-to-come-by facts and opinions. Today, anyone with a passing knowledge of Zen or feudal Japan, or with access to the Internet, will get little to nothing out of it. Those interested in Evola might, though. This pamphlet should really be free on the Internet as a PDF. Oh well."
1,Not worth the money...,"I bought this set primarily for the book light and the head lamp. I have never been able to get the head lamp to work. The book light is flimsy and dim. And the flashlight is somewhat bright, but to turn it on and off you have to unscrew the battery compartment without unscrewing it too far that the batteries fall out. All in all, it's a piece of junk. Don't waste your money."
1,Cisco / Amazon will not support you,I just purchased this industrial AP for testing andrecreating a customer issue in our lab.The device was labelled as BRAND NEW- and sold directlyfrom Amazon.com. (Amazon.com was the reseller of record)Unfortunately - it did not have the latest/supported/correctIOS firmware version pre-loaded when shipped.Cisco refused to provide the firmware updates and good luckfinding where to buy an agreement on Amazon.We are looking at testing/recommending with other enterprise class APs instead.Don't waste your time buying this one!
1,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS,"I got this CD thinking it had the original songs that I heard on the radio stations; however, it's not. Many of the songs are remakes that sound horrible. I have never heard worse versions of I want candy, take my breath away, every rose has its thorn, and stray cat strut. They are horrible. Flashdance (what a feeling) and bang on the drum all day aren't as bad as the others above, but they aren't great either. The other songs were recorded live so they are bearable, but overall I would not pay fifty cents for it.I strongly recomend that you do not get this album!!"
1,Pass This One By,"This book is riddled with inaccuracies. Some of the most glaring have been included below:1. John's mother Julia remarried and she abandoned her son and never saw him again.2. Paul was right-handed except when learning guitar because he was a left-handed guitar player.3. George Harrison soon realized that he had no talent for the guitar...it took him years before he could keep up with Lennon and McCartney who were ""gifted musically.""4. Ringo's first appearance on a Beatles album was on 1966's Revolver. His face was superimposed on that of his predecessor, Pete Best. In late 1965 when Rubber Soul was released, Best asked John Lennon why his [Pete's] nose looked so large.5. George Martin won George Harrison in a poker game because the youngest Beatle played in the Dave Clark 5, another popular British Invasion band.There are more, but you get the general idea. There is no excuse for this kind of thing. Save your money and buy other Beatle biographies instead."
3,cute key chains,"Bought these for my daughter who is a huge Zelda/Mario fan. Hard to find something like this. Wish you could just buy one. They are cute, but the controller looks like an old boombox from the 80s."
2,My Chinchillas won't eat this brand,"I purchased this at either Petco or PetSmart (don't remember). My Chinchillas absolutely would not eat it for some reason. They literally would not eat for days rather than eat this. That is not to say it is bad, it's just that our Chinchillas really, really don't like it.We then purchased Sunscription's Vita Prima Chinchilla Formula which they seem to like. I think we need to go back to the food the breeder sold to us, although the Sunscription seems to agree with them. They sure love playing with their food (they wouldn't even play with Oxbow food) and dumping it over the bottom of the cage below the feeder. :-)"
2,"Way, way outdated","Since Ilive inColorado I thougth it would be fun to take day trips. But this book is way outdated, printed in 2002 as near as I could tell. Several of the things mentioend are no longer there. But it is full of off the wallplaces, IF they are still there."
4,Just So-So,I liked the fact it showed the truth about how it was for the people that made that trip. It was hard to understand what they were saying though.
3,Story of Sacrifice,"Experiences of several immigrant families as they left their home in Europe, traveled down the Rhine River to the port of Rotterdam, and sailed for nine weeks across the Atlantic Ocean to a new land. Based on historical facts, this story follows a Burkholder family from Gerolsheim, Germany, to Lancaster Co., Pa."
4,International variety pack,"I was very satisfeid with the product, however, the expiration date of three months (9/06)is not a sufficient amount of time to use 96 packets of coffee."
5,Not the most complicated - and that's its beauty!,"I use a fancy, multi-function Targus controller in my lectures. My teaching partner is not capable of that complexity, and this presenter is more than adequate and far less confusing for him to use. Want a presenter to simply click your way through a presentation? I can think of no better than this one. Want to be in total control of your mouse within a presentation? Kindly move along; nothing here to see..."
1,This CD is ok.,This Cd is pretty good. I only baught it for the song Your A Ocean. I heard the song on MotoCrossed. I liked it and bought the cd. The only good song on here is Your A Ocean. The rest are really not my kind. I would say if you like rock then you would probaby like this cd. So if you do then get it. If you just want it for the song Your A Ocean then get the single.
3,NOT FOR SUBARUs,"This does NOT fit my 2006 WRX, not even close. Not sure if I was shipped the wrong harness or not, but this is again NOT the correct harness for a 2006 Subaru Impreza."
2,Never Get UNSEASONED!,"never buy an unseasoned castiron pot! what a rusty, sticky, disaster! baking it with oil as direction say did not do anything, and really, it is just a waste of money. you would not eat out of a pot that looks this way!"
4,"Love the Lodge product, but. problems ordering this continue","I have ordered this 10 inch skillet three times, and have been sent the wrong product each time after I returned the item received (I have received three 8 inch skillets). I have emailed Amazon twice about the mixup, and felt safe ordering it the last (third) time since months had passed. But no change had been made. Perhaps the item is listed under the wrong product number?I love the lodge skillets and plan to find a 10 inch skillet somewhere."
3,Ivana Spagna's first English album in many years,"I am a big fan of Ivana Spagna and when this album which was her 1st English album since 1993, was released, I was really excited. My expectations may have been too high and I think I expected an album similar to her late 1980s ones. After her great Italian albums, it proved to be a bit disappointing."
4,"Excellent, but not what I ordered.","The shoes are an exceptional value, a great fit, but not the actual finish that I ordered. I had specificied the duller finish and received the high gloss one. I would have preferred the less glossy finish, but it's not worth the effot to return the shoes."
3,uncomfortable,"Look OK, a bit too shiny.Not as comfortable as my last pair of Unlisted black dress shoes which I've worn for years, and still wear over these unless it's a more formal occasion. Just seem much tighter despite being the same size."
3,It's OK,"These shoes look nice, but I don't think they are going to last a long time. The quality is so so. Prompt delivery"
4,Good shoe,"Really a comfortable shoe. Only two slight complaints. First they are a little more shiny than the picture depicts. Second, they do not breath, so all day wear makes for hot feet."
3,Unlisted Men's Coast to Coast Dress Oxford Shoe,"The shoe's sole is made of really soft and low quality rubber. Walking in it is like walking in sponge. May be it's alright for others, but it isn't for me."
2,Comfortable and great looking but lasted only 2 months,These shoes are comfortable and great looking but mine lasted only 2 months. They seemed perfect for the price but after only 2 months the sole became loose on one and started coming off. I wish that they would have lasted at least a year. They might be fine for those people who don't plan on wearing them everyday.
1,Self descructing shoes!,I have had my pair for about 2 months too. I noticed that the heels were wearing down very quickly but today both shoes seem to be on the verge of self destruction!The leather top seam has split away from the shoe for about 4 inches along the outer side of the left shoe. The shoe is pulling away from the heel on the right shoe.Both heels have completely cracked open running from the bottom of the heel to the top. I will be lucky to make it home from work today the way things are going.Don't buy them. You're better off spending double and getting a pair of shoes to last you five times longer.
1,"Good price, bad shoe","Had this shoe for two months and the sole separated from the shoe. Would have cost more to repair than I bought the shoes for. They were good in a bind, but not worth it in the long run."
1,Review,"This book was a required text book. I read it because it was mandatory, but I found it to be very dry with what seems to be never ending chapters. If you are trying to read a book for just knowledge I do not recommend this book. It was truly a bore."
5,Creative Zen V Leather Case,"I LOVE this case. Keeps Zen clean, protects the screen (case has a clear cover over screen area). Well made and very classy! Much better then neoprene skin."
2,13-Yes And 14-No on this one,"Here's my take on this Cd too,listened to this and here's what i came up with.Similar to volume 1Song's i like:13Billy/Kathy LindenWhite Bucks And Saddle Shoes/Bobby Pedrick Jr.Cry/The Knightsbridge StringsBoogie Bear/Boyd BennettSummer Set/Monty KellyLost Love/H.B.

3,Good,Product seems to be sturdy enough. However i was missing some of the nuts and washers to assemble this product. The box that is came in looked as if it had been tied to a rope and pulled down the road by the Fed Ex driver.
5,excellent choice,I am an elementary school music teacher & I ordered this book for my classroom. When I read through it upon receiving my order I was immediately impressed! The art work is amazing & the story is very child friendly. You will be pleased with this book as a parent or teacher. It is a wonderful resource!
3,I was disappointed.,"I used this book to introduce my elementary school age children to Duke Ellington's music. They did learn some things about jazz and Ellington. Unfortunately, they had difficulty with the book's language. It uses phrases like ""cats,"" and ""Daddy-O."" With some explanation of these phrases, my kids were able to gain useful information from the book. If they had read this book by themselves (I read it aloud to them), they would not have been able to understand much of what it was saying."
2,Ho-hum bios make one-great book run-of-the-mill,"There is a voluminous amount of sources for information on fantasy league baseball available to fans, especially with the advent of the Internet. What used to set Rotisserie League Baseball apart from the rest was the irreverent, witty bios on the players. It was the closest thing to laugh-out-loud literature one could find on the National Pastime.Alas, someone must have approached the authors and told them that the book needed to be more serious in light of previously said sources. The result is a bland concoction of stale statistics and rookie projections. Given the fact that a book needs more time to publish than does a magazine, it is rendered irrelevant.Said to say, I believe I've purchased my last edition of Rotisserie League Baseball."
1,Not worth the trouble,"After using two old Zircon stud sensors for several years I decided to give this one a try because of the AC detection feature. Bad decision on my part. I wrongly assumed that the stud detection feature would be as good as on the older models. Not even close. Brand new out of the packaging, I tried to install a wall cabinet in the garage this morning. Even trying it in both modes (stud scan or deep scan), the thing was just not able to consistly pick up up studs. I even brought it into the house to try on other walls. I'm not sure if the AC feature is having some effect on the stud sensing capability, but I really don't care now. I ended up having to go back to the old fashioned way (hammer tapping, trial nail, and tape measure). I'm really disapointed in this Zircon. Now I'm not sure if I even want to go back and try one of the simple models that I've used before."
2,Slim design; questionable performance and durability.,"I've owned this stud finder for over a year now and use it periodically for various projects. I recall that I bought it for it's small profile and apparent 'pro' qualities. After about a month, all but the two bottom l.e.d. lights stopped working- the 'beep' is the only way for me to know where the stud edge is. As mentioned by others, the a.c. detection is laughable. As for stud detection- yes, it's a dark art even with a finder. I can't say that this unit does better or worse than the many others i've used for this primary purpose."
5,Never use soap when cleaning,"Maybe this was already mention by another reviewer but I didn't see it. NEVER WASH THIS CAST IRON SKILLET WITH SOAP!That's how the seasoned non-stick surface works. Wash with water only. Sounds strange but trust me. Otherwise you will wash off the nonstick surface and have to reseason it every time---and your skillet will rust.If something is stuck to the surface you can shake salt on it and scrub with a paper towel. But for regular cleaning just use water, a soap free scrubber, and a little elbow action. The pan is purified by heat.Cast iron has been around for generations and that's how it works. Lodge cast iron is American made and will last lifetimes.Please click that this review is helpful so that it will move up to help others."
2,Unused yet,I have not used this product yet because could not make the cake as the cake plate I ordered was too small.
3,"Can't seem to keep it ""seasoned""","My MIL washed this in soapy water almost as soon as I got it, and ever since it's been just terrible to clean. I ""re-seasoned"" it and it's sticky, even rusted, and food sticks to it. Don't know if this is the fault of the pan or if I'm to blame, but I had such high hopes and this pan really let me down."
1,This sucked!,"This was cHRISTMAS present from my grandkids to their mommy.My five year old grandson got the door ,opened the box and found it broken! Tears followed,broke my heart! This really sucked,as for pan didn't get to use it!Wish it would of turned out better."
3,Give me good ole stainless steel anyday!,"It is what it is. Nice small size great for 2 eggs which is mainly what I use it for. I really don't like any cooking utensil that says not to use soap to clean it. Sorry, but I like my things sanitary and I do use soap! You have to dry and re-oil it everytime after you use and wash it. For the price, I'm not going to complain but I would never buy another cast iron pan again."
2,Not Pleased (Yet),"I bought this on the strength of the glowing reviews I read here. I grew up with cast iron, which was well-seasoned, probably before I was born. I even inherited one from my dear old grandmother. Still not sure what happened to that one, got away somehow.I followed the included instructions to a T, I decided to use this pan the first time to pan fry 2 veggie burgers, which I'd already partially defrosted in the microwave. I think I did everything correctly but they both stuck on both sides and very badly. I'm not happy with this pan and haven't wanted to reuse it. May try to sell it on eBay."
1,Waste of money,What a waste of money. Very hard to maintain.. we used it for a couple of days.. seen most of the residue in the food which we did not like. If you are a lazy guy like me do not buy it..
1,This is just useless.,Long list:- stuff stick to pan- the handle is to small- handle get to hot to use- too heavy even for big man.
5,Perfect for one!,This little pan is perfect for just one person. Just the right size and pre-seasoned too! Haven't had problems with anything sticking to it so far.
4,I wish this pan didn't have a helper handle,"This pan is large. I won't iterate what others have said about this pan's cooking properties and low cost. This is a great pan and I use it more than a similar All-Clad one that I have.I do wish Lodge sold a pan just like this one but without the helper handle. On my electric stove, the helper handle will bump into many pots or pans on the nearest small burner unless I take precaution to rotate this pan to keep the the helper handle out of the way. This is annoying. I have decent muscular strength and don't fine the weight of this pan to be a significant issue even when full."
2,Stick (no pun intended) with the Original Lodge Pan !!!,"I am a Big Fan of Lodge Logic Cast Iron Pans so I was expecting this one to be just as good as the ""original"". I'm sorry to say that I was wrong. Immediately upon inspecting my brand new pre-seasoned pan, I noticed that flakes of the ""non-stick"" coating had scratched off during transit. I immediately sent it back to Amazon. I know it's supposed to be convenient but if I were you, I would order the ""Lodge Original Finish 12-Inch Cast Iron Skillet"". It's not that hard to season it and it's much, much better than the coating they use on their pre-seasoned pans. Also, a 12-inch is much more useful than the 10.5 inch pan."
3,"Not completely pre-seasoned, could use better instructions ...",The seasoning on our skillet was uneven. I will wait and see if this becomes a problem. The use and care instructions that came with the skillet were incomplete. Check Lodge's website for full instructions.
2,Disappointing,"The dual grips make this a great design for a heavy skillet, but, unlike cast iron skillets of old, this Lodge skillet does not disperse heat evenly. I experimented with scrambled eggs. Despite preheating, only the egg in the center 6-8 inches of my 12-inch skillet cooked. If I could return it, I would."
4,Great Skillet,"This 12 inch skillet is a nice size to cook for a family of four. This is my second Lodge cast iron product. I also bought the 7 quart dutch oven...nice size for a big pot of stew. I rate this item a 4 star because it roughens up my stainless steel cooking utensils. My spatula has rough edges as if I've scraped it across concrete. The same goes for my spoon. It would have been nice to have a smoother cooking surface. I'm just hoping with use it will smooth out. Even with this drawback, I have just ordered the 5 quart dutch oven, and the pre-season combo cooker. I just love that I can heat up the pan as hot as I want without any worries!"
2,product quality suffering,"the first one had severe pits and holes. ordered a second one and not as severe, but still many holes.what is the deal?lodge logic is suppose to have excellent quality. what happened?holes would be really bad in a cast iron pan because of rust issues.i expect more from this brand. I guess the pressure to compete with China is taking it's toll on this company."
5,Best kitchen pan I ever bought!,"At first I wasn't sure about an iron pan since I've always used a nonstick pan. I thought that maybe the food would stick and that it would be hard to get off. I bought it anyway, used it several times to cook eggs, meat, etc. and I haven't had any problems with it! The food cooks evenly and tastes great and cleaning is easy too (just buy a stiff cleaning brush). The only minus is that it's heavy but that's a small price to pay for great cooking!"
5,Excellent tool for a reasonable price,"I've only started cooking with iron again in the last month or so. I have several good nonstick saute pans in stainless and mixed steel/copper, but they just don't hold the same energy that this pan does. When you're searing or sauteing, you need the pan to not cool off dramatically when you're adding food, and the mass of this pan means that the temperature drop is minimized. While you're cooking, it also means that the temperature is more consistent edge to edge. This pan is heavy, but that's what makes it work so well. I made a pan-seared steak this evening, which can be challenging to cook properly, but through consistent heating and predictability, it was easy in this skillet. I'd definitely buy it again."
4,Good cast iron pan,"Have all quality stainless pans with NO non-stick anything because I don't want any chemical coating leaching into the food I cook. This is my first cast iron pan. Takes some getting used to just brushing it out with some warm water for cleaning(NO soap, it ruins the seasoning, takes away the non-stick properties of cast and promotes rust). Used to be a big microwave person until I discovered waterless cookware. And now use the cast iron for searing meats too! Great flavorizer pan! The more it gets used, the better the ""nonstick"" properties become."
4,"Great pan, does the job","Got this as a gift for mom in law, she is a gourmet cook and seems to love it, and I know I like what she makes from it! Good quality, Great price"
5,Lodge Logic 12 inch Pre-Seasoned Skillet,I love this frying pan over all the nonstick frying pans I have had before because I don't have to worry about scratching the surface that has caused problems with my previous frying pans. It cooks great and easy care if you season pan after every use.
5,Wish I knew about cast iron sooner,"I was intimidated at first, but after reading others reviews purchased a 12"" and then went back to purchase a 10"". ""The cast iron skillet cookbook"", by Sharon Kramis is great to go with this pan. (also bought on Amazon for great price) Made a Dutch Baby and incredible porkchops! The meatloaf and roasted pototoes were the best I have ever had! 12"" is a nice size to cook for a family of 4. I bought the 10"" because some of recipes in the cookbook like the warm pear ginger upside down cake (which was great) called for a 10"". Easy to clean too. I bought some inexpensive nylon brushes and clean with hot water and NO SOAP. Then I spray with vegetable oil and wipe some of the excess away with a paper towel. It is so much fun to cook in this pan. I can't believe my mother never had one!"
3,The skillet received is not exactly the same as the one shown on the photo,"Very pleased with delivery, exchange and return for this item. The product is good except it's not exactly the same as shown in the photo. For example, the skillet I received did not have the drain spouts on both sides of the skillet. For this reason, I requested an exchange and received the new skillet very quickly. It turned out the new one is still the same as the first one, so I have to return it. Overall, I like the experience of shopping at Amazon.com because of its excellent customer service."
3,Gave as a Gift,The person I gave this to has an iron deficency. I was told by a doctor that using these skillets helps those who have iron issues. This brand is the best and the value was outstanding.
4,works good for two people,"just got this to supplement my nonstick skillet. Used it so far for bacon, chicken under the broiler and eggs. bacon and eggs cleaned up well, but the chicken got kind of cripsed on, so I had to use a scrub pad, which removed some of the season...be careful! big enough for two people at once, more than that you need the bigger version."
5,Cast Iron Cook,"My daughter asked for a 15"" cast iron skillet for Christmas. Our local stores only had smaller ones in stock and could not get this larger one. Although it is heavy and will be heavier when filled with food, it is just what she wanted."
5,Cast Iron Cooking,These Lodge Logic Cast Iron Skillets are the best way to cook...Can't beat corn bread made in this skillet! Searing and broiling maximizes efforts and insures that your food tastes and looks exactly the way you like it...Highly recommend!!
4,Lodge 10- 1/4 inch skillet,"Nice to have a pan I don't have to be concerned with using high heat as I would with teflon coated pans. Good quality and the pre-seasoned skillet is the only way to go. Only wish the pan handle was a little longer, but since it has grip handle on the opposite side it works well as long as you use pot holders."
5,Great cookware,"I am a senior who grew up with much heavier cast iron. I had to give it up because of its weight. These are still very good cookware but slightly lighter in weight, therefore easier to handle, and the pre-seasoning is super. I am sorry now that I didn't add a cover to my order, thought my Calphalon covers might work, haven't found a good match for this size pan so keep that in mind if you do buy. This will be used as I have traditionally used this size, it will fry, it will make pineapple upside down cake, it will turn out a perfect meatloaf. I am happy to again be using cast iron, the original and best of the ""nonstick"" ware."
4,Versatile Pan,I just got two Lodge pans the 12in and 6in. both are very flexible and I can already see myself using them A LOT. Today I made a egg dish and some bacon on both pans and used them both in the oven. I love moving between the stove top and the oven.Thumbs up so far!
5,WorkHorse,"Pros:Perfect size for stovetop Pork Chops....Lid from my Lodge 5 Qt Dutch Oven fits this 12 inch Skillet.Nicely made AMERICAN product!Already seasoned.Cons:Kinda heavy.Had a deep pit on the inside coooking surface, but expect it will fill in when seasoned more.Cheaper at Wally World and you can pick out the one you want."
4,"I love it! Maintains good even heat. Still trying to ""care for it""","This is my second iron-first from Lodge Logic. This one is much better than my other cheap one (which I tossed). I live in a very humid climate, so I'm always fighting to keep it from rusting. I've used it about 20 times and I'm still oiling it. I don't cook a lot of greasy foods, so that might be why it's taking so long to be seasoned very well...even though it is ""pre-seasoned."" I use a regular scrubber, but need to get a metal one. That might help.I love the size. When it's oiled really good, it's perfect. The heat is maintained very well. It doesn't cool easily. Even cold eggs don't cool it off. Things cook much faster than with my old teflon."
5,Don't let the price fool you!,Don't let the price fool you. Lodge makes extremely high quality cookware. I own this along with one of their grill pans and one of their griddles. I was lusting after Le Creuset skillets and someone at the local kitchen supply chain recommended Lodge instead. I can have great quality cast iron cookware without spending hundreds of dollars. AND they're made in the US. I will have these pans for years to come.
5,Same skillet as the combo pack with glass lid,I called Lodge and verified that the combo package with the glass lid contains L10SK3 skillet. You can find that hereLodge 12 inch Skillet with Glass LidI received mine with no problems related to shipping.
4,A workhorse in kitchen,"This is truly a workhorse in the kitchen. Right out of the box, washed once in warm water, no detergent, no re-seasoning, certainly no sanding, it is then put in commission. It does a much better job in searing beef, pork, chicken than the Teflon-coated skillets. I also use it to pan fry dumplings, pancakes, and found the non-stick character works well. I don't have to worry about damaging the pan when heating it up hot. On the contrary, it doesn't take much to damage the Teflon coating, 500(F) degree, which can hardly sear anything, will do it. Plus, aluminium does not retains heat nearly as well as cast-iron. I only regret that I did not get this one before I bought and damaged a few non-stick skillets."
5,budget friendly,"I love this pan. Using it every day. Please note that it is very heavy. Even though it is pre-seasoned, i would recommend to pre-season it yourself with flax oil before using it."
5,Great Skillet,"I have the 12"" and 15"" skillet and I use them all the time. I haven't touched my non-stick pans in more than a year since I started using these. You do have to clean them properly (I just use a stiff brush) and I like to dry them and wipe the inside down with vegetable oil after I wash them but it really only takes a few extra seconds and insures that they'll keep performing well."
4,Great addition to my kitchen,"This skillet is great for browning meat, making lots of eggs, or any other cooking job where a REALLY big pan is needed. It's also easy to clean. One caution---This skillet is quite heavy and is a little awkward when the pan is hot and you're draining grease or transferring the ingredients to another container. You'll want to store this in the oven or another easy to reach location. You won't want to lift this one out of a stove drawer or the bottom of a cupboard very often."
3,Disappointed,"This is a case of not being WYSIWYG! I have a 12"" cast iron skillet and was looking for one a couple of inches larger. This seemed to be what I wanted, but when it arrived I found it to be a slant-sided skillet with a cooking surface of the same old 12"" I have. The ""Pre-Seasoning"" has been a disappointment also. I've used this skillet many times and have to re-season it after every use, and I followed instructions when it arrived. I have a pre-seasoned biscuit pan that has held its seasoning with no problem, so I'm mostly disappointed in this skillet."
2,"Heats unevenly, sticks badly, poorly made","Maybe mine was just defective, I don't know. But it never did get uniformly hot. The food had to be scraped off (yes, I have other iron utensils, and have no problem with them). And the scraping process was rather difficult because of a good-sized burr in the middle of the pan. Since the coating also got chipped in shipping (poor packing), I ended up returning it."
1,Arrived Damaged,"The skillet arrived broken, with a large piece broken off from the skillet. Unusable. Seems to be a common issue for this product from Amazon. I can't see how it's cheaper for Amazon to not package this item well and then have to pay for so many returns versus just packing it correctly so it does not break. Oh well. Never got to use the skillet, so the rating is based on the shipping and not the skillet. But, you have get the item unbroken in order to use it."
2,Lodge pre-seasoned skillet,"Having read how good these pans are supposed to be, I was very disappointed with the result. The pans are supposedly pre-seasoned, yet on first time use, cooking in vegetable oil, the eggs I fried stuck all over the base of the pan and had to be scraped off. Not what I expected.Lodge Logic L10SK3 12-Inch Pre-Seasoned Skillet"
5,Cast Iron Cooking at its finest,"This product rocks. I could not be more pleased with my purchase. I live in Sunny Southern California, so there are almost seven or eight days that I cannot grill outdoors, and this product makes those days tolerable.Despite my long cultivated outdoor grill mastery, there is nothing like the flavor of a cast iron grilled burger or steak, and this 12"" Lodge Logic Pre-Seasoned Skillet is just the ticket.It heats evenly, and perfectly, allows good beef to retain its savory and rich flavor, and sear perfectly.Come on over for some cowboy burgers and steaks and you'll be an immediate convert.I love this skillet, and plan on adding many more to my collection.On the downside, the handle is a little short, but I see there is a new collection with a more modern ""kitchen-worthy"" style.This product is a great compliment to my Stainless All-Clad cookware, which may be more versatile. Nevertheless, the Lodge cast-iron skillet is a griller's dream."
4,Present for my daughter,"I bought this for my daughter as a Christmas present. I haven't personally used it, but I cook with nothing but cast iron all of the time. This one comes pre-seasoned. She says she loves it and uses it constantly, but that is hearsay. The pan itself it a good size and can accommodate four servings easily."
3,Not as good as an antique Wagner,"This is fine and works well out of the box. I use it frequently. The out-of-box seasoning leaves a lot to be desired, but that is easily fixed with a couple of hours work. I'm on the lookout for a larger Wagner (I only have an 8 inch Wagner skillet, too small for many uses) to replace this with. The older cast iron had smoother cooking surfaces, so it seasoned better and was more non-stick.If you're on the fence, buy this. It is a great introduction to cast iron cooking."
5,Assist handle invaluable~!!,"There is nothing like the quality of Lodge Cast Iron, but it's seriously heavy so the Assist Handle is just perfect~! I love that it's great for the oven or stove top. I'm glad I finally splurged on it~!"
5,Best pan in my collection,"So, this was the first Cast-Iron Pan I bought, It did everything so well from day one, that I had to add the Lid - do not buy this without the lid. Stove top or Oven, this pan outshines them all. Now, I still use by Anodized pans too, but when I work with heavy meats and juices, the cast iron is the beast."
4,Nice large size,"This cast iron skillet was pre-seasoned and made in the USA. It's very large and perfect for the grill. It didn't have a pouring spout, that's why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5."
5,Delicious,This was a great quality cast iron skillet. I use it all the time to cook my meat ;) juicy meat is always too good to not put in your mouth. This skillet was a great size and fits almost all sizes of beef cuts. surprisingly it fit a porterhouse (although it might've not been the biggest one I've seen). Giggidy.
4,too heavy and the non-stick surface doesn't work,very heavy and the non-stick surface doesn't work even though I reseasoned the surface. You need to use a lot of oil for cooking.
5,Season an iron skillet,To season a cast iron skillet or any other cast iron utensil: 1. Wash and dry. 2. Heat pan until very hot and add a teaspoon of cooking oil. 3. Remove pan from heat and sprinkle a generous amount of table or kosher salt and spread around utensil. 4. Wipe out with paper towels. This is the correct method for seasoning and cleaning a cast iron utensil.
2,Too big,Will return it for a smaller one...... Otherwise it is a great product that is made well and seasoned perfectly
2,Pre-seasoning does not reduce sticking,"The pre-seasoning is presumably intended to counter the fact that the inside surface is left unsmoothed, perhaps to reduce production costs. However, on the unsmooth surface, pre-seasoning did not reduce sticking. I finally polished the inner surface with abrasives and now the pan matches traditional expectations for this wonderful class of cookware."
5,Is it okay to be obsessed with my iron skillet?,"This is my very first cast iron anything, and I love it so much. I wasn't raised on cast iron, so I had to do some research to know how to care for the skillet (for the novice like me, can I recommend the book, ""Cast Iron Cooking for Dummies""?). Anyway, I am obsessed with cooking with this, b/c I now know that the more I cook with it, the better it will get. I want to cook/bake everything on it. I even baked some brownies in this thing, and they were delicious! I know that until I get a good seasoning on this, that I shouldn't cook anything acidic, so I was so upset that I couldn't cook a Thai dish on it, b/c the sauce contained tomatoes. My husband told me that I was so pathetic about having to use my stainless steel skillet, that he wanted to cry for me. LOL!"
3,15 Inch Too Much,"This giant piece of iron weighs more than you could imagine...It is worth more in scrap metal than what I paid for it.I shouldn't have bought this giant...I'd have been better served buying one size less. This monster is for restaurants and the military.It does what I want, but, it takes an hour to heat the bastard..Too big for me."
4,"Good small cast iron pan, i f you learn how to cook in and care for cast iron","This was my first cast iron pan purchase. I use it to cook eggs for 1-2 people. I have used the pan a few months now. I have no problems with the eggs sticking if I follow these guidelines (almost like making a frittata):*use plenty of Oil/butter*heat pan 1st, then add oil/butter*Let eggs ""set"", do not try and scramble.*Instead of turning eggs, cook the top by using the broiler in the toaster oven*Lift out finished eggs with a spatulaI have also made a half batch of cornbread in this pan, and it did not stick. I care for the pan according to the manufacturers instructions.Cast iron is still more work for me than regular non-stick cookware, but I no longer have to worry about the non stick coating flaking off."
5,Excellent for stove top and for baking,"Excellent for stove top and for baking. You just need to take care of them as instructed. Size is good becuase it is not too heavy. Because it is a poor conductor, it may waste electricity more than other types of cookware. Will never get non-stick cookware ever again!"
5,Awesome butter pan on the grill,I grill over charcoal several times a week. I use this pan to melt butter that I brush over corn on the cob that I am roasting. The Lodge quality is great and shipping was fast.
3,Lodge 12 inch cast iron Skillet,"The skillet was nice. I re-seasoned it before first use as recommended by several users. It was a little sticky at a few spots when I tried to pan fry fish. I used a plastic brush to clean, and although it took a little effort, the food came out. There are a few tiny dimples on the cooking surface, not sure if this is normal? The only thing that annoying to me was since I cannot use soap to clean, the fishy odor was terrible after cleaning... well... 2 stars off. Does anyone have tips to take care of the odor?"
5,Great quality.,This is my first cast iron skillet so there has been a little bit of a learning curve in the proper way to maintain it.The skillet feels extremely heavy duty. Its very nice quality and gets the job done. I would recommend this to anybody looking for a nice cast iron skillet. I'm looking forward to trying other Lodge Logic products.
5,Fantastic item for years of use,I swear cast iron makes food taste better. My wife claims its her cooking but she made pancakes on this skillet for the first time this morning and it simply was the best pancakes I've had in years. Cast iron takes some extra tender loving care but it was a breeze to clean this morning I just wiped it down with a cloth and its good to go. I love the quality and simplicity of the skillet.
5,Lodge Cast Iron is THE BEST!,I'm very loyal to the Lodge brand of cast iron as I have five pieces of cast iron cookware at home -- all Lodge. These cast iron pans (I also have the griddle and the Dutch oven) are reliable and long-lasting... although they're pretty heavy.
4,"Good, solid pan","This is my first cast iron pan, so it's hard to gauge the competition. I used it for searing and broiling my steak. Heavy, but that's as to be expected. The handle is a little short. Perhaps a custon mitt-cover for BOTH ends would be nice!"
4,heavy!,"This skillet is well made, sturdy and will no doubt last for years and years. It is heavy for me to lift with one hand and it is a bit awkward to lift with 2 because you need mitts. However, it cooks evenly and heats quickly. Cleaning is fairly easy, though you should clean it pretty much immediately and not with soap. DO NOT let it drip dry as you'll end up with rust marks in your sink/on the pan. Dry immediately then rub lightly with oil. Healthier cooking alternative than a teflon pan, but you will get food stuck on it."
5,Lodge Logic,"This is a serious pan for serious cooks. It comes ready to use but you still have some seasoning to do (that just makes it your own). By serious cooks I mean people who have to cook not recreational or weekend cooks. When you have family and children to cook for daily you don't have time or the patience to worry about kitchen equipment. Non-stick pans are so fragile that you have to constantly worry not to scratch the surface, and then after being as careful as possible they still scratch and wear out. You also have to be concerned if any of those chemicals in non-stick pans will leach out into your food (Especially when cooking for children). This is old school non-stick - no worries.I recommend using a good oil spray at the beginning after that it will be 100% non stick on its on."
1,Big disappointment,"As heavy as is pan is the bottom is too thin to evenly spread the heat to the edges unless you own a commercial kitchen stove like wolf or viking, I bought this pan to fry bacon with the pieces of raw bacon would cook in the middle but all the pieces 3 inches from the edge would not even begin to cook forcing me to move the pieces around which is more trouble than it's worth. Something I didn't even think about was where to put the pan when not in use it is so large it took up one fourth of the entire space where I place all of my pots and pans."
3,shipping problems,"i ordered a 8 10 &12 inch pan. the 8& 10 were shipped together and were fine. the 12 inch was shipped seperatly with one piece of paper for packing material. the helper handle was snapped off. returned Item.received 2nd pan wrapped in one piece of bubble wrap, this time the main handle was snapped off.have ordered a third,(mostly out of curiosity).shipping dept needs to be informed that cast iron is brittle. OH by the way,the 8&10 inch pans are great. Would have given five stars if not for shipping problems. 6/14/2008 after mailing the second pan back I did not receive any email confirmation so I called amazon and was told that they will not send a third pan but that they will give me a refund.I wonder how much $ they lose on this item? oh well, I guess I will have to try another site."
2,Too big for stove,"The product is exactly what was ordered and shipping was fast. The only problem I had was that it was way too big for the stove eye. No one's fault at Amazon, but I wish I had measured my old skillets correctly before ordering.Lodge Logic L14SK3 Pre-Seasoned 15 Inch Cast-Iron Skillet"
1,Manufacturer wrecked it for me,"I have posted 2 customer images showing the glue circle that's on the skillet when it arrives. They glue the label onto the inside of the pan and the glue leaves a mark on your brand new pan. Very maddening. I boiled water in it 3 times, wiped fiercely, and rubbed oil on the pan and I can still see the round circle left on my pan from the glue of their stupid label. I ordered cast iron because I feel it is the healthiest way to cook, and so I don't feel anyone who wants to cook on some healthy pans wants it to come with glue stuck on the cooking area.This kind of thing is completely unnecessary and really stupid.Take a look at my customer images showing the round mark!"
1,Received with Crack - Poor Amazon Packing,"The skillet was received in an oversized box with virtually no cushioning material inside. Skillet had a three inch crack from handle to bottom of the pan. Presumably damaged during shipment or, possibly a manufacturing defect. Disappointing. Not usable - returned."
3,heavy and high maintenance,"This pan is so heavy even when empty it made me use it less and less. Trying to clean the thing in an average size sink is a real chore. It is so sensitive to water it will rust in an instant. Personally, I found that with just the standard pre-seasoning, chicken breasts and stuff do stick to it. It has its place for searing, but all of its high maintenance issues made me averse to using it."
1,"Too heavy, poor quality","I adore cast iron, and needed a 12"" skillet, so ordered this pan thinking it would be the best of both worlds. I use several older cast iron pieces, from Griswold, Wagner, and Le Creuset, so I'm used to hefty weights. However, this 12"" Lodge skillet nearly broke my wrist when it was filled with ingredients! Furthermore, I was dissapointed in the pebbly texture, which made it harder to clean than my older, smooth-interior cast iron pots. After trying to use this for about 6 months, I gave it away and bought a 12"" All-Clad skillet instead, although the price was much, much higher. It browns beautifully, heats more evenly and is much easier to clean and handle than this cast-iron behemoth.All-Clad 51125 All Clad Stainless-Steel 12-Inch Fry Pan with Lid"
1,Very Disappointed,"Very Disappointed !!!This Item is really, really bad. Everything I try to cook in it turns black and has a metallic smell and taste.Also my stomach was on fire from eating cocked food."
3,Lodge Logic L10SK3 12-Inch Pre-Seasoned Skillet,"I own my share of cast iron skillets from Lodge and other manufacturers. I got this as an add on to my collection of various sizes, at 12 inches it's the largest skillet i have so far. Overall okay, but the finish inside the skillet I received was the roughest I've ever seen as new. Honestly, I don't know how this left the Lodge factory. The inner bottom of the skillet was as rougher than 80 grit sandpaper. I used it a couple of times before I got tired of the spatula abruptly stopping on more than a few ""speed bumps"", before it forced my hand with some emery cloth and a dremel. Seriously -What's going on with the Quality Control here? I'm amazed this left the factory. I'll keep it, just too much damn trouble to return."
5,Last Pan You'll Ever Need,"Here is the bottom line about this pan, you can beat it up, treat it like the step-child you never wanted and do just about anything with it and it will last you forever as long as you clean it the right way. This is the best pan you'll ever own for the price."
5,Great skillet!,I ordered one as a present for Christmas and decided to order my own. It's pretty much the only pan I use now. Very versatile piece.
5,Love the pan,"I love this, I cook everything with it. I it easy to maintain, cooks great and everything I cook tastes better with it."
3,broken,"It arrived with a huge crack in it. I love the size and shape, but had to send it back due to the crack."
1,Manufacturing Defect,"I have just received this item and unfortunately, it's defective. We have to return it and I have requested for replacement. This is a major disappointment. We were waiting for this for a long time. Also repacking and labeling return material is an added effort slapped on the consumer although it's not the consumer who is at fault."
2,Very rough and porous,I have other cast iron pans and this one is different in that it has a very rough and porous surface. I don't consider it good quality at all. Seems to make quite a difference in how non stick it is. I'm very disappointed.
3,Too heavy,Can't handle with one hand. I tried to use it the first time to make egg. It was way too sticky for the egg and took me quite a while to clean it and re-seasoned it.
1,Save your money,Get a different brand cast iron skillet from BB&B; with a 20% off coupon.I love cast iron cookware and was excited to use my new 12 inch skillet. I literally got one use out of this skillet. I followed the instructions very carefully. My dish stuck to the skillet so badly I had to toss the skillet.I'm extremely dissapointed in the quality of this item. I have since brought a better one for less at bed bath & beyond.
1,Chalk another one up for DOA,"Like most of the other 1-stars here, this review is for Amazon's terrible packing and the apparent flimsiness of the product. Unfortunately, I never received an unbroken skillet. On the bright side, 5 stars for Amazon's excellent handling of returns.I ordered the skillet and received it via 2nd day UPS with a 2-inch crack down the side. I returned it and received its replacement via next-day FedEx with the handle broken clean off. Aren't these things supposed to last decades? At this point, Amazon seems to want to cut its losses and refund my purchase price.ATTN: Amazon-- Maybe it's cheaper to spring for better packing materials than having to pay for return shipping and trashing tons of these skillets?Based on this product's noted propensity to break either during shipping or during use-- and in light of its notably skinny handle-- you may want to spring for thicker, slightly more expensive cast-iron cookware."
5,Best Skillet ever,"I purchased this skillet after I recieved the 15inch Lodge Skillet and was shocked by the size. This one is perfect! Not too big, not too small, absolutely PERFECT!"
1,Cast iron skillet cracks,"We're very disappointed in this product. The first time we used the skillet it cracked from the center of the skillet up the side. We returned it to Amazon and received a replacement, only to have the second one crack just like the first."
1,preseasoned is PLASTIC!,Please tell me the point of putting plastic on something as wonderful as cast iron.
1,unhappy purchase,I would have returned this item but the weight of an iron skillet would not have been worth it. It is only worth the lesson learned not to buy another. I buy all kinds of things and have never been so unsatisified. They don't make iron skillet's like they did when my mother was a kid.
2,Wish I'd known...,"That it would take a month and a half for this thing to arrive. I haven't used it yet, but it looks like it's in good condition. Just incredibly slow to arrive."
1,Got rust on it after one use,"Very disappointed. Used once, ready to throw it out. Hard to clean. Food Sticked to it. Got rust on it all over. You can also buy it in Wal-Mart if you don't like it, you can easily take it back."
1,Wrong merchandise,"I received an Un-Seasoned 10"" pan instead of a Pre-Seasoned 12"" pan. It is too heavy to mail back and I now have a very nice Pre-Seasoned Cover with no pan!"
4,A better size for fish,"Lodge Logic 12-Inch Pre-Seasoned SkilletThe 12 inch skillet allows for cooking trout (and other fish) easier and usually without cutting them up too bad. It fits the burner fine and better than a 15 inch does. Like the 10-1/4 inch, it isn't as smooth as my old 50 year old one is though, and the 50 year old one was second hand when I got it. I would guess that this one will be just as good and smooth in say--50 years or so."
5,Great pan!,"This pan is the perfect size for my household. The small handle opposite the main handle makes it much easier to pick up, because, like all cast iron pans, it is heavy. I love that it is pre-seasoned. Care for it as recommended, and it will truly last a lifetime."
4,Great for the money.,"Better than expected. Great size. Great price. Pre-seasoned, though we've seasoned it ourselves. It's not the easiest to clean, since you can't just throw it in the dish washer, but that's with any cast iron skillet."
4,Great for the morning cook.,"I only give this 4 stars because I feel I am not exactly qualified to give out higher. For me, though, this has been a fantastic purchase. I can literally fix all of breakfast on a single pan now. I have not ventured too far into the land cast iron cooking, yet, but I know the basics are incredibly easy to do and are greatly appreciated by all of my friends/family."
5,Lodge 15 1/4 inch Iron Skillet,Everything you would expect from Lodge. I use this size on the outside gas stove for frying. I store it in the oven. Get the seasoned version.
5,No better cookware on the planet,"I received this item a few days ago. Since then I have cooked bacon, eggs, potatos, fish, and a rice dish. Nothing cooks like it. Nothing tastes like it.Good-bye crappy non-stick cookware."
5,Perfect size,"Exactly as advertised. Arrived early, and packaged well. I needed a new skillet, and this is the perfect size, and came pre-seasoned."
4,great but heavy,This a good skillet but be careful it takes 2 hands to handle a whooper. It was seasoned up nice so no complaints except the weight. My fault not theirs.
4,Great cast iron pan,"This is a great pre-seasoned cast iron pan. It is a little larger than I had invisioned and it is super heavy. I have had no problems with cleaning or caring for the pan itself. Amazon by the way had the best price, even better than the lodge website. If you are looking for a larger cast iron pan than this is the one you should get."
4,Cast iron pan,My wife loves this pan. It's a plus that this pan already comes pre-seasoned. It's a bit heavy but hey it's cast iron. This is a good value as these last forever with proper care not like the teflon coated pans which are dangerous to use when the coating eventually starts peeling (poison).Her only recommendation is to clean and dry it as soon as it cools.It becomes harder to clean if you let pan greases sit in it over night.If you lose the shine on this just coat it with a little vegetable oil and leave it in the oven with the pilot light on for a couple of days and it will be good as new.
4,"I love it, but...","I love the skillet, but it doesn't have the pour spout on the side like the picture implies. It makes it a bit messy when pouring out liquids."
5,excellent skillet,This a nice cast iron skillet. It's a really good size. Perfect for making corn bread.Can't beat the price.
5,Good size pan for everyday meals,"I had a larger skillet - 14 in, I believe - and it's great, but it's SO heavy I can't maneuver it with one hand. So I bought this one, and it's perfect. My pan of choice for all my cooking."
1,skillet full of tiny holes,"I just received a 12"" skillet and a 7-quart Dutch oven. The cooking surfaces were full of tiny 1-1.5mm holes, up to 2mm deep.I'm contemplating whether I should try buying them in a brick-and-mortar store instead, to visually inspect them prior to purchase.How did Lodge permit these to ever leave the factory? Very disappointed."
5,Great price for a great skillet!,I picked this skillet up as a gift for my fiance and we both just love it! The weekend I gave it to him we were off camping and took it with us... we cooked everything that weekend in it. We use this skillet now more than any other pan in the house.We both love this cast iron skillet.
4,Still learning to cook.,"This is a large pan. You can brown and cook several small steaks or chops at once. My steak was very good! I was always reluctant about cast iron because of how to take care of it. Clean up was pretty easy. I bought a stiff brush as the pan instructions for cast iron suggested that came in the pan. I added about an 1"" of hot water in the pan after I finished cooking and let soak until I was ready to wash it out. The brush worked great, but I did add a drop of dawn with running hot tap water. Dried it and added about a tablespoon of vegetable oil and spread it all around the inside of the pan with a papertowel and kept wiping it until it was a shiny coating. I'm very satisfied."
5,should have bought this long time ago,"The great things about this iron cast skillet are: (i) It can keep the heat, so it does not cool right after you lower the heat to avoid burning. So you get to cook the food through efficiently, while not burning it or under-cooking it. (ii) And the more you use it, the more it becomes non-stick the natural way. You don't need to worry about swallowing the chemicals that gradually fall off a non-stick pan. (iii) You can make the stir fries, or scrambled eggs, or pan roasted burgers so tender, juicy, crispy, and tasty all at the same time that they remind you of the dishes your mom or grandma made when you were little. Didn't know I could cook until I bought this iron cast skillet. As a result, I also bought an iron cast Dutch oven for stews, as it is bigger and can hold more than the iron cast skillet."
3,Pictures are deceiving,"There is a picture of a lid included with this pan. However, there is no lid included. Would have been nice to know before I ordered it!"
2,the cooking surface is not good,"I liked everything about the pan except the cooking surface. It's bumpy. Even when I season it, the spatula can't evenly get under what I'm cooking and food falls apart. I'm disappointed because I thought this would be better quality than this..."
2,Not sure why this got 5-star reviews,"First, all eggs stick to the pan and even tortillas. And by stick I mean you'll be scrapping the pan for 5 minutes and it still won't be clean.Second, the 12-inch is too large for regular stoves. There'll be a hot spot in the middle and the edges will be at a lower temperature. Haven't had this problem with regular frying pans. Maybe this frying pan is for those who are experts in cooking with cast-iron skillets. I don't know. I'm surprised it got such high reviews.On a positive side this pan should be good for cooking burgers, steaks, and chicken breast. But for everyday use it's not the right pan."
4,american pride,this pan is made with pride. great craftsmanship and is very durable. easy to clean and handle doesnt get to warm
1,depressing,"Complete junk, quite worthless. Ceramic is stronger than the ""cast iron"" used in this fry pan. It arrived broken, the handle attached to a broken chunk of fry pan. I looked and looked for months and thought this was the best fry pan out there and this fry pan arrived. I feel like such a fool. The break shows a metal that looks very thin and flaky. Don't waste your time and money on this ""cast iron"" fry pan. A solid value of a remarkably cheap fry pan for a remarkably cheap price. I couldn't rate it zero stars or I would've. Patrick Thompson"
3,Not your grandmother's pan,"I've had great luck with a lodge dutch over and stove top grill/griddle. In a recent move I somehow managed to misplace my grandmothers old cast iron pan. I was a bit sad about not have that pan anymore but didn't think of it as anything more than a lost memory.How wrong I was. By comparison this thing is junk. It is significantly thinner and has a very short handle. This is not to say it's a bad pan - it's just not up to the old stuff. I'm not going to return it, in fact I'll use it without complaint. I am, however, going to keep my eye open for something more substantial.In retrospect I should have ordered a 12"" pan. I'm not sure why but 10"" of cast iron just looks small."
2,Small!,"This is a smaller than expected pan. I think it may be a bit smaller than 9 inches. Other than that, it is a nice pan."
3,just not for smooth top stove,"I have wanted a cast iron skillet for years, so i decided to get this one depending on the high reviews it got online and that it that it was made in USA which is outstanding in workmanship & quality. However, I found out cast iron & a smooth top stove are not a good combination, and it was a bit heavy for my weak arms, but it does the cooking pretty well."
3,Great Product,"I love my Lodge cast iron skillets. This is the perfect size for two fried eggs or a nice fluffy omelett that is thick enough to hold sautéd veggies. I like to make an omelett in the oven with it. Great size for making small pies and so on. My particular skillet had chipping on the inside towards the top and scraped paint on the rim of the other side. Because of this, I will never buy cast iron online again. I would rather be able to inspect it for signs of potential rusting and so on."
4,"Great skillet, needs a lid.","This skillet is great. The size is perfect for eggs or a sandwich. My one gripe, and the reason I give it 4 stars, is that Lodge doesn't offer a lid for this size skillet like they do with the rest of their line."
4,Useful kitchen tool,"Sometimes, only a cast iron skillet will do. This is a good one and comes at a nice price. At twelve inches, it's quite large and pretty heavy, so be warned that chefs of slighter stature may want to try a smaller 10"" model to start."
5,great pan! great price!,"I was a little worried at first about it sticking but as long as you use oil and make sure to oil it regularly, it doesn't stick. We use coconut oil in it and I find it really makes it non-stick!"
4,A little heavy,"I love this pan! It came pre-seasoned, which was a huge time saver. My Gram has one of those blue diamond frying pans, and this is even more stick-proof! The only thing I don't LOVE about this pan is the weight. I think the website says it is 5 lbs., now way- more like 10!....maybe I'm just a wuss?"
5,Nice size,"As I'm getting older, I needed a pan a little smaller, but large enough to cook 4 hamburgers at a time. This does the job without the heavy weight of a bigger skillet."
5,for camping,"Since the pre-seasoned skillet was a Christmas present for 1 of our sons....plus it's not camping weather for him & his family, I'm in no position to rate this item. However, it was delivered quickly, arrived in good condition & looks to be exactly as it was described."
2,Not like the old Castiron,"This is a big heavy skillet. Great size.I seasoned this Castiron skillet 4 times, at 400 degrees,for a hour each time.I still was not happy with it.Two times with bacon grease. Two times with organic Coconut oil.I guess I was expecting it to be like my old Griswold castiron.To me, it will never be like the old skillets.I sautéed/fried sliced potatoes with coconut oil, and they stucked. I tried a egg, which wasa big mistake also.I find this pan very heavy compared to my old Castiron pans. Although with thehelper handle it did help. It is also a thicker castiron then the old skillets,which are not as heavy.Maybe I did something wrong, but the pan said it was pre-seasoned, and I seasoned it.The in side is very lumpy, and I could not get it smooth.. I did NOT wash it with soap.I really did not like this pan, and sent it back."
2,Ok.... but..,"Lodge makes some of the best cast iron in the world... unfortunatly their preseasoning is some of the worst! The lodge logic line is made ofmuch rougher material and inhibits the slick patina from forming... The pan still works great, but if you want to creat a family heirloom break down and buy the unseasoned pan and an orbital sander..."
1,What can you cook in this?,"Too small for cooking anything at all. The sides are only about 1.5"" tall, so any splatters of grease go everywhere. It is about the correct size for cooking one egg, but that sticks like glue! Do not buy this skillet. Choose something larger if you intend to use it for anything except an ash tray."
2,need a little more curing,"The skillet is ok,but during the curing process too much of the oil was stripped away. There is a problem with sticking."
4,15 inch cast iron skillet,"We really like cast iron and only buy the ones made in america. This is a great skillet, however, it's so big that the flame on our gas stove does not cover enough of the bottom of the skillet. I tried to place the skillet on 2 burners, but that didn't exactly work either. I have only used it once, so far, smothering okra for gumbo. The skillet may work better for dishes that have more liquid and simmer.I liked being able to cook down so much okra at once."
4,Good Skillet,"I'm happy with my skillet. Things haven't been sticking much and it's all metal, so I can make Dutch Babies in the oven."
5,Great alternative for nonstick pans,"I love using this skillet and its so roomy and heavy enough that it's fixed on top of the gas range. It also has great even distribution of the heat. But I was a little dismayed on how the package arrived, it was only secured by a crumpled brown heavy paper. My skillet's arrived without damage but it would've been nice to see that the box was somewhat filled with packing peanuts or some bubble wrap. I know the product is heavy but it shouldn't affect a good quality packaging."
3,Pros and Cons,"Large pan (bigger than I expected, and way heavier too!). The handle seems a little short for the weight of the thing, and there is no 'pouring divet' along the rim as advertised in the picture. Seems very sturdy but it arrived with a 1-inch long chip along the rim near the handle. I am going to get a replacement."
5,Good and durable.,"I ordered it in 2007. It is 2013 now, we still use it very often. Not only good at home, also good for ourdoors cooking. We own several different sizes of Lodge Logic pans. The 12-Inch one is our favorite cast iron pan."
4,Quality skillet,"This skillet is well made with a fine finish. There are no rough surfaces on this skillet. I purchased it as a Christmas gift for my son, but I was very impressed at it's quality and workmanship. My son is looking forward to his first large cornbread in this pan."
1,"QUALITY CONTROL ALERT: MAJOR FLAW, WATCH OUT","I wanted a cast iron skillet this size because I have a larger one and a smaller one. Checking my local kitchen stores, I found none this particular size so I ordered from Amazon. What arrived was a skillet with a surface flaw at least 1"" in length at the top of the skillet rim. The flaw is due to the lack of coating which was applied in this area. It was so obvious that I couldn't believe the vendor would allow it out the door. I was dumb founded. Is this a second in disguise? Are us customers supposed to be so duh that we don't even see these things???? P-l-e-a-s-e. An ebay seller who sold an item in this ""new"" condition would be down rated big time. I will return the item for a refund, but, as the Amazon site says, ""there is no replacement policy for this item at this time."" So, apparently, its MY inconvenience. Do you want it to be yours?"
5,Cynthia's best chicken and fish fryer ever!!!,This was a awesome purchase. I do wish I had this years ago. I bought several CHEAP unseasoned skillets and they did not rate anywhere near this skillet.
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PAN! OURS BLEW UP. :(,"As is true of several other reviewers, my husband and I are fans of Lodge products, and we owned several before buying this skillet. Tonight, maybe the sixth time we have cooked with this pan, my husband was using it to sear vegetables when we heard this loud BANG! like a gunshot--and the pan cracked down the middle nearly from edge to edge. The pan was at room temperature and placed on a cold burner before being heated. Nothing about the conditions of its use should have caused this to happen.Thankfully, there was not enough oil in the pan to cause a grease fire when it ran through onto the burner. However, I will not be buying any more Lodge products and we will be wary of using the ones we have already purchased."
5,Lodge 12-Inch Pre-Seasoned Skillet,"As you would expect, this skillet is heavy. However, the extra handle helps a great deal.I use it whenever I need a skillet this large. I also have smaller Lodge skillets as well as a round grill pan, the professional grill and other miss. pieces. I find that I use my cast iron almost exclusively, because the results are always so good and clean up is very easy."
2,Small handle,"The skillet arrived in sub-par condition, but more than that the handle was so small it made it very difficult to position. It will be going to goodwill soon."
2,Too heavy,This pan is unnecessarily heavy and the handle is too small to comfortably hold. This pan is unnecessarily heavy and the handle is too small to comfortably hold.
1,A Big Disappointment,"I bought this because I own and enjoy several Lodge Items. Unfortunately, while heating this one up over a gas burner, I heard a loud pop and was horrified to see it had cracked in half. An email to customer service at Lodge resulted in zero response. Unimpressed with this pan as well as Lodge's lack of response."
3,good for cast iron,"This is the first cast iron pan I have purchased. I bought it to replace one of my non-stick pans when it started peeling it's non-stick coating, but I'm finding that this pan mostly sits in my cabinet because I don't feel like hefting it out or cleaning it properly. I think it's good for a cast iron pan, but if I had it to do over again I would buy another non-stick of some kind instead. I have used it a few times...I like being able to put it straight into the oven from the stove top, and it cleans pretty well but certainly not as well as a non-stick pan."
5,Great!,We are eggs and bacon people in the morning! This has worked out great for us. The teflon pans just didn't last long and my husband would scratch them up. This is heavy duty.
5,"Love, love, love!","I use this skillet way more than anything else in my well-supplied kitchen arsenal. It's extremely versatile and cooks very nicely and evenly. For me, the benefit of cast iron is that it holds and distributed heat evenly. People have different approaches to cleaning cast iron - I personally use a brush and soap and water and just re-season the pan every so often. I personally put my pan back on the burner to dry it after washing to avoid rust. The price of Lodge cast iron can't be beat, but the low price doesn't mean compromised quality. I personally find the 12 inch size to be perfect for regular use as well, although I wouldn't mind a few in other sizes as well."
4,What a cast iron pan should be.,"The only reason I didn't give this thing 5 stars is because 1) it doesn't come with the lid and 2) I noticed that it doesn't tend to diffuse heat very well. Obviously, it's not an all clad copper core pan, but I would have expected pancakes to at least cook up more evenly than they did. Eggs are great in it. Couldn't wait to make chicken pot pie in it. All in all, I'm extremely happy with it. It's solid, well made and it does perform well."
4,Made in the USA,Very nice and the best part is this is made in the USA. It is a very heavy pan so if you are older it may not be a good choice unless you have help in the kitchen.
3,Can i be happy and sad at the same time?,"Pro: Product quality is exceptional!! We finally purchased our first pan! Con: It's wayyyy tooo big. I need to hold it with two hands and that's w/o food in it. I would only recommend this to families that have more than 5 mouths to feed. B/c the pan is so large, the heat distribution doesn't work well on a normal stove, so it gets really hot in the center but not enough heat on the side. It probably would much better on a bbq or outdoor grill. I can't wait to purchase the more ""feed couple only"" 10"" one!"
5,Your Lodge Will Outlive You!,"I'm still using the Lodge Cast Iron Skillet that my mother got for a wedding present in 1954! I give this pre-seasoned version as wedding gifts, housewarming gifts, and to those kids stepping out into their own apartments. Cast Iron is ALWAYS a superior value for the money, and this pre-seasoned version takes the hassle out of ""getting it ready to use."" Forget expensive wedding registries - buy the bride a Lodge Cast Iron Skillet and Dutch Oven! She'll hand it down to the next generation. A must have for EVERY kitchen"
5,12 inch cast iron skillet,"Every body knows that a good cast iron skillet is an essential tool for frying chicken. I purchased this, at a really great price, from the Amazon warehouse deals. Could detect no signs of any usage. It worked beautifully on the induction burner. Now my friends want me to get them one 'just like this'. All I need is for someone to return another one in the pristine shape of mine. I do need a lid though. No 12 inch lid available that I can find."
4,Great but not Non-Stick!,"A great pan if you grease it up real well each time you use it. We use it for scrambled eggs and it is a real job getting it clean every time, but that is the price you pay to stay safe from ""questionable"" teflon!"
4,Good but confused,"I thought cast iron was black, no matter what. Then I clean this pan properly after a few uses (it was starting to get a weird smell and taste to the food) and up comes the black and there's silver underneath. Not really sure what this means, but I've kept using it and it seems to be better."
5,great skillet,Served me well for the last 2 months...bit too heavy for people with arthritis or spondylosis..think twice...cooks great...browns beautifully...be careful to follow the instructions and it will last u long.
5,Good value,"Pros: No non-stick, easy to clean, can cook just about anything it it. It was less expensive than I could find anywhere else by about $20 and it came with free shipping. You can use to cook in kitchen and camping.Cons: It's quite heavy (duh--it's cast iron) and I'm a reasonably strong male.I was able to reduce number of pots I used to cook due to it's size. You could probably cook chili in it -- it is large enough.I wanted something I could use for both in the kitchen and camping. I think if I was just looking for something in the kitchen, I would have gone with stainless steel. Of course you pay a lot more for good stainless steel."
4,A great pan for high heat cooking.,I bought this to do high heat cooking that I did not want to do in my All Clad pans. This pan works well for this purpose. The pre-seasoned finish also works well. A great pan for the money.
4,Good LARGE skliiet.,"This skillet is big and heavy. We use it once every couple of weeks but when we need it it works fine. This is replacing our large non-stick skillet and is working out well other than needing a lid, nothing we have will fit."
2,too small!,"Smaller than expected - I thought the 6.5"" diameter would be measured at the bottom of the pan, not the widest point of the lip. This thing is so tinythat I can't fit a 6"" tortilla in it, and definitely too small for scrambled eggs."
2,Buy in a local store and save 21.00 bucks,"Had I realized that they were charging 21.00 dollars I never would have ordered this item, I would have bought it either in a store locally or at a garage sale."
5,AMERICAN MADE,"I went to the Lodge factory outlet in South Pittsburg Tn. This product is American made in a Foundry next to the outlet and employs appx 200 Americans. There is a 2nds area and this skillet is maybe 10$ cheaper, but when you think about the travel time and gas, plus taxes it is not that much cheaper than Amazon. Lodge is a quality product, it is a life time product that does not have a chemical coated inside that will scratch when you use metal utensils. I believe in buying American when at all possible and this is definitely a no brainer when buying cookware."
5,really great cooking,I love cooking with my cast iron skillet's it takes me back to my childhood with the smells of fried fish and chicken
4,Good Skillett,So far this is a great skillet. Have cooked with it and it has even heat and does well in the oven. Would buy again.
1,skillet,i haven't use it yet but am very disappointedthe handle is so small its very difficult to lift it with one handnever would have purchased such a heavy frying pan with such inadequate handle
1,How on earth does a cast iron skillet break?,"This skillet arrived in a smashed box...which worried me, but I figured, hey, it's cast iron, probably isn't bad. WRONG! The handle was broken and the pan was actually starting to crack. Not Happy!"
3,"Great Product, -- Bad shipping","The skillet and other items were packed loose in the box. I realize that they are cast iron, but the DVD's in the same package are not. Remarkably, everything survived; one more shipping zone to travel and it might not have. The box was beginning to look sick."
5,fry pans,"Since I bought these as a gift, I have no way of rating them but trust they would be typcial of any Lodge cast iron pans."
1,Cracked and chipped--D.O.A. Lodge Logic 12 inch,"I enthusiastically ordered this skillet after reading all the positive reviews and looked forward to using it for a lifetime. Unfortunately, it arrived D.O.A. with about a 2 inch crack on the inside near where the pouring lip is. I thought to myself that maybe that is how they are manufactured but then noticed the crack ended with a chip on the top on the other side. I only then read other reviews mentioning these skillets arriving with cracks in them. I'm still in disbelief that a cast-iron skillet was damaged so drastically without even being used. The product is obviously flimsier than expectations and it's caveat emptor with this one. Fortunately, I ordered from AMAZON (and not a third party), so returning an item is easy."
3,Cracked while making pancakes; great pan but now useless,"I had an old cast iron pan since college that I kept on my stove and used daily, cleaning the surface sparingly to avoid contact with water. In a divorce/move, I lost it. This was my replacement. It seemed perfect, but after a couple of months of use, it formed a crack this morning while I was cooking pancakes. Nothing extreme or unusual had been done to the pan; it hadn't dropped, for example, just asked to cook at a medium heat. This is the end of my love for cast iron, at least for a while. If you want this pan, Amazon's price is excellent. But I'm moving on."
5,"Fantastic for camping, cooking over an open fire.",We took this pan camping and it was awesme. It is big enough to cook breakfast for 8-10 people at once. There was little sticking.
5,Lodge Logic is always good quality!!!,This a great size pan for me and my family. All the cast iron I own is Lodge Logic and it holds up forever.
5,Heavy!! Perfect!!,Item weighs about 25lbs. Very sturdy construction. Item feels like it will stand the test of time. Great for braising large portions of meat.
4,Not too bad. Not really preseasoned,"You must cook a lot of fatty food in it to start out. Did my first skittle steaks the other night - utterly fantastic. Took less than 8 minutes to cook, set off all the smoke alrams in the house, but it was the juiciest steak I have ever eaten in my life (medium cooked). I still wipe it down with oil after each cooking and if I ever have the oven on, I put in there for the ride to keep somewhat seasoned. Still not non-stick yet (unless a lot of greese in the pan) so I hope it will work soon!"
5,love it,"I use this pan all the time, I love going from stove to oven, and it is great for individual pizzas. clean up is simple."
2,not flat,"I just purchased this pan here and have used it only once, to cook bacon and sausages this morning.It's not flat on the bottom!!! The grease pools around the edge of the pan.Moreover, it did not cook evenly. Perhaps the diameter is just too great to use at low heat, but I thought the cast iron was supposed to solve that problem with good conduction and heat retention.The surface is not smooth like old cast iron pans, but gritty or sand-like texture. I do not know how this will affect the non-stick quality, but so far, it's not as pretty."
5,Non-stick is not always the best,There are a lot of things that just taste better on a cast iron skillet. Omelets are one of them. Not to mention Hamburgers and Hot Dogs. Just about anything you can do on the grill you can do on this skillet. Just get a scrub brush and use hot water only when cleaning. Also make sure it is pre-heated before you start cooking (about 10 minutes on medium-low heat).
4,useful,The pan is great for frying. It's just so heavy. It's hard lifting it and washing it and storing it.
5,What I'd hoped for,"Years ago I 'upgraded' (young me, then) and got rid of my cast iron cooking pans, and for years I've been sorry, but didn't want to spend more money re-purchasing. Something finally made me decide to buy this one - partially because these days all the pans are pre-seasoned, and partially because this one was made in USA. I've used it a few times so far, and find it is really better than my old pan, and I'm a happy (older and wiser?) person."
5,Had no idea,"I had no idea how much I would love this skillet. I bought this as the same time that I bought a set of cooking pans. I use this skillet so much. Had I known, I probably could have bought this one and just a couple of individual pans, instead of a whole set. I can use it for so many things and I just love the cornbread it makes. I am not going to comment on the seasoning as so many others have already. Just know what to expect and the only suprise will be how much you will use it. I don't think it gives an ""off taste"" to my food at all. Mmmm, now what to make in it tonight?"
4,Very good skillet,"I use this skillet for frying meats and stir frying. Food does stick, but not much. I suggest using a non-abrasive scrubbing sponge and mild soap to clean it. This will eliminate loose burnt particles from getting into your food."
5,Just like Mama use to make,"This skillet is great for grilling, stews,frying you name it.It's also very heavy.But that's a good thing.I plan on buying more cast iron cookware for all my cooking needs."
4,"Lodge-Logic 12"" pre--seasoned cast iron skillet","Just like granny used! Nothing else compares to cast iron...it just does'nt. This skillet is something you could hand down for generatiions. You'll never wear it out, can't say that about much these days."
5,Great multiple purpose skillet,"This skillet is great! It's been used in the oven, on the BBQ, and on the stovetop. Showed up super quick. We love it! And so affordable too!"
5,LOVE IT!!,"After purchasing this skillet as well as a few others from a different maker, this one by far, surpasses the quality I have seen. Perfectly seasoned, cooked great and evenly. I definitly recommend this brand, Lodge, as they did a very good good job all around. Worth the buy over other brands."
5,Best non stick there is!,"My wife and I have been looking for a non-toxic/non-stick method of cooking for a long time. The old fashioned Iron Skillet is it! ""Zero Stickage"" Just ensure you clean and care for the pan as described and it will last a very long time. 5 stars!!!"
5,Great skillet,I love this skillet... I made some yummy bbq ribs in it as soon as it was received. Sadly my skillet came with rust spots but it would be unfair to rate such a great item low due to the sellers irresponsibility. Cleaning this skillet is sooo easy... I will definitely be ordering again
5,The Best,"A cast iron skillet is one of the items that no kitchen should be without. We use this skillet at least 2 or 3 times a week and I do not know what we would do without it. It is easy to clean (water) and easy to keep seasoned (a tiny bit of oil spread over the surface after cleaning), and it will last a lifetime. Buy this."
2,maybe I'm just doing it wrong,"As the title says, maybe I'm just doing something wrong, but I can't seem to get this thing properly seasoned. Whatever I try and cook in this sticks like crazy, and it's just an all around pain compared to my other pans. In theory I love this skillet, but in practice I almost never even try to use it anymore."
4,Lodge Cast iron Skillet,I love this pan however the picture shows a pour spout but there wasn't one when it arrived. Overall it's a great buy but no spout is a little annoying!!
4,Nice once it's seasoned,"I don't know why they say this skillet is pre-seasoned. My test for seasoning is to fry an egg which I did with this skillet when I received it. The egg stuck. I seasoned it and tried again and it was perfect. I have a smaller cast iron skillet which was my mother's until she passed away at 91. It has a wonderful smooth surface. The pre-seasoning on the Lodge gives it a crinkled or bubbled effect. I can't understand why they couldn't have just left it alone, especially since you have to season it yourself anyway. Once you get used to the idea of the surface not being smooth, it's a great skillet."
4,Cast Iron is for a lifetime!,I am recently making the switch to cast iron and can be a strange transition but ocne you follow the instructions everything will be fine. This is heavy and will last a lifetime once cared properly. This came pre-seasoned which is a plus and can go from the fire into the oven. The food taste much better especially macaroni pie.Heat retention is great and cooks food evenly. This should be that last pan I would have to buy as it is indestructable. The handles are iron too so you have to always use mittens once hot.
5,Good Stuff.,"I like Lodge cast iron items. I have many diffrent sizes of these work horses. They are versatile; you can fry, saute, roast. They are virtually non-stick in many situations, provided that they are properly seasoned. Although they are preseasoned, I season them again before using them. This process enhances non-stcik prioperties.This particular size is good to sautee small portions of pretty much anything. Highly recommend them."
5,Got for my Daughter,"I bought this for my daughter. It was hard to find this size and she only wanted a 9"" skillet so this fit the bill perfectly. She loves it."
4,Cast Iron Pots,"Purchased Lodge 12 Inch Skillet and Cover. Used to make Pommes Anna recipe. Though it cooked well had to put the final product under the broiler after removing and inverting from the skillet to brown the ""top"". Perhaps I used too much butter?The combined weight of the skillet and top, especially when removing from the oven after cooking an hour at 400 degrees is a daunting task,and I am close to 300 lbs."
4,GREAT PRODUCT,"This is great--very heavy and sturdy. Pre-seasoned very well. America's Test Kitchen rates this the best. The only downside is the handle is a little short for the weight of the pan. they put a second handle on it across from it and that is almost essential to use when moving it around. I do not see this as too big of a deal but would have preferred a longer handle. I went with the shorter handle, however, because America's Test Kitchen rated this particular one so high."
4,Pre-season again!,"After one use, we had rust forming (we didn't scrub it when cleaning and used no soap) so my advice is pre-season again! Besides that, a great pan - there is nothing better than iron skillet cooking."
5,Great Pans!,I got four of these pans for pazookies (chocolate chip cookies with ice cream and whipped cream on top)! I use them all the time for desserts. Makes great desserts for couples to share and also great pan pizzas for kids!
5,Beware when ordering!,"While this skillet is 12"" across the top, it is only 10"" at the base. The base is what most people use when they measure a pan's size. Note also that the Lodge model number of this item is L10SK3, while their 13 1/4"" pan (12"" base) is L12SK3 -- so even they use the base measurement to catalog their products.I own a 10"" skillet and wanted the next larger size. I ordered this 12"" skillet, and when it arrived it was exactly the same size as my old one. It costs more to ship it back than it did to purchase, so now I'm stuck with two identical pans (plus an order for what I really wanted in the first place). Don't make the same mistake as me!I'm giving the pan 5 stars because they are great pans -- just make sure you ask for what you want."
5,Love it!!!,"This is a product I have longed to buy myself for years! But it's also been one of those things that I always looked at but never got around to buying it. I decided to take advantage of a gift card I received from someone at my job and FINALLY purchase this skillet. It was the absolutely best decision I could have made. The minute I received it, I cleaned it and started using it. Used it twice that day. First I fried some pork chops on it and later that day we made a pineapple cake. This skillet did just fine with both things. The cake came out spongy soft and lifted right off the skillet. I am sure we will make good use out of this purchase for a long, long time."
5,Excellent pan,"Really great, heavy cast iron skillet. It is exactly what it seems to be. Nothing more to say, really. Great product, great price."
5,A Masterpiece of Lodge Production,"For those who complain about seasoning & rusting, you're a bunch of wussies! When you dry the pan, use a cotton towel. If you're a cheapo, use a paper towel; you want to avoid rust to form in the pan after washing. When you season a pan, use olive, canola, or peanut oil; they tend to work best. When you use any of the above oils, use a wax paper to coat the pan; they won't absorb the oil as much as a paper towel would; less paper towel residue left behind to burn."
3,It is large; lot's of maintenance,Owning an iron skillet is truly a full time job; daily and weekly maintenance to properly keep seasoned and rust free.
4,Good Cast Iron Skillet,"This ""pre-seasoned"" skillet comes ready to use, although, as the directions state, you'll need to season it from time to time, especially if you want to cook with only a little oil or if food starts to stick. Because I can't stand the idea of just wiping clean instead of using dishwasher soap, I do wash it, and I still don't need to season it every time.If you are unfamiliar with cast iron, you should know that it is indeed heavy. The main handle on this skillet is a little short and narrow; fortunately, it comes with a gripping handle on the other side for two-handed lifting. You also need to dry cast iron immediately to avoid rust. But you cannot beat cast iron for an even, radiating heat.This particular cast iron pan (12-inch skillet) is deep enough for pan frying, but it works equally well for sautéeing and even griddle cooking.-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann"
2,not impressed,"The first pan I ordered had a hole about the size of a #2 pencil lead nearly all the way through the side of the pan. Amazon promptly sent a replacement. However the new one has several blemishes around the rim. I was able to break off one of the flaws with my fingernail but it left a visible 'scar' on the rim. I realize cast iron pans are going to have a more rustic, less polished look than other types of pans, but these flaws make me think the pans are produced as cheaply as possible with no quality assurance.In any case I decided to keep the replacement but I wont order any more Lodge Logic pans."
2,Warped in the first few minuets on low,"Seasoned twice in the oven with olive oil, looked good. Preheated the pan on the range on low for about 15 minuets and warped... Hot in the middle and cold on the outer rim. Bought this for even heat distribution while cooking; was just the opposite."
1,pops and cracks,Mine popped and cracked like many other reviewers. I bought mine at wally world and could get no refund. It was great until it popped and cracked- I guess the good reviews come from people who have not had the pop and crack yet! stay clear
2,Food sticks every time.,"Whatever this pan comes ""per-seasoned"" with, it does not keep me from having to violently scrape food off of it every time I cook. I even took the time to season it myself (5 cycles in the oven) and it has not made much of a difference. This is not a quality product."
1,not polished for cooking any more,"I bought one of these and it came with a rough sand cast texture. It won't cook without sticking horribly, even with lots of margarine. I contacted Lodge and they said they don't have their polishing machine any more but I was welcome to sand the cooking surface to make it smooth enough to cook on. Save your receipt unless you are buying this skillet as a decoration."
2,Not the heirloom pan I recall,"This is a strange pan unlike the one I grew up with. It ""rusts"" and never seems to get clean. I wash and oil it but I still don't feel like using it because of the rust smell. Is there such thing as cheap iron, I don't know...I would return it but I didn't keep anything. How can you go wrong with an Iron Skillet but I am not impressed."
1,"Poorly packed, cracked","I purchased the skillet as a Christmas gift, and it arrived today with a large crack down one side and into the bottom. It was packed in a too-large box with air-filled pouches on top. UPS didn't have their hands on it for very long: it came from the warehouse about 40 miles south of us, through the distribution center and out to the house in less than 24 hours (via ground)."
3,Small and rough,"Try to find specific measurements on this listing and you'll be disappointed. The 9 inch description on this skillet refers to the top edge, not the base of the skillet.I was disappointed in the surface of this pan. It is very rough. I'm looking for a cast iron skillet like my grandma's, which is smooth on the inside and most of the outside too, making it easy to clean.I don't know how this rough pan cooks and cleans up, though. I sent mine back after I received it."
4,Looks like a great skillet but Amazon fails with how they pack it,"I received this and the handle was completely broken off. The skillet is fairly heavy and Amazon just put it loose in a box with some paper. The packaging didn't protect it at all! I have returned it and will try ordering one again to see if I can get a good one.I'm leary of skillets shipped by Amazon though. They may be weakened due to lack of proper packaging. You may be better off buying one locally because even if it looks fine when you receive it, it could be structurally damaged and end up cracking later..."
5,Very Heavy and Quality Product,"I've never owned an Iron Skillet before and I'm really glad I purchased this one. It's heavy and high quality at a great price. It does take a little while to get to the temperature required for cooking but that is a characteristic of all iron skillets so it can't be penalized for that. You do have to oil the pan before you use it to avoid food sticking to it and I think that is to be expected. There might be a better way to use it that doesn't require oil, but I'm a novice cook at best so I just do what works. Looking forward to cooking potatoes and other items in this!"
5,Every cook should have at least on of these pans in their kitchen,I can't believe I waited this long to buy one of these pans. I got a gift certificate for Christmas not knowing exactly what I wanted. I stumbled upon this skillet (i love to cook by the way). I have every type of pan you can think of but this is now my absolute favorite. I will be using this pan until the day I die.
4,Great but just a little too small,"Lodge makes great stuff. My only desired improvement is that this be just a little larger - say, 7 or 7-1/2 inches."
1,Overpriced,"My local jewelers has this exact bracelet for $450. They offered to discount it to $360.Hoped to find it for less on the internet. Well, not on Amazon anyway."
5,Alice's Tulips,I cried at the end. Such beautiful Civil War writing. You rarely get to look at the war from a woman's point of view. Such evil villans!
2,a disappointment,"This is a story of Alice, the wife of a Union soilder and herstuggles during the Civil War. It is told in letter fashion. We(the readers) read the letters Alice has written to her sister over a 2 1/2 year period. I have read all of Sandra Dallas' works and this was a disappointment. It took story lines out of her other books and placed them in a Civil War setting. The ""letters"" included lengthy quotations of conversations and copies of other letters therefore making them unlikely to be in a letter. There were many explicit references to sex in the letters which were not necessary.It should have been written in a different format. The ""letters"" did not seem like letters. The characters could have been developed better. It was easy to guess the mystery and know what was going to happen next. I would suggest reading Dallas' other works and leaving this one on the shelf. Buster Midnight's Cafe, The Diary of Mattie Spencer and The Persian Pickle Club."
2,Not up to her usual standard,"I was so thrilled when I saw that Sandra Dallas had a new book out, having enjoyed all three of her previous novels. What a disappointment this one turned out to be! It was as though she wanted to publish another book without having to go to much work so she just rehashed her previous books.The best part of the book was the quilting information interspersed thoughout.Don't make the mistake I did and buy this in hardback...borrow it from the library for a light, marginally entertaining afternoon read when you have nothing better to do."
4,"A story of different forms of suffering, perseverance, and love","This is my second favorite Sandra Dallas novel, after Prayers for Sale. It is a story about a wife left behind when her husband goes off to fight the Civil War. As in other times of need and loss, different people's lives overlap and form a new fabric. The most touching relationship is that of Alice and her seemingly standoffish, yet deeply loyal and loving mother-in-law. The resolution of the story, although organic and not at all anti-climactic, is secondary to the events that transpired during the story development. A satisfying read."
5,"If you like historical fiction, you've got to read this!","Once again, Dallas has done a great job fleshing out realistic and memorable characters, from naive, optimistic Alice to her bristly mother-in-law to uneducated, determined Annie, whose path crosses that of the Bullocks when the war devastates her home. The story pulls you in thoroughly, and won't let go until you've read to the end."
4,Stands up well as a book of letters!,"When I first opened Alice's Tulips, I was a bit taken aback, because I did not know that the entire book was made of up letters to her sister. But by the time I finished I knew Alice, her mother, and her sister as well as my own neighbors.The supporting characters of the town are revealed to us in rich detail through the observations of Alice in her letters. We come in contact here with the prejudices of the day, the horrors of battle and some surprising ideas and suggestions from her sister that cross Alice's mind. Something that we surely think now women of that time would not have been so bold to think about.This is truly a heartwarming story, perfect to cuddle up with on a winter's afternoon."
1,Impossible Assembly,"The acorn nuts provided with the press do not fit. They are too shallow and the thread doesn't match the bolts. It cost me more to drive to my local hardware store to buy the correct acorn nuts than the press is worth. Plus, the handle gets hot, despite the promise that it won't."
4,heavy weight,"Great for one big burger or two medium burgers. Easy clean and use. A little too small for bacon though. I am still looking for a real bacon press, no pigs please and please measure 10 to 12 inches. good buy."
1,unuseable!!!,"My grill press was not drilled all the way through on one side where the handle attaches, so at this point it is totally worthless. The package says it is only returnable unopened in original packaging, which of course is not the state of ours, since we opened it to use it. We are currently trying to figure out how to either finish drilling through the cast iron, or I will try to get amazon to take it back and pay for the shipping (since spending $10 to ship a heavy cast iron grill press back makes no sense)."
4,Good press but bacon cooks very fast,I searched for a long time for a good bacon press. I read other reviews and chose this product. The Lodge original finish grill press does work well- though I warn you to lower the temp and check the bacon more often!! I overcooked the bacon the first time that I used it.
3,These didn't work well for my child,"My child had a really hard time using these as they are small and the forks don't really pick up anything. i saw a lot of good reviews on this, but they didn't work well for us."
4,Good for lunches,I bought these for lunches and they work well. I am not thrilled with the underside shape but my little son doesn't seem to mind.
5,"Very durable, washable and I highly recommend them!","My daughter is now 3 1/2 and we still have some of the first set that I got at a baby shower for her. Very durable - I just throw in the dishwasher! We still use them because she loves the colors and they are very functional. The new baby spoons are really too small, but I have bought them also. This is a great product and even great with toddlers and up."
3,Inaccurate Description,"I bought this item from ""BargainCell"" - and while it is the correct cable type, the amount of pins on the DVI end of the cable does NOT match the amount listed in the technical specs. If you look at the image for the product, there are 24 ( + 1 ) pins on the DVI end, which would confirm the technical spec.The technical specs listed ( at the time of buying ):""right_connector_type: 24 pin digital DVI""However, the cable I received has only 18 pins on the DVI end!"
1,Junk cable,"Don't waste your time and money on this cable. It's junk. The HDMI plug does not fully insert, and the cable does not transmit anything."
3,it has potential...,"I received this book as a Christmas gift. There are lots of pretty and delicate designs in the book and I like how the author finds many different uses for a few basic embellishments however every card in the book is a 5""x5"" card - the dimensions/scale are planned for square cards as opposed to rectangular cards. I also thought more illustrations would have been helpful in some cases. I don't think a beginner card maker would find this book very helpful."
5,One of my all time favoite card crafting reference books,Love this reference book. Clean beautiful and inovative cards. Go back to it time and time for inspiration. One of my best purchases for crafting cards.
3,Designing Handcrafted Cards: Step-by-Step Techniques for Crafting 60 Beautiful Cards,"There is really nothing I see so special in this book that I have not seen from the internet so I am giving it a 3 star. After receiving it, I browsed through it and it ended in one of my bookshelves hoping one day I might pick it up again for inspiration. Or give it to my dear daughter-in-law for inspiration."
2,The Twins Could Have Done Much Better,"The book is pretty boring. The text is lacking, and skips anything in depth about these twin dudes. The pictures could be so much better. They really skipped over the Joe Magazine affair of their lives. Too bad, as that was the best of the Brewer boys as far as I am concerned. It was real, and heartfelt - this book is not."
1,Brewer Twins,All around crap and a book that is like a poor Abercrombie and Fitch catalogue. I wish I would have looked at this in a bookstore prior to purchasing. It is sitting on the top shelf of my closet!
5,Review of Scotch Filament Tape Dispenser,Very sturdy and cuts the tape nicely. My last one lasted 10 years and was still going strong until I lost it.
3,Western Audubon Guide,"A good book to take with you because of it's size but, to me, the photos of the birds are lacking. Although they do accurately display the bird they are lacking in detail and often, to us, don't show alternate views for better comparison and easier indentification."
5,This is a great field guide.,I already have this guide but needed another set to put in my vehicle. The photos are top notch and the descriptions are fantastic. It even covers similar birds and points out the way do determine which bird you are looking at.
4,Field book,"Easy to thumb through pictures and then go to text reference pages. Tough cover for the field. Good pictures with multiples for some of the immature, female/male and seasonal differences of plumage. My only complaint would be no range maps and instead has a discription that is very broad. The reality is birds are where they are and in migration it is all variable anyway."
5,Nat. Audubon Society Field Guide to Birds,"I purchased both western and eastern bird books. They were exactly what I wanted and needed. I am very pleased with the pricing and quality of the books, thnx"
5,Hardly needs my review but...,I love all these books. I remember using my moms growing up and it was the first thing I looked for when I moved to a new area and wanted to get to know the birds on my back porch. Perfect for the seasoned bird watcher or the novice.
2,Treasury of Kahlil Gibran (English and Arabic Edition),The book is in English language only and has no Arabic language as the title saidPaper quality is oldand the image of the book do not agree with the image on Amazon web site
5,Great early book about abductions,"This book predates Intruders by the same author and Communion by Strieber. It paints a scary picture about abductions and might keep you up. Discusses many cases in depth. Although I find abduction stories hard to accept, this book details a few impressive cases with nice illustrations. A classic for any UFO library."
2,Reality Check,"This book is just OK..rather blah compared to other books on the subject of collage. Before buying this book based on the previous review (which was written by a self-promoting ""fine art collage artist"" who's work is included in this book) Go to a library and look inside to see for yourself. Honestly, I found nothing new or exciting to make this worth the money. You can get as much inspiration by looking up the word *collage* in a dictionary. I do give 2 stars for the attempt to reach a larger than typical audience of this art. And to the crafters out there, don't let anyone talk down to you about your ""level"", creative spirit is fabulous any way you express it."
2,Unsatisfactory biography,Based on lots of hard to believe theories and speculations. No serious research. No good documentary material! Not worth watching!
1,Bad Book,"I think that the book wasnt that great. I felt that the book could have been written with more thought and more time. dont read the book if you dont absolutly have to. i think that everyone will agree with me about this, the people that will agree with me are: Tim Papa, Sam Martin, Vincent DeCeaser, and some others that have read the book."
1,There are many better books than this onw.,His Screenwriter's Workbook is much better than this crap. He's like the John Patrick (check out gambling books) of screenwriting books. I think he has no clue on how to write a screenplay.
5,"Yeah, I like it","I guess I've drank enough coffee this morning to write a review about a book - you know this isn't your regular book, it's like this portal into the world of scriptwriting. I was assigned to purchase this book for my scriptwriting course here at the Art Institute of Jacksonville and I feel very fortunate to have had this opportunity - ok, so if you think i'm still full of crap, just know that this book is an interactive book. I can easily read a section of the book and watch the movie after finish reading it. It really follows the story and explains how the writer and director worked together to make the movie. Well, thanks for reading this - If you're on this page then you should probably click add to cart because it gets to your house super fast if you buy it new and no - i am not a representative for amazon - just a film student.thx"
1,don't be fooled,"The reason Mr. Field uses other writers' screenplays as examples is basically because he doesn't know how to write a screenplay himself. Considering that, how can anyone take this guy seriously? This type of so-called advice will only fill your head with bad ideas and ruin you for years to come. Instead, I suggest, you look up writer/directors like Joe Carnahan and find out how they did it and what they have to say. Listen to talented and accomplished filmmakers who are actually doing it (and then devise your own system), but stay away from guys like Syd Field who has never written anything that was produced. I truly believe this guy's misguided advice will only derail and hurt the novice movie writer."
2,Disappointment at the bottom of the sea,"About 5 or 10 minutes of undersea photography of sunken ships. I believe 3 ships, one of which is rolled over so you get to see nothing but hull, 10 minutes of ""oh no, we have a problem in our submersible"", like I care, and the rest is like Guadalcanal Diary which is fine if that's what you were buying which I wasn't since it was supposed to be video of ship wrecks. Quite disappointing overall."
1,I wasted my money.,"If there is anything that this DVD doesn't do is teach you how to make professional television programs. I teach TV production and I thought I might be able to use this DVD as a visual aid in my video production classes. Unfortunately, the only thing the DVD is good for is to demonstrate how NOT to make TV. Don't focus the camera yourself, let the camera think for you. Her lighting is bad. She edited the DVD herself and you wouldn't want to learn her technique. The sound continuity is terrible! The typography reminds me of a bad church bulletin. Bless her for trying, but this video is suitable for home movies only."
2,A lovely pan-with a flaw,"This is a lovely, well-made pan-but it has a flaw. Each cake I've cooked it it has overflowed into the oven through the funnel. The first cake I cooked was a homemade pound cake, so I thought maybe there was too much batter, which was strange because I had cooked this cake in a smaller bundt pan with no problem before. Then I tried a box cake mix and the same thing happened. Now, why this happens with this pan and not my other bundt pans is a mystery to me, especially since this pan is actually larger. It has to be in the design. The next time I am going to plug the hole with a piece of foil. If that doesn't work I am giving up on this item because I am tired of cleaning my oven!"
5,Beautiful and Moist Cakes,This Bundt pan produces a lovely rose shape cake that is moist through and through. It is well worth the price.
5,Beautiful cakes,"Love this pan. The cake was so beautiful. Spray it well with a baking spray, and let it sit for about 10 minutes when it's done. The cake easily came out of the pan when I tipped it onto the plate."
1,This pan does not work,"I have tried to use this pan over and over, and it does not work. I have coated it with every type of non-stick grease I could think of, and the cake completely sticks every time. It even takes 3 - 4 washings in the dishwasher, plus hand scrubbing to get the pan clean again. I keep trying to get the pan to work because it was an expensive gift from my daughter, but I've given up."
1,Wrong item shipped,I ordered this item specifically because it shows in the picture that they are 2x. I was shipped TDK 1-16x. My recorder won't work with anything higher than 4x before firmware upgrade. It is an Emerson dvd-vhs combo. I you are looking for a disk that works in that model these won't. I have no use for them but I have used TDK disks if I can find them in the write x...
5,Pleasantly Surprised,I ordered this item for a spare bedroom because I didn't want to spend alot of money on the furniture. My teenage son picked it out but I thought the finish in the photo looked cheap. I was afraid it was going to look as cheap as the price. I was surprised that it has a very nice finish and doesn't look cheap at all. It is very sturdy and works great. I also purchased the standard frame from this website. Very satisfied with both items.
2,I can't believe I finished this book...,"At the same time I can't believe I started this book. About two hundred pages into the book I reached a dreaded point; the point where you are not far enough into the story to actually accept giving up on the book, and subsequently the point where you are too far to accept the fact that the first two hundred pages were a waste of time. The character development was non-existent. I didn't even feel like I knew these people. The ending was even worse. It was as if the author got to a point and finally said, ""this book is long enough, let's end it here,"" and snap!, the book ends just like that. I gave the book two stars simply because I finished it. All I can basically say is do not waste your time. There are too many other great (even good) books out there. The catch phrase on the back cover quotes Publishers Weekly as stating, ""A writer to watch!"" I would respond by asking, ""What book they were reading, because this one ain't worth a cent."""
4,Pretty ring!,"This is a cool spoon ring--it's unique (in a good way). I bought it for my best friend for Christmas...hope she likes it. The sizing is a little small, just FYI. :)"
5,Outstanding!,"When I seen this ring I knew I had to have it! When I got it, It was more beautiful then I ever could imagine! Spoon rings are really differant in so many ways.You feel proud just to wear one! I'm glad that I chose this one to be the first of my new collection of spoon rings."
2,Shoddy effort,"Although ""DSL for Dummies"" contains some useful information, one can't help but feel cheated by its extremely poor organization and inflated size.The information in this book could have been presented clearly and concisely in about 40 well-written pages, but to make it a book the author and editors have resorted to simply repeating the same information over and over (not in an edifying way, but in a copy-and-paste kind of way). In fact, much of the book has nothing to do with DSL but instead constitutes a list of all the great things one can do with the Internet.The most annoying part is that all of this has less to do with incompetence than a calculated desire to inflate the size (and price) of the book."
