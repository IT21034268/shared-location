3,Great camera but not durable at all,"Lovely camera, great photos while it lasts. Fits wonderfully in your pocket. But that's exactly the problem--the camera seems to be extremely heat or moisture sensitive. Though I was careful not to carry it with anything else that might scratch it, small ""blooms"" or spots gradually form on the LCD display and inside the lens, ruining both the viewfinder and the pictures. Perhaps this is the reason they have discontinued this model."
1,"Works OK for a while, get something else","Great small size, picture quality good for its size, but not for the price. You can get better pics from disposable cameras.LCD is poorly designed. There is no case, and no protection. The frame is thin and weak and flexes easily so the LCD is designed to break, it is just a matter of how often you use it. The LCD on mine cracked when I pressed the MENU button, which is too close to the LCD.Not worth repairing -$200 to repair. What a joke."
1,not a cold weather bat,"While the feel of the bat is good. The overall endurance is poor. I bought this bat new last week to use in a weekend tournament and the bat only lasted three games before the barrel was dented bad enough to be declared unuseable by the umpires. Almost every hit resulted in a dent. It was below the 60 degrees that the warranty warns against, but none of the other bats used by my team sustained that much damage."
2,Hit or Miss,"I've had these a number of times and my most recent attempt was an utter and complete failure. The amount of water recommended wasn't enough to hold my falafel balls together and they came out dry. I suspect this is why they fell apart in the oil. Also half an inch of oil in the pan is really insufficient if you want to make normal sized falafel balls. Even at one inch in diameter you would have to flip them over to cook both sides of the ball. This also results in a partially cooked interior.Taste wise these are rather unspectacular. Any half decent restaurant falafel will be better than these. But then again what do you expect for something that comes in a powder form.I say try making your own from scratch. It's not easy to find a perfect mixture that won't disintegrate, but when they are good they are divine.In the meantime I'll continue looking for another prepackaged falafel option."
1,Falafel you say?,"Hands down, this is by far the WORST Falafel I have ever tried. I have been eating Falafel since I was a kid and this doesn't even come close to taste to falafel. Please do not purchase, it is a waste of your money. I just threw mine away in the garbage. It taste's like fried dirt! :|"
4,beware of pre-greeks bearing gifts,"This belongs to the Ancient People and Places, notable for both content and their pleasing and useful format. Nearly all of the evidence is from funerary sites. There are a few remnants of villages.Sicily long stood on the crossroads, a witness to links that stretched from Troy to England. Under the Phoenicians, connections reappeared.Solid, unwilling to speculate, and thus not as exciting as some would wish."
5,Collection of nine action-packed sport stories....,"From the Ali-Frazier ""Thriller in Manila"" to the U. S. hockey team's stunning Olympic win, these nine stories capture the excitement of some of the most electifying episodes in sports history. Meet the athletes who shook the world, people who battled against impossible odds. Relive the struggles, the triumphs, and the glory."
5,a wonderful addition to your meditation yoga practice,"This is now my 1st choice for my yoga practice. It is the most beautiful cd to listen to and I find myself picking it for each of my yoga classes. You won't be sorry, the entire cd is wonderful!"
3,Interesting book,"Enjoyed reading this book after seeing the film on a nostalgic cable channel. Good writing as it put you right there ""down under."""
5,A fun book,My daughter has been reading this book since about 6 months ... the tabs on the pages make the pages easy to turn for little hands and she loves the bright colourful illustrations. She is now 2 and still loves it and loves counting along with me as I read it over and over (and over and over) again. It's a permanent fixture in our car so there is always something to read on a car trip. A must have for Little People fans!
4,Well-made,"I would have given 5 stars, but the ear tufts were lop-sided and we had to trim them to make them look pretty. Otherwise, this is our second Folkmanis product and it is very well-made. We just got a bit of a defect."
3,Folkmanis Owl,"Somethings don't seem to fit together quite right. The materials exceeded my expectations, but the way they're assembled did not."
5,Educational for Science Lessons,"A great tool for classroom learning. The puppet I did receive was slightly damaged (can't see one eye) however, I chose to keep it because of the lessons coming up."
3,"Nice, but somewhat scary and dark.","I have bought this puppet as a gift for a 4 year old. Based on its picture on Amazon I expected it to be more colorful. When it came, it looked kind of dark and shapeless. The eye movement was easy to do, but since the face was almost invisible, it was not so much fun. The head rotation function worked fine. It was kind of hard, even for an adult, to do flapping motion with the wings. I suppose for an older child, it might still be nice to play with, but I would not recommend it for a very young child. I ended up returning it."
4,Knowledge at Your Fingertips,Great series of books with knowledge that our forefathers had and used daily. I feel with the way our government is spending we will fall into a chaotic world and need to return to the old ways to survive.
2,Foxfire 11,"I have and have read Foxfire 1-10, and found them very informative and enjoyable reading. Foxfire 11 is not up to the standards of the first 10 volumes. The details are really lacking and it's just a superficial look at a few things. maybe they're running out of material, or the people to interview? In any case it's not bad reading, there is just not much to it. Fortunately I did not pay full retail."
3,Decent,"I really like the simplicity of these. They are clear, with the once charcoal strip on the lid. It is much easier to see what is inside when you compare it to other Rubbermaid storage containers. However, these are not made of the same matter as the other Rubbermaid containers and can break. Considering the cost of these compared to others, I would have expected better."
5,FANTASTIC,This is a wonderful toy for the child who really loves horses. My Grandaughter has had so much fun with it. I would recommend this to anyone who knows a child who loves horses and has a good imagination. thanks for getting it to us so quickly.
5,Excellect Horse Stable,This Horse Stable is great for children. It's size is huge an construction is very durable. I would recommend this toy to anyone looking for a toy horse stable.
2,Disappointed,"When I received this stable in the mail, part of the roof was chipped. Called Amazon and was told that they could not mail me that part, but told me to call the manufacturer. Manufacturer did not charge me for the part, however, I had to pay another 11.00 for shipping.When we put the stable together, some of the pieces of wood was warped. My husband had to glue many of the pieces together. The roof didn't sit right. The design for this barn was poor."
1,Great - if it was constructed properly,"This stable looks to be fantastic in the photo. After pulling it out of the box, I realized quickly that there was a flaw in the fabrication process, making it impossible to put it together as instructed. I contacted the manufacturer, Maxim, and they concurred that it was defective and that ""they have received a few calls"" about this item. Huge disappointment, and what a pain to box it all back up to ship out.BTW, description says no assembly required - that is incorrect. It's not complicated, but you do need two people to put it together."
5,more than satisfied,"This barn is awesome! Easy access for make believe play, easy assembly, all holes lined up perfectly.Front and back stall openings. The fence is very durable and stands easily. This barn should be fun for many years.Very happy with my choice and the price. It was well worth it. I have seen $200 barns at the tack shop and this barn far exceeds expectations."
5,A Heart Warming Collection of poetry for all to enjoy,"I must write of how much I enjoyed writing the poem about actor, Jeff Bridges, in this beautiful collecting of poetry. It is a book for both the young and old. These short, but brilliantly written poems by people from all walks of life, will open your eyes to a world of unknown adventures, both true, and fictional. The emotions contained in the pages of this wonderful book will make you laugh, cry, and bring a smile to your lips. When you're in need of something relaxing to do after a hard day, I suggest you set down with a good poetry book, such as this one, and something to drink, kick off your shoes, set in your favorite chair, and read to your heart's content."
1,THE EMPEROR HAS NO CLOTHES!!!! ITS A PRODUCT OF A SCAM!!!,"(...)EVERY POEM WINS AND GETS PUBLISHED THATS HOW THE SCAM WORKS! THEY MAKE A BOOK OF THIS [stuff] AND THEN TELL EVERYONE IT IS TO BE PUBLISHED AND THEN YOU EVEN TURN AROUND AND BUY YOUR OWN STUFF BACK FROM THEM!You are basically paying to have your poem put in a book. I remember when I was a child my brother had a childrens book made from a template where you have the publisher write the childs name in all the places of the main character. They ordered it,paid, and it was delivered for my youthful enjoyment. It was neat then. (...)(...)"
1,I was one of the poets,"I wrote a ""A Rainy Day Mist"" and had it published in this book. I also purchased a prepaid hard copy back in November of 2003. I am still waiting on my purchase order? I have called a few times to ask what happen to the book that I have ordered and was told that it was still being printed and that I would be sent my book once it was completed. Well, I am still waiting? It's Oct. 19, 2004"
3,From a Writer of a Famous Poets poem,"I wrote ""When-One-And-Twenty (The Ballad of Aggie H.)"" in the fall of 1997 for a poetry class at Arkansas State University. I was 21. I had just lost my first job: columnist on the campus paper. It meant a lot to me. In a fit of melancholy, I composed a heartfelt ode to The Herald as if it were a woman, my allegorical lost love (the paper was known in the early days as the Aggie Herald, hence the title). In it I spoke of a betrayal by a jealous, lying rival, with whom Aggie is now with. I asked her to come back to me; I begged for forgiveness and to be embraced again to her ""inky breast"".Five years later I submitted it to be published in this anthology. I dedicated W.O.A.T to the copy editor whose filthy, hateful mouth cost me a career in journalism."
4,"Classy, but wobbly","Not being much of a whiskey-drinker, I use these for water and iced tea. They're very elegant-looking and have a pleasing weight.The only problem is that they rest unevenly on flat surfaces, with only 3 of 4 corners touching at a time. The result is that they can seesaw a bit. It's a minor imperfection in otherwise excellent glassware."
3,Packing Problems,"These are nice glasses, but the packaging is inadequate, one glass was broken. I wish Amazon would send me one glass rather than sending all back, because I am sure that others will break."
5,Great glasses,I bought a few sets of these and the matching 14oz taller glasses. They've been great. The design is nice and simple and there is a good weight to each glass. They tend to get banged around and we still haven't broken any. Highly recommended.
4,"Good, not perfect.","These are really great looking and very affordable, but a couple of mine don't sit completely flat...there's a slight wobble. They're also REALLY heavy. Easy to forget about your grip after you've had a couple. Regardless, I'd buy these again in a heartbeat."
3,There Ohkay,I recieved these maybe about 3 days after I ordered them and I was disappointed about what I recieved.3 of the charms were torn and 2 of them were dirtyThey were not brand new and seemed to be used
1,Some great ideas wrapped in too much padding,"I'm a big fan of ""Dynamics of Software Development"" and I expected this book to be 10 years better than that. It isn't.It's like buying a favourite band's new CD and finding that you really liked the old work in the days of vinyl. And the CD collects dust.I bought this book and tried to read it many times. I've willed it to be engaging, I wanted it to be good, I've given time over to reading it, but it's not engaging and feels bloated.Sure there are some great ideas, but they're fighting to get out of the ""stuff"" around it.Looking forward to the next book Jim. I hope it's the one I was looking for."
2,"We're humans, not machines.","Most people don't work the way Jim wants them to, don't think that way, and they never will. There're myriads of things in the way of sanity when developing intellectual assets as a part of collective efforts. Yes, we're inherentily egotistical and inefficient. However, this ""OS"" will not help it. The success of collective efforts will continue to be determined through the good old positives (leadership, drive, personal charisma, excellency of communication), productive negatives (challenge, competition, need for $$$), unproductive negatives (fear, intimidation, anxiety)... and a lot of luck. Not through the protocols and behavior agreements. We're humans, not machines. Since we're humans the only real help we can offer ourselves is investing in our human growth."
5,Excellent Book About Becoming a Real Estate Agent,"This book is fabulous for anyone that is thinking about becoming a Real Estate Agent. Written by a millionaire Real Estate Agent, the author researched a lot of very successful Agents and distilled the formula for success. This book is a detailed plan on how to become a Millionaire as a Real Estate Agent from someone that not only successfully applied all this knowledge to himself but complemented it by studying other people that are also high achievers. This book is fascinating to read, entertaining, full of decades of experience. You don't have to re-invent the wheel, all you have to do is follow the clearly and easily detailed road map to millionaire. I am doing it and it is working."
4,"OK read, but not groundbreaking material","I'd say buy and read it, but don't expect amazing revelations. The premise is to hire more people to do the work for you. That wil free you to do grander things or dream them up. Keep 100% of what YOU earn or keep 50% of what 5 others can earn FOR you."
4,The Millionare Real Estate Agent,"I am currently 3 weeks away from finishing my Pre-Lisc Real Estate requirements and sitting for the State Exam. As a soon to be new agent, this book has been very inspirational. It shows you to learn from other agents/brokers who have already been through the same challenges I am facing and to become successful by following whats proven to work vs reinventing the wheel. Its a simple but smart concept. This book can be for already successful agents to get to the next level or new ones alike. Love it!"
5,IF IT IS TO BE WHY NOT ME? Or even YOU,This book has changed my way of thinking. Gary Keller and Dave Jenks do a remarkable job of mapping out the path to netting over a million dollars. I am currently reading this book for the second time and I plan on reading it ten more times. Our team has made some serious changes after reading this book and we are seeing the benefits and how easy it can be accomplished. Remember we are all in the Lead Generating Business. I wish you all the success after you follow the MILLIONAIRE REAL ESTATE AGENT Book.
4,A Primer on doing business,"There are many books available that address sales and marketing for the real estate agent but very few provide solid advice on how to run a real estate business. This easy to follow book provides information that, if applied will set any agent apart from his peers."
4,Great Insights!!,I think it gives you a common sesnse approach that will quick start you in your carreer. Evry agent should pick it up. I beleive I picked up a couple ot items that will be crirical to my success.
1,Watch who recommends this book!,"This book presents a new paradigm for real estate and should be required reading for real estate professionals everywhere. -Robert T. KiyosakiThat this book is even mentioned by someone let alone the very person, Kiyosaki, should tell you not to get this.Mr. Kiyosaki's book (Rich Dad/Poor Dad) is filled with the sort of information that any person who has been in any business for any amount of time will tell you only leads to disaster. For more information on Mr. Kiyosaki and why I would not recommend any of his books or any books he recommends, I invite you to visit www.johntreed.com/kiyosaki.html"
2,No Specifics - Very Little Substance,"Book is mostly fluff and really misses the mark about becoming a ""Millionaire Real Estate Agent"" - many of the ideas are not fully developed and others are just simply outdated. There is better out there."
5,Loved it years ago.,I read this years ago and loved it.I saw it this afternoon as I was cleaning my office and I just might read it again.It's a wonderful book and I just decided I am going to read it again.It's tough out there for a lot of people and being in real estate sales is certainly a bit challenging.
4,Beginning Agents Read this Book! Actually All Agents Should Read This Book...,"If you are just starting out in real estate, invest the money on this book. While its not a 'step one, step two, step three"" type of book, it does lay out clearly how top agents have succeeded. It will give you the foundation for building a phenomenal real estate career based on all the right things: planning, focus, persistence, expertise, and great customer service. All thats left is to do the work!"
4,Millionaire Real Estate Agent,I have been in Commercial Real Estate Sales for 35 years. This book is great for a beginner or reminding and picking up pointers for an experianced agent as well.Steve CookCornerstone Commercial Investment Properties
4,GO GETTER,"Fantastic book and easy to read. It is chock full of good ""commonsensical information"" that one can and should use to further their respective career. Great Book!!"
4,READ ME! Great Marketing ideas,"This has great marketing ideas on how to show your listings throughout your particular niche, whether it be condos, waterfront, land, commercial, etc. For instance, setting yourself as an expert in your community with the local press about a specific niche will help you in free advertising. This is a superb book covering good ground for any real estate agent or even real estate investor.Other supplementary real estate books:Investing Without Losing (ISBN: 0978834607 NOT on amazn, on other stores)"
3,Disappointed,"I was disappointed in this book. Though it is filled with geat information, I felt the majority was about how to hire an assistant. I know to be a highly successful agent you need staff, but I was hoping for a book that did more to explain what the 'normal' agent (who doesn't yet have assistants) could do to improve their business."
3,A BUST FOR ME,"Maybe it's because I've been in the real estate business for many years, but I frankly didn't find this book of any value to me. Perhaps it is best read by someone who is just joining the business for the first time."
3,A business guide only!,"If your looking for a book to teach you how to become a Real Estate agent, prospecting, scripts that work etc., then this is not the book for you. This book gives a model to follow, a business plan on how to run your real estate career as a business. It stresses how to think, what to think and how to stay structured as yourbusiness grows. There are no real practical ways shown on how to get business or any sample letters or practical advice that is proven, it just states that it is a numbers game, and you have to stay focussed and go for it. I was dissapointed in this book. The reviews I read about it were misleading. They stated that this is the only book you would ever need and it is the complete authority on becoming a real estate agent. It is not, as I stated it is just a business model not a teaching tool."
4,Real Estate,A great book on how to get started in the real estate business. Everything you need to know is in this book. I would recommend all realtors starting out in the business read this book.
5,Great for a started Agent,I love how this book explains that its ok to feel overwhelmed and that you don't need to know everything before you begin. What they focus on is giving you steps and strategies on how to begin your business.
5,Best Book I've Read for Real Estate,"Whether you are an agent or a manager, you will find this book to give you a road map to success. Out of all the real estate books I have read, this one gives you the focus and steps necessary to achieve your goals. This was, by far, the best investment for my business.~Michelle Fradella, Broker - Picayune, MS"
5,Great Book!,This is a must read for any agent. It contains the necessary elements an agent must be aware of and the actions an agebnt must take to be successful in real estate running it as a business.
3,"Rookies, Take Note!","This title is for the novice in the business. The basic principles that Keller, etc. provides are not for the agent who wants to expand his business.....so buy another title."
2,"Okay, now what?","I bought this because of fond memories of the 2099 series way back when, but reading these one shots wasn't the most fun. As another reviewer mentioned, the Daredevil one may have been the best, but when you get to the end, you can't help but wonder what the heck is supposed to happen next? Some may like the stories, but for me it was a little dissapointing."
4,Great Guide But A Repeat Of Meyers' Other Book,"This is an excellent guide if you want to pass the A+ DOS/Windows exam, but it is basically just the DOS/Windows' chapters excerpted from Meyers' ""All-in-One A+ Certification Guide"", so if you have the one, you won't need the other. personally, I recommend the All-in-One book as it contains all the information needed to pass bothe Core and DOS/Windows exams. This book also contains no practice questions, which is a big minus. Still, Meyers' explains things so well, that you are bound to pass the exam with this book. As usual, he goes into much more detail than you will actually need for the exam, but it does often come in handy."
4,This book reigns!,"I aced the DOS/Windows test after using this book for about 2 weeks. I would rate it a 5 if only there were a few practice questions. If you read this book, the test will look familiar to you!"
1,"What the heck is a ""vook""?","Surely a typical spell-checker would question the spelling of ""vook"". Attention to detail is a must in this industry. Just as I would dismiss a resume from a potential employee for misspelling, so I dismiss a product labeled ""vook"". Get your stuff together!"
4,DLP TV.,IT;S A GOOD UNIT. SEEMS TO BE WORKING ACCORDING TO THE SPECS.I WISH IT WILL NOT TAKE TIME TO WARM UP FROM THE THE TIME TO TURN IT ON.THE ORDER AND DELIVERY TIME WAS EXCELLENT. AND SO THE PRICE.
1,I have to agree that this book is very poor,"I, too, starting working on computers in 1991 and own dozens of computer review books. ""A+ Certification Study Guide, Fifth Edition"" by Michael Pastore needs to be removed from circulation.Certainly news to me, and Intel, that the Pentium III is available in Socket 478, a contradiction to author's prior statement that all P2s and P3s were SEC (Slot-1), or that prior CPUS didn't need heatsinks (yeah, maybe the 286).That's just an example from Chapter 1. I'm sure I'll find a multitude more if I can stomach the rest of the book - there must be something useful in it."
1,Disappointed,"I used to love this product and was so happy to find it on Amazon. I ordered three bottles so that I would have enough to last. Unfortuantely it came in a poly envelope and one of the bottles had ruptured and leaked all through the packaging. The remaining two bottles have a very strong alcohol smell, it smells exactly like rubbing alcohol. This is an Aveda product that I used for years, it had a wonderful essential oil smell but what I received was nothing like the product used to be. My theory is that the product is either spoiled and they are still selling it, or someone is just selling something completly different in an Aveda bottle. Please do not waste your money on this."
1,not that great,"I have never had a problem with MadCatz before I got this memory card. Every time I try to save on it, the system thinks the card is corrupt. I have to tell the gamecube not to format it, and then it will try to save again, and it works... but it is a pain to have to always tell it not to format my card."
1,DONT BUY!,"Madcatz memory card for gamecube.. dont waste your money, i can also testify of things being deleted, i had mario power tennis, a winter sports game and NHL 04 05 and 06 about 2 years of saved data on that card, still lots of memory left too, and the other day i go to load a dynasty mode and its gone!!! i checked the memory card, it self deleted everything i had ever saved, now i just feel like buying a new gaming machine thats better than game cube and start over with that cause i dont want to start over with games that took me 2 years to get to that point! sooo frusterating!"
2,Tyrosine???,"I took this under dr supervision to reduce panic attacks/anxiety. I was taking between 3-5 tablets a day. I had rapid heartbeat, trouble breathing, and incredible anxiety. Everyone I spoke to said it can't be the GABA. This product has Tyrisone in it so its not pure GABA. I feel vindicated but it made the last two weeks miserable for me. I recommend plain GABA if you have an anxiety or panic disorder. Why the Dr recommended this to me is beyond me."
2,don't think it works,"this was promoted on a few websites as working for panic attacks by blocking neurotransmitters....after it did not work for me, I noticed that on other websites it states that it cannot work in that way....wasted money. was hoping that it worked.....save your money....."
2,Mediocre,"I have pretty serious anxiety, so maybe its just me, but I don't think these things work barely at all. Maybe like 10% relief. I've read that GABA in this form isn't even able to be really absorbed by our bodies, so maybe that's what the problem is. I even tried a different product with a larger amount of GABA in it and still nothing. Also the sublingual tablets take forever to dissolve. Wouldn't buy again."
2,gaba calm,I tried gaba calm for about a month 2 tabs a day and can't really say i notice any difference. It might work some as for me i won't buy again i'll stick with eating gaba rich foods like almonds and theanine from teas
2,Which automobile is this for ?,I was looking for transmission oil pan for my car and reached here but I dont know will it fits my car or not? here is not enough informaton about this item.Is it fits all transmissions like manuals and automatic or any car of any brand.
5,A great book for all,"This important coletion of items brings forth the vitality of present day Mexican art. The traditional techniques being applied to the new expression is facinating. Even the most rudimentary objects become important works of art in the hands of the artisans whose work is exhibited in this book.I have personally seen some of these objects being manufactured. That was also memorable, the presentation in this book is a veritable tribute to the artisans that preserving their traditional manufacturing are making art with some of the most menial substances."
2,For Those Interested In Oaxacan Woodcarving,"This is a big, general overview of many different forms of Mexican folk art. An artist is profiled with a few examples of their work, a write up, and photo portrait. Everything is reproduced in color, glossy paper, a large sturdy book that's a nice general survey.My main interest in Mexican folk art is the woodcarving from Oaxaca. The cover of the book is of a Oaxacan carving which drew my attention the book. However, for those interested in Oaxacan folk art, this book only profiles a few artists of the genre (the Jimenez family being one of them).Out of the 500+ pages there are maybe 20-30 pages on the painted woodcarvings and for that reason I only gave the book 2 stars. For a broad, general survey of Mexian folk art this is a good book. Those looking for in-depth examples of Oaxacan art won't find much in here."
2,Meet the idiot half-brother of Max Payne....,"This is one brainless shooter. No story, no plot, on easy mode - you get close to a million enemies, silly graphics, even sillier sounds of the guns.The only part in this game which really frustrated me to the max was the Rooftops, final level when you fight the helicopter. Beyond that, this game is just diving and firing and getting your dog (shadow) to act as your bodyguard.Not even worth to rent or borrow. Buy if your really need to release some tension or are an arcade deathmatch freak.a very generous 1.5 stars."
1,Dead to Wrong!,Let me just say that this one should not have been made. It's nothing like the first one. It falls short in all aspects. The story line the graphics and just all around feel of the game is a dud. I was really disapointed that they put this out because the first one was such a pleasant surprise to me. I would pass on this one and just play the first one it's a much better game.
4,A good Tajiri,"[...] this figure is fine. If you don't like the mist you could use a little paint thinner and take it off. Otherwise he looks great, from the design on his pants to his articulation."
3,This story kept my attention...,I kept waiting on something fantastic to happen. sometimes the book was too predictable. I think it is a good effort but wasn't deep enough. I liked the characters in the story and would not mind sitting down with them for a glass of sweet tea.
1,Beach Reading,"A sweet but superficial and sentimental story. While it has enough plot interest and character development to pull you along comfortably I found that it is a totally ""forgettable"" book. I agree with another reviewer that this book is similar (in evocative plot-style )to writing Kaye Gibbons but I feel it lacks her grace & wit.This is a v.good book for airport or beach reading....I wish I had saved it for that!"
3,What is the hype about?,"ok. This was a decent read. No more. if you've read stuff by Maya angelou, toni morrison, etc then you end up feeling like a lot of the language and events are just a teensy weensy bit a copy of something that you've read before. The coincidences didnt work for me and I'm sorry to say I skimmed the last two thirds. No big surprises. Some nice images and writing but nothing to get all worked up about."
5,WONDERFUL!,"I loved loved loved this book! It was delightful and entertaining and I could not put it down. My husband who has never read a book in his life, is having me read him this one!And then I read ""Running with Scissors"" immediately following and now am ready to throw up. I must read more of her books NOW!"
3,beeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee,"The book has great reviews all around. The author is an interesting piece of work. She writes with a flourish and I swear, I became for a little time the little girl that was main character.I could the south through her eyes growing up and found joy in her first dose of ""forbidden"" love. I did have to flip through a coupole of pages because the word would be ""boring"" but overall the author did put in a good effort."
2,whats the big deal?,"I had heard so many great things about this book, I was like WOW, I totally have to read it. So I read it. Boring, annoying, an hour and a half of my life Ill never get back."
3,A Great Read for Girls and Boys Alike,"The back cover of this book describes it as ""a remarkable novel about divine female power, a story that women will share and pass on to their daughters for years to come.""Had I read that before buying it, I would've probably skipped over to a manlier read. Thankfully I was running late at the airport and needed to grab something/anything quick to keep me entertained for a 12-hour flight.The Secret Life of Bees tells the story of what it takes to be a strong and independent woman in the midst of poverty, racism and family discord. It's set in South Carolina in 1964, but isn't bound by that period - as much of the issues addressed in the novel unfortunately continue to exist today.The Secret Life of Bees may not be the best choice for adults, but makes a great read for teenage girls and boys alike."
2,Metaphor made no sense,"The more time passes and the more I think about this book, the more I really do not like it. It started off really well, but then the more she got into the Black Mary stuff the weirder it got. I was an English major, I'm used to metaphors. But this was over the top and honestly made no sense to me after a while. It was just weird. Almost like trying to have a metaphor for the sake of having one, not really meaning anything. At least the weird ceremonial part anyway. I could grasp the Black Mary metaphor but not all of the other stuff. I tried my hardest to understand what the author was using all that for, but I still do not get it. The ending was very anti-climactic too. It was very quick, and disappointing. Almost like the author ran out of steam, or was just ready to end it.All in all, the first half of the book was great. The last half was very disappointing. Two stars."
5,Poignant story,This is a beautifully read and well-told story of a 14-year old white girl looking for love and answers in the home of three black sisters operating a bee farm in South Carolina in 1964.
4,Sweet sweet touching book,"Read most of this in airports, laughing out loud and crying more than once. Some of it is implausable but I was happy to go along for the ride.Loved the imagery...loved May and her wall most of all. Scared to see the movie...how can it be better? (The only reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 was that the second half of the book was remarkably better than the first half--and the first half was wonderful!)"
2,PC and schlocky,"Sorry, but I found this book to be nauseatingly pedantic, pc, and simplistic. The characters are fairly black and white- nearly all of them are 100% good or 100% bad, until about the last 50 pages of the book. And the women are without exception 100% good, loving, nuturing, and non-racist in the 1960s South, and all but one of the white men are 100% evil, brutal, violent, stupid, racist, and disgusting. I have news for people who love this book- that is not the way people are- they are revolting stereotypes. The prose is pretty flowery too; Southern Gothic yes, but Carson McCullers she is not."
3,Resistable prose,"I kept putting off buying and reading this book... having finally done both, I understand better my hesitation. The writing is heavy-handed and the messages literally pounded home with an ""listen to this , this is important"" approach. While the concepts that Lily faces are compelling ... abandonment, abuse, sense of self, loyalty and truth... there is little mystery surrounding her thoughts or the people around her. ""Heart is a Lonely Hunter"" is a book that ""The Secret Life of Bees"" has been compared to and ""Heart"" is a book to read and again for nuances and beautifully crafted writing. ""Secret Life"" hits you over the head and stands there to make sure you got it."
2,Bad TV movie material,"This book is one long extended cliche--from the young kid in the south who helps a black person escape injustice (Mark Twain did it slightly better) to the wise black person who becomes a mentor (this has been done so many times, it's not even worth discussing) to the heavy-handed symbolism and the dialog, which sounds like it was written by a grade B TV scriptwriter.In terms of literary significance, this book is about on par with _Bridges of Madison County_.Pass this one up and re-read _The Heart is a Lonely Hunter_."
4,Great summer read!!!,"I thought this was a great read.If you are looking for something easy and short to read for summer then this book is for you.The characters are great and you feel like you ""know them.""I highly recommend this book."
2,Rare moments of brilliance,"I found the novel easy to read; simple writing with a rare moment of insight and brilliant description. What bothered me most with the novel, as with many novels that try to make a single point, is the extremes portrayed in characters. Why do men have to be portrayed as absolute jerks (with rare, weak exceptions) and women the strong, loving, insightful characters? In my world both types of people are represented in both sexes."
5,A Novel of Comfort,"My English teacher recommended the book and I absolutely loved it! The book is full of unexpecting surprises and really focuses on the need for compassion and love. Readers follow Lily on her journey for truth and freedom from her cruel father, T-Ray. She finds this truth and escape in the Boatwright's home, living with May, June, and August. THe novel is truly uplifting and genuine. Definitely a must read."
5,Wonderful,Can't remember when I read a book I enjoyed so much. Wonderful writing style and lovable characters. Would love a sequel.
4,Secret Life of Bees,I LOVED this book! It was very southern and I loved reading something with that dialect and culture. This book is wonderfully written and I would recommend it highly!
5,Praise for Secret Life...,"The Secret Life of Bees is an excellent novel that anyone and everyone can enjoy! This book is filled with touching and brilliant adventures that thrilled me. From beginning to end, I loved this book and its story.Lily, the young girl in this book, has a moving and mysterious story that opens the eyes of readers. This novel shows that love can come in all shapes, sizes, and people. In the setting, African Americans are still discriminated against and thought of as ""lesser."" Sue Monk Kidd proves that anyone can overcome their differences and love one another. This book is a must read that will make you want to read more about Lily's life beyond her days at the calendar sisters' honey house!"
2,A little overrated...,"I heard great reviews on this book, but I was a bit disappointed to say the least. The first part when Rosaleen and Lily ""escape"" to Tiburon kept me interested and was quite well written. After they arrive at the Black Madonna pink house, it quickly became unrealistic and fantasized. I was a little bit frustrated that Lily didn't just tell the Boatwrights her story sooner - I mean they took her in and provided everything she needed and she could have told them after all they did for her. The whole ""Mary in Chains"" thing was a bit strange as well, quite unbelievable. The best part of the novel was Sue Monk Kidd's Southern writing style. Her writing really captured the essence of the South in that time period in the best way possible. I'd only recommend this to those looking for a slow-paced Southern story that's a little over-fantasized."
2,readable yet nothing special,"I agree with those who said this novel was overrated. I bought the book in an airport, with few other selections to choose from and read it one evening on vacation. I became so bored three fourths into it that I skipped ahead just to find out if anything really tragic or interesting happened.I guess I bought the book because I don't like mystery or romance genre novels, and this book had the most appealing cover art. The author crafts a fine sentence-- but the plot was annoyingly derivative of all the other ""quirky yet reslient, abused, southern teen comes-of-age"" novels currently being touted as ""literature"" (as a result of Oprah Winfrey's old book club preferences no doubt). This kind of novel should be clearly identified to warn those of us who are tired of the genre. I also agree with the reviewer who said the nearly-conflict-free second half of the book was pure fantasy, and not the interesting kind."
5,Heartbreakingly beautiful book,"I fought picking up this book due to blurbs I had seen in reviews. Then someone gave me the unabridged CD's as a gift - and I recall actually stopping the car on the way to work to replay parts over and over again. After listening, I bought the book, so I could SEE how the pages were paced, and Kidd's rhythm in writing.What I have to say is this: this book is so hauntingly beautiful, it hurts. I smile. I cry. I get all choked up over the wonderful tale - and the way it is written.I have since purchased three sets of CD's and two books to give as gifts. I highly recommend this book (understatement) - esecially for other writers, and those readers whose hearts are in need of filling."
2,"The bees were interesting,,but","I hate to be the killjoy but I did not particularly like this book except for the bees. I guess the stereotypes of the vicious white man, the noble black man, the all wonderful women and so on just tire me out. A little overdramatic, a bit trite, lacking depth of character. I might say one ought to read it just to see what one thinks but life is short and there are so many other books. Especially on the south, on women and on race."
2,6th Grade reading material,"Although this book told a pleasant enough story, I found it reminiscent of the type of books I used to read when I was 10 years old: sweet plot, characters with little depth, and an unrealistic picture of a time period. I felt almost guilty for actually finishing this book - and insulted on behalf of many of the charachters. The stereotypical personalities, along with the lack of anything more than a superficial attention to the nuances of each, gave an impression that that they were no better than a group of simpletons. It's possible that this all got edited out to make it a shorter book, but if so, they should edit some of it back in. My advice to an adult looking for more than beach reading is to select something else."
2,oh paleese!,"Although this was a charming story, I found myself saying ""oh please"" too many times. It was too sappy to be believable. I don't understand how some reviewers would want to follow the characters lives in a sequel. I was glad to have them gone.On another note: I'm reading ""The Red Tent"", am 1/2 way thru and it is *fantastic*! I don't want it to end! :)"
3,"hard to get into, but good in the end","I picked this up after hearing such rave reviews from friends and in papers. The story line was interesting enough and the characters were likable and believable. I had a tough time for the first 50 pages or so getting into the story, but once it got going, it turned out to be well worth the read. The story has such a sad premise and you really root for these characters. I would definitely recommend it."
1,Definitely Overrated,"I find it sad when a piece of mediocre literature, such as this book, is exalted to the status of ""classic"" and it now being spoken of in the same category of other great Southern masterpieces, such as To Kill a Mockingbird.This is merely a simple and silly story without any real plot line, a rather strange view of Southern life in 1964, and stereotyped characters. I give the book one star for the writing, as Kidd does have talent--it just seems that she doesn't know what to do with it."
3,The Secret Life of Bees,"14 year-old motherless Lily Owens lives on a peach farm in Georgia with her abusive father and black nanny, Rosaleen. Lily has vague memories of her mother who was killed when Lily was 4 years old. Lily holds precious the few belongings she has of her mothers. One belonging is a picture of a black Madonna with the inscription""Tiburon, South Carolina"" written on the back.After Lily's black nanny, Rosaleen, is beaten and jailed after trying to register to vote, Lily is inspired by the inscription on her mother's black Madonna picture to break Rosaleen out and head to Tiburon. A journey of escape from Lily's abusive father, a journey of escape from the unjust law for Rosaleen, and a journey in search of her mother's past.It is in Tiburon that Lily meets the ""calendar sisters"", August, June and May Boatwright. These sisters are also the town's beekeepers.It is here, with the calendar sisters, that Lily learns about motherhood, her own mother and about life."
5,I was impressed,"I usually don't read this kind of book. I had to read this for school. At first I didn't like it, but as I read on I was drawn into it.I cought myself feeling sorry for Lily and despising Lily's father at some points in the book. Beautiful full story, and magnificent ending. Its an all around great read."
2,honey is sweet and so is this novel,"Sue Monk Kidd's novel is a mildly enjoyable read. However, with limited reading time, there are many, many better choices. I read this as a member of a book club and would definitely not rate it as one of our better choices. The novel lacks complexity. Its characters are predictable, lacking real ambiguity. Overall, I felt that this book was mediocre at best. It seemed as though I had read at least a large part of this story somewhere else before. One senses that the author is borrowing from the experiences of other writers rather than telling us about her own. However, there is ample tragedy in the book and a recovery towards wholeness. It is indeed a hopeful book. However, one gets the overall feeling that the book is just too sweet and fluffy. It is preferable to much of the junk fiction sold in America; however, it is certainly not good fiction. But if you want a midly sappy book that will appeal to the tender-hearted, this might be for you."
1,Completely unoriginal.,"I had high hopes for this book. But I found it to be irritatingly predictable: abused and neglected white child saved by strong black women, set in times of racial strife. It felt like every other work of Southern fiction I've ever read."
2,Cliched,"Haven't I read this book before? No? Well, then it just feels that way. The Secret Life of Bees is another Civil Rights era coming of age story. Here it tells of how a girl on the cusp of becoming a 'woman' is taken better care of, and is better nurtured, by black women than she is by her white father. It is a book that furthers stereotypes while purporting to expose them. It left me feeling disturbed -- and not in a good way."
2,Bored.,"I was so excited about reading this book. Heard great reviews but in the end, I couldn't get passed the middle. I was bored. The writing is good, the story is boring."
5,Great Story,"I LOVED this book. I could not stop thinking about the characters and hated to put the book down. This was a quick read for me. I fell in love with August, Lilly, and Zach! I didn't want this book to end. Everyone should have an August Boatwright in their life. The movie was great, too."
1,OPRAH I WROTE THIS BOOK FOR YOUR BOOK CLUB,"Horrendous rag of a ""book"", please do not waste your money on this heavily contrived book. Also known as: another elite white person making a lot of bucks dealing the race card.Am I the only one who has noticed this book has cleverly been designed to appeal to the Oprah book club set? It seems as if Monk Kidd deliberately set out to toot all the bells and whistles to appeal Oprah. This book is not plausible in any shape or form. The worship of the Ship's figurehead is just too far out. All Monk-Kidd needed to do was add about a hundred cats and it would have been purrfect.I would have liked to see more character development and a realistic story line, well no that is not true; actually I would not like this book in any form - even with Belgian chocolate smeared on it and inch thick.I would not recommend this book to anyone over the age of 14.If this is all it takes to become a famous author: WATCH OUT WORLD HERE I COME!!!"
4,Great characters.,"With ""Secret Life of Bees,"" Kidd does a nice job of creating characters that drive the story, rather than vice-versa. If you're tired of plot-driven novels with thin, and often cliché, characters, then you're likely to dig this one.If you're into writers like Sue Monk Kidd, Yann Martel, Mitch Albom, etc., then there's a new writer you should check out: GREG IPPOLITO. His most recent novel, ""Zero Station,"" is a politically charged page-turner that pits its main Gen X character (John Saylor) against his Baby Boomer parents, teachers, etc., during the winter of 1991 -- in the heart of the Persian Gulf War. Right now, Ippolito is still a relative unknown (a friend turned me onto his work)...but this is a must-read. You can check him out and read an excerpt at:http://www.zero-station.netDon't miss it."
3,Judy Blume's Margarate Simon verses Lily Owens,"I laughed outloud and cried with Lily.I picked up this book only after hearing an interview with the author. I didn't read it until my sister, an avid classic novel reader, said she enjoyed it.The book was slow to captive, but hard to put down once the character's were clear. I fell in love with the character of Lily and admired the wisdom of August (""August chewed more than she bit off"".).Lily was delightful. August is what every woman would like to be.Diana"
3,WHAT'S ALL THE BUZZZZZ?,"Not a bad effort but ""Ellen Foster"" much better writing and afar more endearing character.Also, terrible job by this novel's editor.Could have easily cut this in half."
5,One of the best books ever!,I am an avid reader and this book is in my top 5! The words flow like honey and the charaters suck you in right from the start. Please pass this book to everyone you know. FYI - I didn't care for her other books.
1,Worst Book Ive Ever Read!!,"This book was absolutlely horrible. I have to agree with one of the other reviewers quote ""In case of fire, throw in"". Charcters were all one dimensional, writing was on a grade school level and the book only seamed to criticize men. After reading Middlesex, Virgin Suicides and one of my new all time favorite books Life of Pi, this book was terrible.The book is about a girl named Lily who lives in a fantasy world where everything falls into place like in a Utopia or Eden like world. She escapes her monster like Father to live another life with three other woman after escaping her and her live in maid out of jail to another part of North Carolina. From there, it becomes the silliest garbage you have ever read. MEN, DO NOT READ THIS BOOK!! I will never read Sue Monk Kidds books again. Thank God I am done with this book!!!! Good Morning America rated this book as a must read. I rate is as a must not read. If I could have rated it a zero, I would have."
3,I don't like reading,I got the book and it looked brand new. That was the good thing. I just hate books and had to read this for school.
1,Could not get through this,"This was such a bad book I had to write a review.It took me 3-months to get through it, i just couldnt read it nor could i leave it without finsihing it.The characters were not developed, and the whole magical blacks thing was stereotypical.The abuse she supposedly fled was not developed, the mothers motives, persona etc were not developed, I did not feel sympathy for the main character at all and the time line was way off as another reviewer noted. You think weeks or months have passed and its been a few days.Might be manageable or an ok read for junior high level, other than that, do not read."
3,A good read,"This book was both interesting and touching. Sue Monk Kidd takes you on a journey of a young girl trying to figure it out. It came together nicely at the end and left with a warm feeling inside. If you are even just thinking about reading it, do it, you will be glad you did."
3,Pretty Good Book!,"Well, someone gave me the book to read or I would not have chosen it. I prefer a differnt type of book but really enjoyed Monk's work overall. The abuse was handled very tastefully and you did really come to care about the characters. Well written and the link to the bees was very clever. Good Job overall and I recommend it."
4,A feel good mother-daughter tale...,"While I found this book a little on the simpler side, read-wise, I really, thoroughly enjoyed it. It is a heartwarming tale about the bonds females possess with their mothers and daughters and heart-wrenchingly describes the ache that is felt inside when such a bond is lost. The author struggles a little with her time line which can leave the reader confused as to how much time has elapsed, but in the end leaves those that have experienced this kind of love with a warm fuzzy feeling as Lily reflects on the loss of her own mother, discovers the power of forgiveness and learns she has gained more mothers in her new friends than she could have ever hoped for. The author has a beautiful way of exposing the nuturing nature of women and leaves the reader generally content."
5,I'm glad I finally got around to reading this,"Such an easy-to-read yet captivating story. One of the best books I've read all year. If you haven't read it yet, treat yourself. Now!"
4,BitterSweet,"This book was very sad yet extremely moving. It was also a little bit happy, in a quirky kind of way. READ IT!!!!!!!!!!"
4,What a wonderful rich story,I thought the story was well done. The character background was fleshed out so well that I actually thought them to be real people. I thought the author caught the whole time frame very well. I highly recommend this book for a book club read.
3,Good for the under 17 crowd,After reading some other reviews I thought I would really like this book but I'm 30 years old with kids of my own. I think my former 14-18 year old self would have really liked this book. I can imagine it being great for introducing the era of the civil rights through literature for the high school crowd.
5,A beautiful story,"The thing that struck me most about this novel was Kidd's ability to create such amazing characters. They were incredibly real, vivid, and original. Anyone who enjoys southern gothic tales and beautiful figurative language will love this novel. It's the perfect story to read with your mother, sister, or daughter."
5,"Story of Life, Problems, Love, and Decisions","Sue Monk Kidd is a great story teller. This is a book of women, mothers, friends, love, life, disappointments, tragedy, decisions and everything else that happens in life.I could not put this book down, I had to know what happened next. I finished it yesterday, I hope Kidd has a sequel in mind for the characters.This is a story of how love finds you, sometimes by chance. By love, I'm referring to a family-type of love, not a romantic love. There's a lot of history on beekeeping, some interesting facts, thus the title ....I recommend this book for ""easy"", not heady reading. It's nice to read something a little lighthearted."
2,quite dull,Not on my favorites list... plodding and dull... couldn't find anyone interested enough to pass it on to....
3,highly unlikely but entertaining,"The first line made me cringe(bees do not fly at night), the anachronisms can be distracting(dollar stores), and sometimes the author just tries too hard. In spite of these annoyances, I found the book an enjoyable read. Anyone looking for a modern classic should be disapointed, but for a few hours of entertainment you could do far worse!"
3,racial sterotypes?,"Although the author seems to find some beautiful moments in the book (particularly the bee scenes), I found ""Bees"" to be very overrated. Many of the characters seemed to be racial sterotypes (Rosaleen, Lily?) and the writing to be mundane. It seemed that the author was trying to show how Lily was examining her own prejudice, but it felt shallow and simple. I was looking forward to some story about intense female empowerment, bonding and celebration when it turned out to be more of a ""Wow-look how those lovely black women accept the young white girl"" story. Maybe the problem was that I had just finished ""The Rent Tent"" which I found to be extremely moving, well-written and feminist. I'd recommend that book way before ""...Bees."""
3,I Didn't Get It,"Frankly, I just don't get the hype on this book. Not a terrible book, just didn't interest me that much."
2,"Huh, I guess I missed something",I love reading and love a good story. I didn't find that here. I was hoping for something more cohesive. The plot lines didn't meld together as I would have liked.
4,"A Beautiful , Fully-Realized Story","""The Secret Life of Bees"" is a book I wished I had read at 14 -- the age of the protaginist, Lilly -- but one that I still truly enjoyed at 31. It is a great coming of age story, a beautiful book and a very satisfying read. The writing is luminous and precise. One thing I particularly enjoyed is that the author makes the characters acknowledge their own shortcomings and limitations in a way that promotes their growth. In that way it is a very inspiring story, and unflinching, not holier-than-thou. (Although some of the character's word choices towards the end of the book seem sermon-like.) Best of all, the character development is fully realized -- you really get a sense of Lilly's whole person, which is unusual and refreshing for a modern novel.I would recommend this in a heartbeat to anyone who values excellent writing and is looking to be inspired by a book. But grab some tissues, the going gets rough!"
5,My favorite book in many years!,"If you need a story that will transport you to a place that will ultimately warm you to the toes, this is it. I recommend this book to all my friends. I find this to be a really healing book on many levels. I've read it over and over to completely absorb all of Kidd's imagery and brilliant depth of characters. She is a very rare writer who truly knows how to make a story come to life! I highly recommend this book!"
4,Took away my fear of bees.,"I loved Kidd's poetic use of words, and the details she tucks so nicely into her sentences. I loved the unusual beehive setting and analogies for Lily's thoughts and lessons in life. I must admit to rushing though, even skipping, some description toward the end, especially after May left for her wailing wall. I was anxious on every page to see what would happen after Lily confessed to August.Having said that, I was surprised by the mild mannered conflict between blacks and whites at that period in history. I held my breath after Rosaleen's spitting, and Zach's bottle throwing incidents. I figured there would be bloodshed, but no. Maybe Kidd downplayed the violence to keep her readers tuned into her main story of Lily. Personally, I appreciated it. I read it in bed every night and didn't want to turn out the light with horrific visions of racial persecution."
3,Secret Life of Bees Review,"Sue Monk Kidd did an amazing job with her first book! This book was one that I had a lot of trouble putting down, and when I wasn't reading it I was distracted thinking about what would happen next.Secret Life of Bees is about a young girl who lost her mother and her journey to peace with it. She has always had a deep longing for her mother and adores her mother because she knows that her mother adored her. She escaped from her abusive father to find some amazing African American women to stay with. She learns of thier connection to her past and to her mother.The book was set in the 1960's and I think it showed me alot about life in the south in the 1960's. It has so many twists and turns and is a really great read. It was a beautiful story about the love in a family and what family really means."
5,Great book!,"This book is incredibly well written. The descriptions of the places and smells make you feel like you are there, the feelings and descriptions of suffering are real, the stereotypes are broken and the story keeps you constantly wondering what is going to happen."
4,Lovely Story,"This is a wonderful coming of age and female empowerment story. It takes place in 1964 South Carolina amid the Civil Rights Movement and tells the tale of a 14-year-old white girl who learns about love, justice, and family. Truly heartwarming."
5,Secret Life of Bees,"The Secret Life of Bees was an excellent book. It is a book that readers of all ages will enjoy. Sue Monk Kidd has an excellent style and tells a breath taking story of a young girl trying to fit in.Lily, a 14 year old white girl, runs away with her African American nanny, Rosaleen, to find her roots, in Tibourn, South Carolina. After a tough childhood with an abusive father and a deceased mother, Tibourn, South Carolina is just the sort of warm and welcoming enviornment Lily needs.The relationship that Lily has with the three sisters and Rosaleen is heart warming. The 5 women love each other and would do anything to help one another out. The story shows how listening to your true inner 'bee' can really be to your benefit.The ending of the story is quite compelling and inspirational. It is a wonderful book that i suggest for all readers."
3,"Honestly, I can't remember what it's about","Well.....it was okay, but not very memorable. I read this for bookclub and well.... it was not discussed much. But it was not a terrible book, some of us liked it. The main character was pitiful and I do remember feeling sorry for her. I did enjoy learning about bees."
2,very disappointing................,"Okay, everyone at work RAVED about this book and how great it was (even a couple of guys) so I decided I HAD to read this during my summer vacation.Let me tell you one thing about this book: it does NOT live up to the hype. Book clubs and others are really talking about this book and many people told me they just couldn't put it down. I did not have that problem.Sure, the idea is an interesting one: white girl runs away with a black woman in the south, right around the time of the Civil Rights Act. It was very predictable and dry. Yes, I learned some interesting things about bees, but this is one book that, after reading it, I felt like I'd wasted my time. I kept waiting for something BIG to happen. The book is 302 pages long, so around page 282, I decided that it probably wouldn't happen and it didn't.Very predictable, like I said. Give me a James Patterson novel or something from Mary Higgins Clark. At least their stuff keeps me guessing until the very end."
5,Great book,"The Secret Life of Bees is a heartwarming story about Lily's need to feel validated and loved while enduring physical and emotional abuse as a child. The racial bigotry of that time adds to the raw hurt which each character lives with in their own separate circumstances. Additionally, each character grows and learns about the power of believing in a better life through their spiritual beliefs. The bees themselves represent the simplistic order and beauty that life can offer and also the power that they have. I strongly recommend this book."
5,"Porch Swing, Country Quilt Story",A truly lovely story... you just fall in love with the characters.. they become real to you... the story simple wraps itself around you and your life.. just like an old warm country quilt....
4,Definitely Fiction But Enjoyable,"This book flowed from chapter to chapter. Although it wasn't completely believable, it was an enjoyable read."
3,Beautifully written but Boring.,"The authors writing and description of the characters, feelings and surroundings is beautiful. But then......it just under delivers. Disapointing."
4,Wonderful Book...,"What a fantastic novel! I am so in love with the story and with the characters that I cannot wait to see the movie on 10.17.08. Sue Monk Kidd is an amazing writer and story teller. When you are reading you will actually feel like you are in the story. I gave the book 4 stars instead of 5 because I wasn't exactly thrilled about the ending, but other than that I LOVED it."
4,Just finished re-reading,"I read this book a couple of years ago and recently came across it again on my bookshelf. My latest order hadn't arrived from Amazon and being desperate for a good read, I picked it up. I'm glad I did. This book is just as enjoyable as when I read it the first time. I love how the author faithfully captures the time (the deep American South) during integration.A warm and funny book that holds up well."
3,The Determination to know the Truth...,"A little slow in the middle of the story, the kid Lily who lost her mom at an early age decides to run away with her black friend ""stand in mother"" to a close town in South Carloina where she gets to know more about her mom, and how she was killed...An entertaining book, that descirbes the racism that existed at that time, the friendship that brings this white girl to spend a summer with her new black older friends, and the strong will that Lily had in order to find more about her mom, and the truth...A nice story to read if you have the time..."
2,I wanted to like this,"I read this book for a book group I am in and I really wanted to like it. The character of Lily was the best written one in it, but only when dealing with coming of age issues. The rest seemed contrived at best, cliche at worst. I think the writing was good when the author had real experience to base the writing on. There are many books that explore the issues in this book better and in a way that makes the characters have more depth and be more believable."
4,Realistic Characters,"Lily, the daughter of an abusive peach farmer, runs off with her Nanny, Rosaleen, after hearing something very disturbing about her deceased mother. With little idea on where to run to, Lily decides to go to the town that her mother had written on the back of a picture of a black Mary. This idea leads her to the answers of her biggest life questions.What makes this book so great is how realistic the characters are. Susan Monk Kidd does a beautiful job of showing the various and complex sides of each characters personality so the reader really feels like s/he has met these characters by the end. All of the characters actions throughout the book are realistic, and the dialogue is great. Definitely a fun, quick summer read."
4,"""Sweet Honey in the Rock""","This is a wonderful first book, full of interesting characters and experiences--with an added bonus that it introduces us to the fascinating life of bees. It made me want to learn more about the ""secret"" life of bees. I gave this book only four stars because some (if not all) characters are just too unbelievably good or bad, there is a certain lack of just simple humanity in them. But it's a very charming, entertaining book to read!"
3,A good book to read,while the story is unrealistic and do not in any way reflect the true struggle of african american during the 60's with racism - the book do keep you interested enough to want to know what happened next to Lily. I agree with other readers that this book should be for younger readers then adults.
4,Coming of Age,"I thought that this was a wonderfully written coming of age story. It describes how a 14 year old girl finds inner strength with the help of strong, capable, nurturing women. Lisa's need to know if her now deceased mother loved and nurtured her dominates her life, preventing her from feelings of self worth. Her father constantly diminishes her self esteem, exacerbating her feeling that she in unloved and unlovable. With the help of her nanny and the Calendar Sisters, she finds out about her past and comes to terms with her mother's death. Setting the book in the south of the '60's, in the midst of the struggle for civil rights, adds to the coming of age context. I think it is a terrific book for teen-age girls, as well as adults. I am not certain that it is a man's book."
5,Absolutely Wonderful,"This story took me by surprise. I wasn't prepared for it to be as delightful as it was. It is filled with strong and amazing women struggling to find beauty and meaning in a life that is filled with ugliness.This book would be excellent for young people. It tells the story of 14 year old Lily who runs away from her hostile and abusive father to try to find out the truth about her mother and the day she died. Everyone has told Lily that she accidently killed her mother at the age of four. Lily's father told her that the day her mother was killed she had come back for her things and had run out on Lily.While trying to find the truth about her mother, Lily finds the truth about racism, hate, and violence. She finds the truth about love, faith and kindness."
3,just cute,"I actually give this 3.5 stars. Just b/c its a very cute colorfully written book. The only compliant I had was that a lot of the ""moments"" in the book were pretty dull or not very interesting. But overall its still a pretty cute and warm story. Just don't expect it to grab your attention once you start. Definitely light reading."
4,Enjoyable,"Very enjoyable book and a fairly quick read. Love the descriptions of the bee keeping. The character development is good, and I find myself thinking of those beekeeping sisters even now - 2 months after I finished reading the book. Thumbs up."
1,boring and trite,"this book had promise for about 10 pages, after that I could have cared less about any of the characters who were all stupid cliches."
1,Book Club Fodder,"It is difficult for me to undestand the praise this book has recieved. It does not deal with a new issue (female empowerment) or an old issue in a new way (female economic/communal life). It does not press on the English language (flying = freedom, female as producer and queen bee) or introduce us to new ways of thinking (a white character marvels at how her urine is the same urine as that of a black character; I honestly laughed out loud at this retake on the ""common blood""). It is, in short, appropriate only for a book club that requires that everyone be beaten over the head with the theme, and trades understanding for learning; I wish book clubs weren't about feeling empowered but about actually coming to a new, challenging experience. Read Barbara Kingsolver's Pigs In Heaven, Toni Morrison's Beloved, or Jhumpa Lahiri's Interpreter Of Maladies for better books that concern race and womanhood."
3,Horrified!,"I was simply horrified after reading this. It is a complete rip off of another novel about southern white/black little girl with bad familial situation. Read ""Ellen Foster"" by Kaye Gibbons. It is exquisite, and obscenely better than ""The Secret Life of Bees""."
5,The Secret Life of Bees,I listen to audiobooks often (I have a long commute) and have never enjoyed one more than The Secret Life of Bees. The reader is even better than Jim Dale in the Harry Potter series. Her tone and feeling of the book is perfect and the accents are wonderful. The story is terrific and I think it is better enjoyed as an audiobook than actually reading the text.
4,Who knew bees were so entertaining?,"This is a great read! Kidd manages to put the reader into a turbulent time (1964 SC), but pull you to the outskirts. The reader almost forgets how unusual the situation is (white girl living with African-American women in 1964 SC) because it just works. I feared the end, but walked away with a smile. I hear Hollywood is making the film. For once, I look forward to the movie version. If it's half as good as the book, it will be well worth the outrageous ticket price."
4,"Quick read, good voice","I have to say, I don't always enjoy the books that everyone raves about, but this one turned out to be quite good and well-written. I can see high school english teachers giving this as a summer reading assignment in the future. Hopefully the movie will be just as good."
4,Alcoholics uses and abuses,"I choose to read Alcoholics uses and abuses.This book is written by Margaret O.Hyde.My book talked about how alcohol can be used good or bad.In this book you will learn that a drink for a special occasion is ok,but drinking to much or overdose can be bad to your health and to others health.I liked this book because it told me how just one little drink can be like a huge bottle of whatever.I find that cool because if someone thinks there cooland drinks a lot to show off then they will make a fool of themselves and at the same timesomeone who drinks a little bit and gets just as drunk as the person who drank alot.Alcohol can be good sometimes too because when someone comes home from work and feel the need to relax,they drink one or two beers or any kind of alcohol,which is fine as long as you dont overdue it and remember friends dont let friends drive drunk take there keys.One of the best known quates in the book is ""dont drink and drive""."
1,What? Bees?,We hate bees they like to sting us and take away our flowers. There is too many bees in the world big or small. They still hurt. I was stung by a bee yesterday because of your book. If I wasn't reading that book outside I wouldn't have gotten stung. Its all your fault!!
1,Couldn't get through it,"It is hard to believe there are so many readers who give this book a glowing review. To me, it seemed as if the author was more intent on creating quirky, off-the-wall characters than in telling a good story. I finally had to put it down about 3/4 of the way through due to the apathy I felt for each and every character in this sappy book. Oh, and the reader that said it was ""alot like Gone with the Wind"" should probably go back and take another look at GWTW."
1,Another lightweight,There are too many books that offer the reader the challenge of complex characters and good development. Don't waste your time with this one if you're up to the challenge of what good literature is all about. This book was an insult to the intelligence and imagination of the thoughtful reader. The author too often explains the character's reactions without allowing the reader to come to personal conclusions. What ever happened to thought-provoking! Not much for discussion here.
5,What Will Hollywood Do To This Great Book?!?,"I loved everything about this book. A page-turner with a wonderful spiritual overtone -- nothing hitting you over the head. Great Characters. However, I won't see the movie. Concern about the industry ruining a good thing. And seeing Dakota Fanning in the role? After her last controversial movie! Her parents should insist that she leave the business and become a ""regular"" teen-ager, whatever that means."
2,What a disappointment,"After having this book recommended to me so many times, I finally got it. What a disappointment! This coming of age novel doesn't even come close to the quality of the books it has been compared to -- say, Elizabeth Berg's Katy Nash series, Kay Gibbon's Ellen Foster, or Connie Mae Foweler's ""Before Women Had Wings."" It seems to me like maybe Kidd is trying too hard be that kind of writer. If so, she's widely missing the mark."
5,One of the Best Books I Have Ever Read!,"This book was perhaps the best book I have ever read, or at least the best novel I have read in a long, LONG time. When compared to some of my other favorites like A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, Rebecca, and Pride and Prejudice, it beats them hands down. This book was ten times better than Divine Secrets of the Yia-Yia Sisterhood. It just makes you feel all warm and fuzzy inside. From beginning to end, this book is a masterpiece that needs to be read by everyone! I love this book and strongly recommend it to anyone, any age!"
2,Disappointed,"So much hype about this novel. I thought surely I'd love it too. Wrong. Although the writer tells the story through the eyes of a 14 year old girl, to me it seemed to be written by a 14 year old girl. I recently read The Plot Against America also told through the eyes of a child, but a far better writer, a far better storyteller--Philip Roth. His novel was literature; Bees is just a mediocre story that should be shelved in the library in the junior high section."
2,Predictable,"Most of the book was repetitive in terms of what was being said, and the storyline was very predictable."
4,A GREAT COMING OF AGE NOVEL,This was a wonderful read. Made me cry! If you like FRIED GREEN TOMATOES you will like this. About a girl who runs away from home only to find the same place her mother ran away to long ago. A lovely book!!! READ IT WITH YOUR TEENAGE DAUGHTER TO SPARK WONDERFUL CONVERSATIONS.
5,A Memorable Read,"I read this book months ago, yet the images still play in my mind. In particular, a gun in a child's hands, the wailing wall, the political/racial tension of the 1960's, the Black Madonna. Reading it again, Sue Monk Kidd's characters remain true and their stories compelling. I hear echoes of Scout (To Kill a Mockingbird) in Lily, both deftly portrayed young southern girls coming of age. Truly a wonderful book!"
2,A Lifetime original movie?,"This book is one of the most cliche-ridden books I've ever read. The coming-of-age teen girl. The african-american wisdom. The abusive Southern father. New-age take on old religions. Hugs. Crying. Funerals and weddings. All in a Southern summer.Other books have taken these cliches and done great things. That's what made them cliches. Our author, however, has given us a book so unoriginal, so cloyingly sweet, as to dull the palate and the senses. If you need some heart-warming fluff, and can hold your breath long enough, by all means, read this book. Otherwise, read anything else.Also, the author was undoubtedly writing the screenplay at the same time she was writing this book. I'm sure the movie rights are signed and sealed by now. And Oprah will play the part of August, a role she was born for. Yes, it's one of those kinds of books."
5,Great Book for girls/women of all ages,"Excellent read. Makes you wish the book would go on and on. Growing up in the south, I have seen and experienced many of the addages that are written in this wonderful book. The author leaves you wishing you actually were part of the family and came to visit every Sunday! The characters in this book are wonderful, beautiful and most of all loving to a girl that has lacked this most of her life. I will forever see bees and honey in a different light!"
1,"don't read this book, please","Wants to be ""The Color Purple"" but misses in every way. Characters drawn in chalk on tissue paper, messy and unclear. Story, what story? Forgettable, trite, so uninteresting it left no shadow in my memory."
1,High Class Kitsch,"I had to read this book for my book club, and can not figure out for the life of me, why this book would be a NY Times Bestseller. I found the story to be contrived, and the characters to be unbelievable and flat. Frankly, I felt like Kidd was insulting my intelligence by 1)suggesting I would actually buy her characters, and 2)her constant forcefeeding of all explanation of symbolism she employs throughout the book (""Okay, Okay I get it!!! Lily is the name of the flower presented to the Virgin Mary. She's taken in by a Hive of black women, including a mother figure, the Black Madonna!"").The Secret Life of Bees relies primarily on cliches to tell the story of a 14 year old Southern Girl growing up in the 1960's. My idea of a good book is one that teaches me to think differently about the world. Kidd does try to do that, but lacks the originality to succeed. The end result is this innocuous story that feels like a made for television movie."
4,A nice fairy tale to warm your heart,"This book was like a fairy tale, simple yet compelling. I couldn't really put it down when I started. I'll agree that the story is in many ways ""superficial"", most of the characters had predictable behaviors from beginning to end of book, and some parts of the story seems silly. But if you approach this book as a fairy tale and not as a bit of historical fiction then you'd definitely enjoy it more. To me this story is really about how simple love is despite all its apparent complexities. I highly recommend it if you are looking for something life-affirming without too much baggage."
2,Nothing extraordinary,"This was a good book, however there are many good books out there. There wasn't anything about this particular book that made it stand out from any other feel good story. In some places the wording was very lyrical and ejoyable to read.However the story itself is nothing original: Setting-The South. Main Character-Young white girl with an abusive parent(s) Plot-She manages to stumble upon the one person who seems to care about her. Most likely this person is a) a woman and b) black. Or in this case it is several women.If you were really into this sort of story I would suggest reading ""Before Women had Wings"", or ""Ellen Foster"". Kidd's book basically follows the plotline of these two books, and I think these are a little bit better than this one."
2,Predictable Life of Bees,"This book reads like a typical novel set in the American South during the 1960s. Southern white girl has problems, runs to the shelter of kind black woman, finds inner peace and meaning to life in the sanctuary of the bee-world and the very odd religious practices of this woman. Admittedly the section that talks about the garden is somewhat enchanting. However, the rest of the book is predictable, and in my opinion, ho-hum. If you don't have much else to do you may want to pick up a copy. Otherwise, move on my friend, move on."
3,interesting title...,"I remebered Where The Heart Is reading this book, because it has the same lucky feeling all around, a little girl in a miserable situation trying to find love, the truth and the meaning of life. It is a page turner, you also feel that you know what is going to happen next, but you wait till you read it.Reading the first part of the book about Lily growing up and her current situation, I anticipated that the story would be more mysterious and more challenging, but then it became very predictable and I lost interest, I kept reading to confirm my speculations. I loved the connectivity between humans and bees, and I thought the same mystery and magic would revolve around Lily's story, I was a little disappointed!Love has no boundries, every human being is important and vital to the greater scheme of life."
3,that was ok,"I kind of agree with the people below me. Some of the things that happened in the book weren't believeable. But if you don't really have anything else to read, and you are extremely insomnic of whatever the advective is for that, it will be an OK book.It won't be one of those books to stay with you for the rest of your life, though."
4,Bees,What an interesting little book. Good story. Unusual setting but very well written. You watched a little girl grow up. I hope a sequel will be in the works.
5,A TOUCHING STORYABOUT A GIRL IN SEARCH OF FAMILY LOVE,"WOW! This is a story about a girl in the 1960's, during the Civil Rights Act. I could not put this book down! Kidd has done an excellent job on this fantastic novel, and I plan to read more of her's. I would reccommend this to anyone from 13, to above and beyond!Lily Owens has run away from home. Reason? She has just broken her black nanny out of jail, she has an abusive father, and is in search of the history of her dead mother's past. She ends up on a bee-raising ""farm,"" with three black old maids. Secrets of her Mother are revealed as she stays with these ladies, and parts in her she discovers along the way.I loved this book sooo much! I would put it at the top of the New York Bestseller's list in no time if I were the judge!! READ THIS BOOK!"
4,The Simplicity of Love,I agree with some previous reviewers: the most redeeming part of this novel was its life affirming message about the simplicity of love. Reminds me very much of Kirk Martin's books The Gravel Drive and Shade of the Maple. I enjoyed these author's style of writing and positive messages. Highly recommended.
4,A true chick flick book,I thoroughly enjoyed all of the characters in this book. They are an incredible group of women whose spirit and spirituality shines through in different ways in each of them. They truly understand the meaning of giving of yourself for the betterment of a young girl.
4,The Secret Life of The Bees Book Review,"Can you imagine leaving your home and everything you've ever known to find information about your mothers past? Lily Owens is a teenage girl living in South Carolina in 1964 who goes on a journey to find information about her dead mother along with her housekeeper Rosaleen and to escape her abusive father. Along the way she meets three sisters who take her in and show her their beekeeping ways. Will Lily find meet anyone that knew her mom, will T-Ray, her abusive father find her, or will she end up living with the beekeeping sisters forever?I love the way the author, Sue Monk Kidd always brought old characters back into the story. She also incorporated actual issues happening dur ing those times like racism and segregation.I recommend this book to boys and girls or anyone who enjoys solving mysteries."
4,The Secret Life of Bees,The book was received in a very timely manner and is in very good condition. I am completely satisfied.
3,Book,"The book was good, but since I asked for it to be ""new"" and it was obviously used (though not in bad shape or anything), it was a little disappointing. It did arrive quickly."
2,The Secret Life of Boring,This book had a very bad ending to it. The author should have had a different outcome. Would not advise anyone to waste their time on this book.
3,buzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz,"could have had better chaceter delvp. But all in all, a good story. Not a page turner, She really let the rednecks off easy. and living in the south in the 60's, white folks would never have let that child stay with them and considering the climate when this was written, they would have had to keep her hidden to keep her there. So not super believible, but it was a decent feel good story."
1,Hooray for magical Negroes!,"Where on earth do I start? Where? This book is so patronizing and awful that it would be funny if it wasn't so successful. In the author's world, black people are not actual people; they're just accessories to help good white folks find their way. And BOY, do black people looooove white people in Kidd's world! They don't seem to be concerned with their own safety - be it antagonizing three white men or riding around town with a young, white woman or enrolling a white child in school (how DID they pull that off, anyway?) - nor do they seem to have any family or friends. If you're white and you think Dr. King ended racism, you'll love this book. If your head isn't shoved completely up your rear end, you'll see it for what it is."
1,Such a Disappointment,"I was so looking forward to reading this book after all of the rave reviews it received. However, as I was reading it, I actually thought that perhaps I had a different version of the book than everyone else had read. The language was very simplistic as were the characters in the book. There was no process leading you to believe any of the characters or feel for them. If you have read this book and don't like it, don't worry- you have company."
3,Pleasant,"I love the main character, the description, and it certainly taught me a lot. It was a long read though"
5,It's no secret...I love this book!,"14 year old Lily Owens runs away from home with her Black nanny, Rosaleen, stands up for her right to vote. The story is set in the South in the early sixties. Rosaleen is the only mother Lily has, since her real mother died when Lily was four. The two run away to Tiburon, South Carolina on the hunch that Lily's mother, who had written the city name on the back of a photo of the Black Madonna, had once lived there. After arriving in Tiburon, Lily spots the Black Madonna on a jar of honey in a store. Lily goes to the beekeeper's house and is taken in by a family of three Black sisters. Lily becomes an apprentice beekeeper under the guidance of August, the head of the household. The story not only has a pro-female storyline, but contains the background story of the Black Madonna, a symbol of the sacred feminine in Europe."
5,Superb story telling!,"Sue Monk Kidd has developed a cast of characters that invite you in. You become one with them and feel each of them intimatley. You get to know Lily the 14 year old struggling with the abuse of her father and the death of her mother, looking for some type of emotional relief.You are then are introduced to three beekeeping sisters who make you realize the beauty within yourself and within living. Truly an amazing novel that needs to be read!"
3,a pretty good read,"The book is more aimed at someone between the ages of 12-16, particularly female. Kidd portrays well the frailty of this girl, coupled with her insecurities and joys. Her relationships to the people around her are those I find unreal a little bit- saintly people who are completely forgiving. although the main character is real enough, the people around her settings seem fake, enough so that it makes it hard to relate. your call people!"
2,So So,I wouldn't recommend. Mother in Law raved about this book & even borrowed it to me. I just kept waiting for something to happen & it never did. Just to slow paced for me.
4,Excellent Read,"I'm not a fan of books that have an overpowering hook. This one does and it works, even though it drags on the storyline from time to time. I'm talking about the bees. Read past them and you will be transported into the world of a teenage girl caught in the turmoil of both her dysfunctional life and the coming of age of the civil rights' movement. It is masterfully told and written simply, effortlessly. It's story telling at it's finest. Lilly is the main character yet she is not the most important character. She's just the thread that holds the story together. The supporting cast of ladies (who Are the story), her mother, the town folks, the cops, the bullies and bigots, and the dad combine to form a memorable story told artfully. You should read it."
4,Excellent Read,"This was a wonderfully crafted book. We read it as part of our women's book club and had a wonderful discussion. The questions in the back fueled many more questions. Although I found the plot a little bit easy, it was enjoyed by a wide variety of women from different backgrounds. I would recommend this book for any women's group."
5,Beautifully written and well-told,I found this book to be perfectly wonderful. It is a delightful story about making a home in unlikely places and the ability for a heart to see past the obvious and socially-described to find love and affection. It is a very sweet story and touches on the possibilities for when we let our guards down and release our stereotypes.
3,A melancholy quest,"This novel is about a girl's need and quest for her mother, who passed away when she was merely a child.The narrative is humorous, light and expressive; characters are wonderfully developed and leave comprehensive impressions despite the fact that this is a relatively short book.As some of the reviews point out, the ending, to some degree does leave the reader wondering... as there is a conflict between the impressions left by style of writing and the culmination of the story itself.While the ending is penned beautifully, the story leaves a feeling of incompleteness hanging over the reader's head.The strength of the book lies in that of its characters as even the supporting characters leave a very very strong impression on the reader. Personally, I felt touched by May more than anyone else.Overall, a nice book and worth adding to one's collection."
4,"Engaging Novel, Sometimes Lacking in Originality","This novel asks the reader to suspend disbelief in a series of remarkable events in the South. I, for one, was able to believe the events because of the writer's clearly articulated characters, descriptive setting and clever plot. Because the novel deals with the coming of age of a girl and her sense of self and place, I, as a man, did not think I could relate to the story. Nevertheless, for the most part, I was pleasantly surprised that the issue of gender did not hinder my enjoyment of the novel. Part of the reason for this is that Ms. Kidd writes in the secure and historic tradition of the Southern grotesque, in the manner of Eudora Welty, Carson McCullers and especially, Flannery O'Connor. However, that is also why this novel suffers at times; it owes a lot to these writers and is therefore sometimes derivative. I look forward to Ms. Kidd finding her own voice in future works."
5,One of my favorites,"I loved this book. I had no idea what to expect, so I was pleasantly surprised with the turn of every page. Wonderfully written, a story that touches the heart."
5,Devine Feminine Spirit,This book was an amazing journey that you hate to see end. Highly recommended for anyone needing to reconnect with the female spirit!
4,The secret life of bees,Not finished yet but so far so good :-)A lot of good philosophy stuff in there :-)Good theme such as white/black issues.Old/ youngMale/ femaleLoveEtc..
1,So Many Wrongs,"I hated this book, but couldn't figure out why so I kept reading. I realized it's one of those books that you can stare at for hours and never fall asleep. There was no drama, no high and low in the events; it's just flat.I finally read some of the other reviews and realized how right they are. In the real world, the police would have pulled a white girl out of a black house kicking and screaming, and found a white family for her to stay with.Did I misread, or did the main road end just after leaving the highway? You'd think a town that could supply so many bananas would at least have Main Street paved."
1,syrupy and unreal,"sort of interesting in the beginning, but then the characters got too ridiculous and the whole statued-honey orgy was way too much."
5,Bee-u-tiful book!,"I could not put it down!n Lily, Rosaleen, and the Calendar sisters create a rich and unique relationship, removing barriers of place, time, race, or reason. Collectively, my book club loved this book and we could not stop talking about the events that unfolded, the comraderie that was developed for the young Lily, and the basic human tenets that bond all women; joy, sorrow, love and kindness!"
5,What a great book!!,"Ms. Kidd is definately a true story-teller. There is nothing I can say negative about this book, except that it ended too fast for me. :-)"
3,The Secret Life of Bees Review,"I really enjoyed the book, The Secret Life of Bees, by Sue Monk Kidd. The book was a really easy read but still profound. The book is about a girl, Lily Owens, that lives in the south during the times of racial discrimination. ""The bees came the summer of 1964, the summer I turned fourteen and my life went spinning off into a whole new orbital, and I mean a whole new orbital"" (Kidd 1-2). Her life is empty because of the mystery of her mother's death. ""My first and only memory of my mother was the day she died"" (Kidd 5). Throughout the book Lily tries to clear her head by seeking the truth wherever it may lead her. The book is humorous, poignant, and even romantic. The book is geared towards a female audience. Women of all ages will enjoy the book and share it with the next generation."
5,"Now, THIS is a good book!","This is my all time favorite fiction book. I was sad when it ended. So, I bought the book on CD and listened to it.14-year-old, caucasian Lily discovers who she is and what happened to her now-dead mother. She embarks on a journey with her black housekeeper that takes her to a nearby town and into the home of three black sisters who raised bees.Their cultures are quite different but their basic needs and desire for love are universal.I recommend this book highly."
2,Begging to be an Oprah Pick,"The story was not particularly unique or interesting, ditto the characters. Some of the stylistic components were good, and I really liked the quotations from bee books that headed each chapter. The quotes were thematically relevant and lovely on their own as well.Mostly I thought there was no ""there, there."" Blah blah blah, white girl and black nanny run away from unpleasant circumstances during times of racial unrest in the South. Their adventures while on the lamb were not interesting. The little attempts at making secondary characters have dimension by virtue of their quirkiness was a flop, if you ask me.It wasn't horrible, but it just wasn't worthwhile either. I can't imagine what people are accustomed to, that they're giving this thing four or five stars."
2,It took me three tries to get through this book,"This book was not at all what I expected. After hearing glowing reviews I expected not to be able to put it down. Once I started reading it I encountered several people in the subway and in Central Park (some who approached me after seeing me reading it and vice versa) who seemed to have the same trouble getting through it that I did. Two said they finally gave up. I am never one to quit on a book so I did manage to get through it.It started really well and i was instantly drawn into the characters. They were very well written and developed. But once they end up with the ladies making honey I just couldn't keep interested. The story with her mother was, in my opinion, anticlimactic. But I do have to say that I didn't expect the outcome with her father. Maybe all the good reviews set my expectations too high...but this book just didn't do it for me."
1,Glad I did not pay for this book,"I am glad I did not pay the price on Amazon for this book. I checked this book out at the library. I lived in the South in the 50s, 60s and 70s. (and still do) I almost didn't finish the book but it was for a book club review. I am sorry I spent my time and enegery on something like this when there are so many good books out there to read. I can't believe anyone would worship a piece of wood."
2,Disappointed,"I bought this book after the movie came out, without having seen the movie, because of all the positive reviews I heard. I rarely read a book that I don't like, but I had problems with the way The Secret Life of Bees was written. It had an inauthentic vibe to it, like it was obviously written by someone who didn't live during that time. I frequently read and love books dealing with racial issues during the same time period, from white and black perspectives, but this story was simply a story, and didn't take me beyond the pages."
1,Disappointing,"I'm still trying to figure out what all the rave is about. This book was a huge disappointment. It started out with potential, and then fizzled around discovery of the ""pink house"". It was the same mumbo over and over again. Also, the author should have done more research on African American lives in the 1960s, particularly in the South, and paid close attention to their religious views. I can see a cult-like religion amoung a group of women in Louisiana, but South Carolina--hardly! And Lily discusses all the racial tension and unrest that is happening in the town, yet she is always in a truck with Zach (a black teenager, with a very dark complexion), and no one notices this or says anything about it--what! I think had the story been written in a narrative voice, it would have been a lot better. The other characters would have been a lot stronger and it would have given more to the story. As it is, I wouldn't recommend it to anyone, and I definately don't want to see the movie."
5,The AUDIOBOOK is simply THE BEST!,"Jenna Lamia's reading of this book is superb, to put it mildly. If I had to be stranded on a desert island and there was a cd player and one audio book there to keep me company, I would hope against hope that this beautifully narrated audio cd was it. I fell in love with Lily and wanted to adopt her. Heck, I fell in love with ALL the women in this book and wanted to go and live in the pink house. I have since purchased two additional audio cd's for friends, because this is a once-in-a-lifetime treat for the soul and deserves to be shared with those I hold dearly in my heart. I STILL think about this book, though I finished listening to the audio cd two months ago. It wormed its way into the recesses of my spirituality and left its mark forever and made me a better person for it. Do something really nice for yourself: buy the audio cd. Because you deserve it!"
2,Disappointing,"My English teacher offered to let me borrow her copy of this book after an exam. I graciously accepted and found myself enjoying the philosophy of the book and the descriptions. I was also intrigued by the mystery that seemed ready to unfold.The ""mystery,"" when revealed, was incredibly disappointing and anti-climactic. I read through the boring events hoping that at some point it would get good. It didn't. This book seems like it was written for middle school girls who are still innocent enough to want this book to apply to them. It is not a book for adults.The book is filled with heartwarming messages. If you don't like that, you won't like this book."
2,Don't get all the hype,"I am sorry, this book was totally disappointing...can't actually say too much good about it. Usually I agree with this many reviews....all I can say is reading it was a waste of time."
2,Only if your bored...,"... and want some mindless reading. Not what I had hoped or expected based on all the talk. Not a BAD book, per se, just nothing much to it. I don't know what I was expecting, but whatever it was, it wasn't there."
2,overly metaphorical,"I don't know if I am alone on this as I didn't read all 1,000+ reviews, but I thought Sue Monk Kidd was trying way too hard...I get it, you are good with prose, but please don't cram it down my throat. It was ""pretty"" to the point of annoyance and it made me sympathize less with Lily in the end....overall, I'd say this book is overrated."
5,Me like honey,"This book sucked me in like only a good novel can. Not only did I turn the pages as fast as my eyes would let me, but I found myself drawn to a container of whipped honey in my pantry. Read and enjoy."
2,Don't have to take my words,"I think this book should only be read by women because there are many things here that men most probably might find boring and not interesting. I finished the book because I was hoping that I might like it somewhere before the last chapter, but boy.. I was disappointed. Well, don't take my words for it, read it and see you might like it. After all, different folks like things differently.Maybe I'll try to find a book about the secret life of cockroach. I might like it better that this book."
3,The Secret life of Bees!!!!,"The Secret Life of Bees, written by Sue Monk Kidd, was a great novel. It is about a young girl, Lily, who lived with ehr abusive father and motherly figure, Rosaleen, on a peach famr in South Carolina, where Lily is haunted by her mothers violent death. When Rosaleen insults 3 other the raciset men int town, Lily decides to runaway with her to Tiburon, S.C., a town she saw on the back of a picture her mother had.They stayed with three honey-making, bee-keeping sisters, where they shared many difficulties and learned many values.Lily becomes stronger and can find the ""mother inside of her"" and to reconecct with this, whoch she has longed for all her life."
4,I cared about the characters in this book,"I read this book in two sittings, it was very enjoyable and fast paced. I cared about the characters and have only the best feelings about all of the women in the book. Even though the end wasn't exactly happy go lucky per se, it left me with a feeling of contentment. I have a strong hope that the ""Calendar Sisters"" and all of the other women (including Lily)in this story will get their happily ever after.Read the full review at <...>"
4,Worth reading,"Set during the civil rights era,The Secret Life of Beesis a coming-of-age story about a young girl as she stuggles to make sense of her past, her present and the changing world around her. Though racial issues form a backdrop to the story and do trigger some events, this is not the main theme of this novel. Rather this book is about journeys - physical journeys, emotional journeys and the journey of understanding that happens to us all as we grow up. I highly recommend this book for adults and young adults alike."
2,"Shouldn't this be in the ""young adults"" section???","It was cute, I'll give it that. And being a true southerner, I did enjoy some of the cultural references, but I have a really hard time believing this book was written for an adult audience. I think it would really appeal to a girl the same age as (or a little younger than) the first-person narrator, a girl of 15. But as a thirty-something-year-old woman, it left me intellectually and emotionally hungry. The style of writing is pleasant (reminiscent of The Heart is a Lonely Hunter) but the content is lacking. The ideas are there, but the execution is too juvenile to make it believable. If you're old enough to drive, skip the book and just see the movie and save yourself several hours. I wish I had."
4,Sweet But Dark,"Sue Monk Kidd's 14-year-old principal character Lily Owens' quest to unlock the mystery of her deceased mother's past leads her to forge a familial bond with an unlikely family of accomplished black women. The story is bittersweet in that unimaginable cruelties are inflicted upon the young girl by her bitter and emotionally battered father ""Bees"" is set in the early era of the Civil Right movement. Kidd includes just enough racial tension to make the story believable. General lessons in humanity are poetic as Kidd employs the goings and doings in the complex lives of ""simple honey bees."""
3,"Beautiful, rich writing, just not that engrossing","I really appreciated the dripping imagery and detail in this book. However the story didn't captivate me. I enjoyed it, but when it was over, it was just over."
2,Expected More,"This book was okay, but it's NOT great writing as the reviews on the first few pages suggest -- it is, very simply, brain candy. Take it to the beach. If you want a Southern, teenage voice in a work that is truly LITERATURE, read Sheri Joseph's ""Bear Me Safely Over"" or Heather Sellers' ""Georgia Under Water."" It's a shame this book has gotten the readership it has, really, when there are so many better, more complex books out there on the same subject."
3,good stuff but overrated,"The Secret Life of Bees is a terrific 220-page novel. Unfortunately, it's 300 pages long. How many epiphanies,how many symbols, how many analyses of the protagonist's feelings, how many aphoristic words of wisdom should one novel provide? Bees indulges in way too many of all these things. The novel is more than readable and contains some lovely writing and genuine humor, much of it provided by characters who are memorable as individuals and as members of groups (the sisters, the Daughters of Mary, etc.). However, its big secret is fairly clear quite early on, and the big revelations, when Lily and August finally, mercifully get around to them, don't pay off nearly as well for the reader as they do for the characters. There is much good in The Secret Life of Bees, but Ms. Kidd needs to tighten her work, or submit it to a more hard-nosed editor."
2,"This ""Secret"" should be kept -- on the shelf","For much of ""Secret Life of Bees,"" Sue Monk Kidd manages to stay just short of the sugary, politically correct, ""women's inspirational"" fiction that has gummed up the bestseller list in recent years. Lily and Rosaleen have some spunk and their adventures at first stay within the realm of the believable. But once the pair land in Tiburon, things start getting sticky-sweet. All kinds of ""life-affirming"" preachifying starts flowing from the characters' lips, and the novel devolves into a hybrid of Alice Walker and Anne Lamott, without Walker's writing skill or Lamott's passion. The only thing that kept me reading toward the end was the hope that some of the characters would get stung."
2,Disappointed.,"Chosen as one of my book group reads, this is a quick and light read. I was surprised to find the novel so lacking in depth and full of cliches after having read so many good reviews of it. If a Southern novel is what you're looking for there are many much more worthy of your time: Anything by Eudora Welty and Carson McCullers and of course To Kill A Mockingbird. This book is a total lightweight compared to any of those and just not as interesting."
4,GREAT!,"I gave this book 4 stars because the first half is pretty slow and the writing leaves something to be desired. But I am sooooo glad I perservered - the second half of this book is a treasure trove of insights, great similes and metaphors, and fantastic writing. I finished this book last night, and today I am planning on going through the second half and underlining all the great passages that I never want to forget."
4,a honey of a bee book..........,"Very good read, believable, enjoyable, good characterization, and lovely details. I learned alot about bees and wise women."
2,Interesting but lacks some development,"Sue Monk Kidd creates a world for Lily that is soft and likeable. However, it seems like some of the characters lack life or a successful outline. T Ray is passionless and seems to fizzle out due to his flat history that we never get to discover. The three calendar sisters appear to be several sides of one full woman. They bleed together without enough qualities to separate them. Also, I find it hard to believe that Lily's first romance would not cause any turmoil.The entire story seems to go buy in haze that matches the pink colored house. The plot screams to be developed into a full fledged journey. Instead, it is shortchanged for a shorter tale that lacks a complete climax and full characters. I wished Monk Kidd had taken this to the drawing board one more time."
3,Not impressed,"I read the rave reviews of this book and thought that it was going to be awsome...it fell somewhat short. Besides most of the book not being terribly well written and unrealistic it was highly predictable. I would reccommend the book to pre-teen females, but for everyone else, take your money elsewhere :)"
2,Ugh... Enough with the stupid honey!,"I was interested in Rosaleen and Lily's story, and the missing mom... but at the end I kind of wanted my 2 nights of reading back. I am all for a good metaphor, but it became WAY too tedious. I eventually found myself skimming through a lot of the religious/folk stuff regarding the statue and the group of honey worshippers. When the author talked about the calender girls waxing the statue with honey all I could think was... gross? sticky? It just seemed like they were taking the bee thing waaaaay too far.I wasn't satisfied how things ended up in a nice, neat little bow too. Lily's dad spent years making her life miserable and was livid at her dissapearance, but in the span of one conversation that was all reversed and ""OK, Lily, you can live with the nice strange ladies that I've never met, as long as it makes you happy."" It was all just too far-fetched and self-serving."
3,Doesn't live up to the hype.,"Often I find that critically acclaimed books just don't cut the mustard for me; usually they're dull, dull, dull. (Critics - who ARE these people? Don't get me started.) This is just another case in point. For all its critical acclaim, this book was disappointing. The overall idea wasn't bad, if you can suspend your disbelief about the incredible coincidence that the heroine, in need of help, finds the same family that her mother found a generation earlier; a premise upon which the entire tale hangs. But the intertwined theme of corrupted Mariolatry throughout pretty much ruined the enjoyment, for me, of what should have been a stronger story. That being said, the group of strong women coming together to help one another was the sole redeeming feature of this book. Unfortunately, it wasn't enough."
4,A Story Most Of Us Can Relate To,"While we may not all have suffered the troubles that Lily has, as girls most of us felt insecurities of some sort - were we loved, did we do the right things, what did the people around us think of us, what would our lives be like when we grew up??? This is a compelling story of a young girl, growing up in the South during times of great civil unrest and the tragedy she suffered from losing her mother and her journey to discover both who she is and who her mother was. As Lily's story unfolds and she travels the road to self-discovers the reader is drawn in by both sympathy to and fascination of Lily's situation and what the outcome will be. This was a good read that left me with a warm feeling when I was finished."
1,In the Minority,"As a voice for the minority, may I say that I did not care for this book. The story seemed contrived and self-consciously Toni Morrison-ish. In addition, the strange theology of the ""sisterhood of man and motherhood of Mary"" was simply asinine to me."
2,Don't waste your time!,"I have to agree with the reviewer from South Carolina who wrote the ""Enraging!"" review. This book is really not worth the time (or money!). It was overdramatic and sappy, with way too much emotion built up over small things. It was hard to imagine the narrator as a 14-year-old girl with the sorts of things she was supposedly thinking, and the plot had several inconsistencies and various things that could have been more developed. It ended up being really predictable, much like the typical Lifetime movie stories. I guess I should have read the description on the back more carefull, because I missed this originally: ""a story that women will share and pass on to their daughters for years to come."" Just because a book's author and/or editor tell you their book is going to have such an impact doesn't mean it will!"
2,"Amen, Cecelia Connelly of Ohio!","I agree with Cecelia. The book, although well written, especially when the author dissects Lily's state of mind, is heavy, heavy, heavy like Rosaleen (the best character IMHO, as August and her sisters are not real or believable, like they're bees in human form). It is also a sad, sad, sad paean on abandonment, and at a certain point you feel that the atmosphere is so heavy, suffocating and gloomy that you can't wait for it to be finished. Many concepts and descriptions are repetitive and somnolent like the South.Maybe reaching this heavy, thick gloominess (the comparison with honey is inevitable) was the author's intent, and if so, the book is a masterpiece. But after I finished reading it, I felt like reaching for air."
5,A book I will give to my women friends...,"This is a lovely book. I don't give that praise easily...and by giving it, I mean that the novel is well crafted with expressive prose and finely drawn characters. It has a depth of meaning not only in its action, but in the allegorical depth suggested through the imagery which forms an intricate substructure. ""The secret life"" speaks of motherhood, womanhood, love, discovery, and personal strength. It provides wisdom to women, and pride, and beauty. And, it's a compelling story. I will give it as a gift to the people I care about."
3,Disappointing,"After hearing so much positive buzz about this book, I was somewhat disappointed. I found it somewhat silly and predictable. I gave it three stars only because it did keep me mildly entertained and helped pass some time waiting in my doctor's office."
1,disappointing,"i might have given this book three stars had it not been recommended by one of the panelists on ""topicA with tina brown"" whom i respected a little too much which led me to believe that this book would rival some of the other books in my ""best book i've ever read"" category. although this book had many ""moments"", i was mostly disappointed and finally gave up on it completely after discovering that May's twin sister had been named April [along with other such contrivances]. i so much wanted to like this book; however, after struggling through more than half of it, i realized that this was not to be."
3,can't add a star,"Enjoyed it...but...have read much better. Can't add to the accolades or agree as I found it sometimes predictable and sorta florid.There were things to like, though. Bottom line is I finished it and wouldn't for a less than three star book."
3,belongs on teenagers' reading list,I received twice my daily ration of cliches and incredulous moments before I'd read one-third of the book...skimmed the rest and wasn't surprised by the hackneyed ending. Kidd's lovely descriptive prose was appreciated but not strong enough to give substance to this froth.
2,Lifetime Original Movie - blah!,"Like a Lifetime Original movie, I thought this book was missing something. I started out interested but started skipping paragraphs mid-way through becasue they didn't hold my interest. I had a hard time liking or disliking any the characters and I thought the author tried to introduce too many possible plots but never followed through on any of them. The characters wer mildly interesting but in the end, diappointing. Read Life of Pi - I thought it had one of the best endings I've ever read and I loved all of the characters."
4,"Great, endearing novel.","This is a great story of a blossoming girl from South Carolina. Her heart wrenching secrets and head full of dreams allows the reader to feel truly connected to her character, her struggles, and her triumphs."
3,Quick read,"I very much enjoyed reading this book, it took a few hours on a rainy Sunday, and I do not consider those hours wasted. My only disappointment comes from the lack of character development. As much as we learned about Lily and the other ladies, I wish a bit more had been invested into their growth. 50 more pages and the book would have been perfect."
5,Secret Life of Bees,This book came to me in outstanding shape. It was so good I would have thought it was brand new!
3,Summer reading,My son had to read this for school. Summer reading it he said it was okay. But he would not recommend.
5,An Excellent Read!,"I found this book to be well written, not at all the obvious work of a beginning writer, as some reviewers have intimated. It flowed well, and there were just enough characters to make it interesting. Thnak you, Sue Monk Kidd, for an enjoyable novel!"
5,The Secret Life of Bees,This is a good book and I read it because I was inspired by the movie. I received the book in record time and at a very good price with the cover on it of the movie's trailer. The movie is pretty much true to the book and I was not disappointed at reading it. A very enjoyable read!
4,The Book Always Beats the Movie,"This was a terrific book, but if you haven't seen the movie yet - don't bother, because it pales in comparison to the book! The Movie [of the same title] was a 2010 hit starring Queen Latifa, Dekota Fanning, Americal Idol winner Jennifer Hudson, R&B singer Alecia Keys, and last but not least, the underrated [but fabulous] actress Spohia Okanube. This is an excellant story to watch with your teen - no explicit scenes at all, and the racial tension is very minimal."
5,"Sue Monk Kidd's ""The Secret Lives of Bees""","I bought this book because of a review I read and because I like Sue Monk Kidd, but it surpassed my expectations. She did such a great job of describing Lily Owens, her father, the desire for love from a mother who may have left her and how she found love in the most unusual way. Ms. Kidd touched so many aspects of hidden feelings in the various people. To use black people honoring Mary, the mother of Jesus, was also a real twist. I loved it and could hardly put the book down and have recommended it for my local book club to read."
2,Sorry :(,"well I am glad so many people enjoyed The Secret Life of Bees enough to give it 5 stars. Unfortunately for me, I got very bored with it and had to force myself to finish. It is a bit too cutesy for me at this point but I probably would have enjoyed it immensely when I was in middle school and would recommend it to girls of that age (11-14)."
2,not particularly impressive.,"After starting the book many times and putting it down, I have finally finished it and I wasn't impressed. The story should have grabbed me and to some extent it sort of did in the beginning. It had the makings of To Kill a Mockingbird or even Huck Finn.. But the comparison stops there, because while those books grab and keep you interest, this one does not. I found it difficult to get into the endless boring stories of the bees and of the Black Madonna. It really did seem to into some sort of fantasy land, as another reviewer said. The story does not seem to be completely consistant with the time period. How do the black women just get to keep this little white girl and no one has a problem with it in the 1960s? This book leaves a lot of questions unanswered."
2,disappointing,"I found Sue Monk Kidd's _Dance of the Dissident Daughter_ so profound and powerful, that I was surprised at the quality of this novel. The lessons learned by the heroine are clumsily stated and made so obvious that the reader finds no pleasure in discovery. For anyone familiar with _Dance of the Dissident Daughter_ (which *is* a five star book!), _The Secret Life of Bees_ will seem a graceless, fictional retelling of the same story. Kidd is at her best when speaking from her own perspective; hopefully she can grow as a novelist. The story itself is uplifting, but I would have preferred it as a movie: the awkward descriptions would be better handled as subtle visual images."
3,Not worth all the hype...,"My Mom and several of my friends thought that it was an amazing book, and that I should read it, but frankly I don't understand why it is getting so much attention. It was a good book but was definitely not the best book I've ever read."
4,"Not bad, not great","If 3.5 had been an available rating, that would have been my choice for this book. While it had interesting characters (especially the ""calendar"" sisters)and I learned a lot about beekeeping,it also was based on a very far-fetched premise, one that I could not manage to get a handle on.The premise that a black woman, sprung from jail by a 13 year old white girl, would run away with that child and take refuge someplace with no questions asked.....yikes, just plain unrealistic!I thought this author also tried to deal with too many ""issues"" : racism, romance, child neglect, feminism, religion, mysticism, and so on. It was just too much for one book and in places the book really dragged for me.These negatives were a shame because I think that the author has a beautiful grasp of language and the character development was very good. Like another reviewer, I would have liked to know more about the sisters and their pasts."
1,be forewarned,It's been done too many times to list. But if you like books with a1.13 year old girl2. first person narrator who's3. Southern and has an4. abusive father5. with a little de rigeur race and religion thrown inthis is your book.
1,Another white hero,"This book is an idyllic model of white/black America. I don't understand why it is rated so high. In parts of the book it was so unbelievable, for example when Rosaleen spat on the white men's shoes or when the young black men threw a can at the group of older white men. Who would do that in the deep south in such a tumultuous time?I also feel disturbed that the focal point of the story is this innocent, white heroine. It is unsettling to me how many stories of that time focus on the white person: The Cider House Rules, The Power of One, The Secret Life of Bees. The book was somewhat entertaining to read, but very unbelievable."
2,cheesy,"The best part of the book is learning about bees.A bit too much like watching the Titantic movie - which drove me nuts - if you like mainstream, you'll like this. I only finished reading it because my mother gave it to me."
1,Just How Hard DO African Americans Have to Work?,"I found this book to be repugnant on so many levels it's difficult for me to begin. Giving new meaning to the term ""magical Negro"" the book follows the misdadventures of a motherless white girl as she meanders through the deep south of the 60's. She is rescued from her personal history of a depressed mom and abusive dad by the most stereotypical African American women this side of Gone with the Wind.I guess cleaning houses, getting denied decent jobs and dealing with virulent racism isn't enough of a challenge for these women in Kidd's eyes. They get to work overtime to harbor a teenage white girl as she searches for her ""inner mother"".This book left me wishing that MY inner mother had spoken up soon enough to save me a wasted $12.95."
1,as slow as a wet week,"Sadly, I wasted my time reading this novel through to the bitter-sweet end. Why the author wasted 3/4 of the book letting us know absolutely nothing and drawing the thin storyline out as far as she did is anyone's guess. Aimed at the teenage market perhaps, but most young readers of today would expect more value for their time than is delivered by this book. I can enjoy a slow book if the telling of the story is poetic, so it shouldn't even get a star for that. The best character in the book is Rosaleen, who surprised me by not picking up our little protagonist and throwing her in the nearest river. To the author I yelled ""Get on with it!"", to Lily ""Get over it!"".And by the way, the name Deborah means bee."
5,"A Must Read for Mothers & Daughters, Dads and Sons Too","""...Bees"" tells the story of Lily Owen, age 14, living on a peach farm in the South when the Civil Rights Act is passed. Told in the first person, we quickly learn that her mother is dead and her father is...complicated. What I really loved is how poignantly and accurately Ms. Kidd captured the tortures of adolescence, of trying to fit in with one's peers, which is never easy and for Lily, nearly impossible. My favorite line is when Lily, describing high school, says ""I might as well have had a sign stapled to my back stating 'I AM NOT POPULAR AND NEVER WILL BE.' "" The book is divided between filling in the back story (why did the mother die? How?) and what happens after Lily leaves home. It is funny, sad, suspenseful. The writing is lucid and elegant. Truly one of the best books I've read in years."
4,Sweet,"Sue Monk Kidd's The Secret Life of Bees is a sweet story an engaging little read that doesn't quite make it to greatness. The novel concerns Lily Owen a young teenage girl in a Southern town in 1964. Her mother died years ago under circumstances Lily barely remembers and her father is somewhat lacking in empathetic parenting skills. Lily and her black babysitter, Rosaleen, escape from their small town in search of the truth behind Lily's mother's life. They wind up in Tiburon, South Carolina, living with three black sisters who keep bees where Lily ultimately learns the truth about her mother. The novel is reminiscent, somewhat, of To Kill a Mockingbird, The Divine Secrets of the Ya Ya Sisterhood, among others. There are no surprises here, nothing that makes it stand out. Still it is a pleasurable gentle read that I think most will enjoy."
3,Sometimes honey is just too much...,"Sometimes honey is too sticky, too sweet and just too much -- like this story. Although I enjoyed the book and Kidd's writing style (especially about the bees and honey), the story itself was completely unbelievable. The worshipping of Black Mary's statue was a bit off-putting to me but I could handle it until they started rapturously bathing it in honey as worship -- I've avoided trying to figure out the symbolism of that episode.Despite the criticism, I really did enjoy the book and felt as though I knew and liked the characters. In fact, I think the book may have been better if it had been twice as long -- more background information about characters like Roselee and T Ray, more time for characters to develop their relationships together, realistic ways for them to come together, explanations for overcoming some obvious obstacles that were ignored, etc."
2,It's entertaining...,"...but sort of mind numbing after a while. It's like reading a Lifetime movie. The story's a little contrived, you know what you're reading could never actually happen, the characters are all a little too picture perfect, and the drama is laid thickly. As long as that's all you expect, you'll enjoy this book."
4,Nice lite read,"This story is a great one. It speak to many different aspects of our lives and culture. I loved the story. My twelve year read it and love it as well.You won't be dissapointed! Give ""The Secert Life of Bees"" a shot!"
5,A wonderful book.,"I strongly recommend this book to anyone. It is a beautifully written story with touching characters and about different issues that should be reflected on. I cried, I smiled. It is one of the best books I have read so far."
5,Secret,Secret Life of Bees is a wonderful story. It was my daughter's summer reading book and we purchased the book used. We received the book in excellent condition. Great experience.
5,What a wonderful story!!!,"I am from the deep piney woods of East Texas, I also am white. I have known and do know people black and white just like the ones in this story. The fact of the matter is that black people were treated like this (which was wrong) and some of thim did live just as is portrayed in the book. I felt like I was sitting in the parlor with the Daughters and their hats wanting to be a part of that friendship. I have to admit that I was a little troubled about how Mary had replaced our savior Jesus Christ but over all I loved the book."
2,The Secret Life of Bees,"This book is an idyllic model of white/black America. I don't understand why it is rated so high. Some parts of the book were so unbelievable, like when Rosaleen spat on the white men's shoes or when the young black men threw a can at the group of older white men. Who would do that in the deep south in such an unsettling time? I also feel disturbed that the focal point of the story is this innocent, white heroine. It is unsettling to me how many stories of that time focus on the white person: The Cider House Rules, The Power of One, The Secret Life of Bees. The book was somewhat entertaining to read, but very unbelievable."
1,cookie cutter novel,"I live near Spartanburg, SC. The language phrasings of the characters used in book is accurate enough for the era(60's) and region of the country. That's about it though, the first half of the book admittedly had me hooked. It reminded me of the fast read of ""to kill a mocking bird"". But that is where it stops. The plot of the story is tired. The references to bees /christian connations are strewn throughout. The poor white girl who runs away from the bad man to be saved by a ""hive"" of women who swoop her up and protect her while she escapes her old life. You know how it goes,She learns to stand up for herself in the end and make her own decisions. Blah Blah. The book is not original idea and reeks of sentimentality."
2,This book is overrated,"I bought this book to read on the airplane. It's light and entertaining but I expected more given all the talk about it. I was surprised at how one dimensional the characters were, particularly the black women who live to nurture white children. The bee theme was initially interesting but only served to delay the realization that this was a boring story."
2,Disappointing,"I agree with some of the other reviews: this book was a let-down. I kept waiting for the story to improve, but it never did. I don't understand why this book is on best seller lists; there are far better titles out there to spend one's time reading."
2,"Too sweet, too corny, not enough real life","Meh. So so. Really sappy, venturing into the unbelievable. Hard to care about such characters. The supporting characters are undifferentiated; most of the black women sound exactly like each other: super wise and caring. The redemption is too much and I struggled with the last sixty pages. The setting is generic. Nothing felt authentic. Passable women's fiction in the style of RWA but nothing coming close to a great southern writer. I wanted more but it seemed like nothing really happened. Some of the descriptive language is pretty and different, but no new ground or real characters here."
3,"Great imagery, with some bizarre inclusions...","I could go either way with this book. I really found the descriptions throughout the book to be quite rich, which made reading go quickly because I became immersed in the scenery. Also, the author did a good job making the characters realistically flawed. Lily is experiencing a lot of pain, and yet the author doesn't let us sympathize with her easily. There were times that I felt sad for her and embarassed for her at all at once. The only thing that kept me from giving this book a higher rating was the somewhat bizarre addition of an unneccessary subplot, where the characters worship a Black Madonna and talk about a devine female power. This seemed off to me, as the book would have stood on its own without trying to inject a feminist self-help group that made me think of ""Fried Green Tomatoes."""
3,Great characters,"I loved the characters in the book. I loved how Kidd develops each one individually and uniquely. The descriptions of the ladies and how their hats represented who they were was outstanding. They were, in my opinion, what made the book worth reading. The story itself wasn't bad but it wasn't as wonderful as I had been anticipating with all of the positive press it's been receiving. It did, however, have it's moments. Moments of funny, sad, scary, ridiculous, etc...it stretched the gamut of emotions but ended up being a little too sweet and kind of strange. Worth reading...but not award-winning."
5,One Of My All Time Favorites,"This is the first book I have read that has caused me to finish the last page and turn back to the very beginning to read it all over again. Simply put, I loved this book! The author writes with such vivid description that the words melt off of the page and become a movie for your mind. I loved the characters, Lily, Rosaleen, August, June and May. Now that I have finished the book, I find myslf wondering what they have been up to since I last closed the book.Buy this book!!! You will not be disappointed!!!"
4,Good One...,"Overall I did like this book. It was hard to get past the first chapter; it was very slow and hard to read. I thought it was going to set the mood for the whole book, but the author stepped it up and really made you interested in the book.Lily is a sad girl who doesn't fit in because her Dad makes her feel awful about herself. Her dad is basically a jerk who doesn't care about her at all; it's quite sad. Eventually she runs away and learns that she has a better life living with black people than with her white father. *This book was set back in the times when black people almost had no rights whatsoever!* I believe Lily is right in running away and living with August and her sisters. She has a better life and finds out how to love herself and others. She also learns that she can be loved, which is huge in this story because Lily doesn't believe she can be loved by anyone.I do recommend this book to others. It was a pretty fast read once you got past the first chapter."
1,Slow to boring at best.,"I heard this book was a great weekend read, I was disappointed in the slow story and very predictable ending."
4,A Mistreated Girl Finds Love and Acceptance,"Wow! This book has almost 1,500 reviews. That's great because this is a fine book, one that should be read by many people. However, I'll keep my review on the brief side so as not to repeat what has already been said many times.This book is a tender read about a young white girl who grows up motherless after accidentally shooting her mother as a child. She lives with her sadistic father and eventually runs away. After many days on the road, she finds herself in a community of black women who raise bees for honey. They take her in and treat her with warmth and love.This novel transmits a sense of the south and the sensitivity about race and bonding are truly superb."
5,SECRET LIFE OF BEES,THE INTENSITY OF SOME OF THE SITUATIONS IN THE EARLY CHAPTERS ARE NECESSARY FOR THE STORYLINE. DON'T GIVE UP. IT'S A BEAUTIFUL STORY JUST AS THE LIFE OF THE BEE IS ONE OF GOD'S WONDERS.
4,nice reading,"I read this book immediately, as I wanted to do so before seeing the motion picture. It was a very good depiction (to me) of how times were back in the day. I really wanted it be to a little longer and was disappointed when it ended. I saw the picture and urged other who had seen it, to read the book since so many of the details were missing from the picture. I would recommend this book to teenagers."
4,Not far from true life,"The Secret Lives of Bees is a page turner. Lovely story set in the South. Some reviews mention that black women are portrayed unrealistically. But I disagree. For that time period, and with racism, lack of education for black women, it was very sad but true to life. Rosaleen was an example of a poorer black labor worker on a peach farm. I don't feel the author tried to portray her as a ""mammy"" character. It would have been totally unrealistic if Rosaleen were portrayed tha way some reviewers would have liked.I felt some parts of the book were a little drawn out. The honey ritual with Mary for instance."
3,Never received item,I am still waiting for this book. Requested shipment details - never got a reply. Please ship it ASAP.
5,Excellent story!,"I just could not put this book down! This is one of those stories that bring out several different emotions in you while you read it. Excellent book, highly recommend!!!"
2,At least I learned some neat trivia about bees,"This book is a typical case of a liberal white female author wearing slik gloves while writing about black women. The result is one-dimensional characters either brimming with stereotypical ""colored wisdom"" or white male racism. It is becoming such a tired concept. If the author had dared to give her black characters some human flaws and her white men a dash of good, the story would not only be a bit more believable, but it might have had more impact as well. As it stands, it is impossible to take seriously at all.Language-wise it is quite cliche-ridden and bloated with its ""Southern-ness"".The main character, Lily, is a likable enough protagonist, and I especially liked her ponderings about and longings for her late mother. The father figure, however, is simply unbelievable and uninteresting whose only purpose is to be evil.Not recommended - not even with scuppernong jelly..."
3,Part Two Needed,"Wonderful beginning of a story, however the end came too soon and not because it had to. Great writing, vivid descriptions, simple ending. This is the first book that has been made into a movie that I would suggest taking in the movie ""instead"" of the book."
5,Wonderful !,"I loved this story...the characters, the colors you can imagine in your senses, the feeling of the times and places...I bought this book for my grand-daughter but I read it myself and fell in love with it...."
4,Very entertaining,"This is a truly entertaining work of fiction. This story was well written and ended with a satisfying conclusion. It was a true page turner. I could sympathize with the characters and enjoyed the progression of the story. If you want to be kept amused, read this book."
3,"Disappointing, Depressing, (and Deceptive)~","Disappointing, Depressing, (and Deceptive?)Yes, I enjoyed reading this, well put together story.Nevertheless~The characters in this book would have been, just as strong, without the idolization of the Blessed Mother. Nothing against the Virgin Mary ...however, it was over-done and obsessive!Sue Monk Kidd was pushing her own spirituality.(as seen in her website). The spiritual innuendos in this book were unnecessary, and offensive. I guarantee you, if this were to be a movie; Hollywood will not glorify Mary as they do in this book. Mary; as usual, was given the rank of Christ.Ms Kidd, write without agenda's!"
4,A Good Read - especially for book clubbers,"I enjoyed reading this book, especially because of the issues around strong women and race relations. My only disappointment with the book is that I felt there was no real conclusion. I was left wanting to know what happened next with all of the characters, but from what I've read there won't be a sequel. These are great characters and I am sure you will emjoy this book, especially as a topic for book club as so many interesting isssues are played out in the narrative."
4,Wonderfully Inspirational Characters,"I thought this book was wonderful. It was a fairly simple story, with inspiring characters. They had such a unique circle of freinds, and I truly felt that the characters are what made this story special. I highly recomend this book, it was easy to get into, and hard to put down."
4,School Reading,"I chose to read this book over three others in a class assignment for my junior year english class. At first I didn't know if I wanted to read a book about an abused girl in the 60's. It turned out that I recieved the book the friday before Spring Break (which last a week)and finished it the wednesday of the next week. That was only 6 days to read! I loved the book very much but I was a little dissappointed with the ending. I'll admit that I cryed when I read a ""certain"" part ;). I got very involved in this novel and definitly recommend it to other young readers(12-whatever) as it strikes deep to the teenage mind of closure and independance.Don't pass up a chance to read this novel. It doesn't take long and it will give you some inspiration for keeping your attitude to the general public good."
5,"Took this book along for the ride,","The Secret Life of Bees, by Sue Monk Kidd went to Chicago with me on the plane ride to and from. Couldn't think of a better traveling partner to take along! Buy it, try it, and enjoy it!"
4,A pleasure to read.,"Enjoyable, quick read. Author develops interesting characters that one can relate to and share an interest in their fate."
5,"A great, tight novel","After reading this book all I could do was marvel at how adroitly the author maintained the selfish, confused, scared, yearning voice of 14 year old Lily in a South on the cusp of great and painful change. Lily does not become (unbelievably) stirred beyond her own concerns to great social action, rather she lurches from one event to the next as any child would and we experience this slice of time through her naive and distracted eyes against a colorful backdrop. This book is vivid and well paced."
5,An amazing book!,"From the very beginning of this book I was hooked! The author does a great job of always making the reader wonder what's going to happen next or what the character is thinking. Not only was I intrigued in what was happening to the main character, Lily, and where the story was going. I also connected to the book in many different ways. Feeling the connection to the character and her story made me want to keep reading and find out what was going to happen. I never felt like the book was boring or uninteresting. Kidd, the author, did a fantastic job of keeping the story going and showing the reader what parts of the story were more important than other parts. All the way through the book I was captured by the story. Not wanting to book this book down made it much easier to read and I think it would be good for anyone who loves a ""real"" story."
3,The Secret Life Of Bees,"It's a good book, interesting story, well written. It's a fast read. We read it for our book club. Most of us liked it. A couple people were dissappointed and felt it could have been better. It's not on my favorite's list, but it was worth the time."
4,Great for book-club,"My book-club liked it more than I did, although I was the one who picked it out. It was a good book, I just don't think it will be that memorable to me in the long run."
5,Well written....AMAZING BOOK,This author paints the picture like no other I've read. Her story is brillantly constructed and is full of amazing quotes that I personally dog earred to read again & again!
4,Very Enjoyable Read,"I listened to the audio book and Jenna Lamia does a great job at presenting this work. Some audio books, even if they are good books, are ruined by bad readers, but Lamia does the book justice. The story line is good and one feels closure at the end of the book. Sure, some things that happen are a bit magical, but then it fits the style of the book - a through the eyes of babes point of view will most likely lead to a bit of magic.I felt this read was well worth my time and enjoyed it thoroughly."
5,a heartfelt story,this is a wonderful book! i listened to it on cd and the narration was wonderful. i would highly recommend listening to it as well as reading it! the story of lily owens touched my heart! a must read!
5,The Secret Life of Bees,Great book. Kidd captures a lot of emotions and issues from 1964 and turns them into a positive experience. Worth reading.
4,Reality Check,I could not put this book down...it made me laugh out loud and cry at the same time. I found myself day-dreaming about how blessed my childhood was (and I've always thought that somehow I got the short end of the stick as far as childhoods go) and thinking about Lily at random times throughout my day. The Secret Life of Bees was a reality check for me and gave me a renewed feeling of thankfulness for the life I have lived thus far. I definitley recommend this book....but be aware it is a quick read and not an intense complex novel.
3,Good read. NOT good literature,"This novel tried too hard to matter. The trying was so obvious it got in the way of the novel. Set in South Carolina in 1964, it attempted to explore serious race issues in the deep South. Almost everyone was a bigot in one way or another, except Lily, the teenage protagonist and a couple of the beekeeping sisters she found refuge with.Sadly, Lily's character in this ""coming of age"" novel was clichéd, down to the fact that she planned to be a writer when she grew up. The plot cruised along, however, making the novel very readable - unfortunately, the characters were two-dimensional, and the situations they found themselves in, largely contrived.The parts dealing with beekeeping, on the other hand, were wonderful."
5,Amazing- get lost in this book.,"I got lost in this book- the first of Sue Monk Kidd's that I have read. I could feel the heat and sweat of South Carolina and taste the honey she described. It took me back and made me want to be there, too. Must read!!"
2,eh it was ok,"ok so heres the deal, I don't know how many 17 year old boys would like this book but I know I didn't think it was the greatest in the whole world. there was a lot of things that happen in the begining of the book, that don't ever make sense in the end of the book. Secret life of the bees how does that play in? Our lady of chains?? How does that play in? But I do have to say, that the author does a good job developing characters, and the emotional connection is there too."
1,An Attrocious Book,"The number one question in my mind is how was this book a Ny Times Bestseller? Not only was it dull and tedious, but a first grader could have wrote a better book. Frankly, it was a waste of time and money."
2,A disappointing read,"I bought this book not realizing that Ms. Kidd has radically changed her views since the last I had read of her, admittedly from a long time ago. I give this book two stars rather than one because it was beautifully written. However, I was very disappointed with her view of spirituality, and the use of an oddly chosen Madonna statue that became an object of worship for the women in the house. I had to skim over pages detailing adoration of the statue and conversations about Mary being ""everything"", ""the mother of thousands"", etc. I was not aware that Ms. Kidd's book would represent ""feminine divinity"", and so I would not recommend it for anyone unless they are interested in ""feminine divinity""."
1,I burned this book after finishing it,"I was a freshmen in high school and I was supposed to read this book alongside Ellie wiesel's Night. It was a terrible novel to follow up. and I hated everything about it the whole way through. I can't even remember it. I don't really remember why I hated it so passionately, but I still have some of those shattered memories haunting my brain telling me that is a poor novel. It probably works better as a movie for all I care."
3,Just ok.,The Secret life of Bees is just ok .. Readable but nothing that I will recommend it to others.
3,No secret life of man,"This book was interesting, but the men really were cardboard figures. I was hoping they would have more human qualities, as in ""Poisonwood Bible"" and ""Shipping News."" The book celebrated the special qualities of nurturing women, but was very one-sided. The feeling of the deep South came through loud and clear. There is more to the ""Circle of Life"" besides maternity."
2,PAJ,This book was selected by the school for my son's summer reading for his AP English class. The book was in great condition when received. The only problem I had with the book was the content. The language was not appropriate (profanity). The school had no business selecting this book for summer reading and the author needs to reconsider their choice of words. Thank you.
4,Reading club book.,The book I ordered came in a timely manner in the condition described. I would order from this company again.
3,A pleasant read,"This book grew on me, though the initial racial incident which sets the plot in motion struck me (and several other members of my book group) as absurdly improbable. The beekeeping metaphor is intriguing but at times a bit forced. The characters are quirky and endearing, but not terribly believable. The evil father of the protagonist, in particular, is more a cartoon than a character. I have read much better treatments of the civil rights era, the parallels between humans and the insect world, and the solidarity of women. I have read books in which the characters were infinitely more complex and interesting. The part of the book that I found convincing was the intense longing of the central character for her mother, whose untimely death leaves her with only a handful of memories and objects around which to reconstruct the past. Her nostalgia for a parent she hardly knew was palpable and deeply moving, and made me appreciate the gift of having known one's parents."
5,The Secret Life of Bees,"I read the Secret Life of Bees for my literature class, and I thought it was a great book. It is a wonderful coming of age novel. It is about a girl named Lily whose mother died when she was very young. Her father is horrible to her, so she runs away to a Tiburon, a city she found on the back of a picture of a Black Mary that was her mother's. Sue Monk Kidd is very descriptive about everything. It is a little hard to follow in the beginning, but then once you get past that part, it is really good. I really enjoyed reading this book, and I recommend it for anybody 7th grade and above."
2,was expecting much more,"If it were possible to be overly predictable and extremely far-fetched at the same time...then life would mimick this storyline. Fortunately for us all, life is usually neither of these two ends of the spectrum. This book is not even one you can ""get lost in,"" as I was stuck questioning the ridiculousness of the plot. I gave it two stars only because I was somehow able to push myself to finish the book."
5,Excellent story from beginning to end,I loved this book. As soon as I opened it and read the first page I could not put it down until I was finished. Heart warming story. I also enjoyed the bee facts that related so much to the characters in the book as well as the personal lives of readers engaged in the novel. Directed properly this would make a great movie!
5,Comment to The Secret Life of Bees,Sue Monk Kidd describes in a very nice way the racial problems and the situation in the South in general. It is a very moving novel written in a beautiful language.
3,Insight into Marvel Comics in the 1990s,An interesting and at times slightly trashy look into the goings on at Marvel Comics during the 1990s. Fun for any comic book historian.
4,Corporate finance meets fantasy,The story of how Marvel Comics ended up where it is today is one filled with legendary heroes and villains. The wise old sages such as Stan Lee and the original founders mattered little when Carl Ichan came in to do what he does best. The writing style is fantastic in this book and you get a story about corporate mergers that heralds back to Barbarians at the Gate. This story is a great read and I highly recommend it for those interested in corporate financial policy.
2,Jumps around,"This book would have been better with a better editor. It is a complex amount of happenings, and I found myself forgetting who was who."
4,Hot Dog and Bun,"The artist has captured the essence of the male compassion and desire for a sustained relationship with the female sex. His ""Dylan"" like voice is perfect for a song with the deep undertones this song possesses. The lead riff's are especially strong complementing the complexity that evolves as one becomes engrossed in the story that is being told.With a strong band backing this artist I can't believe it will take long to see this one hit the charts."
2,Outdated,"Because I disagree with the beginning premise of this book it is difficult to be objective. The book presuposes that the reader is going directly from law school into solo practice. I have seen a few of these types of endeavors and find them to be universally disastrous. Worse, the lawyers who do this don't even realize what a disaster they have created. I think everyone should have some actual experience after law school before going solo. That said, I suppose if you are determined to go straight into practice, this book would be useful. However, if you have any experience actually practicing law, you do not need this book. On top of that, the marketing ideas are like something from the 1950's and have little if any present applicability."
5,Enough specifics to make price worthwhile,"Couldn't get it at the library, so took a chance and bought it. I've been in business a while and just wanted supplement existing knowledge. There are some REALLY bad books in this category- I think its worth about $30. I would refer back to it."
4,Useful book on basics for a law practice,"I found the information in the book to be helpful but a bit more general than I had hoped. Still, it is an excellent reference source and enjoyable to read. I would recommend this book to someone starting out in a law practice, particularly a less experienced attorney, along with other books on the subject that delve into more detail concerning the nuts and bolts of solo practice."
4,"Great, but needs up-date",No one can deny this is a great book for lawyers. It has many tips andgood ideas for the lawyers. But some documents are a little bit old.That's why I rated 4-star.
2,"Hmmm, Great for Bumping Heads while Handstanding","Listen to coming of age sage, self expression cretion excretions, scramblin babbilin monotone, some hefty lefty righty pickin pokin snappin drappin -with some good mind over matter sun spots-, words of coping, dealing, enunciating, finding, gathering better than some, exterminator bags you don't open in public for others...oh, but stop, look, listen, is it a train? no, it is expressive art...so be it like art, pick n poke n prod n plot, xexpresslessly (less the less) wrapped, packed, zipped und blitzed, Danke Schon Dawn Key"
4,Good introduction to Barretto's Fania years.,"This collection skims over many Fania recordings and features Barretto's different bands. If you don't own any of Barretto's salsa recordings, this compilation is a good start.As for the sound quality, it is better than most. These tracks seem to be remastered. Remember, as previosly mentioned these classic tracks are taken from different periods (60's-90's)and as such, some do show their age a bit."
3,Is this the right dose for you?,"Each of these capsules contains 500 mg of Hoodia Gordonii (aerial parts) concentrate, and 500 mg of Glucomannan (root). [""Glucomannan is used for constipation, weight loss in adults and children, type 2 diabetes, blood sugar control, and lowering cholesterol."" - WebMD]After doing much research on Hoodia, I have found that the effective dose for suppressing the appetite is approximately 2000 mg. I am 4'9"" tall, so typically, a low dose of almost anything will work for me; however, such was not the case for this product. I did indeed find the effective dose to be 2000 mg IN A SINGLE SERVING. Needless to say, you may go through this entire bottle of 60 Vcaps in only 2 weeks depending on what you need to maintain appetite control."
3,Mostly psychological,"Take this expecting it to curb your appetite, and it probably will. The placebo affect is very powerful for things like this."
4,Reduces hunger,I must say that I am less hungry and I think this pill does work. Itz not like its a miracle pill or something. Itz just a natural herb. But I think for the price it is worth it.
4,A fun book,This simple story integrates learning about the natural world with learning about geometry. The origami element allows parent and child to interact outside of the book. One minor criticism: the origami diagrams are sometimes easy to miss (they're tucked away to the side). But a parent's eye should catch them.
2,Terrible Movie,"Wow, this is why they fired this guy from Harry Potter. He can't take a book with a ton of scenery and character development and make it into a movie. I know it is a kids book, but the director bombed this one. Too bad there will not be sequels because the books are great."
3,Excellent....ish,DVD works great before and after the huge scratch. Too bad there is still a scene i have yet to see in the movie...... Good thing I paid less than $5 :-)
1,"Hey Idiot Film-Makers, Good Luck Making ""Sea Of Monsters!""","I read the book and watched the movie...I loved it!THE BOOK!!!!!!!The movie is SO STUPID!!! The resemblances? It has a kid named Percy...maybe some more... Why can't they make sea of Monsters? Here's why:1. They don't show you Clairese2. I don't think you can poisen a stupid gate...It is supossed to be a TREE!3. I only watched it ONCE...and I'm pretty sure Percy destroys Luke...4. Percy is in High-School...that defeats the whole ""At the age of Sixteen"" part of the Prophecy!Also, there is no fight with Ares...I think we are missing something here! Not to mention Percy brings a phone to Aunty Em's Garden Gnome Imporium...which is stupid because having a cell-phone(or at least using it)is moreless saying ""Hey Monsters! Come And Get Me!"" Oh, and another thing, they don't even show Kronos! WHAT THE HECK!Read The Book First! Then watch the movie and start complaining!"
5,It is a classic,For some reason I have watched this over and over on cable TV. Thought I better have a copy. The sound track is awesome.
2,Nothing like the book!,"If you've read the books, you will not like this movie. Many of the characters from the book are missing and the ending of the movie was horrible. Rick Riordan should do like the Spiderman movies and create a new film that actually follows the books!! This movie was a great disappointment."
2,Disappointing,"I have not read the books, but based on their popularity I am relatively certain they are better than the film. I was expecting a film of similar quality to Harry Potter, I wasn't satisfied with the outcome. Chris Columbus is a decent director, the first few Harry Potter movies which he directed were alright, and The Help is good, but this was a miss. On a similar budget to the first Harry Potter movies, I was expecting something as visually appealing as those movies were, but the CGI in this film looks unnatural, it makes it hard to get into the movie. The dialogue is pretty bad and the characters are more like caricatures, they are very one dimensional. This is a silly film that I expect a younger audience (grade school age kids) will appreciate, but I just couldn't get into it."
2,disappointing,"What a disappointment. After all, the book was terrific and the director is someone who has done 3 of my all time favorite movies (the first 2 Harry Potter, and Adventures in Babysitting). Too many things were changed or omitted which totally changed the ""feel"" of the book. The movie seemed rushed to cram a lot in, yet too many key topics were left out. First, the Luke-Kronos relationship was left out, which is the main plot of the 5 book series. Then, the age of the kids were changed from 12 to 17, which blows away the age 16 prophecy part.The acting was pretty terrible, too. I would not be so harsh with my review, except that I know Chris Columbus can, and has done so much better. Perhaps he was trying to avoid the obvious similarities with the Harry Potter series (2 boys and a girl battling a once-destroyed evil from coming back to power...), but in the process, the spirit of the novel was lost."
1,Horrible script and horrible acting,"I saw this movie in theaters and I would hate for anybody to waste their money by buying this movie outright. The storyline was rushed and absent any character development. The acting was just atrocious, even laughable at times. The token funny man's jokes fell flat and seemed forced. Just a horribly put together movie."
4,Don't read the book first!,"I'm a huge believer that the book is ALWAYS better than the movie. That remains true in this case. The movie is good, but my advice is DO NOT read the book first."
2,So So CG. Weak story. Not entertaining at all for a man over 40,"I had not read the books and I am no fan of Harry Potter. I just watched it as it is and found it boring. The CG is so so, or even substandard. The fights with the multi head dragon, Medussa and the final fight are not exciting at all. The story is too simple without any twist and you can easily tell who the villain is in the very early part of the movie. I just found out from the first review that the original story sets the age of the little heroes at 12. For sure I had been tricked by the movie makers' misrepresentation. For grown ups, not recommended!"
2,"Dear God,","It's bad. Oh man, it is so bad. It's B movie start to finish. BUT, it's Percy Jackson and even though it is so poorly done it is so good to see it come to film that, well, it's okay. I just hope that some good film maker takes it in and realizes that it could be really fun. Not great because it just what it is: a cool kids tale. Which is all Riordan ever meant to do.There could be so much more though. Half the story was left out, including all the references to the continuing story. Like I said, it's bad. But it's Percy and it could be so much more. I will continue to hope. (It was kind of a little bit of a guilty pleasure though. The CGI guys were having a great time.) Bad though, campy bad. It may become an epic of campyness in time."
2,Confident this is enjoyable...,"If you're 10 years old.Otherwise, as a regular film fan, you'll find yourself stumbling across the massive plot holes and choking on the ridiculous story. There's ""suspension of belief"" for a film's sake - and then there's just plain ol' mind boggling moronic.I could do a point-by-point deconstruction, but what would that accomplish? It's like discussing middle east politics with the self-same ten year old, whose glassy eyed stare of boredom would be your only reward.The best elements, and usually a bad sign for any film, are the special effects - which are decent-to-pretty good.If you have young children - this is a 'must see'. If you're as old as a teenager this is a 'might rent'. And if you're an adult this is a 'must pass'."
1,"Book was great - movie, not so much.","I really, really wanted to like the movie. I did. The actors playing the ""children"" are way too old and the acting is sub par at best. The script was tired and not even the inclusion of Pierce Brosnan and Uma Thurman could help this pitiful exoerience. For such a popular series you would think they could have made a better movie. The books and audio books are fantastic and I recommend sticking with those."
4,A fun movie,"As reviewed by my 11year old daughter:This is a really good movie. Its isn't quite as good as the book though. The special effects were really cool, and I liked the hydra especially!"
4,Probably more suited to 10-16,"I enjoyed the movie but bought it to try out for my 6-year-old son. I think there are parts that he'd need a little more background to understand. It has made me curious about the books, though."
1,Not a good adaptation.,"Too many changes!! good acting, good effects, but the screenplay was just to different from the original book. It has potential, but is was not true to its roots."
2,Could have been much better,In ancient Greek literature the stories of the gods were vehicles for profound insights into human nature. Don't expect that here. This movie makes the Greek gods into comic book characters. Missed opportunity. Instead of playing to the lowest level it could have raised us up.
2,Flashy Fight Scenes Replace Original Story,"After reading The Lightning Thief, I decided to see the movie adaptation.To my dismay, the movie was a disappointment. In general, it doesn't bother me when film makers change a book's original story when adapting it to the screen. As long as it has a good story and interesting characters, I'm happy. This is where the movie The Lightning Thief went wrong.It seems the film ignored the strong storyline of the book, and instead of progressing in its own unique direction, the film substituted the potential quality of its story with flashy fight scenes, shallow dialogue, and static characters. It's just another shallow adaptation of a thoughtful, complex book. Rent it if you must see it. Not worth buying."
3,SOMEWHAT GOOD BUT NOT GOOD OR GREAT,"Based on the popular novel series. They changed the ages of the main characters as well as some of the story angles which decreased my enjoyment of the picture. There are a lot of big names in this piece but I think what could have been a a great movie is only somewhat good at best. Too much focus on CGI and the like and not enough on plot points which connect fluidly. Most of the actors and actresses do a commendable job. In addition, this is a good starting point for kids learning about Greek Mythology. All said, the first book is better. Best supporting actress was Uma Thurman as medusa. She had the best line, too, when she told the main character, ""Son of Poseidon. I used to date your Daddy."" MY GRADE: B minus to B."
2,Don't expect to much,I found the film over all poor. I was expecting a better film than I saw. With todays high tech effects and scripts this could have much better. Instead it should have been a direct to DVD movie.It looks like a good time for all at first but it felt aimed at the under 12 crowd.
4,very good customer service.,"I mistakenly ordered the wrong product from this vendor. When i realized my mistake i contacted the vendor. I got a return e-mail the next day informing to ship it back for a full refund. When the product arrived i sent it right back. I recieved my refund within less than 1 week. I was impressed by the speed of the responce, and the refund."
1,Chris Columbus Strikes Again,"Chris Columbus tried to destroy the Harry Potter movies and failed. Well he got his revenge with this one. I have seen alott of bad book to film movies, but this one was the worst. I don't know if Columbus has a inner hate for books or the people that read them, but he struck a devestating blow to this series that I am not sure it will ever recover from even if there is a sequel."
2,"Love the books, but not this movie","The books are great, with a nice darker edge than the Potter series, rousing adventure, and are just flat-out fun. The movie, however, dumps a lot of the best stuff from the books, dumbs the story down, and makes it all much more... well, I want to say ""much more for kids,"" though I suppose the books are meant to be for kids as well, but the ""disneyfication"" of the movie really turned me off. I was so excited to see the film, but had to force myself to watch the second half, cringing all the way. The under-10 crowd may really dig this flick, but otherwise, I'd say to skip it and pick up the excellent books."
2,The Lighting Thief Movie,"I am a huge fan of the books. The movie, however, was terrible. It was like they didn't want to get any of the movie like the book. It was really disapointing. :("
2,failed attempt,"Kudos to those that brought Hobbits, Narnia and Harry Potter to the screen. Everyone knows how hard it is to bring a book to life, and those that read the books expect to be a little disappointed with the movie. It's obvious that the makers of Percy Jackson (the movie) weren't looking to make sequals. It's unfortunate because it could have been the next big money maker. If you didn't read the book, then I guess it's not a bad movie - if you did read the book, then avoid this movie at all costs."
2,"Unfortunate, to say the least","I was so excited to see this movie, and then so extremely disappointed by it. I have to assume that it was just an attempt to make money as a summer blockbuster, and not any actual attempt at telling the story in the books. Based on what was presented, there is no way to go back and make the other movies. I hope that this movie is consigned to the scrap heap and that the entire series can start from scratch a' la ""Batman Begins."" Shame on you Rick Riordan for allowing your work to be defaced in this way. Back to the drawing board."
3,"Family film falls short for adults, enjoyable for kids under 10","My kids liked this one. ""A Kid movie"" meaning that it was entirely predictible and often had silly conveniences to make the plot work. Despite having gods and demi gods and very interesting historical characters it often was flat and unimaginative. Under 10 years old. It's clean and without ""inappropriate"" language or sex to offend. Violence is scary for little ones."
4,very entertaining!,My labor coach took me to see this movie after I started early labor with my second child. (hubby was deployed) I definitely kept me entertained so I could relax in between contractions. Very good movie!
2,Should not have been made,"In referrence to the first review the items listed were missed, unfortunately so were most of the suppporting characters, the back stories, the theme and any character building. The movie, although 2 hours long, seems rushed and sloppy even though the effects were great as would be expected with computer generated effects. The actors did a somewhat respectable job with their roles as defined by the script but at times Logan Lermans acting was lacking.I am sorry I spent a dollar renting this film.Stick with the books."
1,Big Disappointment,"Way too much of a break from the story line of the book, all of the complexity drops out and we are left with tired cliches. Plus, the books are accessible to my third grader, but the movie, in an attempt to appeal to the teen crowd is something I won't let my kids see for years. Honestly, Hollywood should throw this attempt on the scrap heap and try again, or better yet, let a British film-making crew have a go at it, because that's the only way the project gets handled with the finesse and tact appropriate to 3000 years of civilization. This is just awful stuff."
2,What a waste,"As a number of other people have said, I get that changes must often be made in order to bring a book to the screen. But why these changes? An enjoyable mythological romp was turned into a fairly bland teen action movie. And even on that score it fails. The young actors actually manage to do surprisingly well; it's the older ones who tended to fail. Sean Bean was shockingly bad as Zeus, the actor playing Poseidon only a little better. Brosnan might as well have been a block of wood. Only Steve Coogan and Uma Thurman managed to have some dignity (and that's debatable). It's too bad the changed plot made no sense. Starting a war was going to achieve the titular thief's goals...how exactly? Never mind, we'll just create a new action setpiece out of nowhere and hope the gee-whiz water effects dazzle. Perhaps under a another director the movie might have had a chance, but it's clear Columbus didn't get the material."
2,The Books are Way Better!,"I love this series and was excited to hear about the movie. Well, the movie was just o.k. Spoiler alert....if you haven't seen it, read no further.THINGS THAT BUGGED ME1. Annabeth -- the movie combined her character traits with Clarice and left out Clarice entirely.2. Chiron -- poor centaur costume that looked like, well, a costume. Compare it to the centaurs in Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian; or Harry Potter. Much more 'believable' in those films.3. No prophecy -- the weight of the story is taken away without it. The importance/relevance of the quest did not come through in the movie.THINGS I LIKED1. Grover -- the movie made Grover more fun and cooler than the books, while keeping the essence of him being a Goat Boy. Very well done and his costume looked more natural (believeable).2. Auntie M -- these scenes were brilliantly done.I highly recommend the entire Percy Jackson series of books. I wish, however, the movie had been made better."
2,Pretty Lame,"I saw the movie before I read the books, and was sorely disappointed. They could have done so much more with the character development, and frankly, I found this movie boring. It did not have the teamwork/camaraderie that other movies do, and the special effects were only so-so. It was over-hyped, rushed, and under-developed."
1,DID THE SCREENWRITER EVEN READ THE BOOK?????,"HORRIBLE -- So many things wrong and silly. Annabeth is supposed to be Percy's age, about 12, and blond with grey eyes -- so who's the 25 years old brunette with no forhead playing her? Clarisse, Mr. D,... where are you? They were SOOOOOOOOOO key to the enjoyment and structure of the story.I won't go on -- if you loved and read the books, stay away from the movie. I was warned but didn't listen.PS. I'm 58 years old; I read the books as recommended by one of my granddaughters, and thought they were just a whole lot of fun, and really a good read. STUPID, STUPID MOVIE.How can I give this negative 10?"
2,"okay, but...","I was very disappointed in the movie. I have read all five Percy Jackson books and was hoping that the movie would be just like it. But, unfortunately, it was not. Spoilers ahead if you haven't read the books. All the characters ages were off, and The Titans Curse there was a big problem about Percy and Thalia (who was not mentioned in the movie) turning 16. In the movie they were at least that. There was no oracle in the movie, which eliminates Rachel's fate. The scene with the hydra was completely made up. Almost all the gods showed up somewhere in the book (besides in the end), but in the movie only Zeus, Posidon, and Hades did. The list of things left out goes on, and on, and on. And the books are really good. So much got left out that if all the books get movies, the last two will pretty much be made up.The only reason I am giving this two stars instead of one is because I believe that I would have liked the movie if I hadn't read the books."
2,Sad translation,"I am a HUGE fantasy movie fan - so that being said, obviously I expect a bit of cheese. It's just the genre. But having read the books in this franchise, I was horrified by the movie to be honest. I felt like so much of it was cut out that much of what made it a STORY was removed. It's so.... fantasy cliche. It is not original in its own way anymore, and that is a sad translation indeed. I have a VERY open mind to fantasy films, and this one disappointed me. I will not be purchasing it until - POSSIBLY - it comes out as a very cheap used DVD. Even then, I'm not completely sure if I will bother at all. I only gave it two stars rather than one because I just like the genre a little bit no matter how bad the movie is, lol."
3,Definitely a disappointment,"Well, I so wanted this movie to be great. I did enjoy the books to an extent, though not Potter-worthy to me. Still, this movie had such potential. Overall, it was watchable, but not great. I don't believe the actors were at fault though. It seemed, to me, that the dialogue was the weak point. Some of Grover's dialogue was certainly ""cringe-worthy"". With better screen writing, this could've been a lot better. I don't even think many oscar award winning actors could've done much better with the script. The flow also seemed very rushed and it sort of jumped around a bit too fast. There is a lot to the story that I know they wouldn't have been able to incorporate with their budget or time constraints, but I believe the story could've been adapted better for the screen. Also, a little more time with the CGI would've paid off. As I said, it is watchable, but rent-it, do not buy it."
2,Worst book adaptation EVER!,"If you have read the series of books you will be disappointed! There are many things missing and there are thing that are not suppose to be there. If you like the Percy Jackson series, please buy-cut this movie!!!!"
3,Silly premise but entertaining enough,"I'm not going to take a lot of time with this. The premise: there is an elite group of kids running around the planet who are the offspring of the gods, Percy Jackson being one of them. This is very light fluff, folks, and as such, it entertains in spite of it's very flimsy plot. Yes, it's all very predictable fair. The acting is just okay; no real stand-outs here."
3,"Again, the book is better.","I suppose that had I not read the book, it would have been much better. :-) That's what my students told me, anyway!"
1,TERRIBLE AWEFUL SHAMEFUL!!!!!!!!!!!!!,This movie follows nothing of the book. I LOVE the Percy Jackson series!!!!!! But this is a bad movie even if it wasn't named Percy Jackson. THIS IS THE WORST MOVIE. If i could give it negative stars i would.
5,wonderful movie,"wonderful movie, I highly recommend it for ages children ages 5 and older. It is a wonderful movie...buy it! worth the purchase!"
2,Very disappointed!,"The movie was a very good movie if it wasn't based on a book. Isn't Annabeth suppose to have blond hair? Where are the strawberry fields? What about the fight with Ares? The quest? And I am very disappointed they didn't mention Thalia's tree or even the prophecy. Although it was a good movie, they ruined the detail in the book."
1,Horrible movie,"Knowing that the book is ALWAYS better than the movie I watched the movie with caution. I curious to see how the story would be shown. Well, what I watched was not even close to the novel.It is a completely different story with small pieces of the book thrown in. So very disappointing. The movie is HORRIBLE! If you enjoyed the book, don't bother with the movie."
4,"Watch the movie first, it's actually good then","I'm glad I watched the movie way before I even thought about picking up the book. It was entertaining and I loved the characters. It was really everything I wanted in a movie like this. I would've given it 5 stars hands down. That's before I read the books.Now, well yeah this movie is so bad if you read the books first. ALL THE MAJOR POINTS have been tossed aside. & I'm talking about this is the bases of the story line of the actual books and they completely ignored it for the movie. Believe me there's no way they can make a movie for the 2nd book because they cut out everything for the sequel to even make sense unless of course they destroy that movie too and just make up stuff as they go like with The Lighting Thief.The movie by it self is a pretty good film. The movie with the book is the most horrible adaptation from book to film probably ever."
3,Suffers by Comparison,"I read all the Percy Jackson & The Olympians books and loved them. The movie by comparison was very disappointing. The good: special effects like the satyr and centaurs were very well done. The bad: the acting was for the most part awful, the story was choppy and left out crucial details, and the character development was nonexistent. It might have been good had I not read the books first, but of course that cannot be undone. In short, worth watching for the special effects especially if you rent it via instant video and don't buy the DVD. I am SO glad I did not see this in a theatre, I would have felt cheated."
2,I guess if you didn't read the books it is ok.,"I watch this with a 7 year old because she LOVES Harry Potter movies and the like. She thought it was ok. Nothing great. All I keep thinking is that this is a single movie only. I was hoping for another series to wait in anticipation for each one to come out but almost from the start I was ""OH NO!!!""In short when then book is starting out in middle school and the movie starts out in high school you know it isn't a good sign. Like many people it is very disappointing to know that this had great potential and it feel flatter then a pancake. Someday I can only hope someone with the love that Peter Jackson had for The Lord of the Rings will do the same thing for this series."
2,Not a Good Movie,"I loved the books very much and was exited when my mom bought the movie. But the movie was nothing like the book! What happend? There were so many things wrong with the movie. Here are some things wrong...**Percy,Annabeth, and Grover are in high school! In the books the were in middle school.In capture the flag, Percy and Annabeth were on opposit teams and Percy captured the flag not Luke.Those are only some of the things wrong. I say read the books first and then watch the movie."
3,Eh...,"Okay, first of all, if you want this to be exactly like the books, than don't watch this. Good acting, good writing, and overall pretty interesting but totally different than the books. They changed, like, the whole point of the story. The movie pretty much had nothing to do with the books. If the characters had different names, it would be slightly hard to tell this is a movie based on Percy Jackson. And what was up with no Ares and Mr. D? Thy're like two of the most awesome characters!!"
4,I like It,The special effects are cool. The characters are interesting but I can't quit the feeling that something is missing. It runs for 120 mins but it seems short. As for Medusa this is one of the more attractive I've seen and believe me there are creepier versions out there. Totally love the centaur and the junior protector.
3,Entertaining but movie guts book of existential message.,"Well acted, enjoyed strong female characters. Some of the changes from the book were reasonable and even good. I don't expect a movie to be exactly the same as the original book. However, one change altered the fundamental meaning in a terrible way--moving this story away from a meaningful fairy tale into a Hollywood picture with a simple happy ending and no heartbreaking sacrifices. At the end of the movie through who is chosen to be left behind in Hades, the message that a hero/adult has to meet the challenge of living beyond their parent's life potential is lost."
3,Percy Jackson & the Olympians: The Lightning Thief,"A fun movie, my daughter who is 13 particularly enjoys this movie. The acting is on par with this type of movie and the storyline moves along at a reasonable pace. Good movie to sit and watch with your kid."
2,percy jackson....,I didn't like this movie because of the negative aspects in it. It could have been much better if they would have stuck with the book. The affects are good but the story lines is a little choppy. I wonder if any of this directors even read the books! The supporting actor gave the movie its worst features. I don't recommend this movie to anyone.
4,Interesting story,"My son happens to love this series which is why we are still reading it. It is an interesting story line...but theologically speaking, differs from our family's beliefs. I have to stop and tell my son that I don't agree with parts of the book and we talk about how our beliefs differ. It has Greek names which are hard for kids to read and also some difficult words to read in general- some of which I have to say ""son, I don't even know what that word even means!"" Kids seem to love it; I just think it is ok."
2,Not up to the book's standard,"If you liked the book, don't see the movie. The main storyline is missing, the stars far too old for 12 year old Percy, and the attempt to appeal to older teens makes it a bad view for all of us."
2,Jerky & Confusing,"I had high expectations when I borrowed this movie from the library to watch with my 14-year-old daughter. She had read these books several years ago so she didn't remember all the details, but that's probably a good thing judging by the other reviews here from fans of the books. As someone who had not read the books I saw it from a different perspective than my daughter. The storyline didn't make any sense. It jumps from one thing to another with no connections. Percy's instant acceptance of his previously unknown heritage is totally unbelieveable. The characters always seem to locate the one thing they need, know the exact place to go & the right thing to do when they get there. If you have read the books, your mind will probably fill in these gaping holes in the story, but for me it was just frustrating to watch."
1,"Too many liberties, Mr. Columbus...departure from the book, poor acting - not good!","There were too many changes from the book and too many liberties taken by the director, Chris Columbus. The ages were not appropriate to he story. The movie was unlike the book in too many ways. Very poor adaptation. The movie also had a mis-matched and bad cast. The acting was marginal, especially from the star - Logan Lerman. The kid who played Luke was a far better actor than Lerman. He is a poor actor, at best, and more ""deadpan"" in his delivery than the others in the movie. The girl heroine was fair. The kid who played the satir was far better and had more energy and enthusiasm than the others. Pierce Brosnan as the centaur was disturbing and almost laughable. A big dissappointment!"
3,Good.,"Interesting movie to watch on cable. I love the premise for a fantasy book. The acting was just okay. The special effects was just okay as well. However, the thought I kept having was how short the movie would be if people just used modern weapons. In a world world with semi-automatics, all this sword fighting and physical fighting would be un-neccessary. There needed to be some explanation-like bullets have no effect on demigods. Something. Plus, Medusa died in Greek Mythology. A little odd that she's walking around."
3,Good Video and Audio For a Younger Audience,"I watched this movie last night all the way through even though my wife walked out after the first ten minutes. The sound and picture are very good on Blu-ray but the rest of the movie is not all that captivating for the older audience. I happen to be older but stuck with it to the end; I suppose I was curious how it would play out.The special effects are very well done and visually convincing; the surround sound is also effective and has some powerful moments, especially if the volume is cranked up higher.If you have younger viewers there may be a place for this one in your collection otherwise watch it before you buy it. It's not really bad for its target audience but that is the question; does your collection need something else for that demographic?"
2,Too Scary for this 34 year-old kid,"I have never read the books, and have only one comment. To me a PG movie should not be this scary. In my mind. PG means most kids ages 8-12 should be fine watching it. I personally found of so scary in the first 20 minutes that I turned it off. Maybe I'm just wierd, but I thought this review ought to be in here, in case other parents are as protective of their children (or themselves) as I am. I thought it should have been rated PG-13."
1,Horrific Movie. Plain Horrific,"I'm only 25 mins in and the movie is just plain bad. I don't care of the rest of the movie is good, there's no excuse for this much flaw already in the beginning of the movie. A good movie, a real good movie, is good throughout.To sum it up it was extremely rushed mixed with horrible acting (main character is just bad) and horrible directing.Example?Don't need one. Watch it yourself and you'll either see it or you don't. If you don't see it and you think this movie is awesome than good for you, I'm just glad I can see. Thank god I didn't watch this in the theater, movies like these are just asking for.Predictable, corny, typical. Like always I'm expecting major disagreement but it's okay. 95% of the population doesn't know whats good from bad, I just hope one in ten of you find some sort of agreement. This movie is BAD."
3,Pretty Decent,"Okay, first I am an absolute fan of the book series, being a teen myself, I toatally relate to the characters. I draw fan-art on the series, that's how much I love it.*SOME SPOILERS*Good points:-Good graphics-okay plot-Acting is good-Funny, hip, movie aimed for teensBad points:-Loss of background, like Nancy Bobofit(Yancey Acadamy)and the first time he uses his powers.-The ages of the actors, book describes them as 12, in the movie they are like 14-15-Character flaws- Grover is sopposed to be timid, not confident and joke-cracking (MAJOR let down), Annabeth has ALOT more envolvment in the story then the movie depicts, they captured Percy pretty well.-Leaving out characters- Examples- Clarrise, Dionysus, Ares,etc.All in all it's okay, something I would definitly add to movie collection, but don't get your hopes up too much."
1,A waste of two hours,"If you liked the books, you'll hate this movie. Every visual that was described in any detail in the book, for instance, what the cabins at Camp look like, is completely different in the film. Major and minor characters are left out. The plot bears no resemblance to the book, and the changes are for the worse. At best, the film was ""inspired by"" the book. Save your money and don't waste your time."
2,Nearly unwatchable,"After having read all the Percy Jackson books, I had high hopes for this movie. Was I ever disappointed! The story deviated almost immediately from the book. It left out crucial parts of the book that create the overall story carried throughout the entire series. I was tempted to stop the movie multiple times. Hopefully they will not make any more movies in the series. I don't see how they could even if they wanted to since they left out all the parts concerning the Titans."
3,"No Harry Potter, but not bad","As someone who loves the Harry Potter series I was a little skeptical when I heard about this series. I like Greek Mythology but the books borrow to heavily from JK for my liking. The movie, however, was a decent flick. I enjoyed it and thought it was much better than the book."
3,"A good movie, if you didn't read the book","The book is almost always best than the movie, so it goes without saying that is the case with Percy Jackson & the Olympians: The Lightning Thief. Clarisse is not in the movie at all and it seems like they are trying to blend her character with Annabeth. Also Ares isn't really in the movie and neither is Kronos.For adaptation from the book to the big screen I would give this movie a ""D"", but that being said, I think if you haven't read the book it is actually a pretty good movie."
5,Happy,The dvd arrived as scheduled. It was sealed and in perfect condition just as it was described. Very happy with our purchase :)
2,Perry Jackson-The Lightning Thief,As of today I have not received the item-UPS is attempting totrack the item. 8/9/2010 1040am
4,Saw the movie before reading the books and loved it,I took my 6 year old son and some of my friends from work and saw this in the theater. We all loved it. Especially my son. I then bought all the books and read them and loved them too. As stated many times...the movie is not like the books. So what? They never are. Enjoy each one for what it is. If you watch the movie with an open mind you'll love it. I'm now reading the books to my son one chapter at a time before bed and he's loving the books too. My suggestion is to see the movie then read the book. That way you won't have a preconceived idea of what the movie should be.
5,The Most Amazing Movie Of All Time!!!!!!,"this movie is so Awesome!! If I had enough money, I would watch it over and over and over!!!! Thanks!!Percy Jackson & The Olympians: The Lightning Thief"
5,excellent movie for adults and kids of all ages,This movie is riviting for all the children and adults that I have had the opportunity to show it to. Fine family fun and entertainment
1,Read the book instead,"This movie is horrendous. I don't say that lightly. I'm easy to please when it comes to movies (Pretty much the only movie I've ever turned off mid-way through is Twilight... and now this). The movie doesn't even come close to doing the book justice. Save your money and buy the book instead, you won't be disappointed."
3,"Great book, ok movie","This movie was ok. The actors are all likable and they were all fairly well suited to their roles. I did enjoy seeing the kid from The Musketeer in this one. He's a cutie-pie (even 45 year old ladies can think that, right?) This movie is definitely meant for a younger generation and the kids in my family certainly loved it. All in all, it was entertaining, but it really didn't capture my attention. I was disappointed that it deviated from the book in a few ways that were unnecessary. Nothing huge, mind you, but still noticeable."
1,Extremely loosely based on the book.,"To be honest I had very low expectations of this film. It seems that I didn't learn my lesson with the Hollywood rendition of the Chronicles of Narnia. This movie was worst. The only thing they kept were the names of the characters. The actors they used were all wrong. For starters Percy was 12 years old, how could he drive a big truck? (something he never did in the book); Hades never appeared in camp Half-Blood; the pearls were given to Percy by a Nereid in Santa Monica, etc. They should have named the movie something totally different. The author should have not allow it. Please Hollywood respect books."
5,Fools will compare this to the book.,"Yes - I called you fools. Only a fool would compare a book to a movie. They are 2 different forms of media you bone heads. I wasn't interested in this movie but my 16 yr old son has been asking to rent this for a while now so I gave in. Good story, some funny moments and great special efects. My son has read the first 3 books and it did not bother him the movie didn't follow exaclty. If you are a fan of Greek Mythology, like action and can suspend disbeleif you will enjoy this movie. Looked awsome in blu ray. I probably would have given it 4 stars but here's a 5th for the fools."
1,Blu Ray disk malfunction!,"I couldn't get to watch this movie to give it a thumbs up or down. After having to replace the original disk for not playing the main feature I had the same issues with the second disk. Amazons attitude was to throw in the towel and state they would not send another disk out but just refund me. Very poor service from Amazon, I guess I'll have to buy it from elsewhere but I would like to know whether anyone else had disk issues with this blu ray version? I have tried the disks in two different machines one Poineer Elite and the all singing and dancing Oppo machine both having the benefit of the latest firmware software installed."
1,Went from 9.49 to 34.89 overnight? C'mon Amazon...,"I looked at the price of this dvd around midnight last night and saw it was 9.49, then when I went to buy it this morning, it's now a RIDICULOUS 34.95!!! What gives, Amazon??? I mean, Really?"
4,"Good fun movie, diffrent from the book.","What you have in this movie is a fun good time. it is different from the book, but still good. Its much like Stardust the movie and book were different and the same in many was but both were worth while. The blue-ray has some nice features and is worth owning."
1,"***** for the movie, ** for the BD-ROM release","Unfortunately the poor execution of 20th Century Fox has wasted my time. This is the 3rd Fox title that I have had to return for a replacement on BD-ROM. Me and the wife enjoyed the movie (luckily the DVD worked) but it's like they say ""Once you go Black you never go back."" Once you go Blu you never go back. Luckily Amazon has an excellent return policy for defective products, but I just got my player 2 months ago and have purchased 100+ titles replacing classics old and new that I had on DVD to Blu. Hopefully I won't have to go through much more of this crap. The Fox library of films includes some excellent titles that I can't wait to be released on BD, I hope they get their disc publisher sorted soon. I can't be the only one with these problems."
4,Back to Basics,"It is tempting to say, ""yeah, this is just a Harry Potter rip-off, but with Olympian gods instead of wizards, and a rehashing of 'Clash of the Titans' to boot."" That's a rather true assessment, to be honest, but it nevertheless works and is quite an enjoyable fantasy. It is fun and exciting, and worth your time. The older kids will certainly like it, and will just possibly interest them in classic Greek mythology - a standard favorite that has been too often lost in the wash of wizardry, star trekkin', time travel, Japanese robots, and video game heroes. Classical adventures are so old, they become new again."
5,Great Movies,My 9 year old has read the series and ask to watch this movie. All of my kids including my 5 year old enjoyed the movies. I would recommend it...
5,sci fi and fantasy,Percy Jackson & The Olympians: The Lightning ThiefI have watched this one a few times and still is notboring. the younger generation and some of us older folks should be enjoying this movie.the magi affects and actors are wonderfull
3,just a movie i wanted ot see,i wanted to see the movie becuase of the whole greek gods craze that there was back a year or two ago. the movie wasnt great but wasnt bad either.
5,cute movie,thought this movie was super cute. Not too kiddy but still interesting for what it was. Picture quality was great!
3,Movie and book two different entities,"If you are buying this video after reading the book and are expecting an adaptation into a movie you will be sorely dissapointed, The only thing the movie and book have in common are the title and the characters names. The plot of the movie deviates widley from the book. The movie wouldn't be bad if I hadn't read the book first but I was let down having read the book first. Buyer Beware!!!"
2,Wa this movie really based on the book? Not!,"We loved the Percy Jackson books and hoped the movie would remain somewhat true to them. Not the case here. I don't mind when movies of books take some liberties to make time constraints, but the version did not share much in common with the books other than title, some character names, and a general theme of the plot.It was a beautiful Chris Colombus production with nice visuals, but the butchering on the story when it was adapted to a screenplay ruined it for me. Maybe if you had never read the books this movie may have been marginally acceptable.Kiddies, don't try to use this movie as an easy out to doing a book report on the book. You will fail."
2,Below Expectations,Movie was a disappointment after reading the book. The clever humor was lost. Acting was uninspiring.The story line deviatinos from the book were disappointing. I got bored partway through and was tempted to stop.Reading the book again is a better use of time.
4,Current take on mythology,"Interesting take on ancient mythology put in current day time. Some parts were done really well, while others needed a different take. Overall, an enjoyable movie."
4,Hilarious dialogue + Life-like special effects = 4 stars.,"I watched this in the theatre and just now on DVD. I tremendously enjoyed it both times.The dialogue is funny in some scenes. For example, in the motel, Grover held up Medusa's head and said...The special effects are life like. The snakes on Medusa's head look scary and real. They are much better than the ones in Clash of The Titans 2010.In short, it's entertaining. It deserves 4 stars."
3,Percy Jackson,"After reading the books the movie was a bit of a letdown. Most of the stuff that happened in the movie did not even happen in the book, or happened in the 2nd. NOT the first. 2nd of all, they used older characters. Instead of Percy Jackson being portrayed as 12-13, he was 16. The age where he is supposed to end up dying or living according to one of the prophecies. So now, they are either going to have to start from scratch and come out with another first movie, or they will just have to improvise. (They will most likely choose the second) Also, Annabeth's eyes were GREY. And I think Percy's were green... Not that that matters, but when your basing a movie off of a book, it is probably best to go by the book.Although, if you have not read the books then you would like this movie. Percy Jackson & The Olympians was a good movie by itself, but basing it off of the book, it was a rip-off."
4,great movie,"Enjoyed the book, and the movie was cool. It did, as generally happens, ""short change"" the book, but it as still a fun movie."
3,I think this was stolen from a library :/,"I got this DVD in the mail today, it has Douglas County Library-Colorado on the CD - a label. Is this stolen ?!?!???"
3,Ugh! A Poor Harry Potter,"Harry Potter movie, but with the same Hollywood storyline that you have seen a million times before.Nice special effects, but terrible script (you will be asking yourself 'how did they know that?').There is not 1 single item in this movie that you could class as original. In fact the ending was so obvious, I didn't bother. Next Please!"
1,"Horrible Movie, worst book adaptation ever!","I am a teacher. I recomend these books to all my students, family, and friends. All who have read them, loved them. I loved the entire book series. I was very excited when they announced they would be making a movie. If the movie had been made to the caliber of Harry Potter or LOTR, with a close following of the story and characters, then this would have been the awesome first installment of a great set of movies. Instead, we're left with some decent action and special effects, with poor acting, casting, script, and reworked plot. I wish I had waited to watch it at home, what a waste of money. The books are great, please read and enjoy them, don't waste time watching this film."
1,Slaughtered the book,"True, if you have read the book, then this movie is terrible. If you just go see the movie, you will find it mildly entertaining. Director Chris Columbus does try to put lots of detail into the direction of photography (especially the boat ride into Hades) but the script writing assumes way too many liberties with omitting important story details. ie: Clarissa - daughter of Mars, and the God Mars himself!The book did a nice adaption of the Olympic Gods to the Western world/culture, but the movie just does not have the charming details or great character build up that the book has. Pierce Brosnan looked and acted like he wished he were elsewhere.All in all: too many rushed, left out or thrown together parts just to make it fit into a teen wanna-be movie. Not even worth renting! Save your money and wait to see it for free on TV, even then I bet you will end up turning the channel...!"
3,Could've Been Better....,"Before you go ahead and start criticizing this movie, you have to realize something: This is a adaptation of a book, so of COURSE the books gonna be better, and it ALWAYS is. I don't think I have watched a single adaptation of a book that has been BETTER than the book.I mean, yeah they could've done A LOT better, but remember, they have to change the storyline from the book so you don't know what's gonna happen. But maybe they stayed CLOSER to the actual storyline.They kinda messed it up if they are going to make Sequels (Which they are) and I have a couple reasons why.1. They made Hades the bad guy instead of Kronos.2. Luke died or something...I was disappointed that they left out the fight with Ares. That was one of my favorite parts of the book. Maybe next time they will actually READ the book so they know what to do.But, knowing Hollywood, they will probably mess it up."
3,Canned,"The writers took liberties with the source material that I though were completely appropriate, however, they kept going until the end result was a cliched mess from beginning to end. Good action sequences, afternoon popcorn cruncher when you're surfing the web and want something on in the background."
3,good movie,"I read the book to my boys and then we watched the movie. My boys really liked the movie. They want me to give it 4.5 stars. Compared to the book, the movie was considerably different. Neither the book or movie blew me away. Good popcorn entertainment, though. A few scenes could be scary for younger children. I can't think of any objectionable language in the movie."
1,Horrible,Doesn't follow the book at all and doesn't contain important information needed to understand the story. It was such a disappointment.
4,Fantastic Drawing/Design,"I like the cards mostly because of the design.The art work is nicely presented and colored mainly from dark, red and white.As for divination, the moving line is quite interesting established by the different of the first drawn card versus the second drawn card.For the interest of other reader who is interested in I Ching, there are many other ways to divine in Chinese version beside cards and coins."
4,Good book on creating shorts that have emotional connection.,"This book is as many reviews have said, good at helping you create shorts with characteres and stories that connect. I would read other books to make sure you get action and pacing in your short, but this is a good book for helping in connecting your story to the audience."
4,Simply Positive.,"The product came in very good shape. Very slick machine without a lot of buttons; mostly everything is on the remote, but you can still use the machine without the remote. I have not used all of the features yet, but I have burned DVD-R's from S-VHS and I am satisfied with the quality of recordings. I look forward to watching VHS via HDMI on a nice flat screen. I am also pleased with all of the connections available. So far, so good."
3,"Good, but...","Well, some of the things that people wrote about turned out to be true. The unit makes a soft? rattling noise when on and is very slow to respond to any command. Otherwise, I'm very happy with it's recording to dvd from the tv and playing both vhs' and dvd's. It's great as a high def recording dvd player. I'm waiting for dvrs with large GBs to come down in price..."
1,Don't Bother,"I have always had good experiences with Panasonic products and had high hopes for this machine. But it is without question the worst piece of home electronics I have ever owned. For example, when the machine is turned on it takes about one minute for it to initialize before it will accept commands from the remote. I can live with this annoyance but I can't live with my wife yelling at me every time she turns the thing on and it doesn't do what she wants right now. A bigger problem we have experienced is that after 5 months it just died. It will power up but that is it; it will accept no commands (doesn't matter whether you use the remote or the buttons on the machine). The only way to turn it off is to unplug it. My advice is to look elsewhere, I am."
4,Great Unit,"Unit works very well. Instruction manual could be condensed, or grouped by sections for each task, without having to refer to here, there, and somewhere else just to set up a specific function, otherwise great unit. Panasonic makes an exceptional product."
2,Worked great until...,"I purchased this unit August 2007. There weren't many on the market then, and the cost was approx. bet. $250-$300. Took a bit to get the hang of and had a few initial questions/problems which cust. service helped with. The unit was not perfect, but worked fine for my needs.I recently lost power for 11 hours due to a storm. When the power came back, the unit was not funtioning properly. Tried everything possible to reset it. There is a one year warranty, but since mine ran out, customer service suggested to send it for repair which could cost over $100! Very disappointed.Informed that unit should be plugged into a surge protector as opposed to a wall outlet. I will do that in the future. Now need to start from scratch researching other products. Specifically looking for a VCR/DVD combo which allows recording on both discs and vhs tapes and has a digital tuner. I haven't seen many with glowing reviews. ho hum."
2,"Crappy, buggy product","awful, buggy product. random freezes (although not as frequent with my unit as some others here.) but what i hate most is that the internal clock ""leaks"" time. that's right - you could set it at 12 noon today, and a few weeks later, it will be several minutes behind the actual time. i actually updated the OS / EPROM via a DVD that i burned and the bugs continue. as a result, i am now hesitant to buy anything from panasonic again.DVRs are such a mature product. how does one allow dreck like this get through testing and make it to store shelves?"
2,"Nice idea, very poor operation","This unit overall performs poorly. It has absolutely no error handling and will, at time, completely crash/ freeze. I purchased a DVD movie and at the very same point-in-time in the movie, this DVD player will crash, every time. My $40 Wal-Mart special DVD player can play this particular DVD movie flawlessly. A crash/ freeze requires a hard reboot of the entire unit.This DVD player also can not play certain burned DVDs without horrendous video pixelation or sound static/noise. Once again, my $40 Wal-Mart special DVD player can play all the burned DVDs I have (even my 8 year old PlayStation 2 can play these burned DVDs).Start up/ shut down times are long.The fan on this unit will arbitrarily go on and off for no reason. I will walk into the room and the fan will be cooling off the unit when the unit hasn't been on for weeks. Back of the unit will also be warm to the touch."
3,Just a replacement for a vhs recorder,"Hard to use, in fact we only use it as a player now. We use our PC instead for any video DVD recording.It is a basically the same as the early to mid year VHS recorders; difficult to program, quirky, the recorded video is not DVD quality, and every time the power goes off the clock starts flashing."
4,Panasonic DMR-EZ47V,"I did receive the unit on time and in working order. The unit was veryclean and after a learning curve, went into use right away. I'm very happy about the performance. It's a good choice."
1,Don't buy Panasonic,Command response is SLOW. Very frustrating. Timed recording is iffy. Sometimes it records. Sometimes it doesn't. I missed viewing many TV show because of it.I hate this unit. I used to trust the Panasonic brand but now I will never again buy another Panasonic product.
2,died in 18 months,"I have the DMR-ES46V, which is last years model. Nice features, but it died with code U99 after only 18 months. No repair, it is gone. Hope they have improved reliability. I am shopping today for a replacement. It will not be a Panasonic. I am looking for reliability. I am an electrical engineer and am very careful of my equipment. The unit had good cooling location and careful use."
1,Panasonic DMR-EZ47VK-rarely recorded on DVDs and never on VHS,"It took 5 days to finally format a disc out of a 6 pack of DVD+R's that we have, that's when we finally got a few things to record on it. Difficult menus and the no SD card menu kept flashing up even when we were just watching TV. Very annoying. It would not program the VCR to record. Panasonic offered me a new remote control. I doubt that would have helped any of the problems. I spent $7.75 to ship it to my house and over $21 to ship it back so I lost almost $30 on this piece of junk! Even the guy at the seller company said these combo things break way too easy--don't waste your money!"
4,Works as Advertised,"After shopping around extensively and reading all the reviews all over tne net I decided on this one among VCR/Upconvering DVD Recorders. No matter what model/brand is out there somewhere there was a terrible review on it even on the newest Sony's that I found. I decided to roll the dice on this one. I give it 4 of 5 stars. It works as advertised and after a month of use I have had no problems. My only tidbits:a) the best thing it does - It's digital tuner is pulling in about 15 digital channels from my Comcast analag cable, most of which are in high def. They are all HD versions of my local abc, cbs, nbc, fox channels plus extra PBS channels, mostly in high def. I have a feeling Comcast has something with these channels that won't allow Comcast to scramble them.b) the worst thing - If you are a channel surfer don't buy this unit. It takes about 4 seconds per flip for the tuner to pull in each station."
1,Excellent Paperweight,"I paid top dollar for the Top-Of-The-Line Panasonic DVD Recorder & VCR Combo. This unit has the well-documented Panasonic EZ-series timer glitch. This glitch causes the unit to ""forget"" when timer recordings should start, so it fails to switch on and record either VHS or DVRs. I emailed Tech Support at Panasonic about this problem. They did NOT offer to replace the unit with something that works properly. They did NOT have a hardware/firmware fix. The best they could do was send me an Email detailing a sequence of button-pushes I should execute between every scheduled recording. I used to prefer to purchase Panasonic consumer electronics, and recomend them to others. This experience with a high-priced lemon has permanently soured me on Panasonic products."
1,Horrible,"This is perhaps the worst purchase I have ever made. This DVD player is horrible. It is slow. It is hard to use. TV channel tuning is a nightmare. DVD operation is unreliable. A ""status"" window appears on screen constantly and won't go away. I had to do a firmware upgrade just to get the thing to turn on. It takes 20-30 seconds just to warm up. I hate this thing. Don't buy it."
2,"Good features, but not reliable","We've had this DVD/VCR combo for a little over a year. Now the DVD tray is stuck shut with a dvd inside it.It did a pretty good job recording and playing DVDs, but it was sensitive to locking up with anything recorded on another machine and with any scratch.Overall, I think it had potential - Panasonic just needed to get the bugs worked out."
2,Waste of Money,"I have the Panasonic DMR-EZ47V for almost 8 months. It gave me a lots of trouble. First of all it freezes most of the times. The units gets hot within 4-5 hours of operations. I have to unplag the power cord to reduce the temparature. I have sent it to the Panasonic repair ( Elk Grove Village,IL) and they says the unit is fine. When they returned the DVD player to me, the cover on the top of the one touch dubbing button is broken. The unit still gets hot within 4-5 hours operations. My other units on the shelves are not gets hot like this. I have called the Panasonic for the broken piece issue. I am not sure if I can get the replacement or refunds. I will not buy any more Panasonic product again."
1,This Panasonic recorder just not ready for the market,"The first unit is constantly lock up with error code of U99. you have to reset it. remove is not always function properly unless reset the unit again. Exchanged another set, the 2nd set sometimes will miss recording at the set time and sometimes recorded with no sound. The cooling fan seems always running even the unit is turned off for days (I can hear it and cheak the fan is running).This unit has no memory to go back where you left last on the disc once you turn off the set or eject the disc. Oh... forgot tell you -this unit can not play CD or VCD and Panasonic dare to print ""Super Multi-format recording and playback"" on the box to cheat the buyers.I thank Panasonic is not making good product as they used to. After fighting all this problems. I return my 2nd set 2 weeks later and get my money back.I am very disappointed Panasonic will sale such low quality product in U.S.A."
2,Complicated,"I have been setting up installing and programing vcr's for myself and others for years w/o any problems.This one was very difficult.Even setting the clock which should be very simple was complicated.First I did it on automatic.It took about 30 min and was wrong when it finished.With years of experiance behind me I still wound up calling customer support for help.I am going to call them today because for some reason my OTA channels are in triplicate,Three of each and all three showing a different program.It does not do well on the UHF channels.Very disapointed."
3,Wait and see,"Not sure it has froze up once, and it is not playing some dvd's.I called Panasonic they put it through some tests now i'm sending it in for repair on them. So it might be a glitch we'll see."
1,Very difficult to operate,"It is very difficult to operate. The instructions are written for someone who does nothing but plays with electronics all day. My son who is a whiz with electronics found it difficult to understand also. You get it working and the next time you do the same thing, it won't work! It's too late for us to return it, unfortunately."
2,DVD drawer stopped opening & hard to use,"Have had this for about 2 months. Worked fine if not VERY SLOW at starting up and VERY SLOW changing (HD) channels when watching tv through remote. The picture seems much better than our old DVD player, and I love receiving HD channels for the first time. However, my kids (ages 7 & 9) HATE this one because it's too slow to start and they have trouble figuring out how to switch to ""Input"" to play a video game or switch to VCR/DVD. The final straw is that the DVD drawer is now stuck closed and we've tried everything to get it open including ""Reset"". For the amount I paid (high, since I ordered directly from Panasonic), I really expected a much higher ease of use. I'm calling Panasonic today about returning it. Will look to other brands.UPDATE (Sept 2007): Panasonic paid for postage, replaced the DVD drive, and now it's working fine. We decided to keep it. We're getting more used to the controls."
4,Panasonic dvd/vcr combo.....ez47K,"This is a typical and classic Panasonic, very high quality, has most everyfeature you can think of and comes with their now standard 100-page or more super-convaluted not-so-well-written manual which requires profound patience. Reading their manuals and setting up and connecting Panasonic products is almost always a hassle, but the results that come with their products always seem to make it worthwhile. I guess it must be similar to child birth. Anyway, I'm now several weeks and several pages into my installation and learning how to use it......and I like the product :-)"
2,Worked well -- for a while,"I bought this machine on September 22, 2007. On September 23, 2008 -- exactly one day after the one-year warranty expired -- the machine died. (Well, actually the DVD drawer wouldn't open anymore, so it was as good as dead.) Over those 366 days this machine worked well. The DVD-Rs I burned were of good quality, whether recorded from videos or from satellite TV. I never had a need to try any of the machine's more advanced features. Once a month or so it froze up completely, but unplugging it and replugging it back in always fixed it. Knowing what I know now, I would have bought something more reliable -- or maybe bought an extended warranty."
2,SLOW RESPONSE AT STARTUP,"The device is slow and not very user frendly. Once the power button is depressed, the recorder is idle for about 30 seconds with the word Hello on the screen. Do not hit the power button again.The controller is somewhat complicated. Probably the device is designed to do too many things. One would find the device useless without the instruction manual. After several, tries I was able to record a TV program on a blank DVD. Also, I was able to copy a home VHS to a DVD. However, if I had purchased the device from the Wal-Mart, I would have returned it. If you want to copy your VHS to DVD, I suggest you purchase a Dazzle for your computer."
2,Sorry to have to give this negative review,"I researched the best dvd/vcr recorder combo to buy and this one really seemed to be the best option. I received it 4 days ago and today it no longer works. I can't even turn the power on. I have unplugged it and plugged it back in and it still will not turn on. I did have the opportunity to record a vhs on to a dvd on the second day and that worked out great, very good quality. But now both the tape and the dvd are stuck in the machine. There were also several things about the remote control options that seemed lacking to me. I read all the negative reviews and like some other people just figured those folks maybe don't know how to use it, or it was a fluke that they got a bum unit. Guess there's a reason people write bad reviews, just sorry I had to be one of those people. Seems like others have had good luck with this unit, this is just my experience."
1,Very frustrating!,"I've struggled this this DVR for over a year. I freezes, inexplicable skips scheduled recordings, and has made so many disks that would not ""finalize"" that I have lost count. Very frustrated and will NEVER buy another Panasonic. There is no such thing as a ""fair price"" for a product that inflicts this much pain!"
4,Panasonic DVD Recorders unable to divide title on all media,"Unfortunately, all the Panasonic DVD recorders can only divide titles with the ""RAM"" media. This is indicated by a review of the operating instructions available on their web site. Inability to split titles for both DVD-RW or DVD+RW is a fatal flaw in my opinion; and this is just a shame for an otherwise quality product!"
2,Somewhat disappointed,"I got this product to go with a new Sony 46"" LCD but have been disappointed. When I playback a recording, I get a background of faint black lines that is somewhat disturbing. Seeing that on the first recorder led me to call Panasonic and they told me to send it back to them. The second shipment was no better and I think this is just not that compatible with a Comcast HDTV box and the Sony HDTV. It works better with a standard digital converter box and my older Sony analog TV."
5,A Great Read About Mountain Gorillas and Life in Uganda,"This is a great book. Written in a clear, easy-to-read style the author does a great job of weaving together descriptions of the mountain gorillas in Bwindi National Park with descriptions of the Uganda people and their culture, the politics and history of the country and other aspects of his experiences there. If you are looking for a book with detailed, scientifically-oriented analysis of the mountain gorillas, this is not the book for you, nor is this the book for you if you are looking for great color photographs of the animals and the country (he only has black and white photos of so-so quality). But, if what you are looking for is a book that allows you to learn about a variety of aspects of life in Uganda, its people and the gorillas this is a great choice. It would be the perfect book to read prior to a trip to the region to see the park and its gorilla population."
4,MO' DIRTY REPPN,i HEARD THA ALMBUM BY HARD KNOX THIS IS REAL & HAD 2 COME N & GIVE THEM THEIR PROPS . THEY R ON THEIR WAY 2 THA TOP OF THA GAME WITH THEM TIGHT BEATS & FEATURED ARTISTS BLOWN THA TRACKS UP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1MUCH LUV.......YASAVOIR
5,I loved this book,"Funny, interesting, juicy. One of the best books on the music industry I've ever read."
1,Ramped Up My Arthritis,"I used this product for 6 weeks. Initially I saw a slight decrease in hot flashes. By the 5th week my arthritis is so bad in my hands that I can hardly grasp anything and my fingers are all swollen, red, and hot. I believe it was do to using my hands to spread this product on each night. I stopped for a week and my pain lessened. I returned to using the product a few days ago and my hands are all flamed up again.For those that said it helped with their arthritis...I don't see how it can unless it is a placebo effect.I agree that it smell is undesirable and the lotion is sticky, making my clothes stick to me at night."
5,Happy with product,"I have used progesterone creams for many years at the advice of my MD. I have tried many different products and this is by far my favorite. I find that it absorbs quickly and doesn't leave a greasy film like many of the others. It is also not watery as some that I have tried. Although I have used the unscented and like it, I really like the lavender scent."
3,Haven't noticed impact,"I have been using this product for about one month and haven't noticed an impact on my menopausal symtoms. I am currently using a low dosage of estrogen and had hoped that this product in combination would help improve the symtoms with which I suffer. I will continue to use to see if there is any improvement, but I also don't like the aroma."
5,I think it helps,I've been using it for few month now on and off. It seams that it helps to balance elevated estrogen. I have less symptoms when I use the cream.
4,So far so good!,"With a product of this nautre I want to give it time about 3-4 cycles before singing about it. I noticed that some of my monthly problems became more managable. I have just about all of the symptoms of high estrogen and this last month they had all decreased. I am looking forward to my next cycle to see if they are better, the same, or (hopfully not) worse. I feel the outcome to be good."
3,Great Product Not For Me,I should have purchased Life-flo Progesta Care Plus instead. Apparently I need estrogen replacement and not progesterone. I highly recommend life-flo products. This product did not help my hot flashes/night sweats and when I started having PMS symptoms I had to stop using it.
1,YUK!,"First of all, the cream smells like rancid oil which I found repulsive. I used it for a couple of days and broke out on my face and back like a kid going through puberty. I'm looking into returning this horrible product."
1,Smells awful -- overpowering old sunflower oil stink,"I don't know if ALL of this stuff smells of old stanky sunflower oil, but the bottle I got sure does. I spray perfume over it and it still doesn't mask the odor. I don't enjoy smelling of half rancid sunflower seeds.The cream also makes my skin feel sticky no matter how long I rub it in and no matter how many areas of my body I rub it into (1 pump, over legs, arms, belly and chest).Does your bottle smell like this, or has this one gone off??"
3,Haven't noticed a difference,"I have only been using this product for a short time. I haven't really noticed any difference, especially with my non-existant libido. I've also noticed that I seem to be gaining weight, mainly in my stomach, hips and thigh area. I don't know if I'm using too much or if that is just a side effect of this cream. I'm not too happy about it. Thought I might actually lose some pounds that haven't been coming off due to hormone imbalance. Not sure if I will continue using the rest of the cream or not."
3,Progesta-Care for Menopause symptoms,"Progesta-Care is a progesterone prooduct and in this regard it is totally what it is supposed to be. And, with the pump dispenser delivering a correct dosage it is easy to use. So, if the goal is to use progesterone, then I highly recommend this particular product. That said, I'm 61, having hair thinning, weight gain, extensive dryness but over the night sweats and hot flashes of my earlier menopause days (I've been in menopause for about 11 years)and do not find that this product is working for me. In fact, something is causing me to gain weight even faster. I've added some nutritional supplements and am horrified to see weight coming on even faster. I think the progesterone is messing up my hormones. I will give it another month to see if it evens out. I'm doing 2 weeks on and 2 weeks off of use. Good luck."
3,Progesterone amounts miscalculated,"There should be 96 pumps per bottle, but there were only 70. So is there 27.5 mg progesterone per pump or 20??? I called company. They said their calculations are approximate. I would say a would say a 28% error margin, makes their calculations less than approximate. I no longer trust this product."
3,Not too bad.,"Smells terrible, it is hard to remember to put on twice a day. Would recommend the pills over the cream."
1,Horrible Hot Flashes & Mood Swings,"I tried this cream because I was out of the one I normally use. So I bought this at Whole Foods. The minute I put it on, severe hot flashes started and stayed throughout the day, and again when I put it on for the evening. I stayed with it for 3 weeks but it only made me worse with each use, each day, and evening.I am going back to my tried and true progesterone creme; Better Health Naturally Menopause Moisture Creme with red clover extract. Life Flo wasn't the cream for me."
2,Strong scent,"Much like the unscented life-flo progesta-care, this product has a very strong ""sunflower seeds"" scent which is still quite noticeable under the lavender fragrance. If you're comfortable with the scent of the un-scented version and you like lavender, it is probably not a drawback, but I don't care for it.Life-Flo Progestacare creams are all quite heavy and greasy -- and the pump dispenses more than 1 dose if you pump it fully downward, so be careful. My skin stays sticky and greasy all day long, even when I rub it into both thighs and both inner arms! I let it soak in for 15-20 minutes, but If I don't follow up with a sprinkle of baby powder, my clothing sticks to it all day long. I don't dare use it on the chest as they recommend since my hair touches the skin there and gets greasy too - yuck! This is a bigger concern if you use it on exposed skin and touch children -- they have low body weight and it WILL rub off on them, so their exposure rate can be quite high."
3,millie with a question,"I have been using BiEstro-Care and progesta-care at the suggestion of My Vitamin store Rep.I was starting to get hot flashes at night, but that was it.Now I am dealing with weight gain as well.Can someone tell me if this is normal while the body balances? or is it the creams?I don't trust regular Doctors. They just prescribe pharmaseuticals and the Life-Flo website is oddly vague.need a womens perspective"
2,Not a cure for my PMDD,"I've been using this for the two weeks before my period and I have never had worse PMS. I feel like I could literally kill someone. After doing a lot of research, I thought progesterone cream might help me with my severe PMDD.I'm at a loss. My docs won't check my hormone levels saying it's not needed. I'm an absolute lunatic for 2 months of the months. Half my life. No one will help me and they say it's just normal."
4,Good Old Fashion Gruesomeness,"Ah yes... I remember those Saturday nights as a child, staying up late to watch ""Elvira, Mistress of the Dark and Movie Macabre."" This was one of my favorite late night ghoul-fest films, taking place in a creepy medieval village filled with the possessed teen of Satan! I remember it being a lot of fun, so I will purchase it and see if it's as much fun 15 years later! Another good movie from the 70's (or 80's?) is ""Eyes of Fire"" which popped into my memory just last week. Why don't they make creepy films like this anymore?"
3,Beautifully atmospheric horror yarn.,"This rather gruesome (but not gross-out) horror yarn has a vivid period setting, enhanced by fine photography and acting. In 17th century rural England, big trouble starts when a farm boy unearths a strange skull. Soon, the local children are into worshipping the resurrected demon. No classic, but one of the better horror films of the Seventies. Watch for Milton Reed (the British Tor Johnson) in a small role. (The R rating is due to some brief female nudity, which you undoubtedly did not see if you saw the film on non-cable TV.)"
4,Great atmospheric chiller,"This movie drew me in, starting with the starting with the opening credit shots of a raven on a branch accompanied by eerie, ominous music. I have to agree with those who say this isn't an out-and-out, edge-of-your-seat thriller--but it is still a great movie in its own way. Which to me is a combination of *actually* good (the cinematography, the evocation of 17th-century rural life) and bad/great (the often cheesy acting, the somewhat schlocky plot, stock Puritan-type characters). It managed to creep me out at the same time that I was snickering at it.Like other reviewers here, I first discovered the movie as an adolescent on TV. Could see how it might have less effect in this day and age, though. Many of the events that seemed shocking in 1970 can now be seen on any daytime talk show."
5,Hairy Demons And Bushy Eyebrows...,"BLOOD ON SATAN'S CLAW is an excellent, 70s satanic thriller. A small village is beset by eeevil after a farmer uncovers a strange skeleton in his field. Strange things begin happening and folks start disappearing. BOSC is an old school good vs. eeevil tale w/ the good represented by The Judge (Patrick Wymark), and the eeevil embodied by the beautiful Angel Blake (Linda Hayden). Ms. Hayden is especially wicked in her role, willing to do anything to serve her new master. The scene where she pays a nocturnal visit to a minister is quite memorable indeed! If you enjoy films like THE DEVIL RIDES OUT, TO THE DEVIL A DAUGHTER, etc., then this belongs in your collection..."
4,Blood on Satans Claw....,"I didn't want to watch this. I bought it ages ago after watching a tv programme which told me if I liked horror then I really should see this. It sat on my shelf for months, and then after being incredibly bored one evening I stuck it in the DVD player and bang. Its amazing. Yes, it does have all the trappings of those old hammer horror films but it's slick and grips you from the start. It's always disturbing when the innocent become corrupted, these innocents frolick in the woods before getting down and dirty to the most innocent of people, Wendy Padbury.The effects aren't great, and why they couldn't colour the blood properly in those days is beyond me, but you soon forget that as the village is slowly taken over by the guy downstairs.It's a budget film, which looks better than it should. If you enjoy the Wicker Man then give it a try...."
2,"Quite disappointing, hardly terrifying/gruesome","I was quite disappointed with this film, maybe that's because the box says that ""you have been warned"" and that it is ""one of the most terrifying horror films you'll ever see"" It had great atmosphere, it's just that I was really ready to be terrified, and I was really let down."
5,"Please,...a region 1 release.","I remember seeing this movie in the early 70's I was a bit young at the time but I still remember it well. I really hope they decide to come out with a ""good"" region 1 release clear and uncut as it should be. A must for british horror fans. I'd buy it right on the spot"
3,Shelves,"The product is fine- a little wobbly. And one of the holes that was supposed to be predrilled was not fully predrilled, so we had to do it ourselves."
1,FALSE ADVERTISING!!,"OK, so I admit that I probably should've read the fine print more clearly, but this DOES NOT come with the baskets as pictured. I am PO'd! This item is available through other vendors on amazon and they all sell it WITH the baskets so it is very confusing. There is another vendor selling the shelf and baskets for $75. Now if I want the baskets, I have to pay an ADDITIONAL 80 bucks to what I've already spent. Don't buy it from this vendor...you'll get more for your money elsewhere"
2,This is when the band started losing it.,"[...] Anyway, I'd just like to say that if you want Heaven with REAL balls (and not the rather-more-light-weight Hair-Metal that appears on this release) then try and find their first album, 1982's ""Heaven Bent"" (or just ""Bent""). This was when the band were still an Australian Hard Rock/Metal act in the vein of AC/DC (Scottish-born lead vocalist Alan Fryer, the only original member of the band appearing on the ""Knockin'.."" album, actually tried-out as Bon Scott's replacement, before missing-out to Brian Johnson) and Rose Tattoo, with ex-members of both bands and with songs that genuinely rocked, and hard. Unfortunately most of those members left after the band shifted to the U.S which helps explain the more commercial sound of this album. So, whilst this album isn't crap, it's by no means the band at its best. Check out ""Bent"", and hear how the band REALLY rocked!"
4,GOOD PRINTER...GREAT PRICE,"I have bought 3 of these so I have no room to complain. The software is a bit non-intuitive, but nothing that is too difficult to figure out. The thing comes with a 2nd tray and duplex printing capabilities on Windows, and the $305 price tag beats the pants off of any other printers. Quality wise, it's all plastic just like all of the other ones.4 stars just because of the software-configuring issues."
4,Remembering Worcester,"I picked up this book and was flooded with memories of my years in Worcester, MA. John, thank you for the terrific read. I enjoyed your stories and the details (Alice and the Hat Diner, for example). Glad for your success. I am recommending this book to friends."
2,backround music,"When I bought this I was looking forward to the blending of the flute and the harp. I have Wind Songs and some Hilary Stagg and other harp music in my collection. This CD dissapointed me. The flute is much louder than the harp and when I turned up the volume to hear the harp the flute became too shrill for my ears. My second letdown is that there is no passion or emotion in the performance. It sounds like some musicians playing sheet music for money. The musicians are very good technically, but they are performing music that they did not choose or compose and their lack of emotional commitment seems evident. Michael Hoppe wrote the music but he does not perform on any of the songs. The liner notes say that this is music to play in the background while having diner. Maybe that is what it is intended for, it's just not what I was looking for."
1,i think i got the wrong one,"i bought this at the same time i bought the safari hippo. they were the same price and i sort of expected them to be the same size. i know that papo offers a smaller version of the same item for $7, i think. i think i got the smaller one. it was a surprize gift for my son, and i did not want to take it from him because he is obsessed with hippos, and he immediately started to play with them. I bought it with a gift card, so i am not worried, i guess, but i am stuck."
5,Awesome File Handle,"Received this item in record time - really fast, along with the file. When I inserted the file into the handle it was a snug fit but when I tapped the file and handle on a hard surface the file entered completely and is GREAT. Stong and good looking. Highly recommended."
4,WOW what a great book,I loved this book. But I have to say it wasnt my favorite out of the serious I have to say it was city of and close to the ground. But I love Angel the show. So I'll keep reading and watching.
5,Daria is the BEST show on television!,"Forget Ally McBeal or Frasier or The Sopranos. The best TV show of them all is Daria! As a future animator and Daria fanatic, I can honestly say that if you're smart and have a sense of humor, you'll love this video. I'll admit that I already had these episodes taped from TV and just bought this to support Daria. Daria fans have to support the show because those morons at MTV like to give Daria the shaft. And since they rarely show the old episodes anymore, this may be your only opportunity to see them for awhile. I will warn you though, there's none of that cool music in the episodes or at the closing credits. But these episodes are true Daria classics. This was how Daria originally was. Daria rocks and that's all there is to it!"
3,Excuse me?,"Believe me, I'm one of the show's biggest fans, but there's not a great deal of incentive to purchase this video. First off, all four episodes are still being aired periodically on MTV where you can catch them for free. And they're *better* seen on MTV (even with commercials) since on the video all of the buzz-bin tunes have been scrapped in favor of cheesy pseudo-rock. I realize this was necessary to keep the licensing costs down, but it's just not the same. Further, while two of the episodes featured here (""Cafe Disaffecto"", ""The Lab Brat"") are classics, the other two are among the series' weakest episodes to date. Buy it only to support your favorite show (because God knows MTV doesn't)."
3,Good,"Good, but catch these on TV instead. There's virtually nothing but the episodes on the VHS tape (no extras), and to top it all off, the normally awesome music has been replaced with, sorry to offend, ghetto junk!"
3,Moderate,"I really like the simplicity of these. They are clear, with the once charcoal strip on the lid. It is much easier to see what is inside when you compare it to other Rubbermaid storage containers. However, these are not made of the same matter as the other Rubbermaid containers and can break. Considering the cost of these compared to others, I would have expected better."
4,Devin's Review Of Lego City Harbor,"Devin (age7) built it in a short time hardly looking at the instructions. The only help he needed was in finding the pieces he dropped on the floor! He does not yet know he is getting Lego Castle Siege (his second choice) for Christmas ! His comment, after putting it in the bathtub, was""It really floats!"""
1,Amazon need to correct title listing.of this book,"The book's title is ""Think on These Things""It is listed in multiple places on Amazon as ""Think of These Things.""When the problem is corrected, I will buy it.George Enice Lawhon"
5,great little handbook,"i love this book- it is short and sweet but it has lots of cayce ""gems"". little quotes and passages that are truly inspirational. i would recommend this to someone who is already a cayce fan, or someone who is at least open hearted to his message. what i am trying to say is that if you or someone you know is unfamiliar with cayce, this might be a nice companion reading with some more cayce material- such as there is a river, well there is a LOT out there and i think most of it is good. some better than others, and for what it is, this little booklet is helpful. of course you can't go wrong with edgar cayce, and i appreciate having these direct tidbits to go over quickly if i need a little pick me up or just pass by it on my desk and feel so inclined to open it up. so inspiring! love it!"
3,3 stars,"Not real happy about the manual. I ordered and received the Garmin 255W, but received the quick start manual for a 205W."
4,Fun and games,The Tripoly game came on time. It was as described in the write-up on Amazon. Make sure to buy more poker chips. Not enough come with the game.
3,Memories!,"Sixty years ago, the family played Tripoli after Thanksgiving and Christmas dinners. Only two elderly cousins and I are left, We ordered the game when my wife and I visited them a couple of weeks ago -- and spent three delightful hours remembering those games years ago.The flannel cloth was spot on -- except that our original was sort of an oil cloth. The chips and cards were not of the same quality.But ahh -- the memories!"
2,Not worth the money,"This item is way overpriced for what you get. The felt mat is nice, but it slides all over the place unless you put a rubber mat under it. The deck of cards are as cheap as they come. The play chips you get are a waste since there's not enough chips to enjoy the game. If this item sold for $14 or less it would be a good deal, but at the current price it's not worth the money no matter how much you like playing Tripoli. Had I known what I was buying I would have opted for a cheaper Tripoli game."
2,Not as good as I expected,"GW Battlefield of Pacifists was too rushed and fast paced. The storyline didn't really fit the characters.The whole 1x2 thing was really non-existant. Duo encouraged Heero and Relena's relationship several times and even warned that if Heero didn't keep in contact with her she'd forget him.Heero was rude to Relena-and for Relena fans, she wasn't in it hardly at all.Wufei was also out of character-Heero once said in Endless Waltz that false fronts were not his style, and that is exactly what he did when asking Lady Une about the Scorpio. The Wufei in this book kinda went with the flow just to see how things would work out for his entertainment.I wouldn't recommend for hard core GW fans to read this book unless they just want a different view and type of GW. If you want the TV shows style, read one of the other mangas."
2,Not as good as I expected,"GW Battlefield of Pacifists was too rushed and fast paced. The storyline didn't really fit the characters.The whole 1x2 thing was really non-existant. When did they rent a motel room? Duo encouraged Heero and Relena's relationship several times and even warned that if Heero didn't keep in contact with her she'd forget him.Heero was rude to Relena-and for Relena fans, she wasn't in it hardly at all.Wufei was also out of character-Heero once said in Endless Waltz that false fronts were not his style, and that is exactly what he did when asking Lady Une about the Scorpio. The Wufei in this book kinda went with the flow just to see how things would work out for his entertainment.I wouldn't recommend for hard core GW fans to read this book unless they just want a different view of GW."
1,Awful!,"After looking forward to this book for several weeks I must say I'm extremely disapointed. Not only is the artwork simple and very unlike the characters from the TV series, but the plot is very rushed and undeveloped. Heero was constantly out of character-not knowing what was going on and being filled in by Duo one moment, and being stiff and rude to Relena the next. Relena was hardly in it at all-and I would like to point out she is as much a main character as the G-boys, and Dorothy was even seen more than she was. Poor Quatre is on the crazy end yet again, and the ending wasn't very definite. I was looking for a link between the TV series and EW that might explain some things and develop the characers and their relationships to each other more. All I got was a fast paced comic book that weakly states the occurences between GW and EW. I'd suggest viewing ""Blind Target"" as the reality between the TV series Gundam Wing and the movie Endless Waltz."
5,Helpful each day of the year.,"I love this book. While his other books give a great overview, this one is wonderful because it is broken down into a little information each day. As I read, I am reminded of the changes I first made when I read, ""Men Are From Mars..."" and this book helps me to keep those changes in the forefront of my mind. I would recommend this book to everyone who enjoyed and learned from, ""Men are from Mars..."" and the other books in the series."
4,Good game,"Decent game for the money. The graphics aren't really all that impressive, but it has a decent campaign line and and excellent array of customization. One of the better open-ended scifi games out there.A must-have for any Sci-fi gaming fan!"
4,Attractive Information and Expressive Examples,"I'm new to the practice and philosophy of Feng Shui, and was intrigued by the subject matter, since I'm a Certified Image Consultant.I wanted to be able to add the Feng Shui principles to my work with clients as well as explore the possibilities for myself. After reading through this gem of a book, I feel much more comfortable with expressing my innate 'Fire' qualities. I like the recommendations for clothing, and the multiple ways of expressing other Feng Shui qualities while honoring my dominant 'Fire' was terrific! I highly recommend getting a copy of ""Formulas for Dressing the Whole Person"" as a companion to this book. The two of them together give you a step-by-step way to determine which of the Water, Wood, Fire, Earth and / or Metal qualities fit you best, and then how to combine them for maximum benefit.Louise's writing style is friendly and easily understood, making this book an easy and enjoyable read."
3,Milky white appearance,"I bought these Wilson Jones sheet protectors because I wanted to make sure my photographs don't fade. These are advertised as acid-free, archival safe. They are super heavyweight, which is actually thicker than theAvery Diamond Clear Heavyweight Sheet Protectorsthat I own. Inserting photos is not a problem, but the sheets have a somewhat milky appearance, which is noticeable when compared to Avery. When I put my finger inside the sheet protector, some of the milkiness rubs off so that I have a clear ""fingerprint"" left behind. I'm not sure what that white substance is. I hope it doesn't harm my photos."
2,Great toy - SHORT BATTERY LIFE,I bought one of each of these microids for my 3 boys. They love them and played with them a lot. The battery life is only 40 MINUTES. They take 4 LR44 hearing aid batteries which cost $2.99 each. (...) to replace the batteries it cost me $12! and the kids could only play for about an hour!
4,Back to Basics,I decided to use this book for my administrative staff. We are a small nursing home with 10 managers. We all were having difficulty dealing with the day to day stressors. This book has taught us how to have effective conversations with our staff and make better decisions. I recommend it as a basic tool to get the thought processes going to improve communication
5,Best book ever,I have given this book to a number of people. It truly is a good read. Very helpful. For those of us that can be a bit timid....buy this book.
4,Library material,"I would buy this book again, it's a good primer if nothing else. It has been a while since I read it but I do recall it being with while."
4,A Different Perspective,"I must admit, when I added this to my reading list I was skeptical because of the topic in general. But I must say that when I actually sat down to read the book and took notes, I found myself applying the tactics almost immediately. I think the book is too drawn out on the different strategies, but this stuff works, and I see my world changing for the better. I no longer argue to be right, but now I conversate effectively to gain advantage, because I have an actual goal in mind. The book is good, the advice is sound, and I would recommend it."
4,Useful Tools and Methods If You Can Implement,"I actually had to read this book for a class and develop a presentation around it so I wasn't necessarily looking to improve my communication skills when I read it. I'm pleased to say that the book actually does present a several useful tools and examples for doing just that, both in one's personal and work life. Fortunately I've been able to use some of the techniques described in the book to better communicate with those around me.The book is fairly quick read and, unless you're a master of conversation, I'd say most anyone would derive at least some value from exploring the ideas in 'Crucial Conversations'."
3,Ok Book,There are only a few points in this book that I feel are good advice. Ways to think about how to defuse a situation instead of escalation or how to win over someone by making them feel as if you are all in this together and on the same team.
2,crucial book,THIS BOOK WAS DIFFICULT TO FOLLOW AND I DID NOT ENJOY READING IT. VERY ODD AS I LOVE PSYCHOLOGY BOOK AND ANY WRITINGS RELATED TO INTERPERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS
2,Common sense for dummies,"This book offers minimal amount of original thought. Most ideas are commonsense. There is little in a way of suggestion to realize when conversation has become critical. There are also no ideas for the ways to resolve the situations ""already gone bad."" Some conflicts introduced to showcase specific techniques are not resolved convincingly. I read till the end hoping to find something of value, but was disappointed."
5,"not the first on this topic, but still great","I have read Difficult Conversations - Douglas Stone, Bruce Patton, Sheila Heen and although both books talk about how to have these 'important' discussions, they are kinda different approach. I don't intend to say that they have any kind of a prequel/sequel relationship, but just that the ideas and techniques mentioned in this book are very interesting.""Emotions don't exactly prepare us to converse effectively.""Recommended to anyone."
5,Crucial Conversations,"As an Executive Coach, I highly recommend Crucial Conversations. Many of my clients face the challenge of talking with their peers and/or direct reports on a daily basis. Most people don't handle those difficult conversations very well. This book gives great steps and info on how to go about treading through the difficult waters. I have purchased several copies of this book as gifts for clients. I am currently re-reading it in order to grasp and absorb the rich content."
4,Management Development - conversational conflict,"As with many of these management development books, there are many pages just making up pages!However the content is excellent and will be very helpful to those who regularly work in challenging environments, or even in their homelife where conversations just seem to run away or not get results.If you find this book useful - consider books on Question Thinking also."
5,Crucial Listening,"The female narrator has a crisp clear tone in her delivery. Very good for a hard of hearing listener like myself. The material is first rate, I have listened to many such books over the years, and this one boils down the essential elements to a three tape book. Quite nice.Maybe it is just burn out on my case, but the self promoting forward by stephen covey almost made me turn the tape off as I drove Interstate 80. This guy is like Dr Phil, he's everywhere and he is so...ah...perfect."
5,Really informative!,"I heard one of the speakers, and knew that I needed to purchase this book to help with dealing with this type of situation. Great tool for any leader."
5,Crucial Conversations: Breakthrough communications needed for today,"People talk less and less these days about the things that really matter, the things that inspire and hurt us, and the ending results usually mean break offs in our relationships and jobs. This book is a wake up call to all of us that somehow got the message that it's not ok to talk through things. Simple tips and techniques are offered to help us move past the discomfort of bringing up sensitive topics and onto a path where we can constructively work through issues with the people we are most heavily invested. Halfway through the book, I've begun to implement some of the tips and see a huge positive change in how my efforts are being received. This is both a great business and relationship book...highly recommended to anyone with a relationship worth maintaining."
4,Helpful,"This book helped me in my working environment and my personal relationships. I passed it along to other people in my family so we all can communicate a little better. It's a work in process, but a re-read of this book will help. Stellar!"
5,Change Your Life,This book can truly change your life! It teaches you how to have difficult conversations that we are not usually born knowing how to handle very well. I have known several people who commented how it helped their interpersonal relationships as well work realtionships. This book is the best value for your money. I recommend it highly!
5,Absolutely imperative for successful communication,"If you're looking at buying this book, just click ""Add to Cart"". This book is an essential tools for anyone who wants to be an effective communicator in any situation (personal or professional). Today's most effective people are not those that have the most/best information, but those who can communicate the most effectively - this book will get you there! Period!"
4,a story or fact,"This is a very good book if you find yourself working in a new industry that operates differently. Also, if you find yourself in conversations with others that are contenous or you don't seem to communicate. Then this is a great book to understand the dynamics."
4,good collection of practical ideas - need more examples,"Although this book takes far to long to get to the point, it is a worthy collection of well structured ideas that can really be implemented.More worked examples would help, especially illustrating how all the acronyms they come up with representing techniques fit together. Many of the ideas are well known, so the benefit of this book is to bring so many ideas together in a digestible format."
2,Crucial Conversations,The book is good but I had a problem downloading the book into the Kindle icloud reader. I would not recommend Kindle icloud reader because you have to be online to read. I would recommend Kindle reader but I have not had any luck in transfering the book to the Kindle reader.
4,Tools for Talking,"It has worked examples would help, especially illustrating how all the acronyms they come up with representing techniques fit together. Many of the ideas are well known, so the benefit of this book is to bring so many ideas together in a digestible format.Also other book about relationships, self- help and communication isI Love You. Now What?: Falling in Love is a Mystery, Keeping It Isn't"
2,Nothing new in this book,"Nothing new in this book, it copies things from other books and audio cd's. It is a ok read, but not sure if I would recommend anyone to read it. One thing I totally didn't like was the chapter telling you that sometimes it's ok to go to bed angry. I was thought never go to bed angry and I do not think that is a rule to break."
1,What a terrible book !,"What a terrible book ! Almost an unintentional parody of the business self-help genre, with catchy acronyms, a process (training in which is sold by the authors, of course),self-important diagrams and little over-generalized situational ""nuggets"". It's sad that business feels it has to resort to charlatans of this ilk."
5,Excellent!,"I have always been quite squeamish about talking to others when the stakes are high. Somehow I always seemed to make the situation worse, not better, when it really mattered, but I didn't know how to change. Shortly after reading this book, I had a situation come up where I was going to have to have ""A Talk"" with a relative. Instead of my usual sense of dread, the first thought that came to mind was actually, ""oh Good, a chance to practice having a Crucial Conversation!"" I applied the principles from this book, the conversation went smoothly, and it was a very empowering experience. Now I have it on my desk for easy reference, and I definitely recommend this book."
4,Shall Be Useful For Average Conversationalists,"The book contains some commonly known ideas. The authors conceptualized them and organized them systematically. It may be too ""easy"" for skilled and mature conversationalists.A strength: it was more than outward skills to ""manipulate"" other people. It encouraged people to develop genuine relationship, e.g. self reflection, empathy, win-win achievement.Other strengths of the book:The whole chained process: get ready to dialogue dialogue decision making assignments.Not only about handling yourself, but also our counterpart in a conversation.There were advices on specific circumstances.Simple language, useful examples. Easy to understand and not boring to read.Readers usually doubt how much of the skills can they really pick up. This is always a concern to me, but I think at least weakness/problem awareness can help. The last chapter actually talked about how to absorb and to use the skills learnt."
1,Are you kidding?,"I had this book as an audio book and I am amazed how could anyone give it more than three stars. Cliché advices and rudimentary observations abound. Not worth the money let alone the time. Maybe useful if you were not part of the civilized word for last 10 years and know nothing about a dialogue, communication and such, but if you want to improve your communication or persuasive skills this will not get you beyond theoretical basics."
3,"Communication Basics, But Wanting More","I included this book as part of my ""readings"" in a quest for personal improvement (for the sake of those I manage). The book was a little too basic and ""touchy - feely"" for me. I would recommend it for those who need the fundamentals skills or want multiple perspectives. If you looking for something more detailed, you might want to keep looking. A suggestion would be to check out Dr. Steven Stowell's bookWin-Win Partnerships: Be on the Leading Edge with Synergistic Coachin. I think he covers everything discussed in this book and takes is a step further. You might also look for something else in the category of communicating skills, giving feedback, or emotional intelligence depending on your specific needs. It won't hurt to have this, but I think you'll want more."
1,"Badly edited fluff, containing nothing.","Full of platitudes, and nothing new. You have been warned. Read all the negative reviews before you buy it. Don't waste your money on this book!"
5,"A fantastic book, a tool for a lifetime","This book was well worth the money, and was full of lessons that previously were expected to be seen by trial and error. The reader in this audio CD was very relatable and friendly....almost like she is a friend by your side teaching you these lessons. It makes for a deep, real form of learning. The contents are almost all real life situations. THIS BOOK WILL SAVE YOU FROM MAKING SOCIAL/LEADERSHIP MISTAKES. These contents will inevitably create a better lifestyle for yourself, and really kick off your career. After all, the only thing stopping us from our dreams and goals is the people that we need to work with on the way."
4,Good Tools for Tough Conversations,"A very good book with lots of specific, helpful tools to help you navigate difficult, emotionally-charged, conversations. I was a little put off by all the cute acronyms summarizing various steps along the way - CRIB, STATE, AMPPP, etc. - but in total agreement with their main points that in order to get people to add to the pool of meaning, you have to help them feel safe.People interested in this topic should also look at the Glaser's book ""Be Quiet, Be Heard"" which covers similar material and presents models that I found are more intuitive and therefore easier to remember."
2,"Seriously, this book is a struggle in concentration","I've based my choice of books many times on fellow reviews and I was let down big time on this one. Normally a book with 4 or 5 stars as the average has some great ideas and it is at the very least, interesting..Well, I found one that isn't. I simply didn't care for the style of the book. It's written by several people and not in an essay format so the style of writing never really reveals a pattern to follow the author's thoughts. It's confusing yet overly simplistic too. I do feel I took away a couple of ideas but not worth the investment of my time."
4,Crucial conversations (CD version),"Great series of CDs, easy-to-listen voice, solid information. Now I'm going to look for a workbook - would be a great tool for family or work-related ""mini-retreat"""
2,I Am Disappointed,"The reviews here led me to believe the book could be a valuable asset to me in my career and overall life. Unfortunately the authors have such a loose grasp of their own message they cannot convey it in any manner except contrived scenarios that are reminiscent of a high school sociology class.I am not saying this to insult the authors or those who find the book useful. I simply expected a higher level of information presented, well, differently. I will keep looking, in the meantime my copy will return to Amazon.com for sale."
2,Very basic common sense!,"I was lead to believe there would be some ground beaking information in this book but it's really just common sense. I think everyone knows, when they're thinking straight, that just being true to yourself, honest, and respectfull of other people while holding to your point of view is the only way to truly get things done. And this is basically all this book says."
4,Crucial Conversations,Wisdom from common life. Organized thoughts and good practices for communication among people.
5,An Outstanding Record of an Incredible Expedition,"These books are a remarkable record of Mike Nichols and Mike Fay's trip across Congo and Gabon. A trip that took them to the deepest reaches of Africa's jungle and in-touch with wildlife and people never previosly recorded by a western expedition.Nicholas photographs offer a candid glimpse at human and animal life inside these incredible countries. Thanks to the efforts of Fay and Nichols, these countries now have national parks that can protect at least some of this land.You can also do your bit, as some of the proceeds of the book's sale go to conservation efforts in Africa."
5,THUG 2,Was Happy to find this game on here!!Reminds me that a game Doesn't need to have realistic graphics to have fun!!
3,What happened?,I love the tony hawk series but with this one they did dissapoint me. The soundtrack is awesome but other then that they did not hook me with this one. The story is kinda lame and alot of the mini games aren't even on skateboards. Thug 1 was cool but I say stick with tony hawk 4 thats the best out of the series.
2,"Though it is not true skateboading, THUG 2 beats THUG by a mile","Ok THUG 2 is a well planned out, well thought out, and just plain fun game. I liked all the hidden characters you could be. I liked some of the crazy moves you could bust out (beaver blasting construction workers was a personal favorite). I liked watching Bam torment fellow skaters with some hillarios jokes. Just admit it, the game is very well done.............if it were a movie game for the movie ""Jackass"". This game was not at all true skateboarding which threw me off (though not entirely, having played the first THUG already) I expected more skateboarding and less idiotic stunts, and whose to say i was pleased? Very dissapointed, though the custom skater mode was top notch. But I expected more out of Neversoft when they pulled out this game, and i can only hope that Tony Hawk American Wastland wont belong in the dusty old garbage bin that the THUG games landed themselves in."
5,Just what I was looking for!,"A friend told me about this album and I decided to visit the website. All I can say is that I've been waiting to hear a band/album like this for a very long time and never thought it would happen! It's really hard to classify the style of New Machine with a label, but that's alright. Powerful songwriting that connects with the heart and at the same time hits you like a two ton heavy thing! This album is full of substance and it's an album that you put on start to finish. No need to skip tracks on this bad boy! The cd has not left my disc player since I got it! Very refreshing. Take a Listen for yourselves. I don't think you'll be disappointed."
5,I have the CD... Wow!!,"Its hard to find such diversity coming from a two person band. Bob and Dave put together an extremely nice piece of art. The entire CD is a great listen. From expert guitar play to the masterful drums, this CD will have you rockin' all the way through."
4,Works well,"Product is a bit glossier than I anticipated, but works very well to cover small scratches. I would recommend it."
5,If you want to walk on water...dvd,This was a good price for the dvd. It arrived in a timely manner and it was in great shape.
2,Good product - Poor Product Description,"Well the quality of these rotors are top notch but too bad the product description is incomplete. In addition the product picture illustrates a set of front rotors but what was received was a set of rears. My recommendation is to state in the product title ""Rear rotors"" and change the associated picture to match the description.Well... now my car is apart, the replacement rotors won't be here for 3 days and you think Amazon would make it right and cover 2nd day delivery because of this issue?... thing again.. Great product but lack-luster customer support from Amazon."
3,Good Tunes But Not the Most Comprehensive Best of,"There are 10 tunes here, all of which made the Billboard 100 singles charts. However, a better CD choice is ""Gary Lewis and The Playboys"" - Legendary Masters Series which has 25 tunes and includes all of the tunes that charted except for ""Rhythm of the Rain"" which only peaked at number 63."
3,Dont even try to evade or block! Just watch Nina bounce,"Yes, it's Nina. Whatever, I found her to be a very annoying character in tekken (I'm an Eddy Gordo man meself). I got the Demo In PSM and amidst the Area 51 and Musashi demos, I played this one the most. Why? Well, I do love the ladies, but I did find it fun to kick ass with the taps, pick up guns and katanas, and bust up goons internally. It reminded me of the Sonny Chiba streetfighter movies. I played through the demo a couple times before I even realized how to use weapons! needless to say, the weapons made my ass kicking efforts more effortless. I would buy the game for $15 bucks or less, but not for 25! It does have major issues with the uselessness of blocking and evading (why put those on the same stick Namco?). Bottom line, $15 yes, anything over NO."
3,"Not bad, but....","It's a decent action game, sure, but it suffers from the (very common) problem of being very fun one moment, and then just frustrating for an equal amount of time, you grit your teeth and keep playing and then it gets good again, and so on. No PS2 game is going to impress graphically today (unless you mean impressive graphics ""for a PS2 game"", like MGS 3 for instance), but Nina looks OK. I think the main problem is that Nina just isn't as interesting as she could have been - neither is the ""story"" of the game. You keep thinking: ""This could have been so much better if only..."". I would recomend this only to fans of guns & girls-games."
5,Almost but not quite,"This Tekken inspired spin-off of Nina Williams is smartly crafted with a combination of action hand2hand combat, special ops missions, & several Tenchu like bone breaking critical moves.Aside from the VERY annoying 180-degree camera shifting you get sometimes when stepping in between camera angles (you're pointing forward and suddenly you're shifting back to the previous angle), the seemingly forever loading time this game can take (it's graphics aren't that sharp), & the less than interesting game plot. Simply put, Namco is on to something but still few enhancements are needed and with minimal improvements this game can be MUCH MUCH more.That said, overall this game has a unique personality very well worthy to experience."
4,Good Actioneer!!!!!,"Take a blend of elements from Onimusha puzzles, Metal Gear gameplay, Resident Evil fixed camera perspectives to an innovative fighting system and you've got DBD. What's best about this game is that it's a solid action title, but what more would you expect from the likes of NAMCO. This game details how exactly Nina Williams and her sister Anna come to the Tekken tournament in Tekken 1. It also gives some background info on the characters through lavish flashbacks. So if you're a fan of Tekken in general or just want a good action title then this might keep you occupied for a while."
2,Not thorough enough,"This book is a good starter identification guide. However, if you want an in depth book with pathology and physiology comments, you'll be dissapointed"
3,more listenable than molly hatchet,"thats about the best endorsement i can give to this. these songs all bring one word to mind: inbred.my original review gave this 2 stars, yet i must rethink my position on this goofy yet suprisingly appealing record. the second half is pretty listenable, with lord have mercy on my soul being a damn fine tune. also, uncle lijah is a keeper, which features the greatest line ever uttered by these greasebuckets: ""he jumped in bed with his ma & pa/& he told em that the devil was in arkansas""-fantastic! if you like raunch & roll, buy this next."
4,Excellent Classic Rock Album,"I saw these guys twice in 1971-early 72, at the university I was going to and also in Buffalo NY. While Jim Mangrum can be an acquired taste, the songwriting on this album is consistently good. Standout tracks are: Uncle Elijah, I Could Love You, Hot And Nasty, Lord Have Mercy On My Soul and the instrumental When Electricity Came To Arkansas (this track rocks!). Great rock and roll album. Take a drive and play this loud! Fun band to see live and for my money they never equaled or passed this first offering. For anyone exploring rock in the 60s and early 70s - this is a nugget you shouldn't pass up."
4,Black Oak,"As far as I am concerned, this was Black Oak Arkansas's best album. Jim Dandy Mangum's voice was at its best, and every song here was well put together. Quirky at times, some of the songs might even be considered novelties, but this was a great album."
3,more listenable than molly hatchet,"thats about the best endorsement i can give to this. these songs all bring one word to mind: inbred. ...... that was my orginal review, and, though i stand by the inbred thing, i've got to give credit where its due. this is, next to raunch n roll, the best thing this band ever did. sure, its oily and rank, but so is a hog on a spit, and people seem to like that. all of the ""second side"" (i'm dating myself: i mean the last 4 songs) are all entertaining, especially the pseudo religious rap at the beginning of lord have mercy on my soul. you could do a whole lot worse than this (e.g.: everclear). to sum up, this album is a grilled pig."
5,BOA,I fell in love with this band in 71 after listening to this album and for me it contains the essence of who they are and where they came from. I still have my original album and can't wait for the CD
5,Simply Amazing,"After returning from a 4-week safari in Eastern Africa, this book was able to provide us with pictures that were certainly unlike anything that we had taken."
3,Somewhat Disappointing,"Having spent time in Africa, I was expecting really spectacular photos, given the promos I had seen and read. My anticipation wasn't rewarded, however. Unique vantagepoints, but compositions could be better, and there is no text to help compensate."
4,Expensive... but worth it.,"I don't normally buy products this expensive, but after trying so many different things to cover the redness around my nose... I just thought what the hell. It works very well. It does not last through my 10 hour work day, but not many products can."
4,Love this product,I had a really hard time trying to find something that would effectively cover my redness from rosacea. I was scared at first when I saw how bright a green it was but it immediately lightened the redness on my skin. The only downside is it only lasts a few hours if used alone but I'm sure with the right foundation the combination would be great.
4,Black and Walker,"Mainly bought this for the Jaid Black story. But was impressed by the Shiloh Walker story. This was my first story by her. Of course since it's a continuation of an established series, I didn't quite know what was going on. But that really didn't matter. It made me want to start on the series. Jaid Black and Lora Leigh are my all time favorites. But now, I have to add Shiloh to this list. Keep up the good work, Shiloh."
4,Great book to learn and explore Indiana,"I thought this book was great. It was very useful. I've spent a good deal of time in Indianapolis, but never really explored many of towns described in the guide book. It even includes day trips to Ohio and Kentucky.The book is divided in to geographical locations, with each area including one to seven day trips.The directions are, for the most part, easy to follow, and the restaurant, shop and hotel listings are informative and as up-to-date as possible.Anyone looking to explore the great state of Indiana, and beyond, I highly recommend this book!"
3,Great songs mediocre backing,"Slightly stiff (sorry, bad pun!) arrangements spoil the great old bawdy songs well sung by the still gorgeous Maria. Dixieland/ragtime in a museum with boaters and striped waistcoats."
5,easy to build and fun,"My kids were fascinated with product, they built it easily and fast and enjoyed playing with it. Looks exactly as it looks in the box, just a little smaller like all Lego toys."
4,Good game for early spellers and readers,"My kids are in grade 2 and grade 4, and they are having a lot of fun with this game. An added benefit is that it works great as a travel/car game. I would actually like to see a few more letters on each side of the board, but it's fine as is for a good challenge. The kids are learning letter combinations and new words, so it's fun and educational. I would recommend it for kids from grade 1-grade 5."
5,EXCELLENT learning game!,"We purchased this neat little game for our (then) four-year-old and seven-year-old daughters. Both daughters are years older now -- and this game is still used with joy! It's great for the living room table, toy-room floor, or in the car on the way to Grandma's house. We've even played it at the park. For a Kindergarten tyke, it's awesome. For older children, it's most excellent. Best of all, it's fun with or without an adult... so you can auto-pilot... or join in on the reindeer games!"
1,Way to Pink,"The product i purchased said orange , the color that you get is pink after you spray it . I will never buy this product again"
5,Merlin Speed contoler failure,"i was given this airplane for a gift, it was my first RC Plane, the plane is a great trainer and very stable in flight. but recently i had a failure with the electronics controling the prop, can anyone tell me where i can get a replacement speed controller for this airplane, none of the hobby shops seem to carry the right type, if i cant get one then i will be forced to completly replace the reciever, batteries, and servos, something that i dont want to have to do, so if anyone knows where i can find a speed controller to replace the one that broke, that would be grateful, contact me at nerdboy_175@hotmail.com"
2,Really small,I normally wear a size 6 and I can't even get this ring on my little finger. The band is very thin. Was disappointed in this purchase.
2,Not very good for beginners,"Well I bought this video and book figuring it would be better (financially) than taking private lessons. I was wrong. Perhaps he's a great teacher for more advanced students but I'm just trying to figure out basic chords and he's moved on after only a few minutes. Granted I stopped the tape, practiced some, and tried to start again but he just seemed a little too advanced for someone with no experiance at all. I guess you can't duplicate that personalized attention with a tape. I suggest if you're buying this to have most of the chords under your belt and, obviously, be very very dedicated to this because it's much harder without a real instructor showing you ""exactly"" what you're doing right and what you're doing wrong."
4,Incredible insite for today from an historical perspective,"This story starts with the sacrifice of Ahaz's son to Molech, and the action continues. Never has the life of Hezekiah been so clearfully depicted. The lessons learned by Hezekiah and his associates are so applicable to today's lifestyles, emphasizing where we are going with our lack of moral fibre. This is a must read for those who think they know the old testament and an eyeopener for those who have never read the Bible. Don't miss the other books in this series! Once you start, you have to read all three! Lynn Austin has truly written a book from the heart and from experience. Her research into her topic is obvious and her love of the Lord is exemplified by her books! Check out her new non-biblical Christian fiction book called ""Fly Away"". If you don't love the characters, you will love the timely topic"
4,The story is so real.,"I just want to say that I am enjoying this series so much, Her characters are so real. Their stories will have you searching into the Bible to check it out. The first book was the hardest to get into and it is excellent! This is a series well worth starting"
2,Thanks for the Memories - I Think ????,"When I lived in California of course The Valley, one of my best friends parent's owned a fruit stand and sold this product. I have moved to another state since then and have been craving these for so many years. I finally found them on this site and could just taste them before the got here. The quantity was great for the price but the taste and texture was very disappointing. They are hard as a rock and really dried out and I was afraid I would chip a tooth if I bit into them. The longer they stay in your mouth the better. This produce tasted old although they do come in a air tight bag. It was not the memory I remember."
2,Outdated,"This book is very outdated. I have been a Radiation Therapist for 7 years and I am currently studying for my Dosimetry boards which I will be taking in several months. Many of my answers to the questions are based on real world experience in the clinical setting. I found many of the answers to these questions to coincide with what I have personally seen and performed.This test question based book was created in 2004; 8 years ago. Many advancements have been made in the world of Radiation Oncology since this time. For this reason, many of the answers are simply outdated.So if you are going to use this book stick to the questions based on things that really haven't changed much in 8 years. Dose calcuations, Isodose Distributions, Brachytherapy, Measurement of Ionizing Radiation; to name a few.Another issue is the format of the quesitons. Too many true/false questions, not enough multiple choice."
5,Delightfully Human,"If you are human and have ever loved, read this book. Read carefully and learn something about yourself, and about those who are not at all like you on the surface. Learn deep down that we all have the same needs, no matter how much we repress them, and love will find a way into your heart whether you want it there or not. And learn that, if you really try, you can be happy."
4,Helps Itching,"I didn't find that this worked very well for my arthritis (severe osteo), but it DOES work wonderfully on mosquito bites, especially if you use it on the bites as soon as you notice them. To me, it's worth it's weight in gold for just that reason. I purchasedAbsorbine Jr Pain Relieving Liquid, Original, with No-Mess Applicator - 4 fl oz, then theAbsorbine Jr Pain Relieving Liquid, Original - 16 fl ozto refill the bottle. I will purchase again next summer when those pesky critters come back.My husband doesn't like the smell, but I don't mind it at all ... and I don't care since it works! :D"
4,Old School,I bought this because I get a stiff neck a lot! It reminded me of my dad and of growing up. He always used this. It really does work for arthritic joints. I am one of those that like the smell but I know not everyone does. My only complaint is that it comes out very fast and will run. This makes the bottle empty quicker then I would like
5,"Victorio, A must.","As an apache woman, this is one book I would highly recommend. Not only does it tell of what The Warm Springs Apache had to endure, but of what they felt and of the internal conflicts amonst the apache people. In this book not only do they focus on Chief Victorio but all that surrounded him.I recommend all to read this book and see what it was like from the Apache point of veiw."
4,Granlund...RELAX,"This book is as good a read as any JFK biography that OMITS his multiple infidelities, and other 'bad' behavior. As the title states...""Recollections of a Warm Springs Apache"" It is not assumed to be an 'unbiased' biography, therefore if we read this it is because we want to know what Kaywaykla has to say not someone named Cremony. This section is for a general review, not for writing our own novels....short and sweet!"
2,Monarch Butterfly on Every Reel?,"My sons have had a lot giggles out of this toy...but at a wasteful cost. It seems as though every reel (Toy Story, Dora, Scooby Doo etc...) all have one frame that comes up with the audio ""Monarch Butterfly!"" This picture is actually on the sample reel that comes with the viewer.They love the idea of watching on the wall, maybe the newer disks will be better bar coded."
3,Super Sounds Projector,"We had high hopes for this product and were left with a ""so-so"" feeling about it. The actual projection on the wall is very small. We bought the SpongeBob, Cars and Dinosaurs catridges to go with it, and although they do make noise, they dont have any kind of dialogue or tell any kind of story. Just sound effects for each frame which turn out to be pretty boring. It is an easy toy to operate though. My 5 year old does it by herself."
4,A Big Hit,We purchased this projector for our 3 year old based on other reviews on Amazon.We have been very pleased.It is easy for my little guy to operate and he loves it.The remote is very cool because he can lie in bed and do a little slide show for himself. I like the automatic advance and appreciate the fact that it shuts off after awhile of no usage. The other reviewers were correct in stating that the sound is a little lame but that's no big deal really.
1,missing alot of detail....,"Wow, I am really suprised this book garnered as much positive feedback as it has. I am a nursing major, and I was apalled at the lack of detail in this book. I ended up using the A&P text from my 201 class for the majority of this class. Maybe it was the questions my instructor asked, but I constanatly had to go to other sources in order to find the information I needed. If anyone finds themself in this situation, Ken Saladin's text by the same name is the best!!!"
5,Written to be Understood,I am in my second semester using Elaine N. Marieb's Human Anatomy & Physiology book. She has a great ability to take a very complicated subject and break it down so that it can be learned not just memorized. She doesn't skip the details that are important to learn . She makes it more understandable. This book will be a great reference for years to come.
4,Great price for the book,It worked out great. We're using this to study for a science event and it came in handy. The price was great too.
5,great book,this book is very helpful in filling the gap between planning a practice and seeing the patients. there is much explained on everything from fixtures to negotiating a lease.
4,"Good book, excellent subject, but still ...","Compass takes us back to the day when compasses were not understood, performed poorly, broke, were inconsistent, and often pointed many, many degrees from North.Yet it was all early mariners had.Alan tell the story of the development of the compass, particularly the marine compass, from the days of a magnitized piece of steel floating in a bowl of water to today's current marvel, with multiple magnets used to avoid sorts of errors like semicircular deviation and heeling error.Unfortunately, it is not equal to Dava Sobel's great book on Finding the Longitude. The information seems scarcer, and the writing is not quite as good. It is amazing to learn that almost 1,000 years had to pass before most if not all the errors of a compass were figured out and coorrected, Still highly recommnendedIf you navigate, you should have this book to learn the complexity of the compass in your vehicle."
2,Disappointing,"This is little more than a vapid textbook which fails to awaken any love and interest in the history initiate and is too summary in spite of its 670 pages to gain any knowledge or understanding deep rooted enough to remain in one's memory a few months after reading. Read Herodotus, Tuchydides, Gibbon, Braudel, Hobsbawm instead."
1,Pass the Cliff's Notes!,"A number of my fellow college students and I have found this book to excrutiatingly slow, heavy reading. The average student will spend several hours reading Roberts, only to note with dismay that he/she has only covered one or two chapters. This book contains a wealth of information, but this does not redeem its wet-cement reading consistency. My rating of one star is too generous for Roberts' History of Europe."
5,"Excellent, I felt that I was in the audience with Peabo!!!",This video is really great. For all of the Peabo Bryson Fans it is worth the wait . He sings a lot of the oldies but goodies that made him so great. Welcome back Peabo!!!
3,"Quite a nice little book, but you are left wanting for more","This book is quite a fascinating look at the roles women have played in the British Navy before this century. However, there does seem to be a lack of in-depth study of the women profiled. I found myself wanting to know much more than the author was willing to offer me. I felt too much time was taken re-iterating the social and economic standpoint of prostitutes in this era rather than focusing on the women's contributions to the Royal British Navy. I was mildly insulted when Ms. Stark suggested the reason these women were willing to be ""transvestites,"" or dress as men to serve onboard naval vessels, was basically Freud's ""penis envy"" theory. This book did sharpen my appetite to find more books on the subject of Women in the Maritime Military."
3,Interesting Light on Women's History,"This book would be well read in combination with Joan Druett's Hen Frigates: Wives of Merchant Captains Under Sail. Stark's book focuses on the lives of prostitutes in English port towns, on sailor's wives and widows ashore, and those who sailed with their husbands, and briefly on the experiences of women who sailed disguised as men.The author does a good job of portraying the limited options available to English women during the Napoleonic era, and explains why women might find it necessary to engage in prostitution, follow their husbands to sea, or serve disguised as men. The author takes pain to debunk the then-popular myth of disguised women sailors searching for lost husbands or brothers.The book was, in some respects, too brief a discussion of the topic. A more in-depth analysis would be welcome."
4,good caddy,This holds a variety of hand tools for yard work. Easy to carry and keep handy. Appears to be quite sturdy so should stand up to lots of use.
3,The Clear Liquid Silk,"Great for flying solo, but gets tacky for long sessions. Prefer the white version"
3,slippery when wet,"Its not my favorite ""personal lubricant"" It seems to get a strange texture and tends to dry out fairly quick. I do like the thickness of it, it doesn&#699;t get all over the place, just where you put it. Another thing is that it makes my hands all wrinkled, like I&#699;ve spent an hour in the pool. If it&#699;s doing that to my hands, whats it doing to...well, ya know?!"
1,The Title is Misleading!,"It was all I could do to make it through this book! I was under the mistaken impression that it would get to the heart of the author's eating disorder. There were too many religious quotes in the book. I am a practicing Catholic, but this was a little like reading a Sunday sermon! I wanted to know what she thought, how she felt, what caused her to do this, etc. Instead, it was full of references about ""how your body is a temple."" I would never recommend this book to anyone who may be really interested in reading about eating disorders."
3,Not What I Thought...,"This book is not for those turned off by having religion thrown in your face.I bought this book in the hopes that there was someone else out there I could relate to in my eating disorder struggle. Instead, I found a book where being anorexic is constantly labeled a ""sin"", and I was reminded over and over again how ""bad"" I am for being anorexic, and how much I disappoint 'God' by being this way.Nearly every entry in this book (written in diary format) makes a reference to God, religion or Bible verses. I'm not against religion by all means, but I was not expecting this.A better choice of reading would be Slim to None: A Journey through the Wastelands of Anorexia Treatment by Jennifer Hendricks."
4,pretty sweet,"i only bought this album because of adam weiss from mewithoutyou. listen to 70X7, that is an amazing song.the rest of the songs i could care less for. the effects on the CD are interesting though so i give it credit for being different and not your normal 'rap' or 'hip hop'.worth it."
3,mwY-- hip hop style?,"...well, kind of.some of the members of bella futuro are part of an outfit now known as mewithoutYou. the best way to describe this is basically indie hip hop with a rough feel to it. nothing amazing or life changing, but it's still cool to listen to a band that has changed quite a bit and are now known as mewithoutYou.best track is the fourth one, with aaron weiss of mwY on guest vocals."
1,Can't play it on U.S. DVD player!,"I didn't know anything about region codes. This DVD cannot be played in the U.S. or Canada! I contacted the seller and they sent me a return label. As soon as they received it back, they promptly gave me a refund.I then ordered The Doors Collection which contains Hollywood Bowl among other video. That one is coded for play in the U.S. (Region 1). So if you are thinking of purchasing, buy the Doors Collection instead of this one unless you live in another country."
3,It Blew My Mind,"I was there.... July 1968 in the Hollywood Bowl. What a show!!! When I watch this video in retrospect, I'm unsure why I was so enraptured. I'm a lot older today, my musical tastes have changed. However, it is part of my history and music's as well. This is a very fine show for the younger generation to understand what it was like in 1968. People are strange, indeed."
4,very cool ship,"I was a little worried that this alien ship wouldn't be quite cool enough for my son's ""main toy"" at Christmas, but even though it is not as big as some of the other ships, it is bigger than I thought it would be, and definitely a great value. Awesome set for the price. He put it together fairly quickly with his 9-year-old Lego expertise, and has had fun flying it around. The construction project was not too much to keep his attention until completion, but enough to be a fun challenge. His 3-year-old brother has fun stealing aliens whenever he can sneak past the closely guarded base. Overall, I was quite impressed with the sleek ship design, moving parts that don't fall off too easily, and ""action value""--it is a fun set to play with. Well worth it."
4,Good Read,The book is a little slow but keeps your interest. If you liked vol. 1 you'l like vol two it is a little better but still seting things up.
3,Just enough punch to be worth it,"Picked this one up at random, but after slogging through about a quarter of the book realizing how long it's been since I really kept up with the X-Men and how few of the active characters I know, it was worthwhile.The first half's storyline, dealing with the titular problem, starts rough but ends well. The last panel pretty much defines the X-books from the first issue through today, and it really put a smile on my face.The second half is really the gem here, a slight twist on the (too)oft-repeated X theme of a dystopian future. By itself, this would have been a 4-star review."
1,"Dull, disappointing","The movie was rather dull. The cyclists cover the most general, touristy aspects of Alaska and don't delve into the true wonders of the state. The ride itself isn't terribly impressive -- the cyclists cover about 50 miles a day, which doesn't test the physical limits of humans like, say, Ride the Divide.As a person that loves Alaska and loves endurance events, I was very disappointed."
3,Poor pouring!!,"First the good news. It really can keep hot water for a day! Amazing.The bad news are it's almost imposible to pour water in small cups without weting the table or your legs or everything underneath!!! If you want it for drink ''mate'' (eg. argentina, uruguay, paraguay, etc) don't buy this thermus. I used to have an Aladdin thermus and it pouring was perfect. Please, if someone knows how to make it work ok please let me know!!"
2,Good if you don't like hot coffee,"Nope. You cannot rely on anything metal to be outside in cool weather to keep anything hot for long. When the outer shell cools where do you think that coolness is going to permeate. The inner shell. Your once piping hot coffee will be cooled in about two hours.I use thus on beach. In 90 degree weather. As said, within about two hours my coffee didn't even steam. I hope Thermos doesn't stop making the glass models. Coffee stays hot for about 18 hours in those."
3,Funky Smell,"I use this thermos for bringing milk to work and the cap has begun to smell funky. I wash it and scrape it like crazy and it still smells odd. Not like bad milk, just not like plastic.Still, it keeps my milk cold and I ignore the smell while I drink it cuz the milk tastes fine. Just bothers me a little that the cap smells odd."
3,rather umm large...,"and clumsy. not sure why i orderd this! LOL its sitting in my kitchen unused--well i used it a few times and decided to just get a french press. i originally bought it to take coffee to work. then i figured i am too much of a coffee snob to sip from this bad boy all day. so french press it was! yes its rugged, and its pretty nice. but...no real use for it now. guess i will save it for a trip."
3,Rated in the middle,I would rate it in the middle. Not as good as my old Stanley thermos. It survied me well over the years. Should have went back to it.
5,Great thermos,I chose Thermos brand since it's been around for so long. We needed a tough thermos that could withstand bumps and drops. This one is holding up great. It keeps coffee hot all night long so it's ready for you in the morning. It really helps to rinse it with hot water first before putting in the hot coffee!
5,Awesome thermos,Bought this or my boyfriend as an Xmas gift. He is a truck driver and he loves it. Really does keep stuff warm for a very long time.
1,Defective,"Like a previous reviewer I got a defective product. As soon as I filled the bottle with hot coffee the entire container became hot. Four hours later my coffee was cold. Not just cool, but cold. There must have been a hole somewhere in the outer shell because there was absolutely no insulating effect provided. The cap also sat slightly at an angle so even if the bottle had been intact I question its ability to work properly. You would think a company as well-known as Thermos would have flawless quality control but apparently not."
1,Great at first... now terrible,When I first got this thermos.. it worked great ... kept hot coffee for a day. But after a few months.. now does not keep hot for 2 hours. I am thinking it lost the vacuum seal. It has not been dropped or damaged.
2,Not exactly as described.,"Returning this gift. It states in the description that it has a stainless steel cup. I wanted that so my hot liquids would not be touching plastic. Well the cup is stainless steel on the outside, but completely plastic on the inside. No thanks! My mom's cat and our dogs form blisters when they eat or drink out of plastic bowls so we switched to metal and glass and those blisters went away. If our animals react to plastics this way I certainly don't want my hot liquids and food in a plastic cup. Will keep searching for a higher quality product.Update: Found a true stainless steel insulated container for my hot liquids. Unfortunately I can only purchase from Amazon Canada which I plan on doing. The product title is: Purica - Stainless Steel Insulated Beverage Water BottleLocated here: http://www.amazon.ca/Purica-Stainless-Insulated-Bouteille-Inoxydable/dp/B0064CO9ZK"
2,Franny and Zooey--fooey!,What strikes you about this book the most is why was it written at all? It's not at all like Franny and Zooey. It is not even a good Thelma and Louise. Maybe the Osbourne kids taking a long endless ride. Give me a break! The sixties and seventies were definitely more interesting than this!
5,Only the BEST shoes EVER!,I run about 3 miles but I have knee/hip problems on top of my flat feet so I am very VERY picky when it comes to running shoes. These are by far the best running shoes ever! These are true to size and have the best cushion. I am not crazy about a lot of the color combos but it's the cushion that sold me. The cushion will wear out depending how much you run & mine wore out after about a year.
5,Great Adventure for Kids,"This book was a huge hit with my 3-1/2 year old nephew. He loved guessing what animal was coming up on each page, and when I would start reading him the descriptions of the animals, he'd add his own, too, like...Snakes, ""...and they creep!""Elephants, ""...and they spray water!""Monkeys, ""...and they say `oooooh oooooh eeeee aaaaaah aaaaaah aaaaah'""He asked me to read it to him 4 times in the first night!"
5,On Our Second Copy,"We got this in paperback for my older son a year ago, and the book immediately received a lot of love. For a true animal head, it's tough to get much better. The writing is whimsical and clever, and the pictures are gorgeous. Although he's long since ""guessed"" which animals are next, he still likes to pretend to guess every time we read. The original book showed enough wear and tear from toddler reading that we just got another one, this time in hard cover. But the paperback will still come in handy--as our one-year-old takes up reading...."
5,great tape,"I bought this for my friend, Ruth. She wanted a tape of Dorothy Kirsten because she was in The Great Caruso with Mario Lanza. She loves it."
4,Great sound for the price,"These in-ear phones sound excellent, especially considering the price. At home, I listen to music with my open-back grado sr-125's (150 dollar cans) and I would say that these sound almost as nice (low end is a bit exaggerated, and mids aren't that crisp). That being said, I assume everyone uses these with a portable device and mid to low bitrate mp3s, and they are excellent in this regard. I also find them quite comfortable, and the uneven length wire is nothing unusual. I can't remember buying a pair of earbuds in the past 3 years that didn't have this feature. I'm not the biggest fan of the thin rubber wire which one reviewer already pointed out, tends to grab on to clothes. Not a big deal. I had a similarly priced pair of in-ear Sony Fontopia earbuds which I absolutely loved (but unfortunately lost), and decided to give these a shot. I don't regret it...a very quality product as I would expect a company like Denon to put out."
2,Buy something else for the same price. Bad product.,"Ok, let me first start by saying I have owned 20+ set's of headphones or earphones over the last 10 years. I listen 4+ hours a day to them so I have a little more than average experience with this stuff. In a nutshell, these are a waste of money. The sound is very tubular. The midrange seems to be to high in comparison the the bass and treble. I have a custom EQ and I know what I am doing so don't think that I had my settings wrong. They simply do not live up to the Denon name. I think the engineer that created this product and put the Denon name on it needs to be fired. I was highly dissappointed. I paid $49.00 for these and it was a waste. I took these back to the store after 3 days. Buy the Zune version 2 for $39.00 and you will be much more pleased."
2,not the best f1 game,"i was hoping this game would be better than it was , i have played f1 games on the psx-1 that were better, maybe they did not look as good , but the car physics were a lot better, the gran prix cars on gran turismo 3 make these cars look bad, i hope EA sports do a better job on the next f1 game they produce, i took a chance on this game and i am dissapointed,"
2,More disappointing the more you play,"If you are expecting the driving physics of GT3, you are up for a big disappointment.If you are a F1 fanatic itching for something decent after months of waiting, then it could be worth your money... as long as you stick to dry races. Cars are impossible to control in the wet. Other negatives: weather changes every couple of laps, opponents don't change tires, pit sends wrong messages on your radio, etc."
5,mind-blowing,"This version of EA Sports' Formula One Championship game for PS 2 is leagues and leagues over last year's! The grafics are absolutely mind-blowing, and also the performance of the cars has improved quite a bit. I am not sure if the game just brillintly simulates the real-life re-introduction of traction control systems, but the cars handle very differently from last year's game. This is still not a totally easy game to play, and I definitely recommend that you get a steering wheel and foot-pedal set insatead of the regular game controllers, but it is very much worth it. If you follow the Formula One season, driving this game will give you completely new insights into the different tracks and the performance differences of the various contending cars and teams. It will definitely enhance your enjoyment of the TV broadcasts. So while the F1 off-season is still on - get behind the wheel and practice the Melbourne track before the season-opener rolls around"
4,Getting Better,"The game is a huge improvemnet over last years half baked effort. It's not perfect (yet) but it is by far the best one on the market. The AI could be better and the handling a litte more realistic. Normal mode being too easy, and Simulation a bit on the difficult side. Normal mode has no setup options and Sim mode almost too many. Graphics are great with track layouts and attention to detail superb. If nothing else it puts us one step closer to a truly great game next year.....assuming they fix the few short comings of this one. If you love Formula 1, have a go. You won't be dissapointed"
4,Fabulous orange bavarian torte!,"Worth it just for the orange bavarian torte recipe. This is one of Julia's most delicious deserts, and makes a stunning presentation. The book (and Julia Child and Company) has excellent color photographs which show you step-by-step how to assemble each recipe. These books are organized by complete menus which is helpful if you are planning an event."
1,Amy needs to take a happy pill...,"This book was a disappointment. Having bought other F-P titles for my toddler, I was expecting an upbeat and imaginative story. Instead, the book is about a little girl who says ""no"" to everything; this is the very behavior that I DON'T want to reinforce!"
4,Old Romantic Spanish Music,"I bought this CD for my family who love very old world spanish music, and put these tunes on my mothers MP3 - she loved it! When she needs new music, will definitely shop at Amazon for more slow Bolero music. Thanks!"
3,Gina,"Well, the song is catchy, but thats about it. I am almost positive thats Armand Van Helden in the video. But he gets no credit?"
2,What a horrible video!,"There isn't much to say about this video, its just plain horrible. I found the uncut version to be so pointless, I thought Madonna was supposed to be done with those days. The sound quality in the video is also bad, the album itself proves to be much better. Don't buy the video single, just buy the album."
1,Justify My Spending,"Way to go Kev. The man knows his s**t. I dig Madonna, but she gets a lot of credit where it isn't due. If anyone is a pioneer it is definitely Bjork. Even Madonna copped her ""Bedtime Story"" song. Bjork's video was much, much better and very provacative. Madonna was an innovator a long time ago, now she just uses the best person in the current ""thing"" and takes all the credit for breaking new ground as a major artist. That's why most up and coming artists don't want to work with her. I have to hand it to Madonna though, she still knows how to sell herself."
1,Awful!,"Please! True Madonna fans wouldn't want to see this junk. I saw this video on VH1 one time, and that is enough. I thought the beginning was pretty cool, but near the end, that's when it goes downhill -- strippers dressed in thongs that may be grossing out our TV viewers, or better yet, putting marriages on the rocks (or so I think). Why would VH1 allow this junk on the air?! Hollywood, you're starting to make us nervous."
4,Nice Piece. Mediocre DVD,"As a DVD single, this one offers very little more than the Music video. There is one alternate version, slightly different than the standard one, and nothing else.Video quality is good and audio quality is also good. Multichannel audio would have been great, but Madonna doesn't seem to care about it... yet."
2,not worth the money,I bought this thing from an Amazon affiliate. It takes forever to tune my guitar with it. Hitting the same string over and over you get a different result each time only seconds later. It is very frustrating to use and I would rather just tune my guitar by ear. I would like to return it but it is an affiliate of Amazon and you can't get a return label. You have to email the store and request an authorization code and pay for your own shipping return. By the time I do all of that and waist my time dropping it off at UPS - well it's not worth it. I'm extremely disappointed in Amazon that this item is difficult to return. I will think twice next time I buy from an affiliate of Amazon.
4,chromatic tuner,"Purchased two Sabines at a fantastic price. This tuner has some of the best qualities: digital, dual power, 9volt or A/C and also has 1/4"" inlet/outlets. Tune my ukes at least twice a day while practicing. I highly recommend Sbine STX1100!"
4,Totaly Reliable,"I have owned this tuner for almost 10 years and have found it a completely reliable piece of gear. It's been very handy in the studio, practice space, and guitar case and is easy to use, small and durable. The power saver feature has saved my life numerous times. If you accidentally leave the tuner on, it will eventually shut itself off and remind you when you go to use it again. I've used it on guitar, banjo, ukulele, mandolin and just about any other stringed instrument I've come across. I wish everyone in my band had one!"
2,Not sure if this works yet...,"I bought this for my alto sax playing. A friend of mine has the smaller, probably older version of this device. Hers does not come with the manual transpose feature.When I play a note, her tuner indicates that my note is correct, every time. We placed my new device next to hers, and the two do not agree. This new one does never seem to find the note played. Also, I am not sure if the transpose works correctly, we both tried to follow the instructions, and the result seems rather random each time...I'll take it to my local music store to let the guys there take a look, but I suspect something is wrong with it...Once I figure it out, I'll make an addition to this review then, one way or the other!"
4,Chromatic Auto Tuner,I like the way the tuner clamps to the music stand and its accurate tuning. Its size makes it easy to pack and transport.
5,a wise investment,"pearls of wisdom, along with some tried-and-true tips that come as no surprise, make this book a wise investment. some good writing to boot!"
4,Good Ideas,"Although I have'nt read the entire book it did have great ideas on how to save a lot on items such as furniture, carpeting, and clothing. Some ideas that the book has I already knew, but the rest were well worth the cost of the book."
4,Fun treehouse for all,"I purchased this treehouse for my twin 3 year old sons for Christmas. They love it. My 5 year old daughter loves it too. They all use it in various ways to play w/ their figures or barbies. The only negative thing we experienced is that the one door on the bottom split when the kids removed it. Otherwise, a great purchase."
5,Great Toy!,This tree house is wonderful! My 4 year old daughter and I are always having to use the pulley system to hoist barrels of pickles up to the hungry people in the upper decks. We bought another tree and the bridge that goes between them but I think the chair lift and gondola would be more fun. I will purchase those in the future. I have orderred Disney's A Swiss Family Robenson movie to give us more ideas for play themes. That might lead to buying Maxim's pirate ship which looks equally enchanting. It was no hardship to put this toy in our living room because it is almost like a piece of art (only a slight exageration) with an organic feel.
4,"Good toy, not durable","I love the concept of this toy. I bought this for my 2 1/2 year old son. He has spent alot of time playing with it. My biggest complaint about it is its durability. The foot has come off one of the people, the leaves come off the braches easily, the walls that cover the bottom floor are edged with felt that easily comes unglued with repeated movement. The reason I had to put this toy away was that the roof is held in place by little wooden pegs that are placed into predrilled holes. These pegs easily come out and the whoel upper fence/roof becomes wobbly and falls off. Then the 8 pegs are left strewn about the floor to become a choking hazard for my 9month old. I had to put this toy away until everyone in the house is much older to be able to play with toys cautiously."
4,TreeHouse,Will be giving this to my grandkids. I put it togetter and instructions were very god. Can't wait to give it to them.
3,Christmas Disaster,"We bought this toy for our daughters for Christmas and it did not even make it to them on Christmas morning before it started to fall apart. During assembly, two of the three nuts that are used to connect the parts of tree trunk together broke into multiple pieces. Just to give it to my daughters on Christmas morning, I spent several hours in the garage making my own repairs. The third nut only last for about two hours worth of play on Christmas morning before it broke into three pieces. Now I am stuck trying to find an unique nut so that I can put the toy back together after just a couple of hours of play. Maybe this was just a manufacturing problem with the batch of nuts included in the toy but I would not take a chance on another toy from this manufacturer."
4,My kids love it,"My kids love and still play with it on and off, 7 months after they got it. The construction quality is pretty good. Every now and then you need to go over it, and tighten all the screws again, but that's probably because my kids keep moving it around."
1,DONT BUY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,... YOU FLY IT FOR LIKE 10 SECONDS AND IT FALLS RIGHT BACK DOWN! BUT IT IS EDUCATIONAL! IT TEACHES YOU WHAT NOT TO BUY ...
1,RUN AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT LIKE THE PLAGUE!,"UP IN THE AIR FOR 15 SECONDS, LANDS AND BREAKS IN TWO.PIECE OF GARBAGE"
4,Questions,"I am under 13 years old. I want to know if the item is almost 5 pounds because it is made of plastic or just the parts are heavy. I really want to get this toy. I also wanted to know how fast this item can go at top speed, and if while you are turning if you can go up or down. Sorry that I didn't put the sentences together but this is the last question, I want to know how high it can go. This is all I want to know."
1,"A MEGA CRASH PLANE, PIECE OF JUNK","the battery is located towards the front, throwing the plane's balance unequal, this plane is prone to nose dives lost mine over a pond... ..."
2,I recieved this used not brand new,"I bought this safe approximately two weeks ago with one day shipping. It was supposed to be brand new but it came in as used. I noticed scratch marks at the key section of the safe. I kept the safe due to the fact I have bought a couple of handguns. It is a great safe for what I am using it for. Easy instructions on how to use the digital combinations. I have no problem with the safe and it works really well at this moment. However, there are instructions on how to break into particular digital safe on youtube and I tried it myself and it did not work, maybe I'm not a great burglar. In conclusion, it is a great safe for keeping handguns or important documents safe. I a m satisfied with it but not with the condition I received it. I got the safe for 70 dollars and it was 20 dollar cheaper than walmart."
4,As expected,"The safe arrived packed well. The setup was easy, but do read the directions close. to program you have to press the # button, but to open, its the * button!Its a little smaller than i expected, but does what i needed."
5,Great little safe,I purchased this safe to keep my handguns in as well as some other things like jewelry etc. It functions as advertised and has been a great investment. Opening it is a breeze and it has been nearly a year on the same batteries with no issues. It is opened daily and I have not had any issues with it. I would recommend it to a friend for sure.
5,Great safe,"Great personal safe, easy to access, It is good for home defence hand gun storage. you can put up to 4 hand guns inside. Some bad news for me is now the price goes down from $69.99 to $60.If you need it. Maybe it is the good time to buy it now."
1,PLEASE DONT BUY,"If you are thinking of using this safe as gun safe DONT. Dont. dont. My 12 year old brother showed me yesterday, over and over again, how easy it was to pick the lock on the safe. 12 year old kids are exactly what a gun safe is supposed to protect against!! He breaks in at will and usually within 1o seconds. He is not a locksmith or a professional burglar....he is a twelve year old kid with a fish hook."
4,Not bad for a little safe,"I checked this out at the store before I bought it. So, I knew how big it was. The beeping is mutable...which was a must for me. It's a bit small...but it's a good safe for one or two pistols. It's very easy to re-set the pin if you need to do so. I'd buy it again if I needed a small safe."
2,Locking mechanism defective on mine..,I received mine from Amazon and the locking mechanism was defective. It would open maybe 1 out of 20 times. I would enter the code and the light would turn green but when I turn the knob nothing. If I kept trying maybe after 20 times it would open.Of course Amazon gave me a full refund. I'll be replacing it with a SentrySafe unit of which I already have that works much better and is a lot smoother.
4,Good solid safe,Solid safe it holds a few pistols . Bolt it in a stud in the wall and it would be a good deterrent for a theif with out a lot of time. Must bolt it down or someone will walk off with it. I use it for one pistol for fast access .
4,Great for the price,"I needed to put my guns up and the combination is nice for easy access if I need it in a hurry, as I don't always know where my keys are."
1,"Lost 3500$ of guns and valuables to this ""safe""","I actually liked this ""safe"" until it was broken into while I was not home.I came home and found the safe, pried open with a simple flathead screwdriver which was lying next to the safe. My Sig Sauer P229 was gone. You can see in the inside of the safe door that the box housing the deadbolts simply pried away from the front door. I will refer to the companies website that says exactly this: ""Solid steel, pry resistant door has concealed hinges and 2 steel live action locking bolts."" Pry resistant? A simple cheap flathead screwdriver defeated this so called safe.Don't make the same mistake I did. This safe is no more secure than a cardboard box to an adult with a screwdriver."
1,Defective on arrival,"Unlocked safe with key, installed batteries, pressed the inside red button and entered a code. All went fine so I reentered code followed by the star key and was able to turn and unlock the door. Great! .. except for the humming sound I heard from the door. Over the next 10 test attempts it unlocked only twice and then the humming stopped. At this point I made a number of other attempts which all failed. I changed out the batteries with new fresh batteries, reset the code and still it wouldn't unlock. Inserted & turned the key and when turning the dial it was very stiff with quite a bit of resistance. I'm guessing there is an issue with the internal Solenoid.Returned and looking for something that's more reliable.I also purchased the smaller Stack-On PDS-500 Drawer Safe which is working just fine.. for now. Items stored in this do not require quick access so I'll likely keep it and hopefully it continues to work fine. If not I have the keys. We'll see how it goes."
4,Great safe!,Works like a charm. The only down side is I had to view a You Tube video to see how to work the safe to open it. But it works great and hides well in my closet on the floor. I like this safe a lot. It's sleek and cool!
5,Good Value,"I like this save. Tough, solid, the keypad works great, and can be silenced, which is great if you're storing your gun for emergencies. Key option and low battery indicator included which is great. Includes keys.Note about size: This safe could fit multiple handguns. Maybe four with the shelf in in, or two without. If you pile them up, you could probably fit eight, but I wouldn't. The only problem is you can't fit an average sized gun (like a Glock 19) in it unless you point the barrel straight in, or straight to the side. If it's diagonal, it won't fit, so you'll need a deeper one if you want more options."
2,Ok for the money I guess.. keypad not reliable,"Well, for the price I can't complain about the quality. It's fairly sturdy. The front casing (silver part shown) is all plastic, which I'm really not a big fan of. And most of the time I have to key in the combination three or four times before the lock will disengage. Definitely means I don't leave it locked at night if I fear I might NEED to get to my guns. I've learned to open it at night when I go to bed because I can't depend on quick access in an emergency. Then I lock it during the day to keep the kids and guests out of it.If there are other options for your money, I'd suggest one of those. I won't bother returning it but I won't recommend it to anyone else either though..."
3,Ok safe for the money.,I purchased this safe for my handguns. It is big enough to hold several full size pistols. Easy operation. Shipped with minimal documentation. Corner and door already scratched. But I am not plan to return it for a exchange.
3,Secure but...,"This safe seems secure enough. I don't like that the number buttons make a loud beeping noise when you put in your combination. If you were using it to store a gun, everyone would know what you were up to. Likewise, there is no way to put in the combination in the dark with any speed."
4,Best wall safe for the money,"great product, good quality for the money! I mounted it in a wall between 2 studs and its solid as a rock, would take some work to get it out and time, even if they found it in the first place!"
5,Stack on safe,This safe is awesome. And such a good deal. I saw it elsewhere for double the price. It works great. And hold a lot of stuff. I highly recommend this safe.
5,VELLS,"One of those EP's you can't take out of the player. Here is a refreshing mix of well-written tunes with a retro feel of the British pop invasion. I especially like the tunes ""gun for gun"" and ""the very scary trees"". The lead vocals are fresh with a unique style that sets them apart from the typical independent bands. I can't wait to hear more from the Vells!!"
5,Awesome photography,My daughter saw this book in my doctor's office and told me about it. So glad I ordered it. Very inspirational.
5,A wonderful Biography,A very well-written biography of Crittenden and a good chronicle of the events that led up to the Civil War. Highly critical of the refusal of Abraham Lincoln to compromise and thus avoid a bloody war.
5,great music!,"very impressed with this new group. great sound, fresh and new. Great lyrics and reminiscent of the great rock and roll sound, with a twist."
1,Had to send it back,"First off the AM/FM tuner is awful. I get better reception on a transistor radio. The speaker system was very tinny also. I could have lived with that since the LCD seemed to work very well at first. After one day, the TV would shut down after a few minutes of playing. It would require unplugging to get the system to start working again. Again after a few minutes it would shut down.I traded it in for the SONY."
1,Do Not Buy!,"When our Polaroid 7 in TV went out in July 2006, (purchased in December, 2005), we followed the trouble shooting per Polaroid and was told for $110 we could receive a refurbished model...Sleeping on that, the next day, my parents Polaroid 7 in TV went out in the same manner (also purchased December 2005)...Now 2 tv's in 2 days?? NO COININCIDENCE Polaroid...When my parents called they got the same song and dance, and inquired about a recall. Polaroid said there weren't enough reported problems to warrant a recall. This is a piece of junk.."
1,Don't Buy!!,"I recieved this item for Christmas, was installed on Dec. 25 2005, today is the 6th of June '06. It quit working yesterday, not even 6 months old. The warranty is only for 90 days! they offered me another warranty for 90 more days for $110. So I'm not buying any Polaroid product."
4,Good unit for what it is...,"I purchased this unit for a replacement of a bulky 13"" in my home office to have something on while working with the computer. Unlike other reviewers I think the sound is fine for the 5w speaker system. The resolution is just ok. There is little or no sheilding on the electronics so is will pick up interference from other appliances (the fridge, microwave, flourecent lights, etc.) however, the manual reads that it should be placed away from these appliances. I haven't used the radio so I can't spaek to it. It definitely serves the need I had for it and the price was 100 dollars less than next brand. So I'm content with the purchase overall."
3,No problems with my FCM-0700A,This all in one machine is as I would expect. Working in the video world - the mandatory 16:9 is survivable - it is used for what it was intended - flip down in the kitchen while working or cooking. My machine has been feeding the kids Disney Channel off the cable - or the weather channel for us reliably for almost a year with no issues. Maybe the SONY is a better cheaper and better sounding machine... but next to the stove and under the microwave... who cares?
1,Not working after 5 months!,I purchased this product in March and it was no longer operative by August of 2006. I called the support center and they informed me to get a replacement I would have to pay to ship it back and then pay $60 for a replacement! I can't believe technology today. Are we such a disposable society now that our electronics are only gonna work for 6 months or less? Come on people we need to protest the substandards we are being subjected to since there is no longer any person that actually cares!!
1,Agree with all posted reviews.,I agree with all reviews complaining that the equipment fails after about six months. Polaroid should be doing something.
2,FCM-0700A should be called FCM-1YEAR,"I do not recommend this unit. It lasted barely a year and then kaput. The CSR said that the warranty was only good for one year after purchase. Now I see why. This will last just that long and then die. Even in warranty, you have to pay for shipping the unit to the factory only to have it replaced IF they have it in stock. Otherwise you will end up waiting till it is... oh, but if you call and complain, then maybe a manager can replace it with a newer one... but only after you have waited for over a month with no DVD player at all.The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because it lasted a year. If it wasn't for that, then it would have only received one."
1,Don't buy this product!!,"We bought this product and installed it in January 2005. After several months we would occasionally turn it on and the TV screen would be grey. Eventually we'd get it to work correctly. Now in July 2005, we have no TV image at all. This set is hooked directedly to a cable TV outlet. When I called Polaroid, they told me it has only a 90 day warranty but they'll exchange it for a mere $160. So basically I am out my $250 and now they want another $160 to replace it.Don't buy this product!!!"
1,If I could give it 0 stars I would,"I absolutely loved this TV for my kitchen. Didn't care if it sounded tinny it served the purpose. However after 3 and a half months, the screen stopped working. We contacted the seller on Amazon and were told it had a THREE month warranty and it was no longer under warranty. Pretty expensive TV for three months. DO NOT BUY THIS TV!"
3,Necron Codex,A now out of date codex for the necron army. Its a short rule book with not a whole lot of pictures and flavor text.
5,"The Passionate Mind, by Joel Kramer","After reading Krishnamurti's ""Freedom from the Known"", I was referred to this book by someone who was conversant with both. Both are excellent, yet I found this more direct and easy to read for day to day reference of the salient points covered in both books. I consider it a must for spiritual seekers looking for, what could be, the final ""integrative"" tools to use in the self-God realization process."
1,can't tell any improvement,Purchased for my mother who had a fingernail mostly removed -this was suggested by the dr. who removed it -we cant tell any difference or improvement after nearly a month of use.
3,Good product but lousy packaging,"I found that this product was great for my cuticles. I couldn't tell about my nails, because it was such a nuisance to get the product out of its miniscule tube that I couldn't readily use it as often as recommended, and I am convinced that one quarter of the stuff remains inaccessible deep in the tube, despite all my efforts to squeeze it out. I would like to see this product in a one or two ounce size; otherwise I fear it is quite overpriced, given how much of it I can't get to!"
3,A solid foundation for a beginner,"This book is a solid foundation for a beginner. I've read about 6 or 7 real estate books, and I would put this one probably at #3. The book is definitely concise - maybe a little too concise... and that's one of the reasons I see it as a book that introduces a concept, but stops there.I have been interested in investing in real estate for a few years now. At 23, I am a first-time homebuyer. I only own one house, and I am already familiar with every concept he introduces in this book. On the positive side, he discusses those concepts with a down-to-earth mentality and routinely translates to layman's terms, although, again, he oversimplifies and leaves out the details of how to put some ideas into action.Broad conceptual overview. Realistic. Concise. Easy read. Not a waste of money unless you're already a successful real estate investor."
5,Highly Recommended,I highly recommend this book. It gives one a good leg up when starting to invest in Real Estate.
3,Its ok,"I have high expectations for everything, and this book was just ""OK"". This is the first Real Estate book I bought and found that about 50% of the material I already knew. This is a good first book though for anyone who is wanting to start learning up on Real Estate Investment."
3,Good book for a beginning real estate investor,"There are many books out there that are great read for beginning real estate investors, and this sure is one of them."
1,Broke within a month,We use a melon baller nearly every day to core apples and pears so when my last one finally broke after 15 years I looked for a replacement with a similar sturdy handle. This one seemed perfect with a great handle. We use it daily and always hand-wash so it is ready for its next adventure... Unfortunately this morning the bowl broke away cleanly at the handle at the solder/joint. I recognize that we may have received a dud and all the others are great but this one barely lasted a month.
2,Misleading Name,"When I bought this shirt, it said, ""Disney Mickey...Tee for woman(Medium)"" and that's not a correct label. It should say ""Tee for GIRLS (medium)"" because it doesn't fit me. It fits my 9-year-old daughter.I didn't give it a one-star rating, because it's a nice shirt. The fabric's comfy. The design is pretty. It's fashionable.I would've given it a five-star rating, if the title had said GIRLS shirt instead of women's. The only reason I gave it a low rating is because it's frustrating to buy something labeled for women and have it arrive and be five sizes too small."
3,Not too shabby,"My only complaint are two very dated songs that don't go with the flow of the rest of the cd, and they are Then Came You with a very dated sounding doo wop group, and Valley of The Dolls, also they should have included a hit sha had in the late 60's ""Odds & Ends"", my personal favorite Dionne Warwick song. This is a ok ""best of colelction"", but it could have been so much better considering that there is room for about 26 songs on thsi cd and they gave us a mere 16, which is why you should only buy this if found at a very budget price."
4,"worked well, but burned out quickly....","These work well, but one bulb burned out quickly. It could have been the wiring or vibrations on my antique BMW, but I'm not positive. I like Hella products and have never had a problem in the past, hence my 4 star raiting."
3,Fog Light Upgrade,"I was a little disappointed with this bulb. I think the wattage is an upgrade from my original equipment and the there is a noticable difference in light coverage, but I do not see any yellow in the beam as I thought I would."
3,A Priestly Source,"I used this book for a class in Seminary. To me it feels like a history of the priesthood. Which is what the bulk of the book is. However, I'm not going to be a diocesan priest. I'm in a religious community and I'm not going to be a religious priest either. If you're a lay person this book is not for you unless you want a history of priesthood. If you want to be a priest within a religious community you are going to find much lacking that is relevant to your experience. However, if the diocesan priesthood is your calling, I recommend it."
1,Cheaper just to buy at the store,The discs work fine but the shipping is more than the cost of the actual product (something that I unfortunately didn't check before clicking buy now). It's cheaper to buy it at the store.
1,It Stunk,The Product came nice but was so slow in downloading from my computer. Don't waste your money!!
4,Super Cute book,"This book has great illustrations and a cute storyline. It is a great tool for teaching young kids about seabirds, and is all around fun to read as well. I wish it was still being printed. The used copy I purchased was in great shape and shipped fast."
4,Certain Foods Discolor The Spoons,"This review relates only to the Gerber silicone-tipped spoons that come in this set. They are great spoons, but the lighter colored spoon permanently discolored when I used it to feed carrots to my son. The workaround is to use the darker colored spoons for carrots. Other than that, they hold up well and are perfectly sized for tiny mouths."
3,Not the best cups,I love these spoons- the soft tips make them gentle on tender gums. The bowl is nice- although the suction could be stronger.The big complaint I have- and I have had this problem with other Gerber cups I have purchased- the valves fall out while my daughter is using the cups. I don't always notice until it is too late and they have leaked all over. Not so good on the highway!I like the one piece valve- but I have had better luck with other cups- Playtex is my favorite sippy.
1,Not Happy!!!,"I ordered this product because it was only way I could find the spoons that I thought were silicone covered. First of all, the bowl was missing out of the set I received. I checked to see if the packing slip had the same item number and it did, but I only got the spoons and sippy cups. I was so mad. I couldn't wait to send the ""set"" back. After trying to find the spoons elsewhere and not being able to find them I thought I would just suck it up and keep the set. I then opened the spoons to find that they were covered in hard plastic! Yuck. I will be sending this product back ASAP!"
3,not presentation worthy,"We ordered this item from a friend's baby registry. What we received was a large, ugly brown box with several individual items sealed on hanging cards for store display. It had to be repacked and was not what we expected to present as a gift."
3,No flowery words of romance here.,"Not your usual romance tale. There are no flowery words here. Rolfe the Relentless rides into Ceidre's life like the Norman conqueror that he is. I did find some of this rather hard to believe... ...The ending of the book is just as off-key as the rest, although, quite frankly, probably more along the lines of what really could have happened in that time period. A decent read, it is more along the lines of ""The Wolf and the Dove"", conqueror and vanquished finding love in the face of unbelievable adversity and against all odds."
3,"not enough ""romance""","Being sexually attracted to another does not equal love for me as a reader. The Conqueror was a page turner, but still left me wanting. There were not enough soft moments between the main characters for me to rate this book any higher than three stars. In fact the first one hundred or so pages was pretty distasteful - but I kept reading because so many of the reviews made it sound like things would be great eventually.I didn't particularly like Rolf, which was a problem. I just thought he was too much of a brute. Although, I will say that the tender moments between he and Ceidre were lovely - there just weren't enough of them. I like a harsh hero - but this guy was a little too much even for me."
1,The only good thing about this book is the epilogue.,"I don't know why everybody praises this book so highly, while I found it so terrible. I would sugest some other books with the same settings such as My Lord Conqueror by Samantha James and The Prize by Julie Garwood. I'll gladly give five stars ++ for those two. They are just awesome. Don't be offended, I usually like Brenda Joyce's, but this one is just not for me."
2,true love prevails through the most unlikely situation,"I enjoyed this book so much, i read it straight through in one day. when i finished, i just kinda sat back and thought about how sweetly the romance worked out but then i was like ""wait... that's not right"" because it SHOUDN'T of worked out. It was sweet because true love won out, but ciedre's love must have been seriously stong to over look some of the issues Rolfe had. Issues like rape and slaughter. Her first encounter w/ him resulted in him knocking her flat on her back and nearly rapeing her. If it had been me, i would have never forgiven him for just that. But ciedre kept comming back to him even after he did rape her and on her WEDDING night. Thats just twisted. I understand that the whole feminist thing was hundreds of years from taking place, but did that girl completely lack good sense? the reason I only gave it 2 stars is beacuse she actually made love to Rolfe right after he raped her. Its too perverted for my taste."
2,Meh- Realistic and Unrealistic (possible spoillers but not too many),"The characters themselves match their time. Their love and the way they reconcile dont. Ceidre would have been hung by William the Conqueror. Edwin would not have received clemency either.The book should have been longer. Less than ten pages was devoted to their reconciliation. You cant cram a reconciliation after such extreme actions like treason in a couple of pages. In their time Rolfe would have hunted her down to kill her. I like Brenda Joyce, but the ending in this one was just too rushed. It's almost as if she realized she was coming up on her publisher's deadline or the publisher wanted to ""trim fat"" out of the book so the ending did not receive the attention the rest of the book did. I felt it was a sad disappointment."
1,This is a romance?,"Once again, rape, infidelity and kinky sex passed off as romance. This is not a romance, it's utter trash! AND the author clearly has not researched the medieval time period, so it's like modern trash in a historical setting. I'd skip this one."
2,The 100 Most Recent Pretty Good Players ?,"Recent players who are good get included, many great players from bygone eras get totally neglected."
2,I was excited to read this book,"This is a difficult review to write, because I so rarely write average reviews. I was excited to have a look at this book after reading the fantastic reader comments, and because the author is from my hometown. What I read disappointed me. I found the writing choppy and difficult to understand in some chapters. I was looking for beautiful artwork to compliment the written pages, but did not find any. This book read as if the author threw the pages together in one weekend. A disappoinment."
5,Thank Heaven for Rebecca Pittman,"This book gave me everything I need to start my own faux painting business, including confidence! Thank you Rebecca for the insight, the humor and the weekly accounting ledger located in the back. Great, superb, and HIGHLY recommended."
5,just what I wanted,"I am building a successful business, the book was a confirmation for me in many ways but then again I also learned some new things and got some good reminders of what I should be doing but havn't been. The best book I have purchased. If the author were to read this, I would certainly want to thank her."
5,The most informative book I have ever read.,"I am so impressed by the detailed information in this book. I have been looking for months for the start-up information that I have found in this one book. Comparing this book to others I have read,it appears that the author has not missed any of the facts that I needed to know about starting a painting business. When I got the book, and started reading, I could not put it down for fear that I was going to miss something important. I am so excited to start my new job and put all of the great information to use. Thank you for of you help, Sincerely, Krissie O'Neal"
5,No more starving artists!,"I have been painting murals and doing faux finishing, decorative paint, etc. for 11 years myself, and this is the first book that isn't laden with pretty pictures...it has the nuts and bolts of a business. When I started out professionally in this business I was 19 and had no idea how to run a successful business. Sure, I could paint anything I was asked, but that's not how you become a success, alone. Understanding the labor and customer service skills required, the marketing techniques and time management, those are the pitfalls of many artists, like myself. I learned the game as I went, but I made many mistakes. Reading this book gave me some clarity on my own business issues, and gave me some insight on how to tackle them. Most of us looking into purchasing this book are talented artists of some sort, usually people like us aren't the type to run a business too well, until you learn the ropes. Ever heard of a starving artist? WIth this book you will no longer be one!"
1,Not as pictured,Bought this and it is NOT as pictured. There is no control dial to it. It is either on or it is off. VERY disappointed in Amazon.
3,Small & Simple,"I just bought this model at a thrift shop for $8.00. I haven't tried it yet (other than plugging it in to see if it worked), but it looked unused and very clean. I kind of liked the simplicity of small size and no controls. I still have my larger Crock Pot for chickens or bigger meals, but I think I'll like this for a quart of split pea soup, or for keeping rolls warm. It should be easy to clean and carry, & it'll be interesting to find out if the lack of controls will make it last longer....one fewer part to break down. I have a feeling most people unplug slow cookers when not in use anyway."
2,Makes a nice KV- switch.,"Purchased this with the expectation of full use of what is now standard 3-button/wheel mice (PS2). After neither an XP nor an NT4 system booted with mouse support I sent an email to Hawking Tech. Support. Their response was ""We can only guarantee full compatiblity with 2 button mice. -- Hawking Technical Support (CH)""The product is being returned... my search goes on."
3,Power-UP Problems,"for laptops this needs an AC adapter that is not included. For my desktop computer I boot my computer and it doesn't recognize my mouse for WindowsXP... If I hit restart a couple times before the screen appears it then works fine. I assume this has something to do with the lack of power. It is inconvenient, but I gues it works fine."
1,Wrong fit,"Fits the 2005 Xterra, not the 2005 Pathfinder. Item therefore completely useless for me even though the Amazon spec check feature said it would work."
4,nice piece if furniture,This is a nice bookcase. Very easy to put together. I filled it with hard cover books and it's holding up just fine.
1,Does This Make Sense?,"Why would anyone pay $20 for an aged and poor translation of two works that are in the public domain and can be accessed for free? This isn't publishing, it's trolling for dollars. I wonder what the great Hugo would have thought of such a ploy... Preface de Cromwell and Hernani are both valuable relics of the Romantic movement in France. It is a service to English-speaking American readers to make such historic texts available. But please: faire un effort, as Hugo might have said. Better to have a new and decent translation with an accompanying, enlightened commentary--especially if you're going to ask people to pay for something they can get elsewhere for free."
1,Didn't Realize It Was In French!!,"I'll be lecturing on Giuseppe Verdi's opera ""Ernani"" for Chicago's Lyric Opera this fall, and I want to read Victor Hugo's play ""Hernani"" on which the opera is based. But I didn't expect this publication to be in the original French which I don't read. I returned it and paid S & H charges because it was ""purchaser's error.""."
2,"Starts strong, then fizzles","I loved ""Everything & More"" and ""Bleeding London,"" and while this book started with Nicholson's trademark razor-wire wit, I thought the last quarter or so of the book suffered from awkward, forced and unbelievable resolutions. I also found some of the social observations, which were so keen in the other Nicholson books I'd read, to be unconvincing and even, in some cases, irrelevant to the main story. I will say, though, that his metaphors are great, and I love the irony of a book of collected anecdotes railing against the collecting of anecdotes (among other things). I say skip this one and go right to ""Everything & More."""
1,"This light has a blue crystal= blue light, Worthless!","Don't waste your money, buy the white crystal version! I should have checked this particular product closer,my Bad! The description, as with all the Sapphire lights, says it is visible for one mile, that might be true but it is practically useless for the user to see any detail with it. Nowhere does it state that it emits a blue light, only that it has a blue crystal. I have bought Sapphire lights before, those have a very bright white light, very useful. This one is very disappointing. Compared this one side by side with the white crystal version and they are nothing alike. If you like an eerie blue mood light, then go for it."
2,Price vs Effectiveness,"The Banalg ""Hospital strength"" worked better than this and was only $12-$13 bottle.I am told it is no longer available. I bought this as I was suffering bad and needed relief, and it did work, although not as well as the other product. I will not purchase again as the ingredients can be found in much cheaper varieties of muscle pain relief creams."
4,Muscle Pain Relief...Banalg,I have found Banalg to be an effective pain reliever for normal muscle strains and arthritis flair-ups.It has been particularly effective for lower back pain and elbow joint stiffness/pain. It quickly dries and doesn't stain clothing.This is my second bottle in slightly more than a year and I remain very satisfied. It is a little 'pricey' but well worth the expense.
4,It Works and it's fast,"The only reason this didn't get 5 stars is that it could possibly be a little smaller.That aside, this baby works great. No driver installation or other fiddling required, just plug it in. It runs 100MB in FULL duplex, so it is very fast. I use it in the lab to talk to routers and terminal servers. At home it's a fast way to load SiteScooper web clippings and to save backups.All in all, an excellent value."
2,"Same as TrendNet TE-CF100, Pharos PE-CE100","After a length search online tonight for a replacement to my TrendNet TE-CF100, I found the Hawking and Pharos models.Upon closer inspection, it seems that these 3 devices are all the same, but with different branding.How did I find out?Apart from looking strikingly similar, the latest drivers from Hawking technologies are _identical_ to the ones from TrendNet. The driver package from Pharos is also identical except for the driver DLL itself, which is a little over 21 days older. Otherwise, the files are exactly identical, have the same time/date stamp, and have the same readme.txt files, etc. Therefore, you might want to give the Pharos (the latest driver I could find) a try.I have several PPC 2003s, and the latest TrendNet driver (v1.5) doesn't work well under any device at all. It's damn slow (3kb/s) Version 1.4 is MUCH better, but you'll need to email tech support at TrendNet to get a copy. They are still not perfect though...[...]PB."
3,"Empezó bien, pero luego dejo mucho que desear...","La tarjeta funciono sin mayores inconvenientes en mi ppc con ppc2002, pero al actualizar mi sistema al wm2003 me contacte con los del soporte y me dijeron simplemente que no tenian el driver y que no sabian cuando iban a lanzar un nuevo controlador o incluso me dejo en duda si lo harían. Estoy muy desilucionado con el soporte de hawking technology."
1,Drivers won't install,"I am trying to use this product with an IPAQ 5455 plus expansion pack, but haven't been able to get the Pocket PC drivers to install. Hawking Tech support has not been able to help. If you don't need to install drivers to use this on your set up then you may be ok, otherwise beware"
2,Poorly written,"I tried reading this book but found it so turgid and poorly written that I put it down in frustration. It reads like a translation from another language by an academic bureacrat. The theme is interesting, the execution poor. Cannot recommend."
2,"It's okay, for a while.","This cover fit well, maybe a little too well. Putting it on isn't too hard, just very time consuming. Take it from me, it's much easier if a friend helps. I only rate it three stars, because the second a rock hits it, it begins tearing. It will slowly rip the full length of the bra. Granted, I drive some pretty rough roads, mine lasted just over a year and a half before it was too tattered to keep on anymore. If you do mostly city/freeway driving, you will probably be fine.I live in Seattle, so it got wet... Don't let it get wet. It will get very moldy, very quickly. It will warp your paint underneath. Make sure to adjust it, and tighten it at least once per day. This thing was a bit of a hassle. I won't be buying another one."
5,Great Camera for the Money !!,"After much research and shopping, the XTsi has the most versatility and features for the money. Most retail stores in the area only sell the less expensive Minolta Maxxum cameras at the same price as the XTsi here at Amazon. The panoramic option is great for those senic mountain views and the camera is truely intuitive. I would recommend this camera to anyone who is either just getting into photography or is looking to step up from a compact 35mm camera."
5,great little film type camera,"this is a great camera,but the batteries can be a problem. they lose their charge if not used for a year. best bet is to get a battery charger"
1,Not worth the money,"I received this as a gift, and I'm glad I wasn't the one who paid money for it. It's nothing more than a catalog of one company's products."
2,a book for high school graduates,"Ok,this book it's nothing special.We all know that every good paid job is related to stress and so is the lawyers life. We all know that we will burn out if we work 12 hours per day, not taking care of our personal life, family, hobbies etc. This book I would recommend to high school students before he/she enters into a real hard working life to be prepared and take into account what they should have in mind in order to keep balance and satisfaction in life."
5,Gold Found,"Judge Horn has done the practicing Bar and those interested in understanding the legal world an admirable service. He has soaked up the ore in all the literature available about the pitfalls and pinnacles of the legal profession, combined it with his own experience as a practicing lawyer and judge and given us a compelling and lucid overview of the qualities and values at stake in today's legal landscape. The result is a comprehensive but concise picture that is pure gold for anyone seeking to get his or her bearings in today's legal world, be they the disillusioned practicing lawyer or the Bar President seeking to articulate the highest standard of what law practice can be. The book with a deft touch combines legal history and legal philosophy with practical down to earth common sense advice. I would encourage anyone who has lost their footing practicing law, or who wants to seriously reflect on where meaning comes from in practicing law to get and read this book."
4,Gearplier set,This set does the job. Change the jaws for tight places. Works well. Solid and strong. Not a cheap set. Good quality. Heavy duty.Can't give it a 5 star because I haven't used all the different jaws.
1,Total Waste of Money!!!!!,"I have always partially believed in astrology and bought the hardcover version for this book, seeing all the good reviews about it. When it arrived on my doorstep I eagerly flipped through the pages hoping I could at least find some accurate facts about myself, instead everything written was totally OFF about me!! I was not satisfied as I paid a lot for this piece of crap, and I could have been an anomaly so I tested it on many other friends of mine hoping to find some information about them that's at least a little accurate and I was dumbfounded by the reviews that this book is even a lil' bit accurate. EVERYTHING WRITTEN HAS BEEN WRONG ABOUT EVERY SINGLE PERSON I KNOW!!! A total waste of money :("
2,Don't waste your money.,"I liked the idea of a book that could give you life guidance based on the day you were born = an aspect of astrology. I know you ought to take this stuff with a grain of salt, but even then, this book is lacking.The text often contradicts what is already established by many when it comes to one's zodiac sign. It is informational in that it gives examples, descriptive words, and names of famous others with the same birthday.This is an amusing read, but a hit and miss when it comes to accuracy. I may sell mine or give it to a friend."
3,Fun to read but you will quickly tire,"Each birthday gets two pages of trivia such as who was born on this day, a personality evaluation, numbers & planets, tarot, health, advice, meditation, and more. Just imagine being born on 20 April. Adolf Hitler. The book is too old to remember the Columbine shootings.There are a few other sections in the book that cover periods in the zodiac cycle.Nice superficial book that may give you some conversation for a day or two. This also makes a good coffee-table book. Soon though even your visitors will get bored with the book.If you like this book you will love ""You Were Born on a Rotten Day"" by Jim Critchfield.You were born on a rotten day"
5,Birthday Book,"This book takes the traditional zodiac and expands it. In addition to a Sun Sign for people born during a moon cycle, the book also provides information about each of us based on the particular day of birth. I find it fascinating that the majority of the people who read about their day of the year agree that the book does describe them."
5,This is a WONDERFUL book!,A friend showed this book to me and I absolutely loved it! It's so interesting and (this is an absolute must for any review of this book) UNCANNY!
5,5 years later,I read this book when it first came out and it was very 'spooky'as someone else described the feeling. I am a Doctoral student in Comp. Sci. and my wife is a Psychologist. We are both amazed. The study of Astrology has been around since the time of Adam and Eve maybe before. There must be some truth to it.
5,reviews your whole untill your last thought in two pages,Incredibly reviews your whole life; from the moment you were born until the last ting that happenes in your life one second before reading the book. Its amazing
2,Good book but no cover,"I already knew the book as I had seen it at Barnes & Noble... I just didn't want to pay their price so I searched for it on-line. The book is the book regardless... but nowhere did it state that it didn't have a cover. I wish I had known, as I had other sellers at the time that I could have bought this from."
3,Disappointed with Condition of New Book on arrival,Felt the standard has slipped since the purchase of my first book at Amazon.The service for the purchase of my first book was above my expectation.I liked the competitive price & was most impressed with the speed of its arrival.This latest purchase (The Secret Language of Birthdays by Goldschneider) was a gift to my daughter.She was disappointed to find that several pages within this new hardcover book were folded in & creased!
4,The Ultimate Coffee Table Book?,"For starters, I do not believe in astrology at all; it's always just predictions vague enough to make anyone think, ""Hey, that IS how I feel sometimes now that you mention it."" That being said, this book is actually pretty specific and usually right. It won't make you enroll in the next astrology course at the local Learning Annex, but it does make you scratch your head a little bit. The best way to use it in my opinion is to have a person give you a few birthdays of people they know, read them all to him and then have him try to match up the write-up with the person. They're often correct.Again, I'll eat my hat before I say I believe in astrology, but for what it's worth, the book's definitely got entertainment value."
5,Writing on a razor's edge,"Astrology is a really controversial issue, and I did not believe in anything related with this before read this book in an airport bookstore. Everywhere I read about my sign they tell me wrong stuff and general things. After read Goldschneider book, however, I begin to believe that there is some sense at all in this matter. He made no mistakes about me, and was absolutely precise about my way of thinking. I read friends, parents and relatives descriptions too, and the level of precision was also incredable, without deep errors or misconceptions.The research he said he made can explain much of what is said. Even if the complete meaning of what can explain astrology is obscure yet, this book has a very accurate text."
2,Accurate? - Maybe. For me - Not even close.,"*sigh* Where do I begin? Yes I know this book is for entertainment purposes only, however I was a little disturbed to find that my birthday was completely inaccurate. Given that my birthday is Nov. 25th I immediately looked to the side (before I read) to find that Tina Turner shares my birthday...except this is FALSE! Her birthday is Nov. 26th. Needless to say I continued to read, only to find that the description of my birthday completely fits Tina (coincidentally) but she wasn't even born on that day. It would have been nice to see what someone else thought to be were my true birthday characteristics, as oppose to something fabricated around a person whose b/day is actually the next day. Putting that aside I read on of my friend's/family's birthdays and this book hit 50% of the time. I'll put this book in the back closet to collect cobwebs, until I need it one cold winter day to burn."
1,Most negative astrology book I've EVER read!,"I wish there was a way to put negative stars - that's how much I disliked the overwhelming negativity of this book! Every single entry seemed to focus on the NEGATIVE aspects of each birthday - instead of the positive. I thought at first it was only my birthday (I received the book as a gift for my birthday coming up on July 22) - but I read the entries for all of my family members and friends - and they ALL highlight the negative. I think my Mom wasted $$ on this book! I would much rather read an astrology book that highlights the positive, while making you aware of the areas in which you can improve! I give this book a MINUS 5 rating! Save your money for a GOOD book!"
2,Wicked Book,"This book is not to be taken seriously. However, because it is often accurate, you cannot not take it seriously. And when you do, you will lose yourself. You will believe whatever the book says about you. The more you dwell into it, the more you become out of touch with reality. Some people who got hooked on this book actually lost their jobs, their houses, and their personal life. This book will cause turmoil once you believe in it. Absolutely destructive."
4,Mystical & Hypnotic,This book was amazing! I couldn't put it down! My birthday profile was exactly me! I never thought of myself as a mystical/spiritual kind of person but I had a hard time doubting this book. I found myself looking up friends' birthdays and seeing how their birthday profile fit them. It's a great book!!
5,This Book is Truely Spooky!,"When I read my date, I about fell out of my chair. I'm not one to dwell into the astral, mystic realm... or give it much more than an entertaining glance from time to time. THIS BOOK FREAKED ME OUT MAN!!!!!! I felt as if this guy had lived with me my entire life. Same went for everyone in the room. I mean we have all read horoscopes that reflect some degree of accuracy, but nothing like this. Very concise, but extremely accurate. With every sentence my jaw dropped further. This book has really made me reevaluate the validity of the whole supernatural ""thang"". You gotta get it!"
4,"Fun to read, a great reference for your shelf!","This book profiles each birthday quite accurately based on my own profile and those of people I know. That being said, for as big of a book as this is, the profiles are quite broad and don't offer highly detailed insight into each one. After all, it does cover 366 birthdays. If you're looking for a great reference to have on your shelf to refer to when learning about a person, or even a fun conversation starter for house parties and gatherings, this is a great book. However, if you're seeking more detailed insight into a particular sign, you should opt for a book geared specifically toward that type of person."
5,Love this book!,"Its so much fun, and I have found it to be so right on. It lists your strengths and weaknesses. It has characteristics of someone born your day and lists famous people that share your bday! FUN!"
4,"Book in great quality, but shipping took a little long","I'm very pleased with the quality and condition of the item I purchased, it was exactly as they described it. The only thing I took exception to was the time it took to receive my item even though I lived in the same state they were shipping from. The shipping experience isn't something that would prevent me from ordering next time...Thanks."
1,WTF?,"Complete hogwash. If you really want an accurate summation of your personality; take a Myers-Briggs personality type test. If you believe that your zodiac symbol is the reason why Venus and Neptune are aligned and that's the reason why you are in a bad mood, or a relationship ended; then you will not have trouble believing this crap. It's just something entertaining to pull out at a party. The likelihood that anything is accurate is just a flip of the coin."
4,Recipient was very happy!,"I bought this book as a gift and the recipient loved it. She is not really a book-lover, but she thought this book was fascinating. I gave it to her on Christmas day and she looked at it all weekend, looking up everyones birthday and sharing it with the rest of us. She called me up and told me that she reads it all of the time. Out of the 4 gifts that I gave her, this was not the most expensive, but it seems to be the one that she liked the best."
4,Beter then your average horoscope books,"Rather then just reading a horoscope book that deals with each sign this book separates each day of the year so people can have a more in-depth read on themselves and those born on each day of the year. You can also learn who shares your date of birth, find out various things on your zodiac sign, what element you are, etc. This book is full of fascinating and interesting facts, most of which were true for myself at least."
1,Secret Language Snakeoil,"If you are going to buy this book, don't start by reading yourbirthday. Pick your birthday and four random dates and have a friendread them to you without telling you which date is which. Score howwell each description applies to you on a scale of 1-10 (1 lowest-10highest)I have done this with five people so far. No one has scoredtheir birthday the highest of all descriptions read. Two have scoredtheir birthday as 1 out of 10...It is a testament to thescientific illiteracy of our country that someone can make moneyselling this... How ironic you can buy it through your computer onAmazon in the most technologically advanced country on earth"
3,People can take this a little too far...it's ruined my life.,"When I first got this book I found it interesting. I didn't think it was a 100% accurate, but it did it's job as an interesting read. Unfortunately someone close to me picked up the book and took it as 100% fact and took it way too far. This person decided to critisize every one and spent countless hours explaining how I can't be a caring person because the book didn't say I was caring. The funniest part is that this person's strength is versatile, which they took to mean adaptable and so decided that if they wanted they could possess any characteristic they like, making them faultless of course. I would just caution anyone who picks up this book to take it as a general description of a person and not as absolute truth to live your life by."
5,Incredibly Accurate,"I found this book by accident when I was in the library during lunchtime when I was in school. Holy $*^@! This book is typically dead on.With all of my friends, family, and people I have looked up, it is usually about 90% accurate, sometimes more, sometimes less. With everyone I have looked up, it is accurate in some way.I am a skeptic when it comes to the astrology things you read in the newspaper, and before I read this book, about astrology in general. However, everyone should read this book. It will redefine how you think of astrology."
5,"It's a book, and contains what you'd expect. Amusing!","Highly entertaining book! If you want to have fun, and don't take this sort of thing too seriously, I highly recommend it. If you DO take this sort of thing as total fact/truth, more power to you. ""Today you will have a deep feeling"" ""Today you will make a choice that will change your life"" Horoscopes and astrology are as ambiguous as they are for a reason. ***FOR ENTERTAINMENT ONLY***"
5,FREAKISHLY ACCURATE: A MUST BUY!,"I first noticed this book while in a local Barnes and Noble, I picked it up because it looked interesting and seriously read it for hours while in the store. I read the birthday analysis for every person who's birthday I knew off the top of my head and it described each one to a tee! For example, I have a friend born April 14 who recently expressed her interest in getting cosmetic surgery. When I read up on her, it even revealed that she would highly consider undergoing a cosmetic surgery at somepoint in her life... WOW. I couldn't stop thinking about this book weeks later so I purchased it on Amazon, which has a much better price! This exact book was nearly $50 at Barnes and Noble. Great Conversation Book."
4,Decent Book on Astrology,"This book was pretty good in explaining the different ""pieces"" that make up the science of astrology. The accuracy of each day was also about 75% correct, for the most part. It's not as vague as some astrology books, that's for sure. Not a bad book for the money."
5,it's great!,"This book is great, i bought it for my sister, as i already have one of my own, and considering it had to travel from america, it got here very fast!"
1,What's up with this DVD set,"This is perhaps the worst DVD set I've ever owned. It is composed in no particular sequence - as already outlined in a previous review it starts (Disk 1 part 1) half way through a build and half way through the season. Then you have to hunt through the remaining 5 DVD's to find the rest of the episodes. There is no idexing, DVD extras or any other features. If I had taped the show from the original broadcast and simply burnt it randomly on to DVD's I would have come up with the same product. Discovery's first season release was also terrible as you have to purchase each episode one at a time, but at least you could figure out the logic to the composition.Overall - the worst DVD ""set"" ever - way to go discovery."

3,Good BCP Reference,"It is a good BCP Reference, instead of not making further comments and explanations about the Crisis Management Subject"
1,Too much stuff,"I was project leader for Business Contingency planning and was looking for sound practical advice on how to proceed.Frankly, this book is very wooly and contains far too much stuff.Definitely not worth the money"
1,SHOWER BOOK FAILS,"I WAS EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED IN THIS BOOK. THE GAME SUGESTIONS WERE TIRED AND ONE DOESN'T NEED SEVERAL COPIES OF GAME FORMS TO WASTE PAGES. MENUS WERE NOT INNOVATIVE,IN FACT,NOTHING WAS."
1,Very very very poor range!!! Don't buy! Buy DCT756-3 instead.,"I've bought one DCT756-3 (2.4 GHz) for my mother in law before. It's great. I was expecting DXI5586-3 to be even better, since it's 5.8 GHz. It's not! DXI5586-3 has a very poor range. Any 900 MHz cordless phone you can buy for US$ 10 is better than DXI5586-3. Don't buy it. You'll waste your money and your time. You'd better buy an old DCT756-3, which is much better."
1,Absolute Garbage--DO NOT BUY!!!,"Someone in my family bought these phones to replace the 2 handset system we had when 1 of those 2 handsets stopped working. The phones do work and are able to make/receive calls. However, besides that they are useless. They do not have speakerphone (which is quite useful when you are on hold for 5+ minutes). Also, you can't talk on more than 1 handset at a time (which is quite useful when 2 people in the house both want to be talking to someone, usually a relative). So if you want a completely basic phone set with no frills or extra features, go ahead and buy it. If you want something useful, please do the research that my family member did not do and shop for something else."
1,Poor range.,"Very poor range. Tried everything. Phone broke up from one room to the next.My old 900 MHz phone worked much, much better. This purchase was returned."
2,added bonus!!!,Well at first it was annoying that we couldnt use 2 phones at once but then I realized that my wife couldn't snoop in on my phone conversations!!
2,Ciao Bambino,"We were so disappointed with this book that we returned it. For the price, it's a very thin book - only 30 pages. For preparing a child for a trip to Italy, the illustrations were especially disppointing. Only a few offered images of what might be seen in Italy. Most of the others were generic illustrations that could have been set anywhere, such as a child and his stuffed bear eating a pizza, the circle of a flashlight beam on the pavement."
1,Too generic,"I bought this book for my children before heading to Italy. I thought it would be the perfect ""map"" for them. I was sorely mistaken. This book is too generic, trite, and offered little that I could not. It is basic to a fault. Neither one of my children liked the book. We ended up giving it away."
1,Flawed Product,Tried it in 3 seperate computers - 2 xp 1 vista - and the software does not work. Messages refer to files that are missing or in the wrong directory.
2,For kids,I got a bad taste from this software for 2 reasons.1. It's not for adults.2. The Mac version seems to be a bad port of the Windows version. It pounds the processor. It also requires the CD to be present in the drive in order to function.So this may be ok (not great) for a child on a Windows machine (with the CD always present) otherwise you can do better even with free podcasts.
2,"Okay for immersion, not good for traveling","I was pretty disappointed with this software. It's good for people who really want to learn the language, but I was looking for something I could use for my trip, and it hasn't been that helpful. It's also not the most user-friendly program in the world."
3,good soccer game,"this is a really good soccer game but there are some things missing. The graphics are really good but the computer has a really big advantage over you. there are a lot of special moves that are almost impossible to do which the computer will do very easily. Also you can't really see everything you need to be able to pass to your players, there's a lot of different camera angles but none of them are perfect. The computer will see a lot of excellent passes that you won't be able to see. It is a fun game to play with your friends. I'm being a little strict on it because it is a good game to play but those things did bother me when I played it."
1,What improvements,"What a disappointment. The ""new"" passing game means you have no control of where your passes are going to go. They decided to change the shot control, so what used to be a shot to the top left corner of the net now goes to the left corner of the field. The controls are extremely sluggish and frequently unresponsive. The computer changes your players for you, paticularly when you don't want it to. If I had a nickle for every time one of my players has taken the ball away from the other team in my own 18 yard box, only to turn around and run away from the ball, I'd have enough money to buy back my copy of FIFA 2001. Oh, and the game has slow down problems. Yuck."
1,A Major Disappointment,"I don't know how it is possible to make a great game alot worse, but FIFA 2002 manages to do it. While FIFA 2001 is one of the greatest console sports title ever released, FIFA 2002 is probably one of the worst EA Sports game in a long time. To start off, the much vaunted passing system is frustratingly inaccurate and unpredictable. The multitude of skill moves that made FIFA 2001 such an exciting game of precise timing is now gone. Plus, all the cameras (even with maximum zoom) show the players as tiny little dots on the field, thus making accurate tackling and dribbling a total guess work. While hard core soccer afficinados might believe that this version is a bit more realistic simulation of soccer than FIFA 2001, it is certainly alot less fun. Actually, it is no fun at all."
3,A good arcade game,"This game is in keeping with EA's current trend of making more Arcade-style games rather than sports simulations. If you're looking for a fun time playing soccer, pick it up. It's got great graphics, all the teams you could possibly want and easy controls. If you want a real soccer game (i.e. scores like 1-0 and 2-1) then go online and find yourself a version of Championship Manager for the PC or one of the plethora of other great, realistic soccer games they have in Europe."
4,Unique Journal for Tim Burton fans,"It is exactly as the amazon.com product description states. It is, above all, a blank journal. It is printed on gray paper. The left pages are lined; the right pages are blank with Burton's artwork on the right side and corner. I think these are hard to find. I ordered mine through amazon.ca because they said they could get it in one to two months. It took three and a half months, but it was worth the wait since I couldn't even find it through Dark Horse Comics."
4,Heavily into the Theoretical,"Even though this book is primarily intended for researchers and grad students, it leaves very little of the topic of fracture mechanics untouched. All the way from calculating relatively simple K factors to the intricate J- and P- Integrals, the book provides the equations that are needed for almost any research project, especially in the Elastic-Plastic region.It addresses 'arrays of cracks', which is quite unusual, as well as other fairly rare geometric crack situations that are rather difficult to find in the literature.One other interesting thing to note is the substantial amount of material devoted to the treatment of Mode II and Mode III cracks, not found in many other texts since Mode I is the predominate crack propogation mode in industry.I would highly recommend it for any researcher in the field, but generally not recommend it for general practice limited to LEFM (Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics)."
4,Buy all of his other stuff before you buy this,"This album isn't terrible but it's definitely not his best. If you are new to Mr. Sche I would recommend going with ""A Work of Art"" or ""The Only Life I Know"". You can find these albums, and all of his others including all the Immortal Lowlife album's on www.mrsche.com or www.iapstore.com."
4,Challenging but risky,"Edit - DHW is an amateur historian who can be termed professional only by fact of his having written books. A large part of his personal history is invalid and apparently designed only to increase historical credentials that do not exist.Read the book, it is enjoyable, but be aware that he is heavily biased towards the French and as he is not an academic historian his interpretations can not be guarenteed with any certainty."
1,Beware!,"See some of the reviews of this author's ""Waterloo - New Perspectives"". He is not all that he makes out to be and neither are his books."
1,Sloppy Research or Sheer Fantasy?,"It was not for reasons of ""sloppy research"" that the publisher of this author cancelled the third volume. It was because the facts about both this author and his work became public knowledge."
1,Original....you betcha,"This authors sources are so original he wrote them himself...If you try and verify any of the source material for anything other than ""common knowledge"" you will find that that those cited have no bearing on the subject at hand...This goes beyond sloppy scholorship.... It gets one star because I cant give it a zero...buy it only if you need firewood"
1,Bad History From Another Brit,"This writer may be able to turn a phrase or two, but his research contains so many blatantly false source claims that the book is rendered as nothing more than fiction. Even with so many bad British ""historians"" already populating the Napoleonic history field, this author may rank as the worst."
2,buyers beware,"the pic on this site looks like an h1 bulb, but when i got mine, the box says h7 and its also labeled on the bulb housing. AMAZON, pls double ck before you ship items out. h1 isn't an h7 bulb. this really sucks as i like hella bulbs, but, i may have to go with philips on this one. now, i have to go to the post office to mail back the box. wasted time and gas."
4,Best all around H1 bulb,"These bulbs are brighter than everything I have tried (including expensive PIAA H1 bulbs) with the exception of Sylvania Silverstar bulbs. Unlike the Silverstar bulbs, however, they last a long time and they don't cost a fortune."
5,So far so good,"These have only been in the car for about 3 months now, but I have no complaints. They seem reasonably bright -- maybe not as bright as some Xtravision lamps they replaced, but the Xtravision's didn't last long."
3,So so,Bought this becasue I heard a couple good songs....and that's all there is...a couple good songs. The message is good but the music many times is like bad pop hair band.
2,"Mediocre quality; good to learn, bad to use","A little difficult to use, seems to make my images rather soft. I wasn't expecting the greatest quality at this price point, and was mostly looking to just experiment with a CPL before I commit to buying a more expensive one. That's about all this has been good for.Probably a good choice for beginners, or people like myself who want to see what effect a CPL will truly have on your photos. Not a good option if you're looking for a high quality filter."
2,Piece of junk,"Shotty constuction. You get what you pay for. The glass is to small for the ring, and you can actually see the edge of the glass at times. The retainer ring isn't sized right either, it screws in cocked instead of flush. Opticaly it works fine and I will use it till I can get a good multi-coated Hoya or B+W"
1,No Likee,"I found the writing banal and loaded with lots of just ""filler"". Totally bored, I am very doubtful about spending money and time on another Susan Wiggs book. OK, not everyone can write like Anne Siddons. What a pity...."
4,enjoyable read,I like Susan Wiggs' characters and although most of the stories are precitable they make for a nice read. The Ocean Between Us is still my favorite book of hers.
4,Table for Five by Susan Wiggs,A very heartwarming story....light reading .... but the plot was very believable and kept me interested all the way through. Well written....such that I shall look for other Susan Wiggs stories for my Kindle !
4,Table for Five,"I Enjoyed the book after I got past the sad part, and then I reall got into it. I like some of her other books better, but still a good book, and I have passed mine on to a friend to read."
5,Riveting,She is a good author and this story was very easy reading and good!It leaves you in a good place.I highly recommend it. Good feeling.
5,A good desk reference.,"This book has a lot of good and useful information right at your finger-tips. I would suggest this book to anyone in the transcription feild. This book has sample reports, do's and don'ts to follow, terminology, medications, ect. The book is fast and efficient!"
3,Very cute,"I got this for my daughter so it would help her situp. It isn't as sturdy as a boppy pillow, so it didn't work as well as I had planned. It doesn't really hold her attention for very long."
1,Expensive rubbish - waste of money !,"We recently ordered Dino for our 6 month old son, thinking we could use it initially to help him sit up and then later as a fun rough-and-tumble toy. What arrived was a small overstuffed sock with a few ""crinkly"" spines. The quality of the material was cheap and nasty and the construction is appauling. As for the ""roar"" of the nose - we could barely hear a squeak. Needless to say, we returned this ""toy"" immediately. Don't waste your money - a pillow with a decorative face would be just as good and at least the cover would be washable ! AWFUL !!!!!"
4,Microbiology an introduction,Delivered effectively and quickly. Only the edges were a little dammaged and I don't remember reading about that. Otherwise I am very well satisfied
2,A lot of information....disorganized,"I taught a basic undergraduate microbiology class using this text book. The students were mostly pre-nursing so we had a clinical focus. My main problem with the text is it is trying to be all things to all people. It tries to present too much information that is scattered all over the text. Frequently, within chapters, students have to jump back and forth to material presented in other chapters and it simply becomes information overload. In addition, some of the study question, especially the clinically oriented ones, ask the students about areas that haven't been adequately covered in the text or assume knowledge that they don't have as yet. Finally, beware the Powerpoint slide presentations. These are also full of errors and need pretty extensive editing."
3,recieved in great time but no cd rom,recieved quickly but no cd rom was attached I may have missed it in the description though but I don't believe it stated no cd
2,Wha?,"I'm a 63 year old woman. Never, in all those years have I come across female sexuality even vaguely like those drawn by O'Hara in this character study.Even Yanks twisted attraction to the lady who runs the boarding house was so utterly otherworldly - that I began to shake my head.Yank's indifferent sexuality and appetite became more and more surreal as the story moved on.I don't think O'Hara knew what to do with this tale. I think this was a case of a short story that he put down after the escape to Vermont - Perhaps O'Hara needed some quick cash, so he dug up an old story line - and fed it to is publisher.Very very disconnected and strange characters. I've never met a living soul like any of the people in this novel AFTER New York.We've all been played for chumps with this one."
3,Okay,"It's ok, my son is 6, he likes it ok but doesn't want to read it that often. If you like space then this is a good early reader."
2,Second Time 'Round... This Game Is Corney,"(...) Well this game (stinks)!!! How came EA Sports make good games like Madden and NHL but then come out wit (something) like this?? The graphics are whack, and the gamplay... well I ain't gon say nothin bout them, you can't even control crossovers. When people dunk them don't even touch the rim. My suggestion to you is if you want a basketball game get NBA 2k2, or you can (...) get Street Hoops."
1,A big let down :(,"I bought the game today and am sorry to say im very dissappointed,i never played the first one for the ps2 because i just got one,but the game is terrible,bank shot 3 pointers,weak layups,horrendous offensive rebounding glitch,i actually shot the ball 12 times and kept getting my own rebound,horrible...graphics look semi decent,the spin move while posting is very hard to control,i can go on and on about this let down,im a huge basketball fan and was looking forward to playing this for a whole year.....do yourselves a favor..DONT buy it,looks like im going to have to try nba2k2 for the DC"
3,Why no dunk contest?,"I would have gave it an 5, but it had no slam dunk contest. It should've. It would've made the game more tyte. And you should add more assesories to the create player section."
2,Telling you how it is.,"The game developers obviously needed more time for this game. In my opinion, you should hold off till next year before you invest in this very average game (average in all respects). SEGA makes a far superior game (NBA2k2) also available for the ps2, buy that one if you're in a rush to beat your roommates."
2,So So Hoop Game,"It has good graphics, but you can't rebound. Also, it doesn't have all of the rookies on it. No Tyson Chandler or Eddie Curry. Which personally I think it is cooler if every player is on the game. I would rent it but I wouldn't buy it."
2,ahh hello,Sorry to say but EA really blew out a bad one to hit the xmas deadline. I was one of the unfortunate few who bought this POS and have to stick with it because I do not currently live in the states and so can not get rid of it. All the other reviews are head on with this game. The rebounding problem is horrendous although I believe there is a worse flaw. EA had the bright idea of allowing the gamer to adjust the skills of current players which in turn can make people like Kwame Brown better than C. Webb. The obvious logic solution would be not to adjust the character stats but much like the forbidden fruit. If it's there most of us will do it even though we know to our fullest knowledge that it would ruin the game. I normally do not write reviews and stuff but I had the obligation to the mass public to warn them off of this attrosity. Oh well. Maybe EA will read this and get the hint....peace everyone
2,don't believe the hype,"I am an old school gamer,dating back to 1991.I have basically played all of the easports,sporting games.This game by far is the worst i have ever seen,especially after having played MADDEN 2002.I found this version to be very slow and boring.What's with all the rim shots?Can anybody sink an all net shot?Eventhough the graphics are much more defined, they still have that polygon look to them.The dunks are effortless,and i found it very easy to move around the opponents,who seem to stand around until you move their way.Overall the game is a little on the weak side when compared to the great ""nba lives"" of the past.The kids will love it, but true ballers know there is a lot more they could have done with this version.Hopefully,the programmers will do a better job with 2003. PRAY!!!"
1,EA rushed this one out,"There are a ton of bugs in this game, do not buy. you are much better off going with NBA Street. EA rushed this out the door, the gameplay has gotten worse than in previous years. Skip it!"
3,What happened?,"Well, another one bites the dust. The game overall is not too terrible, it's just that after you play it, you are left ambivalent. Sure there are some nice graphics but they're not that great, the commentary is trully bad, and the gameplay is ho-hum. The game never really gives you an adrenaline rush or the excitement of having made the killer pass or shot. Just average, rental only."
2,Not worth renting,I rented it and it is no better than last years which stinks. I am about ready to give up on there ever being a good NBA BBall game besides NBA Street which is not even 5 vs 5. Don't waste your money on this.
4,Basketball Funfair,"Despite all the criticism this game has been having, it is actually a very fun game to play. It is not supposed to be perfect, but fun. And it delivers that. Graphics are very good, controls too and the only downpoint to me is that the cpu loves to cheat, like in all bball games so far."
2,Dissapointed,"I saw the comercial for this game and immediately wanted to try. So I rented it. It is very boring. You can never shake the defenders, when you spin you spin right into the defender. They need to seperate the good players from the bad players too because it almost seems they all have the same skills. When your on defense you can never get a rebound, but when your on offense you can always get a rebound. If you want a real basketball game don't buy this. You will have to wait until PS2 makes a new one."
3,EA Sports can do alot better.,"When i bought the new installment of NBA Live for the PS2, i was expecting it to be a good game, but to my dissatifaction its' not what i expected. The camera angles aren't that great, the commentating blows and the gameplay is ok at best. Graphically the game is on point, however graphics alone cannot make a good game. My first basketball experience was NBA 2K following NBA 2K1 on DC, perhaps that's what im used to. In terms of a complete basketball game in my opinion NBA Live lacks it, i personally am waiting for the NBA2K2 to come for the PS2 next year--> thats what a basketball should be."
2,Live 2002 ain't nuthin',"EA sports said this was gonna be a improved sequal. As far as I'm concernd, this game is bull...!How come the center scores the most?(Like Shaq scores 93 points, and Kobe only scores about 12 or 14 in a 48 minute game) And Why when you're ahead by 21, the other team comes back like its nothin'?! And the other team steals the ball way too much. It also seems the other team keeps gettin' offensive rebounds, 'till they get there way. If I were u don't waste money on a piece...like this. The only thing good about it is it will keep ya entertaind when u board ....Git 2001 it was better."
2,Same as NBAL2001,"*I have this game for PSOne but I think that they're both the same*. Any way the game play is good and all and I am a diehard EA fan but this game is EXACTLY like NBA Live 2001. The only thing different is the soundtrack and the rosters. If you want to see what kind of game this is from me, go look up a review for NBA Live 2001. I assure you that will be a good one"
2,This game (...)! Period.,"After all of the hype that came before the game was released I would expect much better game play. I was very disappointed after playing this game especially after going through what I did to purchase it. The defensive rebounding in this game is terrible I mean it's almost imposible grab a board. Then players run up and down the court at 100mph wich is (INSANE) the best feature about this game is no doubt, the replays. If the whole game looked like the replays I would not sitting here typing. The players don't even look like themselves, they could have done a whole lot better. I am now looking forward to NBA 2K2 which will be released in Feb.2002 I know for a fact this game will be 10 no 100 times better. For the record I will NEVER buy NBA Live again."
2,So sad. this game eats.,"i am a huge fan of the EA NBA Live series. I was so excited to get this game, and i am so bitter now that i plunked down 50 bucks on it.1) The game play is SLOW. painfully slow. I know they go for realism but this is ridiculous.2) The game is no fun. Perhaps i missed it but they took all the superfun options out of this game. You can't make custom teams. My friends and I used to make fantasy teams of our favorite NBA players or of us and play them in exhibition mode. You cannot do this in Live 2002. You also cannot unlock legends and put them on your teams.And instead of all this fun, there is the franchise mode. The franchise mode is the stupidest sports game innovation ever.So if you love EA basketball, DON'T BUY THIS GAME. Buy Live 2000 for the PSX 1. Live 2002 looks better and has cooler moves but is much slower and nowhere near as fun."
2,not good,"i own many EA basketball games including NBA 2001 for PS2, which was very bad. i was expecting NBA 2002 to be at least a little better, but was disappointed for the most part. First of all, the graphics are an improvement, but not much of one. second, there are a couple of flaws which are really annoying. I see that they have been discussed in previous reviews. A couple of extra things I found annoying about 2002: when one of my players picks up a foul it's really hard to substitute before the other team passes the ball in, so i get players fouling out when i'm trying to get them out of the game. Why cant they just let us choose our subs during gameplay, and then let them come in at the next dead ball? Also, the soundtrack is pretty annoying and the commentary is downright terrible."
3,For it's time it was great,"For it's time, this game was good, but it doesn't have the dunk contest and extra features that the newer games have. The actual gameplay is perfect (I hate how the buttons are on the newer games)."
2,Not Challeneging Enough,"Look, I could write a nice, long review on what I don't like about this game, but I just think I'll get right to the point. The game is too simple. First time I played the game, I set it to the highest level, just to see what it was like...and guess what? I beat it. And for those of you out there, thinking I'm some great, hardcore gamer, I'll have to tell you I'm not. I play my Playstation 2 only around an hour a weak and I'm not that great. I played this game about 2 weeks before I put it away for good. So if a really bad gamer who wants to play this game with a friend, it might be okay, but for the rest of you, I'd look for a different basketball game (perhaps NBA 2k2)."
2,Great potential but a little dull,Easy playability and decent graphics make this game excellent fun for the first couple of minutes. The players` likenesses are amazing and their body movements are highly realistic. Unfortunately it`s way too slow and bears little resemblance to an actual game of basketball. The centers dominate the play too much. Players like Shaq pick up the MVP award every game because they are totally dominant offensively and defensively. Offensive rebounding is a little too easy and this detracts from the realism of the game.DON`T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2,OK at Best!,"This game was indeed a big dissapointment. What I find the most annoying is the lack of defense (can burn any defender at any level), to easy to steal, jump shots are nearly nonexistent (you have to be almost completely open to hit one) and to easy to score on the drive. Apart from that, the one on one is pretty cool and the graphics are improved, but Dreamcast's 2K1 is still better. I'm going to auction of this piece of (...), don't waste your money."
2,NBA Live 2002 still has some work to be done,"I purchased Live 2001, and was not impressed with it, so I thought I would give EA Sports another shot, so I purchased Live 2002 and while its an improvement over 2001, there are still some things that need to be addressed. Gameplay is one, and rebounding...etc I can go on and on. It's time for a change so, I already have NBA 2K2 on order, so I guess we will see who is the best once and for all!!!"
4,A Great Improvement,"I just got done playing my first game for NBA Live 2002. I can say it was definately worth paying the $50 for, but there could be a few improvements. Superstar level is really really tough and the sound effects could be improved a little bit. It could be a little bit smoother like NBA Street was. The announcers are still a little dry--it could be time for a couple of different people to call the games. Other than those few things, everything else is great. The game play is smooth and the graphics are unreal. I do suggest that any sports fan with a PS2 or X Box should make this a part of their collection."
3,Hopefully an improvement.,The first EA NBA release for the PS2 was a real disappointment I think to most people. Let's hope EA got their act together for this followup.FOLLOWUP TO ABOVE: What I was hoping for did not happen. NBA Live was one of the best titles on other consoles but for some reason EA is not getting right on the PS2. Wait for NBA2K2 instead.
2,What kind of game is this?,"First of all I would like to say big-ups to nba 2k2. Now back to live I DON'T like this game at all,1. Do the same dunks over and over.2. Can't hit nothing frome the outside.3. No headbands when you create a player.4. Graphics are horrible.5. I was shock when I Played this.6. I still like ea sports."
3,OK,"Im a 14 year old and my grandparents gave me a $50 toys r us gift certificate for Christmas and i got NBA Live 2002 with it. When I started playing the game at first it was a lot of fun. I didn't like the way the camera changes direction whenever you get or lose the ball but other than that I enjoyed it. Then back at the start up screen I looked for where to go to pick your own custom team. I couldn't find it. I looked in the manuel and reilized that they had gotten rid of my favorite feature of NBA Live. I also own NBA live 2000 for the original playstation and the only thing me, my brother and my friends would ever do on it was draft our own custom teams and play with them in expansion mode. I never did a season and now they have franchise mode which is essentially the same thing. The bottom line is, the gameplay is good but because it doesn't have a custom draft, i give it 3 stars."
2,BOOOOORING,"For a while I thought it was just me but after reading other reviews on here this game is pretty bad. Its very slow which is very annoying. Even when I use the turbo button the players still run slow. your opponent is going to get at least 3-4 shot attempts each time down the court. After playing it 10-15 times it also got very boring to play. Now it sits collecting dust, I guess I will dust it off and trade it in for NBA 2k2. I have been a NBA live user since it 1st came out and the game has seem to have gotten worse the past 3yrs. They dont even keep track of player points and rebounds anymore during the game which was available when you took free throw attempts. BOOOOORING"
1,Nba live vs. Nba 2k2 (no contest),I have seen a lot better basketball games from EA sports. I have played this game and cant find 1 good thing about it. The camera angles are just plain horrible whilethe gameplay is just as bad.Every shot you take is a rim ball. No swishes or shots off the backboard. I dont know about you but ill wait till nba 2k2 comes out in February. EA sports should be ashamed of themslves.
2,NBA LIVE2002 A LET DOWN,"I was expecting a major upgrade over last year's game, but EA sports turned the ball over. Although it is not a terrible game it just didn't put forth any thing new or exciting. Rebounding and camera issues are the two biggest areas of concern. Why these were not addressed before the game was released, indicates to me that EA sports just didn't care to expend any extra effort to improve game play. Madden 2002 is an excellent sports game and it is hard to believe that EA sports roster would have a weak entry, like this in it's starting line up."
3,why no slam dunk contest & assesories?,De game would have been more tyte if u put an slam dunk contest and you should've added more assesories to the create player section. If you make a 2004 you should add this all.
2,Less than immediate satisfaction,"If you are looking for stencils to utilize immediately, this book is not a good choice. Its more like a sourcebook than images in 'Look Inside' appear. There aren't any useable stencils in the book and the intricate detail would require many, many hours of stencil cutting with a regular stencil cutter. I'm going to invest in a Cri-cut type of electric cutter - now that I have this book. As you might have caught on by those words, this book either leads to an investment of time or a cutting machine. Needless to say, my Goodwill purchased armoire is still unpainted.The designs and images in the book are inspirational, though, and quite lovely; but honestly there are sourcebook with Japanese designs that offer more choices and more variety. If the book had been labeled a sourcebook, I wouldn't have bought it and since it was titled as stencils, I was disappointed. Not a best choice for a home painting project, definately not."
5,fex-all,I will buy again in the future.I will not trust no other name brand beside fexall.Best product ever fast pain relief
5,"A great, tough toy!","The Pet Buddies Pooch Tube is a wonderful toy for retriever types, and dogs that love to just run around with something in their mouth. It's almost indestructible - at least two Irish Setters have given it their best effort. They can actually be found in snow and grass, float in the water, and will sail in a predictable direction when hurled.I would strongly suggest these be bought in pairs, of different colors - it will become a favorite, and it's excruciating when they are left behind at the vacation home, or in the other vehicle that just left for work. It is also advisable if you have one of those dogs that like to go get the toy, but will then play keepaway - you will have another to barter with.They are not for every dog - no toy seems to ever fit that bill- but they are perfect for those long legged bird dogs for which other toys seem like trinkets to be gutted and distributed around the rug. These really hold up!"
4,Superman Costumer (Toddler),This was purchased for my 2 year old son's Halloween costume this year. The product is high quality and the shipping was fast.We like it!
3,Superman outfit,"The outfit is cute but it is way, way too big. So far he has not worn it but likes to look at it. I would not buy this again."
2,Poor quality,"I bought this for my son who is 3. The size is 2T/4T. The sizing was fine, it was a little big, but I expected that. However, before I could even get the cape on him the velcro came unstitched and now I'll have to sew it back on before he can wear it. It also has a hole in the seam around the neck. I bought this brand new and am very disappointed in the quality of the product. Would NOT buy again."
4,Worth Every Penny!,"My 3 year old son absolutely loved this costume. He just turned three and is tall and thin and this fit him perfectly. The costume looks great, but unfortunately the quality is a little on the low end . . . I had to cut off about 20 stray threads in the first couple of times he wore it. Even still, I would absolutely buy this product again. My son had the time of his life pretending he was superman."
3,Terrible quality,"I ordered this for my son who is obsessed with Superman. We received the first costume and there were so many loose strings/stitching that was not done properly, I had to return and request a new costume. Amazon was great in responding quickly to this request. The new costume arrived and while it was better, there are still loose stitches/overdone stitching. The cape is already completely unraveled at the top (after 4 days). Terrible quality. I also ordered a Batman costume for my other son--the same manufacturer--that costume is in great shape. Not sure what the story is, but 2 bad costumes in a row lead me to believe that they have issues in the factory!"
5,Great costume!,"My son loved this costume for Halloween! The sizing was accurate and the fake muscles were great! This costume ""super""! :)"
2,My son loves it but its terrible quality,I've had the costume for less than 48 hours and I noticed the belt is already torn. I won't send back because my son LOVES it regardless but I probably won't buy a costume from this company again!
2,flat and cardboard-like chest,"Chest area is flat, no muscles, and it feels cardboard-like. It is made from a tough plastic that is ok for adults but not for the children who want to wear it all day long. There are no boots only boot look alike extensions on the pants."
2,we're so upset,"i ordered it for my 5 years old son and we did not get it. he was so upset. too much trouble to find out, i think i will not order costume from rubies again"
4,Decent Superman Costume,This size was true to fit. My son loved it and continues to use the cape which is durable. Delivery was fast and it is better than the superman costume without the muscles.
4,Superman!,My little one absolutely loved this costume for Halloween.Only drawback was the velcro on the cape. It fastens right at the front of my son's neck and after a few minutes he was taking the cape off.Otherwise its a lot of fun and something he will wear long after Halloween.
3,Bulbs,I kind of like these bulbs they are like the Savina silver star but they dot last long. They are not as bright as Silver stars.
2,APC headlights,"Cheap fix for blown headlights. They do have a white look, but they're no brighter than any factory bulb. I put these in a 92' corolla, and the factorys where brighter, which is pretty sad."
1,Sent me the WRONG BOX!!,"My daughter has her first loose tooth, and so I ordered this box for her. When it arrive, I was upset to see they had sent me THE WRONG BOX. I received a treasure/jewlery box instead of the tooth fairy box. My daughter is delighted, and loves the new box, but it is NOT what I ordered. DO NOT ORDER FROM REEVES (BREYER) INT'L if you want to get what you order."
2,Where are all the national geographic adventures?,"This book focuses a lot on the founding family and its power struggles thorughout the generations leading National Geographic, and touches the great explorers and their adventures in a very shallow fashion.I would have loved to have more details about the funded adventurers rather than have pages of nervous breakdowns and conflicts of the Bell and Grosvenor family."
1,No Drivers Available,"I was shocked when finding that the drivers supplied with this card are NOT Pocket PC 2003 compatible. Hawking told me that these drivers would not be available util ""sometime in 2004""."
4,Is very good to use in traffic,"I want to say this is a excellent product to use in car for traffic, it's help me a lot with the pronunciation and the listener, knowing many words I'm now contruction my phrases to talk easy. This system has a remember voice to use in many places to talk. It's excellent and the price too."
4,Good companion for learning French,"I put this in my car and listen to the lessons over and over. I often run into words that I dont know, so I am thankful there is a little book for each level which shows the text. If you leave it in your car, and you drive alone,you can repeat the sentences as much as you like without bothering anyone else."
4,learn a language the easy way,"Great way to learn a language, although the way this program teaches is a bit boring, so if you need visual stimulation to learn a language this probably isn't the right product for you. I'm really happy with it though."
3,Good Purchase,I have taken a few French classes and this was a fun easy refresher to teach and go over the basics in spoken French language. It also helps refine pronunciation and was exactly what I was looking for. It might be a little challenging for someone with no experience at all in the language.
2,NOT for learning in your car,"I have bought several books and CDs to learn and practice my French. I found this collection to be the worst. There is NO conversation. Words are repeated (TWICE) so that you have to memorize them. Simple phrases don't even start until Lesson 26. I found it impossible to listen to this in my car, since I couldn't stop or rewind quickly enough to hear the words again to repeat them. This was a waste of $$."
4,Great fun and learning a lot,"I ordered this product to teach my kids French. It works great. Everytime we are in the car, I put them in and I notice they pick up a lot. Especially the prononciation improves a lot since they hear it all the time. Great product !"
3,Good review material.,"This has been a good refresher of the French lessons I took years ago. One complaint, though. The second CD in the third level of the course is a copy of the third CD for that level, with the 2 of 3 label."
2,choose something else,"If you are already fluent in French you will still have trouble with this course, don't waste your money."
5,Pretty great stuff!,"To be quite frank, Tylenol doesn't usually work for me - it's almost like taking a sugar pill. But, since they've come out with these extra strength pills, they do a very nice job on the headaches. I normally use Advil but needed to change with a pregnancy and was afraid nothing else would work. This Tylenol really did the job on a flu-type headache and on caffeine-headaches. Now that's hard to beat. Anyone who's gone on caffeine withdrawal KNOWS what type of headache that is and these really took care of that. I'm sure glad I found these!"
3,Big Latiny-tribally-summery grooves,"Proof that when music is released may be just as important as the tunes themselves, DJ Debra drops Wildlife right at the start of spring, an ideal backdrop for all these big Latiny-tribally-summery grooves. Cue those picnics, outdoor parties, and fire up quality percussive licks to back them, from the simple (Montero ""Parana"", Souldoubt ""Bambu Stick"", Dr. Kucho ""House Music"") to the festive, with additional horn bursts via Gordon Edge's ""One Trial"" and Noel Nanton's ""Your Love"" for spicing.On occasion the beats get lost in the shuffle, notably when Debra's own ""My Bizznizz"" and Hipp-e & Dizzy's ""City Dues"" choose to belt out speeches instead of just letting the music speak. But overall, as the deep bass, relaxed pace charmer ""Iberican Vibes"" commands, this is a vibrant way to clear your mind and enjoy a soundtrack to the season."
4,better than the doodle pro,"We have both the magna doodle and the doodle pro, and the magna doodle writing seems to be much clearer and it is holding up much better than the doodle pro"
4,Teacher recommends,One of my collegues suggested using this to teach phonics. It's been working great. Kids really like to erase and change vowel sounds and it certainly keeps them interested (more fun than pencil and paper) Try having your child write their spelling words on it!
4,Great Food for Thought,"A collection of papers from a seminar on the role of culture in major disasters and their aftermath, as seen through the prism of anthropology, this book offers great insights into the playing out of a community's response to both natural and man-made catastrophes. While neither New Orleans nor the recent Japanese crisis are mentioned, it seemed to explain a great deal of what happened in those more recent instances. I would have given this book five stars were it not for the fact that the academic language of some papers may prove difficult for non-academic readers, but with patience, it is well worth making the effort."
2,A mere slice of Melmoth the Wanderer.,"This is not a complete edition of the gothic tale, Melmoth The Wanderer.It is a condensed, abridged and truncated version of the first few chapters. The prose has been grossly abridged. Description that enhanced Melmoth's desperate search for salvation has been cut, and the dialogue has been simplified, basically dumbed down for the modern reader. Thanks, but no thanks. The original tale has 39 chapters of tales within tales, so this e-book is a great disappointment.One redeeming quality; it does include a translation of Balzac's short story, Melmoth Reconciled. I would recommend this e-book for that story alone. As for Melmoth the Wanderer, I would recommend waiting for ane-edition of Maturin's original manuscript."
4,scarier than any horror movie......,"they say that true horror is in the world we live in, and this movie lives up to that saying. no movie, not the exorcist, rosemary's baby, or any classic horror movie, can prepare you for the thought that what is shown here can be your future. i saw this movie back in the mid-80s when he said that these things were yet to happen. I'm glad to know his predictions were off, but back then, nostradamus gave me countless nightmares......."
4,SEPTEMBER 11TH 2001,BUY THIS MOVIE...in light of the tragic events on the date of this review...this movie just became prophecy....i just lost my breath watching our great nation come to terms with terrorism...and it is played out in this movie in fearsome detail.20 years after the film was made and almost exactly when Nostradamus said it would actually happen.
1,what did the movie predict?,"is it true there was a scene in the film that showed the twin towers toppling? also, did the film indeed make reference to ""twin brothers"" or is that merely a fabrication circulating the 'net?"
4,Dad Loves IT!,"My father has been looking for the movie for years. When it arrived, it made him the happiest person on earth. He says that the movie is GREAT! He is amazed at how much Nostrodomus knew about the future and how he could name names and places. Dad gives ig 4 stars!"
4,The Man Who Saw Tomorrow,Great film and I recommend that everyone should watch this movie. It is absolutely amazing to me that he was so on the mark with so many predictions for so many years.Wonderful and so glad I finally got a copy for my collection.Thanks Amazon.
5,This movie will chase you forever,"The pbm with that movie, is that once you watched you cannot escape from it and forget it. You always keep recalling the different events, comparing them with the world events to see it the predictions are true. even if sometimes they do not become true ""thanks God"" you keep saying, may be the predictions are only being delayed for a year or two. The amazing thing is that many of us do beleive a third war is quite possible, and i guess it is because today we are no more fair to each otheres that this become natural results of our behaviour. The movie somehow illustrate the end results without going into the reasons.Great movie and brilliant presentation from Orson Welles"
2,Hope all his future prdications never become true,Hope all of his predictions on our coming future never become true. May God Bless this World and its Living Beings.
2,Part docu-drama - bleak interpretations of Notradamus,"The best part of the movie is the drama that Orsen Welles brings as narrator. Bleak look at future and current events that lead to world destruction. Nostradamus' prophecies are interpreted to match world situation. Interesting though - if you are interested in Nostradamus, you should watch."
1,Prophecies are mixed and matched to scare viewers,"Most of the prophecies are pretty accurate up until the ones about the third antichrist. ""Accurate"" meaning that their interpretations of the original quatrains are reasonable.The prophecies surrounding the third antichrist are completely bogus, though. I wrote down the prophecies word for word, then looked in a 30 year old book with all his original prophecies, with English translation, in them. Literally, the movie takes one line from one section, another line from another, and so on.They then present these randomly assembled lines as if it were one prophecy, which is completey misleading.Don't be scared by this movie, it plays on your trust and your fears."
3,No title track,"How can you have a soundtrack and not have the title track? Lots of fine music, but I wanted that inspiring title song. That's the track I can't get anywhere else. Disappointed."
2,No title track?,This is fairly easy to review: the only reason i bought this cd was to get the main title track that we hear from the show/dvd! ... how can you not put the title track on the affiliated soundtrack? I think they just picked songs at random to put on this cd...
2,Limited and overpriced,"They rode around the world for over three months, listening to numerous tracks of music, and this is all the company could put on a souudtrack? It IS NOT worth the price, save your money. Also, as everyone else has said, it lacks the title track. Buy the soundtrack for ""Long Way Down"" directly from the web site [...] and you will be very pleased; it has the title track and lots of great music from the ride."
2,where`s the title track,this last summer I rode my R1100 GS through all the atlantic provinces of canada inspired by not just the trip {an amazing journey} but the tune .that tune echoed through my head the whole 19 day`s and I`m very disapointed that it`s` not included
3,Long Way Round CD,The sound quality of this CD is not all that great but most of the songs are pretty cool.
3,Takes 16 minutes to Read (3.5 stars),"As a huge fan of Kid Koala and as a huge fan of graphic novels I was really looking forward to this. Before i got it I noticed it kept on being stressed in press that it was 300 pages long. I now know that that seems to be an attempt to cover up the fact that it literally takes 16 minutes to read (the accompanying CD is 16 minutes long). Why so short? because there are almost no words, a ""silent movie"" of sorts.With that said the novel is still quite good. There are lots of moments that are quite touching, and you actually care for the charectors by the end (remarkable given no dialogue, and the quickness of the story).One Technical Complaint is that Kid should have put the page numbers for each song on something other than the actual CD. Because in order to know when to play certain songs i need to look at the actual CD, and stop my cd player.All in all I really enjoyed Nufonia. Just be forewarned that it is short."
5,ah THIS WAS GREAT,"wow, without doubt this silent graphic novel is one of the best. it's so touching. after reading it, i really wanted to cry, i felt so bad for the robot. it's lack of words only makes it better. i haven't actually listened to the CD (me and my friend read the entire thing, in Towers, we were so enraptured), but im sure that's great too. and though its a quick read the first time around, you should go back and re look at it. it took me and my friend two times to comprehend the utter briliance of this. ah, wow, i'm in awe :D."
5,"Vitamin ""C"" substitute","If you've had a problem when trying to take a high dose of vitamin ""C"" because of stomach problems with all the acid from ""C"", this is an excellent alternative. It it made buy a trustworthy supplement manufacturer and, from me checking alternative products, is fairly priced."
1,Awful,"Turn to any page in this translation and witness the poor grammar, confusing sentence structure, and words that aren't even English. This is a translation that went from French to Spanish, then Spanish to English, and as a practical or academic text it is completely incomprehensible."
1,Unfortunate Translation,"Collection of Selected Prayers is such an important and useful book...in its Spanish version. Unfortunately, the English translation, though well-intended, it absolutely hideous. In fact, it's so poor as to be almost incomprehensible. This is a good project for a translator with greater skill than is reflected in this title."
5,Fun Toy,"My son loves this toy. He caught on very quickly... how to push the people down and have them pop up. He plays with this toy a lot. It is simple, yet engaging."
1,Paint chips,"It is unfortunate that I am forced to give this toy a one-star review - after all, it provided great entertainment for my baby until I realized that the paint on the little pop up sticks was chipping off into his mouth. This happened the first time my son played with this toy, and within 2-3 minutes there were paint chips on his face and in his mouth. I will not be letting him play with this again. Let's face it, this is a toy for babies (12 months and up), and babies put everything in their mouths. With all of the worry regarding lead-infused children's toys, you would think that Galt would construct a better product. I have attempted to contact the manufacturer, but haven't been successful. I felt compelled to review this toy to warn other parents considering purchasing it for their babies."
2,Sadly the paint chips,I bought this to give to a 1-year old. Unfortunately the paint was already chipping on the green-colored pop-up when I received it. It is too bad because I am very partial to wood toys and this one gets such high marks in its use for teaching hand/eye coordination....
4,Fun,"I purchased this for my son who is currently 11 months old... Right now he doesn't really know what to make of it and just blinks rapidly when the little figures pop out of the base... I can totally see him growing into this though since I find it amusing myself. It is such a nice, simple little toy. I hate all of the plastic junk that is out there and appreciate that it is made out of wood. No chipping paint yet as others have experienced. It is priced well to give it a try to see if you and your children like it for yourselves..."
4,Hours of entertainment!,I bought this toy to use with children as young as 18 months. It keeps them entertained for a short period of time and they always seem to laugh at the silly sounds I make. My husband was so excited when I showed him how it worked that I ended up buying one for him to bring into his office. Great for any age!!
5,GREAT BOOK,"What I like the most about this book (and the others in the series) is that it is accurate without too much BS.If you want the inside track on where to camp, exact sites etc, this book is it, well worth the money."
5,Replacement Heads,"Exactly as described, fits perfectly. Like buying a new razor for one-third of the cost."
4,Just like new again.,I have had the Remington R-600 razor for around 7 or 8 years and this is the second time I have chnged the blades. Now it is just like new again.Very easy to install and easy to clean.
3,Good points and bad points,"This Belly Dance video is higher quality than most. A lot of effort was put into it. The different dancers show what the moves look like on different people. However, Atea does not look comfortable with herself on camera. (I have never seen her live.) Her movements are stiff. Good for a begginer."
2,Extremely basic,"If you've taken any bellydance classes at all, pass on this video. If you're interested in learning the minimum basics, then you may enjoy it. I found this video boring and after only six months of classes, I was far advanced for it. If you're a dancer with a desire to supplement your class time with videos, this is not a good choice. I think this video is for individuals with no opportunity to take classes locally and are brand spanking new to the world of belldance. And even then, there are better choices out there."
3,"Some Good, Some Not-So-Good","I enjoy working with the movements on this tape, and I find it very helpful, but it is not without flaws. Atea is fairly stiff when she isn't dancing; she doesn't appear comfortable in front of the camera. The instructional sequences move far too quickly for me. Do your warmups beforehand because you're not given sufficient time in the tape. I often felt like I had just gotten comfortable with a sequence when we moved on to another dance move (but I *am* a slow learner). The performance parts of the tape are good; they give me something to aspire to! Great music and gorgeous (and numerous) costumes."
5,Music with a Message,"I have all four of their CDs and love them all. Often you buy a CD, and youlike only a couple of the songs, but that's not the case here. Their lyricsreflect true life experiences performed by talented musicians who clearlyenunciate their message. Whether it's humorous such as trying to find aperfect pair of sunglasses (on their ""Asphalt"" CD) or political such asUS Foreign Policy on this CD, Mike and Katie will make you laugh andthink at the same time you're stomping your feet and having a really goodtime. Just plain great music."
3,ASP ELITE ASPEN,"This [light] really works, bright light too, we have had one for about 3 years, and it still puts out light."
5,Microlight,Love the light...very powerful for its size. We use it for camping or overnights in strange places when we are not sure where the bathroom is. Easy to pack and transport with you.
5,Fast Delivery,Even with standard usps delivery I received this product in a few days instead of a few weeks.
4,Jolly good fun,"My new Mega Missile Launcher worked perfectly out of the box and provides good fun chasing our dogs around and firing foam projectiles for the cats to pounce on.It runs well on carpet, but not well at all on polished wood floors; it's okay on tile and linoleum. The battery takes 3.5-4 hours to recharge for only 20 minutes run time in the launcher unit, which is the biggest reason for the 4-star rating.The other is that the missile reserve elevates by remote control, but must be lowered by hand. That's not a big deal, but if you want to put it down for fast travel (when it can wobble some) it cannot be done by remote.Overall this is fun toy! Now, where did the dog go...?"
4,Great Card for windows not so much for linux,"This card works great with a windows computer, but if your using linux go with another card."
3,Works up to 30 miles.,Works good on higher uhf channels if you're within about 30 miles of the broadcast tower. Has a hard time with the lower vhf channels. The higher you place the antenna the better.
4,Happy with the outcome,I bought the Lacrosse HDTV antenna and was happy with it. I have to compare it with the Phillip's HDtv antenna wich is about the same reception minus two channels... But for the price i would probably stick with the Phillip's antenna.. I could not return the Lacrosse antenna because i already altered (drilled some holes to fit the direct tv base) for the Lacrosse.. Over all i am happy with the Lacrosse antenna.. I had my Phillip's multi directional antenna up in the attic and i had great reception up there so if you want a cheaper product that is about the same outcome then i would buy the Phillips multi directional antenna at Walmart..
3,HD ANTENNA,"It works great. Maybe over-kill on SIZE and Money. I tried a $50 ,shoe box size unit that worked as well,from Home Depot. This was a fair weather comparison, and I have a clear line of sight to broadcast antenna. As I said it works great in all weather and it is big.......I AM UP DATING THIS ITEM..IT IS UHF ONLY!!!When my local staions went back to their original call numbers;the stations below 13 disappeared. Otherwise good antenna."
3,Choose another book if you want to read about Leonardo,"A disappointment. I'm a fan of Penguin Lives series, which, tend to give a somewhat alternative -- and fascinating -- view of their subject. Not so with Nuland's Leonardo. I struggled with Nuland's use of Freud as a reference point for Leonardo, and with his belaboring Leonardo's presumed homosexuality as a reference point for understanding his life. By the time I made it past this, I admit I didn't give Nuland's manuscript my fair attention. And I'm content leaving it that way."
4,Concise but informative look at an amazing man,"Heard the taped version of LEONARDO DA VINCI by SherwinNuland, a concise but informative look at the man who was asuccessful painter, architect, engineer, philosopher, mathematician, and scientist . . . how he accomplished all he did has always amazed me! . . . this book does a good job of helping to explain the basis behind Da Vinci's insatiable curiosity . . . the author, a surgeon and author, also helps explain his subject's longtime fascination with anatomy--first as the basis for his painting and then as the key component in his aim to systematize all knowledge of nature."
2,"Laborious read, focusing mainly on da Vinic's anatomical studies","Armed with a limited understanding of da Vinci's paintings, scientific research and anatomical studies, I picked up this book hoping to gather a better understanding of Leonardo's life and work. Unfortunately, I found this book to be a laborious read, focusing mainly on da Vinic's anatomical studies.I wouldn't say this book is horrible, or that one shouldn't read it. Rather, it's just not the book for you if you desire a more traditional biography. Yet, I'm not certain a traditional biography could exist concerning da Vinci. Large gaps exist in our understanding of him, and much of what we do know is speculative - except where his anatomical work is considered, and which this book mainly covers."
2,Fun but Overpriced,"This is a cool shoe as far as flip-flops go, very comfortable. But they are overpriced. They should cost half of what they cost. I think because they are ""Rebok"", they were pricey, but they are actually just some 7-10 dollar flip-flops. They aren't really sturdy enough to be an everyday sandal type of flip-flop. I use them more just to goof off around the house."
1,Amazon Can't Deliver This Item!,I've been waiting over a month for this item and Amazon is repeatedly delaying my shipment date. The latest email from Amazon states that I won't see the machine for still another month!!! I would order this profiler machine from someone else if you need it in a timley manner. Amazon should update the product listing to represent the expected actual shipping time. This order delay has cost me much more in lost work than what I saved ordering the item through Amazon.
2,MIddle Eastern & European Genealogy: In The Former Ottoman Empire's Records & Online,"I was disappointed when I looked at this book. I expected more information on addresses to where genealogy records could be found in specific countries. Instead it gave basic how to genealogy and talked a lot about genetics (which I did not expect). It basically gave websites to check out ( that I was already farmiliar with) and emails from others stating they were not expert in this field but knew possibly where to find things. It seems to be a referral book of referrals. A beginner may find some of the how to get started information useful. This book will be part of my library, unfortunately I do not think I will be referring to it very much, since I already knew how to look for this information on the internet as mentioned in the book. Perhaps a newbie to the internet would find this book helpful."
1,irritating and slow,"i am greatly disappointed in this software. they privacy protect it so you cannot copy to the hard drive but always have to have the CD in the driver. this makes it slow (even with a pretty fast processor and driver), a battery drain and incredibly irritating. in some cases, words get broken up because it is reading from the driver. i cannot actual evaluate it as a language learning tool because this is so irritating. i wouldn't recommend it.will try and return."
3,Works but...,"I'm not sure what it is about my personal body chemistry, but I am unable to take Dayquil. Whenever I attempt to take it my symptoms will get better, but I'll get such a terrible case of medicine head (lightheaded, unable to focus, disconnected feeling) that sometimes I'll honestly prefer the symptoms of the cold & flu to it. I'm the only one in my family with this response- other people in the house have taken the same medication from the same package & not had any adverse reactions to it.Nyquil on the other hand, I have no problem with. It works great & I usually get a decent night's sleep from it. (Although it does seem to be a light sleep filled with the strangest dreams.) Nyquil is one of my favorite cold & flu medicines for when the symptoms get really bad, as I can rely on it to make me feel better the next morning & help me stay asleep.If you don't have bad reactions to Dayquil, this really is a fantastic combo: both in one package!"
3,Stupid packaging inside,"(subject)Don't they know when people is sick, they don't really have the strength to open the hard packaging inside? Some stupid a$$ pharmaceutical company.Med works though."
5,LOVE THESE!,"These hangers are great. They allow comforters and blankets to be hung neatly in a closet until needed. Saves valuable shelf space and keeps comforters and blankets easily available for use. I cannot imagine EVER being without these. In fact, from now on when I get a new comforter or blanket, I will also purchase one of these hangers."
4,Revolutionary insight into business and technology,"This book provides a clear methodology and framework for integrating technology into core business practices. It is well written and thought provoking. As an executive level technologist, I found this book to contain a great deal of insight into the planning and activities needed to bridge the gap between IT and business."
4,"Excelent choice for the ""E-Business Men"". Good for IT men","If you are looking for an ""e-business technology reference"", this is not the right choice. If you are interested in valuable insight of the E-Business world, you couldn't find a better buy. You'll find many helpful real case studies and a very comprehensive description of this new technologies."
5,Expensive but worth every penny!,"This is a huge work of marketing research, both in terms of volume and importance. Although intended as a grounding in the foundations of market research, the book takes you further than that. As a result I was using it as a text at post-graduate level.The book sets out to explain how to: Formulate your problem. Determine your research design. Design your collection method and forms. Design your sample and collect the data. Analyse and interpret the data. Prepare your research report.It is then subdivided into sub sections. I was particularly impressed with the section on ethics, which was so clearly laid out that I used it as a guide when writing a pure ethics paper.The book is amply supplied with examples and case studies to illustrate the text and make it useful in a more practical sense.All in all a clear, accessible, well laid out and well indexed textbook."
3,Tinny,"These really aren't great speakers, but what do you expect from a 1-1/2 inch cone? They are very compact, inexpensive, and run unamplified or amplified off 4-AA batteries. Good for travelling with a laptop (work dandy with my Powerbook). If you want something for your desktop, look elsewhere."
3,Using the power of one's position,"If Beasts were a movie, it would be rated R, R for raunchy and revealing, and reviling and revenge.The story centers on a young college student who falls in love with her writing professor and his wife. The professor reads poetry from D. H. Lawrence and exhorts his students to go for the jugular, seducing every girl in the class with his voice and his eyes.Gillian, like the others, falls for his charms. When the professor and his wife head off to Europe for Christmas break, Gillian discovers photographs that reveal the identities of others the two have used and discarded. The professor and his wife have wielded the power of their bohemian lifestyle on the innocents of the college to suit their own purposes. Gillian responds with fury and gets her revenge."
4,"A student, a teacher, and a teacher's wife","A delightfully disturbing tale of love and surrender, Beasts is fast paced and unrelenting in its imagery. It is a bold and beautiful book set in the 1970s at a small Massachusetts college for girls.Gillian Brauer is a student eager to improve on her poets' craft but even more eager to please her poetry professor. Andre Harrow is the professor; charming, aloof, and adored by his students. Dorcas is Harrow's mysterious wife whose sculptures are ugly, obscene and altogether provocative.Gillian's childish infatuation with Mr. Harrow leads her into an adult world of erotic passion and as her life becomes entangled in the Harrows' world her own world will be forever changed."
4,delicious morsel of a story,"<i>Beasts</i> is a short, brisk read, but is no longer than it needs to be to tell the story it sets out to tell. Interest in every character is satisfied, and each aspect of the tell is explored in rich detail, with wonderful prose that I hope carries through the next Oates book I pick up (and I hope to pick one up soon). The tale of the insecure college girl seduced into a professor's dark, twisted fantasy world has been explored before, but Ms. Oates performs the investigation with a beautiful, heartbreaking style that I really admire. I regret putting off reading her works for so long!"
3,Adolescent infatuation and sex,"I finally finished a book by Joyce Carol Oates! All attempts at reading her other books failed by the 3rd chapter. This book is short but no brain-buster. Other reviewers tell of the story very well so I leave it to them for the good reviews.Sorry, but I can't appreciate her style of writing or the continuoussexual-obsession which is usually wierd. I hope she is not drawing on personal experiences as a basisfor her plots.Not much suspense and I had no trouble putting the book down to do something else.Borrow it from your library."
4,yet another...,"How many times is this woman going to write the same book? Yes, she's prolific and the book is good but... it's nothing new. You have to enjoy her style and plot-type to enjoy her books because she's incapable of deviating from them even slighly. Neurotic, ""in love"", shy... we've met this girl a few dozen times already in other Oates books and stories. Entertaining, yes, but I'd love for Oates to actually write something new."
2,Thought it would be better,"The best thing about this book was its brevity - only 138 pages long and thankfully so.This is the story of a college student's journey into an obsessive relationship with her professor and his wife.It wasn't very well-written; their relationship was obviously quite intense but the writing was anything but. Written in a different way, this could've been a real page-turner. But it wasn't. It was just lukewarm at best.I wasn't endeared - either positively or negatively - to any of the characters; I felt altogether disconnected from them and the events of the story.The ending was quite good however, so this wasn't a total loss. But I'm not sure I would ever read another of her books (though her writings under the pseudonym of Lauren Kelly are good) and I definitely wouldn't recommend ""Beasts"" to anyone."
4,Recommended reading,"I recommend this short, atmospheric novella. It belongs to what must be a genre: Perversion on Campus. Harkening back to a pre-PC era where predators subtly seduced young, nubile women in a New England campus (Mt Holyoke, no doubt), the plot consists of a disjointed flashback into a post-60s environment very different from our own, when the advocacy of sensual liberation is regarded much less suspiciously than it would today.One particularly effective device is the scrambled ordering of plot events, which is masterful. In fact, the narrative sequencing of events has to be a kind of exemplar for other novelists. Some would say Oates style is overwrought, but if you accept Beasts as a genre novel, then it can be better accepted as highly accomplished and often memorable.So keep in mind the limitations within which Oates works and enjoy!"
2,Tres belle? Quel bagatelle!,"This is a fairly mediocre piece of work...Programmatic [70's style feminist] work, executed in the style of a Radley Metzger film. However, as it is short, the programmatic mediocrity doesn't last long. Mercifully.Of course Oates is (or, was) a much finer writer (& critic--despite her ridiculous misreading of D. H. Lawrence's poetry!) than this work would indicate. It is always disappointing to see such tripe passed off a serious art, when it is in fact brought about by a blatant attempt to cater to a dominant ideology...Like so much Soviet art in the Thirties & Forties, etc.That there are absolutely no characters to empathize with in this muddled story is no argument in its favor either.One can easily find better employment of several hours than plodding through this contrived dreck which reads like the panic attack-induced phantasies of an anxious parent with a teenager preparing to leave home the first time for college."
4,An unusual gothic and suspenseful tale,"Joyce carol Oates gives readers an unusual, gothic, suspenseful, and mesmerizing short narrative. Gillian Brauer, a bright twenty-year old college student at a New England college for women, whose elderly parents are in the process of divorcing, falls under the spell of a rather bizarre-acting, anti-establishment professor of poetry and the professor's wife, and is certain that she is in love with her teacher. She allows him and his wife to treat her as virtually a slave in unusual ways. The professor's wife who comes from France and who has lived in America for some fifteen years refuses to learn English well. She is a sculptress who outrages many people with her statues of erotic expressionistic totems, many with bare breasts. Gillian notices that other students are acting strangely like her, including suicide attempts, while some leave the college."
2,Life's too short&#65533;,"Life is too short--and precious--to waste on books as mediocre as this one. If you want ""gothic romance"" and an examination of the ""baser side of human nature"" (as the book's dust-jacket blurbs promise) I'd recommend any of Carson McCuller's far superior novels."
3,disappointed,"The game is ok, but honestly NASCAR HEAT is much better. The graphs are decent, but the gameplay is kinda weak. I had high hopes for this game and I am disappointed...."
1,boguss,this game is ok if you are a nascar fan but it is nothing compared to nascar heat 2002. the grafics bite and the crash effects suck.
5,whats up with career mode?????????,"ok....yes this game is good, but not great....what is up with the career mode? i started that mode and i could not change how many races to run, how many laps, or if i can have a caution and more...i don't get that...the season mode is all there...can any one tell me why they can't put viagra on martins car? that is ridicules...the extrat paint schemes in season mode is cool...there could be alot better game play then there is but yes it is still a great game..come on its nascar!!!...next game they should add weather factors including rain, snow, etc...and there is kinda of a silly season on this game, but they had kyle petty retire after 1 year of play??? and who are the talkers, announcers that introduce each race???come on ea..it could be better!!!"
4,Nascar Thunder 2002,"I own Nascar Thunder 02, it is a realistic and fun game to play. However,I was dissapointed with it's career mode. What is the point of playing in a career mode? when your allowed to race on 12 pre-seleceted race track; as well as having NO control over the yellow flag and many other options that you normally have in the season mode. I am tired of EA company who screw its customers by not fully developing their games. I hope that in the future, competitions from other game makers will force EA to improve the details (options) of their games. ""Step Up EA"""
3,Career Mode has Serious Flaws,"The game doesn't deliver on the ""Career"" mode. Yes the career mode enables you to build a car, buy upgrades, earn sponsers, etc. However, it is limited to 12 races a year, 5% of actual laps, no caution flags. The season mode does include the option to change these things, but the career mode does not. The game does have excellent graphics and is fun, but for me the replay value is severly diminished due to the career mode flaws. Luckily I rented the game before my order arrived so I can return my copy unopened. Rent it and try it before you buy it."
2,Buyer Beware,"This is a great cookbook...if you can get it! I have looked at one in the past. When I ordered it ..from one of the less expensive sellers ($5), I received some funky nutrition for science workbook for second graders. The actual shipper was Thrift Recyle Management out of Kentucky. That was not even the one I ordered from...some kind of bait and switch. I put a negative review and they said this was shipped by Amazon and that only they could fix it! How about it AMAZON?"
1,Bad Listing,"First order never arrived. Got a prompt refund though. One the second order, I received a childs coloring book instread! Did receive a prompt response and refund. I still want to buy this book but am afraid that Amazon stock numbers will send me the same coloring book!"
2,has single screw per bracket,"i had purchased this to install a 12"" deep shelf , if you cant screw it to a stud ( i used a toggle bolt) & the shelf is deeper than 8' and if the total weight is more than 20 lbs this bracket will not hold the shelf horizontal . it will tilt forward. use for light objects only. it has only one screw per bracket that too not easily accessible , needs a long driver extension. a second screw would inspire more confidence.dont want to waste money on returning"
2,disappointing,"this book just reminds you how much better brian michael bendis' writing is. the series is so slow it could have been a one-shot instead of a 5-part series. although we do get the addition of the falcon to the ultimates' ranks (at least temporarily) and the debut of the ultimate vision, there is little else that's worthwhile. bendis' and millar's previously subtle characterization is shot to pieces here: the three x-men here are bratty and incredibly immature; the falcon is a pompous know-it-all; and captain america and fury are mere caricatures. skip this one."
5,The Ultimate imprint delivers again,"One of the greatest things about the Ultimate universe is the way old and venerable characters and storylines are treated with a 21st century sensibility, and that they are almost totally devoid of ""filler"" the way Marvel's 616 (or ""regular"") universe has been throughout the years.""Nightmare"" gives us the best of what we've become used to in the Ultimate universe - gritty, realistic characterizations, and compelling, suspenseful storylines - while touching on territory that is so far unexplored in this imprint... the coming of Galactus. It also gives a weight and a mystery to Galactus (or Gah Lak Tus, in this incarnation) that was not present in it's original incarnation.The book itself is very suspenseful and reads like a horror story, and is compelling enough to hook even someone uninitiated to these characters at all. Best of all, at the end, the reader is left wanting more, and looking forward to the next two installments in this series."
4,"vols 1 and 2 were very good, 3 was awful and ruined it all...","in vol 1, a team of x-men and a team of ultimates investigate an underground russian bunker from which a bizarre worldwide broadcast is emanating. other than the x-men and avengers spontaneously fighting each other for no good reason other than because the writer and artist wanting it to happen, vol 1 was very good.however i would not recommend this trilogy because vol 3 is so incredibly awful it made reading the first two volumes a waste of time."
2,Disappointing at it's best,This story just dragged on forever it could've easily been three issues and gotten by. The art is decent and Warren Ellis is usually a pretty good writer but this was just disappointing. I liked the edition of Ultimate Falcon in this book and that is about it. This arc as a whole was prett disappointing it could've been so much better then what it was.
1,Maximum Material BUT Minimum Audio Pleasure,"What great material John Mortimer wrote, only to have some hack of a producer/director and the reader to ""put Mr. Mortimer in the frame"" for a truely poor listening experience.Mr. Mortimer should recall every issue of this product before it produces irreparable harm to the Rumple image.The reader speaks soo fast and with such slur that only one in four words can be understood. For shame."
5,Best Compilation of The Stooges Lost Sessions,"I have spent a lot of time and a ton of money on CDs of the Stooges ""lost"" sessions. I was very hesitant to even buy this CD because I have spent so much money and purchased so many of the Stooges ""lost"" sessions on which the quality of the recordings were horrible. This CD is the complete opposite though. The recording quality is good, not perfect but the best I have ever heard of this material, and if your looking at this review, you know how good the material is. Buy this CD and don't waist your time buying other CDs that lack the quality."
3,Falls apart if you look at it!,"This product has major design flaws. It is made to be able to be changed in its configuration. The problem with this is that it falls apart easily, the pieces do not stay snapped together and it frustrates my four and a half year old when this happens. We have lots of Playmobil products and this is not the case for that product line. I refrain from buying anymore of this line of toys! Unless you like to constantly remake a layout for a smaller child I would wait until the child is 7-8 before even buying this product! By then, the set is to simplistic for children of this age group. I bet this design flaw is why this product has come in price so much since it was first introduced!"
4,50/50,"The ideas with this toy are great - the rock crusher, the battery operated conveyor belt and crane, but it has to be built from the bottom up, so once assembled, you have no chance of slotting any pieces back into place. You have to take the whole thing apart and start again. And as for all these three year olds who, according to their parents, are merrily building different construction sites to their own specifiation, don't believe it for a second. Rocket science couldn't be much more complicated than Imaginext stuff. Two tips. Build it on a surface where it doesn't need to be moved, and be prepared for 'Mom can you build this again' twenty times a day. Oh, and another thing - it's huge."
1,Right Off The Farm,"We were traveling with friends and listened to this. Wow, the sliding up to the notes and just overall BAD singing and arrangements. My 5 y/o even commented on sloppy vocals. Just goes to show that anyone can 'cut a record' these days. Ugh."
5,Love it!,It's very playful and beautifully sang. I even bought one for my friend who has a two year old and a new born!
5,Another Outstanding Performance!!!,"We have all of Susie Tallman's CD's. Every car we own has one or two in the CD player at any given time. The kids love it, and so do the parents. Can't wait for another release. Hurry up Susie!!!"
5,EXCELLENT CD FOR BABIES!,"THE BABY I TAKE CARE OF (I'M A NANNY) REALLY LOVES THIS CD.I'M MEXICAN AND SHE'S AMERICAN, SO, SHE'S LEARNING BOTH LANGUAGESAND THIS CD REALLY CAPTURES HER ATTENTION. I REALLY RECOMMEND IT,IT'S GREAT!"
2,Disappointed !!,"Since we live overseas, where English kids CD's are hard to come by, we ordered this CD thinking it would be a fun collection of popular English nursery rhymes for our kids. But, although the disk contains all the classical favorites, many of them are sung to different melodies from the original, and even those that retained the classical melody, have used variations on the melody making them sound very different. Our kids disliked the changes and found most of the songs too strange. A great disappointment! I think that calling the disk classical rhymes is misleading and suggest listening to this one before you buy."
5,Excellent!!,An excellent resource for Marian apologetics. Fr Stravinskas cites numerous objections and answers them. Footnotes provide full information for more research if the reader desires. Great!
2,out of luck,"I bought this toy for my almost 5 yrs old sons for Christmas. The toy is great but did not realize that it did not come with an action figure, I know I should have read the box better but did not. I thought no problem I will just go and buy them a couple of figures, that is until I realized that you need specail Mission Select figures and you can't find them anywhere. Since this toy has dropped in price from about $70.00 a year ago to $29.99 now they must be fazing it out, but I am so disappointed that they pushed it so much this Christmas Season and now we can't even find a mission select action figure to go with it. Don't buy this unless you actually see the right action figure being sold right next to it."
4,great for price,I too bought this at the clearance price and my son loves it. It didnt take long at all to put together- if you read the directions! its all plastic and durable. the kids have spent many hours playing with it. It definitely is another great rescue hero buy!
3,Rescue Mission Needs to be Rescued......,"I was very excited to buy this toy for my son (4.5) but after spending two hours of putting it together, I was greatly disappointed. It isn't all that great of toy for the price you pay for it. There is too much plastic involved and it isn't sturdy plastic either. I know he is enjoying it right now but it won't be used as much as his other Rescue Hero toys. I have to say Fisher Price really needs to rethink this one."
1,This is awful,"As a parent of a 4 yr old, I must say this is his and my least liked toy. It was a gift from his grandparents, so I didn't pay for it, but I personally would not buy it for even less than $5. It took forever to set up, is awkward to play with and the 'missions' are jumbled and uninspired. I wish I had kept the box, I would have returned it."
1,Misleading packaging,"I can only echo the previous review. This toy is a disappointment on all counts.First of all, the package shows pictures of different rescue heroes with numerous vehicles and accessories surrounding the command center. When you open the box, however, the only thing you will find is the Mission Headquarters. After we looked at the box a second and third time, we finally found the miniscule print that says the action figures and vehicles are sold separately. This for a toy that cost $60 on sale!!Our son is really into the rescue heroes, so we will be returning the Mission HQ and purchasing individual figures and accessories.Fisher-Price should be ashamed!"
1,Mattel Discontinued the action figures for this toy-,Mattel has discontinued the action figures that interact with this toy. Just thought I would let people know.
4,Lots of fun for a Rescue Hero fan,"I love the fact that this command center folds up; maybe not as compactly as the pictures on the box appear to show, but it still takes up less room than the ARCC which we previously owned. The instructions were well written and it's really not hard at all to take apart if you need to - just need a little hand strength and a good flat-head screwdriver. We assembled it in about an hour, from opening the box to afixing the last decal - just me and my 3 yr old. He loves the elevator, which seems to work fine, and the talking feature, of course.I've seen many people complain that the Mission Select heroes are no longer sold - that's true, but this also works with any of the Rescue Heroes with the little metal contacts on their backs - we had several of the ""older"" Voice Tech figures, and they work great with this set."
5,Hours of enjoyment but there are issues,"My son is crazy for this toy and plays with it everyday. I agree with the others that the garage attachment and the flight pad attachment do come of very easily along with the crane attachment. I agree that Fisher Price needs to make this toy for durable for the price. Regardless of my issues my 3 1/2 year old plays with it everyday. Also, I too had to buy additional Mission Select Heroes to activate the voice feature."
2,Disappointed,"My 5 y/o son is a major rescue heroes fan, and we have just about every figure and vehicle that has been put out in the last 5 years. What's extremely disappointing is that NONE of these figures or vehicles will work with this particular set. Now I can understand having to purchase new vehicles and figures with the ""new mission select technology"" IF they were somewhat different than the ones we already have. I just can't justify buying the SAME EXACT TOYS with the new technology, what a ripoff! The set isn't even that great, everytime you move it the slightest bit, pieces are falling off. We have the aquatic command center, and love it, but I have to say that we're extremely disappointed with the mountain command center. I also bought one for my nephew, and it gets low ratings at his house too."
2,Love Rescue Heros - Do not like MACC,"We love Rescue Heros at our house!!! I have 2 boys (age 4 & 2). The 4 year old has the big boat command center so we decided to get the 2 year old the Mission Select MACC. Unfortunantly, this command center is a serious disappointment. Like previous reviews, it was slightly difficult to put together - when apart, all the pieces look alike. Now that its together, this toy is not sturdy. Our ""boat"" command center can take a serious beating, but this one rocks and sways like crazy. There is a ""trap"" door on the back side that does NOT fit and won't stay shut and the vehicle ramp does not stay on the ""hinges"". Also, the elevator won't go all the way up or down without force. We have a full collection of RH figures and vehicles because my boys LOVE them, but I have to admit, I am very diappointed in this command center - more because of the sturdiness issue. If my 2 year old weren't so excited about having his own command center, [...]."
4,Great workout!,"I have really enjoyed using this video for a change in my workouts. With my other videos I didn't feel like I was working that hard. Since I have started this video, I have lost 5 pounds in the last 4 weeks. It makes me work harder and sweat a lot more. I like the challenge she offers in the video instead of always doing the easy routine. This video was worth my purchase."
5,Complex choreography in a fun way!,"I love the fact that most of the music is music that I recognize! The choreography is complex, but she breaks it down for you in the ""Move Master"" section of the DVD. She also has ""Combination Platters,"" where she will make different combinations of step segments and automatically pairs them with a warm up and a cool down-- you don't have to shuffle around the DVD to find your favorite parts of the workout. A must buy for an aerobic DVD collection!"
1,Waste of Money,"Way too complicated even for an Intermediate stepper. Too fast paced to follow. No real warm up, no real beat. This DVD would be for the very fit and extremely advanced stepper."
1,Solid Gold Step and Totally Cool Step by Christie Taylor,"This video was a big letdown! I'm a fairly advanced stepper and found this fast and confusing. Yes, there is an additional section of the DVD of step-by-step instruction but if I knew I had to waste time learning these complicated routines first, I wouldn't have bought it. I just want a dvd did I can pop in and a get a great, challenging workout and this is not it! I purchased her other one at the same time ""Totally cool step"" which is equally as disappointing."
1,HATE IT!!!,"This routine is too fast paced to enjoy or follow, there's not really any beat to follow and I could never get into the routine because she only does every step once before yelling out another instruction. She NEVER stops talking and I find it distracting! I'm an Intermediate to Advanced stepper and thought I'd be able to follow and appreciate the more complicated choreography, but I just can't get into it, it has no rhythm to speak of and I find myself RACING to keep up with her. I thoroughly hate this DVD."
2,Not my style,"The advertisement for this program suggests Christi is a fitness expert, but the feel of the workout is more like your next-door neighbor decided to make a fitness video. While some people may like this informal approach, I found myself lacking confidence that her moves were really designed with proper knowledge of the human body. It was also quite inconsistent in level--the breakdown teaching session is too basic, then the dance segment is too fast. I didn't like the music, either, which was the reason I purchased this particular workout and which suggests that the music is drawn from chart-topping hits. It isn't. Most of it was written by her son--not bad for a young kid, but not chart-topping music and not what I thought was advertised. Compared to many other step and exercise programs I own, I thought this whole effort was below average."
1,These Bungee Cords SUCK!!!!!!!!,"These bungee cords are only .18 inches in diameter and are very week, unlike standard bungee cords that are .50 in diameter.The product photo is very misleading making you think you are purchasing standard size .50 diameter bungee cords.Also these cords have already started to rot and fall apart even as I have stored them out of the sun."
