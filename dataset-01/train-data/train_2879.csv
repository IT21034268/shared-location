4,Lots of fun,"The disc is well-recorded, and features some excellent playing and singing of more-or-less traditional ""kids"" tunes. There are a few weak moments, such as a flat performance of Arkansas Traveler, but by and large the humor and warmth carry the day. There are a few gems, too, such as Shenandoah, that no Jerry/Dawg fan should be without."
5,Always a Pleasure to listen to,This is a masterpiece! You can really tell that David and Jerry had a good time making this album.
4,Good CD,"One of my favorite albums is the self titled Jerry Garcia/David Grisman, so I had to buy Not for Kids Only for my daughter. She likes it and so do I."
2,I wanted so badly to like this.,"I really couldn't wait to get this CD. I wanted so badly to like it. But - it is just too bluegrassy for me. Every single song. It would be great one or two songs, but every song gets old. Plus, the recording quality doesn't seem that great. You can barely hear the words, and most kids want to sing along. Jenny Jenkins is a fun song, and Shenendoah is hauntingly beautiful, but For the Kids and NO! are way better CD's."
5,A favorite,"We bought this before our child was born because my husband is a huge Garcia fan, and we enjoyed it. We played it often for our baby, and it ALWAYS put her to sleep. She now listens to it by choice at bedtime, and still ALWAYS puts her to sleep - she's 3.5 years old now."
3,Good tunes,"I bought this CD when it was released a few years ago, and thought it would be perfect when we had kids... We recently had a little girl and started playing the CD again and she hates it, sorry Dawg. Most songs have basic folk type of lyrics, but they all sound the same, esp to out 6 month old girl. I am a Huge Jerry fan, but found this CD a little too trendy for my taste."
3,Genie Excelerator garage door opener,"I ordered this as a replacement for the same type unit that had malfunctioned after six years of use. I ordered a new opener and spent a few hours installing it. After everything was in place and ready to go, I went to push the button to ""train"" the remote controls and the switch did not function. I contacted Amazon who very quickly sent out a new one with upgraded shipping at no charge. The second opener worked just fine. I am a bit disappointed at having to install then uninstall then install again but I am very happy with how Amazon handled the issue."
1,Do NOT buy a Genie!!!!,"I bought this product due to its lifetime warranty. When the product began to malfunction I called for service, and I found out the true worth of the Genie company. All they do is have you talk to a call center person, who will keep asking you questions until they can tell you that your garage door is ""unbalanced."" After they told me this, I had a professional garage door installer come out and he examined the door and stated it was perfectly balanced. Genie refused to honor their warranty because they stated it was documented that my door was unbalanced. They never looked at my door, and refused to accept the evaluation by a professional garage door installer. The installer told me he gets numerous calls every week about the Genie Excellerator, and the poor customers are always told that the door was unbalanced. My opener ONLY malfunctioned during the heat, and had nothing to do with the unbalanced door. DO NOT BUY A GENIE PRODUCT!!!!!!"
1,Buyer Beware! Genie will not honor their 5-year warranty!,"I am now shopping for a non-Genie new garage door opener after Genie refused to honor their 5-year warranty. After 2 years, the motor started malfunctioning and cost me $400 to replace a 2-year old garage door. (Yes, I am the first owner of my house and this is the very first garage door opener of the garage)I called Genie regarding my problem and they refused to replace ANYTHING, but instead asked me to adjust some settings on the unit. I did adjust the settings as they instructed only to have the problem happen again.I WILL NEVER BUY GENIE AGAIN!"
5,Best Christian Author Out There,"I love Max Lucado, I love his books. You really cannot wait to meet God after reading his books. He makes everything simple.There is a light that shines out of all his books and you know he has a very personal relationship with God and wants to help you have one too. He has a great sense of humor and uses his everyday living as lessons. I believe I have most of his books and soon as I know of a new one I try to buy it right away. I pass them on to friends and family to read, but always get them back as I re-read a lot of them.If you want to get closer to the Lord read Max's books. They are terrific."
5,I was able to let go,"I loved this book! I finally realized some of the burdens that I was carrying and was able to let go through Max Lucado's insight and wisdom. I LOVED all of the analogies, and especially the relation to the shepherd and the sheep. He did a wonderful job on this book!"
2,Inspiring Light,"I was looking forward to reading this book after scanning all of the superlative online reviews. In addition, structuring a book about releasing life's burdens around Psalm 23 (the Lord is my shepherd) seemed very compelling to me. But, despite the great reviews and the excellent premise, the book was a big disappointment. The insights to a number of life's problems he drew from Psalm 23 seemed superficial and uninspirational to me. I'm not sure I can fully articulate why, just that he didn't connect with or inspire me as I had hoped.Max Lacudo is obviously a very popular author, who clearly has touched many readers. This book has evidently moved people as well. I'm sorry I wasn't one of them."
2,audio cassettee,would not play on my computer. Was for an olderpc. cound not use. Didn't realize it was suchan old version
1,Sure Whatever,"If you were to believe what this book was saying you would have to have an at least partial lobotomy. I have slightly religeous tendencies but to make statement like ""I actually remember the day that Jesus was crucified"" and ""Moses was a break dancer"" just don't seem to gel with me.Some of the concepts are actually reasonable. Most people would like to make a million dollars and so the prayers throughout the book requesting money from god are quite practical and useful.If Moses was really a break dancer where did he get a ghetto blaster? I just don't get it!"
5,Excellent book,This is one book that I intend to read over and over. The messages are life-changing and Mr. Lucado's writing style makes it enjoyable and interesting. I have purchased 4 copies for friends and family. I recommend this book to anyone.
4,Traveling Light,"As always, Max Lucado, catches your interest, includes examples of his own life, makes you comfortable, connects to just what you are going through or have gone through, and points you in the right direction."
3,Good book,A lot of obvious in it. Great book for the new Christian. Well-written and syntax proficient. It is an easy read.
5,Excellent read!,I received this book from a friend and enjoyed it so much I had to purchase a copy for another friend. Max Lucado has taken Psalm 23 and written specific examples how this Psalm can help us in today's challenging world.
5,Unload Your Burdens On the Savior!,"Once again, Lucado writes another wonderful title designed for those who struggle in life's journey.Among the many excellent points Lucado covers include:1. What we have in Jesus is greater than anything we have in life.2. The fine art of resting in the Lord.3. Let God relieve you of anxiety. He will give you answers and provision in his time and way.4. Jesus provides vision and direction.5. We have nothing and are nothing apart from Christ.6. God will use loneliness to draw us to Him.7. Before you go to others with your disappoints and pain, bring them first to God.Highly recommended for the content and devotional format."
3,Not as Advertised,"This bar purports to be 2 feet long. It is not. It is 4 feet long and as such was totally unsuitable for my purposes. I was unable to get it exchanged for the size advertised. Other than the mislabeled length, the product appears to be fine."
1,Poor Packaging,"Packaging was poorly wrapped. Upon picking bar up from my door step, bar slipped out box falling on my feet. Burse my toes. Lucky I did not fractured my toes! Boxe on both end was poorly taped."
2,inaccessible figures,A potentially useful article has been rendered almost useless because of my inability to access the figures referred to in the text
4,Just gets better and better ...,"I bought this album because it's considered a classic, and because I love the fiddle stylings of Vassar Clements. At first I was irked by some out-of-tune vocal harmonies (it's live, after all). But I kept the album on and set the CD player to continuous play. Well, the second time it started at the beginning, I was hooked. I listened a couple more times and had to force myself to turn it off. It is really a true gem of an album. Vassar's fiddling is top-notch, a great example of his classic licks and style. Garcia, Grisman and Rowan also rock. This is indeed a classic bluegrass album, and should be in any respectable collection."
5,Bluegrass lovers,"This CD is great! If you are not a bluegrass fan, it will certainly make you one! Some of Jerry Garcia's finest work without his electric guitar. He sure picks a mean banjo!"
5,Good Music,I do not listen to T his kind of music all the time but I loved the first album had it for years so when I found out about the other two I had to order them right away.So I ordered #2 and it was just as good as the first one now I will order the third one.It does not get much better than this.These guys are great.Thumbs up.
5,The greatest reference on the subject.,"Ce livre est une référence sur le sujet. Comme plusieurs ingénieurs et techniciens en mécanique, je me demandais si ma faon de tolérancer était juste et si les normes que j'utilisaient était à jour. Ce livre nous explique bien les différences entre asme et iso, la faon graphique de représenter les tolérances, et surtout: comment inspecter les pièces et comment calculer les écarts de tolérances (IT) pour des mécanismes fonctionnels. De plus, l'achat de ce livre peut vous faire économiser le prix des normes ISO ou ASME car il est rédigé selon les normes les plus récentes (2005)."
4,Great!,"I bought this for my husband for his birthday. He really likes it - which is saying a great deal, because he doesn't like too many things!!!"
5,BreakdownL Live Recordings 1973,My casstte of OLD AND IN THE WAY self destructed and I had to replace it. This is what I found after searching. The playlist isn't in the same order and there are a few extra tunes but boy was it good to get this back again. Vassar Clemens and Jerry Garcia never sounded better.
5,This is the best Old and In the Way disc,"It has 19 tunes while the original disc only has 10. The versions of the tunes on this one are, I think, superior to those on the first disc. It doesn't really matter, though. It's just plain great music."
1,Deserves less than 1 star,"This is horrible. I couldn't watch a full episode because if I finished it, it would ruin my opinion of scooby. I love Scooby especially the old ones. Whats new and mystery incorporated are good- Matthew Jonesps I consider a pup and 13 ghosts old"
1,NOT THE REAL SCOOBY!!!!,"My daughter loves Scooby and the gang, and when she saw this, she was horrified. This looks nothing like the Scooby gang that Hannah/Barberra created! Thankfully, she doesn't own this stuff. She figures if it isn't released by Warner Bros. or Hannah/Barberra, and if it doesn't have Casey Kasem in it, then it ISN'T the real Scooby! Get more of the real Scooby shows onto DVD, and not this crap! If I was allowed to, I'd give it a -1 star. That show should not have been created!"
1,Trash,"What had the potential to be a great Christian novel was soiled by too much descriptive trash. I expect to read that sort of thing in an over the counter novel but was very disappointed to find it in a ""Christian"" novel. The same message could have been delivered with just as much punch without the garbage."
4,Really great read,"This book is really good and makes you think of your own life and that saying your grandma always told you ""be careful what you wish for!!!"" Dont want to be a spoiler but the end definitely makes you think there will be a squel...maybe! Happy reading..."
4,A good read.,A very inspirational story of a woman who's able to have a career and marriage that takes effort to sustain. Inspirational but not overly preachy. If you want to take your mind off of the daily routine I highly recommend reading this!!!
2,Wasnt for me,This was the first time I read a book by this author and the story just was so unrealistic and predictable for me. Its a decent read and I would purchase another book by her.
3,"""Truth Be Told?...So What!""","There's really nothing to say about this novel other than it was boring,predictable and the chapters were too long to get to the point."
5,Awesome,I have read all of Victoria Chritopher Murray's books and they are all absolutely wonderful. I really love this book because it made me re-evaluate myself. Most women could not and would not be able to do what Grace Munore did. Would we totally lean and depend on God to work out the situation? This is a wonderfully written book and I recommend it highly!!!!!
5,Christian Fiction at it's best!,"Ms. Murray has done it again. She weaves a tale of characters and situations that are true to life and happening in our own backyards! The author has a gift of writing ""hurt scenes"" that put you in the character's shoes and really make you feel their pain. Her characters are real people going through real situations looking for real solutions. This book gives hope to others that are dealing with chidren that result from marital affairs. It offers sound Biblical and sensical advice on marital and family values, and how to keep Christ FIRST. Bravo Ms. Murray."
3,"Truth be told, it was just an okay read","I wasn't impressed with this story. It really didn't do anything ""new"" or ""encouraging"" for me. It was just an average read. Nothing spectacular, but it was a bit too long of a story."
3,The Truth Was Some What Told,"This is the 3nd book that I've read by this author. This is a good story about infidelity and how a family deals with a child out of wedlock. Although this was a great story-line, the author failed to go into detail regarding the underlying issues regarding infidelity and lack of spiritual connection with God. Rather, the author scrubs the surfaces of both these issues."
1,This is just the workbook...,"It doesn't really make sense without the videos. You really need the videos - if you just need a replacement workbook, this is fine.But otherwise I don't know why anyone would buy just the companion workbook without the videos."
5,"Easy to install, good price","After finding the stud location, this mount took us only 10 minutes to install. Instruction is clear and simple. Mount is small and tilts well, a very good fit for LCD TV smaller than 40 inch."
2,"Not all 40"" TVs will are supported","The construction is fine but my Sharp Aquos 40"" has 16"" on center Mounting holes (16""x16"") and this simply doesn't fit. The max on this unit, while not specified, appears to be about 9.5"" High by maybe 12"" wide.To bad critical information like this is not supplied.I'm returning and next time will call/EMAIL the manufacturer to get the critical dimensions for mounting rather than rely on the screen size."
5,"Tilt Wall Mount for 26"" to 42"" Displays (Silver)","Fast shipping, one forth the price of what I would have paidat best buy....great quality. Am very happy with purchase."
1,Clipped,"At first it seems like a home run and then, bam! The little spring inside breaks and you are left with a useless hunk of metal. Go to the corner drug store and get some safety nose hair scissors, they have rounded edges, and finish up with one of many electric trimmers. Complete and utter RIP OFF!"
4,In common justice,"It seems only fair to remark that the invective directed against the book by some Amazon customers is something profoundly different in kind from what one finds in reviews by authoritative people. See, for example, the detailed reviews by Ed Waymire in American Mathematical Monthly, Vol. 110, 2003, pp. 964-967, and by Marjorie Hahn in Computing in Science and Engineering, Vol. 6, 2004, pp. 85-88. In forty years of teaching probability theory, I have had very many students who would not have found a book such as this particularly challenging, but who would have welcomed what challenges it does pose."
1,Weighing the Odds an absolutely worthless text,"This is the worst mathematics book that I have ever used. This book is being used for 2 semesters - Introduction to Probability Theory and Mathematical Statistics. It was completely worthless for the the Introduction to Probability Theory as I had to buy Sheldon Ross' ""A First Course in Probability"" just to make sense out the course. This book has no examples and the way it is written is often very cryptic. Even the problems that have answers in the back of the book are not explained. Often times the author will just say it is obvious for part of the solution when it is far from obvious. This book needs many more examples and more thorough explanations of topics. This is not the review of a disgruntled student getting a poor grade and just criticizing the text. I am getting an A in the class but no thanks to this worthless text! In fact I plan on burning the book when my course work is finished!"
5,Simply good tunes,"Was visiting a buddy in Providence last summer with my wife and we listened to this disc about 10 times one afternoon and NEVER got tired of it. I finally got off my ... and asked what it was and was told that it would be hard to find, so of course I started searching. Got this one, IV, and VI and will probably just work my way thru the series unless and until I come across one I don't like...which is doubtful. Cheers!"
1,HUGE RIPOFF!!,"If you are looking for a CD by The Four Tops - the original Four Tops (Duke Fakir, Levi Stubbs, Lawrence Payton, Obie Benson) THIS AIN'T IT FOLKS!!! This isn't even the current lineup but some IMPOSTERS who are billing themselves as The Four Tops. DO NOT BUY THIS - go get The 50th Anniversary CD - it's original songs. DON'T BE FOOLED!!! This CD says ""New stereo recordings by the original artists"" which is a blatant lie!!DO NOT BUY - WASTE OF MONEY"
1,An atrocity.,"This is definitely NOT the Four Tops. It's not the original group with Levi Stubbs, and it's not even the current touring lineup with Levi's replacement. It's just some anonymous vocalists singing over horrid synth-heavy instrumental tracks. Not sure why they had the bright idea to try and pass this off as a Four Tops release, since they only perform two Tops tunes and don't even make a token effort to imitate the real group."
1,Four Tops Forever Gold,Forget this one if you are interested in what you remember these songs sounded like on the radio long ago -- you're hearing 60's and 70's songs recorded in 2000.
5,Brava...,"One of the things I loved about Coming Back To Me was that it gave a nice feeling of neighborhood. It was Hoboken, New Jersey, but it could have been any suburb. I also loved the plot. It was very unusual. One of the main characters didn't appear until almost half the book was over, but it all worked. Brava!"
3,need to fact check,"While I enjoyed the development of characters through their past experiences, and the story overall, the author lost all credibility because of obvious and very easy to check misnomers. Specifically, 'cystic fibrosis' is not caused by a lack of oxygen, it is an inherited disorder. 'Cerebral palsy' can often be the result of oxygen deprivation. Once this gross error occurred I was less likely to believe the medically-based premise of the story. Other simple to catch mistakes such as often exchanging the word diapers for formula in several places, left me frustrated that the author was more interested in publication than quality of the product."
5,fantastic book club read,"My book group chose this for a recent read and we couldnt' stop talking about the characterizations and the clear, brilliant writing. I just went and ordered Leavitt's other book. What I loved was there was the ebb and flow of story, like life, rather than ends being neatly tied up. Can't wait to read her next novel."
5,An absorbing story with characters that seem real,"Caroline Leavitt has truly touched a chord with me in writing this book. You truly feel you are living in her world while reading this book. Everything from her romance, marriage, new neighborhood, birth of son and subsequent medical trauma. Molly's experiences in the hospital are very true to life, ask anyone who has spent time in a coma and in the ICU. The ripple effect of Molly's illness spreads further than her immediate family as evidenced by the arrival of her sister and what that impact has not only with our heroine but the local neighborhood. Thank you for a good read."
5,The strength of love endures and is honored.,"Having already passed this book on to someone I love, I can endorse the quiet wonders of the story and the clear and insightful writing of the author. The courage under duress of one of the main characters pull at the heart and his stuggle is one to which most of us can relate. The Family and difficult and complex relationships are at the heart of this well-told and can't-put-it-down novel."
4,Rollercoaster Ride,"I picked this book up from my wife's night table and started to read about Gary, facing single fatherhood, grapping with the loss trying to find his place in a not very friendly welcoming community, and I was hooked. The writer seems to understand the workings of the human heart so well. I know this is nitpicking, but I was disappointed that the author's photo was not on the back book cover. Excellent reading!"
2,"So easy to read, you can skip huge portions","Such a simple writing style, that you can skim huge portions and still get the entire superficial story. Not much depth at all. There were so many characters introduced; yet, no in depth follow-up. For example, their mother up and moves to Florida and we never hear about her again (until a brief comment about her death). All the neighbors commented upon, yet we never got to know them. And the cover dared to comment this author with Jane Hamilton, omg, LOL"
2,Not impressed.,"The first book I read by the author was ""Pictures of You"" - which had me hooked from the beginning. With this book, it didn't - not until almost 3/4 into it, when I was already bored out of my mind. And even then, it was just.. mehhh."
1,Yuck,Too much dysfunctionality with hardly a point to be made.The one star if for an engaging writing style.
1,Loved It a Lot!,"This book touched me deeply, in a way that few other books have. The story took amazing, unpredictable yet totally believable turns that kept me wondering what would happen next. The characters were beautifully drawn; I felt that these people really existed for me. I would recommend it to anyone who believes in love!"
3,The author's signature style,"As I read more of Ms. Leavitt's books (this is the third), I notice recurring elements: constellations of freckles, unruly & irresistable hair, vocational school boys, teachers, floundering parents, and the longing generated by secrets and mis-communications, to name a few. In spite of the sense of deja vu inspired by these similarities, I enjoy the author's methods of storytelling, and her confessional manner of letting the reader know all there is to know about the folks who people her novels."
5,Couldn't stop reading,"I stayed up all night reading this book. From the very first image of Gary feeding his newborn in a diner, I was caught. Loved Molly, the mother whose life is threatened, loved the sort-of-wild sister Suzanne who finds herself forced to help, loved it, too, that even the baby was a character in his own right! This is a story about family and the sudden way happiness can turn right into nightmare, but it's also about finding your community, and about how love can rescue you or at least offer sustenance. The writing was lyrical and clear, the emotions true."
4,What a find,"I love a book that can take plot and add to it characters that you want to be with and don't forget. I just loved that little Baby Otis (and naming the baby Otis, just added to his cachet) and it was wonderful watching the characters interact with him. Caroline Leavitt did such a fine job of character development with Molly, her mom, her sister, Suzanne, and her husband, Gary. I really knew these people. The story of Molly's critical illness shortly after giving birth to Otis, and how much this affected so many people was done with marvelous skill. This book is a find."
1,Very disapointed in size,"Transformers Deluxe Classic Bumblebee Figure, I brought this for my 10 year old grandson for Chkristmas. It seems to be very well made but I did pay $54.99 for it & was very disapointed in the size of it. Feel the size of it was not plain enough to see. We were all surprised how small it was when he opened it, as he enjoys building & playing with them. Have gotten him other transformers for around the same price & they were all a larger size, so now I will be rethinging about ordering from you again.Thank you, Sharon from Sacramento"
3,"NOT THE SAME VERSION AS THE THEME-SONG ON ""CAR TALK""...","Good recordings and great sound quality; please just be aware, folks, that contrary to what it says on the Car Talk website, this album does NOT contain the same superb version of ""Dawggy Mountain Breakdown"" that they play as the theme song for the ""Car Talk"" radio show! The version heard on this album is (in my humble opinion) considerably less richly musical and satisfying than the Car Talk version. There's no accounting for taste, though, so what do I know??? Hee hee hee!!"
3,Theme from CarTalk,"I can't say I've listened to the album, but I know ""Dawgy Mountain Breakdown"" by heart-- it's NPR's CarTalk theme song. Listen and enjoy!"
3,"Not bad, but could have been better","Decent book, but i was expecting something else. it is basically a food critics version out what goes on in a restaurant. He gives tips on how to get reservations and a little insight to the mentality of the employees. i thought it was going to be more about the industry from the inside from an insider, not one pretending to be. worth reading for entertainment. He writes well so it's a quick read."
4,INFORMATIVE AND FUNNY,"SHORT, AND AMUSING...THE AUTHOR EXPLAINS THE WORKINGS OF RESERVATIONS, WAITSTAFF, AND THE DETAILS THAT GO INTO RUNNING A RESTAURANT, BE IT 4 STAR IN NY OR A MOM AND POP..BEING FOODIES, MY HUSBAND AND I BOTH LOVED IT!"
1,Self-congratulatory and uninsightful,"The author writes with a dissonant combination of pomposity and indiscriminate praise, like an overconfident, star-struck teenager. In lieu of the investigative, eye-opening look at resturants his book's title implies, Shaw offers self-promotion and uncritical opinion, which he presents as fact in regular, two- to five-page lectures worthy only of a soapbox on a deserted street. Turning the Tables is 200 pages of pure agony. Avoid it at all costs."
2,"Overall, a disappointment","Many parts of the book were well written, but if you are interested in reading about securing ""that ever-coveted reservation"", skip this book. Shaw did not offer anything that I have not gathered from my own experience. There were pages and pages of Shaw lecturing the reader about the obvious importance of timely confirming a reservation & what a disadvantage it would be *for the restaurant. However lacking his stereotypical insights into people were, I would consider reading his future projects because of his writing style."
1,Loves the sound of his own voice,Just like eGullet: pretentious 'I'm holier than thou' writing. Shocking stuff. Avoid.
3,It works but nothing special.,One of my cats gets goopy eyes sometimes because some of his fur around his eye sticks up and irritates the eyeball and I use this to clean his eye out. Nothing special but it does the job and was good priced.
1,Inconsistent Quality,"Don't even consider buying these. I purchased 8 of them adn the quality varied markedly one from another. The problem was the cut out from the negative areas. Some were cut cleanly, some poorly and some were impossible to separate. The decal ends up in pieces and you have to try (and fail) to match the broken sections together. Very frustrating and the end product looks sloppy."
3,Barley Straw-2 1/2 pounds,I noticed a little change but not the change I wanted. Perhapes it has something to do with the hjigh temps we are experiencing. I have two bags left and will add them in the next week or so. Hopefully I will get better esults.
3,use these as shrimp food,"Well my orange eye blue shrimps do eat them but it does leave behind quite a mess...but well they weren't originally intended as shrimp food anyways...and I think it helps making the water more clear. But these aren't cheap though, you can find organic barley straw on ebay 10lbs for the same price but no free shipping."
3,"This book was good, but not great.","Lacie Allen: I found this book to be interesting, and easy to read, but overall it was not exciting. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys good-easy-to-read stories."
3,DIFFERENT OPENING,"MS. SALA DEFINITELY SHOCKED ME WITH THE OPENING SETTING OF THIS BOOK. I WAS SOLD ON HER ""ANNIE & THE OUTLAW"" BOOK SO I HAVE SEARCHED FOR OTHER BOOKS BY THIS WRITER. I EXPECTED MORE ALONG THE LINES OF DESPERADOS, OUTLAWS, ETC. BUT THIS CONTEMPORARY SORT OF LOST ITS SIZZLE AFTER THE OPENING CHAPTER."
4,Extang Classic Platinum truck bed cover,"When we purchased a used truck, the cover was already installed. I learned too late not to treat with Armor-All and make sure the top is secure when on the highway. I purchased a replacement through Amazon.com which was much cheaper than from the manufacturer and was delivered in three days. Can't beat it for the price and will last forever if properly maintained."
3,Piers Gaveston The Lord of Misrule,"Interesting, well-researched novel about Piers Gaveston and Edward II. However, those who believe the King and his favorite were lovers may be disappointed since the author opts for the blood brothers theory instead. Worth reading if you can find a copy."
3,I luv hanson but the book sucked,"Ok I buy everything hanson cause I am a fan, but this book wasn't that great. I mean the info is not correct and we the fans already know all the stuff in the book there aren't that many pic's. It is just not put together well."
2,Lengthy,"My biggest complaint is that Mr. Riese steps into the shoes of Streisand more often than he should. The research is good, but only as good as the people he has interviewed (the majority of whom hold a grudge against Streisand). There are statements in the book in which he actually tells us her thoughts, this is not only arrogant on his behalf, but unfair. I think he takes too much creative license. Good attempt though."
3,Great guitar/mediocre accompaniment,"Aleman is a wonderful player, and there aresome nice arrangements. A lot of the musicis pretty dull when he isn't soloing though.It doesn't compare well to other small groupjazz of the time. Aleman sings and scatsin a harsh ""jive"" style, and the violin playersrange from OK to not so good. I love swing butdon't tend to listen to Aleman's music often.Try Cats and the Fiddle or especially Spiritsof Rhythm for joyful rhythmic playing, thoughtheir soloists aren't as good as Aleman."
1,Poor Customer Satisfaction,"Upon receipt of the blue enamel percolator coffee pot I discovered that it had a chip on the lid. When I contacted GSI Outdoors via email and requested a replacement lid they told me to contact the manufacturer, who is located in Mexico.Would not purchase from GSI Outdoors in the future."
1,"Missing the percolator, cheap construction","The coffee pot was missing the percolator when we received it. Also, the plastic bubble on top wouldn't stay in place. It keeps coming loose and falling out. I plan to return this item. We found a very similar item at Wal-mart for $14, percolator included."
2,cheap components,"After one weekend and three pots of coffee, the bracket holding the lid to the handle broke. The metal holding it is a VERY thin and bends almost as easy as solder. The basket and tube/base are made from the same material. For $28 you think they could have used a little more rigid metal, especially on the lid bracket since it is opened and close frequently. I am tempted to send it back."
2,Looks can be deceiving,"I was really happy when I first received this percolator. When I looked a little closer I started to get really dissapointed. First off, the viewing bubble is made of plastic, not glass which was expected. Next when I went to put coffee in it, the base of the coffee basket bent. The metal that it is made from is so soft that you can bend it just by touching it. Last when I went to put water into it I realized that there were no markes to let you know how much water to put in for 2,4,6,or 8 cups. I will have to admit though,it sure will look pritty sitting on my Coleman stove........."
2,Lid hinge is feeble,"The lid hinge is a really poor design, and I can see it is going to last about a month.Nothing more than a thin loop of wire on the lid, connected to the handle by a thin piece of aluminum bent around the handle.Otherwise the finish seems okay, and the guts look like they will hold up."
2,"Good overall, but arrived without the coffee insert","Used it for two overnight camping trips with the kids... unfortunately, it was tea only as the coffee grounds insert was a no-show (the product image does show it, but it was not in the package). Overall OK quality - however the tiny metal strap that holds the top in place is very fragile, and comes off way too easily."
5,no electric required!,"the coffee pot is heavy, made well, nice color and works just as it is supposed to. We purchased it after the last power outage so we could still bew coffee. If you need such a pot for this problem or camping I can recommend it highly."
4,A Very Nice Old-Fashioned Percolator,This is a nice little coffee pot for those who like something you can actually put on the stove. The glass top falls off rather easily which can be a little bit annoying. But all in all I was pleased with it.
2,cheap,The material that the filter can is made out of is extremely flimsy. I actually bent it the first time I washed it. Same thing with the latch that connects the lid to the pot.
3,Works fine for now but quality seems cheap,"I was so excited to drink ""real"" coffee when camping instead of the instant stuff. When this arrived I noticed a chip near the top opening. I used it on a recent trip and noticed that the basket assembly is pretty flimsy. Each time I washed it, it would bend easily so now I'm just waiting for it to eventually break. Still, I does make some delicious coffee."
2,You Get What You Pay For,"At first I thought that the percolator works great and makes easily enough coffee for two people. But after about Twenty pots, the lids keep falling off and the clear top falls out now. Also the handle gets very hot!"
4,Good Coffee Pot for Camping,"Took this pot camping for 5 days and it worked well. The coffee was good and I like the size, its just right. Some of the other reviews mentioned the inner parts are fragile and its true they will bend easily. But just a little care is all that's needed. I still like the product and I would still purchase it again."
1,Piece of junk,"I bought this ""classic"" coffee pot but wish I hadn't bothered. The plastic top piece refuses to stay screwed in and I'm constantly misplacing it. The aluminum grounds basket is flimsy, flimsy, flimsy and the bottom part is always warping or coming off. The aluminum clip that holds the lid to the pot is also flimsy; it bends and warps and constantly comes un-clipped from the handle, causing the lid to fall off--this is irritating when storing the pot, but even moreso when trying to use it. Trying to bend it back into shape only helps for a few minutes, and eventually the clip is going to snap in half due to the constant stress of re-bending. The handle gets almost as hot as the rest of the coffeepot, requiring both vigilance and a hotpad to keep from burning your hand.The only good thing I'll say about it is the enamel doesn't chip unless you abuse it. But I will be replacing this product as soon as I can find a good deal on a better one."
2,Not made very well.,I was looking for a sturdy stovetop percolator that would last a long time. I thought since this product was made for camping that it would be pretty sturdy. Not so. The insert that you put the coffee in was only slightly thicker than heavy aluminum foil. It would have collapsed and broken if dropped even once. The enamalware pot came with a chip in the enamal of the spout. We returned it (very easy return Dug out our old camping coffee pot and started using that one. They really don't make-things-like-they-used-to!
1,Returned it a long time ago,Basket assembly was crooked and didn't fit well with lid closed - also clear top of lid is plastic and not glass.
1,broken top,PLEASE.. PLEASE read reviews the plastic/glass top broke within two days this is a waste of money what a shame i never write on these reviews but with this one felt i had to it seems these glass tops are not even built to last PLEASE look else where
3,Product came damaged - had to return.,I'm sure this is a good product but we didn't get the chance to try it because it came damaged and we returned it. We decided not to purchase another one because we received a similar one as a gift.
3,not my cup of coffee,After I received this item and carefully looked it over I decided to eat the return shipping cost and send it back. How it works to make coffee is pretty neat but you have to be very careful not to boil the water. That doesn't seem to be a simple task on a camp fire or a camp stove. When I'm making coffee in the morning I need fast and simple - not burnt coffee. It appears that I'd need an oven mit to handle this. Also the filtering portion of the percolator seems to have awfully large holes. I'd either need to grind my coffee very course or add some sort of filter to the filter basket to catch the grains. So we tried instant coffee (bleh) on our last trip. I'll be on the lookout for a French press now.
3,works great!,"It works great, I tried it at home before I use it camping. makes a great cup of coffee. but, the hinge is real flimsy and worry it will break. I wish I had had bought the Coleman one. but, we'll see."
4,Cool red coffee pot.,It is a decent quality camping percolater and it matched the rest of our camping enamelware.
4,Pushes the envelope,"The other reviews here give you what you need to know. Kayo Dot has crafted together some of the most lush, experimental, and good music I've heard in a long while. The band (now much larger than Maudlin of the Well with the addition of symphonic players) plays around with different structures than the typical Verse/Chorus found in pop music, as well as musical arrangements.Don't pay any heed to Blarno's review. The guy's an idiot. I mean, he's actually suggesting the radio friendly sounds of linkin Park are ""intelligent"" and ""extreme."" I think that says enough for his review."
1,What is this garbage?!,"I'm not really sure what happened with this album...but it is horrible. It's a little emo, a little grind, a little drone, a little jazz...and no it's still not interesting. It's just a mess, and almost like an entire album of one big jam session gone horribly wrong. I hate bands that just throw together as many different music styles as they possibly can without any regard to songwriting and call it good. I'm sure all the band members, their label, and their clueless fans think they're genius, and that's a real shame.The guys from Maudlin of the Well who are now in this band really should be ashamed of themselves for releasing such crap."
1,Tai chi master,"This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It is absolutely not worth seeing. If it was free, it would cost too much."
2,Tai Chi Master,I already forgot the movie. Made no impact. I'm not sure what I expected so I should not be disappointed.
5,This movie is too much.,I love this movie! I can watch this movie over and over. The fight scenes (and there's so many of them) just makes you wish you studied kung fu as a child. The filmography of this is great too! It's like eye candy. Not only that but the storyline is really good too. I would recommend this movie to anybody.
1,BEWARE!,"i rented this movie and while the movie is probably pretty good, Miramax completely ruined it by DUBBING it and not offering an original Chinese track w/ Eng subtitles. Skip this and pick up an IMPORT version on EBay."
1,"Blu-ray, Weinstein Co. is Joking, Right?",Do not waste your money on this blu-ray if you already have the dvd. The improvement in the picture quality is marginal at best and indiscernible at worst. This is a complete rip off; it seems no effort was made to remaster this disc and present it in true high definition.
3,It was crunk and crazy,"I don't know how many stars I should rate this movie. It seemed it tried to rush things and at the same moment it tried to waste time. There were so many fight scenes, there were probably more than 10(and they last for quite a long time too). Some of them I think were put into the wrong places, it looked like they just put in the fighting just to make the movie longer. I don't mind the numerous fight scenes only if they are used well(Like in Fong Sai Yuk). The story itself was actually pretty good, it's about 2 best friends later on turned into adversaries. There were some classic parts where the fights took place, they look really cool and realistic even thought it's on wires. However, this movie was given a lot of good reviews. It will probably grow on me as I watch it again."
4,One of Jet Li's best,"This movie had alot of string affects and had humor, but the creativity of the director to pull this movie off was incredible. The fight scene of Jet and Michelle will most definitely wow you. The overall concept of this movie is very good. The only thing I find is the on DVD and VCD the picture quality is not the great, but you will get into this movie."
5,Tai Chi too?!!?!,"Featuring a cast of awesome wushu practitioners, this is a gem in the Jet Li line-up. And the Tai Chi-esque performance done at the end makes this a fun lineup."
5,Tai Chi Master,"This is actually a re-release of Tai Chi Master. If you can find the original DVD, it is cheaper. Some of Jet Li's most powerful martial arts on film ever. Definitely must have for any martial arts collection."
4,Solid fun,"The original title of this film was ""The Tai-Chi Master."" Lots of fun to be had in this film, showing how two friends that grew up together could end up fighting each other because of their beliefs...one righteous and the other power hungry. Michelle Yeoh and Jet Li provide most of the action, and a great five on five hundred fight is included, showing through betrayel how far the power hungry friend will go."
4,just ok,"this movie looked outstanding, it was actually better than i thought it was going to be. i rented the version with subtitles becuase bubbing pissess me off, then wishing that i would have gotten the one with dubbing. the subtitles were so glared that you could barely even read them. the fight seens were outstanding though, defing gravity, although this is no crouching tiger hidden dragon, the fight seens in the tai chi master are almost just as unbelievable. It was great that the women could fight too."
4,Cool karate flick,This movie reminds me of when I was 16. It was cool then and it's cool now. It can get cheesy at some points but what karate movie don't lol. Jet Li is awesome!
3,good movie,"this movie is very good but like most of Jet Li's flicks the plot and continuity are strange. Worth owning if you are a die hard martial arts fan but, if you are selective, you might want to pass on it. And, Michelle's performance is nothing compared to what she did in Crouching Tiger."
5,wwdavis,"This is an excellent movie. Jet Li is incredible! Good story line, morals, and increible fight scenes. Buy it! Enjoy!"
1,5 stars if the dvd was done right,"I'm referring to the dvd version from dimension. I bought this dvd only to find that some scenes were cut and the only language available was English. There's no excuse with this technology and the retail price ... that you cannot keep the movie in it's original editing and also offer the original soundtrack as well as multiple languages. The movie itself would rate 5 stars but the dvd was so bad I had to give it away and went out to buy the Tai Chi Master dvd. And ... it was cheaper as well as a better experience than I had with the dimension version. If you can, go buy Tai Chi Master, not ""Twin Warriors."""
4,Li + Yeun + Yeoh = Triplet Warriors,"Like great Kung Fu? This is it! If you prefer oringinal language with subtitles, then hunt down Tai Chi Master--but prepare to dig much deeper into your wallet. However, here is a nicely dubbed version with (as far as I can tell) all the action and most (if not all) the soundtrack is intact. If you're like me, most dubbed films (see any US release of Bruce Lee other than Enter the Dragon; or the English tracks on Once Upon A Time in China I-III), are unlistenable. And, most subtitles on Asian releases are laughable (albeit quite entertaining). So, if you are looking for a GREAT martial art film that your friends won't scoff at because they have to ""read it"", one filled with excellent directing, acting (even the extras are great), fighting and a fairly decent plot--get it, own it, and love it. The best of both worlds would be a DVD with an option for Cantonese / English with lots of extras, which would then rate 5 stars above."
1,BOING! BOING! BOING!,"I am really suprised that people actually like this movie. Personally I have come to expect MUCH more out of Yuen Woo-Ping. Most all of the action was done with wires, so there was virtually NO hardcore Martial Arts action (aka. Fists of Legend). Many people think that this is entertaining, but personally I cannot see the enjoyment in it, in NO way does it display the talent of Jet Li, and Michelle.In Conclusion... if you are looking for Harcore Martial Arts fighting, then look past this movie and go buy Fists of Legend, Drunken Master, or even Who am I (last half). But if you don't mind watching Jet Li bouncing around on his head like a human pogo stick (literally), then you might want to check out this poor excuse for Martial Arts cinema."
2,Fair,"This was a mix of Kung Fu and comedy, In my opinion they do not go so well. I did not enjoy this movie."
2,"Not exactly Chrouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon","With all the rave reviews by buyers of this DVD and the praise quotes on the front and back of the case, I expected this to be one of the finest M.A. epics ever filmed. What this movie is, is camp. The humor is over-wrought, and maybe this movie is just a parody of so many cheaper productions. In a word, this movie is disappointing, and even Michelle Yeoh can't save it. When you have seen movies of the quality of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and The House of Flying Daggers, this movie is not worth the viewing time."
4,Tai Chi Master Review,"This was one of my favorite Jet Li movies. Initially , I did not remember the movie by name, but after the first few scenes, it all came back to me, and that's when I really settled in for what I remembered as a great movie. Michele Yeoh is another of my favorite martial arts actors, so I really enjoyed this movie, and would recommend it to any fan of martial arts."
1,Not the right version*,"Be very careful about who you purchase this from. I love this movie and I received the English dubbed version of the movie! The exact opposite of what I was looking for. It's terrible and I couldn't watch for more than 5 minutes because all the good lines in the movie are replaced with short boring phrases. Again, be careful about getting a so-called bargain on this version of the movie."
3,not as good as the hype,"This is a shame that we don't get the chinese version of this. The voice acting this is truly one of the worst ever. It is almost like they are trying to ruin the movie, but enough of that, I'll return to the negative points in a second.Most of this movie is Woo-ping at his best(2 monks against all, Michelle yeohs fights. But the part that I didn't like was the final fight, I hate one-sided matches(usually), the reason I say usually is because Return of Master killer is my fav final fught ever, but this one I ALMOST TURNED OFF AT THE END. If I could have watched this in the chinese language with subs version, there is a good possibility that this would have recieved a 5/5."
1,ughhh,"Between the description, picture of the cover & the fact that Jackie Chan was in it, all contributed to my decision to buy this movie...I'm not wrong often, at least, not THAT wrong. This movie was so bad, I can't begin to start other than DON'T buy before watching some scenes off of Youtube or something 1st!"
3,don't waist your money,"This disc is the Twin Warriors version...menu and all. Why pay $35 for this? Since I already had Twin Warriors, I want my money back, but it's too late. On a side note, I finally watched the Tai Chi Master version, and I prefer the Twin Warriors dubbed english over the corny soundtrack on the original chinese version. The music doesn't fit and is distracting...terrible audio work. Just my opinion."
3,once upon a time in china 3,"very good action,but as all the Martial Art movies being released they need a english dubbed sound track with all the room they have available on them."
3,"Good, but not great","Unfortunately, though this movie was fun, it wasn't as good as Jet Li's Fist of Legend. The martial arts were great, but the goofy choreography got kind of annoying after a while. However, Tai Chi Master wasn't half as goofy as either Fong Sai Yuk, which is a good thing. Overall, this is a very good movie, with lots of great fight scenes, but in the end its value is diminished by the excessively unrealistic choreography."
4,"Excellent info, could use more detailed maps","This book gives you a lot of ideas for a campaign based in Seattle. I was dissapointed in the lack of maps, only ""area"" maps are included. The lack of detail on the maps hurts a GM who needs spontaneous location info, especially when the question is ""What's nearby?"". I'm not saying a huge amount of detail needed to be given, but location of extremely well known buildings would have been nice.That said, if you have the prior version of this book, the two together make a very complete setting. I would also advise acquiring a modern day map of Seattle. This will help you with terrain features and major roads. It will give you a good starting point anyway.If you are a GM running campaigns in other locations, I would still reccommend this. Much of the information can be easily transposed to any urban environment.I would give this 5 stars but for the maps."
3,A matter of taste,"I bought this album because I couldn't hear their first one often enough. As I feared I might be, I'm a little disappointed. This album is much more up-tempo and jazzy, and lacks the finesse of their first, which offered a lot of folk music carefully and reflectively - is that a word? - played. It's harder to play well slowly than quickly, as your piano teacher probably told you. This is particularly true for duets."
1,"very dissappointing, get griers other stuff","This album was lame. It was way , way , way too spacey for me. Sorry. I love bluegrass, this was a little too ""artistic"" for me. Grier's more recent albums (Lone Soldier, house to myself, hootenanny) were great albums and worth the money. This one went in the garbage."
4,Its an encyclopedia,"Has what I was looking for, can't complain it's an encyclopedia. I'm a huge basketball fan, and this helped me with the terminology."
4,"Good product, fair price.","What I like about this cover is the ease of use. Just spread it over your bag and secure with velcro closure in the back. The only ""short""-coming is the cover runs a little short and left a few inches at the bottom exposed especially for user who use a tour size cart bag."
1,Slippery!,"This mat completely misses the point; I used it for the first time this morning to do a beginner Yogilates workout and by mid-way through the work out, the mat became so slippery that I couldn't get the necessary traction for any of the traction-based yoga poses (such as downward dog). I don't sweat very much and have never had this slipping issue with mats that I've rented at a yoga studio, so I'm assuming it's the mat's poor design. Don't waste your money on this."
2,Great musicians past their prime,"I was disappointed by this disc. Jerry's voice is shot and his picking (esp. banjo) is not what it once was. I have a wonderful bootleg tape of Garcia, his wife, and friends playing most of these same tunes in 1963 at the Tangent in Palo Alto, and was hoping this would be similar, but it doesn't come close IMO. Garcia & Grisman are both great musicians, but there are much better versions of these excellent folk songs out there. Hopefully the next CDs in this series will be more inspired."
2,"Nice sound of a slightly hypnotic banjo, but not much else","It's kind of hypnotic, the sound of that banjo. It's a nice sound, but at the half way through every song you start to wish there was something more to it. May be, if you could fall asleep in the middle of every song and then wake up just when it ends... Songs are lame. I didn't take notice on the lyrics, but don't believe there's anything special there either. In fact, in this whole album, there's nothing special there, except that nice sound of a banjo. All in all, it's pretty lame."
5,GENIUS,"This album is superb, from the opening title track to the surprise, unlisted piece at the end. Almost any one of the songs would by itself, in fact, justify buying the whole album. Many fans of the Grateful Dead will see a side of Jerry Garcia that they probably never knew about, and anyone who has even an iota of interest in traditional American and English music will see what real ""folk"" talent -- as opposed to the mountains of mediocrity and posing that came out of the sixties and seventies -- is really about. Like the music fan from Iowa, I found this to be an album that I can enjoy with my father, which is not surprising, because the music is truly timeless, as well as priceless. One can only lament the terrible loss that two entire musical traditions suffered when Jerry died, and hope that David Grisman has more of these beautiful recordings to offer his and Jerry's growing legion of fans."
4,Shady Grove,"If you likes The Grateful Dead and if you like bluegrass, then this is something you have to have"
4,Garcia & Grisman--Fathers to Sons,"This is one of the few times that new age and old age music and minds can come together. Garcia's legendary exploits, blended with Grisman's riffs, bring dads and sons together. One of the few disks that we can both appreciate, together, at the same time, in the same room, and both sit and listen to some music that we both like. It blows both his and my mind that Garcia could be a musician that we both can sit and listen to from first cut to last."
5,More creativity from Grateful Dawg,I'm happy with everything David and Jerry produced and grateful they recorded it! This is more from the trad side of their roots.
5,great album,"i bought this as a gift for my father because i loved it so much. He was a dead head so i figured he'd enjoy this cd, and he did..."
5,This is an outstanding caribbean music of the 90s-- excellen,"Robert and his group has been doing music in haiti for years, he entertain all people and phase of life, his band in an outstanding example of how and all musicians should be. His love for his musics and the Haitian Compas that he created back in haiti is the most superb and outsanding of all ages. The population of Haiti in Miami, New York, Canada, and all over the World should give Robert Martino and his band the most ""Precious"" Music maker of all time in the Caribbean. His constant dedication, pride, and hard work should be complimented by ALL haitian all over the World to have this most outstanding Band. And now his son's Band the T-VICE of haiti will follow his father's example to keep on given the Haitian public the Best outstanding music of the Caribbean World. We wish them good luck ... Kepp going --- the good job to bring us the BEST CARIBBEAN MUSIC, all over..."
5,It's all that,This CD has taken me back to when I was a child growing up in Haiti. Scorpio has taken compas music to another level more so than any other compas band.
5,Perfect follow-up to Children of Morrow,"Tia and Rabbit have reached Morrow after their long ardous journey, but they feel lost in the alien environment and wonder about what life is like back at the base. Along with Ashira and the crew of the Simone 2, they travel back to their old home. HM Hoover has done it again, with a wonderful tale of discovery. Morrow has it's flaws and Tia and Rabbit realise that they can never go back to their old life. Beautiful, lyrical writing by a mistress of the genre."
4,Was one of my favorites as a kid,"I have read and re-read 'Treasures of Morrow' as well as 'Children of Morrow'. As one strangely fascinated by those books/movies dealing with what becomes of people/cultures AFTER the fall of civilization as we know it, this is a fascinating read. It is geared towards young teens but if I could find a copy, I'd buy it for my future children. Why oh WHY have the publishers failed to put Ms. Hoover's books on the re-print list? There is definitely a new and existing audience for her books!"
2,"Excellent conditions, but took too long...","I ordered this book because I needed it for a biology class. I have to admit the conditions were excellent, but by the time the book finally arrived, I had missed three classes. That is three weeks!!"
4,Challenging Read,This is a well written look into the integration of theory and the complexities associated with it. This book should be read by natural resource professionals and advanced students.
3,Great Songs!,This has a lot of great songs but I was dissappointed because I didn't realize I already had most of these songs. I guess I can't complain because it was a gift.
3,"Great Stuff, But You've Heard It Before","Sure, Stone Temple Pilots Greatest Hits ""Thank You"" is full of great songs, but all but one have been released before. So this would be a waste of cash to buy this if you have all 5 STP records. The only new track is ""All In The Suit That You Wear"" which is great, but I would recommend buying it on ITunes instead of dropping 15 bucks for stuff you've heard before."
5,What the hell is up EZEKIEL RAGE's ass?,"ok....to be quite honest, i don't really like STP. i stopped listening years ago. But, i will probably buy this cd since it does have just about every STP song that i do like. i merely was curious about the reviews. so i read some of them and came upon a manifesto written by EZEKIEL RAGE. Look f**k stick, if you don't like the band, then just say it and stop beating around the bush (sarcasm). seriously, how long did you spend in typing up your ridiculously long, gibberish-laden review? a**hole, do you really think you are the end-all music critic? do you really think that just because you know how to use a dictionary, we will all bow down to your colon-ejected review? EZEKIEL RAGE, i want you to apologize to all these nice STP fans now!!! Do it, and i promise to let your mom go home for Christmas....you jerk-off..."
4,Good Stuff,"Great Music , Trying to expand my horizons with regard to new & different types of music Genre`s I listen too.. This fits the Bill precisely in that regard.. Folks I ordered it from , Well they are cool too!Fast shipping and as advertised with the product.. ""Nuff Said""..."
3,Many have said it!,"It's got all the radio friendly songs and that's about it. Oh well at least the tunes picked are good ones. STP were a decent band for sure and evolved over the years into a pretty cohesive song writing unit even though they were a very dysfunctional bunch. Considering they were being bashed in the early years for ripping off Zeppelin, they came a long way in a short time.These tunes have staying power and are classic's for the most part. However theirs a lot of missing stuff here and that's to bad. I guess it is what it is and that's a greatest hits package nothing more.Again these types of Best Of compilations are more for casual fans and not the die hards.If you like the stuff you heard on the radio, you'll like what's here."
3,...,"ezekiel:you are a loser with way too much time on your hands. go write something worthwhile that people are actually gonna take the time to read.and when you're done with that, take a tranquilizer."
3,Just their popular well known songs.,"Just because ""popular songs"" and ""well known"" songs are on a album does'nt neccesarilly mean they are the best.Thats basically what Best of compilation albums are about. Not about the actual music in which the artists should select for the ""best of"" record.Music to much these days is just a big money making machine - its can only be described as ""very unhealthy.""It should of gone like this.1. All In the Suit That You Wear (the new song)2. Dead and Bloated3. Plush4. Creep5. Vasoline6. Interstate Love Song7. Unglued8. Pretty Penny9. Big Empty10. Trippin On a Whole In a Paper Heart11. Lady Picture Show12. Big Band Baby13. Tumble In The Rough14. Down15. Sour Girl16. Atlanta17 Hollywood Bitch18. Too Cool Queenie19. Wonderful20. Long Way Home (Live)There you go - a record ya really will want!"
3,Far From Their Greatest Hits,"I am a true STP fan, and have been ever since the release of Core. I drifted off them with releases such as Shangri-La Dee Duh Dum Didly (whatever), I thought No.4 and Tiny Music were good but the glory days of Purple and Core soar far ahead. For the fan of early STP, this will be considered the Almost Greatest Hits, Minus A Few collection.Songs I would replace are:Down, Wicked Garden, Big Bang Baby, Lady Picture Show, Days Of The Week, and Plush acoustic (waste of time)I would replace them with:Dead & Bloated, Piece Of Pie, Still Remains, Meatplow, Kitchenware & Candybars and Seven Caged Tigers"
5,Not A Grunge Band,"Although Stone Temple Pilots released their debut album in 1992, the height of the grunge era, and they achieved a great level of success during that period, they are not a grunge band. Although they might have a grungy tinge to their sound, they most certainly could not fit alongside Nirvana or Soundgarden. This CD is one of the best CDs ever. It is my first STP CD, and I love it. This band sounds more like Led Zeppelin or Blue Cheer, with a slight Alice In Chains-esque sound, than grunge. I love the way Scott Weiland sings and how the DeLeo brothers play their instruments. Plush is the best song on the album. I could listen to that song all day and all night and still never tire of it. Buy this album if you like Alice In Chains, any 90's hard rock, or Led Zeppelin/Dust."
4,Thank You,I want to know where No Way Out went. I could ave sworn I saw a video for it. if not a video I'd like to see a live perfomance. But th dvd makes up for it's absense. It's one of the better collections an artist has put out to Dvd. I jut wish they had some more off No.4 (No Way Out especially) and maybe te beatles and zeppelin covers. I expected those too. If somene knows if something is hidden on this DVD please say something.
5,Unbelievable album,"Being a Stone Temple Pilots fan, I came into this album with high expectations. All of them were suceeded when I listened to this compilation. Thank You can be listened to track-to-track from beginning to end. That's how good this album really is. All of the tracks are favorites exluding the final track, which is an acoustic version of Plush. For some reason, the entire attitude of the song is lost when it's done acousticly. Overall, you can't go wrong getting Thank You, it's one of best albums of the year."
3,"Good song list, but they could've had more songs.","Stone Temple Pilots are an excellant band, with many great songs to contribute to and I was impressed with the selection made for this compilation, however it was a little short for me...I mean 12 tracks? Come on they could have doen better and added more songs to the mix. I was really hoping for ""Dancing Days"" and other good songs by STP and was dissappointed that they were not there. Other than that the album is pretty good with many good songs on it."
5,Great compilation!,"I was not a huge STP fan, but this CD has most of the songs I like to hear from them. Must have."
3,ONLY 15 TRACKS??? COME ON!!!,"They couldn't put ""Unglued"" & ""Dancing Days"" on here? It's not like they didn't have the room! The music that is here is quite good, but as a greatest hits, it's just not complete. You'd be better off borrowing this disc from a friend as well as the other 5 STP cds & the Led Zeppelin tribute and just make your own compilation. That's what I'll do!"
5,Buy IT For The DVD Not The CD!!!!!!!!!,"You see these people write long diatribes about why you shouldn't buy ""Thank You"", I am gonna give you reasons why you should. First and foremost the DVD is excellent. As long as you understand what bootleg footage is then you won't be dissappointed with it. The videos are great to have, the live footage is awesome, and the thrown in bootleg footage is icing on the cake for the hardcore fan. This DVD contains over three hours of material. For one, it is not uncommon for a DVD that contains that many videos and that much concert footage to cost around 20 or 25 dollars by itself. Therefore it makes the CD the bonus. The highlight of the DVD is the more poplular live acoustic performance of Plush. Some of these conspiracy theory reviews are almost comical. As a person who collects live DVDs, I think it is well worth it."
3,C'mon!!!!!!,"There are heaps of good songs missing!!!Its just the popular ones which got thrown on here.Oviously, you can tell from the dreadful ""Days of the week"" first single of their latest album..This is how it should of been!1. Dead and Bloated2. Creep3. Sex Type Thing4. Plush5. Insterstate Love Song6. Pretty Penny7. Unglued8. Big Empty9. Tumble in the rough10. Trippin on a hole in a paper heart11. Big Bang Baby12.

2,Laura Nyro Tribute doesn't Rock,"While I appreciated hearing some Laura Nyro favorites on this CD, why couldn't the singers up the tempo a bit. Laura wrote and sang a lot of slow songs, but these singers just dragged! Rock & Roll isn't supposed to be this consistently slow."
3,Great picture. Problem with Dolby Digital signals,I purchased this receiver about 2 weeks ago for the optical output. Everything works great until you receive a signal encoded in Dolby Digital. The audio periodically cuts out.
2,"Ok machine, Does not support RF remote as RCA states","I purchased this receiver as a replacement. I recently upgraded the wiring in my house so that I would have the capability to watch Directv from other rooms. Anyway, the manual for this device indicates that you can use an RF remote with it. The on-screen guide for this device indicates that you can use an RF remote with it and that there is a place in the back to plug in the remote antenna that was (NOT) supplied with the device. I have been trying to get clarification from RCA support on this issue. Either they do not read the messages or they do not comprehend English. The four messages that I have sent them have generated responses for everything except an answer to my question. If you plan to use this receiver with the supplied remote and don't ever plan to expand your use then you can consider this, but don't use this receiver for anything beyond standard use (and don't count on assistance from RCA support)."
2,"Good Receiver, Awful Remote","I've had this and the similar DRD450RG for about a month. They are decent receivers, but both come with the same remote that has the distinction of being the worst-designed remote I have ever owned. They are unintuitive, unforgiving when you make a mistake (rather than allowing you to go back one level, you are dumped back to the top), and some basic functions are impossible to figure out without referring to the manual. The receiver is also rather slow to respond to the remote, compared to a Hughes DirecTV receiver I have also used."
5,RCA DRD450RG DirecTV Receiver,The product was as described and easily was incorporated into my Direct TV system. The seller was very responsive and cooperative.
4,NOT BAD!!! But could be better!,"This reciver is not that bad it works very well, Clear picture. Its pretty fast but no athlon 3000+ (lol) the 2 min download and seaching for sat comes on without notice at times right when your wacthing a movie! :( other from that this reciver is GOLD! useful features for the tv loving junky! I love it. good upgrade from my last rca reciver ..."
3,Noisy,"We had a Bunn Commercial Coffee Brewer for 8 years and it made thousands of cups of coffee! When we felt it was time to retire it we bought the same make and model. The new machine makes so much noise when it is heating the water, it sounds like a jet taking off! The old one did not make noise when heating. Don't know if this is normal or not, but it is a little distracting."
1,expensive and no carafe included,For the price you pay for a Bunn like this it is amazing to me that no carafes were included. What is even worse is that no where in the description does it say they are not included even though three are shown in the description. What other coffee maker does not include the carafe? To make it worse when I received the coffee maker there were two boxes where the carafe should be making me think they were inside. I was so disappointed I sent the whole unit back. I had already paid 263 for the unit and they wanted another 14 each for each carafe plus shipping - I dont think so.
1,Worked for only a few months,I bought this coffee machine for our office break room. Our previous machine was also a BUNN and pretty much the same design just a much older model. We bought the first machine used about 12 years ago and it just stopped working. We figured it was a good brand so we purchased the new model. We have now had this machine for a few months and it is already not working correctly. At first the water was not dispensing into the coffee pot in a timely manner and coming out in spurts. We sufficiently cleaned the entire unit as instructed in the manual. There did not appear to be a blockage and now the water is not flowing at all. Very disappointed.
4,Fine Coffee Maker,Made for making a bunch of coffee. Sometimes get fouled up by water. Sometimes think the water is not hot enough.
3,"Pleasant enough, but","As long as Chris Stamey lives, there's no worry that pop music will fade away. This is a nice enough disc - tight harmonies, lots of guitar - but it's just too wimpy (check the ultra-fey vocal on ""NYC""). IMHO, this is the same problem that dogs The Apples In Stereo, The Hang Ups, and a lot of other bands - their range is too limited. Big Star gets cited in just about every pop music review, but what gets left out is that those guys had a chip on their shoulders that came across beautifully in their music (""Thirteen"", ""You Get What You Deserve"", etc.)."
3,Give it several listens,"While I do agree they are poppy, I cannot say they are wimps. The lyrics are far more intelligent than Fountains of Wayne. They sing a lot of songs about girls and boredom and summer time...what's wrong with that? One reviewer commented on the fey vocals on NYC; this is true, but it's only that one song. It's not like being bludgeoned by Belle and Sebastian's wimp factor. There are great guitar riffs and harmonizing that would make this a great purchase for both powerpop and alt-country fans. The single reason that kept me from giving this 4 stars is that every song refers to summertime, it reminds me of summertime, the name of the album is Summertown...my point being, you don't want to listen to this record year round."
1,Mayflies have enthusiasm and love alcohol,"Actually, this album kind of stinks. Initially I thought it might be good and liked the idea of having an album from some hometown favorites, but it just does not deliver. Sorry Mayflies...but please keep up the ethusiatic trying."
2,stupid,"it seems like this gentleman is trying to include 2 subjects in his book that is guaranteed to sell: Jesus and celebrities (Madonna being one). This is simply a man's opinion on what he thinks of a few celebs, thrown in with what he ""thinks"" Jesus would say to them. It's a shame. I do have to admit he is a savvy business man to come up with this concept, b/c he knew lots of people (including myself) would fall prey to it. But it's a good thing Amazon enables you to review and tell others about a product/book. don't buy it, the title is misleading."
1,Blasphemous arrogance ! Save your money. Buy a Bible.,"This book is a embarrassing sign of our celebrity-worshipping times. As a Christian, Stroebel believes that Christ is God Incarnate - and yet he presumes to put words in His mouth! As for the quality of the words, Stroebel makes Our Lord's speech as bland as a Hallmark card. He has Christ quote Paul's letters, as if Paul inspired Jesus, and not vice-versa. May I recommend another book? If you want to know what Jesus would say, there is an excellent account of him in a book called the Gospel of Mark, which can be found in an anthology called the Bible, available here at Amazon. Read the Gospel of Mark, and then read it again. Lather, rinse and repeat daily for the rest of your life."
3,Master of fiction.,"What would Jesus say? The true Jesus speaks:""Think not that I [Jesus] have come to send peace on earth: I come not to send peace, but a sword."" (Matthew 10:34)""But those mine enemies which would not that I should reign over them, bring hither, and slay them before me."" (Luke 19:27)If you believe that a cosmic Jewish Zombie who was his own father and killed himself to save us from himself can make you live forever if you symbolically eat his flesh and telepathically tell him you accept him as your master, so he can remove an evil force from your soul that is present in humanity because a rib-woman was convince by a talking snake to eat from a magical tree you might want to see a doctor."
1,Far Fetched,We do not know how Jesus would react if He were with us today. The book exploits its subject by trying to make people interested in it but it really does not go into much depth.
5,Interesting,"Interesting/well-written book about where neurosurgery historically has stood and what we still don't know. I was fascinated, I'm non-MD and just thoroughly enjoyed it - the best line is that the brain will never be the same once air hits it."
5,when the air hits your brain,This is a beautiful work which can be used as an emotional guide to neuro-surgical residency.Every neuro-surgical resident will feel it is his own story...
5,A very fascinating experiance without being there.,"I became absolutely engrosed with this book as I have had 2 menginoma brain surgury's as well as an entry to drain a staff infection. So having been there 3 times and still being ""intact"" causes me to be so very, very greatful to MY neurosurgeon."
5,Vivid description of a neurosurgeon!,"I'm a neurosurgeon myself.I'm still so moved by the stories told by the author.They reflected the true life in my daily practice and circumstances.They seems funny but actually sad inside, filled with sorrow and tears of both the patients and doctors. I strongly recommend this book to those who would like to participate in this field of medical speciality and to those who would like to understand the real life of a neurosurgeon!"
5,A must read for medical students.,"This book is not what you expect! Vertosick's memoirs are genuinely moving and thoughtful, much more so than any ""doctoring"" class could be. For those medical students who get no exposure to surgery in their first two years, I strongly recommend this book. It gives a compelling view of a specialty that you will not get from your primary-care oriented administration. Also, there is a hilarious chapter about medicine in England which anyone who has learned about the neuro exam will love."
1,I did not like this book,"I did not like this book at all, I did not like the way the author spoke about the patients, I did not like his descriptions of events , he is glib and dismissive and disrespectful. I am sorry I paid for this book"
3,"fast shipping, but wrong spring in box","Moog is notorious for putting the incorrect springs in 6308 boxes. After I received mine (great price and fast shipping from Amazon!)I checked the springs against the spring specs and the springs are 6320s. After looking into the spring rates, I am keeping the 6320s because they may work better in my car. But for the person who really wants 6308 you would be disappointed."
4,Still going strong...,"As I said in my review forTom and Jerry Tales, Vol. 1, I am impressed with how faithful TOM AND JERRY TALES is to the classic MGM T & J shorts. Vol. 5 continues the tradition with another dozen fast and funny cartoons.I've always been a big fan of Halloween and/or ""spooky""-themed cartoons, and there's a trio included here. The best of these is ""Monster Con"", in which Tom faces off with a Van Helsing-inspired monster hunter. The inimitable Droopy co-stars in ""A Life Less Guarded."" There's also an extreme sports theme running throughout the collection, as the classic cat and mouse team compete in skateboarding, cycling and tennis.TOM AND JERRY TALES offers plenty of action (with mild animated violence, if that sort of thing concerns you) to keep younger kids interested, and enough comic antics to appeal to the kids in us all. I recommend getting them all."
4,"Tom and Jerry Tales,Vol. 5",/bought thiss for my 4 year old Grand daughter and she loves it. I enjoyed watching it with her since this was a cartoon I watched when I was a child.
5,Tom and Jerry Tales Vol 5 is a winner,"bought this for my grandsons, since they LOVE Tom and Jerry. This is one of their favorites."
4,Great guide for the new comer to real estate investing,"This was especially helpful for those looking to buy for the purpose of ""flipping"" property for quick returns. I especially found the loan aspects to purchasing properties very helpful and even the type of houses to look for (fewer bedrooms means fewer tenants translates to less wear and tear)was useful. Even though I'm a contractor I was impressed with the useful info related to fixing up properties for resale."
1,Save Your Money,"Save your money. This is about a lightweight book as you can buy on real estate. A synopsis is, buy a house, fix it up, rent it for a while then sell it. Whoopee. Supposedly this is for beginners, but there isn't enough here to educate a beginner on how to progress. If you have never purchased a house, even the one you presently live in, it may educate you somewhat, but there are better books for investors, even beginners."
5,They do fit a Baja...,These wires fit my 06 Baja just fine. I am very pleased with the quality and fit of this Bosch Plug Wire Set. I would buy this product again.
2,Online purchase of car parts: not a good idea,"I purchased these cables for routine maintenance on my Subaru. The car worked prior to putting the cables in... and was bucking and hesitating once the new cables were installed. After a $38.02 diagnostic bill from the mechanic I found out that one cable was bad. Can't say whether the shipping caused damage or the product was defective straight from the manufacturer. Since I wasn't going to wait for my car to sit while a new set came, I got another set from a local auto parts store. I paid more, but it was worth it; if they hadn't worked I could have taken them back immediately for a refund. My car is now purring as it should. I gave it two stars because at least the other three cables worked.I still don't know that Amazon will refund the full amount for the defective product, but I am out the diagnostic fee as well as time and my faith in buying car parts online."
5,watch band for G-Shock,This band is difficult to find for a very durable watch. My husband has had 2 of these watches in 20 years. The G-Shock is his favorite!
3,"American/British influences yes, but no magical mystery tour","Cosmotron borrows from classic and alternative rock, but in its vocals and lyrics maintains the imagination and infectious quality of earlier efforts. The use of mellotrons and way too familiar rock riffs and hooks, at times ignores their own rich and diverse Brazilian music tradition. However, there is a depth and texture to the music which relates well after repeated listens. Best songs are Resta Um Pouco Mais, Pegadas Na Lua, Dois Rios, and Sambatron. Both this and 'Maquinarama' are well-balanced."
4,True Colors,"Sheigh and Clighton, sister and brother---queen and king of Red since the death of their parents. Just recently, dark riders of an ominous Color out of legend have been seen in their realm. What does it mean?So the reader is drawn into this beautiful and beautifully-written fantasy. The description is evocative and vivid. The characters are equally so, and very real, due in large part to the deftly-crafted dialogue, often witty and highly entertaining.But this is a serious story. From the detailed chronicle of the characters' lives, and the often surprizing twists and revelations of plot, the story expands into the much larger dimensions of its underlying theme, and becomes in the end majestic and moving, even transcendent, in the way that all good prose and poetry transcend the words that give them being.I highly recommend this book to all ages from teens to seniors, to anyone who loves good fantasy. _____DWO"
1,Only buy if you are never going to send this in for service...,"Just 5 months after purchasing my laptop, the motherboard just stopped working. I sent my computer in for service on September 19. As of today, December 12, I still have not received my laptop back. Averatec's customer service personnel has been nothing but rude and not one person ever seems to be able to give me a straight answer. I have heard similar stories from other customers with service issues as well. The majority of their products may be decent, but if you ever happen to have a problem with yours, don't expect Averatec's customer service to help you."
1,Bad Company,"I purchased a computer from them as a gift for my wife this past Christmas. The computer did not make it even 2 months. I shipped the computer back to them and they have had the unit for 39 days now and have given me the run around like no tomorrow. To all who consider buying from them, BEWARE. I am awaiting to get my money back in full refund if I can."
3,okay wrestling,"this dvd was interesting but it is a california based wrestling promotion wrestlers such as john cena, samoa joe, and also kazarian started there though so its some what popular but also there are some unkown wrestlers but in this dvd they dont say where they are at they dont say they date whats up with that.the hurricane would say but other than that this was a good dvd"
5,Great Mouse Pad,This mouse pad and wrist pad are great!! I have tried a few other types and this one is really the best. I would highly recommend it.
3,Tricky with Lasers...,"The pad is cool, despite the neon green decals, and offers a solid, large mousing surface. However, my Logitech Revolution Laser Mouse fails to track on the surface of this pad. This is a little odd considering I've played with this mouse and got it working on everything from glossy wood and transparent glass to a carpet on the floor.I'm rating this at 3 stars because the product description should make a statement about performance with laser mice. It is a cool product, and probably does wonders for ball and optical mice... but they should disclose the weaknesses with laser mice."
4,A huge mousepad!!,"Boy is this thing big. But it's nice. I didn't realize how it was made till it arrived, and even then it took a few minutes to figure it out. So I'll tell you this: what you get is two pieces. One is a metal mousing surface, which you can flip over to use one of two different surfaces. Each surface is marked. One is ""speed"", the other is ""control."" The ""control"" side is too bumpy for me, so I use the speed side. This lays ON TOP OF a rubber pad that has a gel wrist pad attached to it. This arrangement works very well. The mouse pad does not move at all, and the wrist pad is perfectly shaped.An expensive, but worthwhile, investment. Works great with my G5."
5,"Great pad, great wrist rest","On the mousepad side of things, this double-sided mat is high quality all the way around. It has aluminum surfaces attached to each side of a thin, but sturdy aluminum plate. I use the speed side since it is smoother, with a Razer DeathAdder that I also recently purchased. Amazon was sold out of these-- the razer store has them.The wrist rest is also just as high quality. It actually uses a memory foam cushion which is much more comfortable than the cheap gel material typically found in mouse wrist rests. It also has a dip in the middle making it very comfortable for long gaming sessions. Keep this in mind if you're considering another gaming mousepad. The wrist rest is optional, but it adds stability (it is a large rubber mat + rest, the mousepad sits on top of the mat part)."
4,eXactMat w/ wristrest by Razer,"Great pad for everyday use and gaming. It does not flex at all. It is soild aluminum with plastic surfaces. Stays in place by rubber feet very well. The control side was way too rough for me and made my G5 mouse grind a little. The only con would be the scratchy noise this style of surface makes when moving the mouse. The wrist rest was a huge plus for me and does not feel too high as it compresses to just 1/2"" when in use. Some do not use it as it is a separate rubber pad beneath the surface which does not slide at all. I play FPS games a lot and found this product perfect for my needs. I would recommend a Steelseries Qck cloth pad for a more quiet surface. Also the logo on the wristrest dissolved off literally within 3 days of use. I would rather not see any of the logos on the surfaces either unless mabey your mouse is a Razer. Great product. Worth the retail price in my opinion."
5,Best Mousepad I ever owned,I only use the speed side but this is the best mouse pad I ever own. It make my Logitech MX Revolution work so well. I can use the mouse on any surface but it works the best on this pad. I had this pad since May 2007.
5,DeathAdder + eXactMat = killer speed,"I purchased this as part of a combo, and it has just been phenomenal. I was using a Logitech Wireless Desktop MX Duo (MX700 mouse) on a plastic mat previously and was getting a little bored with the inherent lag of a wireless solution and the small size and feel of the mat.This mat is just the right size to fit on my desk. I now have a G15 keyboard which is a bit larger than my previous keyboard. The mat just fits between the G15 and the edge of the desk. It isn't going anywhere, either, thanks to the rest/grip and the rubber feet on the mat itself. It's nice and solid and has cleaned up pretty easily when needed. Definitely worth buying."
4,eXactly what I wanted,This mat it is almost perfect. The two different sides (speed and comfort) work great. The only thing I would change is wrist rest. It's a little bit too tall.
5,,"I've been using this mouse pad for a little over a month now, and there's no other way to describe it except 'superb'. Or I guess you could insert your personal favorite superlative. 'excellent' also works nicely.Anyway, the mouse pad itself is actually just shy of being as big as my monitor (19""). So, you can have your sensitivity as low as you want and not ever. run out of room. Ever. Seriously. I personally like the control side the most - for some reason I just feel more... in control or my mouse. Compared to my generic cloth mouse pad that I've had for the past 3 computers , this thing makes it seem as though my mouse is levitating. (I'm using the razer copperhead mouse, by the way.)Oh, and the squishy wrist rest is sure to keep my wrist safe from carpal tunnel for good while. It's really quite comfortable.All jokes aside, this is definitely the best mouse pad I've ever owned. If you've never had anything but a cloth mouse pad (or no mouse pad) prepare to be amazed."
5,Razer Exxactmat Anodized Aluminum Mouse Mat,"Large, sturdy, comfortable and well designed. It looks good, feels better and works great. enough said"
3,tricky with g7 mouse,"I have two g7 mice at home one doesn.t work at all on the mat the other only on the speed side. this is a bit disapointing, the mouse that does work with the speedside makes for an awsome combination though and the wrist support is great. if it works with your mouse than this is the mat for fps games"
4,An excellent product,"A great mouse pad at a good price.I too have the Logitech G5 mouse, and the pad will not work on the ""control"" side (thus the 4 star rating). No matter, as I wanted it for speed, and it works well there. The pad is stable, can be used with or without the gel pad, and makes for perfect mouse action."
4,Mouse pad GREAT!! Wrist rest concrete..,Title says it all.. Don't get the one with the wrist rest. I took it off after I started to lose feeling in my hand.
2,"Works great for a while, but the coating wears off the pad","I bought this together with a Razer Diamondback optical mouse. It works great for controlling high precision mice like Razer makes, however after about 6 months of average use the textured coating on the mouse pad wore off making the mousepad slick which defeats its purpose of using it for control.I would go with a different brand of mat."
4,Razer exact mat,"The Razer Exact mat is a great mouse pad if your into fps shooter games. The big advantage with this mouse pad, is it's dual sides. You have a smooth surface on one side, and rougher surface on the other. I personally always use the rough side because it helps with accuracy. The pad is stabilized with four rubber pads on each corner. They do a very good job keeping the pad in place. Very durable, and the pad is large so you never run out of room for your mouse. Overall 4/5 Stars"
3,it's ok,"Dirty easily and for the price, it's not really value added. But if you can spare the coin then it's a nice accessory."
2,Does NOT work reliably with an optical mouse,"I can occasionally get my Logitech cordless MouseMan optical mouse to work on this pad, but before long, it just stops tracking. Not surprising, since the pad is a smooth, solid black surface. It's also quite large and rigid, so I had a hard time fitting it into my desk's tray alongside my keyboard... had to ditch the wrist pad and turn it sideways. I've given up on it. I guess if you have the space and the right mouse, it would be a nice mousepad, but it was not the right purchase for me."
2,Can't see the difference,I tried to increase my player speed as this add mentioned. I can't see the difference.
3,Suckered...,"Straight up: It's not really worth it. Razer products in general can't really compete with logitech (and I hate logitech). This mouse pad is pretty much a gimmick sort of like the fatal1ty mouse, but less functional.I use lower sensitivity settings on my mouse for UT2k4, HL2, CS:S, etc. With the eXactMat, I am constantly picking up my mouse because the thing just isn't big enough (especially considering thte price).PROS: Solid construction. Does actually provide decent responce.CONS: Gimmicky. You're not going to PWN TEH NOOBS because of a mouse pad. Small and $$$.Get an oversized pad for $10 from CompUSA.GG"
2,"""A mousepad by any other name....""","Although the ExactMat is great for its large area and gel wrist rest, its surface which is touted as being ultra responsive and slick is no better than your average neoprene 'freebie' mat you can find for less than $10. If its a status symbol for gaming your looking for, you've found a great mat. However, if its actual performance you are worried about, then keep looking."
4,nice mat,"I like this mouse mat's two different sides. I don't really notice a difference in mouse performance on one side then the other, but they do feel different, so you can choose the side you like better. One side is smoother then the other. I guess for high end gamers the smooth side may allow for faster mouse movements. The Razer Copperhead mouse does track perfectly with no jumping. The size of the mat is my only real problem. It is just too big to fit nicely on my desk. I don't need that much mouse space. I ended up having to put my keyboard up on the mouse mat ~3in."
5,Excellent Mat,"Well, I totally agree with the last review...Excellent Mouse Pad for Optical Mouse...Huge!!!, 2 sides!(I normally use the fast side and feels great)The best damn pad I ever had...First time feels little weird though..."
5,Busick is the man!,"Busick is great! This is a ""sober desire for history"" at its best. Sean Busick is the man and I would recommend that every American should read this great work of writing. Please share this with your family around the Christmas tree this Christmas. I hope that this book is on everybodies wishlist."
4,Linda Jones pens another masterpiece!,"...Cyrus' struggles with his memories of the war and recurring nightmares, combined with his honesty and code of justice, endeared him to this reviewer. He cannot express his love for Roxanne due to his feelings of guilt over her husband's death as well as the belief that his scarred face could only remind her of the war and the pain she has suffered. When she sets her cap for his bumbling deputy, Cyrus rushes in as matchmaker, believing Calvin will help Roxanne heal her wounded heart.Ms. Jones has written yet another heartwarming story, this time in the tradition of Edmond Rostand's Cyrano de Bergerac. Set in 1868 Texas, this story combines an unforgettable hero and heroine, colorful secondary characters and plenty of sparkling wit to leave the reader smiling for days. Well worth a trip to the bookstore for this one!"
3,UPW Future Shock,UPW is a small promotion run by Rick Bassman in California. Future Shock features UPW wrestlers taking on established wrestler's from around the world including from ECW.Juventud Guerrera vs. Mikey Henderson.Roadkill vs. Keiji Sakoda.Ricky Reyes vs. Hoshikawa.Blue Meanie vs. Navajo Warrior for the UPW Internet Title.Tommy Dreamer vs. Samoa Joe for the UPW Title.Grandmaster Sexay vs. Al Katrazz.Christopher Daniels vs. Rob Van Dam.
3,"Shirley Ceaser, You Shoulda Left Some of Your Friends..","Shirley Ceaser is annointed, but to me she a woman that stand alone by yourself. I felt some of your annointed was lacking from her friends..A few songs that I like are I'm Ready, with Kirk Franklin, I Know It Was the Blood, with Gladys Knight and Patti Labelle, and I'm Blessed, but without Dottie Peoples. As I'm not a fan of Dottie PEoples, which I know she pretty good singing some of her own songs..But that song wasn't for her, and Shirley proved it on the BET Gospel Celebration, that she can do it all by herself.I felt that she should of let Patti out of her own song, she kept on drowning Shirley out, or they should of just let that song out. That song with Oleta Adams, STarting All Over Again, Faith Evans Hurting Woman , and Desmond Pringle Just A closer Walk with Thee. They was alright, but they would been more powerful if sung by herself..And Kim Burrell...Lawd, I gave it 3 stars just for Shirley Ceaser annointed."
5,Jimmy Lee Nails It,"Again. My advice to young writers, you could work your whole life and only be fourth rate to the astonishingly high level James Burke as attained in this genre. And here Jim goes again with a dazzeling read like Crusader's Cross.You've got your leaves the color of worried rust, Clete Purcel's hard snap assesments of scuzzball perpetrators, the pressure cooker reading in the red that is Dave's R's brain and a storyline like iced silk thread through an autopsied liver.In my humble opinion Crusader's Cross doesn't miss a stitch."
5,Robicheaux Winner,"Another great Dave Robicheaux novel by James Lee Burke. Not only are Burke's stories very detailed and surprising mysteries, but even the detailed descriptions of the New Iberia area gives you that hot, steamy feeling of South Louisiana.The characters are very interesting, whether friend or foe, and Burke makes you see them in your mind.I have all of James Lee Burke's books and have never been disappointed in any of them. Burke is right up there with Hemingway and Faulkner."
2,Crusader's Cross,"Book was a Wonderful Novel, But the condition of the Book was misrepresented by seller."
5,Excellent,Excellent work. All of Burke's Robicheaux novels are fantastic. Will end up reading all of them. I have 10 so far.
4,Robicheaux returns,"With much less fantasy thrown in, Burke returns to the world of Dave Robicheaux which resonates with the New Orleans we see on the television today."
5,CRUSADER'S CROSS,"Burke's usual fine work. It follows his recent trending to making Robicheaux more introspective. His wallowing slows down the action, but, it remains well done. It is hard for me to accept that Dave, like myself, is getting older.His buddy, Purcell, is even more over the top than usual. The next book will see Purcell implode or calm down a bit. I hope he calms down. Purcell is an important antidote to the introspection of Robicheaux."
4,Great for any James L Burke fan,Bought this book as I had run through the entire Dave Robicheax series and needed a fix while waiting for the next one to come out. Great read with the same Burke realism.
4,Pretty good writer,"I laugh at my title. It's a saying that was highest praise in J school and in news rooms from crusty veteran writers who handed out praise extremely sparingly. I am amazed at myself for not reading Burke before. All has been said in the other reviews here, but I'll add---he's a pretty good writer!"
3,Wet Blanket,"Much, TOO much, ""weather."" It seems always to be raining, hailing, thundering, or about to do one of these things, or all of them together. Atmosphere is one thing; humidity is another--and this book is about as soppy as it can be.The Pathetic Fallacy lives on.Confusing, glum, and more of those ""supernatural"" touches from previous works that push the book a bit beyond believability.And the hurried end. Actually, ""ends,"" with many left a-dangle, and the apparent villain done in by his sensitivity to public obloquy and an unlikely cornucopia of ""bad days."" Ho and hum. I'd give the book ""Two Pelicans,"" but that's not an option."
2,Crossroads,"I think this will be my last story by Burke. Way too much detail to plow through. I found myself skimming pages to wade through some of it. I think the plot was weak. But I guess good old Dave pulled it together in the end after a few bodies piled up. I agree with the reviewer that commented on Dave's age. I too figured he had to be 64, but sounds like he still had an exciting sex life, in the shower even. Guess he maintains his strength and stamina with excersizing and jogging.I did enjoy the many references of New Orleans and surrounding area as I visited there pre-Katrina and enjoyed seeing some the areas mentioned."
1,Couldn't get all the way through the book -,"I was sadly disappointed to find I did not like this book at all after all the glowing reviews it received here. The characters were flat and the author gave me no reason to care about any of them. Everything was very 2 dimensional for me. I bought the book as a gift based on the reviews here, then a copy for myself so I could get in on the fun. I forced myself through half the book before I just tossed it and promised my father a replacement - something I'd read already and knew he would enjoy. But that's just my opinion - obviously not shared by many."
1,Disappointing and boring audio book.,"I found this audio version of Crusader's Cross to be boring and did not hold my interest at all. It could be the reader, Will Pattons' tone put me to sleep but I found this book hard to follow, uneventful and not worth the effort. I have other James Lee Burke novels to listen to and hope these are better. The rating on Amazon does not reflect well with how I did not enjoy this book."
1,What a disappointment!,Eagerly awaited new novel but what a disappointment! Nothing new here at all just a rehash of previous novels - rich family on the hill with totally mixed up offspring etc. Virtually no excitement whatsoever except maybe one page when Clete goes to Miami? Dave is now married again how long before she is blown away by some low life - the next book maybe?
4,Typical forumla,"As ususal, Burke writes an engaging tale; albeit an overused formula about good ole Dave, e.g. Robicheaux loses his control, beats the heck out of someone from a prominent politican to a low life that deserves it and always, with impunity; or he gets beat up and recovers from trauma that to most humans would be so debilitating that would cause everlasting drooling and eating meals through a straw. But still I read everything that Burke writes. He is the best at turning a phrase or succinctly describing an event or place like no one else. And each book has new phrases and descriptions; to wit: his prose on a Wal-Mart store in LA (or anywhere else) is right on. Burke is indeed brilliant and I will keep reading his writings..."
2,More of the same,"I wanted to like this book, but I was disappointed to find the same themes that have propelled many of his books. Corrupt cops, the noble poor, and a wealthy family that is barely above pond scum on the evolutionary scale. On top of that there are facets of the story that go unexplained. Characters and scenes that upon reflection make you wonder what purpose they served other than to make the bad seem worse and Detective Dave seem more noble or tragic. Finally, the prose (that I so loved in his earlier novels) is stale. I can not recall a passage that was fresh. On the other hand I think that nutria only made it into the book once."
1,"Slow, boring, and no plot","Wow. I have been trying to find some new authors in this genre and Amazon suggested Burke so I gave him a try. He is so caught up in excruciating detail of describing eucalyptus trees, meandering nonsensical diatribe, and pretentiously inserting the word 'antebellum' at every turn he never actually gets around to telling a legitimate story. There is supposedly a serial killer on the loose and also a 40 year old who-cares cold case murder being solved, but you wouldn't know it for all the distractions.This book is too long on mind numbing filler and way too short on plot development. A complete rip-off for the Kindle price.Skip it."
4,He can be an aggrevating man...,"Well, he can. In Crusader's Cross, he took me on another trip to the Big Easy just days before Hurricane Katrina hit. Over the years, I have seen the city when I traveled through the historic streets and visited the parks and bars while I solved tangled mystreys with Robicheaux. I learned to love it. When I viewed the devistation that the storm caused, my years of spending time there with Dave made it feel very personal."
5,I use it as a moistuizer,I use this product externally as a moisturizer and for getting rid of facial blotches and aging spots. It works great for that - on my face and hands. It actually gets rid of those brown mole-marks that appear with age when applied for a number of times directly to the spot. It's also good for sunburn - takes the sting out and helps the skin go tan.
2,"No Strategy, Just Brief Bios of Famous Football Legends","I bought this out of print book from one of the Amazon.Com used book vendors thinking that I didn't have much to lose at such a cheap price. Maybe it's just me but when I see a football book with a title that begins with ""STRATEGIES OF,"" I automatically assume the book will be about playcalling and other X's and O's that helped the great ones win so often. If that's what you think you're getting with this book, forget it. All this book is is a compilation of brief bios of some of the most famous coaches of all time such as Tom Landry, Vince Lombardi, Knute Rockne, Bear Bryant and Don Shula. The only strategies covered are overviews of some of the coach's contributions to the game of football and a few comments taken from magazines that reveal their occasional psychological strategies. Basically, you could enter the coach's name in a web browser and probably find the same information you would in this book. I should have saved my money."
4,"A Great Book for Any Writer, Published or Not","This is a very informative but entertaining book for any writer. It is full of great advice and awesome ways to flesh out characters and various other elements of your novel. The secrets of finding time to write in a hectic schedule are also shared among other things.No one could ask for a better book on writing. My one biggest fear with books on writing is that they'll turn out to be dull and boring, thus negating any useful information that it may have. No Plot? No Problem! has a fun tone to it. But it is also holds true to the spirit of NaNoWriMo (National Novel Writing Month).There were many moments when I laughed or smiled to myself while drinking in the advice. This is the perfect guide not just for writing a novel in a month, but for writing a novel period."
5,Fabulous book!,"I've written more than 60 novels in the last thirty years, and the process in this book is bizarre, skewed, and utterly fascinating. It helps strip away the panic and pressure and encourages you to jump right in. I highly recommend it!"
1,Phooey!,I bought this book when I was feeling blocked and planning to participate in NaNoWriMo. I hated it. It was filled with ersatz information and was childish and unprofessional. I read it in about half an hour. Don't waste your money on this one. Go buy a coffee and a bunch of file cards or paper and just write.
3,Reasonably entertaining,"Though his flippant style begins to grate on your nerves toward the latter third of the book, it is a reasonably entertaining read. It is another in a long string of books that should be magazine articles, stretched out into book form, for financial reasons, that contain little of any useful information. For useful content, look elsewhere. For a reasonably entertainng read, it's worth the money though.Roger"
2,Could have been much better,"Books on writing generally fall into one of two categories: how-to/instructional or inspirational. No Plot is primarily of the latter type. It provides motivation for writing a 50,000 word novel as part of the now defunct National Novel Writing Month (NaNoWriMo).The content does an excellent job of inspiring you to begin your novel in the timeline suggested. However, much of the book felt like padding. It lacked the tools that would help you write at this breakneck pace such as idea lists for plot, character, location, etc. I located such information in ""Writer's Partner: 1001 Breakthrough Ideas to Stimulate Your Imagination"" by Martin Roth. If you're going to write your novel 1st draft in 30 days, I would suggest that you'll find the Roth book more useful."
2,I want my $10.17 back!,"Dear Chris, The title was alluring, but I remained skeptical. I read the reviews...I was swayed. Purchased the book. Read it. Not impressed. That's it? I read your story and laughed -- apparently anyone can write a book. I still want back my $10.17. Thanks!"
5,A great start to your finish . . .,"This book provides witty and inspiring insight that helps you write that novel. I agree with Chris Baty when he says that the only thing holding people back is not having the deadline and motivation to accomplish their goal. 50,000 words in 30 days can definitely be done, and although you will have a book that needs some work- at least you will have a story . . . and at least you can scratch ""write a novel"" off your bucket list. I sat down with a vague idea of what to write about- and I was pretty happy with the results. Can't wait to do NaNoWriMo next year! Already have another vague idea . . . !!!"
4,Needed fir NaNoWriMo,"This is my 3rd year for competing in National Novel Writing Month and I bought No Plot? No Problem! to help me with insentive. It is infomative and helpful expcially if a person is new to the concept, but I am not, but it was worth reading anyway."
5,Motivation and Laughs...,"As I multi-published author, I wasn't certain how this book recommended by a writer friend would help. But, help it did!Motivating and humorous, it challenged me to stop thinking so much about how hard it would be to write that next book and simply do it!I'm in the middle of my own NaNoWriMo this month and also plan to participate in November.Thank you, Chris, for such a great book and concept.We'd love to see you at the Pikes Peak Writers Conference here in Colorado!Jodi Andersonaka Jodi Dawson"
1,Guide? Where?,"Let me preface my review by saying I have participated in NaNoWriMo a few times - both in November and the new ""Camp"" version.This is the ONLY Kindle book I have EVER returned for a refund. It was THAT bad.I did not have an issue at all with the quality of writing. The issue is that the ""guide"" is simply not there. I was looking for some sort of strategy or suggestion at how to go about writing when you have no plot. Perhaps the advice would be to flesh out one of your characters and see where that takes you. No such luck. As others stated, this is pretty much a long-winded version of the FAQ on the site.There is no guide here, which is what the title promises. It is more of a meandering recollection of what worked in the past for the author. If it had been titled ""No Plot? No Problem! The Story of NaNoWriMo and How I Win the Competition"" than the book could have delivered on its promise."
5,for every wanna be writer,"In found this book extremely helpfull. It got me motivated to actually start writing my book that I have been ""writing"" for 2 years now. Great for anyone who is having trouble getting that first word, sentence, pharagraph or chapter started."
3,Not quite what I expected,"I think I was expecting some ideas on how to start a novel, how to find a subject, how to make it exciting and readable. What I got was a pep talk and some strategies for writing 50,000 words in 30 days, whether those words made sense or not. I could write 50,000 words in a month, but that doesn't mean my novel would be interesting. It just wasn't quite what I expected."
3,Where are the results?,"I have been unable to find that Chris Baty has written anything of greater significance than this admittedly easy to read, and entertaining, writing manual. Of the participants he mentions in the book, I can find no evidence that they have published anything of significance either. So what is the point? If by their works, you shall know them, to paraphrase a significant book, and there is nothing on record, well...."
5,Great Job!,"This is a great book for writers. I intend to read it every year in the latter part of October to prepare for NaNoWriMo - National Novel Writing Month, started by the author, Chris Baty. This is the greatest way to leave all perfectionism and revising behind for 30 days and just write. No one is saying that you'll have a novel ready for publication in a month, but what a great way to just write and keep going and have a first draft to work with at the end of the 30 days of November!!As a writer I have applied this idea to all of my writing. And even with shorter pieces I find it easier and better to just write the first draft from beginning to end. Then I have something to work with when I go back and revise."
3,good... but the web site is better,"The book does a nice job of going over the basics, but you get all the same information, and more, from the NaNoWriMo web site. I am a big fan of Chris Baty and the NaNoWriMo yearly event, and I own this book and enjoyed reading it, but I think it is more for fans of the site than a required manual on how to get a rough draft of a short novel done in 30 days.Certainly a quick, and enjoyable read."
5,Go get writing!,"""No Plot? No Problem!: A Low-Stress, High-Velocity Guide to Writing a Novel in 30 Days"" is such an amusing, self-lifting, and informative book. As a writer, I take my writing and writing process very seriously. I never would think of approaching the process as author Chris Baty does. It is very relaxed in its approach, and I suppose it would need to be to accomplish something so tremendous in such a short period of time with ones' sanity intact. I only found this book after becoming a member and participant in National Novel Writing Month (NaNoWriMo), and I read this book in no time flat. If you're participating in the November event, then take the time to read this book. If you've wanted to write a novel, and need motivation to do so, then give this book a try. Remember, your first draft won't be superb, but it will get you going. I recommend."
3,"Not bad, not great","This book isn't a great book, but it isn't bad. The author's writing style is pleasant and fun. He carries you along through an entire book even when there isn't much to say. But the most important thing isn't the book, or the depth of the book. The important thing is the message.Let's face it, this book is mostly a cheerleading book. It tells you that you CAN write a book in 30 days. Then it gives you a few good pointers and helpful ideas. There is nothing totally new or earthshaking here, but there are a lot of basic points that are of tremendous value.I guess I was wishing for something a little more profound, but what is here is very accessible. Most importantly, if you follow the techniques that it recommends, you will find yourself doing things as a writer that you never imagined.If writers can get the main message of the book, that it is possible to write a book in 30 days and follow through on the techniques, then this book just might change their lives."
5,"50,739 words later ...","March 5: I picked up Baty's book and started reading it. March 6: I started writing my own book, doing most of my writing in the evening when my toddler was asleep. April 3: I typed my 50,739th word to conclude a rough first draft of a story I've been planning to write for the last nine years. April 16: I was diagnosed with attention deficit disorder.Hey, if I can stay focused on writing a novel for a month, you can too. Definite credit goes to Baty, whose practical, enthusiastic book kept me feeling optomistic about my ability to finish. ADD makes me easily distracted and if I'd tried this with a negative attitude (""I'm going to write a book in a month that I haven't been able to finish in nine years?""), my attempt would have been doomed from the start. But Baty's week-by-week description of the monthlong process helped me keep my doubts and my inner editor at bay and keep going.Now if he would just write a book to nudge me through the rewriting process!"
2,do not buy the Kindle version,"I don't think this is a great general-purpose writing book, however it is a good guide if you intend to do Nanowrimo or if you plan to write a novel in a month. But I would caution NOT to buy the Kindle version. It has so many errors that it's basically impossible to read. I don't mean typos (though they're there, too); I'm talking about huge glaring errors like chapters being cut up and misplaced, paragraphs being interrupted by bits of other chapters, etc... It's basically all scrambled. Amazon should not be selling this Kindle version as it's basically a defective product."
5,Get yourself writing,"I am amazed how much fun I am having with NanoWrimo ...In this book Chris Baty, tells you, yes you, that you can be a novelist ...I am already up to 37,000 words in my book (expect to hit 50,000 within the week) and am having a ball.Try NanoWrimo and buy the book .. its great encouragement.His idea to ""turn off your inner editor"" really works.Trust me its fun.Great read and a quick one.ed davis"
4,A can do guide to writing a novel,"The guide is inspiring. It takes the mystique out of writing a novel. The guide confirms my belief that if you want to be a writer, write. I can hardly wait for the November Novel Writing Month. For a first effort, I think the on-line support will be helpful. Although it may not be a great result, on December 1 I'll be able to add ""novelist"" to my resume. This book will get you started, no problem!"
4,You didn't buy this book yet? Problem!,Most definitely the resource of all resources for NaNoWriMo. Get yourself a copy before November!
5,"An awesome read! 50,000 words in one month is not impossible!","Chris Baty should write comedy, because I found this book very witty and amusing. As ""The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"" is my favourite book, I really take comedy seriously!!Chris covers all the highs and lows of writing 50,000 words of drivel over a typical November. As expected about 1% of participants get published, get the fast cars, movie deals and sell their souls for a cheeseburger, while the other 80,000 of us just do it because we love it, or must obey the ""word-fairy"" on our shoulders.Excellent book, great read, inspiring, cheap for the price and the wisdom in it. I thoroughly recommend it, and if I wasn't doing a part-time masters over the next 2 years I'd do the NanoWriMo thing myself. However, I'm pacing myself to do it in Nov 2009!! (you know, just before Armageddon)"
3,More Shakin',"The folks at Collectables have put together a compilation of ""The Killers"" early material from SUN Records. Almost everything on this package is available on other compilations. I must say that the quality of the package is much better than most of the earlier releases with the same material. If you are a JERRY LEE LEWIS fan, this is a compilation that you may want to include in your collection simply because it is better quality. A few selections (""Jailhouse Rock"", ""End Of The Road"" and ""Sixty Minute Man"") are not available on other packages."
3,Godsmack....NOW with 20% less crunch!!,"As I said in the title, the band Dropbox is basically the same as Godsmack without the heavy in your face guitars and drums. It is more melodic and straightforward rock than anything Godsmack has offered. Why do I compare these two you ask? They are cut from the same mold. Sully Erna, lead singer of Godsmack, signed this band as his first acquisition to his vanity label under Universal Records. He also plays drums on practically the entire album. Listening to the harmonics and rhythms, you can definitely hear the parallel between the two. Also, Sully pays respect to his new friends by comparing them to Alice In Chains on the CD package. I will give them that. They do have the high/low harmonies and melodic progressions of ""Alice"" but the song writing is not even close. Overall this CD is just ""OK"". It is good for the listener with everything. It is even good for the occasional listener. But it is best for the polished rock radio listener."
3,I didn't know Alice In Chains had a new album...,"This album was spearheaded by Sully Erna (of Godsmack fame) on his new label Realign Records in conjunction w/ Universal. The album is well written and is enjoyable, but its like listening to a bad Alice in Chains album. It reminded me of that band 'Craving Theo', another Alice in Chains knockoff. And just when you think you don't hints of Chains, you hear Godsmack. Its really not a BAD album, just far from original. It should please fans of both bands incl. Nickelback, but isnt the greatest hard rock release of the year."
1,Koonk,This album each song sounds the same as every other heavy metal band that's out there. A definate letdown.
2,Average at best,"Classic case of a bigger, already established band trying to bring up others with their own label used as clout. If you really listen to Dropbox, the lyrics are formulamatic and uninspiring. The play far too many powerchords and the few guitar solos in the CD are basic and do not show any over-abundace of talent. They have an early 90s throwback sound to them that just doesn't work for me. I would recommend you spend your money elsewhere. Without the aid of Godsmack promoting them they would never surface on the mainstream, too thin on talent."
2,Not very good,"I read a promo from Sully Erna about a band by the name of Dropbox, it stated that the singer's voice would make you think Lane Staley (Alice in Chains) had risen from the grave. I figured it wasn't true and I was right. How's the cd?1. Wishbone 6/102. I Feel Fine 7/103. Nowhere Man 6.5/104. End Of Days 7.5/106. Forgotten Song 6.5/107. Take Away the Sun 5.5/108. Run 6/109. Unfold 6.5/1010. Fall Away 4/1011. I Told You 5/1012. Nobody Cares 4.5/10With a single with the name ""Wishbone"", which makes no sense at all, (lyrics need to make sense sometimes), and songs like ""Forgotten Song"", a tune that is in alot of songs today, not saying that they copied. ""Nobody Cares"" is an acoustic song to close out the CD that will just plain put you to sleep. This cd just didn't click with me, the songs are not that catchy nor or they really that good. It's a cheap CD, so it's up to you if you want to take a chance or not.Alice in Chains is dead and gone, that's for sure."
3,Average Riff Rock,"The fact that Dropbox guitarist Lee Richards used to be in Godsmack and that 'Smack frontman Sully Erna plays drums on the record, might lead you to write this off as Godsmack Jr. The opening Sabbath-y heavy riffs of ""Wishbone""(which reminds a lot of C.O.C.'s ""Albatross"") and ""I Feel Fine"" say otherwise. Too bad the band doesn't stay in that particular vein through the entire release though, instead straying into the oft tread Alice In Chains-grunge style realm(not surprisingly, Dave Jerden is listed as the producer). There are other strong points; singer John Kosco's Cornell-like smoothness on ""Forgotten Songs"" and the dark atmosphere of ""Take Away The Sun"" are both anthematic, without sounding contrived. The acoustic ""Nobody Cares"" shows this band's and many others' biggest problem; how to give a nod to your influences(AIC-ahem!), without sounding too much like them."
3,Good but doesn't stick out.,"To me Dropbox's debut album is great to listen to but doesn't stick out as a cd that you consiuosly put in to listen to. It's merely good background music. The rock/metal equivalant to elevator music. It's not bad, but it's not great.2 songs stand out. Wishbone and Forgotten Song. Tracks 1 and 5.These are excellent songs that I love to listen to. the others despite how many times I've listened to the album, I can't even remember the names of.The only reason I bought this album was because it's best track (wishbone) was featured on the Atari Transformers game. That's it. If not for that I probably would have left this on the shelf and bought another ACDC or metallica album."
5,Great CD!,"I've been waiting for this cd ever since I saw heard the song ""Touche"" of Godsmack's ""The Other Side"". I went down to the store this morning and picked up this cd by Dropbox. Every song packs so much energy and the lyrics are great.I highly recommend this cd to anyone who is a fan of rock or metal."
5,shazam,"I lost a lot of albums in Central Park over the years and if there was any album that I thought I had to have, this is it. Sure, there are better groups out there, but it's got all the bells and whistles."
2,Not this one,Not too bad but not a keeper either. I have heard some local garage bands that were as good. Like I said not bad but nothing special either.
3,I don't get it....,"Somehow Creed were labeled Pearl Jam rip-off artists. As a fan of both, I don't hear it, but anyway...people blasted Creed for supposedly ripping off Pearl Jam. These guys are obvious AIC rip-off artists and no one is saying anything. Wait, I think I know why...they suck! If they were any good, people would voice their opinions.Anyhow, there are only 2 songs worth listening to, Wishbone and Forgotten Song. Make that one tolerable song and one worth listening to. Don't get me wrong, it's not horrible - but it's great, either."
5,Back to the old days.,"This Album is a must-have for 80's rock lovers. Dropbox is a hybrid of modern rock and 80's style heavy metal. Keep in mind, there IS a reason why Sully Erna signed this band: They're awesome!-Dave"
2,Canon SLR Vs Sony Prosumer,Was considering buying the Sony DSC 838 but decided on the Canon after a couple of weeks with the Canon I wish I would have stuck with the Sony. I have a Sony DSC f-707V and it produces very sharp pictures with nice contrast from the Zeiss lens on it. The lens on the canon cannot produce a photo that comes near the quality of the Sony. I have not found a lens at a reasonable price to replace it as of yet perhaps a better quality lens will improve the image I've been getting. I'm glad I didn't sell the Sony I have.
3,Disappointing dynamic range,I am disappointed by the poor dynamic range of the digital rebel. If the light on the subject is not uniform pictures are ruined by washout. Fujitsu models offer better dynamic range.
4,Great Camra!,"For a simi-pro camra this is the best I have came across. Good photos, symple to use and good over all except battery life when taking mass emounts of photos, but that is why I have an extra one.If you can't afford the newest version this one is a good choice!"
4,Excellent Pro-sumer camera but...,"When I saw a digital SLR below $1k for the body I knew I was going to buy one. A friend of mine has the 10D and loves it (he's a pro) so I bought the Rebel. I'm very happy with the camera. It works exactly as advertised, but most of the time I use it as a point and shoot type camera. That being said it's not the best point in shoot camera. I always seem to be adjusting something to get the picture the way I want it. Maybe that's the way SLR's are? My Kodak DC265 is a much better point in shoot type camera (remember back when the DC265 use to be a pro-sumer camera?). However, the ease of use and speed of the camera I believe makes up for it's short comings as a point and shoot camera (which it's not intended to be anyway).BTW I have the Canon 28-105mm II USM lens on mine. I find myself wanting a wide angle lens and occasionally a macro lens."
3,Pictures are soft,"This camera is not as good as I was lead to believe. The pictures are too sofor slightly out of focus no matter what I do. The focus system is difficult to use and it doesn't work well. Operation is pretty slow too, picture to picture and start up times are not very impressive, I was hoping for a faster camera with my upgrade to a DSLR. I wish I had kept my F717, which was made of metal, this camera seems very cheaply made. The included lens is a little bit distorted in the corners, and also seems cheaply made, already rattling. The Sony is overall better."
2,"Cheapo, low quality aka ""pro"" rebel.","Camera quality is disaster. It badly fits in the hands, it unsteady and cumbersome to operate. The image quality is so-so. Mid-tones are very poor, color rendering as a cartoon film like. All colors are ""pop up"", it is not a photography tool to my view. I have tried it against 5M Sony f717 and it blew it out of water in every aspect. Moreover, the ""stretched"" to 6M images from Sony are looking better. The 18-50 ""lens"" is so embarrassing that Canon should be ashamed to market such khe-khe, lens (with failing front element and unsteady focus). Some one has be really inspired by Canon's advertising movies to pay $1000 for such ""camera"". It new feels like came out of trash box.Before review it, I would recommend take it in to the hands and try along with something else."
2,For beginners only,"I bought this camera 2 weeks ago.It's kind of fun,but just for beginners only! If you are a serious photogrpher, don't waste your money on it!"
2,Great When It Works,When I received this from Amazon and went thru several test shots I was amazed at how good it really was.
2,Better be a pro,"This camera takes great outdoor pics, but indoor pics are consistantly underexposed. I am experimenting with all the controls and modes, since most of my pics are indoors of my children (during the winter). When you start using the manual settings, they are not consistant. It's a hit or miss deal (trying to set the right exposure for indoors). I exchanged my rebel for another, only to have the same results. It is not a point and shoot camera for indoors. My advice is if you're an amateur photobug, wait and see what Canon's competition does or wait till canon fixes the problem with underexposure on these cameras. I gave it only 2 stars because of the underexposure and having an ""auto"" position on the mode dial that doesn't create good photos automatically."
2,Underexposure Problem,"I owned the original D30 prior to this camera and wanted to upgrade so I could keep my lenses. While the Digital Rebel has much faster auto focus and a better pixel count, it has a significant underexposure problem. I've taken about 1000 shots so far and the majority are underexposed, especially those taken indoors with ambient light and even many taken with flash. On some lenses, such as the 28-135 IS USM lens, it underexposes at maximum zoom while indoors - even with the exposure compensation control at the highest level! Too bad - otherwise a terrific SLR, but I wouldn't use it for any important shots. I expected more from this camera given the experience Canon has with digital SLRs. My small S400 does better! Hopefully Canon fixes this issue, but until then I'm looking elsewhere for a digital SLR."
2,Style over substance,"I wanted to like this documentary/fantasy, but I didn't. This was Mexico as an idealized vision, not as a reality. I found very little of the ""real"" Mexico of the time, but a lot of long,lingering camera shots of posed and sometimes awkward citizens. The photography WAS beautiful, but it was rather emotionally ""cold"" and for me, anyway, failed to capture the warmth of the people. The music that took the place of words in this silent film, was not very Mexican-sounding and became annoying after a short while.My favorite part of this movie was the last 15 minutes or so, when it began to move into a new direction - the Mexican Revolution. At last a plot! If only the entire movie had been on this subject."
4,Great deal,"I purchased this set almost a year ago and am pleased with it. It is a good deal, but the duvet(not comforter-it's just a cover for your comforter) is a little too big for a queen sized comforter, get a king and it fits like a charm. For the price you can't really expect to get real suede, so it does feel a little artificial and does not clean easily. My daughter spilled some juice and a little bit of food on it once, but it comes out with a little bit of stain remover. It doesnt stretch, fade, or fray anywhere. It looks great on the bed and the colors are beautiful, very comfortable to lay on. This is great for the price."
1,Microsuede has a wierd feel,"I returned this item because the Microsuede had a fake texture and the comforter looked kind of cheap. It seems like it would have been hard to care for, too, since it wouldn't have done well in the washing machine."
3,Very attractive; thin,"The microsuede is very nice and the pattern is very attractive. The duvet comforter is very thin, I needed to get blankets to put under it even in the summer to keep warm. For just appearances, this set is wonderful. For function it is not the best."
1,Don't buy it!!!!,"I am extremely dissatisfied with this Duvet Set. It is discripedas sky blue with chocolate. It is actually a light teal bluewith milk chocolate. The dark brown color you see in the pictureis much darker then what you get. Also the quailty is just horrible!It is very thin and has no real backing, just a very thin material.It's not worth half of what I paid at $129. I could have gone toWalmart and gotten a better quailty product then this. I basedthe accessories in my room on the dark brown shown and now I havea mismatched room. Needles to say I'm extremely unhappy!!!!!!!"
1,Print too small,"The print was very small in this book. I can read most print, but this was small and crowded. That is the only problem I have with ordering books online. Barbara Adams"
4,Amazing woman,A little slow in the beginning and then becomes increasingly fascinating. To have lived this independent life in the time she lived was what was so interesting .
3,Amazing Detail but rather fawning,"Well-written, amzing research and detail. At times a bit like a magazine piece and maybe too much praise for Jane Digby. Still, definitely enjoyable and I learned something about 19th century European attitudes."
3,Don't want it to be bumped,"It's too heavy to stay in if bumped by something so just get it for a place that won't be bumped. Other than that, it's good"
2,not flush against the wall,this does not sit flush against the wall even after the wall plate had been removed; there is still a little gap remaining; i do not like this and will be looking for a replacement
3,"Good, but disappointing","Newbold covers the basic TOC concepts and applies the thinking processes to project management. He also has several helpful insights into implementing TOC in an organization. It is good information, but Newbold can't seem to decide what he is trying to accomplish with the book - teach project mgmt or implement TOC in an organization. There is lot's of good information and worth reading, but the information is a bit fragmented. I get the sense that Newbold has taken a set of isolated lectures and tried to make a book out of them. The materials need a class room discussion to really sink in. As it is, the concepts are rather isolated and disconnected. It probably makes perfect sense to an experienced TOC consultant, but was a bit over my head with only having read two TOC books prior to this one."
2,"Slow shipping, wrong size","It took 3 weeks to receive this item, it is the wrong size, shipping costs was very expensive and doesn't pay for me to send it back. Now I am stuck with it. Will look for the correct size somewhere else. I have found that if the item ships from someone other than Amazon, don't buy it! Poor customer service."
3,"Light, ok for travel","Light, yes. But it being widescreen makes it a little ""bigger"" to carry, although it still fits in a standard backpack. After about a year and a half of this the fan started to weaken and now I can hear it run (it's pretty loud). Overall, not bad, but I wish the fan wasn't dying on me."
2,Save Your Money Buy Used,"Roy Firestone was at the Florida Mortgage Brokers TradeShow selling his book with proceeds going to charity. That was one of the few good things about this book.With the exception of Arthur Ashe the book is a shallow work that does not have much substance.His work on Wilt Chamberlin is focused on the sexual exploits of Wilt or so called exploits. He fails to state that Wilt was the world's greatest athlete and accomplished a feat, scoring 100 points in a game, this is beyond belief. Especially in an era when basketball was basketball and not a touch me foul me game. If Shaq thinks he is fouled Wilt was literally assaulted.I paid $20 and can find solice that the proceeds went to charity.Save your money and buy a used copy from Amazon."
3,What Happened??,Destiny's Road is certainly a page turner however once you reach the destination you go what? and start scratching your head. The premise is good with challenging ideas regarding life on an alien world however after stating that Jemmy's goal was to find the Cavorite and the end of the road why did he stop for 27 years - so close and yet apparently too far. I also found it disconcerting that Dr Nogales recognised Jemmy almost straight away yet no merchant had in 27 years of being served food at the Wave Rider. I felt the end of the book was rushed. Why was Barda discussed but not reintroduced as a character. It was almost as if Mr Niven could not make up his mind as to whether he was writing a stand alone book or the start of a series. The book reminded me of most movies - at the end you are pleased you saw it then you start thinking about the plot holes and it detracts from your enjoyment.
1,A good idea but...,"Larry Niven is no doubt a genius when it comes to concepts. ""Footfall"", ""Ringworld"", ""Tales of Known Space"" and ""Neutron Star"" are examples of his power as a writer of other worlds. This is not his best work. In fact, it has the feel, beginning to end, of being written for a deadline. There are technical flaws through out the book (If one must suppliment the diets of humans, why not all the other earth-life animals that wander this new planet?) and an inconsistancy that leaves the reader wondering what the point is. It has some good points. The entire concept is a good one. The references to other science fiction writers and scientists are many leaving a strong feeling of conneciton with the Earth we know. But the rest seems to be little more than the framework of a story, poorly thought out and executed in haste. If you want great science fiction from this master, read ""Tales of Known Space"" or ""Footfall"", but skip this contract-filling paper weight."
2,Not recommended,"""Whatever happened to the imagination that created Ringworld?"" asked another reviewer. I saw a few glimmers in this book, but it's pretty lame. I finished it, but barely."
4,Niven's back on track.,"I've been a fan of Larry Niven for 25 years and have accumulated quite a collection. I was afraid he was dried up, having gone to the literary well too many times; happily this isn't so! He's back on track with Destiny's Road. I'd place it on par with Lucifer's Hammer (newer works) and The Mote In God's Eye (one of the oldy but goodies). It's the type of book that draws you in and is hard to put down when its time to. Of course, it can't be placed on the same pedistel as the Ringworld books, BUT WHAT BOOKS CAN? Larry - when is Hollywood going to turn one of your works into a blockbuster?"
4,Another strong Niven book,"Niven is one of my favorites, because he seldom disappoints. Very compelling protagonist, realistic, difficult choices, interesting and consistent world. Thought provoking."
4,Pretty Good,"I have never read a Larry Niven book. I really enjoyed this, he reminds me of Jack Mcdevitt. I always enjoy books about different people trying to make their way in their own interesting world."
4,Good SF. Average Niven.,"Destiny's road is indeed a nice book to read. Definitively not the best of Niven but nice anyway. The theme of the colonization is again brilliantly mastered while the ""Otterfolk"" issue has not been enough depicted. It lacks however some suspense and drive due to the lack of credible, dangerous threat."
3,"A Space Western with ""Horse Whisperer's"" plodding pace....","This is probably not the first Niven novel I should've read..... Is it just me or are the Speckles (plants) and the Chugs (animals) more interesting than the people???? Jemmy's motivations are fuzzy at best, sort of blowin' in the wind until near the end where he turns Johnny Appleseed on us....I don't buy it....Jemmy never has the strength of purpose....."
3,Good - but not what we have come to expect from LN,The story line has potential and the plot is well founded - but the execution disappoints. There are too many holes in the narrative and an unacceptable number of errors - did anyone actually read this before it was published? Niven says in his introduction that this book has taken him a long time to write and it certainly shows.But you will find likeable characters in here and you will come to care about some of them. There are flashes of the Niven we know and love all the way through this. With more care and craft I am sure this would have become a great Larry Niven.
3,A solid effort from Niven,"Niven builds a lot of mystery into Destiny, the unusually well-realized and believable world where this epic is set, and decoding its secrets kept me turning the pages of this long and sometimes oddly-plotted book. Some sections of the episodic narrative introduce too many characters too quickly, and Niven's often cryptic dialogue can be hard to follow. But the hero is appealing (even if it's a little silly the way women keep throwing themselves at him, sometimes in groups of two or even six (!)) and the architecture of the story -- and the world itself -- stays impressive."
4,"Very Good, not typical Sci-Fi","I have never read a Niven book before but understand why some people were suprised by the book. Technology is not emphasized as in many science fiction books, but instead, the issue of colonization and the human condition. I disagree with those who were bothered by the 27 year jump ahead in the book. It seemed a necessary component of the plot. The book was definitely different than what I expected but still enjoyable, and I would recommend it. The book also had a good ending, tying up almost all major loose ends and did not seem like a set up for a sequel. By the way, after reading the Kirkus review at the top of this page (and other Kirkus reviews), I plan to never read another Kirkus review of any book I want to read, they always give away the entire plot and spoil the book and the ending."
2,Another book Niven didn't bother to finish,"I enjoyed Destiny's Road for about 80% of the book, then it seemed he just tacked on an ending because his publishers were bugging him to finish the book.Some spoilers here, but you read through the whole book and it covers several years of the protagonists life then suddenly just before the end of the book, 20 years have past, he apparently got married had kids and then Niven throws some tragedy his way. Like we are supposed to care about characters we didn't even know about until that chapter.This book shared the same fate as The Ringworld Throne, it seemed like there was a large part of the book you missed. I really enjoyed Niven's earlier books, but his later ones leave much to be desired."
2,Such a disappointment!!,Do not waist your time on this. Larry Niven has written many other wonderful novels. Pick any other one by random choice and you will have a better read than this disgrace.
3,Nothing New Under this Alien Sun,"Larry Niven wrote this book, but it contains nothing you have not seen from him before.""Destiny's Road"" is one of those well-trod metaphorical ""road"" books. Boy takes journey, becomes a man, and rights great evil. And, that is OK. However, this story gets mired in several places. The 27 year hiatus the main character takes within 50 pages of the pat ending drove me nutty.I fully expected something as original as ""Legacy of Herot"" and I found ""Legacy of Herot"" (again)."
2,Average to low standard for Niven.,"I am a great Niven fan so I was dissapointed with the flat characters in this work. From the UK the world seemed the way we imagine Orange County. There was no sense of wonder and I found it difficult to care about the protagonist. The dialogue was repetitive and lacked depth. All that said, Niven at his worst can still entertain. Good book for a rainy day."
4,"Always liked Niven, Always will...Destiny is great","I liked the spin-off of Leagacy of Herot, and although Destiny is a little slow to start, it is always because he (Niven) is so careful in setting up his worlds. I like the adventures along the Road and the (hopeful) follow up that the whole book implies. We all hope for social change and I think that this is what the book is all about."
2,Under-par Niven,"Usually, a new world from Niven will keep me up all night reading. Destiny's World, however, gave me some good night's sleep. The new world is d.u.l.l. Little in the way of gosh-wow stuff, which we expect from Niven. Instead, a rather pale imitation of the movie ""Wizard of Oz"".Usually weak on characterization when writing alone, Niven shows less interest than usual in illuminating character, motivation, etc., and none of his characters have any ""inner"" life. They are stick figures and evoke no interest or sympathy.All the background for the world, which might be of interest, is presented in cursory form without any real examination. One gets the impression that Niven knew it didn't make much sense and was trying to fuzz it out"
4,A Good Larry Niven...but not a Great Larry Niven,"While it's encouraging to see any new book by Mr. Niven, his last few books have been a disappointment for those of us who remember when RINGWORLD hit the SF best-seller lists. Both the recent return to the Ringworld - in THE RINGWORLD THRONE and the MOTE sequel, THE GRIPPING HAND, were pale variations on stronger first works. DESTINY'S ROAD, while enjoyable, seems to be almost written in shorthand at points, leaving the reader to fill in the blanks that a longer book would have enriched with the kind of detail and characterization that were once Mr. Niven's hallmark"
1,Dull,I recommend that you not waste your time. I have found that the quality of Niven's writing has diminished greatly in recent years. The ideas for this book should have been turned over to Robert Silverberg. He would have made an entertaining story out of.
2,Story that starts off with promise/ends confused.,"I have read the last 2 books written by Niven: the Ringworld Throne and Destiny's Road. Both were very difficult to follow in that the stories did not flow. It was quite apparent that the Destiny's Road story simply never came to crystal clear fruition for Niven who states in his dedication ""I turned in a draft of Destiny's Road in August 1996, four years overdue. I knew it was an ambitious project, and I flinched from it.""I do not believe Niven ever recovered from that flinch, as the story line becomes very disjointed and hard to follow or picture in one's imagination. I was very sad about this, as the Integral Trees, Smoke Ring, Ringworld and Ringworld Engineers were masterful works, creating great anticipation for more originals from this author. I hope there are a few more imaginative stories yet to be created by him."
5,Pure Niven!,"I've read all of Mr. Niven's books and I was NOT disappointed with Destiny's Road. It's pure Niven in style and content.Yes, there are a couple of weak spots. No, I don't mind them.In 351 pages Mr. Niven has created an alien world, an alien society, several diverse human societies, and the complex relationships tying them all together. I'd kill a prole for a look at the next Destiny novel. In the mean time ""No birdf---ing allowed! It's the law!"""
1,Disappointing,"Nothing happens in this book, except that the main character wanders around haplessly learning that there are other cities nearby that do things differently from his own home town. The few interesting, or exciting parts of this book ended too quickly and the main character's misery of hunger and servitude was boring and lasted far too long. I lost track of how many times the main character was deliriously hungry, tired, or ""speckles-shy"". I got tired of reading about how he stumbled into a village, or prison camp, gets married, or laid, then gets sold, or chased out of town."
2,Careless writing and poor characterization mar effort,"I found this book nearly impossible to finish, an amazing feat for somebody who reads 50 novels a year. I kept thinking I would pick up the writing style of Niven, but that never happened. The book has several major blunders in the text, confusing the two main cities of (Spiral Town and Destiny) on more than one occasion. The 30 year lapse in the story where the protagonist simply sat around and raised a family is unbelievable for any style of fiction. I kept thinking that Jeremy (or someone) would reveal his fundamental understanding of the economics and social experiment in progress, but alas, that seems to have never been fleshed out by the author.I assume Niven has an editor but i wonder if anybody read the book carefully before it went to press. A good editing and some rewrite would have improved the book greatly."
1,One of the worst books ever,"I've read almsot everything Niven has ever had printed. He's one of my favorite authors from my youth.That being said, this book was so painful to read that it made me physically angry.The plot wanders aimlessly, at times almost like entire chapters had fallen from the book binding. I kept finding myself backing up in the book trying to see where I missed what was going on, only to discover that IT WASN'T IN THE BOOK. Years would pass unremarked from one page to the next. Characters disappeared, never to be mentioned again, new ones appeared and treated as if they'd been there for 100 pages.Not simply a waste of time, but a literary insult to the reader."
1,Do I have to give a star?,"Having read alot of Niven, his Ringworld series, he crashlander stories, the ARM stories, and others, I gotta say this book feels nothing like Niven. Most of his books have really good plots and characters, and more importantly stuff other than massive amounts of sex happens. It seemed reading this book that Niven wanted to try his hand at making a sci-fi romance novel. Instead it feels like an outline for a bad porn movie."
1,The worst,"This is the worst Niven book I have ever read. I have read most of Niven's books and loved them! Don't waste your time with this one. I kept reading, hoping it would get better. It never did."
2,Don't let this one keep you from his classics,"I have to agree with most of the negative reviews. The first book I read of Mr. Niven's, a collaboration with Mr. Pournelle, The Mote in God's Eye, is still one of my favorite SF books ever. Do yourself a favor and read Lucifer's Hammer (again, with Mr. Pournelle), Ringworld, and The Mote... Forgive him Destiny's Road."
2,Not one of Niven's better works...,Slow reading for the first ~ 250 pages and then the ending is weak
2,Not one of the author's better books.,"This is an average book, and not one of the author's best. The plot seems to ramble. Without a prelude to explain the planet, the characteristics are left to be picked up in bits and pieces. The author creates a planet with essentially a 32 week year, but then forgets where he is on the time-line. A man leaves home for a few months, and then returns to find his wife remarried with a child, a major evolutionary leap in 240 years. There are far too many improbabilities (e.g., people don't visit, and are not aware of, the next town, a bicycle ride away). the main character wanders, leaving various people behind, and the book seems to end without a solid conclusion. There are major gaps in the account in the later part of the book after minute detail in the early part. Perhaps the author plans a sequel, but I doubt that I would buy such a sequel."
2,Road to Nowhere,"The book takes one interesting idea (an alien planet that cannot be explored because technology is low and the native life forms inedible to travellers) and makes a mess of it. Two-thirds of the way through, he gets so bogged down in a boring plot that he simply jumps twenty years, giving the main character a wife and family that we know absolutely nothing about, and any attempt for the reader to empathize with the protagonist is gone or taken an interest in the story-line is gone. Whatever happened to the imagination that created Ringworld?"
3,"Wonderful idea, poor execution and editing","Oh, why, why? So many good ideas, so many errors. Why can we assume that no one, in 27 years, would recognize fertile speckles at Swan Lake, and then have Jemmy assume that if he scatters speckles along the Crab, the next time there is a merchant/settler disagreement, the settlers will recognize and cultivate the speckles? It just doesn't make sense. Far more likely that some merchant, maybe one who has been a prole at the Windfarm, recognizes speckles plants on the Crab and takes appropriate action.Anyone notice that it was stated that outside the Crab, speckles are free--yet Jemmy and Harlow discuss that speckles have to be bought. Give me a break."
3,Dont judge Nivin by this cover,If this was the first book i had ever read by nivin then i would have passed him by. It start out promissing and does try to build but the entire plot is not spelled out. It has to be gathtered and sifted from the stories and charceters in the book. The story is the moral reason why on group is kept in virtual slavery to prevent disaster from stiking the rest o fhte colony. The virtual stagnation of the city dwellers who continue to rely upon earth technology and the old ways of doing things and the attempt to change these things in the last part of the story by the main charcter. Read it if you must but try to buy it second hand.
2,Starts out good but.....,"I love Larry Niven. Well I love the OLD Larry. This is not the old Larry. A great idea for a story ends up flat on it's face. A shame really. This book REEKS of a outline. As Steven King once said ""the last measure of a truly bad writer"". Say it ain't"
3,Niven- you can do much better,"Interesting book, great ecology, and plausible science; easy to read for the most part. The down side? The characters changed too rapidly, some were introduced but never fully developed, the main character takes a two decades nap by the end of the road before actually getting to it,the ending of the book appears rushed. Overall, fun reading for a rainy day, but as a fan I have a bad aftertaste."
3,Interesting World but poor character Interaction,"Larry Niven creates and interesting world in this book but it is hampered by poor character interaction and way too much sex(it isn't graphic but I counted twenty instances of the main character getting lucky). I'm not being prudish, some is fine, but eventually you begin to wonder if the book is less Sweeping world building sci-fi and more Harloquinesque sci-fi."
4,Different but good,"This book was a change of pace from Niven's usualy writings (Ringworld, Known Space) but very enjoyable. I loved exploring this new world. A worthwhile read.Very different pace, but deep characterization."
2,What a dissapointment,"This was a disapointment after his two other book set on Avalon. The caracters are two dimensional, hardly human at all. I couldn't identify myself with them, they talked and acted with the unmhuman hero-psyke wich Niven, unfortunatly, often use. The biosphere was interesting however."
3,"Niven's latest ""tour"" revives, interweaves old themes","I always think of Larry Niven as a world-builder first and a writer second. The compulsion to read Niven (and I admit to being compelled) is the chance to explore another fascinating and carefully-constructed world. Destiny's Road, for me, closely echoes the Smoke Ring novels -- the lost colony motif reverberates powerfully. The protagonist, in many ways, recalls the reluctant hero Jaybee Corbell of ""World Out Of Time,"" an ancient piece of Niven history. While not my favorite Niven novel of all time, Destiny's Road is still a good read, and introduces a new world filled with possiblities."
2,what can i add to the previous reviews ?,"this book was so borring, and stupied. it took me a month to finish and i had to skip lot of pages at the useless end. so bad i can't beleive it, what id the book all about cooking ? is this what SF had become to be. ican't remember when i read a good book by niven recently, i keep trying, but everytime i'm more and more dissapointed."
1,horrid,"Horrible book. Nothing happens, almost zero action. I am not a big SF fan, and tried this book as an intro to Niven, who I'm told is one of the best SF writers around. This book was enough to ensure I'll never read anything by Niven again, and almost enough to put me off SF as an entire genre. It's that bad."
1,Not up to par for Niven,"I have read and liked many Niven novels. This one was a clunker. Either I wasn't paying enough attention (not usually a problem) or there were major jumps in logic being made with no explanation. It's like the characters would make intuitive leaps but I didn't have enough information to leap with them. Very frustrating. And even so, I drudged on to the end of the novel in hope of some higher explanation for everything. No such luck. Feels to me like Niven was just trying to get this one out on deadline and had given up half way there."
2,Not up to Nivens standards,"The most telling thing about this book, was the forward, where Niven speaks of the book being 4 years overdue. While parts of this book are wonderful, he's certainly created yet another fascinating world, most of it seems to have been dashed together at the last moment, probably to finally just get the book done with, so he can move on to something he cares a bit more about. The book just doesnt flow. I was constantly rereading parts to see if I missed a crucial tidbit, and usually realised that no, i hadnt. There really was a huge gap in the storytelling. Now, I love Niven, The Legacy of Heorot is one of my all time favorite books, Ringworld, Mote etc... I've loved them all...I wish I hadn't read this book though. Niven proves here that he isnt infallible. He's turned out a decidedly sup-par effort."
2,Below Par from Larry Niven,"Larry Niven usually tells a great story. Destiny's Road started out with so much promise, but half way through the story you got the feeling that the writer just wanted to get it over with. The ending held no real surprises and was rather trite has the ""truth"" of the road is told."
1,Slow - Plodding - Disjointed,"This book was a big disappointment. I have been a Niven fan for some years and found this book to be among his worst works. He states at the beginning of the book that his draft for this book was 4 years over due, and I can't help but wonder if he needed to ""get this to the publisher quick"" because of an advance. The plot starts off rather well but quickly becomes rather pointless and disjointed. Although the story takes place in the future and on an Earth colonized world... This book is far from traditional ""Sci-Fi"" of any sort.As other (most) reviewers have stated... this book was a waste of money and a waste of time."
1,Not great,"I like Larry Niven, but not ALL his works. This was not one I particurally liked. I found it boring. The story was mostly about mundane stuff. It was a good concept, a man finding out the truth behind how his world works and beating the odds against him, but the story didn't grab me."
2,certainly not a classic,"While I admire Larry Niven's conceptual genius, his writing of late has left me wondering. Destiny's Road had a subject that could have developed into a classic, instead it entered into a trivial and most confusing dialogue, I found myself frequently reviewing earlier parts of the book in order to grasp the intent."
2,Playable only on CRT TV's,"Only displays in black&white on every LCD HDTV I've tried . Works perfectly on the older CRT TV's in the house . Other than that issue , pretty fun , and play is exactly as I remember . Warlords with catch is still a blast !"
3,From beach to yoga,"Cafe Del Mar was always about cool beachy vibes, the feel was sometimes decadent (perfect for 7am come down sessions). The change came after vol.8. To me it wasn't so much about Jose Padilla leaving, I think it's more to do with their court case which they won (free from Universal Music) so from vol.9 onwards we see new CD artwork and covers, Bruno had little choice but use their new but limited in-house artists. They were more about new age and easy listening. This 25th anniversary album is the perfect example of that, and with so little variation it can easily be used for a yoga session. I liked about 1/3 of the songs here. It's definitely more spiritual with nothing dark in it, even the CD covers nowadays, the sandy beach and the blue sea are replaced by images of new age philosophy graphics and buddha. Just a bit too clean for my liking."
4,Cafe Del Mar atmosphere!,"One of the best compilations.But DISC#2 is not so...Track#1-Private Session [25th Mix]is the BEST!Very Special Anniversary Package and Booklet.-------------------------------------------------------------Good albom,good music.Enjoy of Cafe Del Mar!!!"
2,Don't waste your money.,"This collection is crap. Since when did Cafe del Mar become the home of cheesy vocals? Perhaps that's why Gracenote named it's genre as ""Easy Listening"" rather than ""Ambient"". There are about 2 decent songs on each of the 3 CD's. The vocals on these songs are sacharine to the point that I had to forward to the next song in disgust. Don't buy this collection."
1,Do not ORDER!,I ordered three of these items for Christmas presents on Dec. 14th and was notified on Dec. 20th that they would not be shipping them. They actually canceled my order. I do not trust this company and have no idea why Amazon allows them to list a product they do not have.
4,Finger- and Teeth saver!,"Great tool to open those impossible-to-open jewelboxes that all the electronic gadgets come in. Spares you getting your fingers cut, your teeth broken, not to mention the frustration involved in reaching the product. Originally I read the review on similar tools by David Pogue of the New York Times who mentioned the Dual-X. This tool has 2 blades that enbale you first to slit the package and then get the rest of the job done MUCH better than scissors, knives or perhaps, in desperation, hammers!"
3,Tough for left-handers,"It's about time that someone created a tool such as this to open those tricky plastic packages. The idea is great, but like with so many other things, this tool is difficult to use for those of us who are left-handed. I'd love a left-handed version!"
1,Useless junk,"I thought this would be a nifty gadget, safer than a knife and easier to use than scissors. Also figured that for ~ $5.00 I couldn't go wrong... So much for that theory. This thing is completely useless. It's very poor quality, dull, and ergonomically awkward. It simply won't perform as advertised. After trying to open two packages I tossed it into the garbage and went back to my Leatherman tool. Don't waste your money!"
3,Not quite as promised,"It is not as easy to use this as they imply in the advertising. The puncturing part of the tool works fine, but many times the plastic on a package is too thick for the other razor edge to cut through. I end up having to use the puncturing blade to open the whole thing."
5,Package Opener Review,This does make it a lot easier to open plastic sealed packages. I've had no problems with it.
1,"opens X's, perhaps-but not any packages","I purchased this for Christmas for my elderly mother with severe arthritis in her hands, packaging opening is a real challenge for her.The singular positive comment I can make: it was good for a laugh, as all of us gathered on that holiday failed to be able to open ANYTHING with it, including it's own clamshell packaging!I absolutely DO NOT recommend this to anyone except as a lesson in futility. (If you happen to need one!)I do recommend an ordinary box cutter/utility knife, which is what I intend to purchase for my mother to make up for this, and wish very much that I had just done that in the first place!"
1,Completely and utterly worthless - HUGE dissapointment,"I was excited and bought three. They are completely useless and worthless.Simple scissors are much, much better."
2,Not impressed,It didn't seem to be any faster to open the packages than the way i was previously doing it.
1,DANGEROUS! Get the Open It Device.,"I thought this was AWFUL, and I AM coordinated (-;I MUCH prefer the Open It device and will get another of that device... not this thing."
2,Only good for the thinnest bubble plastic,To be honest......a regular box cutter works better....as you tend to use the break open blade more than the main slide blade as it cannot cut through very thick plastics easily.I got 2 of these to see if they were a better option.....alas they are NOT better than my good old 3M and EXACTO box openers.Methinks I only break it out to use to not feel horrible that I wasted some money on these.
4,works very well,"I've used this product almost a year. It's a LOT more useful than scissors to open boxes and plastic packaging..easy to use and sturdy, with a nice heft. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because I had to buy a new one when the blade broke..as far as I know, the blade cannot be replaced."
3,I'm sticking with scissors,"I thought this would be the greatest tool as more and more items are coming packaged in clamshells and theft resistant packaging. I was surprised when I received it that it, too, was packaged in an impossible to open clamshell package!I've tried to use this on a few packages and I've never had great luck with it. The blade seems to get stuck cutting through the packaging rather than gliding through.I guess I prefer the scissors because you can use the leverage of them to get through thicker packages."
3,Utility Knife Works Just as Well,"First, I was a little dismayed that the OpenX Dual-Blade Package Opener comes in one of the hard-to-open-plastic-packages-I-bought-this-dang-thing-for. How is that for irony? After struggling to get the package opener out, I tried it out on another package...it wasn't as slick as I thought it would be, but did indeed do the job once I got the initial hole started in the plastic. It's a little tough going around corners with the opener, but eventually, it did work. I would recommend saving your money and just getting a good utility knife."
3,On the bland side of the street,"There's a great satire in here somewhere, but unfortunately the prose is just plain colorless. Didn't the author's editor see the missed punchlines??It's a funny story, but I can't say it's a great book."
4,"Funny, but almost scary.","As a fan of wacky humor a la Carl Hiaasen, I found this book quite good. Given the reality of some of the insidious license agreements out there, however, some of Townsend's ideas are eerily close to the mark! No doubt, this comes from his expertise as an Intellectual Property lawyer. If he can either grab enough material from that field to write others or extend his style to other areas, we may have another Hiaasen on our hands. The courtroom interrogation of a German Shepard near the end had me in stitches."
2,Great original idea -- awful writing,"As a Silicon Valley intellectual property attorney, I was excited to read this book. The story is original and holds a lot of promise -- indeed, the book starts out great. Sadly, the tale runs out of original ideas after about the first 50 pages and the poor writing becomes even more evident. The one paragraph description of a love scene toward the end of the book is one of the worst ever written. I did struggle to the end, but could not recommend anyone else do the same."
2,Neat but...,"These are really neat, but without being able to choose the band, it's really not a very good price. You can use your own vinyl records to make a product like this in less than 5 minutes. look it up online."
5,Another Bargain! Worth it for the Bonus Features Alone!,"I know a lot of people prefer the episodes of Season One to those of Season Two and I think I miss some of the ""stock company"" that didn't return for Season Two, but there are still laughs to be had in Season Two and, of course, the rapport between Bud and Lou remains unshakable. Since the show only lasted two seasons, this completes the set. As with the Season One package, the generous Bonus Features are astonishing. The candid interviews with Chris and Paddy Costello cover a lot of subjects not contained in the Season One interviews, like goofing around on the Universal lot when they were kids, the Bud/Lou chemistry, their breakup, home life, etc. And, as before, amazing home movies - some sound, most color - from the '40s and '50s. Lou Costello's love for his family is palpable in the footage of his kids' birthday parties over the years. It's truly a rare glimpse into a legendary star's family life, away from the (studio) cameras."
4,bud and lou,"as a fan of everything bud and lou did together i enjoyed watching season two as i have not seen it since the seventies, and i do recommend it to other fans.i do however want to state that is not as funny as season one was but what the heck it sure beats anything on tv these days.thanks"
4,"SMALLER, EASIER, FASTER","I have used this program for many years through many upgrades and find it to be one of the easiest and intuitive to use and navigate. I admit I may have a little different perspective since I'm an accountant. Some people have problems with programs because they don't have the background in accounting to understand some functions. I have used Multiledger to keep the books of several clients companies and have never had any trouble doing anything that was needed. I have also recommended it and trained others to use it. It has all the features needed with much smaller files and faster performance. An added benefit is that it has both Mac and Window versions and the files are interchangeable, so you can send you file to your accountant with no trouble."
1,This game sucks,This game has graphics that look like they were done 8 years ago. The sound is horrible. The guy walks so slow I fell asleep. There are no vehicles and no fun. The best part of this game is when you stop playing it!
4,Fascinating Sounds For Varied Stage Images,"Canada's R. Murray Schafer, one of the most creative musicians in North America, created a series of eleven startling non-operatic theatrical works (some of them meant for outdoor performance)over a period of more than twenty years. The music ranges from New-Age/Minimalist simplicity to complex post serial expressionism. The sonic ambiance of waves, rain, thunder, echoes off of cliffs etc. becomes part of the composition in the outdoor ones.If you are in the mood, you will find this disc of highlights from four of the works both engrossing and haunting. (A different performance of some of the sections of AND WOLF SHALL INHERIT THE MOON is available on the Canadian Music Center's two disc Schafer set.)The musicians are first rate, and the sound recording, Great Blue Heron wing flaps and all, is excellent.Nifty liner notes !"
1,Too small to keep your betta healthy and happy,"Please do not buy this bowl for a betta.Firstly, it is difficult to keep the water at a good temperature. Bettas are tropical fish and like warm water (I keep mine at 80 F). A heater cannot be used in a bowl this size, and since it is so small the temperature will fluctuate more rapidly than a larger tank.Secondly, it will require frequent water changes. Not only is this annoying for the owner, it is stressful for the betta. If you don't change the water frequently, the fish's wastes will build up and make your fish sick.Thirdly, this bowl does not give the betta enough room to swim."
1,The picture speaks for itself.,"If any person with an IQ above 20 looks at the stock photo of this picture, they should surely be able to determine that this bowl is not appropriate for a betta, the bowl is barely longer than the fish... There is literally no where for the fish to go. It must remain in the same basic position day in and day out. Has anyone ever heard of muscular atrophy? When you don't move for a long time, your body begins to eat your muscles. The fish in the photo is very likely to die a boring, painful death because it literally has no life."
1,are you kidding?,"I own several bettas, and I'm not a hardcore advocate for putting them in a 3-5 gallon tank when my .75 gallon bowls keep my fish happy and healthy, as long as I clean them regularly. I hate to be preachy, but this could never be an acceptable permanent home for a betta in any circumstance. If you want a decorative fish set-up, bigger is better. If you can't afford to go bigger... don't get a fish."
1,Is good for something...,But that something would be a little fish gel candle.But you could get cheaper ones at the dollar store.
1,Not a good bowl,"I wish there was an option zero stars. Just look at the picture and you can tell that betta is not happy, a happy betta would not lie on the bottem of the bowl. It is much too small, after just adding the pebbles takes up almost half the space and if you want to add decorations, forget it, there is absolutely NO ROOM!!! Also if you want to have it out for everyone to see, it is very easy to tip over. If you want to have a betta I would reccommend at least 1 gallon."
1,Too small,Looking at this product makes me cringe. First of all betta fish should not be put in this. I would say plus or minus 1 gallon tank for the fish but not something this small. This is almost as bad as keeping the fish in the dish he came in. Whats the point. I really do hope that people use this more for maybe a water plant or just decoration but without the fish.
1,I am not a betta bowl hater. This just isn't a betta bowl,"For the price this is a ridiculously useless item. You cannot house a betta in this, because it isn't much larger than the tiny cups they're sold in at pet stores. If you can put your betta in a bowl/vase that holds over 1 gallon of water and has a heater, I believe your betta should be okay. And so, I am not one of those people who screams animal abuse at betta bowls. This bowl allows a betta absolutely NO swimming room. For cheaper, you can buy a large enough vase to put him in. Just don't put him in this tiny contraption because even you will be miserable watching him in there."
1,Unbelievable fish bowls,"Was thrilled to find this bowl on-line. Turned out to be the same cheap bowl that Wal-Mart sells for $.97 each. Could not believe it was the same bowl, just 3 times as expensive. Thought it would be better quality or at least larger."
1,dontbuy this,do not buy this product i have this toy for my child and that is the exact bowl it has artificial fish with my sons kit dont buy this i work a petsmart u need at least 1to 2 gallons of water for a betta fish the fish will die in a week or so becouse it cant move in the tiny place and i think they to the bowl out of its original kit which has artifical fish that swim around in it i reapet dont bu this item!!!!!!!!!Glass Betta Bowl - Fluted Ivy - 4.5 in.
1,Cruel.,If you are honestly thinking of keeping any living creature in this-- perhaps you should not own a pet.This is a torture chamber.
3,AN OK FILM,"Not a bad entry into the soft core erotica listings. It has a plot and some acting that goes a step or two above the high school level. Shauna O'Brien does a decent job playing a stripper, although to my mind, her breasts have been surgically malformed through implants. Why do these women do this to themselves? It may be that producers force them to; surely the decision can't be voluntary."
3,"not bad, check it out","typical Shauna O'Brien movie..little bit of mystery, fair amount of sex, acting wasn't too bad, worthwhile if you are a fan, which is why I bought it"
5,Great tools home use,"I am a landlord and home repair ""do it yourself-er"". I bought my first Versa Pak drill around 10 years ago. Since then, I bought this combo pack, 2nd drill, detail sander, air pump, circular saw, screw driver, rotary tool, snake lighe and flashlight (I think that's it, but I might have missed one or two tools I have). I kept buying more tools because the power is sufficient for doing home projects, the reliability is solid, and the batteries last pretty long. My latest projects is building a 7 foot x 3 foot table and six benches, and building a dresser. I do have around 14 batteries, and usually use around 6 batteries during a 6 hour project.You could spend more, but for general home repair and improvement, this is a great kit. BTW, I also have a 14.4 drill that I never use because these have solid power and battery life."
3,Thou Shalt Not,"I honestly think that this score shows a lot of merit. ""Oh! Ain't that Sweet"" and ""Take Her Two the Mardi Gras"" are the very best from the score. However, this cast album of the show lacks a really good cast. The ensemble sounds like something along the lines of a chorus from The Carnival Cruise Line production of ""Hooray for Hollywood!"" The other performers aren't exceptional with the exception of Norbert Leo Butz who is in his element."
1,Bad bad and more bad,"First show on Broadway I ever left at intermission. I bought the tickets because I didn't think I could go wrong seeing a show directed by Strohman, starring Craig Bierko who was fantastic in Music Man and was flat flat flat in this show, and music by Harry Connick Jr. whom I have loved forever. It taught me that everything has it's place and Harry's place is not a Broadway stage. I hope for his sake, he does not try again. If I could rate something at zero stars, this would get that rating."
1,ICK!,I have to say that this is the worst show that I have ever seen performed on a stage! The music has no flow and certainly is not something to add to any collection! None of the songs flow. Most of them are cheesy. And that horrible tugboat song will haunt me in my dreams.
2,difficult to seed,"These seeds would probably be okay for a more experienced gardener. They did not sprout for me at all, probably because they had such a long germination time and required more care for that reason."
2,Great Show - poor editing ruins continuity.,"This is the 2nd live Smokey Robinson show now commercially available on DVD. The 1990 show from Atlantic City is classic Smokey, but is uneven due to poor editing which took out the patter and intros that set up the next song. Freeze frame transitions with dubbed in applause make you wonder what you missed. Examples: At one point his tie vanishes without a trace. Fortunately, it did not re-appear in a later track! A requested song ""Starting Here and Now"" jumps in without the request. These editing errors put a crimp in the enjoyment of what appears to have been a great show. Better than no video, but could have been a five star rating with proper editing, i.e. letting the show run like you were in the audience."
1,"Very strange, and hard to follow for beginers","I would like to know if there are any books that beside this book so that I can learn Illustrator. In particular, Using the Pen tool or other features. That's right, so I can learn and understand more about the topic and get well prepared for a career in design and graphics.I am wondering if this is possible, I'd like to learn about Illustrator ASAP.Thank you very much for your time and help.If you are reviewing other Illustrator books, please inform if they will be able to help. So far, this one and two others have been of no good to me."
1,Horrible,"This book, besides being terribly out of date, is filled with contrary advice and poor examples. The manual from Adobe is much more useful than this book. two thumbs down from this reviewer."
4,"Interesting book, needed it for a college class.","It is definitely a book that can be used to learn about ones ancestry past our general idea of generations. This explains how we came to be as modern humans. It goes through our relationships with apes and how genetically close we are to them. Detailed book on this subject, it goes along with the basis of biological anthropology. I am currently using this for a my race and racism class at my university."
3,Dated But Entertaining Fluff,"The title is all that remains of Gershwin's acidic musical anti-war satire, and Garland and Rooney are left to their own devices in this ""Let's Put On A Show!"" genre musical tailored to highlight their talents. Ironically, given the original play's premise, there is considerable flag-waving in this particular venture, with Garland and Rooney paying hommage to the good old USA in an unblushing effusion of sentimental patriotism. Even so, Garland and Rooney make an effective and extremely energetic team, particularly when dropped down into one of director Busby Berkley's famous production numbers, and Garland's developing talents remain astonishingly fresh even in this dated bit of fluff."
2,Not as Good as I had Hoped,"They use Pandora to sell this DVD but she is hardly on it. They foucus mainly on to lesser know ladies. They only tease you with several other ""Head Liners""."
3,Picture Light,Light is OK for what it was intended. Looks like a light for this money would have a better way of locking it down after it is set where you want it. It needs something better then the small knurled knob that is used to apply pressure on the extension rod to lock it. I had to drill a hole the size of the screw threads to keep it level. Even turning it on makes it turn on the rod.
4,Scat Singing Method purchased from Amazon.com,"I have enjoyed working with the Scat Singing Method. It is very analytical, and allows one to focus on one element of scatting at a time. The writer/teacher is a very good scatsinger. I suppose there were copyright issues - that's why he changed the title of some jazz standards and created tunes that suggested the standard. The knockoffs were a bit dorky, and I suppose I am to scatsing over the singers. I would recommend this book to anyone who does not have a real jam session near her or him to attend or who wants to think about scatsinging and approach it intelligently from within first before going out to bare his/her soul to the 'world.' Just don't forget to listen and transcribe / memorize if possible those professional scatters out there who learned from listening and doing (e.g. Ella Fitzgerald, Sarah Vaughn, Bobby McFerrin, Jon Hendricks, etc.). Thumbs up!"
4,A little above intermediate level,"Years ago, I lived in Mexico and Guatemela (for about 5 years). I developed my spoken spanish to a level of medium fluency ( I can communicate clearly what I intend to communicate and understand clearly a vast majority of what is communicated to me). About 2 months ago I bought Rosetta Stone Homeshool Levels 1-3. In 2 months, studying for about an hour a day; I have worked through every reading, writing and speaking exercise (as well as the companion audio) in Levels 1 & 2 and am currently on level 3. I sailed through these lessons rather easily.While the quality of the stories and the language presented is clear, I believe that this book is slightly on the advanced side. When I read it, I need a dictionary at my side. That being said - I bought it to learn - so my review is not a complaint rather is a clarification of the level."
1,Don't buy me,"This is a terrible purchase and Zenith knows it. I originally paid over a thousand for this TV. Within 3 months a purple haze formed in the background, back to the shop. Within the next three months the haze was back, apparently something was loose. Within the next six months the TV began to emit a squealing sound at random moments and it still does. I've told Zenith about it on three separate instances, all very early on within the customer experience. They say they're a six sigma company yet don't seem interested in the feedback? I had a Sony 27 never a problem with haze or sound. I'll never buy a Zenith again."
1,Needs lots of help!,"I decided to try the Zenith model when we replaced our Sony - not because it wasn't working fine, but because it could not handle our newer ""accessories."" I did not check this review site but saw this model in the store and liked the quality. This Zenith lasted six months and one day would not turn on. Was then in the shop for 3 months while they replaced the entire board. Now is back, but not the same. With an expensive antennae system, the TV cannot pick up local channels not offered through cable. The old Sony has no problem receiving them. ...local[store] has been horrible to deal with, the only thing that saved us was the corporate office after working hard to find someone there. The 1 star rating I found here is appropriate."
2,Way too much,"This is certainly and exaustive (and exausting) overview of the field of investigative reporting. It gets a bit tiresome, though, for reporters like myself who don't see the world in the same good journalists vs. bad everyone else way that Weinberg and the IRE croud does. Nevertheless, there are some good ideas that can add punch to a journalist's reporting skills. Not a bad choice if you've run out of better books to read on reporting."
3,Let down,"Other than the quick shipping I cannot recommend this item. It took me almost two hours to assemble the set since many of the components failed to lock and/or unlock smoothly. Having experience with this type of product, I would not expect such a long delay. The item is intended for travel, yeah right. A few of the directions were unclear. Additionally, the bassinet does not swing and the floor is not adjustable to different heights in this particular model--that was unclear in the description. Finally, what sense does it make to have the supply center attach at the opposite side of the crib as the changing table? I am seriously thinking of returning this product."
5,strong insights into avant garde art,"I was worried at first, the first few pages read like an episode of ""Lifestyles of the Rich And Famous"" in its juicy overview of late 19th century. But then he started talking about avant garde art, and it became an astute exploration of the reasons behind avant garde art, how it works, and why it is valid.I was looking for some info on Erik Satie and came away very satisfied."
1,"Upon rereading, I have serious doubts about this book","I read the Banquet Years about 20 years ago and for some reason picked it up again last week. In my recollection, it was astute, scholarly, and brilliant. What a shock to find a bunch of half-baked drivel. Shattuck may know his subject, but he comes across as a pretentious twit who gets no enjoyment from the arts. All these guys would have hated him--especially Alfred Jarry."
2,"Good, not great","This boat motor does the job, but takes forever to get it done. Its limited power of 200 watts is a severe hindrance. Merely pureeing carrots in chix stock (quart total volume) left quite a few chunks after nearly 30 seconds of blending. It is however, easy to clean and quieter than your average blender or food processor. Do yourself a favor and get the Braun 430, with 50% more power and only a minor price difference."
4,Chopper is a great addition .....,"The mixer of course is wonderful ... Braun makes a good durable product ... I love the chopper .. it's so convenient, esp. at Christmas with all the baking .. its so handy for chopping nuts or grating cheese"
3,New book about us chicks,"The chicks are back and as good as ever. If you liked the first three books in the series, you will like this one. Many of our favorites are back including the Ladies' arms and auxiliary, our contract fighter turned writer on Paper-Pushers. Additionally, there are many new contributors, including a very funny and true short poem to lead off the collection. And, don't miss the author's bios which are written in a style nearly as humorous as the stories."
5,Best guide for NYC,This travel guide helped me while visiting the most interesting places in NYC and optimized my vacations. The guides is updated and Michelin's stars systems is really reliable.
3,New American Bible review,The bible is indeed very very nice but the type is very very small which makes it difficult to read at times.
2,"Ship Stuff, Much?","It took them TWO WEEKS to ship this item! That's just ridiculous. I almost made the mistake of ordering fish food from them too, but my pet would've STARVED! Use Petsmart - I will next time for sure."
2,Not what I expected,"This item is tiny. I thought I was getting a much larger toy than this. The only dog that can play with this would be a toy breed because of the item's size. If you have a large dog like I do, don't buy this item. I'm going to either return it or give it to someone with a small dog, because I certainly can't give it to my dog."
5,real life more outlandish than fiction,If you were asked to make up a Grisham type tale about politics and corruption I do not think it would rival the true story this book takes you through.
4,Good But Not Great,"This figure is pretty cool...a decent likeness of my second favorite avenger. However, it is certainly not worth the current price on this site. Its facial sculpt is amazing, but the body joints suffer from occasionally looseness..as soon as you remove the cape, it never really comes back on.An incredible paint job and astounding articulatoion, but the figure appears to kind of hunch over and the ball-and-socket joints are a bit obvious. Everything I just said was from a collector's viewpoint. I'm sure a kid would enjoy this, after they got over the fact that he's not Iron Man or Thor. Overall, Vision is a cool figure who is not exactly worth the price."
1,Marvel Legends Vision,Poor figure. Not true to the comics: Too small & skinny compared to other Marvel Legends. Eyes look cock eyed. Has a hard time standing by itself.
2,Not the illuminating read I was looking for...,"While there were glimmers of useful, persuasive arguments hidden within a few pages of the book both for and against children, they were unfortunately lost amongst a blase collection of autobiographical tedium. I would say that most of the authors are not relate able - mothers who get pregnant by felons in jail, whom they met in jail, bi-polar depressives, 48 year old lesbian partners etc. The stories are, for the most part, well written, but offer very few actual reasons behind the decision to have children or remain childless. For the most part (i.e. over 90%) they are factual stories of how the author did or did not physically end up with children. I was looking for a book that would give some insight into this huge decision (which my wife and I are currently struggling with), and it definitely does not fit into this category. I feel like I wasted my time reading the book (and my $10!)."
2,To have and have not,"One of those unique books where professional writers openly discuss their personal decisions on family and children. Interesting take is that they have all made decision and stuck with it in regards to whether or not to have children. Neither one of them seems to regret their decision and is firmly behind it. While some writings are more impressive than others, they all have in common he fact that they are sincere and open."
1,Writing is far fetched/ unrelatable,"The writers here seem proud, smug, and so ""me"" oriented that I found them boring and unhappy. Regardless of their stance on child rearing, there seems an overwelming urge to be right rather than display any in-depth personal conversation. I was put off by some religious bashing... Is it necessary to reprimand Christians for wanting to reproduce? Do rich people make better parents? Should deciding to have a child be as simple as deciding where to go on your next vacation? Some of the authors seem to think so. I was impressed by a few of the entries... hence the 1 star."
4,Helpful and well-written perspectives,"It's a compilation of short stories, so you can read it in segments. I whipped through it in two days. Most of the stories are by writers, resulting in many very well-written accounts. I felt relief knowing I'm not the only one who - at 33 - thinks ""maybe not"". I enjoyed how the book covers the no's, the maybes, and the yes's to this choice."
2,Good only if you want kids,"Most of the childfree/childless people in this book claim that they may change their minds or regret not having kids. Only one really stood out and said no I am never having kids (Elinor Burkett) The ones who were on the fence really seemed like they will all have kids one day. And there are no I regret having kids stories from the parents.The book reads very fast and is an interesting read. But I would not add it to a list for those trying to chose if they should have kids or not. It leans too much towards being a parent. If you want honest anwsers from both the childfree and moms/parents I recommend ""do I want to be a mom?"" you can find it here on amazon."
3,"Some good writing. An interesting read, but not helpful for decision-making","I picked this book up second hand. It seemed like an interesting topic. I must say that many of the stories presented were interesting pieces of non-fiction. These well-written and personal tales were a quick read but I found it really hard to relate to most of the writers. Many seemed overly neurotic, some merely callous. I didn't find the book helpful enough that I would loan it to any friends who were deciding on whether or not to have children. There are a small handful of gems in the book. I would recommended it only as an interesting read for non-fiction short stories if you get can pick it up at the library."
4,The pro side does not paint a happy picture,"I bought this book because I'm on the fence and leaning towards no kids. Without friends and family with small children I wanted to read about how children could enrich your lives or things you might get out of having them so I liked the idea of a book that presented several angles on whether to take the plunge. On the whole, I found the pro side of the book very disheartening. Most of the writers seemed to talk about how hard things were, what an ordeal having children was, etc. There was very little joy and happiness represented. A fascinating read but not as balanced as I would have liked."
2,Xavi Shaw,"I did not found the book particularly interesting. Also, I think the average length of a part is not long enough for a average man(or woman)'s bowel movement reading."
4,Hardwood desk tray,"We had been searching for a affordable wood desk tray, found these on the internet. Was very pleased with the purchase. They were of good quality and served our needs. I would like to have seen them come with hardware to stack but the trays were great."
2,Poor Quality Control,"I gave this item 2 stars because of the poor quality control. I ordered two so I could stack them, the first one was fine. The second item was almost pink and the grain was terrible. I exchanged it for a third, which was just as poor quality as the second. I returned all of them. That's a 33% chance you will not get what you expect. I cannot recommend this product."
4,nokia n96 series,"I USED THIS PHONE IN THE PASSED AND WAS AMAZED OF THE PICTURES I SHOT WITH THE CAMERA.I LIKE THE NOKIA MENU , WHICH IS VERY EASY AND HAS EVERYTHING I NEED. THE ONLY HANDICAP IS THE BATTERY ,THAT NEEDS RECHARGING VERY OFTEN.....SO I SEARCHED AND FOUND IT AGAIN ON AMAZON. I BOUGHT IT AND I AM VERY SATISFIED WITH IT....."
5,J-Techno Excellence,"Great disk!For fans familiar with the breadth of Kotoko's music, the songs on this disk don't fall into her cute 'Denpa' recordings such as Short Circuit or her softer melodic work.As the title tracks for the Kannazuki no Miko anime, the songs on this disc are pure fast-paced, high-energy techno, and some of her best overall!Includes three original songs Re-sublimity, Agony, and Supperation-core, as well as karaoke versions of Re-sublimity & Agony."
5,great single,very good single agony i thought was such a great song if u like kotoko buy this im going to be buying all of her albumes becouse of this single
4,Differnet than Pogo Online Version,"This is different than the Online version of Word Whomp on Pogo.com. The little critters don't nod, bounce and grin when you get a right word, nor do they shake their heads when you miss, which is a huge part of the game's attraction. This boxed version is good, but the graphics are lacking. I actually found the boxed version rather boring because of the missing actions of the critters.It has three different game levels. It has a timed game as well as an game with no time limits.This does not play on Windows Vista. It won't even load properly. On Windows 2000 it worked perfectly.All in all it's a cute game suitable for any age."
4,Word Whomp Purchase,I recently got my mother hooked on Word Whomp and decided this is the perfect choice for a Christmas gift for her. The game has provided enjoyment for hours and will continue to do so now even when she is not connected to the internet. Perfect gift for those that love to spell and continue to learn or use new words!
3,Word Whomp Deluxe,"I downloaded this game from Pogo years ago but lost it when I got a new computer. Looked for quite awhile before I found one with a reasonable price. Shop around. I found them from $179.00 (yes, that's right) to $6.50. I'm very happy with this game from Amazon (played off a disc) but don't like the pop-up's that asks ""this wants to make a change to your computer hard drive. Do you want to allow it?"" Don't know if that is from the disc or a virus attracted by that disc. This is the only place I get this."
4,Traffic with Steve Marriott,Jim Capaldi great solo artist as drummer with Traffic and Steve Winwood. He did some really good stuff and this cd is great stuff with latter Steve Marriott vocals.
5,Historical allure that draws you in to the past,This book takes you back to a time when freedom was not an option for everyone. The story details pulls you into the time period and reflects on the reality of Southern Louisiana and it's brutal past.
4,Good History,"What can I say but wow. The Boys at FASA really when all out on this one. The history is quite intense. Not much good for the traditional Fire and Slag players who focus on the battles, but it is an excellent referance for any GM's who run the Mechwarrior Role playing game. The color artwork of the new clan's painting skeems and uniforms are excellent. A must have for any die hard Battletech collector."
5,The foundation of a whole shop!,"I live off grid, and have very restricted electric. As such, I have to find alternatives to power tools whenever possible. While I may choose to modify the design presented in this book to accomadate other tools, the basics are excellent and very usable. The book contains step by step instructions that are clear and very do-able provided you have basic metal working skills or know someone who has them. Very few parts are specific, so you can adapt to whatever you have laying around. Purely a how to instruction book for one specific tool, but once you know how to make things turn a clever person could turn this into a bandsaw, scrollsaw, sander, buffer, grinder, or any number of other devices. A very good book all in all."
3,Low Budget Horror,"There is something for every taste in this collection- groovy bi-sexual vampires, Italian style Hammer, a mummy alien and Linda Blair. None of them really a classic but if you like psychotronic cinema you will enjoy it."
5,Velvet Vampire is a real gem!,"The best movie is this grouping is The Velvet Vampire -- .a beautifully shot, erotic film that is well above the standard fare in the vampire genre! I enjoyed seeing Joseph Cotton in Lady Frankenstein."
1,Go to Ikea,"I purchased this bookcase based on many reviews. I'm sorry I have to disagree, but the assembly is a nightmare. The item is made from flimsy particleboard. There is really no stability to the unit. The connecting cam screws are made of plastic which actually cracked in two. I returned the item and purchased two similar cases from Ikea for about $10 more, however there is no comparison. The Ikea one is a solid unit."
3,Multi Media storage cabinets,"The storage units serve their purpose BUT for what we paid, the contruction isn't that good. we had to be real careful when we moved them they bowed in th middle. as long as they stay put they are ok and look nice."
1,A perfectly awful experience,This is cheap particle board wood--thin and brittle-- barely rugged enough to hold a large amount of DVD's. The assembly instructions are unclear and confusing and my attempt to assemble was a total disaster. I have complained to AMAZON and contacted the seller to return.
4,Great value for the capacity.,"This shelf is quite worth the price if you are looking for a high-volume storage solution on a budget. Don't expect the world's greatest shelving unit, and if you can afford a high-quality unit in the three to seven hundred dollar range, you should go with that. But if you are an individual who, such as myself, allocates most of your personal spending budget on multimedia, and need an affordable way to keep it all together, then do not hesitate on the Oskar shelf. I've owned one for my CDs for nearly a year now, and it's been such a useful setup that I recently purchased a second Oskar unit for my DVDs, as they've outgrown my older case."
5,Excellent purchase,This is a great product. I was very pleased with the purchase. It suited my needs just right. It takes up less room with more storage than the last shelf I had in the same place.RichardUSA
1,Cheap and flimsy,I read the other reviews on this product and was surprised how flimsy it was. The particle board is thinner then other bookcases I have purchased. The four vertical boards only run 1/2 the height requiring you to fasten them to the middle shelf from each side. The mechanism to lock them together pulled out of the middle shelf when moving it around making the bookcase unusable. It is a design problem with the bookcase and was not a manufacturing flaw. Look elsewhere!
5,Mr. Organized,"This storage cabinet arrived well-packed in a heavy box. It went together in 15 minutes quite easily. Since the base extends out further than the rest, I would suggest laying the unit flat across a workbench or table with the lip hanging over so you can easily nail the 2 backing pieces on. Started with 2 and am sure I'll be adding more."
1,Cheap and flimsy,"We bought two. Took the first one out and put it together, only to have it break in two upon standing it up. They should have used screws or nails or something to keep the two portions secured in the middle."
4,Great storage unit.,Nothing special but does its job and is rather nice looking. Very easy to set up took about a hour with ease.
3,Not the Bluesway Blues On Top Of Blues,"The cd being sold on this page is not the Bluesway album ""Blues On Top of Blues""; it is a compilation of B.B. King tracks from his Kent years. They're all great, but the reviews included here are mostly about the Bluesway album of the same title."
5,The Fall of the House of Usher,"Epstein's sterling adaptation of the well-known Poe story today remains one of the most haunting and visually adventurous horror movies of the silent era. Certainly, the film's expressionistic use of slow-motion techniques and eerie settings owes a lot to the presence of surrealist Luis Buñuel, who served as assistant director. Gance (wife of French director Abel) is radiant, too, even as a shrouded specter. With its lurid, foggy air of mystery and demented otherworldliness, ""Usher"" is a triumph of the gothic sensibility."
3,Shadows perform shadows,"An 1929th year story of a wife visiting her husband after her death and his friend involved is performed brilliantly.Eventually, a silent cinematograph demanded even more artistic skills than recent produces animated.Also staged brilliantly, it is simply boring to watch this stuff today."
5,Best Classic Poe Tale Ever!!!!!!!!!!,This one is really cool I mean I read alot of Stories by Edgar Allan Poe Because I am a big fan of Poe and even though I would say that The Fall of the House of Usher was one of my Favorite Stories of all time and I really like this movie. And it really has beautiful Music to this and This one is very silent but you may have heard that this is what Movies where like back in the 1920's!
4,Beautiful film; really bad music!,"This is an absolutely fantastic spooky film which draws you in. The DVD presentation is very good, with an excellent print and excellent picture quality. The only drawback is that this is a French film and some stupid guy guy has to read all the titles and lines, and you can barely understand what he's saying through his strong French accent. The other thing about the soundtrack is the music. It's a cross between Irish folk music and church music. When I started this DVD I tried to turn off the sound, but then realized that there were no subtitles, so I was forced to listen to the bad music and that old French wretch throughout the film, but it's not TOO distracting. The audio is the only reason I didn't give this DVD 5 stars, and though I do prefer the 1949 version of this title this one has mesmerising cinematography and is really good for a silent film."
2,General Observation,This one was a gift I'm hoping that the recipient enjoyed it. I didn't think much of it when I saw it.
2,ALMOST UNWATCHABLE,"looked like some people got together after drinking all weekend and decided to 'make a movie'. it just looks [poorly made], and the music just doesn't do anything to conjure any mood other than dry boredom."
3,Weighing the evidence--Reader's Digest version,"I was disappointed that the Student Edition didn't address the evidence for the reality of Christ in the same order as the original book (The Case for Christ, by Lee Strobel). I would have liked to use them together in my study group. The Student Edition does have some things in tables and charts that may make the information easier to grasp. The Student Edition was short on information about the reliability of the Bible, which is an area in which the kids I'm working with need more help."
4,Excellent resource for my 8th grade students,"This has been a good book for my 7th and 8th grade Bible class. I would have liked a few more facts about the reliability of Scripture, as in the Case for Christmas and The Case for Christ, but overall, it has been good for my students at our Christian School to think about why they believe what they believe. :)"
4,Fun!,"Really cool collectors item. Has nice big pages to put clippings, concert pics, and other stuff you'd like to remember about your favorite Kids."
5,Excellent!,"Sharon, you did an excellent job with these short stories. My favorite was ""Hunting for Boys."" This book is all about girls and they boys they like. It's about learning about relationships. It demonstrates puberty and hormones kicking in. It reminds me of the saying by Dolly Parton on confusion: ""they don't know whether to scratch their watch or wind their behind."" Moms and Dads, please get this book for your daughters. They will enjoy the stories and may even find themselves in some of them. Each story has a different premise but they all tie into the same plot--getting with a boy. It reminds me when I first started liking boys when I was in junior high. I definitely recommend this book for the average teenager. Well done, Sharon, and keep 'em coming."
5,A Student Favorite,"I have bought several copies of this book. My middle school and high school students like Ms Flake's novels, and I usually don't get them back. I liked the variety of relationships about which Ms Flake has written. My guess is that some of my students can find parts of their lives in these characters."
4,okay,"i thought this was an alright book. It took me a while to read it b/c i didnt like all the stories. Once i got really into one, it was over. I liked this book but i dont think it was one of the best i ever read."
2,THIS BOOK WAS SUGER COATED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,THAT IS NOT HOW IT GOES DOWN IN REAL LIFE!!!!!!!!! THE ONLY REASON I GAVE IT A 2 IS BECAUSE I ENJOYED THE FAT GIRL IN THAT WAS IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!IF YOU WANT A STORY ABOUT REAL LIFE PICK UP THE COLDEST WINTER EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!
2,Dont always go by reviews!!,This book received excellent reviews from other readers and so I ordered it. I was very disappointed when it arrived as this is very much a beginners cookbook which is probably fine for newly marrieds. There are no new exciting recpies - most of them rehashed old ones we are all surely bored of by now...... Secondly this book was obviously written for the UK market ( I come from there! ) as it talks about several ingredients that you either just cant buy here or you have to special order them. Also anyone who has ever eaten precooked vacum packed new potatoes know how truly disgusting they are to anyone one who has even the slightest discerning palate. This book belongs in one of those close out book stores - not Amazon!
3,An attack on Arnold Schwarznegger???,Haven't read this one yet - I'll give it 3 stars for marketing apeal. Just wondering if this is a hit piece on the Hollywood action hero presently making a bid to take over the Governor's mansion in California with less than a third of the voters supporting him and absolutely no chance at a majority.
1,Ingraham Venom,"Laura comes across as an intelligent radio host with a talent for acerbic wit. Sadly, her book is about as biased as she claims the media to be. I expected this book to be smart and edgy, but aborted my attempt to read it halfway through. Such unsubstantiated drivel is not worth paying for!It is quite clear that Laura is a person filled with insular hatred, a characteristic of many neo-cons in her generation. Her ideas are clear but her reasoning is not, which is a major problem for a reader that is looking for objectivity.Laura should simply shut up and practise law!"
2,How original !,"Just what this country needs now: another right wing whiner blaming everyone and everything else for things that don't go their way. Ingram often talks about 'they' in this book as some sort of ominpotent force. I suppose as a democrat, I am part of 'they' but my Christian faith is clearly an element of religous thought Ingram has never been exposed to. Before she starts ranting about same, she may be well served to read a bit more about Dorothy Day, Thomas Merton and other Christian thinkers who Ingram would likely dismiss in about 10 seconds with a tirade of childish insults.Please let me know when the grown ups get back into publishing books. Its not the right wing I am against ( Buckley, Will and others do their cause well) , rather its sophomoric talk radio personalites scribbling out book after book , like 'Shut up and Sing' preaching to the already converted, and offer nothing new."
2,The Elite Giving Advice About the Elite,"I don't take political, religious & personal advice from what Laura Ingraham defines as ""Elites"" but on the other hand I don't take advice from radio personalities either. She's every bit as much an entertainer as anyone else in the media. It's pretty much a case of an elephant telling a donkey he's got big ears & vice-versa."
3,Ugh. I wanted to be entertained.,"Here's the question. How can Laura Ingraham be so funny on the radio and so tedious in print?Is it that the book was written in 2003 and its premise has become basic common knowledge? In other words, maybe the material is stale in 2012?Is it because I'm so unplugged from the world of American entertainment, so I not only don't care about the elites, I rarely even recognize their names and faces? Yes, probably. Part of that is my problem as the reader.I was still hoping this book would be a great tool for MOCKING entertainment personalities for their incoherent political pronouncements ... instead it just catalogued their statements. Yawn.More mockery of the Left, please."
4,This book hits the liberal right where it hurts..,This is a very good book...I recently saw Bruce Springsteen..I love his music by they way..And Felt the same way as she wrote her title to this book...Just shut up and sing..I don't go to hear your left wing views I came to have a great time escape all the politics for the day...What was a great show was brought down to a bummer by Bruce Springsteen and his anti Bush ramblings..He actually tells us to go by Al Frankins Book.. Are you kidding me? Hollywood and most rock music stars today are out of touch with reality with middle America..What will it take for these leftist socalist leaning anti Americans to see reality? Another 9-11? I pray not..
4,Don't miss the point,"Please don't miss the point of this book, as all the reactionary reviews posted so far seem to have done. Some people sing, or they act, or they throw a ball. That's all. No one is saying that celebrities shouldn't have a voice, just like everyone else. What is being asked is a very basic question. Why, in America, are celebrities given such attention in public matters? You sing? That's nice, but why should I then particularly care what your political views are? No one wants to censor celebrities, but isn't it just a little silly to think that because someone sings or acts that they have some special understanding of the environment or politics?"
5,Finally - someone lets leftywood have it.,"An awesome book. No, Laura is not an investigative reporter, but she articulates well the views of many of us in middle america rather nicely. Ie, that Hollywood and many universities in the US are no longer moderate on the issues and willing to openly debate substance but have instead become bastions of speech codes where 98% or more of the faculty are far-left liberal and won't tolerate free speech of those with contrary opinions. Thankfully she has finally taken them on."
4,How to know you've hit your target,You know what you're getting when you read anything by Laura Ingraham. It should come as no surprise.You know she succeded by reading the reactions. She's funny and sharp regardless of your political leanings. Conservatives will appreciate the logic and humor; Lefties will squirm and lash out with semiliterate rants.Bullseye.
5,This book rocks!,"This book rocks! The people who gave it one star probably haven't read it and are personally attacking Laura because of her political views. I wish some of my brainwashed liberal friends would at leased read the back cover of Shut Up and Sing, but they will probably be more interested in that idiot Al Franken's book. Laura Ingraham is one of the best radio talk show hosts in America today. People who disagree with my statement probably don't listen to talk radio, are crybaby liberals, or are sexist males who feel that a woman's place is in the home.Evan BowenAlbany, NY"
1,Maybe it's just a bad book?,"Perhaps the fact that the book is so hard to find at the evil, ""liberal"" book stores (as she constantly whines about on her show)has more to do with the quality of the book than the imagined political bias of the booksellers.Remainder racks here we come!"
1,Shut Up And Goosestep!,"Yes, Laura, shut up. Once and for all. And by the way, your roots are showing.What an awful, shrill book. It has some entertainment value to be sure. But it is so whiney, so preachy, so painfully and utterly shrill. The author is just another rich, spoiled brat looking down her pointy little nose at the rest of us common folk.Sorry, Laura, we all have a right to free speech in the USA. So none of us have to shut up if we dang well don't want to. In her fascist uber-right wing world we would have no freedom of speech, and no one would be allowed to disagree with her wet dream rightist government. But that's not the way the world is. In this book the author puts down all the so-called elites. When the author is the biggest elitist of the bunch! Avoid this book. Root canal is more fun."
1,"Boring, predictable, right-wing hate/spin","I thought her ""talk show"" was bad, but this book puts the shrill voice on the radio to shame.Remember what Monica did to Bill in the White House? Well this is the book version of the same sex act performed by Laura on GW Bush. Apparently, she has no shame.I wouldn't use this book (...), much less recommend it as something useful to read."
1,Utter garbage,"Laura Ingraham is such a clumsy, awful writer she actually makes Ann Coulter look coherent. And just like Coulter, Ingraham's right wing allies are buying this one in bulk to artificially push it up the charts (see the ""dagger"" on the NYT list). In reality it probably hasn't sold 10 honest copies.Pure right wing dreck. Even if you're a republican, you shouldn't waste your money on this book. There's nothing new here in the way of opinions, just more screeching to the choir. Save your money."
1,Another Right winger Cry Baby,Why these conservatives are acting like cry babies?Shut Up and dance baby!
1,Typical rightwing claptrap,"This book is worthless. Laura Ingraham -- herself an elite Washington, DC attorney -- takes it upon herself to determine who does and does not have the right to express a political opinion. Who died and appointed her God? Laura Ingraham needs to take her own advice, to wit: Shut up and write someone's will."
1,Everyone who disagrees must be an America-hating liberal.,"Gross simplifications, and cheap pandering to the most extreme views of her party (much like Michael Moore for the far left, whom I also despise), makes for some boring fodder from another bleached-blond ""pundit"".Childish sniping by the likes of Ingraham & Moore only serve to antagonize the vast majority of Americans who are centrists and who have a little common sense. I'm not sure how stupid you have to be to buy this line of argument: if you think SUVs unnecessarily waste gas, then you're an America-hating liberal, and if you don't approve of George Bush's handling of our country, you must be an al Qaeda-loving terrorist.Let's hope that the majority of reasonable-minded people can look past the divisiveness of today's politics and relegate people like Laura Ingaham's junk to the garbage can."
1,Shut Up and Lift Weights,"After reading this piece of drivel, which I did at my brother's insistence, I anxiously await her book, ""Shut up and Lift Weights""...her expose' on Ahhnuld. Oh, that's right...he's a Republican, so we're not likely to see that book. It's only the Liberals she wants to shut up. That's democracy in action, Laura. You go girl! Go elsewhere that is."
3,Good but........,"I would probably be considered a social conservative and a political liberal. Use that as you will, but, after reading this book i actually found myself agreeing with Ms. Coulter on some aspects. Especially on the "" hollywood elites"" who do seem to theink that we are stupid and they are on some higher plain of existence that we cannot understand.Her critisims on Madonna and the Garlofalos of the world do make one think about the hollywood elites.The biggest problem was her attempt to make herself out to be a defender of the Christian community by spouting off bible versus. I am sure that she is not a religious conservative by any stretch. She is obviously more of an economic woman than anything else.She also needs to realize that critisisms of Mr. Bush does not make one unpatriotic or unsupportive of the actions of our military. I was really hoping for more of a balanced view and I feel it was lacking."
3,How many reviewers actually read this book?,I suspect that many people who left 1 star reviews and trashed the author have not read one page of this book.
1,Oh come on,"Oh come on Laura. It cannot be that everyone is out to get me. I cannot believe that Hollywood, the UN, Moore and as well as my alma mater are plotting against me, attempting to steal my free will. Sure, some people out there (maybe even Moore) want us all the see everything their way. But everyone? Nahhh.Before you read this, call your doctor and order the anxiety medication. If you buy into all her theories, you will need it."
2,Tedious,"I am a moderate conservative, so I have a lot of common political and ideological background with Laura Ingraham. I was ready to enjoy this book, and it never happened. For one thing, its title deceived me; I thought this would be much more about how political celebrities have become. She spends a little time on that, but this is really an ""everything"" book for her--her manifesto, basically. For another, the tone--a sort of civilized ""pissed off""--becomes tedious quickly, and she's not dexterous enough with the language to overcome it with clever word and phrase choice, as Ann Coulter can.I agreed with a lot of it, but what have I added to my mental inventory after nodding for four hours?Laura is wittier than this book reflects. Here's hoping her next effort is better."
5,The liberals all hate this book,"They don't want the truths in this book to get out. So, you just have to read it. Decide for yourself, don't let the whiny liberals tell you what to think!"
1,The New Newspeak,"This is a great book for anyone who believes ""elite"" is a good word choice for describing the creative talent behind the Simpsons, and a poor word choice for describing Enron executives. In other words, it's a great book for anyone who thinks up is actually down, or blue is actually yellow."
5,"Fun, Facts, and A Good Read. Buy it, you'll like it.","Laura maintains a cheerful perspective when discussing serious issues. I liked her truth-telling about the immigaration scandal.She exposed a list of ""lefty"" pro-ILLEGAL immigrant groups by name, and she doesn't spare the Republicans either. Laura was just as hard on President Bush and Karl Rove as on Clinton, only the President had the good sense to take advice from Laura Ingraham and cancel his amnesty plan for illegals. Thank you, Laura.That success was priceless! A joy to read"
5,Brilliant!,"This book is simply brilliant! Laura correctly points out that time after time, liberals are getting their brains beat in at the polls. Their only recourse has been to use and abuse the liberal courts of this country in a desperate attempt to maintain power. Face it, liberals. Conservatives are in the majority in this country and the trend will only continue!"
1,Worse than terrible!,This book is beyond bad! It could not hold my interest at all. It was just a bunch of rambling about stuff that no one cares about. I really think this could possibly be the worst book of the year! PLAIN TERRIBLE!
1,I don't understand...,"Since when does educating yourself, caring about others less fortunate than yourself, questioning the motives of your government, feeling that your faith is a private issue so you don't ""recruit"" for your religion, watching PBS instead of FoxNews, and listening to NPR rather than Rush make you ELITE?"
2,Pandering to current popular sentiments,"The cornerstone of America is the freedom to dissent. In seeking to supress that freedom, what America is the republican right attempting to erect. One that is more closer to the medieval islamic caliphate in principle (though spruced up by the 21st century technology) than to the one envisaged by the visionary founding fathers of this great country.Authors like this are just trying to sell books by spouting the right wing agenda and mudslinging free thinking Americans by stereotyping all as psedo-intellectual un-patriotic elitists.I agree there are equally crass liberal authors. I guess you need such pom-pom girls to counteract the sob-sisters."
4,A Nation Divided,"Man, it's been over 140 years since our nation has been this divided. Check out the reviews of this book... mostly 1 star, nasty, personal-attack ratings or five star, praises; not much in between. I for one enjoyed the book. It was an easy read, with alot to say. Did I agree with everything? No. But I did walk away entertained and enthusiastic... to read books by the ""other side"" (like Franken), and pay more attention to the news and politics. I do beleive the lines are being drawn very clearly in this nation. The blue vs. red states, the right vs. left, elites vs. average Joe's, whatever you call them. This is a cultural war, with extremism on both ends. Keep up the good work, Laura!"
1,Typical one-sided convervative hypocrisy.,"Why is is right-wingers are so quick to ridicule (i.e. silence) Hollywood ""libruls"" they dislike, yet cheer the political activism of the likes of Arnold Schwarzenegger and Charlton Heston? If Dennis Miller runs for California Senate on the GOP ticket will Ingraham tell him to shut up too? Or will he be a beknighted ""outsider"" with the right stuff to beat the crap out of Barbara Streisand...I mean Boxer."
1,Dangeris!,"Aw, I dunno wat you've got against all the luvly acters! I also finished skool in the aidth grade. I'm very greatful that their's acters out their hoo ken tell me wat to think, since ive never been to yooniver city and dunno how too think fer myself.I luv piece! I hate wore! Wie are their bad peeeple in the werld hoo like too sea peeeple get killed? Wie are their bad peeeple in the werld hoo don lik other peeeple hoo are difrent than them?

This buk is dangeris beekuz it is meen to al the luvly gud acters hoo are nice gud peeeple."
1,Don't waste your money!!!,"This book is a waste of time. It has no real substance. She constantly contradicts herself, and drones on and on about nothing."
2,Shut Up and Think,"Wow. The title is so offensive I just had to write the review. I did read the book, and while it presents compelling internal logic, I think it has a slight problem. Internal logic doesn't need to consider external reality. That is why people claim that they can prove the ""international Jewry"" run the media. A logic that does not take into acount the external is fiction, because it doesn't look at what is real. This sort of book I will call ""current event historial fiction."" For instance: Despite what this book implies, the wealthy should probably have more of their income taxed than the poor. Say you make $2.5 milion a year. Given a 25% tax, you pocket $1,875,000 a year. If you make $25,000 a year, you pocket $18,750. Yet the poor get taxed more than the rich because the rich supposedly earned all of their money, whereas poor and undereducated minority workers are lazy. I hate books that say that sort of thing."
1,cult member of psuedo-patiot conservtive fasctist bimbos,"this is a woman that says that bill mahr is a traitor pointing out the truth to america. two mocking that old time reporter for asking tough questions of president select bush. willing to let propaganda spewing out the news network is right. conservatives are even worse liberals dictionary defination of liberal is broad minded and tolerant.conservatives are greedy,inhuman,war mongers who use fear as cover to doing inhuman acts,are more anti-christian than the anti-christians. say unto thee if you buy this book you are non compos mentis. let true freedom ring"
1,Shut Up!,"Yes, in the immortal words of that great thinker, Bill O'Reilly: ""Shut up, just SHUT UP."" Hasn't the right wing brought political discourse to a new plane? Believe it or not, I am beginning to agree with O'Reilly."
2,Liberal celebrities are bad,How many books will be put out with this message. Is that the only thing that conservatives think about? Why dont we ever heard about how Arnold should shut up and stay out of politics?
3,Typical Neocon Rantings,"Laura Ingraham is hysterical, the best comedic writer I've come across in years. This neocon nut job thinks liberals are ""un-American"" and that those who are not Baptist bible thumpers are ""morally bankrupt"". I could go into which ideology our Founding Fathers favored- conservative or liberal- but I'll just say this: if you think questioning political leaders, as our Founders did, is ""un-American"", or that protesting WAR is anything but Christlike, you'll probably love this book and reference it many times in debates with those of us with sense. But for those of us who prefer rational arguments to calling someone with whom we disagree ""un-patriotic"", we'll stick with authors who aren't headed for the loony bin."
3,Entertaining but often off-key and wandering,"The entertainment elite, who apparently Laura thinks include no Conservatives or Republicans, are responsible for the title of this book, though the work covers alot of ground and in a not uncompelling way. Her writing style is warm and engaging just like her radio and TV personae.I'm sure that many Left-leaners, left-of-center Democrats, left-over socialists-who-don't-realize-they're-really-communists, etc., are also uncomfortable (maybe not embarrassed) by the speechifying of out-of-their-element talents like Sean Penn, Barbara Streisand, George Clooney, Rosie O'Donnell, et. al., so this facet of Shut Up And Sing could have made an interesting and very *entertaining* much smaller (in scope) book for the ""Humor"" section, not ""Current Affairs/Events"", etc."
4,"The Truth Hurts, The 'elites' are not elite!","Political commentator and radio talk-show host Laura Ingraham decries self-styled ""elite"" groups who believe themselves superior to those with traditional American values. She singles out mainstream media, academic intellectuals, and showbiz celebrities as well as the United Nations and antireligious and pro-immigration supporters. This is an interesting book and an easy read."
4,Shut Up & Sing,"If you're as tired as I am being preached to by a bunch of entertainment no-nothings, this is a read for you."
3,Selective listening,"The book is entertaining, take it for what it is. I happen to be right-wing conservative at heart, so there's no point of me re-emphasizing what Ingraham's already said. So where my view differs from Ingraham's that I don't understand why conservatives/rational people even pay attention to these entertainment idiots. Let 'em yap all they want. They are simply starved for attention and will say or do anything to get it. The more we get angry or worked up over it, the more kerosene goes on their fire. Remember that little brother or sister that used to pester you? Same goes here -- ignore them and they'll likely go away.For you liberal crybabies who can't stand the Ingrahams, Hannitys, O'Reillys, and Coulters -- ignore them, too. Then you can go back to believing that Michael Moore and Al Franken are actually talented."
1,"Shrill, Tyrannical and Uninformed","This book is little more than a poorly written (or ghosted) tirade that hurls page-after-page of bile at those with whom Ingraham disagrees. Although she tries hard to wrap herself in the flag, her ""patriotism"" simply serves as a fig leaf for a fascistic program. The list of good people and worthwhile causes that she hates is long indeed."
1,MORE LIES,"Another whiney contribution from the inarticulate right wing.No facts, please, just opinion.Know and understand, everything decent and good, that this country stands for has sprung out of the liberal political ethos. Universal suffrage, human rights, civil rights, and that most liberal idea of all, public education.NOT IN MY NAME MS. INGRAHAM!!"
1,I'm going to write a book......,"....and call it SHUT UP AND PUMP IRON!!The difference is, I won't expect to be taken seriously....."
1,Total waste of time,"I work in a large bookstore and we do not hide book that we don't agree with. Books are mapped out for display according to expected or actual sales. I had to read this book after some customers talked about conspiracy theories. This book is pure propaganda and it's a shame people believe this crap. I fear that american freedom is doomed if these kind of attitudes become mainstream, uhg!!"
1,"Blah, Blah, Blah",I think Ms. Ingraham had more credibility when she used to suck up to Imus to get a few minutes of air time at six o'clock in the morning.
4,Shut up and leave us alone,"What a great book and a call to action by those conerned about the elites trying to take over the country from average Americans. Ingraham carefully details who elites are and what their goals for a ""post-modern America"" are. I strongly recommend it to anyone concerned about the direction of this country."
4,Read Michael Moore and Shutup!,"It's obvious that most of the ""reviewers"" have not read the book. They're merely taking the opportunity to bash a conservative host. Pathetic."
3,Coherent conversation,"As an independent-minded person (read: not democrat or republican), I find Laura Ingram's books MUCH more readable than Coulter's. Laura, makes sense and it's not just Coulter-style vile ranting. She has some points of import. However, I disagree to some of them. People around here should stop giving good or bad reviews to books based on the person who wrote the book. Yes, I understand we're in a very politically-charged, politically-divided time in our country, but what's the point of giving a 1 star rating for a nice book (or giving 5 stars for a mediocre book) just because you like/dislike the person who wrote it and the opinions given? It still baffles me the level of inmaturity of some.Back to the book, If you have ever listened to Laura on the radio you know she holds no prisoners and her arguments are based on documented facts (unlike Coulter). Good Book, but I wish she would have spent more time in the substance of politics rather than those Holywood know-nothing."
2,"overly simplistic, little truth to any of her arguments","I usually reserve one star for the absolute worst so I give her two stars. Problems we have in this country is much more complicated than Ingraham thinks. Our society is a tapestry of many threads interwoven into each other. Dishonesty and corruption in politics are well known. But there are some who, with enough consciounce, fight for the people also. The bigger problem is with the mass, general public, who keeps pointing fingers but stay ignorant of many pressing issues. I think that ignorance comes more from indifference than stupidity. If people *really* cared about these issues, they will find out who is lying and who is not. UN is not perfect as no political system is perfect. But if I had to choose between the two, I would take UN consensus over unilateral arrogance any day."
5,To Mr. Mark Buckley,"First.. did you actually read the book? No?.. I didnt think so. Second, get a life. Bush won the election... and he won it almost three years ago. Move on."
1,Don't think to good???,Don't think to good??? Don't think to much!! Sit right down and eat your white bread! Another idiot from the right. Sorry Laura I did finish college. The Germans were much better at this!
1,This book is nothing but hate and lies.,"Thats all you need to know. This person is clearly brainwashed. She conflates criticism into anti-americanism and wants nothing more than a muzzle on any celebrity who does not agree with her. I can refute the entire premise of her book with one argument. She wants actors, singers, etc to stay out of politics. Actors and singers are artists. Artists create Art. Art reflects life. Actors and singers by acting and singing are commenting on life. If they decide to clarify thier positions outside of their songs or movies they are fulfilling thier function as commentators on life. Furthermore, Politics is an integral part of Life, especially in this day and age. Basically this author wants artists to fail in thier essential function, that of the morality of society. There is a flaw in all this of course, our actors and singers are so horribly untalented they hardly live up to this lofty standard I have applied to them, but at least they are trying."
5,An astounding must-read!,"Thank you Laura, for once again shining like a beacon in the dark world of elitism. Whether I am listening to you speak, or reading your written words, I am forever enlightened by your dead-on portraits of ""what's wrong in America"", and of those who are the very picture of cynisism and negativity. This book says it all-and more about those individuals who spew of hatred and anti-patriotism for our own lovely country. Thank you for naming many, and I agree on all counts, but they are only a handful in the vast pool of degenerates. You would really have to write a novel to include all of the Hollywood examples who like to think they are like-minded with the most ""politically correct"" in politics. It is insulting and an embarrassment to themselves to even try to step up to the plate on the issues they do. It is refreshing to read something from someone who truly IS an American, and has the wit and wisdom to put these idiots to shame. Great insight!"
1,very sad indeed,This book is a perfect example of how the extreme right winged religious bigots want to destroy anyone who does not agree with them. Hitler had lots of religious backing and he based his hatred of the Jews on the writings of the great reformer Martin Luther. I wonder if Laura would help burn movies and books written by liberals? Based on this book liberals could be sent to the gas chambers any day. If I was a delusional bigoted christian I would love this book.John
1,"Ah, More Republican Porn From Yet Another Neo-Con","The description of this book reads like a work of fiction. (""Meet The Elites..."") and its fitting because LI like FOX news, Coulter, Hannity, OReilly, and all the rest, has managed to create a world of fiction where ""THE LIBERAL AGENDA"" is being foisted on poor, freedom loving Americans every time they turn around. It is a seductive and EXTREMELY profitable fantasy world that's been constructive. But it's all fantasy. And they know it. But there's so much cash to be hoisted from the pockets of the god-fearing ""Middle Americans"" who buy into this stuff that they'll probably never stop churning these books off the assembly line. By the way Laura I've got news for you. Martin Sheen spent over a year in Southeast Asia. Ok, it was while filming Apocalypse Now, but that's still a year more than draft dodgers Bush or Cheney ever spent there."
1,"Read it, am ashamed of it","Hmmm. Expecting to gain some insight on the influence the wrong people have on our political process, I endured only the first 80 pages of this rant. Contrary to many Dems who will diss this book without reading a page, I am a dyed-in-the-wool conservative. But even I found the general tone of this book to be so extreme and unsupported that I wanted to defend liberalism! You know the t-shirt that says, ""The more people I meet, the more I like dogs""? I'm worried that one will come out that says, ""The more Ingraham I read, the more I like liberals."" In the words of O'Reilly recently to Franken, ""Shut up, shut up, shut up!"" And please don't sing either."
1,"Another dumb, conservative, loudmouth blonde","Loved the appearance of another dumb, conservative, loudmouth blonde on Hannity and Colmes today promoting this crap. Does this one come from the same box set as Ann Coulter? To paraphrase the title of her book Laura Ingraham needs to ""Shut up and listen!"" Does the absolute inability to listen to the opposing point of view run in conservative circles? Sean Hannity, Rush Limbaugh, Bill O'Reilly, Ann Coulter, now another one - Laura Ingraham... I can go on. While Alan Colmes was trying to make his point Ms. Ingraham would not shut up for a moment, instead preferring to drown him out with shouts and bobbling her head like a dashboard doll. No wonder Sean likes her so much!On another note, of course Sean and Laura would have a problem with the so called intellectual elite. Their behavior and way of arguing constantly reminds us that they're not part of it. They are far more arrogant and elitist in their views while being far less intellectual."
1,I'd give it less if I could,"What a waste of paper. I'm all open to listening to peoples ideas and new ways of thinking, but Ms. Ingraham just goes on rants and rants that make UFO theories look plausible. Ultimately, what it boils down to is ONE person's opinion throughout this entire read.Her writing style isn't bad, and while her ""facts"" seem more like guesses and high horse preaching, some of them are interesting to say the least. But really, what it comes down to is that they aren't facts at all, they are just opinions. Interesting opinions, but opinions nonetheless.It seems more like propoganda than a read ""hard hitting"" book."
1,Look to theyself,"I find it very strange that Ms. Ingraham assails people for voicing political opinions when she herself has no practical political expereince. She began her career on Rush which, contrary to his own opinion, is just a radio show. Although I am sure that she is very well informed about the events of the time her law degree gives her no more credibility than many of the people she rails against. Ms. Ingraham, one of the beautiful things about this great nation of ours is that noone has the right to tell anyone to just Shut Up. We all have a right to voice our opinions as loud and as long as our bankbooks will allow."
1,Anybody home?,"The sample pages alone contain contradictory ideas that reflect the author's confused thought process. Susan Sarandon elite but Schwarzenegger not? Does being non-elite involve lower intelligence? Jumbled speech pattern? Incoherent thoughts and and ideas? If so, then Ms. Ingraham definitely belongs in this latter bucket. What a muddled mind and screwy belief system."
2,Could have been more interesting,"I wish this book was more (or even entirely) about what Ingraham calls the ""business elites."" A culture that allows greed to go unchecked is one where morality doesn't really play a part -- if you're just living for increased profits, right and wrong take on totally different meanings. Too much of this book is wasted on making entertainers look silly. Making the odd comment about an actor's hazy values is humorous for a while, I guess. But after a while it just seems so useless -- like blaming Ronald McDonald when you get a bad hamburger (as a great comedian once said)."
1,Not as good as Coulter,"If you want your facism served up without any holds barred, I suggest you veer right towards Ann Coulter. If you want the theory, try Goebbels. If you want thin, syrupy SNAP TOO ATTENTION so-called patriotism, try Hannity. If you want irritable middle-class I-hate-anybody-who-doesn't-look-like-me irritability, try O'Reilly. Ingraham is just a pale imitation of these better leftist bashers. ....Oh...and if you want some cogent analysis of anything at all, are you ever in the wrong place."
1,"Ah, Another Cookie-Cutter Liberal Bashing Book...","The description of this book reads like a work of fiction. (""Meet The Elites..."") and its fitting because Ingraham like FOX news, Coulter, Hannity, OReilly, and all the rest, has managed to create a world of fiction where ""THE LIBERAL AGENDA"" is being foisted on poor, freedom loving Americans every time they turn around. It is a seductive and EXTREMELY profitable fantasy world that's been constructed. But it's all fantasy. And they know it. But there's so much cash to be hoisted from the pockets of the god-fearing ""Middle Americans"" who buy into this stuff that they'll probably never stop churning these books off the assembly line. By the way Laura I've got news for you. Martin Sheen spent FIVE YEARS in Southeast Asia. Ok, it was while filming Apocalypse Now, but that's still five years more than draft dodgers Bush or Cheney ever spent there. Boo-yah!"
1,A strange and speciously argued book,"What a strange and speciously argued book we have here. The basic thesis is that if you do not agree with Laura Ingraham, you are an `elite,' no matter if you are a dirt-poor farmer. If you do not support her ideology you are anti-American. What an odd woman indeed - plus the book is not enjoyable to read. A total waste of ink and paper."
2,Simon Cowell Wannabe,"Has Ingraham ever won an Oscar? Didn't think so. So how can she judge Oscar winners? She lampoons the ""elitist"" intentions of the Hollywood crowd yet Ingraham has NEVER even won an Emmy, let alone been nominated for a Tony. So do us all a favor Ingraham and win a Grammy before badmouthing multiple Grammy winner John Mellencamp."
4,Cartoon done as a graphic novel.,"This was an awesome graphic novel/cartoon. It was well done. It is a good story, and done from the view of Loki instead of Thor as most of the movies or comics are done."
3,It's ok but not Great,"This shows the Thunder God in a lesser light, as the thunder god one would think he would be able to handle the trickiest but maybe not. Over-all its ok but not a must see."
2,WHY MARVEL ANIMATION VARIATIONS?,"I am a huge fan of Marvel animation, and have collected many of DVDs from Marvel and DC including the Justice League, X-Men, Avengers, Batman AS, Hulk vs Thor and others, which are all creative, artistic and visually entertaining. I have viewed scenes from Loki and Thor; Blood Brothers, but did not care for the animation format and my question is why such drastic variations in the visual animation format from the same production company? I would think the fans would appreciate some consistency in this area, just as in voice casting."
4,Good video,A little different from most stories I have seen of Thor and Loki The process of how they got the comic book in to the video was interesting. Using some of the actual art fro the comic in the video and mapping it on to 3d models was very interesting. I must say it wasn't always effective but it was interesting. Some of the movement of the 3d models was not well done not very smooth and was a bit stiff but overall I liked it well enough.
1,Worst comic strip movie.,"Great art but horrible plot. It didn't develop the story enough as to how Loki defeated and captured Thor. Loki is cast as weaker, smaller, and much older than Thor. The entire production is a close up of Loki talking as if he is in a Renaissance Fair. The dialog was so bad that at one point Loki and Thor's mother Frigga discuss how she didn't breastfeed him. She tells him she couldn't. Then they discuss how she is not his mother. She refers to Odin as his father and Loki responds that if she is not his mother then Odin cannot be his father. Which we all know that just because Frigga is not the mother doesn't mean Odin can't be the father. I felt like someone in High School wrote the dialog as it was poorly written and boring."
4,diffrent but good.,movie was not what I was expecting but a good story and intersting graphics. it could use more dimentions but over all a good series.
1,Nice Try,"Somewhere in a storytelling universe where writer's know that stories should have a beginning, a middle and an ending this video book is a top seller. Unfortunately we are not in that universe. While I do not need for the author to give me every minute detail of the story, important story events should not be glanced over like the seeds at the bottom of the popcorn bag. Question from the begining ""How does Loki defeat Thor?"" It is hinted that he had help but for whom and how? Question from the middle ""How does Loki defeat Thor's powerful friends and Odin?"" Question from the ending ""How does Thor defeat Loki with such ease at the end?"" Mr. Thorn please before you take up the challenge of writing a story about a great classical hero again start with a less evolved character like Donald Duck. My follow comic book lovers save your money, this one is a 1/2 star."
2,Thor,Good story line. Bad art work. Very bad ending. Marvel dropped the ball on this one. Do not buy this!!!!
3,interesting,"This is a good book for architecture students. There you 'll find an introduction to the use of scripting in architectural design, algorithms, students projects and even MEL code.Nevertheless I think the first half of the book is forgettable, there the author tries to come up with a BIG theory for design, and falls short."
4,Very Strong Synth Pop,"If you like simple, linear 4x4 dance music then you should love this German synth pop group. Delay makes electronic music that is straightforward and uncomplicated, focusing on catchy melodies, strong hooks, obvious vocal verses and heavy beats. The heaviness of the beat could make this music borderline industrial but the direct pop approach wouldn't quite fit that scene.There are only 2-3 throwaways leaving at least 10 good songs. One of the best is ""Underdocs"", a tribute to Doc Martens boots. ""Wasting My Time"" has a hook reminiscent of the Pet Shop Boys ""Domino Dancing"". Most of the time Andy sings the vocals, but occasionally hands off to Corinne to add female vox to the sound. ""Stay"" is probably the best female-led track.If you like electronic pop take a chance on this Delay album."
3,you have to have the game in your computer to play That sucks.,Idont think I would have got this game if I knew you have to have the cd in the compute to play .
3,was alright,so-so....could have been better.I bought it to kill boredom.. but it merely wounded it some.
2,very incomplete,"Where are the 1986, 1987 and 1989 AFC Championships? 1997 and 1998 afc championships? 1991 divisional playoff vs houston?"
1,This is a travesty,"Let me start out first by saying that I love the three Bronco games on this DVD set; however, there is only three games! How is it that, in this same series, the Green Bay Packers and Dallas Cowboys have 10 games a piece on their respective sets. Why do they get special treatment and the Broncos get the shaft? There are numerous games that could have been added to this collection. The AFC Championship game featuring the Cleveland Browns featuring ""the drive,"" probably one of the greatest games in NFL history. What about the Denver vs Kansas City games featuring Joe Montana. There are at least 10 great games the Broncos participated in and yet here we get 3, does that make sense? I'm very disappointed. I only hope that the NFL reissues a set with at least 10 Bronco games because right now--this is a disgrace!"
3,"Good start, but missing some key games","I am not a Broncos fan, but brought this set anyway because of the superbowls, I am collecting these greatest games set from different teams, I have the Dallas Cowboys set and the Pittsburgh Steelers.With the broncos, they should have added the 1986 NFC Championship game as well as some of the other great games in Broncos history. But the set is not all bad, Reliving the Broncos defeating the Oakland Raiders 01/01/78 was great. Lyle Alzado, Tom Jackson and other Broncos greats.I am sure you Broncos fans will want to relive these great games forever.I recommend them for your collection."
3,These NFL FIlms release are getting SOOO Confusing.,"These NFL FIlms release are getting SOOO Confusing.If this set has the 1999 Super Bowl, why not make it a ""ROAD TO THE 1999 Super Bowl"" releases and have the playoffs of 1999 and then the superbowl.There are all these different sets, with a few game here and a few game there. NFL films is doing a terrible job of releasing games.I am a music and Movie collector, and I think I know how many collectors think.We want ENTIRE seasons, not 3 games from 3 different years just because they were good games. I would watch the boring games where my team loses too, because I like to watch the progression of my favorite teams throughout the year.NFL films should concentrate on releasing each superbowl, packaged with all the pay off games first. THen look at releasing the entire seasons of the superbowl winner.ps. and start releasing on blu-ray !!!"
2,Not well made,"While this seemed like a good product at a good price, mine fell apart shortly after buying. The bottom cap will not stay on mine making it a hassle to use. There has to be better quality thermometers out there."
1,timing belt,wrong part on search.cant return once package is open and dont know it is wrong one until you open it
4,the real deal,"Many contemporary listeners will eat up any old version of Pachelbel's Cannon like it was candy. Most versions out there are redundant hash. Here, however, is a fantastic version done well on period instruments. This is more like it."
3,No story - good looking girls,"Of the two movies, The Beast is better than The Monster. No full frontal nudity in the movies (there is in ONE one trailer), but loaded with T&A. DVD package well designed with tons of extras: trailers and vintage short nudie movies from the early century (the 20th that is...) Warning: no story and no acting !"
3,Exactly what you should expect,"Ultra cheesy, bad acting and a weak story line. Pretty much sums this double feature up. But if your like me, a lover of the old school B rate movies.... you should enjoy this dvd."
4,Fun,"I'm not a huge Phlinx fan, but I have a pogo.com account and thought I would try this to see how game play varies from the website. The game play is different than that of pogo.com's version making this game unique. I love pogo games and this game gives it a different twist."
2,Cannot Save Progress,The game will not allow you to save your progress when you quit. Annoying to have to start all over every time you want to play the game especially since there is a story line. Would not recommend this.
2,You cant save it,"I bought this game for my mom...installed it and apparently you cant save your progress. Even the manual doesnt say anything about ""saving"" your game....and thats a joke. Dont waste your time."
2,turn a bowl with ernie conover,this book was not as helpful as I had hoped it was a repeat of other books and I was not really satisfied with it as much as I had anticipated
2,"Boring and... well, a little dumb","I hate to rip an author apart, but this book just kind of stinks. The characters aren't really believable, and you don't even care about getting to know them. The story is just kind of trite and, frankly, not really worth the time it takes to read it if you have the ability to do something more worthwhile, like sleep or go to the bathroom. It's a fairly easy read, though, so you wouldn't have to be too much into self-abuse to get through it if you really felt you must."
3,An entertaining read,"I think this is one of Fisher's best books. She takes her knowledge of Hollywood, combined with her own experiences of life in Hollywood and turns it into a surprisingly funny book."
3,Disappointed,"That is true that Super Bowl II in NOT included. I'm very disappointed that games from the Lombardi era are not included. The 10 greatest games in this DVD are:1996 Super Bowl XXXI - Packers vs. Patriots2007 NFC Divisional Playoff - Packers vs. Seahawks2003 Packers Vs. Raiders1992 Packers vs Bengals2003 NFC Wild Card Playoff - Packers vs. Seahawks1997 NFC Championship Game - Packers vs. 49ers1983 Packers 48, Redskins 471995 Packers vs. Bears1996 Packers vs. 49ers1996 NFC Championship - Packers vs. Panthers"
2,"THIS is the ""best""??","The oldest game here is from 1983! Where is the ""Ice Bowl"", the 1967 NFL championship game? And oh, wasn't there TWO other Super Bowl games played and won by the Packers?? Who were the fans that voted on this!?"
5,You Idiot....,To the fool that's complaining about the set not including the FULL games......Are you that big of a moron? It clearly shows TEN Discs in the picture. It also was stated on the Packers website that each game is in FULL. Good lord..
4,Great set for Packer fans!,"YES, THIS IS COMPLETE GAMES AND 10 DISCS!!!I just got this in the mail last week and I have had a chance to start watching the games and it is great! The video quality is surprizingly good so far (I haven't watched the game from 83 yet). The only thing keeping this from a 5-star would have been some extras.Also, if the NFL could ever package these with an alternate audio tracks, say, the official Packers radio broadcast it would be amazing, but that is kind of a wish list. Commentary tracks would be welcome too.Still, wish list aside, this set is amazing! Complete NFL games at watch at your leasure!"
1,misleading,"""The Wisdom of Eleanor Roosevelt"" by Donald Wigal, PhD was my book club's selection for this past month. I was excited to learn more about Eleanor Roosevelt's life. I had no background info on her before I bought the book. Once I received this ""biography"", I found that nearly half of the book contains nothing but QUOTES from her. Another large portion of the book are her ""My Day"" syndicated columns. At the end of the book is her obituary.Being someone who did not have any background knowledge of Mrs. Roosevelt, I was SORELY disappointed with this book. Others in my book club felt the same way as well.In my opinion, the only way this book offers any value is as a SUPPLEMENT to a Real biography of Eleanor Roosevelt."
4,Large print version,"I ordered the large-print version for my 96 year old grandmother. I liked that the stories were short stories, as her attention span comes and goes, and certainly the large print is what she needed to be able to see the words. I think that she will appreciate the old fashioned writing and language of the book as well. I highly recommend this for a senior citizen. It makes a nice gift."
1,Screwed Over,"I ordered three of these sharks in bulk, and although Amazon stipulates that ""sharks may vary"", you think they could have at least sent me more than one kind out of three. See if I ever do this again..."
1,Very disappointing,"My daughter got this set for christmas. The way the pieces were made to work together is overwhelming for children. I was shocked to find that each item (stroller, swing, highchair) was made to have the carseat velcro or sit on it to work. It never hooked up evenly to the swing and the seat flipped over every time. The bars of the items are cheap plastic that is so flexible that it broke within a month. Bottom line is you could take this money and buy each piece seperately and have much more durable items."
1,Pure Garbage,This whole video is based on twisted facts and outright lies. The author Joanne Fletcher has been banned from entering Egypt. Her career is over because of the absolute abuse of the facts. The mummy she identified as Nefertiti has been proven to be a teenage boy. The Discovery Channel should be ashamed of themselves.
3,so so...,I saw this on televison on the Discovery channel and was rather let down by it. It was so repetitive that they could have trimmed down the time from 2 hours to one hour
3,Kate Winslet has nothing to do with this specific DVD!,"Katers beware...This is NOT the version that Kate narrated. In fact her name is not in the credits, nor does she ever appear in the DVD. Kate narrated the BBC, British version that aired on TV but not this one.If you are an Egyptian lover than by all means add this to your collection but do not purchase it, hoping to add on to your Kate collection. Don't make the same mistake I did!The DVD is good quality and the scientific background/exploration is very interesting but I agree the time frame could have been shortened. It was too long. I think an hour long special would have been much more effective."
1,Not my cup of tea,Couldn't read more than half. Too much going in & the ghoulish relationships with the dead turned me off to finishing the novel
5,Colonialism,"This was a highly unexpected joy to read. I am part of a book club & this year we picked Colonialism as a subject matter . After my last 2 books it was very refreshing, lots of humor & kept me in my chair."
3,If only the ending were better,"I loved this book for most of it. No use repeating other reviewers, it was excellent in many ways, just as most reviewers have stated, until the end...when...huh? It was never made clear just who was trying to set up who....and then from out of nowhere there's some mention of ...Americans?...when were Americans ever mentioned before?...seemed liked he decided it was time to end his fun and entertaining debut and so he did. Until the last 30 pages, I would have 5 starred it."
3,"Not badly written, but more fantasy than mystery","I enjoyed the story and setting (post-Communist Laos) in this book, and the main character was well-written and interesting. However, the supernatural plays a HUGE role in this book, and not one that can be lightly dismissed. The book commits the mortal sin of having ghosts and woodland spirits (yes, woodland spirits) give the main character clues that he needs to solve his problems. Instead of enriching the story, this makes the narrative appear rushed and disorganized. Also, the ending was simply terrible and looks as if it was added at the last second. Despite a rich background and interesting characters, this book fails to deliver a coherent mystery and instead relies upon the mysterious to fill in holes in the narrative."
5,just lovely,"It's all been said -- a wonderful read mixing humor, intrigue, and a wonderful sense of place. This is a really unique book. I'm looking forward to the next Dr. Siri Paiboun mystery."
3,pretty ok,"i was excited by the idea of this book as it seemed to contain subject matter that fascinates me (south east asia, shamanism, murder mystery). it got off to a slow start and my feeling the whole time was that the culture wasn't being communicated very well. it wasn't until about half way through that the culture of Laos began to come through. even then i felt it was inauthentic and that i was reading something by an author who was not of Laos culture which in fact is true though i understand Cotterill has spent a great deal of time there. still it was entertaining and worth while and i have ordered the second book in the series to see if he delves deeper into Hmong shamanism."
4,Cuts through stucco like butter.,"This hole saw is just over 4 inches in diameter, so the hole can accommodate a 4 inch dryer vent. It cuts fast through stucco (so far only up to 3/4 inch) and chicken wire. Probably will do metal lathe but I don't know yet. It is best to switch out to a toothed holesaw for OSB and plywood. You don't need to have super fast RPM's to get through the material. I just with I had bought one before I ruined 2 toothed holesaws on other dryer vents. C'est la vie."
3,"Only 1"" cutting depth","Advertised as 1-3/4 inch cutting depth but the Milwaukee 4-3/8"" (and all the others) have a cutting depth of less than 1"". Better than Greenless but a lot less than the Lenox or Morse grit hole saws. Bought this to cut ceiling holes in plaster for some Juno recessed light cans but the plaster and wood lath was too thick and the hole saw bottomed out before it cut all the way through.Even the Hole Pro adjustable hole cutters have a greater cutting depth at 1-1/8"" and one hole cutter can be used for every recessed can light cutout from 2"" up to 9"" in size."
4,how do i put firewire on this lap top?,"is it possible for additional firewire conection for this lap top? like pcimcia card or something? it has a very small slot, im not sure whats for?"
3,NOT TO HAPPY,"I BOUGHT IT 30 DAYS AGO, AND IT HAS SOME PROBLEMS WITH THE AUDIO. I AM REALY DISAPPOINTED."
1,WIFI problem and ultimately will not boot at all,"I have a HP Pavilion tx1000 which i bought a year ago. The registration and the internet service pop up kept on appearing even though i already completed registering and already answered ""never remind me again"". The WIFI also kept on disconnecting and have to restart over and over to get it started. As of now, the computer is totally dead. I followed the instructions in the HP website but has no luck. There is power going thru the battery but it does not respond to any FUNCTION keys. Avoid this laptop."
1,Do not purchase this notebook.,"I bought this computer on my own and spent about [...] dollars.I've had this laptop for about 17 months. Lately, I have been having problems with it booting up. I have learned this is a very COMMON problem with this model. HP will not give me any assistance in replacing it, even though it was their fault. It's ridiculous. They just want me to give them [...] bucks to put TOWARDS fixing it. YA RIGHT! I will never buy an HP product again. Anyone with this problem should call them and tell them! I know a lot of people are having this problem with theirs. Let them know about it!"
1,Dead after a 13 months,"After 13 months of using this computer the motherboard died and as someone else already said, it costs over 400 dollars (if you are in the USA) to repair it. Where I live, it costs over 800 dollars to repair it. I have also heard of other people with the same problem. I am not buying HP again."
4,excellent notebook,"PROwhat you see is what you get. its quite small and very light, excellent for those who travel alot. the touch screen is nice and the screen is amazing. there are buttons which control your entertainment theatre located on the screen for easy access and activation. For such a small notebook the volume is amazing.CONthe features for this notebook listed on the site stated it had 1 firewire port and 1 headphone port, well when my notebook arrived it had no fire wire port and 2 headphone imput ports. i was very disappointed in not getting the firewire port i paid for."
2,Stay away!!,"I bought this laptop (tx1000) a bit over a year ago. I loved it in the beginning, I thought it was a great little laptop, until I started having problems with the wireless connection a few months ago...I found no solution to that (even with HP technical support), it just comes and goes, so I got a usb wireless adapter. I thought that would be the end of my problems, but today it failed to boot... I am reading here that this is common and that the laptop eventually dies. I have read a lot of comments from users that have the same exact problem. I am VERY VERY disappointed. I expected more from HP. Avoid this computer."
2,Don't Waste Your Time Or Cash,"I was expecting way more than this. The problem with this album is suprisingly - the production. The beats weren't catchy, they were uninteresting, and some were just straight up terrible. Other songs that the RZA screws over is ""Chi Kung"" where he sounds like he is dying when he raps. Some parts of that song make you wonder if the RZa is a has-been. Other wack tracks are ""Grits"" and ""Wherever I Go"". In fact, insert any track and it's probably wack. The only reason it didn't get 1 star from me is because there's one okay song ""Fast Cars"". Other songs like ""A Day to God is 15,000 Years"" makes you want to use the cd case as a drink coaster."
4,Solid,"Though it doesn't have any certain classic songs, RZA comes through with a overall enjoyable product. One can listen to the entire thing without skipping a track. RZA's voice is interesting, sometimes sounding drunk, sometimes near crying, and on Tai Chi it sounded like he hadn't slept in days. He talks about some strange stuff here, too. Not the best album, but worth the money.3.75/5"
2,WORST RZA CD EVER!!!,"THIS IS NOT A GREAT CD FROM THE RZA WHO USUALLY IS ON POINT WITH THE LYRICS AND PRODUCTION MOST OF THE SONGS SOUNDS TO MAINSTREAM AND ALOT OF WACKASS GUEST APPEARANCES GRITS WUZ THE GREATEST SONG ON THE CD RZA SOUNDS A WHOLE LOT BETTER ON THE WU CD'S I DONT THINK HES A GREAT SOLO ARTIST BUT DIGITAL BULLETS IS THE ONLY SOLO I LIKE FROM HIM, ANYWAYS THIS CD GAVE ME A HEADACHE AND MAJORITY OF IT IS GARBAGE TO ME SO DONT WASTE UR MONEY ON THIS."
3,Best Solo of all-time????,"Are you crazy, you obviously must not be a die hard Wu fan. Listen to OB4CL or Ironman or Liquid Swordz and even Masta Killa's new one. Its not a bad CD, but is definitely not a top Wu solo album."
2,what a depressing man,"this is a bad album just considering it on it's own terms but in light of wu tang's albums, especially ""enter"" this is just terrible. RZA's beats are average fare, some being pretty good (though none as well done, or nearly as well done at that, as the king of producers, Madlib!), but what's really bad are the lyrics, how much can one guy talk about new jeans and Glocks so extensively? Without lyrics what is a hip hop album good for, not much except nodding your head to"
3,Overrated,"Deffinetly overrated. The beats are good (mostly) but i just don't feel Rza's lame-ass flow. Don't get me wrong, the album is ok, but how is it a classic? How can it measure up to Big Pun's Capital Punishment, or Mobb Deep's Infamous or Hell On Earth, or Jedi Mind Tricks - Violent By Design, or Pac's Me Against the World, or Mos Def's Black On Both Sides?! I mean, those are the cds that are 5 stars, but y'all should realize that you can't give every Wu-Tang album 5 stars just because it's a Wu-Tang album! There isn't a single instant classic on this album. And The Rza is not THAT-GOOD of a producer. His beats are made out of loops and samples that just go over and over again, and get very irritating! The best song to me is A Day To God...Sorry if I insulted a few non-eye-oppeners but this is just my opinion. Is suggest you buy Shyheim's Lost Generation or something alternative like Sage Francis - Personal Journals or Virtuoso - The Voice Of Reason."
3,wu tang founder,this man is so good and has so much credibility from the wu that anything he puts out as a solo project will be tremendously special.
2,ONE GOOD SONG,"This puppy is wack. I am sure its possible it'll get better with repeated listenings, but this stuff makes you DREAM of Bobby Digital!"
2,"Buy ""World According To RZA"" instead!","This ""Birth of a Prince"" is more like ""Re-emergence of a Jackass""... I am a huge Rza fan but this is only more of what I DON'T like about him. Cursin', Wu-references, get drunk & f***... c'mon, turn the page already. I had high hopes for this CD but the cover art and title are the best things about it! They give the impression that it will be a rebirth for him. But although his intellect and vision always give you hope that he could do something great, he hardly does on this disc. The first track is hot, the rest are lame which is ironic since this year's ""World According To RZA"" is probably the best Hiphop album of the year! Buy that cause it's sick as hell. I liked ""Digital Bullet"" a lot too, though many hated on it. But just pick up ""World According To RZA"" and prepare to have your mind opened."
5,Don't listen to these two/one star people,"Look, this album is great, unique and different, I know people here are comparing it to his last albums........but those were bobby digital albums. He's now come out with his first official RZA album, ""Birth of a Prince"". You might not like too much of the first half but as you get towards the end, RZA rewards you with some really good songs, like ""The Birth"", pure excellent lyrics and you'll be playing this track over and over. I can't belive people are saying the lyrics are weak, show me an album that came out the same year that has better. Production is more polished and even though he didn't do as much on this album like the bobby digital albums, other producers still bring in tight beats like ""Fast Cars"" and ""A Day To God Is 1000 years"". If your a wu-tang fan or are just looking for good albums to widen your music collection, this should be ordered or bought now.......it's a great album."
4,odyssey,"What happens when you combine 5 percent mysticism, folklore, innovative hip hop production, b-boyism, and battle poetry? You get the Rza, the architect behind The Wu-Tang. To me, this album is the embodiment of the ultimate folk song (that's right you moaning hip-hop heads, the Rza is ""folk like that."" Understand the word.). Bob Dylan sang of desolation, Bob Marley sang of redemption, and now Bob Diggs (rip) gives us the birth of a Prince. Sad to say, many people can't understand why the Rza became Digital in his past few albums, and maybe if they stop to listen to this WHOLE album and not just a few songs, then they'd understand that Digital was a part of his life and of the way he experimented on his production. And now we finally get introduced to the (final?) stages of the God. I can't wait for the Cure..."
2,i was shocked,"the worst rza album to date - and im not hatin. the first song leaves u thinkin this album could be crazy but as the songs pass u realize this is far from the truth - the most fustrating thing about this album is that everytime u think u may have a good song someone drops a disgraceful verse that is no where near worthy of the beat its over. i can see that rza has came up and is now trying to introduce his boyz into the game so that they can eat and so can their children and their wak rhymes make rza's charity obvious. although this is what any real man who loves his people would do, for the sake of his reputation he should do it in small doses. EVERY RZA VERSE IS DOPE and almost every guest apperance is hopeless. if rza went solo this album would have been absolutely brilliant - which leaves me bitterly dissapointed but i will still but his next album my luv 4 the wu is unconditional"
2,Disgrace to All That is WuTang,"I sorry I have to say it, but this is the worst Wu release yet, and RZA is my favorite member.(I can't believe that I went out and bought this album the day it came out.)RZA is famous for being a great lyrist and producer.Both of these are lacking on this album. The beats, to be generous, are tolerable.The guest contributions make this album even worse.Ex. (from ""We Pop"")""All you can see is the back of my jersey, blowin' in the wind goin' back to (New) Jersey. Off to Brooklyn, left you back in (New) Jersey. I was doin' a buck 90 like a throw-back jersey.""Wow! He managed to rhyme jersey with jersey 4 times, his mother should be proud.I would recommend, instead: Gravediggaz - 6 FEET DEEP; RZA - THE RZA HITS; or RZA AS BOOBY DIGITAL (IN STEREO)"
1,The downfall of the Wu-Tang is sealed.,"Ok, first of all i've been a fan of the WU since day one and for me to write this is sad. I don't know what happened to this mighty force but man what a sad time. Slowly their releases got worse and lazy and less creative on the production tip and on the rhymes . For this to be done by the RZA himself and this to me is the worst RZA release to date. The rhymes are lazy and be done before and just plain boring. If you are a true WU fan you're probably going to buy this anyway but i would just save your $. It's sad to say but because of their own laziness & their loss of that hunger they have become just an ok hip hop group. Also how can the Wu have so many artist on their roster and it takes them soooo long to put out albums. Where is masta killas album, hell they have been a group for 10 years and he can't put out a single album in that time. Anyways i can go on on how they have fallen."
4,worth it!,"the cd starts off a little unoriginal, but makes up for it with the last track! tracks like ""wherever i go"" or ""a day to god is 1,000 years"" are really good. i commend rza with this release. birth of a prince in the land of unoriginal cds"
2,Disappointing,"The wu is done... simple as that. Take a look for yourself The ""W"" and Iron Flag had their respective bangers but the rest of the cd was faaar from the glory days of wu. Their current respectable albums out are ""Legend of a Liquid Sword"" and ""Supreme Clientele"". Now take a look at this garbage that the rza is trying 2 pull off as creative... if he doesn't smarten up and lay off the wack, wu tang's image will be permanently ruined. It's gotten so bad that there's not even a buzz for the new Raekwon album (cross your fingers it doesn't suck too). Do yourself a favour, if u haven't already, pick up the classics Raekwon's ""only built 4 cuban linx"" or ""36 chambers"". Peace."
3,what this is right here.......,"Basically, this album gets a 5 for the amount of knowledge dropped on it. A day to God is 1,000 years, what you telling them on that cut man?The production gets kind of slow. The rap style, the man just free styles. He's a ill freestyler, however I payed $16 for what's basically Rza freestyling to some slow beats.The Birth and A day to God... make it worth it, and Grits is just classic right there. I say dub/download this one and wait for ""the Cure""."
3,Why do I keep doing this to myself?,"Let me start by saying I'm a fan of the RZA. I think his beats are crazy. And his rhymes kind of grow on me because his style is so unique and almost unpolished. So I get excited everytime he drops a new CD. But every CD has only 3-4 hot joints. After a while, all his beats start to sound the same. Maybe he spoiled me with the Wu's first album and I'm still waiting for something to approach that level? If I had to do it again, I wouldn't have dropped the $$$ on this."
4,Good for a little kid,I got this for my 2 year old and he loves it! I'm not sure I would get it for a child any older than maybe 4 because it is not very big an is made of very thin vinyl. Our gator has not popped but no one has been rough with it. It's your typical float in a fun shape.
2,Reads like a rough draft,"I had really high hopes for this book - but was disappointed at the writing style - both husband and wife share their views on the same things - trading back and forth. Makes for a very redundant read. I really tried to get into the book and extract some child-rearing tips, but wading through the dry pages was eventually more tedium than I could endure. Actually, it's not that surprising, owing to the fact that both parents are doctors and teachers - they write as if they are filling out a report."
4,Great Value!,"I bought two of these amps to run 2 12"" mtx Subs. If you use heavy gauge power and ground wires along with a good capacitor and quality speaker wire you will have a thumping system. I actually had these bridged AND running 2 ohm loads (friend hooked them up wrong). I didn't realize it until a week later, but they never overheated and thumped like no other. I ended up leaving them at 2ohms bridged cuz they worked so good. I'm not sure why I got away with those amps running such a low ohm bridged, but I'm guessing that 0 gauge power (with 1 farad cap) and 8 gauge speaker wires helped a bit. Oh and I did replace the 10amp fuses with 20 amps as soon as I got them out of the box (10amp fuses? I changed them so I wouldn't get laughed at.) I recently got some Alpine 10"" Type-R subs and these amps will not push them, but if you are building a low budget system they work great. I paid $99 for the pair... GREAT VALUE!!!"
3,Good Amp for the Price,"Amp works great for the price. Does get pretty hot when being operated, due to the vents being on the bottom side of the amp"
2,false advertisement,"ALWAYS, ALWAYS, ALWAYS find out the RMS before you buy an amp! I didn't do it this last time thinking if the amp says 1400 watts the rms should at LEAST be 250w per channel. WRONG! Not even close! More like 90w. Thats so rediculous it's not even funny. Still it was my fault for not doin my homework on the product BEFORE I bought it. Learn from my mistake, Don't do it if your looking to push 200-300w out an amp. This one sucks."
2,It's as cheap as the price.,"It's as cheap as the price. You get what you pay for, if you have a simple system then you could play with this amp but if you looking to have a good system that make your music move clearly and for a long time then this is not for you at all. I went to a few audio show and people were literally making fun of my because I thought that this amp was going to move my 12"" Kickers 1400 watts. They said this amp will move the but it will sound like crap and it won't last for long eventually it will burn out and you'll have to get another one and another one and another one....lol"
3,"Prelim info, review to follow install","I really appreciate feedback on Amazon (as well as other places) to help me make my purchasing decisions. I've rarely been steered wrong and I try to help out as well with my honest feedback. Now while it SAYS this amp is rated for 700/1400 watts we all should know that for the price listed that is HIGHLY unlikely. Surely they're basing it on ""Peak Output"" instead of the much more realistic RMS rating.I bought this for my wife's truck to go with the 10"" Pyle bandpass box. I haven't installed either yet but I did want to let you know the more detailed specification info listed inside the box.Output power @ 14.4v DC, 1KhzRMS power @ 4 Ohms - 80w x 2RMS power @ 2 Ohms - 140w x 2Max power output - 700w x 2 (I'm assuming that's the math they're using to get the ""1400"" rating)RMS bridged power output @ 4 Ohms - 160w x 1I'll post more once it's installed and (hopefully) thumping!"
1,Very Very Overrated!!!!,"Beware, this amp is only 80 watts x 2 and 150 watts x 1 bridged. It doesn't put out much bass at all, even with the bass boost all the way up. If you're looking to shake your neighborhood this will not do it. I haven't had any overheating issues though. this would be a good little amp to power one sub with modest sound but not for someone who wants real ground shaking bass. I just counted my losses and went with an alpine m500."
1,DO NOT BUY PYLE,"Pyle creates crappy car audio gear. They rate their amps by MAX output (must be hit by lightning to reach this wattage).It has 2 10A fuses. That means it will produce MAYBE 200 watts (any more will blow the fuses). So to rate it a 1400 watt amp is flat out lying.If you want a cheap amp that actually does rated power, try Phoenix Gold, or Hifonics. They have amps in the same price range that actually put out better power, won't overheat or blow up, and is a far better value."
1,Very unimpressive amp,"I bought this amp expecting to upgrade from my 1000 watt amplifier.. NOT. This amp sucks, install was easy and everything but it does not knock at all. Even after the bast boost it still sucks. My 1000 watt amp pushes easily 3 times harder than this one. If your lookin to slap this amp is not for you, this is just for someone who wants a tiny bit of bass. No wonder why it's so cheap.. sent it back very disappointed dont waste your time or money"
5,Lot more Powerful then I thought it would be,I bought this to power my crappy dual 600 watt sub in my little s10 and to my surprise it hits pretty hard.I was a little iffy after reading some reviews but it is worth the moneyI just ordered a kicker compvr 800 watt and i cant wait to see how it performs with that
4,very good amp for cheap,i did like the amp a lot i have a few months with it and it lasts the bass sounds great if you know how to install them
1,POOOP,Ok so i was looking for an amp at a lower price and this one seemed perfect for what I need it for. I received it yesterday hooked it up all right. I have my power wire (8g) on the left side of my car and the rca's and remote on the left. My rca's are in the head unit in the right outputs the amp is completely wired right it has a perfect ground the ohms match up right and I'm not bridging it. So the protect light comes on as soon as I turn the radio on. Even with no speaker or rca's just power and ground. I'm very disappointed I've tested my wire three times there are no shorts in the wire or my fuse would blow.. I just don't understand why this is happening. RETURNED!
1,Not happy,"Worked great for about two months but it recently stopped working. Checked the fuse and changed wires still nothing, green light was on the entire time so guessing it was an internal problem. Had it hooked to 1 12' inch pioneer. For the price it's almost not worth it, better to put 20 bucks into a Better one."
1,This did not meet my expectations,"Well I gave this Idea to someone for Christmas,I got it and I didn't get it put in my truck for a few weeks. I went and bought an amp install kit for this amp. Hooked it all up. It worked pretty good but was not near what I would expect for a 1400watt amp.a day later it just stopped working. I tried fuses checking my wiring and everything. It was the amp. It shorted itself somehow.needless to say i returned it. Got screwed over big time because I payed $65 for it and only got $40 in amazon credit back.think before you buy. Go get a better name one your already spending $70."
1,Did Not Work..AT ALL,"Didnt push a single note.. it blew my mind.. it showed it was powered, i switched through 2 RCAs, switched remote location, still not a single sound.. must of been defective.. its played games with my mind, got me thinkin 'is it my head unit? the subwoofer?'..came to the conclusion ill start with returning the amp the day after recieving it..ugh.. probably worth spending a lil more on something with a decent RMS , not that i know what this sounded like through my single 10"".."
1,Junk,Just tried hooking this up to my 2 12's and it did not even work. Everything is hooked up correctly because my other Amp(Alpine) works perfectly. The thing is complete JUNK. Do not buy this product.
1,NOT WORTH IT!,"I bought this amp to power my 10's. After installing it, the 10's were hitting really hard. The only problem was that later I turned off the car and left. When I came back the amp wasn't working. I tested everything and the amp was the only thing that was not working."
3,gayness,"its a okay amp, its not very good but it gets the job done. it gives out a good amount of watts but i dont think its pushin 1400 like it says its supposed too!"
1,Hate it,"This amp gave me nothing but trouble. Plus, it DEFINITELY doesn't put out 1400 watts. Im never buying cheap amps again..."
2,Don't Buy,These amps for one arent actually 1400 watts. Also they get really really hot and wont last long. Your better off saving up some money and buying something that will sound better and will last. Pyle amps are junk dont buy them.
3,"Not Bad, Not 1400 Watts, Not Even Close!","Not Bad, Fairly clean sound, compact and nice to look at? However I have a 400 watt amp that has more power! I mean for the price it should push an 8 to 10 inch sub OK but it doesn't move a 12 very good. I will use it for 2 8inch mids and see how that goes. I think it will last and like I said, it has really clean sound so just buy it with that in mind, it will work well but not for a large sub! Good Luck!"
2,was good but blew out,"i got this amp about 2 months ago as a graduation gift for my self along with 2 12"" MTX terminator subs. it worked really good at first but after awhile it started to distort my rear speakers i fixed the prob but soon after the amp blew ( about 8 days ago.) i worked well for the time hit hard and people would stop and look made me happy. but now im out the money and need a amp again good for if u need a quick replacement amp but don't keep for to long if you really like to blast your base and music like i do. im 18 i rock my beats loud and for long periods of time."
2,It's not that good,"this amp its not good for subwoofer, and its alright for voice, but I would not recommend it to nobody, it doen't matter what the price is"
5,amp,thank you for this product. It was very useful for my stereo. thanks againscott. You are an excelent seller.
3,amp,over heats at times but cant beat the price!! and doesnt happen all the time just if you use it longer than 20 minutes or so
1,smh,"this is the biggest piece of crap I ever bought. i hooked it up and it pushin my 10's like crazy, thats the only reason i give this a star. I turned my car off the when i went to go somewhere the amp just stop working. I went home everything was getting power excet the amp, it only lasted my just a half of a song. its powerful but will not last u at all"
1,Please read before buying,"I had a pair of 12"" Kenwood subs in a ported box. Got a 5.0 Farad capacitor. Bought an 8 gauge wiring kit. First, the amp's terminals can only handle 12 gauge wire, they use the mickey mouse style terminal and can't accomodate any bigger wire. I shaved down some of the wire, and got it all hooked up. It hit extremely hard. Sounded amazing. About a week or so later, the red light came on. I know quite a bit about electronics, and did some tests to find out what was wrong. An output transistor shorted, thus disabling the amp. These are not something you can simply order, so i just bought a different amp. Save money on other things, but an amp is where you want to save up and buy an alpine. Apparently that short is extremely common."
1,dont waste ur money,"It is as simple as this, look at the actual rms rating of this amp. brigded it puts out 160 watts. for the same price go to wallyworld, and get a dual brand amp. at least they are reliable. if u dont believe me, go check crutchfield, they dont sell boss pyramid or pyle. but they sell dual. that in itself is reason enough for me."
1,Worst ever..Dont waste your time,"I read reviews and thought this would be an OK starter amp..A cheap one...I wish I would have gone by the reviews...This product SUCKS! It overheats and shuts off..I was runnning 2 12"" subs on this...After that system failing me I went to a shop and spent $500 on good equipment and Im MUCH happier now..Save yourself the heartache and grief...Like the guy at the shop said...PYLE is a PILE of CRAP.."
3,Doesn't have speaker level input.,"It can take a beating, at least for me. I've had it for about a year. i liked the amp but it doesn't even come close to the output power it says. It can power speakers pretty good but not much power for running subs. it fits easy under seats. Doesn't have speaker level input."
4,Coffin Joe at his ghoulish best,"Brazilian filmmaker Jose Mojica Marins spent his career writing, directing and starring in violent psychosexual horror tales filled with graphic images of carnality, brutality, and torture. Not surprisingly, his work was banned in his native country. But now, thanks to DVD, his films are accessible to anyone who has the stomach for this sort of ghoulish fare.AT MIDNIGHT I'LL TAKE YOUR SOUL marked the first time Marins appeared as his onscreen alter ego ""Coffin Joe,"" a villainous Brazilian gravedigger who manages to break all Ten Commandments within as many minutes. This 1963 feature film may be Marins' best, mainly because it's more coherent than most of his other efforts.The Coffin Joe movies are often self-indulgent, tedious affairs, but Marins' complete lack of artistic restraint results in bone chilling moments of undeniable power. It's a body of work that is at once both revolting and compelling."
2,Not what I expected,"The one movie I was really interested in by Coffin Joe was not included in this set and the ones that are, are almost unwatchable. The comic set was the best part of this deal."
3,Not the best hat...but a good hat,"No doubt this is a good hat (thanks Tommy!)... I'm not denying it's a good hat, because it is. But it's just a tad overpriced. If you're going to pay over 5 grand for a hat you should look at Ronald's Hat or even Charles' Cap if you can afford something like that."
2,"Fifth Edition, yet still incomplete.","I've used the Nutrition Almanac, Third Edition, for years. This 'new' addition has very few updates compared to the third. It feels like it's written by someone working strictly with Western Medicine, even though it does give a person direction to some Natural treatments for the listed ailments. Also the book does not go too deeply into describing any vitamin or mineral.On the positive side, the Table of Food Composition is nice to use, even though it is incomplete. And the layout of the book is quite nice, making it easy to use compared to smaller books."
5,awesome !,"This item is in good shape ,arrived fast. Would recommend this item as a gift.One house should have this in the kitchen,"
1,Too stiff for most carpet... but also slips on hard surfaces,"Pros: Once you figure it out, the ""click in"" adjustable design is pretty cool.Cons: I'm using this product on a hardwood floor (which both the Goaler1 website and Perform Better advertise as perfectly acceptable), and there is slippage on just about every slide. I've cleaned the floor and the bottom of the board repeatedly with no difference. The bottom of the board is just not rough enough to keep it in place. I'm sure it's fine on carpet, but unless you have exactly the right kind you'll likely run into the same problem the other reviewer has had.Maybe, MAYBE if you are using this in a gym with tacky rubber flooring you'll have better luck. I wouldn't risk it.Bottom line: I wish I had paid attention to the other review and stayed away from this product. Don't buy."
5,This is the best and the most moving book I have ever read.,This is a great book I think that every preson ifcan should read it
1,For me these were trays of pain. (Tréswhite est trés douloureux),"I have only used one other tooth whitening system before, but the other one did not cause any pain or discomfort. With this kit, I have severe shooting pains in my teeth after about 10 minutes of use. My dentist told me that this is the brand she recommends for her patients, but I have had to discontinue the treatment after three 10-minute applications."
5,A recording of the century...really!,"Manze has outdone himself, as have the Academy of Ancient Music.There is life, there is magic, there is some beautiful playing, there is everything you could possibly want in a recording of this wonderful score. Even if you forego period instruments, you should really try these guys out! Forget Orpheus's attempt, and please ignore the bizarre recommendation for I Musici de Montreal on Chandos (great sound and cold playing). This recording really puts all those to shame.To top it all off, not only do you have wonderful music-making, but you also get intelligent and delightful notes that are humorous too.A first-class production. Maybe the classical music recording industry isn't dead quite yet!"
3,"good book, needs editing","I enjoyed the book, but it could use some editing. Large parts are repeated verbatim in what are apparently self-contained chapters. And his penchant for long footnotes is a bit annoying."
5,"Hoppe is correct, universal suffrage democracy has failed","The world seems to have adopted a ""conventional wisdom"" that the ultimate form of government is one-person-one-vote universal-suffrage democracy. Anyone who speaks against this ""conventional wisdom"" is labeled as cruel and stupid.Since the ""conventional wisdom"" is completely wrong and billions of people around the world are suffering because of bad-quality democratic government, it is refreshing to read a book where this problem is openly addressed.My only criticism is that instead of simply arguing the merits of democracy and monarchy, it could have been more interesting to break down democracy into two types: one-person-one-vote universal-suffrage democracy versus various types of democracy where voting is restricted.John Christmas, author of ""Democracy Society"""
2,"The same idea as in Ayn Rand's ""Atlas shrugged""","Hoppe's message:Mankind can allegedly be divided into two kinds of people: alpha-people, noble individuals who never need anybody else, hard-working, responsible, intelligent enterpreneurs on the one hand and beta-people on the other hand, who are allegedly only lazy lethargic bums who depend on a welfare state and by the indirect way of elections, state and taxes allegedly parasite from the hard working, intelligent, creative, alpha-people and thus exploit them.So the alpha-people should finally abandon the beta-people to their fate and form their own society, where neither any kind of taxes, nor any kind of state nor any kind of social welfare is needed, for intelligent, hard working alpha people allegedly don't need this kind of things.This is the message that Ayn Rand delivered in her famous novel ""Atlas Shrugged"" in 1957 already, and this is basically the same idea that Hoppe propagates in his book.Nothing new, thus."
1,Not what I expected,"Marion E. Warren said before he died that he photographed EVERYbuilding in the Charles Center area before it was torn down.That was what I was expecting, all of his old photos, or at least a greatcovering of fifties Baltimore.I could go downtown today and take most of these photos myself.If you are looking for historical photos of downtown Baltimore, don'tget your hopes too high."
3,a little too fake,ok i didn't expect anything from this book and i didn't get anything from this book. The main character starts out with no friends and ends up with no friends. She's a little overboard with the I love books thing. I mean she prizes books over friends and well.....it's just not a good read. I suggest you don't pick it up and say it looks interesting cause its a waste of your time.
3,These bags are small,"Unfortunately, these bags were too short to accomodate my suits.Amazon lists the length as 36 inches. A more accurate measurement is 35 inches.Otherwise, the bags are made of a heavy canvas material and appear to be solidly constructed. The is a VERY small piece of cedar sewn into a pouch toward the bottom of the bag. As far as I can tell, the cedar is not replaceable. It seems to be too small and flimsy to serve any real purpose.If your suits are made of a delicate fabric, you might reconsider these bags. The canvas is rough, not washed like a pair of chinos."
2,What you see is not what you get.........,"I wanted to get something with a clear view of the garment inside. The product description, the web picture, and even the picture on the cardboard of the actual package all show ""full front panel w/transparent window"", but what I got (15 in total!) was a canvas front with only a 3""x5"" window, not exactly what I thought....so beware, you may be in for a surprise. Perhaps that's one of the reasons why it's only $4.99 -- mislabeled packaging or incorrect content......."
3,Not roomy enough.,"The bag is pretty much as advertised, but just isn't quite big enough. I tlooks nice, but could be wider and longer."
4,"Well made, but comes up short","I ordered this to house my suits and jackets. I made an assumption, which is my fault, about what the product description led me to believe. It says it's for hanging suits, but it should say for waist jackets and short suits. I'm not a giant (I'm actually 6'3""), but none of the suits and jackets I intended to place in these bags hang freely. All are now bunched up and folded. The description listed the dimensions (36"" L), but like I said, I went off the written description. Don't make my mistake. Now with that out of the way, here are the bullets:Pros- Strong material- good seal where hanger comes through- Strong zipper- ample thickness to hand more than one item- Great price for construction and materials used.Cons- Site glass too small and only on one side, disallowing viewing ofother items if multi packed.- Mislabeled as suit bag. It will not allow an average suit to freelyhang. Should have used garment or shirt bag."
3,Short,"I like this, well enough, but for my Father, who is of regular size, the suit bags are short for his sleeves. And, a coat which is for a suit, is too long for the bag, as well. The bag needs another 4-6 inches in length."
3,"Nice suit bag, very short and no hanger included","The bag itself is well made, but unlike in the description, there is no hanger included with the bag. This is not a major problem for me, but it was detailed in the product description that the hanger was included. The suit bag seems short also; it was just barely long enough to fit my husband's suit."
4,One of the best clothes bag ever,I've been looking for such a product for years... quality clothes bag made of material. This is exactly what I was looking for....quality product. I am giving 4 stars instead of 5 because the bags are a little short.....5-6 inches longer would have great.
3,A Bit Wide and Stiff,"I still don't understand how they embedded cedar into the fabric, but it's a great idea, however, these are really stiff and wide. They hit the back of my closet and are tough to get clothes in and out. I'm used to nylon or a much more pliable material on my suits or jackets. They're made well and a great buy, but overall too large in width for my closet space. I had to return them."
1,Too Short,"This Suit Bag looks great and is well made, BUT it is too short for men's suits and certainly for dresses. It is about 5 inches shorter that other suit bags I have--the clothes roll up and wrinkle because they hit the bttom of the bag. Nice try, but no cigar."
4,No Longer Best Value for Money,"EDIT [June 2008]: Now that they raised the price from five bucks to eight bucks, I no longer stand by my 4 star rating. This is now an average bag for the price. The ""For Dummies"" bags are a good alternative in the price range. The eight dollar Rubbermaid canvas bag is sturdy and opaque; the eight dollar ""For Dummies"" canvas/plastic bagStorage For Dummies: Suit / Jacket / Garment Durable Canvas Storage Bagis sturdy and transparent. Most other garment bags on Amazon are either more expensive or flimsier. I wish I could edit/adjust my star rating down to 3 stars, but I can't. (Note: the Cedar Insert is so tiny that it took me months of use before I noticed it.)"
4,Better then expected.,"Although the image is incorrect, I much prefer that the suit bag came with an entire canvas front versus the vinyl. I seem to have bad luck with hangers or transportation ripping holes in the vinyl. The canvas is much sturdier and still has a window at the top, right so that you can see what is inside.There IS a cedar insert in each of the suit bags (at least there were in my three that I ordered). It's just enough to do the trick. If you unzip the bag and right towards the bottom there is a small cedar insert inside the bag. Overall great buy for the item that you receive. I'll be buying another three shortly!"
1,"Pretty short in length, and cedar is a joke!","I went back to look three times as I read the reviews and finally found one (1) cedar strip sewn into the front by the label. It is 1-1/8"" x 4-1/4"" piece of (presumably cedar) about as thick as an envelope w/ a short credit card bill inside. The bag is well made, but an inch short for my ""tall"" suite coat. The DAZZ bag at 2/3 the price is nicer. I got them both, expecting the Rubbermaid to be worth the money, but alas, it wasn't. Get three of the other for the price of 2 r-maids.+ nice material+ nice zipper- length is questionable and may cause wrinkles- PRICE IS WAY HIGH compared to competitiono Don't buy it for the Cedar!"
2,Decent BUT NOT Long Enough,"Rubbermaid Configurations Hanging Canvas Suit Bag with Cedar Inserts, Natural, #3F21I bought five of these garment bags thinking they would be an excellent purchase because of the price and because of the name but based upon the dimensions I was thinking that my suits would not fit in them properly. Needless to say, when I took them out of the packaging and placed my suits in them and hung them up, the bag is NOT LONG ENOUGH for the suits to fit without slightly wrinkling them.I think that Rubbermaid should have done their homework before putting out such an inferior product. A few more inches in length and width would greatly improve these bags. Also, I don't like having to pick off the pieces of canvas from my suits before I wear them. This was an unfortunate purchase and now I cannot return them because the packaging got thrown away."
1,Not as Advertised!,"First of all, there are NO cedar inserts!! Not even a place for them. The cardboard picture insert in the package shows a clear plastic full front to the suit bag, but when you open and take it out of the packaging, it's all cloth with a tiny 3 x 5 vinyl window. Even that's OK (but not what it claims) but I purchased it for the cedar inserts and there aren't any. FALSE ADVERTISING."
2,Good if you are a midget.,"This is well made. Great. But it is less than worthless for me. I wear a Long sportcoat, and this this is so short that a good 2 inches of fabric get bunched up in the bottom. I don't even think a REGULAR would fit properly! I'm going back to order something my suits can go into and not need pressing when I take them out. This really disappoints me, I thought the Rubbermaid name would mean something."
3,Lots of good recipes for breads and muffins.....,"The book is divided into: Introduction with lots of good infoSweet Muffins, Sweet Quick Breads, Savory Muffins & Breads, Biscuits & PopoversThe Introduction pages are several with explanations containing step by step photos on Baking Techniques, Making Muffins & Quick Breads, making Focaccia & Bread Sticks, and Making Biscuits & PopoversThe recipes are well illustrated with step by step instructions as well as the finished product and each recipe to a page, although in some instances there are 2 recipes to the page if they are short enough.Easy to read, easy to follow and no-fail recipes make me wish I had started using this book long ago when I first got it! I know I will start using it more often now that I really took the time to go over it and tried a recipe. The first recipe I tried, doing my usual substitution of mango for the apricot was the Pineapple and Apricot Bread."
3,Very brief,"It's a very brief book, small size, big print, quotations taking whole pages. While it covers some good ideas, it lacks meat. It can serve as a refresher, but definitely not a comprehensive coaching sourcebook."
3,Blanchard and Shula Ignite,"In Blanchard's signature style - two coaching masters at work - Don Shula and Ken Blanchard unite and ignite leaders to motivate performers to peek levels of performance. The Little Book of Coaching is crammed full of inspiration that will motivate even the most jaded coaches into creating a winning organization.One tip which is one of the richest offered in the book ""More important to setting goals is the follow up - attention to detail - demand for practice perfection.""The only problem was that after a while, I found myself skimming through the book to catch the nuggets of insight offered, rather the spending time reading through the entire book. The short bursts of insight really did not need further elaboration.Good book, if you need quick statements for motivation."
3,Mahler With Love,"Having been an afficionado of Mahler for over 50 years there was nothing much in this book I didn't know, but it was intersting and enjoyable nonetheless,particularly because of the heavy use of quotes from actual letters and documents. I found particularly poignant the telling of Mahler's last days at the NY Philharmonic and his troubles with its board's womens auxiliary and then, finally, his last trip home to Vienna and his death"
2,Not what I wanted,"I have been doing yoga for several years and have a friend I practice with regularly. We thought this video might help us get more stretch out of some of the poses. It really didn't help much. The video was a bit dull and a lot of the poses are more for couples who want to be touchy feely than two platonic friends wanting a good work out. If you want to touch just for the sake of touching, this is the video for you. If you want a challenging interesting yoga workout, then skip this one."
4,Amusing!,I was introduced to Inspector Coliandro when a local PBS station broadcast international mysteries via MHZ. Always loved this character and the trouble that he gets into and out of. I wish there were more of these delightful shows to watch.
1,A BOOK TO BE FORGOTTEN....,"If you never read anything about WW II air combat, this is not the book to start. If you have already read something about the subject, you will be angry with the low quality of this text, which is nothing more than a fable, a kind of diary thrown together with no kind of order, no sense of time and space, that you simply can't follow what is going on with the main character, theoretically the JG 26 pilot Gunther Bloemertz. The book is bad, really bad."
1,THROW IT AWAY NEXT STOP,"I'm an avid reader of fighter aviation combat books I can honestly say: this is the lowest I have gone into. I think i could have written such a book myself. WHy ? Because this book is tremenduosly vague, unconclusive, slow paced, data-missing, totally pointless. So pointless that the reader even don't feel sorry for the poor Luftwaffe pilot. Why ? Because he doesn't say who are his friends who are dying ! He doesn't say which is the unit of Luftwafe that's being decimated by the enemies... there's nothing here. It seems a drunk person was writing it."
2,"Good and funny, but lacks actual facts!","This book by Mr. Bloemertz has one characteristic the books about WW II written soon after the war generally have: it lacks research. The writer never ever say the complete name of the characters (his Squadron Leader, etc), only give us a few first names (like ""Robert"" ou ""Werner""). Even his Squadron number is not told to the reader.Not one single date of events is given in the entire book! The weakest point is when he says his friend Werner shot down a RAF Spitifire over France, and the pilot was captured, and he says he wore the Victoria Cross. Well, only one RAF fighter pilot won this decoration in WW II, and he was Flight Lieutnant James Nicholson in the Battle of Britain. And Nicholson never was shot down over France, nor been taken prisoner!!!"
1,The weakest book ever written by a Luftwaffe WW2 pilot,"Mr. Bloemertz writes in a boring style, adds almost nothing to the loyal reader of fighter-aviation books, and adds much less about his personal drama, because the characters are ""empty""... (when they have at least a name, which is very seldom!)About tactics and technical details, forget about it. They simply don't exist in this book."
1,"I regret ever buying this ""book'""!!!!","simply put, the worst air combat narrative I've ever read. It lacks facts, it lacks characters,... enough! Even remembering its flaws to write this review makes me angry!!!"
2,Seems to have lost its impact,"I first read this book in the 1960s. Somehow it does not read the same, but that could be memory. Whilst the book certainly gives a good idea of what Luftwaffe pilots under went during the war - no tours of duty, just keep flying and fighting -, the story lacks some detail and now seems almost banal. Pity, because the drama was there to be recorded."
3,Review of Jeannie C Riley,"Another case of 'one hit wonders.' ""Harper Valley PTA"" was the song that made her popular. But no follow-through. Still it is nice to hear the songs in digital format. And these songs, for better or worse, are no longer heard on 'oldies' stations. Perhaps the great female singers of this era should be on a compliation album. Nancy Sinatra ""Boots,"" Lynn Anderson ""Rose Garden,"" ""Harper Valley PTA"" and so forth."
4,Jeannie C. Riley Review,"A good overall play list of JCR's work. The big hit, Harper Valley PTA, started a little controversy when it was released and sounds very good in this CD. The emotions from this song are still present, as it was when first released."
1,Poor craftsmanship and quality,"I purchased 2 weeks ago and have worn 4 times roller blading. Last night the stitching let go, on the belt where it attatches to the pouch, and my new discman went sliding accross the pavement. Not what I consider value for $20.00 ...."
1,Broke in one day,"Got it yesterday, worked out with it this morning. It lasted minutes before the stitches tore and my CD player crashed to the floor. This should only be sold in a Joke Store: ""Laugh when your friend puts his valuable CD player in this joke pack and it breaks. Lots of yucks."""
4,Introducing Dolly Parton!,"For any Dolly fan, this is a no brainer. Who wouldn't want to hear the album that started the phenomonon? All the characteristcs that come to mind when I think of Dolly can be found here. Her honesty, down-to-earth sensibility, ability to touch your heart, playfulness and spirituality. Her voice is a bit higher than I'm used to hearing but her honesty shines through in spades. I love the playful ""I'll Oilwells Love You"" and ""Just Because I'm A Woman"". Though overall I must admit to liking her current material more.As a bonus, there is a live version of ""Just Because I'm A Woman"" included that was previously unreleased. Also previously unreleased, and included on this set, is the first ever recorded performance of a signature Dolly song ""Coat Of Many Colors"". What a treat!"
5,"I Mean, Why Did You Buy It?","Look, if you bought a Coffin Joe movie, you had to know what the hell it was all about and you have to like it just for the pure style involved.Then, add the fact that you own a subtitled horror movie and you can impress the hell out of anybody. Or scare the hell out of anybody, and you have the purchase price refunded right there.Great slices of film history, legendary until now, as they weren't exactly widely available on VHS, if they ever were on VHS.I'm gonna say one harsh thing about Coffin Joe movies...probably one is enough to appreciate what's going on. I may buy all three if the prices drop, but not before then."
4,"solid, waiting for more","I read this book four or five years ago when it came out and enjoyed it . . . my wife read it, too. If you like Anne Tyler, you'll like Agnes Rossi. She strikes a fun balance between character and plot. Here, it's two women from divergent backgrounds who learn about each other, shed some demons and get a better idea of all the pain they caused. Agnes Rossi, if you're out there, hope you're still writing."
5,Excellent Training and Subsequent Reference Material,"As a Systems Consultant and Educator for the past 21 years, with experience in Crystal Reports since version 1.0, I came upon Fastplanet's courseware for our Crystal Reports Training Courses. I do not need to tell you about the quality of their materials because I have the achievements of our students to prove it. Fastplanet's books are straight to the point, roll up your sleeves type materials which take you through the steps of becoming proficient at the use of Crystal Reports. Heavy on the practice side and with good coverage of the material. In short, you WILL learn Crystal with them."
2,I agree with everyone else...,"...that this release is okay but not great. Yes, it's nice to see bits of films that I haven't watched in a long time, but, as others here have pointed out, a very limited number of clips are included across the breadth of the whole series. How many times do we have to see the trailer for ""Predator""?!This set is an almost complete waste in the respect that it's aimed neither at fans of SF nor those curious about BECOMING fans of SF. The fan will find virtually nothing new here, and the proto-fan will find nothing interesting or intriguing.Chris Lee fans beware: Lee hosts but two of the 26 episodes in this set."
1,Century of Science Fiction,"Not what I was expecting.Many famous movies, TV series and characters not included in this compilation"
2,Century of Science Fiction,"This Video collection is good for Science Fiction Movie/DVD collectors and also great for reference and stock footage.There a several areas in this Science Fiction collection where information overlaps, so be prepared for some redundant clips.Also Christopher Lee only hosted a small section of these disc.These reference disc are good if your looking into the understanding of the fascination of Science Fiction films."
2,Tedious,"This was interesting for the first couple of episodes, then they just used the same clips from about 100 movies over and over again ad nauseum. Christopher Lee only hosts one episode, and thats a phone-in. If you are really interested in sci-fi and are looking for a decent overview I recommend you try something else."
3,"Laitner 10""bumpered wash brush with wooden handle???","Amazon labels this review as a brush with a metal handle, but I ordered a brush with a wooden handle and they show my order in my account as a wooden handle but I never got it and I give up. First I received a badly bent metal handle and after my feedback to them I ,maybe 10 days later, received a metal handle that was'nt bent. It works fine so I'll use it and shutup. First time I slip and scratch the car I will edit this review with some 4 letter words.The brush is SPECTACULAR!! It is very soft and would never hurt the cars finish and it makes the tires and wheels a breeze. This brush with a 6' handle w/ a bucket of soapy water works much better than my old cloth/bucket days."
5,Solid single,"While many singles are awful attempt at generic dance tunes, this one hardly goes that route. Instead, the original mixes and remixes on this album seem to be an attempt at taking the listener to another world. Much of the sound is somewhat dark and moody, but certainly not as dark as some of DM's more recent work. At times, it is hard NOT to listen.I wondered why ""Surrender"" was not a A side song. It would have fit in on their latest album. ""Headstar"" original mix was very good as well, typical DM sound with an edge of urgency. Overall, the single is very much worth the money."
4,An even better B-side,"This CD single is very good, no doubt about it. The song Surrender almost killed me, that's how good I think it is. Yet the title song isn't quite as good as the Ultra stuff, although it's not a bad song. The instrumental track isn't too bad, but instrumentals can't interest me too much, they never do. I need lyrics and voices. Surrender should have been the A-side, no doubt about it. I can't wait for a new album, which will hopefully be released before 2000...let's now hope the third world war will come a little later...what about never, than we'll have many more beautiful albums"
1,eeewwwhhh,"Well...What can I say...I love Depeche Mode!!! But I definately understand why this is not on the album!! I did not care for any of these singles on the CD. I tried my hardest to let myself catch on to it, to give it time as I have done with other albums such as SOFAD and Ultra but it just did not work! I mostly prefer DM older music however I have come to appreciate the last 2 albums VERY MUCH and they have become some of my favorite tunes!!! So to wrap this up, I was disappointed but will continue to enjoy their other VERY FINE work!!"
1,For a bank loan.,"This book of ""Get Fuzzy"" seems rather odd. When did we ever see the main characters end up in Vietnam? What we see are snippets of the cat as he goes through boot camp. His drill sergeant has a bad temper and is not affraid to take his aggressions out on poor old Bucky.After boot camp Bucky is reunited with his two other friends. This is where the author takes a tragic turn with the storyline. He tries to be funny in a Beatle Baily sort of way,but falls short. As a college student at Texas A and M I usually demand more from my cartoons, whether they be a political cartoon or not. Who are the people responsible for publishing this nonsense?"
1,Texas A+M,"Yes, I recieved a copy of the new Get Fuzzy, but then I try to stay on top of pop culture. I am a journalist major here at A+M, so I try to study all types of media in the newspaper. One thing I have not been able to comprehend is this copy of Get Fuzzy. Normally we see the characters just hanging out in their apartment, not much for a plot with just that, but that is all there is. This new book has put us in the killing fields of Vietnam. Is Conley trying to protest the war in Iraq? That is fine to protest the war, not very original, but his right nonetheless. My feeling is that if he wants to protest he should at least get his facts correct on Vietnam. Number one, it is not on the Australian Continent and number two they did not have cloaking devices like in Star Trek. If we wanted to see a protest novel we could have read ""War and Peace""."
5,Madness! Absolute Madness!,"Darby Conely's characters and their interactions are a work of comedy genius. It is impossible for me to read ""Get Fuzzy"" without howling with laughter. Bucky Cat is a lunatic. Although we have a general idea that he is a semi-violent egomaniac with a twisted perspective, his actions and passions are absolutely unpredictable. One can't help but love and feel for Satchel the Dog. He's sweet and loveable and not very bright. Rob the human is caught in the middle of the interplay between these two.I gave a copy of this and another of Darby Conley's ""Get Fuzzy"" collections to my mother when she was recovering from an operation to remove a cancerous tumor from her lung. She loved it; and it raised her spirit so much that it eased her recovery. Laughter is indeed the best medicine!"
4,Good Laugh,"these books just crack me up, my only complaint is they are too short! I never want to put them down, and read the whole thing in one sitting."
5,I love DARB,"HE'S A GUINESS!!! yOU'LL LOVE THIS BOOK IT ANSWERS LOT OF QUESTION LIKE ABOUT THE FERRET AND SATCHELS DIGITAL WATCH AND IT HAS A TOTALLY CUTE PIC OF BUCKY AS A KITTEN. PLUS IT HAS AWSOME COMICS ABOUT 9/11 YOU GOT TO BUY THIS IF YOU ARE A TRUE ""GET FUZZY"" FAN.:)"
2,Bootleged Get Fuzzy!,"I think that I can explain the Vietnam reference. There is a fraternity at Texas A+M University that has created a bootleged version of Get Fuzzy. The drawings are very accurate to Conley's. The irony is that the bootleged version is way more funny than the actual Get Fuzzy. The reason behind the bootleg is that the boys of that fraternity could not stand the ""cuteness"" of Get Fuzzy, you know how it has a tendency to be so, ""Oh how cute""? These frat boys felt that taking doses of Get Fuzzy is the same as having too much sugar. So one night on a drunken binge the bootleg Get Fuzzy was born. In my opinion the bootlegged version is way more funny, or even funny to begin with. So if you have a chance to read the bootleg read it, it is actually funny."
1,Bad Experience.,"In this new adventure of our three pals we see them stuck in the rice patties of Vietnam. Charlie has the drop on them and they try and get their way out. Satchel calls for help on the radio, Bucky goes nuts on his ""50"" while Rob tries to calm his boys down. I think Darby is trying to explore a new venue with this book, like trying to create a new ""Platoon"". Darby is way off on his history of the Vietnam War. An example of this is when he states that Vietnam took place in the 1950's. He should at least research before he writes. Also, the Americans did not fight along side the Germans in the Vietnam War. Usually Get Fuzzy is really bad, this book has made it worse."
2,"Great art, good set-ups, WEAK punchlines.",The payoff on these strips is really hollow. Conley thinks up these elaborate plot lines and then can;t deliver a gag. The art is great though.
1,don't be enticed by this stupid movie,"This is not a ""real"" emmanuelle film at all. it hasno erotic scenes. this has got to be one of the shoddiest and mostboring movies I've even watched."
1,A complete rip- off,"Please don't buy this DVD. The picture quality is one of an EP VHS. It says ""unrated, uncut"" edition...but there are actually no explicit sex scenes, In fact the sex scenes could be rated PG-13!!! There's topless nudity and that's it. This has nothing to do with the very sexy ""emmannuelle"" movies. Too bad because Laura Gemser was amazingly beautiful and I was looking forward to a sexy movie. Don't waste your money supporting the rip-off artists who made this DVD."
2,not the best,"As a massage therapist wanting to be able to do massage or facials on this table. I thought the table would be great. When I got the table, I noticed it was a very hard table definatly not a 3"" padding as stated and not as comfortable as other massage tables, it was also not as wide. I also had the same feed back from others. The cables also got in the way everytime I would try and put it away, it was very tricky to put away with out the cables getting in the way. I had decided it wasn't good enough for my clients and had to return it."
4,Gelatin Sheets are Great!,"I ordered these a few weeks ago to use in a recipe for white chocolate mousse. I've only ever used the sheets once before, in a week long pastry course I took, and I was nervous about using them at home. However, these were great! They were actually easier to use than the powder, in my opinion.The ordering process was easy and they shipped out promptly, as promised. The delivery actually arrived one day after the stated original delivery date, but I think that is the delivery services fault (UPS), not the seller. I would definitely order these from this seller again."
2,Pathetic,"This book is really DUMB!The characters in this book DO NOT act anything like the REAL Full House characters.First of all, no real school would allow a girl to bribe someone to vote for her.Second, how does Michelle just magically win the presidency?Third, Michelle shouldn't promise that the Ginger Girls will sing at their school if it isn't for sure yet. What if they turn out not being able to come?This book (and all of the other Full House Michelle & Full House Stephanie books) is just pathetic. Don't bother reading them."
2,Entertaining but unreliable,"The stories in this book are certainly interesting, and account for both stars. But the spin on them is overkill, and the argument behind them -- that we're over-regulated and over-governed -- is just plain unsubstantiated by the book. It's argument by anecdote: entertaining, but unreliable. And as another reviewer pointed out, some of the stories actually undercut this argument, though the author seems unaware of it."
5,Perfect for a doxy-loving vet tech,"So I have a dachshund that looks almost exactly like this. She is a diva to be sure and this pic does her and other diva doxies due justice. I should know, I meet them almost daily at the clinic. Easy transaction and fast shipping. Thank you!"
3,"Ok ,but if you want something good spend a buck more","This product, I thought, was fairly ok. it only has room for 1 roll of film and it doesnt have a lot of padding if it falls. But the perks are it has a cool sleek design to it but it's what's on the inside that counts."
5,This makes you feel great.,I have had back problems for years. A couple of minutes several times a day makes me feel great. I feel better and have less chronic back problems. This is a heavy duty table that is very easy to put together and folds for storage. You will be glad you have one.
4,good information - fast shipment - good packaging - no problems,good information - fast shipment - good packaging - no problems
4,Great but with one design flaw,This boxes were definitely well done except for one thing. If you need them for legal they are designed for letter. The plastic rods have to be cut in order to use them for legal files. It wasn't a big deal but I just wish I had known.
5,Really great swaddling blanket,"We have two favorite swaddle blankets in our house. This one is my husband's favorite because it is so soft and holds a swaddle very well. When I first saw these, I thought ""what a gimmick. We know how to swaddle a baby and know that you can use many types of blankets to do so."" True, but this one is perfectly suited in size and material and it's very pretty - nice for those snuggly newborn photos. (I slightly prefer theJJ Cole Swaddle Blanket - Blue Stripebecause it feels more substantial and cozy and our baby clearly loves the satin binding and the feel of the blanket material. It is also very attractive and coordinates with the JJ Cole's wonderful burp cloths, which are the absolute best. I am glad we have both.)"
4,Love the blanket - but too expensive,Just wanted a nice one for pictures - so I guess worth that. But for actual swaddling purposes found muslin ones at target stores which are 44x44 and you get 3/4 for the price of this + shipping!
5,This voice!,"Lina Mkrtchuyon has a fantastic voice which is excellent for this repertoire. An incredible reach, warm, natural. A must have for everyone who loves the classical song."
5,The Best Street Guide for Los Angeles,"In the age of internet many of us take it for granted that we can get street map of any part of the country in seconds free of cost, and buying a map is a waste of money. This is not true if you are talking about Greater Los Angeles area and if you have used the current Thomas Guide. We have been vacationing in Los Angeles area for years and we find this guide extremely helpful in navigating around the city. Los Angeles is known for very difficult traffic and the street system is complex compared to other cities in the country. The guide has comprehensive index that lists street addresses, beaches & harbors, cemeteries, schools and colleges, golf courses, hospitals, hotels, libraries, park & ride locations, parks, shopping centers, theaters and many other information you would be interested in. It is easy to use this guide; I strongly recommend this to anyone who drives around Los Angeles area, price is reasonable and it is good value money can buy."
3,Marketing at its worst...,"I can't really say that I'm upset, but I am disappointed that Syd's people saw fit to release a 'new' album that really only contains one new song. It's sad that the record label gods have decided that essentially a single track 'Bob Dylan Blues' should cost US$21.99.In summary, Bob Dylan Blues is an excellent song..."
3,A CD for new Barrett fans,"This Syd Barrett CD contains songs which can be found on his other, previously released CDs. The only new song is Bob Dylan Blues (which is a great song), but I see no point in getting this album for the sole purpose of hearing this one song. If you are a new to Syd Barrett, I reccomend purchasing this CD - it outlines Barrett's music and will give you a good overview of his lyrical skills. Otherwise, spend your money elsewhere."
5,great cd,This cd is a great one for collectors. It's worth the money just to hear Bob Dylan Blues. I can't get enough of that song.
2,He was a genius no doubt...But this is just so-so,"No one acknowledges the genius of Syd Barrett more than I do...Especially, on songs like ""See Emily Play"" and ""Arnold Layne.""Quite frankly though, if any Floyd/Barrett fanatic is truly honest with him or herself, this collection of solo material is average at best. Sure there are a couple of really great songs like ""Baby Lemonade,"" but most of the stuff just sounds like discarded demo tapes."
4,clark sandals,"Bought these to replace an older pair of clarks than I've for over ten years. Hope these last as long. They could be tad more comfortable, but they may need some breaking in. They are well constructed and easy to slip on and off.Herb."
2,unhappy with excessive wear,"I wore mine for half a year and have been very satisfied with general fit, comfort, and foot support. I am very unhappy with the excessive wear that they show compared to various other Clarks sandals I have owned. I have worn these for walking an average of 4 miles per day on paved streets and I will consider myself lucky if I get another two months before the sole wears through and breaks. The insole also shows excessive wear and tends to attract crud and dust that soak into its slightly textured surface."
2,Disappointing,"I bought these for my son's birthday, and unfortunately, the sizing didn't work as he usually wears an 11-1/2 and a 12 was too big and the 11 too small. The sandal has a back strap, which we thought would be great to get the perfect fit, but they just didn't and had to return. Unfortunately, the fullfillment company charges a restocking fee. Amazon was kind enough to give me a credit on my account since it wasn't clear in the description that returns would be penalized. We re-ordered the Ecco sandal from Amazon, and all was well. We realize sandals only come in full sizes, but the Clark just didn't cut it."
3,Taking control,"Cassie is funny. She has a nice way of describing people and places. As the story begins there are people around her, all of whom are unsatisfactory in some way. Over the course of the book Cassie comes to terms with her family and life through her coming to terms with her alcoholism. I really liked the fact that she made a new start without having to change where she was or the people who are most important to her. She is unashamedly optimistic in tone without being sickly sweet.Rock on Cassie!"
1,Highly Disappointed,"I read this book years ago and LOVED it. However, I was very disappointed by the Kindle version. The book ends abruptly leaving off a major portion of the end. I've written to Amazon hoping the Kindle edition can be fixed or my money returned so that I can buy the paperback and get the full version. I'm hoping it works out so that I'm not afraid to buy Kindle books in future."
4,A parable,"This is a book that changed my life. It is an entertaining, though painful, story, and manages to be quite funny at times. Cassie, the lead character, confronts her addiction, and actually changes. It is the first time I got the concept that someone could actually, really change. In reality, she may not have changed that much, but had been buried under addiction, and then her true self emerges. An inspiring book."
5,Just as good as I remembered!,If you love HP sauce (you probably wouldn't be looking at buying it in bulk unless you do) this is definitely the way to go. It tastes as good as it ever did and seems to keep without deteriorating at all (in a cool place but not necessarily refrigerated). My family loves it on many savory items (anything from breakfast eggs to burgers and steak) and we add it to bean dishes and homemade barbeque sauce too.Unreservedly 5 stars!Just wish we could buy Lea and Perrins Worchestershire sauce and Marmite in bulk too...
5,Substitution,"Was a little surprised to get two bottles of 2 litres but that was fine, as we ended with the same amount of product."
1,You must be kidding,"This book makes no sense. Great example of an opportunistic ""compiler"" marketing a bad idea to people who may not have access to the internet and certainly don't need access to this."
1,Time Wasted,"This book is great for older retired people who don't know how to use computer. For the rest of us, it's just the usual material off the net. Nothing to actually pay to read! I think its usefulness is very limited."
2,DON'T BE FOOLED,"I too found myself in Halfacre's class for a semester. I can attribute the beginnings of my love and knowledge for plants at this time. This is a great introductory book to the study of plants, a warning about this book. I have been practicing as a professional landscape architect for 6 years now and would never trust the information in this book. Landscape Plants of the Southeast is a great reference to get the memory going but when it come to selecting a material for a paying client I use Michael Dirr books. Many of the growth characteristics are wrong. For example, page 146, Schip Laurel is described a Sun or Shade. Full Sun for this Laurel WILL spell doom for the plant, this lack of research could cost you or a paying client thousands of dollars. The book is full of errors of this nature. It's a good intro book not a good research book, that's where Manual of Woody Landscape Plants come in."
5,Very interesting documentary,"There was a lot of repeating, so this must have been done for television originally, but other than that, it was really interesting, and we learned a lot that we did not know about Israels history. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who doesn't mind the bits of repetition"
5,Against All Odds,This was a fascinating series on the miracles of the forming of the modern state of Israel. I would suggest it for anyone who loves the Nation of Israel and her people.
5,Great documentaries,"These are great documentaries on miracles in Israel. Israel is the land God promised to the Jews around 3,000 years ago. These documentaries analyze the miracles that happened in Israel. For example, it talks about how Arab soldiers, who were fighting in the war to destroy Israel, yelled ""Ibrahim"" [Abraham] after they saw him appear in the sky. This is part of the evidence that God did help modern day Israel. In the second to last episode of these wonderful series, someone tells f how angels, who lit their swords, actually helped to protect Jews from Arab terrorists. The host of these series Michael Greenspan investigates miracles that have occurred in Israel. He talks to people, who experienced them. This documentary is a must see to anyone who wants to know God's role in helping Israel."
4,Touching love story,"I read this book back in college when a friend loaned it to me. It's a little simplistic, but what I liked best about it is that it's a love story set in an era (circa 1815) when the two lovers had to make their own way and define their relationship on their own, without the support of ""gay culture"".The author did a good job of conveying the ""make their own way"" bit; she could have done a better job at conveying a real sense of time and place. While the book was purported to take place in 1815 New York, it felt a little generic (as in ""a long time ago in America"").Still, though, the book is good enough to be memorable, as it's been 15-odd years since I read it."
4,A great little lesbian love story,"It's a classic. This book is a heartfelt and adorable story about two young women who are trying to make it as a couple in a time when women were not thought to be their own people. In a world where women belong to their fathers, brothers, or husbands, the radical notion that two women can fall in love and make it work was unheard of. I recommend this story to anyone who wants to read a sweet and endearing love story."
3,An against all odds love story.,"I did not like the writing format of the book. It was set to far back in the 19th century.Superb job in displaying the shape of each character and their personality. An against all odds love story. A mediocre ride though as far as the storyline.A regular read. Characters were OK but they may not be able to stand on their own. Storyline was So,So. A straight line with no emotions are any thrills."
4,You could feel the passion,A touching story of two women who fall in love and defy their families and society to be together. Nothing vulgar or obscene. The author did a wonderful job of portraying the genuine love these two women felt for eachother despite very different upbringings. A quick and enjoyable read.
5,I Love It!,"This book was lent to me by my first girlfriend, in college, and from the first word to the last, it is definitely one of the best books that i have ever read. It has everything-- humour, romance, sincerity, strength, and even though it was to have taken place a long time ago, it is very real and very true, even today...definitely worth it!"
3,Hard to understand this.,"It really is hard to understand either of these recordings. I realize they were released on vinyl many years ago, but I didn't understand them at that time either. I know that Beach Boys Party was a stop-gap effort that Brian came up with to appease Capitol Records while he had time to work on more important stuff, but Stack O' Tracks really escapes me.It's widely known by any Beach Boys fan that the Beach Boys rarely played on the albums. They were mainly a vocal group. So when you listen to Stack O' Tracks, you're not hearing the Beach Boys, you're hearing session musicians. Why is this important?"
5,Sensational Fun,"Looooooooooooooooooooooove it! Such a fun album!!! I feel so good listening it! Free-style beautiful 60s harmonies, great acoustic strumming, love the party-like background chatter. Really was the first unplugged album, except it was fun, not all serious. This is a ""party"" album. It's meant for fun. This is not the outstanding album Pet Sounds. This is the have-a-good-time Party album. I think of good times and 60s southern california even though I wasn't even born yet.Stack-O-Tracks has to be one of the first karaoke albums. Just instrumentals and I have a much greater appreciation for the breadth of musicianship either by the beach boys or the session musicians of the time who were abundant and outstanding at the same time. In fact some songs I prefer the instrumental to the actual songs."
4,Party,Good CD. Not my favorite Beach Boy album but still good packaging and some good tunes on it. Stack o tracks is good to listen to every once in a while to hear the greatness even behind the vocals!
2,Bad Deal,"The second CD in this set, Stack O Tracks was suppoed to come with a songbook. It didn't and doesn't. Capitol no longer has them. Essentially you're getting the instrumental versions. The first CD in the set is confusing. I don't know who to believe, Amazon, the Rolling Stone, any number of books about the Beach Boys. Half say it is a true live album and the other half say the laughter and background noise was added in later. Which is it?"
4,Good stuff,"First-hand account from the ex-Runaways singer about the highs and lows of stardom, LA-style, at an early age. Cherie Currie packed a lot of living in a few years while fronting the all-girl group, and this is a vivid recounting of how she and her fellow Runaways made it sorta big in the mid to late 1970s (I'd say at best they were a band with a big cult following that fell JUST a bit short of making it big-time). Also displays the sleazier side of fame, with plenty of unsavory characters in the Hollywood nightlife ready to exploit Currie (who, sadly, was more often than not a witting participant in her own drug-addled decline). Clearly written, highly descriptive and very concise, this book is an effective, cautionary tale. Nice work."
3,errors,"An interesting book and at first looks very exciting. But I had trouble finding the answers to the posed questionsAlso on page 63 the author describes the ""Amp"" as a coulomb multiplied by a second when in reality the Amp is a coulomb divided by a secondI am pretty sure that is true and I have not misread the page"
3,WHATS UP WITH THE ANSWERS?,"I REALLY LIKE THIS BOOK BUT SOME THINGS JUST DON'T MAKE SENSE LIKE:1. THE LAYOUT OF THE ANSWERS BEHIND THE BOOK ARE REALLY CONFUSING AND NOT IN ORDER2. GRAMMATICAL ERRORS3. SOME IDEAS ARE NOT EXPRESSED USING THE MOST APPROPRIATE TECHNICAL JARGONI STILL LIKE THE BOOK AFTER ALL I BOUGHT IT. IT DID HELP IN OPENING MY MIND TO SOME IDEAS, IT HAS LOTS OF EXAMPLES THAT ARE WELL EXPLAINED MOST OF THE TIME AND IS REALLY AND OK INTRODUCTORY TEXT....BUT THE ""ANSWERS BEHIND THE BOOK"" ISSUE...NOT GONNA FLY WITH ME"
1,Wrong product,When I ordered this product it was supposed to fit a certain model Hunter air purifier but it didn't either the web page was wrong or the order was screwed up.
3,"Allergy BeGone Feedback - negative, filter is fine","It seems that you cannot update your Amazon Seller Feedback once entered, so I'll leave it here. I ordered this product from allergybeGone and it arrived promptly, however the packaging was so poor the pre-filter's metal frame was broken in multiple spots. Customer service was very responsive in offering me a refund, I however wanted a filter so I waited for them to restock and reship the filter. They assured me it would be packaged properly. When the filter arrived about 3 weeks later it was packaged in the exact same fashion as the first. While not broken the frame and metal filter have multiple bends and dents. This one will fit in the unit so I'll keep it- but I will not order pre-filters from Allergybegone again.The filter appears like the original hunter but I can't know for sure."
5,Nice replacement filter,I'm very happy with this replacement pre filter. My old one basically felt apart from all the use/washigns over a few years. It fits the Hunter air purifier well. I found the price to be better then on the other websites.
1,Incorrect Pre-Filter,"I ordered the pre-filter for a Hunter model 30200 but the pre-filter I received doesn't fit. I'm trying to work with the company that shipped the filter, but no luck so far."
5,Very nice product for an extremely good price,Very nice gauge set and very easy to install. Lights up well at night and look great with the white background and the chrome surrounding it. I am going to buy another set for my other classic hot rod because I like the gauges so much. Sure beats paying the price of some of the other gauges that I have seen on the market. These work great.
5,Looks and work great!,These gauges are worth every penny. They look great and are very stylish. You cannot go wrong with these gauges if you like mechanical and not electric. I love the white face.Alan
5,LOVE this stuff,"Yes the rolls are too short for the price BUT this stuff is just the best for holding things together. Use it on my yoga mats/rugs, the spare handle lengths of our roof rake, keeps my King size sheet sets together & in order in the linen closet -- also works on electrical cords, vacuum cleaner cords & parts,hanging tools up in the garage, holding lawn hoses together for winter storage!! I'm sure I'll come up with more uses as the January re-organization frenzy continues -- may sound odd but if you know someone who likes to organize stuff-- this would be an excellent gift. (--:"
5,Great tool for organizing cords,Great tool for organizing cords. We needed to move computer cords away from reach for our new puppy. The one wrap worked well because we could cut any length needed. Many of the cord organizers are pre-cut and will not fit around thicker cords. Wish it came in longer rolls.
5,works well to secure rolled up blinds,I have three sets of roll up blinds on my porch. I use the velcro to secure the blinds when they are rolled up.This takes the pressure off the locking cord and should add longer life to the cord. It's simple and works well. Glad I bought it.
2,Mr. Rogers Neighborhood Meets New Age,"I love ethereal, ambient, healing New Age. I have at least 250 CDs of this genre in my collection. This will not be #251. Do you remember the electronic piano/casio electric keyboard sound of Mr. Roger's Neighborhood? It is in most of the songs on this album. The few songs that don't have this are decent, but if you want truly healing, contemplative music, try Liquid Mind, Anugama, Raphael or others like them."
5,Easy Listening,Purchased as a gift and that person said they really enjoyed it! I also really love that you have samples to listen to online!!! That allowed me to choose the right one for a gift!
2,Almost got it right.,"For the reader with military experience, this book is a tough read. The concept was good-tracking an NCO through his career from Viet Nam to Iraq- was right on the money. However, Stroud could have benefitted from an editor with military experience. There were so many technical errors, the storyline often gets lost. Wannabes will like like it. Soldiers won't."
1,only a couple of songs for the movie,very disappointing I loves the songs from the movie I did not enjoy the other artists. I would not buy this again I would just download the songs that I liked from the movie.
3,Read list of songs carefully.,"The packaging says it is the original soundtrack, but it does not include the John Mayer track. Did not realize it. Should have paid more to the list of songs before I purchased it. Disappointed."
2,???????????????,"I purchased this by mistake, but the music make no sense to have after watching the movie."
5,Great Metal Cd!!!,Apophis is a very good death metal group. This is everything you would expect in a death metal group. Every song on this cd is good. The other guy that wrote a review about this cd being to hardcore lol what a joke. Why would you buy a death metal cd if your not looking for hardcore and heavy metal? I highly recommend this cd to anyone that likes death metal.Keep up the good work Apophis!!!
2,The Story of the Lafayette Escadrille Told by...Capt. Georges Thenault,"I was anticipating a book oriented towards an operational history of the Escadrille's 20 months. While not ignoring such, the focus is more towards their life on the ground, the beauty of France & the Rhine valley, and hotels & restaurants (sic).The publishers OCR software misreads, and loses, both letters and words [Soiiime = Somme, but what is ""MSintEUGSHMS. ItffllwS r f IJ I kmlik""?] There are also no pictures or maps, the software again.p, but the captions are in the text.32 pcs of paper and a generic cover, plus the above, don't, in my opinion, merit the $13.78 price."
5,Don't use FrontPage without this book!,"I've got all the huge books about FrontPage, but this is the one I keep coming back to for quick, easy information and answers. I did get my page up in a weekend, but I'm still using the book to expand and refine it. Now if he'd just write one for Photoshop.."
2,Forged in the Fire- ??,My husband purchased this book for his men's Bible study group. They were about 3 weeks in and it was brought to the attention of the group that the author seemed to be taking unnecessary liberties with the Bible and how it related to what they were studying. They chose to look into getting a new study.
4,A Very Good Toyah,"Why am I not giving this album five stars? The song quality on Anthem ranges from the brilliant ""Jungles of Jupiter"" to the power pop hits ""I Want to be Free"" and ""It's a Mystery"" to the uneven/bizarre ""Pop Star"" and ""Elocution Lesson"". The album extras have some interest, particularly ""Angels and Demons"" and perhaps ""Alien"". Overall, the songs on Anthem don't match those on The Changeling and don't have the power of The Blue Meaning.Of course, if you like Toyah, you must own this album, too. Anthem just sounds like Toyah had run out of her best ideas; so I'd purchase The Changeling and The Blue Meaning (if you can find a copy) first, then Anthem. Toyah's Love Is The Law is also worth seeking out."
5,Dorman upper control arm (Driver side) for My 1997 Ford Expedition 4wd 5.4L V8,"Since I'm an Auto Mechanic, I've been searching to find an affordable price for an upper control arm for my Expedition. I shopped around at Auto Zone, NAPA, O'Reilly Auto Parts and many other online website. The prices were between $65-$90 each!! Way too expensive for me, so I decided to go on Amazon.com to find out if they would offer a cheaper price on a replacement part that I need for my truck. Surprisingly they did!!! $31.87 with free-shipping!!! A few days later, my package arrived and the product looked very well-built, strong, and tough. I installed it in less than 25 minutes and drove it around town for an hour. Now my truck has a much better steering response while cornering on and off-road. Great product for an Excellent Price!!!!Thank you Amazon"
1,"Far too fragile for ""on the go""","We bought this from REI before a backpacking trip, thinking it would be so much easier than packing a bottle plus bowl for our spaniel. Wrong! The plastic hinge broke the first night after a really minor tip-over on a rock. It broke on its own impact, which rendered the bottle completely useless. It won't open its water valve if the hinge doesn't work, so we had to unscrew it every time our dog wanted a drink. Massive pain, and a little too expensive for a one-time use. Buy a bowl."
1,Horrible belt clip,"This product is good in theory but the belt clip was worthless. I bought one of these and put it on my belt and it fell off about five feet from the car, and it cracked so I couldn't clip it back on. I had to carry it on my twelve mile hike so my dog could have some water. I would buy the other product like this that comes with a strap."
5,put it on dvd!!,Why hasn't this been issued on dvd yet? This is one of the most informative documents of music history! Release it on DVD already!
4,Friendly Vision,"After the sessions for Smile caused Brian Wilson to suffer a breakdown, the rest of the band forged on in his absence. Their first release was Wild Honey was an unexpected, R&B influenced gem. The follow up to Wild Honey was Friends. It takes a turn towards a more earthy, folky sound. It hits in spots like the title track, ""When A Man Needs A Woman"" and ""Little Bird"". But Mike Love's influence clouds some tracks especially the dopey ""Transcendental Meditation"". After the disappointing Friends album, the band bounced back strong on 20-20. The album gets back to a more classic Beach Boys sound and the sound they mined on Wild Honey. ""Do It Again"" is a song that harkens back to their fun in the sun, beach days and is a great song. ""I Can Hear Music"" contains their trademark harmonies and is a pretty song. The album is strong from start to finish including excellent tracks like ""All I Want To Do"", ""I Went To Sleep"", ""Our Prayer"" and ""Be With Me""."
3,"nice, but not mandatory","i'll have to agree with most of the reviewers that friends is indeed the beach boys most relaxed record. and it does have a great feel to it. that said, its not really all that. the mood is more memorable than the songs, which range from great (busy doin nothin (ranks alongside of dock of the bay as best of the i've-got-nothin-to say-but-i'll-write-a-song-anyway songs), be here in the morning, meant for you, friends) to pretty good (be still, wake the world) to dispensible (transcendental meditation, anna lee, little bird). 20/20 is much more piecemeal, with the keepers being i can hear music, our prayer, cabinessence. anything with mike love & especially al jardine is fairly useless, and never learn not to love is more intersting as a charles manson song than beach boys song. this cd is nice to have, but has alot of filler."
1,suckfest,"I love the early beachboys....but then they tried to be hip in the 70's and couldnt do it except for sail on sailor (great song)....this album SUCKS ...SMILE is terrible, dont waste your money."
3,Brian goes boss-nova for one brief shining moment,"I agree with Anthony Nasti that BUSY DOIN NOTHIN is the most astonishing track. Just for the lyric alone. Which is a masterpiece of intentional banality. It's just a tedious run-on description of trivial everyday crap. Plus the extra bonus of road directions to Brian's house. Lyric-wise, the high point is Brian's spoken-word delivery of ""I'll think I'll make a call"". It's achingly brilliant."
3,Two enjoyable albums...they don't all have to be classics,"The Beach Boys/ Friends / 20-20 (two albums on one CD with bonus tracks): This CD (with both of these albums) is enjoyable. They are not classics but they certainly are NOT horrible. These are subdued, introspective albums and as such, they are a pleasure to hear. These are not essential recordings but there is nothing wrong with light entertainment. Amazon defines the 3-star rating as ""It's ok"", and that is exactly how I feel about this CD...It's ok."
4,"Terrific Tunes, Familiar and Unfamiliar","I first heard Friends over 30 years ago. There is something very special about it:Is it:the gentle introduction song ""Meant For You?""the unusual harmonies in the triple time title track?the interesting string/tuba arrangement of ""Wake the World?""the geographical directions in Busy Doin' Nothin'?or is itthe satisfying progression of songs?Whatever the reason is, it is one of The Beach Boys very best albums.But this CD also includes 20/20 which may not be as great as an album, but it includes terrific songs likeDo It AgainI Can Hear MusicThe album also has 2 fabulous instrumentals:""Passing By"" and ""The Nearest Faraway Place""as well as some extras which were not on the original album, such as the hit song ""Breakaway.""This version, unlike my older copy is digitally remastered.AND you get a booklet with perceptive liner notes on each song.Highly recommended"
4,Picking Up the Pieces,"Friends has any number of high points--the title track, ""Be Still,"" Brian Wilson's astonishingly gorgeous ""Busy Doin' Nothin'""--but is dragged down by too much weak material. 20/20, however, though a collection of singles, unreleased tracks, and the odd Smile leftover, is terrific. Brian Wilson contributes some crucial tracks, including the romantic ""Time To Get Alone,"" the nostalgic ""Do It Again,"" plus the Smile leftovers ""Our Prayer"" and ""Cabinessence."" Plus, 20/20 really rocks. It also benefits from some great Dennis Wilson compositions. This 2-fer CD set has great bonus songs: ""Break Away,"" the Boys' brilliant last Capitol single; ""We're Together Again,"" and a fragmentary cover of ""Walk On By"" that makes you wish they'd covered more Burt Bacharach. Very worth acquiring."
4,Classics reconsidered,"I'm thrilled about this new reissue series. The upgraded sound is breathtaking. You'll hear details you never knew existed. The music on these two albums remains great by any other standard, but mixed bag if judged against records like ""The Beach Boys Today"" ""Pet Sounds"" or even ""Smiley Smile"". ""Friends"" is a warm, gentle album. It contains some of the best singing the group ever did. The lovely ""Anna Lee, The Healer"", the simply ecstatic and momentary ""Meant for you""--- classic stuff. ""20/20"" has some moments of its own: the near-perfect ""I can hear music"", the weird ""Cabinessence""--- all in all, two great, under-appreciated works by a band that would be forever (unfairly and harshly) be judged against thier own moment of cosmic genius, ""Pet Sounds""."
4,Hot and Funky Samba Pagode styled Dance Jam,"Trio Mocoto brings it funky with classic bass lines identifiable by most funk enthusiasts, blended with light classical Bossa Nova melodies, undertowed with strong Pagode flow, skillfully never loosing a beat; making DANCE devotees eager to take the next step to the rhythms of this excitingly mastered CD. Beleza, Beleza, Beleza is a definite intergenerational blend of the old made newer and even better.A definite get up off of your feet, and mexe mexe party CD; great Samba dance class warmer! We love it in Oakland, CALI~califa510"
3,Disappointed,"I bought this book based on reading the back cover comment by one of my favorite authors, R.C. Sproul Jr., but I was disappointed. I would describe the book as dry, with few insights. The last chapter was better, but that was not enough. However, if you are considering buying this book, my suggestion is to put more weight on R.C. Sproul's comment than on my two cents worth."
4,OT History with a difference,"Leithart has a Cambridge Ph.D., is a Presbyterian pastor (PCA), and about the smartest guy on earth.Wonderful book, but its mislabeled as an OT Intro. Its more an OT history. There is very little on the wisdom literature in there. It is a briilliant redemptive-historical tour. The typology gets kind of heavy and at times forced. But brilliantly draws parallels between various OT stories and convincingly illustrates how the original reader would have made the same connections.This should not be your OT Intro textbook (use R.K. Harrison or Longman/Dillard for that). But really fun and compelling stuff.The binding by Canon Press softcover is attractive enough, but not very durable (glued but not sewn). I own 3 or 4 copies, and I have had pages fall out after just one use."
4,Good Insight,"This book has some really good insight on the imagery of the Old Testament -- ""shadows"" of things to come, but the substance belongs to Christ. I found some of his parallels to be a little stretched, but his summaries of the stories are excellent and many of his illustrations are helpful."
4,mikes at his best,"A great master of humour, George Mikes has done incredibly well in this book. This parody of English humour is absolutely hilarious; we can find in this little gem of a book the best of Mikes's patented ironic humour. I would say this is definitely vintage Mikes: thoughtful, provocative and very, very funny."
4,good price!,"As a office manager, I try to save when ever I can and i check amazon.com when i need office items. The items i have found and bought I have been evry pleased. They have been delivered in great condition and sooner then they were supposed to be here.Thanks amazon.com!"
1,idiots!,"Speroni and Golino was a superb text for a student! I was able to teach myself Italian with it with zero problems, although it is designed for a classroom setting (e.g., there's no self-study exercises with answers at the back).However, that was with the 6th edition -- a superlative text.However, somebody -- and I know not who -- completely overhauled the text for the seventh edition, which is I think the edition this review will appear on. The exercises were changed, the pictures were changed, the explanations were changed.Having known the 6th intimately, I found the changes confusing, worse, and off-putting. Using the 7th to teach others, I was repeatedly dumbstruck at the decisions they had made. Was it because of these idiotic changes that this text now seems out of print?In sum, I heartily recommend this, but only the 6th edition and before. Note, though, that even the 7th edition only came with audio cassettes, not CDs."
3,"Not My Cup of Tea, But Did the Job","Being required for my Italian I course, I did not enjoy the book that much. It was quite thick, packed with extremely small text, and did not heighten my interest at all. I felt I was reading a medical journal - in Italian. Wanting to learn the language, the book did nothing to increase my interest.However, flawed as it was, the book included an adequate array of learning material, and I did succeed in completing course with the book, and learning about the Italian language, albeit not in the way I would have necessarily liked."
2,Italian Headings,"This book is a very expensive book. $96.95 for a book with only 443 pages. It is not worth the price. Also in each chapter there are words in Italian as a heading without the English word. If you look them up in the Italian-English Vocabulary at the end of the book they are not listed. Why would someone write a book on a foreign language and not explain the meaning of the phrases in English. Examples are Domande, Esercizi, Come si dice, etc. This book needs improved."
1,title is mislabled -- is not a soundtrack!,Should have read the reviews...The title is a lie.It isn't a soundtrack.
4,Excellent,"Full of suspense--who done it, but yet was touching and romantic. I enjoyed it immensely and recommend it highly. The Cowboys series is proving to be a lesson in family values that follows one and come full circle because real family brings you home.."
3,"Good series, but not great","After reading the first 2 books in this series I was all set to write a rant about how bad it was. But the 3rd book changed my mind.I still feel that the writing was kind of amateurish and stilted, but I grew to like the characters. Many times I had to re read the last paragraph just to figure out what was going on. Scenes were a bit disjointed. But like I said, I grew to like the characters a lot. So, for that fact I am giving this a rating of 3 stars instead of the 1 star I initially was going to leave.The plots for this series are very basic and very transparent. In all 3 books I figured out the endings before I was half way through them. But, if you like a fast paced space opera, then go ahead and read this series. It is not unenjoyably, it is just plain and very basic.I am a huge fan of S.M Stirling's books, and I will read anything he releases."
5,I can't wait for #4----,"I am enjoying this series very much. I held off at first thinking that it was trying to just build on Mr. Doohan's reputation and that it was a ""trekkie"" book. I was so wrong. It is a series all of its own and a good one, at that. Try it, you'll like it!!! BUT--begin with #1 and proceed in order. Much better idea."
1,A good read,I read all three of the books in this series and really wanted to see more. its best to read them in order or a lot of thiongs might not makes so much sense.
5,Love the concept of this movie,I really love this movie. It is a bit strange but I love the concept of it. I'm glad I made the purchase. :)
3,A beautiful but confusing love story.,"This movie is ok to watch if you're trying score points with your girl but by yourself this movie is a love story plain and simple. There's action (mostly cgi), there's some comedy but still its a love story plus this movie shows too many flashbacks! You'll be confused after the first 45 minutes! The movie is only good to watch if you're with a loved one but if your with a friend skip it unless you have respect for Korean movies! Only under that logic watch it."
1,One of the bad Korean Fantasy movies. The fighting is worthless. The plot is incoherent and nonsense.,"It's one of the bad Korean Fantasy movies. The fighting is worthless. The plot is incoherent and nonsense.I prefer the Warrior, and Shadowless Sword."
3,sEverything went well,Had a problem but it was taken care of quickly and respectfully. I liked that the fact when I had a problem with it she was willing to work with me and make sure that I was satisfied.
5,Very good purchase,My cousin played it and he loved it and he played for 3 years before switching to psp.Very portable and simple and kids loved it.
4,Affordable Fun,"It's less expensive than the new DS. But the best part is the savings on games. We can buy our games used at local stores for $10 - $15. Lots of games are readily available, and it runs Gameboy and Gameboy Color games too. Not the latest technology, but still a lot of fun value. Screen on this GBA SP is nice and bright."
5,Excellent,Came in Excellent form. It is good for kids to play with the bright backlight. Excellent!!!
4,Why not buy a DS?,Why would you buy this now? It was really cool a couple of years ago but you should buy a Nintendo DS. It will play all the GBA games plus the DS games for only a little bit more. They've already stopped making games for this system. After Christmas I highly doubt they'll even have games available anymore. Get a DS. Just trying to be a buddy and help.
5,Good value,"My son dropped and broke his Game Boy Advance SP. He wanted the exact same color, the Pearl Blue. I told him I would replace it and got on Amazon.com. I was surprised to see how much brand new ones cost, so I decided to get him a used one. I bought him one that was listed as ""collectible"". He had it within 10 days. It was described as being in good shape with a few scratches on the outside, and no marks on the screen. It arrived exactly as described and he was very happy!! And so was I!! It works perfectly. If you don't mind a few marks on the outside, this is the way to go!"
5,Excellent Game,"The game came way before I was expecting it, and it was exactly what I was looking for! It was to be a gift to my nephew for his birthday, and he has not put it down yet!"
4,Small but easy to handle.,This Game Boy Advance is small so you can take it anywhere you want to go. The screen is large enough for detailed graphics. There are more than enough games for you to choose to purchase seperately for this game.
1,Not for seniors,"I wanted a simple 'puzzle' handheld game that didn't involve rapid finger and thumb movement because I'm simply too old for kid's games. This is a kid's game and nothing I read in advance prepared me for that. Apparently all the reviews are written by youngsters who love to wail at the keys before losing to a relentless clock. The game console (used) arrived in excellent condition but it was just a shell. NO included games, NO instructions. I ordered two games (Tetris, Mario Bros) which also came without instructions. Eventually I figured out what was needed but, again, not what I wanted. I've asked the kids selling Wii, PS2 & 3, etc., and none seemed to understand I wanted puzzle or adventure games - NOT action games requiring manual dexterity, so they didn't know what I should buy. I'm afraid the days of King's Quest and Liesure Suit Larry are gone forever, or at least anyone that knows about such things are nowhere to be found. Guess I'll go watch some TV..."
3,"Ummm, it came out too late!",Here it comes. I love nintendo and their systems. But these colors are coming out too late! By the time they come out they come out everyone has one and no one wants one. Lats year before pearl blue came out. There was a Japanese girl in our class and she had a pearl blue color sp. Conclusion- nintendo is great but their colors come out late and Japan might be a little too friendly with Nintendo.
1,How Can Anyone Possible Play This?,"Okay, the screen of Game Boy Advance is way too small. I don't what Nintendo was thinking when they came up with this. You might as well use a little cell phone to play games. If you want to lose your eyesight, go ahead and get this system. After a year, you will be wearing glasses like Urkel. Or if you currently wearing glasses, your eyesight will only get worse. The screen only show ants."
4,Have Fun whileTraveling,"It is really a good way for keeping kids notthinking about ""Are We There Yet"" once they get busy with it they don't bother you as much as they used to."
5,Fun!,"I share an SP with my little brother and it rocks, I am planning to get another one for my self. The graphics and sound are both great! Another great thing about it is that it plays GBA games and GB games. I also like the built in backlit light. It also comes in a variety of colors. This is a must for someone who wants a handheld game system.Graphics: ASound : A+Light B+Portability: A"
4,my daughter loves it!,My daughter is 7 and she loves her new gameboy. It is easy for her to handle and the screen is very clear. My younger daughter already wants one and she is only 2.
4,Just what I expected,"I have purchased this game for my son 7th birthday and it is great, he enjoys playing with it. I would recomend this game to parents for their children.The only problem I had is that the package took more time than expected but otherwise its great.l"
4,my son loves it,"My 6 yr old son waited a couple of months to get it for his 6th birthday and when he got it, he loved it. He has been playing it a lot and still likes it."
3,"Limited game choice for novice players, headphones require extra adapter","I have limited exposure to this device. We bought it and tested it with a game, we then decided not to give it to our son.We found out that most of the currently available games are quite demanding. I think a high IQ 8 - 10 yo, or an average IQ 1-14 yo would be alright with this device and the available games, but otherwise I'd be very cautious about this purchase.There used to be games sold for the 6-8 yo range, but most of those are no longer available. Before you buy this game, carefully consider whether your child would enjoy it or be frustrated by it.One other thing is astoundingly annoying. If you want a child to listen with headphones (the sounds are insanity provoking) you need to buy a separate adapter. This is clearly a cheap ploy to extract additional revenue."
3,"Game Boy just as described, but game doesn't work","The Game Boy itself arrived safe and sound and exactly as described. However, it came with a game cartridge (emerald) which does not work. We tried it another Game Boy and it didn't work there either. Then we inserted a game we already owned into the Game Boy we had just purchased and it worked perfectly. The Game Boy was the most important thing, but my daughter was disappointed that the enclosed game did not work."
2,where is it?,"this is so small that it is ridiculous...there should also be an age group stated on the box,the games that they offer are for younger children,but you have to know how to read to play them .. that should be noted somewhere"
5,Improvement over original SP,"I bought this pink gameboy advance SP for my daughter, who loves pink. Her older brother, who normally would rather be caught dead than with something pink, actually traded gameboys with his sister because the ""lighting and screen are so much better"" on this version of the SP. It must be a heck of an improvement -- he doesn't even hesitate to carry it around in public despite the color!"
5,Love this little system,"Plays Gameboy, GB Color, and GB advance games with the special backlit display. Even throws in a little color on the original gamebot games."
4,A Very Cute Color for the SP,"The Game Boy Advance SP, especially the Pearl Pink and Pearl Blue versions, as well as the improved black one, have much brighter screens than the original models, making it much easier to see. Instead of a dull pinkish color, now reds are truly displayed as reds.The Pearl Pink color is very pleasant. It's a rather soft color.The only thing that could make this handheld unit any better is a headphone port, but aside from this, if you want to play your old Game Boy games or Game Boy Advance cartridges, you can't go wrong!"
4,Revo 3050,"Like the other metal framed Revo's I've had, they're more on the heavy side, but I can deal with that because it makes them more durable.These fit well and are comfortable, but I was expecting the same type of blue lenses I had in my last pair. I bought them for driving, and the last pair where the best pair I ever owned. These are polarized and not bad, but I was expecting the same lenses I had in my last pair as they appeared to be the same in the picture and description, but weren't. (That's really my fault and not a negative reflection on the seller). I suppose next time I'll head to the store before I purchase to see first hand what I'm actually buying online."
5,Awesome a true crooner!!!!,"Not only does the cover look awesome the band does too!!! A true Blue story for any RANCID fan,or for any punk fan to check out!!! You won't be dissapointed!!! It rocked my sox and it will rock yours too!!! Enjoy!!!"
4,davez,These helper springs work great on my sportrac. I pull a pop up camper and these keep my truck from squatting when I hook up the camper.
4,Very Functional!,"I used these on a classic car to help stiffen some tired leaf springs. They worked very well. These overloads restored ride height and the car no longer sags when something is placed in the trunk. Handling also improved. They come with rivets to allow you to have more or less lift, and if you want to keep your ride height close to stock, you can always not use to extra rivets and install this product without lifting the car fully off the ground. I have had them installed for several months without any sagging or other issues.Cons: The paint on these seems cheap and some was flaking off before I installed them, so I recommend sanding and repainting them if you are concerned about appearance. Please note, If you have never done anything automotive related, I recommend caution when installing this product, be safe and follow instructions. Improper installation could result in damage to yourself or your property."
5,Helper Springs,I was very impressed by the price and performance of this product. It went on a 45 year old vehicle which does not have a huge following of aftermarket support. My intention was to get a few inches of lift for the sagging factory springs. This product did just that. The ride is not harsh. It just did as it was supposed to and helped the stock springs. I can now put more weight in the vehicle without fear of the suspension bottoming out. Handling was also improved due to more rigidity.
4,Pond De-Icer,I'm very glad I ordered this. It appears to work wonderfully. My fish seem to worship it!!! They are glued to it. It was nice to be able to leave them in the pond this winter. Last year I took them out and put them in a fishtank that was a bit too small. I ended up losing more than half of them. Live and learn. This year they grew too big to be taken out and multiplied!!! Looking forward to spring.
1,Shorts out,Mine also lastest one season. When I put it in the pond this year it shorted out my entire electrical system. What a waste of money. I would have expected more from Tetra. I hope my fish do not freeze while I a new heater.
3,Shorts out and trips GFI,I had my pond guru install this last season. It lasted about 3 months then kept shorting out. It has a 3 year warranty I am hoping they will honor it.
2,Kissed off after one season,Worked fine last year. Put it in now nada. Should have lasted more than one season.
5,Excellent small de-icer,I like this de-icer (I have two for my large koi pond) primarily because it looks more 'natural' in winter than the typical donut shaped de-icers. It does a good job of keeping a requisite opening in the ice for air exchange.
2,Do any of these last?,"I had one of these that I did not order on Amazon, but bought at a local garden shop. It lasted 2 1/2 seasons. I know we used it last year and the year before (replaced another heater that had failed after about three years). It was working fine since this fall, but we noticed in January that it had quit.I realize this is something that is in water, and in freezing temperatures, which is stressful for any machinery, but goodness, that's what's it's made for! I really wish these things would last a few years longer. Now I have to replace it again, or keep going out to break holes in the ice. And I have to add to the waste stream by disposing of it."
1,Non-functioning pond de-icer,"I was very pleased to find this cleverly designed pond-deicer on Amazon. We installed it in the late fall, before the temperatures had dropped. So it was sitting there for a while before we knew whether or not it would work. When the temperatures finally did drop, the thermostat failed to kick in -- tried unplugging and replugging, checked circuit breaker. It simply didn't work. We returned it for a credit. Don't buy this product."
4,Pleasant but not tier 1 concertos,"All 69 Hyperion romantic piano, violin and cello concerto CDs are worth listening to and owning. They are refreshing and sometimes we even find a hidden treasure or a forgotten gem. Both of these are fine with Tovey being more the romanticism and Mackenzie the Scottish folk music concerto. They are tier 2 concertos worth having...certainly not mediocre."
4,Used for cake,I bought these to use to decorate my son's 1 year cake and then washed them off and stuck them in goodie bags... best way to go... and they are inexpensive enough that when you get tired of stepping on them you can just toss them without feeling too guilty!
1,CASIO EXILIM EX-Z30 -- Poor Customer Service,"After using the camera for 4 months the battery quit charging. Working with the camera store where it was purchased we determined that the problem was with the camera rather than with either the battery or charger. I returned the camera to Casio for repair. In response I got a repair estimate for $215. (Cassio's flat repair charge is $190 + shipping & handling + sales tax -- for a camera that cost $230.)The customer service rep told me that the 12 month warranty was not valid because the camera had suffered an ""impact."" After a couple of weeks I finally was able to speak with a manager who told me the case had a ""bad dent"" in it -- although the camera wasn't dented when I sent it to Casio for repair. The manager finally agreed to have the camera repaired as a ""courtesy."" When the ""repaired"" camera was returned to me the battery still wouldn't charge.Although I liked the camera while it worked, I definitely would not buy another Casio product."
1,Defective Design; Poor Casio Customer Service,LCD cracked after 3 pictures. Camera store said 3 others recently sold also cracked. CASIO knows the design is faulty but will not repair for free. CASIO said the LCD is an ACCESSORY. I asked how can I see the menu to change settings without the screen. DUH?? Don't buy CASIO products because they do not stand behind them.
4,Weak LCD Screen - Exceptional Customer Service,"We used this camera for about a month and we were very happy with it. That is until my husband carried the camera in his pocket on the way to the car and cracked the LCD screen making it unveiwable. We have always carried cameras this way and never had a problem. The warranty specifically states that the LCD is not covered. When I called Casio they said to go ahead and send it in and the technician would decide if it is covered. We prepared for the worst - a long process with a cost to repair equal to the price of a new camera. However, we couldn't believe that exactly one week after we mailed it to Casio it showed up at our door completely repaired - free of charge. We haven't even received proof of delivery from the post office. Excellent customer service by any standard."
5,Live In London - Only Shortcoming Its Not a Triple Album!!,"I'll leave the reviews of the ""Concert"" (1964) album to others. Its been covered. What is worth noting, its Live In London is a cracklin' HOT album. Super Tight renditions of the faster paced tunes especially. ""Darlin"" is worth double the price of admission alone! The only tragic thing about the entire Live In London set is that it isn't 36 tracks long by itself !!!"
4,Concert heaven?,"The 64 stuff is fine for what it is. The added track should come at the end of that sequence, rather than after the 68 concert. That's the only thing that mars the London set. It was fanatstic, with the horns adding a lot."
5,"Beach Boys in London,England.","The best recording of Beach Boy songs i have ever heard,Brilliant.A Must for Beach Boy Fans."
5,excellent concert,I was actually in the audience at the 64 Sacramento concert. The Boys were #1 on the West Coast at that time. They had a wonderful togetherness and their voices blended well. I have seen them in concert at least 5 times and their most recent version of the group still sounds OK. May the boys that have passed on rest in peace.
4,Good live versioins of a good band,"This is a good deal, two albums for the price of one. This includes live versions of classic Beach Boys tunes and good versions of older ones not originally done by the Beach Boys. If you like live music, this is the one to get for the Beach Boys."
4,excellent resource,Great way to introduce Greek. My dd enjoyed this along with her interest in the Percy Jackson books and movie.
5,A must for coaches,"This book is tremendously valuable for the coach who is seeking to maximize his/her performance as a coach as well as maximize his/her players' performance. In the major areas of sport psych, the chapter editors have done all the research for you. In most cases they have broken down the information so that the everyday coach can understand at least some of the research results. Don't plan on curling up with this one on a Sunday afternoon though - 900 pages of pretty heavy stuff. Better use this one more as a reference book to solve problems or develop a strategy."
3,just ok,"I bought this album when it came out and tossed it sometime way back when. I decided to buy it again. Now i know why i tossed it in the first time. Its just not that great. probably would have been better to buy their second album which had some killer cuts like ""All the young Dudes"". Oh well, live and learn."
1,DO NOT BUY!!!!!,POOR QUALITY-ALL BLUE VARNISH LACQUER IS GONEVALVES DO NT WORK EVEN AFTER SOME GOOD TREATMENTPOOR PRICE AND POOR TRUMPETGO FOR THE MORE BETTER MODELS AND PAY MORESHAVITISRAEL
3,Not the best brand of Pocket Trumpets.,I purchased this pocket trumpet because my previous one was stolen which was a Rosetti. When I brought my first pocket trumpet I wanted a Cecilio because of the look and claims. They were sold out and so my first one ended up being a Rossetti. I loved my original and thought this Cecilio would be even better. It took me a while to iron out the sound on it which is a bit more harsh and brassy than the Rosetti which I don't like. Now the paint is peeling away and the trumpet is looking as if a 5 year old made this is an art class. Not very good Quality.
3,wish i coud enjoy it more often...,I cannot use it for longer than a half hour without having to replace the battery! There's no way to rearrange the playlist so I have to scroll through all the songs to find the one i want. The sound quality is good but it's not convenient.
2,Problematic,"This things sucks literally--- the life out of any battery. The battery it came with died in 1.5 hours. I have tried three other batteries of different brands (one cheap Big Lots brand, an Energizer and a Duracell) and they get sucked dry quickly. Sometimes, right after you insert a new battery, it will already show that it has been depleted on the Mp3's battery meter. It has other good qualities but if you listen to it on the move a lot like me, consider something with better battery life."
2,Not good for Podcasting,This MP3 player is good for listening to music but not for books or podcasts. It says that it uses usb 2.0 but the upload times are much longer than for other mp3 players I've used. My main problem is that if you listen to large mp3 files (over 40 mins) and then shut off the player it resets and takes you back to the begining of the file. Then if you try to use the fast forward it moves very slow. You might have to hold the ff button down for 10 minutes to move ahead 30. It also seems to burn through batteries much faster than other mp3 players.
1,Terrible,The player broke in a couple of weeks. It was never able to load more than 14 songs. I would never recommend this item.
1,Do Not Waste Your Money,"I gave this product to my 15 year old son for Christmas. Last week, he loaded his music onto it. He used it for 3 days. Yes, it goes through batteries quickly. However, the biggest problem was that on day 3, as he was putting it into his pocket, the display cracked. I was watching him and he was not being rough with it. It just cracked and can no longer be read. The menu is worthless. He was so upset. This seems to be a serious design flaw. I don't think putting it into a pocket is a misuse which a product can not be expected to withstand. This was a total waste of money."
3,Very Pretty but scratches too easily,"I bought this for my Wife's Birthday and after 3 days of wearing it, it has several scratches on the stainless steel band. It leads me to believe that the Stainless Steel is not of very good quality. It is a very pretty watch though."
5,"AS A PREGNANT WOMAN, I THOROUGHLY ENJOYED THIS BOOK.","THIS BOOK COULDN'T HAVE BEEN WRITTEN AT A BETTER TIME. I WAS PREGNANT WITH MY FIRST CHILD AND OFTEN REFERRED TO IT FOR FUN, AND WHEN I EXPERIENCED CERTAIN AILMENTS, CRAVINGS, AND SYMPTOMS DURING PREGNANCY.THE BOOK WAS VERY WELL WRITTEN. IT WAS A PLEASURE TO READ ABOUT THE MANY MYTHS/WIVES TALES PASSED ON BY AFRICAN-AMERICAN WOMEN FROM GENERATION TO GENERATION. I PURCHASED SEVERAL COPIES AND GAVE THEM AS GIFTS TO FRIENDS WHO WERE ALSO EXPECTING.I CAN'T WAIT TO FOR CHRIS' NEXT BOOK TO HIT THE SHELVES. I'M SURE IT TOO WILL BE MOST ENJOYABLE TO READ.KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK COLEMAN!I LUV YA'!SHELLEY"
1,"Tiny Box, NOT Ginger Snap Cookies","This was VERY disappointing. I guess I didn't read the description close enough, but this is listed as Ginger Snaps and listed under cookies. These are NOT Ginger Snap cookies, they are tiny balls that look like dog food. The box itself is about half the size of a small matchbox. I feel taken advantage of. I ate one and it was nasty and burned. Real ginger, no doubt, and now that I own a dozen boxes (all of which together will fit in my pocket) I guess I will take them on my next trip to see if they stop motion sickness and take them like a pill rather than a Ginger Snap. Very misleading."
2,"OK, But Not Great","I am a Max Brand fan, but this is not one of his best. Brand has always been good with words, and this book is no exception. If you love Max Brand stories, you might want to read this one. But it seems to start in the middle (the actors discuss events that have not happened) and then it just ends abruptly."
2,It's OK,"You know what I've been looking for? A crocheted bag to wash my bras in. You know the kind that grandma made? A big bag of thick yarn and big enough to hold three or four bras with a thick yarn tie on it, that's what I'm looking for.This is thin mesh and, of course, the bra hooks come undone in the washing machine and mangle the bag and I would have been just as well off to not use it. I was hoping for better but until I find one of those grandma bags, I'll just keep complaining. This was cheap enough just to try."
3,it's SMALL!!!,"Ok, so not to sound like another dumb reviewer who didn't read the dimensions, but this is way smaller than I expected. I guess I should have realized... For those of you who can't picture- the pockets will fit undies, hose, etc, but not a bra that has underwire or shaping. I am dissappointed but also removed it from the packaging so probably won't return it, since it costs to do so. Anyway, other than that, nothing exciting, its a mesh bag for delicates."
4,Love it,Bought this product for my mom who is always hand washing her intimates so that they don't get tangled or damaged. She now uses this for all intimates and throws them straight into the machine on gentle!
5,Every girl needs one...or two!,"Perfect size for lingerie and stockings. Also, good for keeping pairs of socks together. Well made. Stays zipped in the laundry, too."
3,It is ok,"the quality is ok, but not that protective to the clothing. overall is ok.maybe is will be good for the silk scarf."
3,Not completely separated compartments,"The 4 compartments are not closed off enough by the center dividers, and my things end up getting mixed up in the bag"
1,of course it doesn't work....,"....because there's nothing in it. I wish I had read about products like these....so I took the whole bottle, even bought the bigger bottles, and guess what happened? Nada. No overdose because they're selling you basically a molecule of the original substance. Congrats to me for wasting money."
3,it's comfy and flexible,"The brim width is not as measured in description. That is a bit dissappointing, but still not a bad buy."
2,"OK, but not great","I found this book to be a shallow view into present day Kazakhstan, with small insight into the region as a whole. The book does little to shed light on the cultural history and core of Kazakhstani society. An easy read, but not especially enlightening. ""The Lost Heart of Asia"" is a better bet for an incredible overview of the regions ebbs and flows and the cultural nuances which influence Central Asia, which is a more helpful view. Also consider ""The Silent Steppe"" for a modern history of the country."
5,Economical and easy to use,"I am a runner and mix this with orange juice after a run. It mixes in easily and the taste is very similar to an expensive soy protein mixture that I used previously. Before using soy protein, I mixed whey powder into my orange juice, but switched to soy protein because it has a much higher percentage of arginine. The soy protein actually stirs in more easily than does whey powder. The taste and texture is very different than whey powder, but I like both."
2,Oh my.,"I'm sure this does what it's supposed to, but wow. It is REALLY gritty even when buried in a delicious fruit and yogurt smoothie. I'm going to have to try something else, I'm afraid."
4,"good, not great","no taste but that is why i bought it. INGREDIENTS: soy. no artificial junk here. as w/ all protein shakes it has an acquired taste. tip- juice helps it dissolve better (apple, blueberry, or pom)no rumbles in the stomach like Myo**ex. just be careful w/ shelf life as there are no preservatives."
3,OK,"I bought this mostly for use in breakfast smoothies. The first time using it, I added 3 tablespoons to a mixed berry smoothie (smoothie recipe on the bag calls for 3 TBS), and it was awful. It left a terrible after-taste that lingered for hours. Maybe it's better with bananas and apples, as in the recipe on the bag, than berries. Next time, I added only 1 TBS and it tasted fine and then increased to 2 TBS, which works too. It's a good additive to homemade breads. I've put the remaining 3 bags of the 4-pack in the freezer because it'll take a while to use it all. I like that it's free of artificial additives that so many protein powders have. Acceptable product, good price."
2,Avoid using in Shakes/Drinks,"Although the product claims to be a viable additive for shakes/drinks, our experience is it won't dissolve without a blender.Simply put it clumps.The taste is fine, actually good, so my recommendation is to look elsewhere for a drink supplement."
5,"it meets their claims, good value","The package suggests apple and banana together. I think the idea is that the pulp from the apple will get your mind off of the typical protein powder texture, but I found I like double the banana and no apple instead.Some have complained about clumping. That's to be expected for protein powder; especially if they don't add things you don't want in your food. We have a Hamilton Beach hand blender that does a great job mixing it so there are no clumps. It's great for making smoothies, etc. The stem detaches for easy cleaning. A great gadget that will really help here.It's a good value and they don't add things you don't want in your food."
5,C.E.T. Dog Chews,Great product at a great price!! my dog loves these after his walk and they have improved his gums and teeth... what more can you ask for!
4,Kickin' music from Kickin' times,Grandmaster flash is the king and there is no question about it. This album collects the highlights of the glory days of his career and each track is a heavy groove and great listening. His scratching and sampling are where it all came from. buy it.
4,"""Primer"" is probably a good word.","This is an excellent beginning book on building with stone. No mention of necessary information regarding general house building is included. You are supposed to find that elsewhere. This is about building stone walls to become a building. The technique it presents is different than slipform wall building and creates walls that are remarkably good looking, straight and will endure for decades, maybe even centuries. Great book and I highly reccomend it for anyone thinking about using stone as a building material."
1,Please pass the turkey's!,"What a GREAT day for the American people! A Real live presidential doll with a turkey yet! I just cant figure out who the bigger turkey is. This needs to go in a time capsule for sure, so people generations from now can marvel at the sophistication as well as patriotism that existed during the Iraq conflict. And for sure thank you to the money grubbing company that produced this turkey of a gift! Maybe they could do John Kennedy in his open Lincoln just before he was shot! Or how about Honest Abe eating popcorn just before old John W. Booth snuck in and plugged him. The ideas are endless as well as tasteless, kind of like that plastic turkey Jorge is holding!!!"
4,Johann Sebastian Bach: 6 Suites per Violoncello Solo Senza Basso,Johann Sebastian Bach: 6 Suites per Violoncello Solo Senza Basso is a recording of 6 Suites for Cello played by Peter Wispelwey. This recording is a Channel Classics recording from 1998. The linernotes have been written by Mr Wispelwey himself and are well-written and quite informative. Recommended. 4/5.
5,THE VERY BEST,Every single word of the Old and New Testament is found in this Concordance with the Hebrew dictionary for the Old Testament and the Greek dictionary for the New Testament.It is a great help when you need clarification of any word in any passage in any of the books of the Bible.I have owned this book since 1973 and I use it to this day during my study of the Word.I highly recommend this to everyone that reads the KJV Bible and wonders what certain words actually mean in the original tongue.
2,Very very poor book,"This book didn't help me at all. It contains a number of sample sites, including all the necessary code to get there. Unfortunately, this code is almost never explained. This whole book is for ""imitating monkeys"" who just enter the described code in their computer without understanding any logic behind. I recommend everybody who is interested in quickly learning the logic behind to buy the Visual InterDev book from Microsoft Press."
1,This book does not worth to be put on the shelf.,I think the tutorial on Microsoft web site (Interdev) is better than any topic in this book. I won't recommend other people to buy this.
1,this book didn't help me at all!,"This book was hard to read (was very boring!!!), and overall - didn't contribute almost anything to what I knew before reading it."
2,"A ""build your own"" book should be easier to build","The problem with this book, like many others that teach by doing, is getting to the doing part. For this book it was getting Visual InterDev set up so you could start to build the application. I found that in to many instances the step by step instructions lead to a black hole. I would recommend instead you buy Microsoft's Mastering Visual Interdev"
1,Don't waste your time,"Despite some of the negative reviews, I figured that the price was low enough that surely there was something to be gained from the book, even if it was terribly dated. The problem with this book is that in the author's own words, she really never had to deal with this issue. In the first chapter she talks about how she planned to work and consult at the same time, but that she was laid-off right at the moment she was ready to start her consulting practice....uh OK, so the rest of the advice seems very suspect from Chapter 1.And the rest of that ""advice""? Let me sum it up - be careful about legal and ethical conflicts with your current employer and make sure you've got a plan for dealing with working two jobs. That's about it (well, duh!!).Waste of my time."
2,It okay,"This book is okay I was not really that impress with it however, it does have some information that can be used."
1,Ever heard of the Internet?,"Although it covers general principles, the book is too dated to be at all useful in a practical sense. I am sorry I bought it. There are no URLs only phone numbers and addresses. The closest this comes to the modern age is a recommendation to get a modem on your computer."
1,Waste Of Money,The book didn't help one bit. Its basically a better written retelling of whats available on the official Sims Online Website and the booklet you get with the game.You won't learn anything unique or special to enhance your game experience.
4,Love comes to those with love in their hearts,"This is Sally Morningstar, author of this title. I am responding to Kim Scudazio's 'rave' review of the book, which seems to have not worked for her. However, this book is not a joke and the magic does work. For example, I was informed that the love cake was made on three separate occasions and each time an engagement was announced within a few days. Also, when working with magic, it will only work for those who are ready for love to come into their lives. I suggest to Kim that perhaps, leaving a review of such scathing nature may point to the fact that she has trouble in the love department anyway. But we are all entitled to our opinions. However, take a look inside the book. It is simple, natural magic, aimed at those who have no deep experience of the magical world. And, like my other magical books, the spells and potions do work very effectively. Blessed be and may love touch you lightly on your journey through life."
5,Loved It.....,"I got this armoire for my sister-in-law. Shes wanted one for ages and this looked like a beautiful item in its description. I ordered it and could not be more pleased with the entire transaction and my sister-in-law was truly on cloud nine about getting it. It has a beautiful finish, the few parts that required assemble fit perfectly and were very easy to assemble and it is an impressive piece of furniture. I don't use jewelry but if I did I would order one for myself.The seller sent the item on time and it was packaged so well I don't see how it could have been damaged even if someone tried.The one warning I would give is be sure you have help moving it when it arrives if you are not pretty strong. It is one heavy box to man-handle alone. I would suggest two people to move the box without any chance of injury.All in all I am completely pleased with both the armoire and the seller. Good job folks - keep it up."
4,Very Nice Product,"Product arrived packaged very well and no damage. Cherry color is nice and everything functions correctly; was easy to put together. One minor issue, one of the side opening cabinets there was a magnet on the actual door but was not a plate attached to the side for it to say shut. Having to go through the manufacturer to get a replacement part and I'm told it will take 4-6 weeks. It is a Christmas present so will not be fully functional till I get the striker plate for the magnet on the door to keep it shut. Other than that, all is well; nice quality."
5,Excellent book,"I am not from Poland, my husband is. He enjoys the recipes from this cookbook. The directions are very easy to follow. There are many photographs depicting how to create the dishes. I highly recommend this book- even if the ingredients are hard to find or a bit confusing (As the above reviewer noted)."
1,Polish Cooking 2005 edition,"Don't be fooled into buying this book, if you loved the older version with all the great pictures. There are no pictures in this one, unlike the older 1991 version. The book is also smaller making it difficult to keep it open when looking at a recipe.The recipies are mostly the same, though. Too bad the author was convinced to go with a more unfriendly cookbook style than the wonderful earlier versions of this book."
4,Very authentic yet easy Polish cooking,"My parents (who emigrated from Poland) consider this the most authentic Polish cookbook they have come across. Many of the recipes in here are very similar to ones that my family uses. If you're from the north of Poland, near the Baltic coast, you'll probably feel the same. Many other Polish cookbooks use versions of recipes that are more authentic to other parts of Poland, which doesn't always taste right to us. But when my mother visits and doesn't have her recipe for something, she will often use this book instead. The recipes have also been ""Americanized"" somewhat to make finding ingredients easier (compared to the ""truly"" authentic recipes in other books), or leverage equipment found in most American kitchens. However, there are still some esoteric directions or ingredients which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. BTW, another reviewer had trouble finding ""instant flour"". This is easily dissolving flour such as Wondra."
1,unknown ingredients,recipe for Honey-Walnut Mazurka on page 150 calls for all-purpose flour and Instant flour....what is instant flour? Have called Pillsbury and Gold Medal flour companies and they don't know what it is.
1,Totally Useless with Cable Station Cable,"I should have listened to the previous reviewer. I own both the Planet Waves Cable Station Pedal Board Kit and the Custom Cable Kit. These plugs are way too thin to fit on the cable that comes with them. The fit is not even close, and it is very disappointing to see these plugs advertised with ""Cable Station"" in both the name and description."
2,Get a different one,"The first one of these I got was broken right out of the box - the CD player didn't work at all. Since I had already thrown the box away, I had to deal with Memorex directly and experienced very poor customer service. I finally got it replaced and am having the same problem less than a year later. I would not purchase a Memorex again as a result of this experience."
2,Dog-Licious for who???,"Delivered as promised. After getting it, buyer's regret. Alittle pricey for what you get. I dont think they smell like chicken or bacon like advertised but maybe the dogs did....if they did, they certainly act like they did. Would not buy again for the $$."
3,My dog wasn't really into it,"I thought that this would be a lot of fun, but it was kind of a disappointment. We have an Austrailian Shepard-Autrailian Cattle Dog mix who loves to jump and play and is pretty high energy. He was interested in this only for a few minutes and did not seem to like the taste much. Also, it has kind of a strange smell, and if you don't get a bubble blower with it, you have to put your finger in the solution to use the bubble wand."
3,Bubbles,I'm a little disappointed since they don't make that much bubbles. I can't remember if it brought a wand or what. It's a good thing I had an old wand from regular bubbles that was small enough to fit in the bottle. Perhaps the reason it doesn't make much bubbles it could be it might be old suds.
4,Dogs like 'em,"These are pretty good bubbles. My dogs love them, but I don't think they smell much like the scents they claim to be. I use them in a bubble gun and they go crazy trying to snap them all up. As long as my dogs are happy with them, I'm happy."
1,Barely makes bubbles and there is really no scent to them.,"I had high hopes for this product but they're a big disappointment. They both smell the same and neither smells like bacon or BBQ chicken. Also, the wand they come with doesn't do much. I'd return them but shipping would cost more than the bubbles. Live and learn."
2,Disappointing,The bubbles did not smell any different than regular bubbles but are more expensive. My dog showed no interest in them.
4,It is winter time... moisture is greatly needed!,"I have been using Bioelements for over a year. I love this moisturizer because it doesn't leave a heavy greasy feeling on your face, yet absorbs and moisturizes your face upon application.This is great stuff and with winter on us, it is a must for dry skin!"
3,Totally manual operation,"Appears to be well made, time will tell. It is a loud machine, for those concerned with noise. My only complaint is that it does NOT adjust the date automatically, and will punch dates such as Apr 31 on a 30 day month."
5,Great for any Hero deck.,"E-Hero Ocean is a great card for a Hero deck, letting you bring Heroes from your grave back to your hand. Also with Premium Pack 2's E-Hero Woodsman, you can Fusion summon E-Hero Terra Firma, also from Premium Pack 2."
4,Intense story,"Mr. Hanley is no Tom Clancy but the story is fantastic. A fast read that keeps your attention. Mr. Hanley recounts his days as a B-29 Navigator and how in March of 1945 his plane was shot down over Japan. He was taken prisoner but not afforded POW status due to the Japanese bitterness involving the fire bombings they had recently undergone only a few weeks earlier. The Japanese considered Mr. Hanley a ""Special Prisoner"", essentially a war criminal. His treatment was inhumane at best and more realistically should be considered sadistic. Mr. Hanley recounts his bitterness and hatred towards those that tortured him. I hope he eventually found some resolution."
5,Chance meeting.,"I met the author at a Military Seminar at UNT last fall. He seemed a very likeable gentleman and I found his book most interesting. I missed the big war by a few years myself, but enjoy keeping up with the little known stories of WW II. I really enjoyed the book and have since passed in on to a couple of my coffee mates, both of whom did serve in the Army at that time. They are likewise most pleased with the book. It is a comfirmation of other books dealing with the treatment of allied prisoners by the Japanese. A part of history we must not forget."
4,Generals,"Pretty decent game, make sure you have access to the router you use to connect to the internet because you need to forward some ports to be able to play online."
2,Whoa...just WAY to much detail,"There are no words for this book. It stinks. How could a writer as good as Modesitt turn out something as awful as this? I know the old saying goes, "" A lifetime of boredom with two days of sheer terror,"" but this was taking it overboard. The characters are flat, and the plot got lost in the details. It just went on and on...if you like descriptive books, this is one for you, but if you like action, bypass this all together."
4,Magic So Real You Can Feel It!,"I have read the Soprano Sorceress several times and my appreciation of L.E. Modesitt's talent grows with each reading. He is one of the few writers who communicates the essence of magic realistically without the usual hackneyed device of a charmed amulet or whatever. He went a bit heavy on the entropic balance problem, the need to replenish energy after casting spells, but his alignment of intention to results made the spellcasting so real I could easily visualize every one of the results.The heroine's concerns were legitimate, if repeated a few times more than necessary. I thought Anna was portrayed realistically, although she was somewhat less sensual than I would have expected.I think her concerns about being a powerful woman in a male-dominated world were entirely valid. The interestingly illiterate rantings about this heroine would seem to support the author's contention that a powerful woman is seen as a threat by certain men."
2,This is not a good book...,"Interesting concept (thus, the two stars), too bad the writing was so poor. Most of this book seemed to be ""filler"", not solid, interesting content. Phrases and actions were repeated over and over, as if they were there only to make the book longer. I've been struggling to get through this book and have gotten halfway, thinking that something interesting was sure to happen soon, but I haven't succeeded yet; after reading these reviews and realizing that the book will not be changing and will remain boring and annoying for another half, I probably will not finish it. What a disappointment. It reminds me of another book that I tried to read, by an author that I usually love...""Charmed Sphere"" by Catherine Asaro. I usually love her books, but that one had many things in common with ""The Soprano Sorceress""...unfortunately. UGH. I don't understand how such talented authors can tolerate publishing material that is so clearly substandard to their usual work."
4,Almost perfect - Can't wait for number two,"This book is one of the ""new"" books I've recently read, while waiting for PoD. It's fun, easygoing reading and very, very hard to put down. The plot is not very original, but in the end, wich plots are? It's the way the book is written that determins if it's a winner or not. This one surley is!"
3,It ain't over 'till the ....,"Well, it will never be over then, in this book, because doing magic keeps you skinny and in need of huge quantities of food.The book is a typical, for this genre, ""Yanked from the real world"" sort of fantasy. As usual, the person is yanked for a <insert italics> PURPOSE.Ok, it's formula. It's also entertaining, and it has enough villians, and a good enough understanding of realpolitic to make it entirely enjoyable, formula or not. Good airplane reading, I'm looking for the sequels for my airplane trip tonight."
5,Intro to an author is a pleasure...,"If a book is meant to entertain, this is a success. If a book is meant to make you care about characters, this is a triumph. If a book is meant to keep you up late, this is a tremendously victorious tale. For three consecutive nights, I sat in my room, dark except for the dim table lamp, covers wrapped around my shoulders and eyes busilly scanning page to page. I glanced at the clock every half hour, telling myself this would be my last chapter until 3am hit, and I kicked myself away from this endearing soprano. She isn't sure of herself, she MAKES herself do things. Like so many musicians, she puts herself into her music, hence, her spells are a part of her. This totally engrossing book kept me up until I finished it (as all my co-workers can tell you) and I recomend it to anyone who likes both fantasy and the magic of music."
4,Slightly less than Modesitt's best,"Still one of the most enjoyable writers around. This poorly done take-off on Spellsinger by Foster and on Modesitt's own Recluce series is still good fun due to the quality of the writing and the no-nonsense common-sensical attitute of the protagonist. As with Recluce there is a magical balance in the world and the protagonist is the one who has been given the strength to put it back in order. Knowledge of our world also helps the heroine in her self-appointed quest. In Recluce, at least the ability to do magic varied with the person...let us hope that the facile explanation given in the book about no one willing to teach, learn or experiment is not the who;e truth. Modesitt should have been better than this."
3,disappointing when compared with recluse series,"When compared with his Recluse series, this book is something of a disappointment, in part because the rich detail of the Magician's discovery of his powers/and the detail of the background of the(a) magic system, and (b) the craft involved aremissing. Anna, the lead character, simply mastersthe magic beyond anyone elses ability in between the paragraphs, as is done in much fantasy writing. the background of the magic betweenharmony and dissonance, while hinted at, is notdeveloped. the stylistic device of moving amongthe various protagonists that modesitt employs inthe recluse series is much less effective in thisvolume, perhaps because the people/power is lesswell-defined. mondesitt either hasn't thoughtdeeply enough about the world structure of thismagic as yet, or is simply uncomfortable with awoman as the main character."
2,Moments of interest peppered in a vat of tedium.,"While this book had some exciting moments, I found myself losing patience frequently--with Anna for being aggressive instead of effective (if all else fails, kill 'em.), with the characters around her for being almost unfailingly dimwitted or degenerate, or with Modesitt for using 600+ pages where 300 would have sufficed. There were some exciting moments, and some times where I found myself fleetingly beginning to like a character, but mostly I was either yawning or irritated.p.s. Modesitt needs to learn more about horses if he wishes to write realistically about them. Until then, perhaps his characters should have faithful dogs."
2,A major disappointment,I started the book with great expectations and was very disappointed.The plot was almost non-existent and the characters almost unbelievably shallow.I expected this to be a start of a new gripping fantasy-saga but this book was not even close.If you want to waste your time read this one.
1,Don't bother...,"I think this book is quite a step down from Modesitt's usual caliber. And from its strong effeminate perspective, I almost suspect Modesitt had less to do with it than his wife. Although I haven't quite finished it yet I can safely say that the story line drags, any conflict is usually resolved in a one-sided manner, characters are poorly developed, the eternal male/female role battle is beat to death (along with the heat), the basis and cost of musical sorcery is not well-explained, and the magical lyrics are almost comical. It's taken me a month or two to get almost through this book because it keeps returning to the bottom of my stack. Find some other book that will stay at the top of yours."
3,a recycled storyline,"While I enjoyed the storyline, Has anyone noticed the profound likeness to the Spellsinger Series by Alan Dean Foster?"
3,About what I'd expected,"I've read several of the Recluce series books, and thought I'd try something else by Modesitt. There really isn't a great deal of difference between this books and those in the Saga of Recluce, however. There's still the same alternation between the main plot and chapters dealing with leading figures around the world. There's still the same pressure forcing the main character along the plotline. There are even references to ""orderspelling"" water. But there are some differences between this book and the Saga, however. The obvious one is the setting--just another ordinary-person-from-our-world-transported-into-an-alternate-dimension-where-magic-works-by-music-or-poetry situation instead of the fairly original Recluce setting. And there's one other difference I noted. Anna's ""lutar"" has more strings than Ayrlyn's."
3,dissappointment!,i was intrigued by the blurb on the back cover enough to look past the ridiculous cover art and completely embaressing name only to find a book with whimpy one dimensional characters. besdies describing the heat and every meal the main character eats the books isn't much more. the reader is badgered to death with stupid and immaterial facts that do nothing for the plot and i find myself avoiding this book. characters come and go and i feel no connection with any of them. pick another book when rummaging through the bookstore shelf rather than just picking one up like i did. this is a dissappointing read that will have you wondering why you ever starting reading in the first place/
3,Not Free SF Reader,"A bog standard university music faculty member gets transported to a fantasy world. While no-one takes a second look at here there, in this world music drives magic, so she is potentially quite powerful.That is, if she can survive in a male dominated ruthless feudal world, after her protector goes out of the picture, and a spell goes awry."
2,A mediocre read.,"I can not bring myself to finish this book. Poorly written, I found the story line dull. A woman transported to another world who finds she is a sorceress, using her singing to kill armies sent to destroy. This new world and the characters have no depth and the writing quality is very poor. I would not recommend this book."
4,Great driving Moc,"This is the third par of the Minnetonka driving Moc I've had in the last 15 years. They've changed the bumps on the boton to litle tiny ones, but all in all, a great shoe. FAR less expensive than a Cole-Han, Trask, or such, and you don't get that much more in those Moccasins costing 3 times as much. These are structured with nice, solid leather, not all soft like an around the cain version. GOOD PRODUCT!"
4,Good Read,"This is a book I purchased for some people at work, who enjoy Poems,everyone had good comments to say about it."
2,Don't waste your money.,"First off; this isn't a DVD it's a CDRom. Second it only has on set of question, 75 total and it doesn't explain anyting in detail. Your better off getting the Books insead."
1,Kingston Chip,"My computer stopped working when I installed the memory chip. After some effort, I restored the computer by reinstalling my old chip. I would like to talk to Kingston without going through Amazon."
4,Great Memory,Of course this was for an older system but it worked perfect. Pass all diagnostics without having to tweek anything.
1,Panic (1976) DVD,This is the worst transfer of a movie I have ever seen. I appears to have beeen done with an inferiior video camera. The picture was transferred in wide screen but it is not a wide screen movie so the picture is compressed. It jitters and freezes a couple of frames every few seconds. I cannot believe Amazon would sell such an inferior product. I paid $16.00 for this! I will be returning it for a refund and fully expect to get it!
4,Handy laundry bag,"These are so great to use. Put one in your trunk, put one in your guest bedroom, put one next to your closet. These little pop-up bags are so handy you will find more uses than just dirty laundry. You can take one to the beach, you can put your kids toys in one, or you can keep the dogs stuff in one."
3,Not as pictured,This is a good product but it is not quite as pictured and I received a white one not blue.
2,Tears and breaks down too easily,"I bought this for my son's room. Within one night, my son had tried to move the laundry bag to the laundry for me from his bedroom. He was too short to do it, though, and it popped out the little plastic bars and tore the mesh. I have to keep it away from him now and not let him help, which is a shame since he really wants to be helpful (he's five and just learning to do household things). It's continued to rip from then on and I have to be so careful from then on that I will most likely have to pitch it in another month or so. I just use it right now for socks and wash clothes. I wouldn't recommend this for anyone with children or anything heavy. The design is on the right track, but just isn't there yet."
1,Not the item pictured--No Pocket,"Disappointed that this isn't the one pictured, with the pocket. The one shown is the Dazz one with pocket, but it's not currently available in white, so I ordered this one--expecting it to have the pocket. Bait and switch?"
2,doesn't truly pop up,"I thought these white mesh hampers would be like some I already have, which look just like the picture. In reality, they come with little 10 inch white plastic tubes you have to insert to hold them open. So, not as handy as the ones that pop open and stay open on their own."
5,Wonderful Memories,"This book came out when I was about 2 years old, and at 40-ish, I still love it! I have read it to my nieces and nephew more than once. They love the illustrations as much as I do. We love that you find new things in the drawings every time you read it. Great for the imagination!"
2,"I was hoping this was going to be just as good as Empire of the East was, but ....","Well, I was hoping Saberhagen with this book was going to carry forward the saga that 'Empire of the East' had laid out, but I was mistaken. It took a long time to lay out the plot and when he finished setting the stage for the players, he hurried through and finished the ending??? It seems like he finished the book abruptly because a) he ran out of ideas or more likely b) his editor was getting on his case, which is what I suspect. I understand he had to dovetail it into his existing story arcs, but it seems he let the story fall from his grasp just when it was starting to get really interesting.P.S. - Writing this review kills me, because I consider 'Empire of the East' one of the finest imaginative and thought provoking books I've had the pleasure to read. I consider it up on par with some of Zelazny's works. It's a shame, I know he can do better."
1,Crap,"I bought this book because I liked Saberhagen's Empire of the East. However, this book could not be more different. I had to check to make sure that it was by the same author, and not some third party spinoff. Imagine if a senile Tolkien made a sequel to The Lord of the Rings that was aimed at ten year old children. This book is like that, but even worse. After reading this I'm now trying to forget as much about this book as possible: do yourself a favor and don't buy it in the first place."
2,not the best of this series,"I am a big fan of Empire of the East and the Sword series. I have read them many times and came across Ardnehs Sword by accident in the book store.Ardnehs Sword was mediocre. I enjoy reading Saberhagens style and overall enjoyed the book. But what was the point? There was so much more that could have been done with this book that transitioned between Empire and the Sword series...I just don't see what value was added with Ardnehs Sword.If you are a fan of the series, buy it, enjoy it. But don't set your expectations too high.Spoiler - honestly it could be summed up in a sentence or two. Rolfs descendent finds leftover technology that creates the Gods out of random humans. That pretty much sums it up."
3,Over my head,"Lots of detail and mostly easy to read, but some important terminology and practices are not explained that a 1st timer would not know."
3,"Inspiration, Not Instruction","I have read this book and own it. It is one I revisit for its lush photographs and to remind me of my vision for my own garden. The work is rich with history and inspiring photos, however the subject tends to be large grounds and commercial developments. It is not intended to be instructional, nor does it really explain the design process when creating a tropical landscape. Some photos label plant materials used, while others just focus on landscape structures. It is worth owning, but is limited in its utility."
4,Old School Always Works,"I know you look like an order taker at McDonalds wearing this, and the wire sometimes tangles up in the car, but it works every time. Blackberry Curve users? Get the 2.5mm to 3.5 mm adapter at Verizon VHS25-35MM for 4 bucks. Enjoy!"
1,disappointed,"The product worked fine for about 3 weeks, but now I am not able to hear what people are saying.Moreover, the adjustable band that goes across your head is not sturdy anymore and slips off when I bend my head over."
4,Works well...so what if you look like a geek,"Okay, so it is stupid looking. However, it works great and if you drive alone -- who cares."
3,"Not such a great fit, but a great price.",The fit is awkward. It tends to slip. On any head. I used a paper clip to stabilize the earpiece. Call me MacGyver.
3,2.5mm jack,"I suppose I got mixed up when I ordered these, but they are 2.5mm. The projuct title for headsets should reference what size jack they are for to help the consumer, or it should at least be clear in the product description without jumping to a details page. I need 3.5mm, so I'm disapppointed. I haven't even tried them yet; I'll have to buy an adaptor."
5,Excellent quality,"This is a GREAT sleeping bag - very comfortable, easy to slip into and out of. It gives my tent a feeling of luxury!"
4,Complete Introduction,"This book covers all the features of EXCEL'97 in detail. It begins at the beginning (What is a toolbar?)and goes on to Visual Basic. The main drawback of a book of this type is that it concentrates on describing features one after the other. Like reading a dictionary, knowing a lot of words doesn't mean you are developing fluency.An exception to this remark is the last chapter in the book ""Sample Visual Basic Application"". I'm a novice in this area, so experts might not agree with me. But I found this example really got my imagination. It describes a project that picks up data from an outside monitoring station on a regularly updated basis, puts it into EXCEL, generates a regularly updated chart, and makes a report using WORD. The entire sequence is automatic. This example puts EXCEL to work with other applications in a complex project showing me what is possible. Variations on this theme could be used for many other projects."
5,Everything needed and still easy to read.,"Sometimes the Microsoft book is good and sometimes it isn't- this time it's the best. The book is a catalog of everything, with clear instructions. There's no need to read it cover to cover, though that will give you lots of ideas for what can be done. Just look in the index when you need something and flip back to the clear instructions and helpful illustrations. The book's pretty hefty, so the included book-on-CD is the best way to tote it around as a reference. Keep the CD at work for surreptitious reference and be the office Excel expert!"
1,total rip off,I will now have to check my credit card statement to see if I was charged for a book I ordered that I never received ! Buyers beware !
5,Gilpin history back to 1206,"I bought this book to help research my family history. I knew my grandmother was from Kentmere and was born in the green quarter, but I had no idea whether or not she was descended from the Gilpins of Kentmere Hall. This author of this book has done a lot of research and saved me a great deal of legwork and effort. It describes in detail the link between the green quarter Gilpins and those of Kentmere Hall.. Obviously there are many Gilpins branching off, and the latter part of the book details the links down to the author rather than my part of the family, but it would be impossible to cover all branches. The book contains many interesting stories which have been unearthed in the search for information, and starts dramatically with a detailed account of how the famous ""slaying of the wild boar"" was achieved by Richard de Guylpyn in 1206.Overall a very good book with excellent research and a pleasure to read."
1,Color is not Oil Rubbed Bronze,The tub spout is basically black. I have seen several 'types' of oil rubbed bronze products and the cheap ones are basically black and sometimes have red lines to make it looked 'rubbed'. This is is just black... doesn't match anything near oil rubbed bronze. FALSE ADVERTISING.
3,Well made but lacking support.,"Rubbermaid makes a good product, but other than the frame, this one has zero support.In the photo it looks rigid...like you could pick it up and it wouldn't sag. I purchased this box to storefloral stems and floral supplies which all tend to shift to the middle when the box is moved.Although I would order it again, be warned: you will need to make a support for the bottom out of cardboardor other rigid material if you need to move this box frequently. I would happily pay more if Rubbermaid includeda fold-up piece with this as it is excellent otherwise."
3,Zipper Broken,When I received this product the zipper was broken. I did like that if holds numerous roll wrap and fits easily under a bed.
2,Outside is flimsy,Didn't realize how flimsy the outside is. It bends easy which isn't very convenient and I think I will probably crease and bend more items that are stored in it.
4,Serves its purpose,"After reading the other reviews, I knew what I was getting - a zippered cloth bag with cardboard sides and a useless handle. I filled it with a TON of stuff and had no problems sliding it over the carpet and under my bed. i would never use the handle to pick up the bag, and to note, the zipper seems kind of flimsy. But it was only $12 (from Amazon) and it's serving its purpose so I'm happy."
4,great for wrapping paper,"This works well for storing wrapping paper under my bed, which is what I bought it for. It also fits well under my bed--many plastic underbed storage containers are too deep. It is a bit flimsy."
5,Just as described,"If your looking for something heavy duty or hard outside material, this is not it. This is a zipper up system that is soft, so that your sheets and blankets can still breath while inside. It has cedar sides built in, which add some stability so that it dosnt just collapse. It fit under the bed perfectly. I actually have 3 sets of sheets and a blanket in it. Good deal for what it offers, but would not recommend trying to overfill it as you may damage the zipper, as with any material item like this."
2,Unstable,"When I purchased the container, I expected to use it for wrapping paper storage. What I got was a flimsy, unstructured canvas bag with zippers. Because this product doesn't hold its shape, it makes it almost impossible to successfully move or transport. As long as you don't plan on moving this unit or use it to store small items, then you will have no problem. If you plan on using it otherwise, steer clear!!"
2,It Is not what it seems,Very flimsy case. It fits the rolls but collapses around them also. I was disappointed that the case could not hold up under any weight.
3,"Good for storing seasonal items, not sturdy for everyday use","Product is as described and shipped fast, however I wish the bottom was a bit sturdier and rigid. It is ideal for storing seasonal items such as sweaters or blankets, and is slim enough to fit under the bed, but because the inserts are flexible, the tote gives a bit and is not good for certain items. All in all I am satisfied with this product."
5,Great!,Worked out perfect for what I needed it for-wrapping paper. Also like the fact that it folds up small for storage.
4,Basic underbed storage,Purchased two of these off amazon for $14 about 4 months back. The sides are flimsy but once you fill it up with clothes or bedding the sides do stay up. It is easy to pull out and the fabric makes me think it will hold up nicely for many years. I will be buying more but will wait for the price to come down as I am not sure it is really worth $20.
3,Worked for what I needed at the time,It is a little flimsy but it really worked for what I needed at the time. I put up seasonal clothes in it. No idea where they get the cedar idea from. I like that they fold up when not in use.
4,It fits,under the bed. I use it to store the sheets. Just wish the side walls weren't so soft. This would be better if there were straight pieces of plastic sewn in the sides to keep it straight when pushing it under the bed. That would've gotten it 5 stars.
3,Basically acts as a dust cover,I purchased this product to use as a table leaf protector. There's not much protection provided although it should do a decent job of keeping spiders and moths out and keeping the leaf dust-free. I wouldn't trust the handles on this thing with any more weight than when it's empty. Overall it's fairly flimsy and probably wasn't quite worth what I paid for it. If I had my way I would have bought the table with the butterfly leaf but that's a separate matter. :)
4,Convenient for extra storage space,"I bought this box to use for extra storage space under the bed. (Sheet sets, towels, extra blankets) It is quite roomy and holds at least several sheet sets and a blanket or two depending on the size. It zips on three sides so its easy to open and close. I'm happy with the purchase and think it was a good value for the price."
2,Not very exciting,"I got what I paid for - which isn't much.I was expecting it to be flimsy, which it is, but I was also expecting it to fit under my bed and it doesn't.It does however work in my closet so it's not useless. But be warned, it is not much more than a few pieces of wood and papery fabric."
2,Flimsy,"You would think by looking at this thing it would be a ""case"", but it isn't. It is simply a fabric with a zipper and does not work well for holding left over wrapping paper from Christmas. Good luck pushing it under the bed."
3,Depends on what you're using it for,"I dont' see how this possibly could be used for clothing or anything of any weight, but I bought it to hold wrapping paper and related items and it's perfect for that. Those trash-can-looking plastic things that get sold right after Christmas aren't tall enough to hold most wrapping-paper rolls (who designs those things and how out of it are they?). This is exactly the right length, and it fits underneath a bed easily."
4,"Perfect, but ONLY for under the bed sheet storage","This item is a great thing to have to keep your spare sheets under the bed. It is the perfect size for about 3-4 sets of sheets for a king size bed. It would hold much more for a small bed. The only thing to know before hand is that this is not a sturdy storage container, and the cedar inserts are pretty much 3 strips of cardboard, so do not think this is something you will be able to easily transport. It's possible it would be O.K. for storing some light summer clothes, but again- it is not sturdy. I love mine for it's purpose, there is no need to waste closet or shelf space with bulky sheets when they are clean and sealed under the bed!"
3,Cloth zipper bag,"This is not exactly what I expected. This ""Box"" has cardboard like inserts sew into the sides... but the bottom is fabric. So you put your clothing or whatever in it and if you pick it up it just sags... I thought it would be more like the fabric cubicles that I bought from target. They have an insert that goes in the bottom to keep the sides up and keep the bottom from sagging like a sack. I put my own piece of cardboard in the bottom so problem solved. This is for indoor storage of course. It's big, and has lots of room. Looks better than an XL ziplock bag but doesn't hold as much... and costs more. Overall I wish I had passed on this one."
2,"Disappointing, a real flop","Rubbermaid 3F19 Configurations XL 42-Inch Three-Handle Low-Profile Box with Cedar Inserts, NaturalI was disappointed with the storage box. I expected better from Rubbermaid.The good news is this box fits under my bed--barely, with not a fraction of an inch to spare--which the hard plastic boxes didn't.The bad news is that this ""box"" is basically a large canvas bag. Neither the bottom nor sides are rigid, so when I try to move it, everything inside shifts and flops around. This not only makes the box difficult to handle and move, but also messes up the things stored inside.I have an old soft vinyl underbed storage box that has two cardboard inserts that make the sides and bottoms rigid. I was hoping to replace it because it's ripped and no longer has a handle on the front, but it's more practical than this ""box"".And I don't understand why the ""cedar inserts"" are even there. They are just two tiny fabric covered pieces that don't have the typical cedar odor that I can tell."
3,Flimsy and overpriced,"As other reviewers have pointed out this storage item really needs a sturdy bottom in it. I mean as soon as you put something in it, in my case blankets, its just folds up and sags. I know it's meant to be placed under a bed (which is a good place for it so you can forget you even purchased this thing)but once again it really needs something to give it some strength. As far as the ""cedar inserts"" go I think they are referring to the three or four paper thin pieces of wood sewn into pouches around the inside edges. I thought Cedar was supposed to smell? Maybe there is something wrong with my nose? Anyway, I bought it, I'm stuck with it and thank goodness I changed my mind about purchasing two of these things! Oh and I gave it three stars, well I guess I was just feeling generous."
3,At least it's pretty,"Does not come with Cedar Inserts for the bottom, so it's difficult to slide in and out under the bed, it just ends up collapsing, but at least it's pretty to look at. It's practical, and has a zipper, which is good. I was going to use it to store my bed sheets, but since it's not very sturdy, it's just filled with my college text books under my bed and probably won't be pulled out from there at all. But at least it's pretty."
5,great underbed storage container,sides are firm enough to maintain some strength. The linen material means I have no worries about scratching my hardwood floors as I slide these in and out from under the bed. Highly recommended. The cedar inserts are a nice touch and of course are not expected to be a replacement for a cedar closet !
4,Fits under my bed,My bed is a moveable position bed. It is hard to find things that fit under it because the motor is really low. I can put this under lengthwise and it works great. Wish the top was not connected but still love it. Colors are just like the picture.
4,Exactly as Stated!,"Measurements were perfect!.. Quality is great.. I use it to store my bed linens under my bed since I don't have enough storage space in my house...Keeps my linens including duvet covers dust free, which is a PLUS PLUS PLUS!..A little pricey but worth the $$$$..I've owned 2 of them for about 1 and 1/2 years."
4,an embellishment to any knitter's library,"This is a wonderful book to buy, not to borrow. Whatever your level of knitting skill, you will find ideas and inspiration here, and LOTS of fun, striking, timeless embellishments (nothing overtly trendy here). I particularly liked the section on flowers, because most knitters will find that only crochet patterns for flowers are commonly available. With this book, you can take that plain old sweater or hat and make it a garden in spring, with nary a crochet hook.With a little imagination you can use these embellishments on every kind of garment and accessory. My only quibble is that I would have liked to see more examples of the embellishments used in finished items. There is a gallery section but it didn't seem adequate.All told, a good resource for every knitter. It's expensive but just think- you'll use it for your kids AND grandkids! This intermediate knitter is definitely buying, not borrowing."
4,Look over first...,"For some reason, whenever I saw this in a bookstore, it wasshrink-wrapped. Luckily I was able to check it out from thelibrary. Some of the designs were interesting, but quite a few of the designs did not photograph well, particularly the ones done in chenille yarns. It would be nice to see stitch details. The instructions are both in chart and written form for the most part, which is nice. She did have some really nice examples of what to do with the embellishments, but no patterns. As another reviewer said, where's a list?This book is overpriced by about a third, so buy used."
4,super cool embellishments!!!,"My sister gave me this super book as a birthday present, because I'm new at knitting, and it's groovy cool!!! it's easy to understand,it has great photographs, the stitches are incredible (specially the flower chapter)it has drawings of sugested ideas for the use of some of the stitches,it has an embroidery section, an i cord section with fantastic ideas (like making frog clousers for a sweater)etc.... in few words it's the best book available so buy it now."
3,Good embellishment ideas to dress up simple designs,"This book provided a number of ideas for embellishment on what might normally be relatively simple sweater designs. Although I found ideas that might be of use to me, I thought too much space was spent on hearts, leaves, and trees -- not of primary interest to me. I was very disappointed to find that this book was available only in soft cover. My opinion is that any reference book that will be handled numerous times should be available in hard cover. I would rather spend a few $$ more and get a book that will stand wear and tear. This book is a good addition to my library but not essential."
4,Lovely Ideas,"Like all of her books, this book repeats a lot of instructions found in her other publications."
3,embellishments,"Not as many flowers as I would have liked, but plenty of interesting borders and cordings. I have many of these patterns in other books."
4,Great experience,"My dog is allergic to wheat gluten. Every other food she has tried (including other high-quality brands) resulted in itching, vomiting and/or diarrhea. I got this food because of the limited ingredients. She has done very well on it. She doesn't scratch all the time, she doesn't vomit, etc. I only took one star off because I would like this food better if it contained probiotics. I supplement her food with a small amount of fish oil, a small amount of probiotics and a dog supplement called ""gas defense"" that helps with digestion. Still, I am sure that even without all these supplements she would do well on this food. If your dog has food allergies I recommend trying it. For reference: she is a 60-pound lab and she eats 1-cup of this twice a day. Also, she could probably stand to lose 2-3 pounds."
1,Do Not recommend for sensitive stomach,"I have a 1 year old Golden retriever who has a sensitive stomach. After trying Iams and Eukanuba Puppy we made the switch to the more quality California Natural Chicken and Rice Puppy formula which was great for him (firm stools and shiny coat). Now that he was ready to switch to adult formula (weighing in at 75 pounds now) I thought it sensible to choose the Adult Chicken and Rice formula by Calif. Nat. However, he has had an awful reaction even after gradually introducing the adult food with puppy food. He is itching a lot, ear infections, and chewing his paws, HORRIBLE gas, and loose stools. I do not recommend for sensitive stomach Golden Retrievers. We are going to try grain free options..."
5,You owe it to yourself to read this book.,"Crime and Punishment is: laced in great characters, a compelling drama, a page turner, at times laugh out loud funny, an opportunity to experience Dostoyevsky in classic form, thought provoking, unpretentious and an easy to read classic. You would be doing yourself a favor to read this book."
3,great but also convoluted,"My overriding response to this novel is that it contains much brilliance, but that it takes an inordinate amount of effort to extract that brilliance. It is exceedingly dense and almost impenetrable at times. I was also struck by a sense of redundancy - how many times do hear that someone is pale, lips trembling, face contorted, for example? Sounds a bit simplistic, but it's almost like a manuscript that needs more editing to distill its essence into a more manageable form.OTOH, characterization and plot are so compelling and so vivid that the novel really comes to life. And there are many many memorable passages. On the whole the novel has real power and weight. I was also surprised by some of the humor - Razumikhin in particular is a riot at times, almost steals the show.Glad I read it, but moderately disappointed."
2,Translation can spoil the book.,"Having read the Constance Garnet translation three times, I looked forward to a new version. The experience has been disappointing. The translation is awkward at best, without style, and jarring in spots. After spending a month on 125 pages, I gave up and went back to Constance, with relief. I can stand the ""whilst's"" if the writing flows."
3,Overrated...but a glad read,"While reading this I couldn't take it, i think it took me about 3 months to read becaue the translation just began to get on my last nerves and i was also trying to read Camus ""the plague"" but i quit to finish this beast. After finishing the novel i did feel a sense of accomplishment and you really look at the book to justify killing a woman for society well and at Russia at the time that Dosto wrote the novel so it is really everyone's opinion on the novel if you like it or not. To me it was a long novel with a poor translation with a good story and good idea."
3,You Need Stamina to Finish This One,"I appreciate this book, I really do. I purchased it in my quest to go back and read some of the classics that I never got to read coming up through high school and college (On the Road, Slaughterhouse Five, etc.) I have to say that this book requires more mental stamina than any other in recent memory. Read it because it's a cornerstone of a solid literary catalog, but I won't recommend it for any other reason."
3,Alright,But life's a bit short for books that are only 'alright'. I can't help thinking this book comes from a simpler world. One in which books like this can successfully compete for your attention. One with less books in it perhaps.
1,"Meditation Tool Kit: Forest, Sky, Water","We'll it's now apparent to me that Amazon is not prejudice against selling things that seriously lack in content and quality. This DVD consists of still shots of trees, water and other landscapes. If this is what you are looking for, in DVD format, you're search is. This DVD has nothing to do with meditation and proves that if you can package it, someone will sell it. Needless to say that I'm very disappointed that not only did I purchase a 4th grade quality video of natural settings, but it's falsely advertised as a meditation DVD and clearly it's boring shots of someone's camping trip."
4,Very Relaxing,"I have been searching for a relaxing DVD that I can sit back and disappear into. I've been disappointed on the four others that I have purchased because they move too quickly. This one doesn't rush through the images. It allows time to see the shadows, the gentle waves, the rippling leaves tickled by the wind. It just gives time to SEE. The music is gentle and not overwhelming. I have fibromyalgia and during flare-ups I want to watch something that is soothing and relaxing. This DVD is quite effective. It lost a star because I would have liked it to play on a continuous loop throughout and it won't do that. If you are looking for a peaceful and calming DVD to enjoy with a hot cup of tea then this is the one for you."
1,Gobbing Pogoing and Gratuitous Average Fiction,"This collection of short stories suffers from an identity crisis. Some of the stories are about punk, some of the stories are by punks, but the collection doesn't really come together. Further, most of the stories are poorly written, poorly edited (or not edited), and generally uninteresting run-of-the-mill stuff (""I was disenchanted, I formed a band, we played some gigs, we broke up, I have angst"" type stuff).This collection of punk short stories also includes a piece by Nick Blinko. His contribution, ""Punk Alice"", is not really a short story but is a dozen or so pages of doodles and scribblings. The art quality is not what you'd expect from looking at Blinko's albums (c.f., Rudimentary Peni), and the scribblings are mostly chess game notations. Blinko's piece is pretty much uninterestingAll in all, not worth the money."
3,"Not punk stories at all, but not really bad stories either.","Okay, I bought this book because I'm a punk and I thought that this would be highly entertaining to me...wrong. The only story I even like din here was the one by Poppy Z. Brite and it's a gothic story. The stories aren't bad at all they're just not what they say they are. xXx"
5,Charming,"Both of these guys had taken a long hiatus since their heyday, the late 20s/early 30s. By the late 60s, Hines was an acknowledged immortal, Venuti was largely forgotten, and this kind of music sounded old fashioned. Venuti made a big splash at a jazz festival in the late 60s, and Hines was coaxed out of retirement to make this album with him five years later. Great musicianship (and tunes) beat time and ""crow jim"". A happier time, remembering another happier time. Doesn't seem to have original liner notes: as I recall, when the refreshments ran out, Venuti said something like, ""Let's blow this joint"", and they did."
3,Afghans Galore!,"I bought this book for one pattern in particular that I was really excited for. It's a beautiful counterpane afghan with floral appliqué that I am making for a couple of friends who are getting married this summer. The pattern is written beautifully, the photographs are clear, and there was even one or two other projects in the book I might consider making. It only gets three stars from me because I found the patterns to be extremely dated. I'm glad I bought it, though. And PS, it's out of print."
1,not for MY home,"Loved this author's hats, and her embellishments reference book is quite good (though did she have to include such things as k1p1 and k2p2 ribbing???), but this book goes beyond cute and fun and whimsical into weird and goofy and gaudy. Not one thing that shouted ""make me"" in the whole collection."
5,best 60 cent ball money can buy,This ball seems to get more distance and has more control than a pro v-1.... yet even with shipping it costs about 60 cents a ball...the only negative is that they tend to get cut up after about 36 holes but for me that is a non issue because I almost always lose them before than.... in fact in two seasons I have had to throw out only 2 balls.
4,Good Balls for Beginners and Average Players,"I have recently picked up the game of golf, and I love it. I bought these balls mainly because of the price. I tested them out on 9 holes this past weekend, and they worked well. I lost a couple of balls, but was not so concerned based on the cost. I would recommend these balls to anyone starting out or anyone not wishing to break the bank buying balls."
2,Won't last,"I used to think all balls were alike (that's what she said), but once I started playing regularly and felt the drive (pun) to improve, I ditched the Intechs, Top Flites and Pinnacles and started filling my bag with real performance golf balls. For golfers who get out on the course once and a while to whack it around and plan on losing a few, these are the bang-for-your-buck champion. But players looking to improve should consider buying mid-level recycled balls at near-mint condition (AAAAA or AAAA -- I recommend Taylormade Burners in that price range). These balls, as many have said, will scuff so quickly that you'll end up playing more than half the box in a round anyway; get a ball that will hold up and give you some results (if you feel you the need, of course). Otherwise, go for these and enjoy a good round with your friends -- that's what it all comes down to anyway, regardless of your handicap or what's in your bag."
2,dissappointed in quality of golf balls.,I WAS DISSAPPOINTED IN THE QUALITY OF THE GOLF BALLS COMPARED TO PREVIOUS INTECH BETA TI BALLS. SEEMS THEY HAD A QUALITY PROBLEM ON PREVIOUS LOTS AND THESE BALLS WERE SOME OF THE PREVIOUS LOT. THEY BOUNCED ABOUT 12 INCHES BELOW PREVIOUS BALLS WHEN DROPPED FROM EYE LEVEL. BOTH BOXES EXPERIENCED THE SAME PROBLEM. VERY DISSAPPOINTED.
