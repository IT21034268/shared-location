2,"Fun at first, junk not long after","I don't know if any of you owners noticed this, but right where the barrel leaks grit, right underneath, there is a funnel that directs the sticky, gritty sluice straight toward the cheap plastic reduction gear mounted to the motor. Planned obsolescence courtesy of the great state of China. Take precautions if you want this to last a little longer than a few months. a) buy something more expensive and larger (this model only holds a half pound of pebbles) b) buy something with higher durability reviews and including an offset between where the barrel might leak and where the sensitive motor, gears and rubber bands turn c) if you must have this, put a fine cloth filter over the air intake on top and below where the motor gears are"
2,Only good once,"I bought this for my 7 year old daughter, and at first it was OK. It is EXTREMELY loud, and it does take a long time (but that helps to teach patience to kids!) but it was worth the wait. Our problem was when it came down to starting a second batch of rocks, the plastic barrel wore down in spots from the tumbling rocks and the water & grit leaked through! So unless you have a powered outdoor shed and only want to use it once, I would NOT recommend this product. We're buying a more expensive, heavy-duty one next time!"
1,Doesn't last,"Our children (5 and 8) enjoyed our first process of rock collecting and tumbling even though it does take time and it is noisy(we put it in the basement so that helped). However, after our 2nd batch of rocks, we no longer have a rock tumbler. The entire red drum is destroyed and has several holes. My husband rigged it so we could at least make it through the last step of polishing but it was such a mess. Definitely don't waste your money on this one...look for one with a sturdier drum."
1,"nice idea, but disappoints","My boys were excited to polish the rocks they are always picking up. But it takes a very long time, and requires daily attention over weeks. You have to change the grain of the polishing sand 3 times. The barrel leaks. The axel wore out before even one batch was done. It could be very educational, but a toy must maintain the kids' interest in order to educate them. Most kids do not have the patience for a product like this."
3,rock tumbler,"I got this toy for my sons 8th birthday. He loves every part of it accept for the fact it takes nearly a month for one batch of rocks to be polished. I did expect it to take some time but I was thinking more like a couple days. However, he is learning a lesson on patience!"
2,Money!,"i got this item for my 13th b-day and it was not what i expexted, this item is good if you are rich, i put some rocks in and turned it on, you had to let ti go for like a month almost but i never got to finish it becase it needed to be pluged in and it was running up the electricity bill and was costing us more money than it was worth so my mom made me unplug it. even though the rocks came out smother then they were when i put then in even though they were not in for the whole time they were also not the right shape to put it on a necles or the rings that they give you and when you do finaly get then on they fall of in like 2 days cuz the glue was not strong enough~ botton line i think you should not waste your time or money on this item~"
1,A very long month........,"This rock tumbler was a complete waste of money and time. Yes time.....no where on the box does it say you need a full month to complete the tumbling process. It is loud and anoying and I could hear clear on the other side of the house. After anticipating great results we were extremely disappointed. The rock came out smoother yes......but dull, dull, dull. If you child loves rocks so much like my child go buy a bag of pre-polished rocks for about $5 somewhere."
1,Stopped working after a couple weeks of tumbling,"After a couple weeks (of a fairly loud hum that made me think the dishwasher was running ALL the time), the bucket stopped turning. A sticky residue built up and the little wheel rotated, but the bucket wouldn't stay in the groove and turn. Returned it - looking for a better one."
1,Buy a different brand,"I bought this rock tumbler for my 6-year old daughter, who is very scientific minded. She understood the lengthy process and happily helped me to prepare the tumbler for the first set of rocks. We had a few initial problems with leaks, but like many others, rectified that with a smear of vaseline.The major problem, however, is that the plastic barrel started to wear away before the end of the medium-grit cycle, leaving several holes in the barrel, through which all the water leaked.It is very disappointing that we are not able to complete the polish cycle with this tumbler. Despite the reasonable price, you would expect the product to at least last to complete one set of rocks! Definite waste of money."
3,Educational but SLOW and NOISY,"My daughter got this for Christmas. We had no idea it takes nearly a month from start to finish to get polished stones, but I suppose it's a good lesson in patience for a 10 year old. It does not say anything on the box about the wait period, or the fact that the noisy tumbler must be running constantly for the entire time. Fortunately, we have a basement where the tumbler is humming away while not disturbing anyone. I recommend placing the tumbler in the box top it comes in, to avoid ""traveling"" while the motor runs.All in all, the toy is certainly educational, but it takes a LOOOONG time to get results, and is not for folks who live in close quarters."
4,Didn't last :(,"We bought this tumbler for our 8 year old son for Christmas 2002. It is really great to watch how the rocks transform! However, we only got 1 complete cycle out of it before it wore out. We started a second cycle, and about halfway through, the plastic tumbler started leaking..the friction of the tumbling rocks wore holes in the plastic! If we had to do it over again, we'd spend a bit more and get a really heavy duty tumbler (they aren't that much more expensive)."
1,Disapointment,"i got a rock tumbler years ago and we tried and tried to get it to work. in the end, we ran out of parts. it took us years to find a refill kit, but i got one for christmas this year. I was excited to finally use my tumbler, but the box had absolutely no directions. why would a product like that not have directions? i can't believe the company would do something that senseless."
2,Inferior product,"Container cracked after about 3 weeks, before even completing the first batch. Additionally, no fine grit was included in the package. I would not suggest purchase of this item."
1,Rocks wear hole in plastic.,"This product is made of very cheap plastic, it does leak through the lid when you first use it but we were able to use plumbing tape to seal most of that leaking. Before the first batch of rocks was done though, the rocks wore right through the barrel itself. It is no longer usable."
2,takes too long,My anxious son wanted to see the final product but it took over 2 weeks to complete. It was way too long for a 6 year old to wait. The final product was beautiful but several steps must be taken to get there.
1,Buy a better kit,"We purchased one, exchanged it because the box did not contain all the parts, then the motor from the second box did not work at all. The manufacturer obviously has little or no quality control."
1,Do Not Purchase,"This product is poorly made. The canister leaks which is a potential fire hazard as it's supposed to sit on an electronic tumbler. Also, the tumbler machine didn't start and although the instructions say you should start it by hand as soon as you put the canister in it stops. I tried various rock weights and nothing works. For $40 I would expect something better."
4,Educational fun,"I bought the rock tumbler, refill kit and book about rocks for my 6 year old. He loves collecting rocks so it was good to buy the book to show him how many different kinds of rock there are and how rock formations are created. There are several steps to polishing the rocks which a 6 year old doesn't have patience for but I did involve my son in each step and with the help of the book, explained how the rock tumbler was speeding up a process that otherwise takes decade's in nature. The ability to create jewelry with the finished polished semi precious gems was a fun activity to do together. My son gave some away as gifts that he was proud to create."
4,800 vs 760,"I have been doing a lot of research to decide between 760 and 800. It turns out that 800 comes with features that I cannot use while driving, such as MP3 and picture viewer. It does come with battery which I think is good to have.The main difference that 760 has and 800 doesn't is 760 announce the name of street that you turn into. This is a absolutely must have feature in my view. I bought 760 in Feb, 2006 and have been loving it ever since."
1,Great until it BREAKS!!!!!,"Overall my initial impression as my first gps was that this was a great product. Easy to use and very intuitive.HOWEVER.... The battery is horrible and after the first month of use would not hold any charge for more than a few hours, I thought this was Ok since it could be run off of the car ac adapter, but I was SOOOO wrong.By the fourth month of use I found that the system would constantly lock up, or freeze while aquiring signal. Now it is functional only as a paper weight. None of the buttons work, Including the Power. The systems turns on as soon as it is connected to either the AC adapter or charger and cannot be turned off at all, and Now freezes on the Magellan logo untill the battery dies. Seriously save yourself the money and buy another GPS with a decent review, or a good old fashioned paper map. I'm glad this was given to me as a gift, otherwise I'd be furious at the lack of customer suppot from Magellan.My reccomendation - AVOID PURCASING A MAGELLAN PRODUCT."
1,As bad as it gets,"Well, probably we should start with positive:-- good construction - not a cheap plastic casing-- buttons - in case you don't want to use touch screen-- sound is good, epecially if you connect it to your audio systemBad-- predictive driving sucks - system always thinks that you are going straight and it takes 20 seconds for GPS to realize that you've just turned-- short distance routing sucks -- try to compare total minimal distance over GPS and any web map engine ( mapquest, google maps, yahoo maps, etc)-- arror button is to sensetive -- jumpt over several menu items-- !!! the most annoying feature !!! YOU CAN""T PLAY YOUR MP3 and see where you are going at the same time.YOU ARE EITHER DRIVING OR LISTENING TO THE MUSICWHAT A DESIGN !!!and they advertize that it has an MP3 player !!!???i can continue on, so if you have time/money to waste - SURE buy this GPS...This unit is going where it came from...."
1,"No Mac Support, No Dice","Having grown up with Rand McNally maps on seemingly all my classroom walls, in the family Atlas, etc,. I was predisposed to like the Magellan GPS system. However, the lack of even the slightest intention to support the lonely but (from what I can gather) creative and pro-technology 2.5% of us that use Mac's, back it went. I guess those guys are still living in the world of the classroom wall, despite their venture in GPS land. Tom Tom and/or Garmin here I come!"
2,Fairly Lame Attempt to compete with Garmin Nuvi,"Just the same device with a couple of new tricks. The internal battery is a nice feature. If your looking for a multimedia gps, you must check out the Garmin Nuvi. It is half the size of the 800 and weighs half as much, about the size of a deck of playing cards. Garmin's mp3 is integrated with the gps so it mutes the mp3 when giving a voice comand, just like a built in system. The Garmin unit is $150 less expensive than the bulky roadmate. Also, you can add real time traffic updates to the Garmin unit with an antenna and a subscription.The Garmin Nuvi is also a multi language translator that can help you travel in strange lands. With their guidebook feature, you will know all the sights to see and places to stay. All in a package about the size of a deck of playing cards. Don't waste your money on the Magellan. Its already obsolete."
4,good gps,Very good at getting from point a to point b. POI database seems to be insufficent. Have not used the mp3 player or picture viewer functions. It is a much better value than some others in its class.
4,Works Great,"I just purchased this unit based on the reviews of the 700 model. I immediately upgraded to the 2.12 firmware prior to use. This is the first GPS system that I have owned and had no trouble understanding how to use it. I was actually quite surprised at how accurate it was... when the unit alerted me to turn I was within feet of the actual turn (it made me aware where I needed to turn prior to that obviously). As an additional test, I did not follow the directions it provided me and it quickly calculated a new route and re-routed me. After turning the unit on, I obtained a strong GPS signal within 2 minutes."
1,You get what you pay for....,"Something is very wrong with my system. Is it online and cheap because it's a reject?It gives me wrong directions, says that addresses don't exist, gives me altogether wrong addresses for the ""Points of Interests"", the battery doesn't seem to charge properly.I'm disappointed.I've had 2 other Magellens from a reputable brick and shop and didn't have these problems.In addition (warning), the 800 isn't compatible with any of the bases. The window suction is the only mounting option, which is REALLY annoying."
1,do not buy,"horrible unit. The processor is very slow, and always seems to be processing data when you need to make a turn.The maps are oudated and Mageelan will not do anything to help. New maps are going on sale in APril 05 2007, and will cost current owners at least $100. Customer service's response (which is from an Indian, with very poor english skills) is that we are sorry about your problems, but you can remedy it in April of 2007, with a small of $100.The unit has no idea what it is doing in the boston,ma, area. None of the ""new"" road changes are in the system. THe system is also highly inaccurate in the Hartford, CT., area.As for P.O.I. it misses all of the major ones. It does not list the rest areas or gas stations on major highways I-84, I-90, CT-15, NY-15 etc."
1,"Breaks often, Horrible Customer service from Magellan","I bought this version and it has broken twice since. The original one I bought would not turn on and it took them more than a month to replace it with a different one which then broke with the same problem again.. I put in a customer service request and they still haven't responded yet. (its been about a week) Good when its working, but not worth its defective hardware and horrendous customer service"
5,Magellan Roadmate 800,"This unit works as advertised, however it was rather slow to aquire a good signal with it's pop-up internal antenna. I purchased the optional external antenna subsequently, and now it works like gangbusters.I am quite satisfied with it and would not hesitate to reccomend it to others. It' portability to other vehicles is a big plus.S. Winston..."
2,"Functional, but not great.","This works fine, and is OK to use, but I have had some other GPS map finders in rental cars that are spectacular by comparison. I got this because AAA sells them, but in all I am disappointed."
2,Magellan support is useless.,Magellan RoadMate 800 Portable GPS NavigatorThe unit works well and is usually accurate and reroutes you quickly enough. Magellan map updates are way behind and impossible to use. I purchased the latest update from them when it became available in the 4th quarter 2007 and the update is dated 3rd quarter 2006 - plus now that installation has failed multiple times- the unit is useless since it's hard drive was altered during the process. Magellan tech support is totally useless. I would choose a unit easier to update because you are completely on your own when you encounter problems. I will not buy a magellan again.
2,not durable,At the recommendation of a friend we both bought a Magellan RoadMate 800 GPS primarily for getting local driving directions. The GPS worked well for me in providing the information I needed at the time. But I soon noticed that the battery life begun to drop from about 30 minutes to 5-10 minutes when it was connected to the car charger. Last month the GPS became unchangeable (the charging light does not come on and the GPS cannot be turned on). This happens in less than 6 months of purchase. I checked on Magellan warrantee services and found they need the original receipt which I no longer have for any warrantee work. Basically I spent $700 plus taxes and realized that I enjoyed a little toy for a few months. I went back and checked with my friend who bought the GPS 3 weeks later than me and was told that his GPS was broken even before mine. We have both gave up on this. I am going to buy a different brand next time.
2,Poor to very poor maps,This is an easy to use GPS system and could have been good to excellent except for the fact that the map that comes with it is at least 4 years old. I tried to find out about updates but Magellan does not answer there customer service Email. So I called them and they said they plan to update their units every 18 months. I have had mine longer and it was out dated the moment I used it.In checking out map update availability of several other Magellan units I found that none that I checked had an available update. No wonder they don't answer their customer service Emails.Look into Garmin. They update every unit every month.
1,Don't Be Fooled!,"They should name this product ""Design Blunder for the Ages."" The GPS portion of the Magellan 800 works well, a slight improvement over the 700 series.With the Magellan 800 Roadmate, you also get a MP3 player. But check this out, you can't play music and get directions at the same time. It is either... or. So if you're lost, you have to switch over to GPS and the music is gone, and if you want to listen to music, you select the song, then the screen goes blank and GPS dissapears. According to the tech guys at Magellan, it was designed that way! How dumb is that?So essentially you are paying an addition $200 - $300 over the Roadmate 700 for an expensive mp3 player that outweighs an ipod by almost a pound. Does this make sense to anyone? I am returning this product immediatly for a refund."
1,BUYER BEWARE,I bought this GPS for less then a year and I had to call Tech support in India and there only advice was to send it back. Which I did twice. Everytime the unit was found with some another problem. Now it does not save my address book. I can't even back it up. I even updated the firmware and nothing. I must of bought a lemon but Magellan did not grant me another upgrade or even a new GPS. Now the warrentee expired and I don't want to spend a dime with this unit. I just sold it for $100. I bought a Garmin 680 from Amazon. Great Price!! Stay away from Magellan.
1,Do NOT buy Magellan products. I did and NEVER will again!,"If you are expecting post-sale support, including warranty, from Magellan, don't! It is non-existent!!! It is horrible. All you get is empty promises (read lies). Magellan does not stand behind its (expensive) products.Lesson learned. I'm throwing this Magellan unit in the garbage. I will NEVER buy or use another Magellan product even they were to give it away for free. I will vote with my money and spend it on something else like GARMIN."
1,Forget about support after purchase,"The product is actually very good, but the warranty support is non-existant. I thought I was doing a good thing and purchsed a 3 year extended warranty directly from Magellan. The net is 7 weeks after intially reporting that my windshield mount had broken - I am still waiting for a new one. Lots of excuses, emtpy promises for return phone calls and lots and lost of excuses why the part was not yet shipped. Consider yourself forewarned if you have a post sale problem with a Magellan product. I wasted my money on the warranty."
2,Magellan ROADMATE 800 North America,"This unit has worked well since I bought it about six months ago. However, it does seem to have some heat related problems and shut down several times on a trip in 90 degree plus weather. Last week I tried to unlock the international maps and the web site would not allow orders. Magellan now tells me that this problem should be fixed by the end of September. Can you beat that. At least 5 weeks with no capability to unlock international maps.I bought a Garmin nuvi 370 that comes with European maps installed for $ 425.00. The maps alone, if you could get them, are $ 250.00 from Magellan. Based on customer service I cannot recommend Magellan products."
2,Watch Out,"I Purchased the Magellan RoadMate800 in January 2006. After six months the power pin which is used to connect the recharge adapter to the unit failed. The unit was sent in for repair and returned. Now one year later, once again the power pin connection failed. This time however, the product is no longer under warranty and Magellan wants to charge for the repair. Two friends own the same 800 model and have experienced the same power pin problem. This is an obvious flaw in the manufacture of the product which Magellan refuses to deal with equitably. Recently Megellan formerly a subsidiary of Thames Corporporation was bought out by Shah Capital Partners, LP, Ajay Shah, Managing Director headquartered in Santa Clara, CA. The unit itself works well and is as accurate as any units out there, however, the power pin problem is a major flaw which would not allow you to recharge your batteries."
3,"Unit is a good value, technical support is terrible.","The unit is a good value and well designed. If you need to call Magellan for anything, watch out. You'll spend a long time on the phone with someone who knows nothing about your unit. I wish the website had all the questions and steps that they were going to ask you to take. Even their sales department is clueless.I bought the unit used. It works pretty well most of the time. I bought a traffic kit, and it won't work. The tech support people are useless. The unit says that there is no traffic kit, but the tech support people keep sending me through the same menus (which they don't even know what options are on the menus), and then tell me to go for a drive and hope it starts working."
5,Cute Clifford DVD,"This DVD is split in to two segments. The first half has stories in which Clifford and his freinds either pretend to be, think they are, or act like royalty; they are: Clifford the Pirate King * Princess Cleo * King Mac * Flood of Imagination. They're solid stories and mainly deal with including others, being kind, and being imaginative. The second half of the DVD is a very nice series of stories only one of which has anything to do with Valentines day. They are Cleo's Valentine Surprise * Big Hearted t-Bone * Wedding Bell Blues * Special T-Bone. Besides the Valentine story the other stories deal with keeping your word, accepting change, and discovering the best about yourself. They're very nice."
3,"Disappointing, unless you are in the narrow target audience","Spring Into Technical Writing covers many of the basic rules of good technical writing well, but I couldn't help coming away disappointed. The problem is that the book is only appropriate for a very narrow audience: those who already have experience creating technical documents but are quite clueless on how to do so properly. I consider myself a reasonably good technical writer, though I have little experience; the book provided a good summary of what one should know, but I didn't learn much that wasn't already obvious to me. On the other hand, if you have no idea how to create a long technical document, the book doesn't provide enough information to make you feel like you could tackle the task with competence.In other words, if you are part of the audience I describe, you will find the book very useful. If not, I recommend looking elsewhere."
4,"Simple and direct, easy reading!","Before starting my master thesis, the words ""technical writing"" used to have a fear effect on me. Then I found this book and it became easier. It's is a simple, not exhaustive book. If you want something more complete is better to chose another one but this gave me the boost I needed to start my writing process."
1,Disappointed,"Technical Writing for Engineers and Scientists is chalk full of theory and has little to no practical value. This book will not teach you how to properly format an engineering report. I wish I had my money back. It will not teach you about paragraph spacing, numbering, fonts, letter size, or how to place units into a paragraph as opposed to a chart."
1,Unnecessary budget compilation,This was once the only Steve Goodman CD available. Tracks from his first two albums were tossed together for this budget bin release. The Buddha remasters ofSteve GoodmanandSomebody Else's Troubleshave rendered this disc expendable.
5,A Folk Classic,"City of New Orleans is the most American, perfectly crafted folk song I know. It has the poetry of the words and music moving the song forward."
5,Brings back many memories of riding the City of New Orleans!,"This song is one of my favorites! Possibly because I have taken The City of New Orleans many timesfrom Chicago to Carbondale, Illinois. Especially the times that I had fun talking with the crew --they teased me alot as my then husband worked for the Illinois Central. So the song has a veryspecial place in my memory!And while the old train has disappeared, Amtrak still has a train from New Orleans to Chicagothat is also named the City of New Orleans!"
5,Steve Goodman City of New Orleans,"I owned this album years ago and sold it. Kicked myself (you know where). If you are a Steve Goodman fan, must have. Every song is great."
3,Funny if you don't have Take it like a man...,"Much the samematerial as ""Take it like a man"" (which was hillarious) with less energy, poor audio quality, and poor video quality...Still, very funny though."
2,bad audio quality,"audio quality is pretty bad. i would recommend to go for ""Take It Like a Man"" - much better..."
1,Lisa Lampanelli is an A Hole,"This is an extraordinarily nasty woman and I have no idea who in this world would pay even a single penny to see her. I watch Celebrity Apprentice and she makes my stomach turn each time she opens her mouth. She thinks she's a genius. Yet, she's nothing more than an oversized loud mouth with an overly glorified view of herself. I can't wait until the Donald sends her and her big mouth packing. What a LOSER!"
1,never recieved my order,"I never recieved my order and have to say that i am very dissapointed when I tried to contact customer service there was no way to let them know I hadnt received it , I will not be using this comany or service ever again and more so I plan to let all my friends and co workers and family know."
1,"Not a Queen, Just REALLY Mean","In my search for videotapes or DVDs of female standup comics, I came across this listing and decided to order the tape. I thought that ""mean"" would be somewhat edgy (like Chris Rock or George Carlin) but with a point of view. I was extremely disappointed with Ms. Lampanelli's standup routine.Within the first ten minutes, I had had enough of Ms. Lampanelli's profanities and insults to every possible age group, race etc. I therefore did the only thing I could think of ... I threw it in the garbage. With so many other genuinely funny comics out there just waiting for their chance for a national and international audience, I am at a loss as to why Lisa Lampanelli has been granted virtual shelf-space on Amazon to flog her brand of insult humour. Don't touch this with a ten-foot pole. (I tried to give it no stars at all, but apparently 1 star is the lowest you can go in these reviews.)"
5,Power shot,Works Great in my rifle 1200 fps accurate and powerful . I am trying many different pellets and will continue to keep these in my make shift arsenal.
5,Very accurate and packs a punch...,"I just purchased a .177 cal. Gamo Big Cat 1250. I used the Gamo Rocket .177 cal to sight the scope and adjust the trigger pull. I must say that I'm impressed with the accuracy and penetration of these pellets. I was able to shoot a 2"" grouping at 20 yds. while adjusting the scope and trigger pull. These pellets were able to completely penetrate a 1"" X 4"" ceder fence while shooting a paper target and penetrated the same fence 1/4"" while shooting through cans of tuna and salmon. Can't wait to try them out on farm varmits. No doubt that they will be a one shot kill pellet on small pests and rodents. With the right shot placement they will be able to down larger predators/pests (coyotes, feral pigs, etc.) with one shot. Gamo produces excellent adult air rifles/pistos and the ammo to go along with them Just ordered five more tins of the Gamo Rocket .177 cal. pellets. Highly recommend."
1,"slow, inacurate, powerless","this prouduct was very inacurate,slow and power less. i was shooting from less the 25 feet and still couldnt hit a hedge apple. red fire pellets are much more accurate and presise and awsome for hunting"
4,good as any,"There pellets and not much eles to say. Would recommend, I have not had any fliers or jums and there only as accurate has the gun and the shooter."
5,penetration,"if you want penetration you will not find better then these, accuracy is good but not great. there cool to have around for when a friend says ""i bet it wont go through that"" load one of these and watch their jaw drop!"
2,Way over rated.,i bought these pellets for my 1200 fps break barrel. these pellets for one are sooo inaccurate. i actually feel bad about my self as a shooter with them. i can usually shot a bird out of mid air but i cant shoot a grapefruit from a hundred yards with these. they are heavy and i feel like im going to destroy my rifling using these pellets. they are over sized and way to heavy. they advertise their product as being maximum shock but as i said before about the grapefruit i either hit it or dont know if i do because i dont see it moving or falling out of the tree. just beware they are way over priced and way over rated.
3,Hell Island,"I am very interested in WWII history in general, and Malta in particular, but this book was a bit disappointing. It is thoroughly researched, in terms of ""Capt xxx of Squadron xx shot down Lt Werner Schmidt of JG87 at 4:45pm"" etc, but as a pilot, I don't think the author knows much about aircraft, so the narrative has more of a ""daily newspaper"" tone than an aviation history tone. I would have liked to read more about actual aircraft operations, written by an expert.Also, by the way, it's not really specifically only about Canadian pilots, which is OK with me, and the title 'Hell Island' is unfortunate: my Maltese friends were somewhat offended."
2,Big Daddy Ottoman,"This chair is sold with the title ""Big Daddy"" and is supposed to be oversized, blah, blah, blah. The box said nothing about the above and frankly, I think it is a regular size Adirondack Chair that they are charging extra money for. The foot rest is a pain to get in or out so I guess you just have to leave it and not mess with it once you get there. I would say I paid about $100 too much for this chair, but now I see it is on sale for $139, which is a much fairer price for what it is. Nothing fancy as far as I can tell..."
1,Misleading,Wish I had read the reviews before I ordered this Christmas gift for my son. Why would it occur to me that it was in French?????
1,this was a big mistake,THIS BOOK IS WRITTEN IN FRENCHand the Note on the Amazon sales pageis so small and inconspicuousthat I missed it when orderingso I returned it and got dockedA LOT OF MONEYbecause it was my mistakeBUYER BEWARE
1,Also got the French book by mistake - twice !,Very annoying. Looks completely like an English book from the description. When it showed up in French and I went through the automated process to return it (including noting on the comments that the book was in French and I don't read French)....they shipped me another French book.Geez.you would think they could have figured this out by now....
2,Dissappointed,"I've had this coin purse not even 2 months now, and I've only used it about 7 times. Unfortunately, the ZIPPER broke already! I couldn't believe it."
1,Misrepresented,"Only the front of the bag is actually beaded, and the quality poor. The original price should have been $5 or fewer, to be reasonable. This would make a better toy for a little girl than an actual accessory."
3,Smaller than described...,"The craftmanship on this item was very nice, but I bought it based on the measurements of 4.5"" x 5.5"" and the bag I received was only 4"" x 5"" - VERY disappointing because I wanted to use it for a tarot deck, and had measured my cards and they would have fit with the extra 0.5"" that the description had claimed was the size. They do not fit with just 4x5"""
5,Convient and classy,This little purse carries all you need when you're all dressed up and don't want to lug around a regular size bag.
3,cheap but ok,"It was very inexpensive which is fine, since it is for a teenager who will probably lose it. Thanks"
1,Totally Dissapointed,"This purse is a ridiculous size. It is for a miniture doll and even the length of the strop is useless. In fact, I am really not certain what this would be used for. Quality is also very cheap. Thrown out money."
4,down a different road...,"If you've read my previous review on ""Ascendance"" you'll know It was a recomended read, but the over all feel of that book kinda of left you wanting more...With ""Transcendence"" RAS has stoked up the fire and we've got new characters and stories and for the most part, it's alot better than the first book in my opinion. The way RAS brings some of the new characters into the story is great and you will definately love some of the other characters. This deviation from the series is most welcome and I can't wait for the final book...now.A definate read and one of the better releases thus far in the ""DeamonWars"" saga...Justice Delivered"
2,Pretty not practical,This platter is indeed hand made and is pretty but the craftsmanship isn't great. It was warped so it rocked when in a flat surface and did not have the holes for hanging. It was not glazed or sealed so it had an uneven flat color in spots and clearly could not be used for food. It's distortions prevented its display so I returned it. Gave it 2 stars because it was clearly hand made and signed which are its best features
3,Disappointing performance practice,"Although this album does not differ from any other Chanticleer album in its gorgeous sound, the performances of Palestrina and Josquin are...well, boring. Contrary to popular belief, this music was not to be done at a snail's pace. The Josquin Ave Maria is one of the most beautiful motets ever written and is a clear example of his imitative writing and expression of the text. This performance is so slow however, the piece become a series of nice dissonances and sonorities rather than anything reflecting Josquin's humanistic homage to the Virgin Mary."
4,Marvelous sound,"This recording wraps you up in a gorgeous sonority, and I'm only listening in stereo. I can't wait to hear it when I fill out my speaker ensemble."
3,diamonds on wheels,the movie is real good but the condition of the tape and clam shell is not as i was told tape shutters while running and it is not because of my vcr it is brand new and no other movies iplay does that.the clam shell is in very bad shape. i am going to send it back for a full refund thank you james ewell
5,Great Game,"Bought this for my 7 year old proto-astronaut... she loves it, she learns from it, and thanks to her lucky dice rolling, she usually beats me. Great game for kids interested in space/astronomy."
2,A virtuoso poorly recorded,"Her Technique is top-notch and the song selection is very good. However, the downloadable mp3s are poorly recorded or compressed. The bass distorts in a number of the songs. Perhaps the mp3 conversion was poor, but recording classical guitar is tough and great care should be taken to ensure that bass notes are not saturating the mix."
1,Brain Drain Affects Strategy Guides As Well.,"Looking back at Brady Games CIV 2 Strategy guide of 300 pages as well asPrimas 355 page guide and one starts to wonder what the hell happened starting with Civ 3??? If the authors arent up to the job, then they should not be writing. If the companies think to grinch us with these magazine length strategy guides then they better rethink their careers. It used to be the gaming community use to produce dedicated writers who gave you a strategy guide the size of textbooks, now they give you Cliff Notes. Yes paper went up and so did everything else. So add a couple of bucks and see if it goes unbought. Certainly these poor pseudo manuals aint gonna do it. All it is is saying the same thing as the manual while changing the format around, thats all."
4,I disagree,"I disagree with the earlier reviews. I read them before purchasing, but for some reason decided to buy the book anyway. Much to my surprise, it was full of strategic hints that I've found very helpful to game play. It's well written, and has information that I believe should have been included in the game manual. In any case, I'm very pleased with it, and recommend it to other players."
3,Civilization IV Official Strategy Guide (Official Strategy Guides (Bradygames)),From what I have read and reviewed...just OK
2,Don't waste your money,This book was a complete disappointment compared to the strategy guides from previous Civ games. Almost half of info in the book can be obtained from the Civlopedia. There are some game strategies included that can be usefull but there is no game mechanic information. The bigest items missing are the Combat mechanics (of which there is NONE) and the customization information (NONE also) on how to customize the game or make maps using the included map maker. This book is basicly a print version of the Civlopedia.
3,Marginally useful,"This book is better than the manual that comes with the game, and the lists of units, cultures, improvements, etc. are easier to navigate. That's where the good points end. Like the manual, there is no index. The strategy and game basics sections will add no value for anyone who has played Civ 3 or read the pre-release reviews on the furums. If you are completely new to the Civilization series, this will get you a bit further than the manual. Otherwise, save your money."
2,Fire the editor!,"Oh my good god, this book is so full of typos and typesetting errors it's physically hard to believe. Nevertheless, there is some good information here. The strategy info is marginal, nothing eye-opening if you've played games much. The crunchy bits like the tables of units and improvements are nice to have. In the end, I would probably recommend you skip this guide just to punish Brady for allowing it out the door in such primordial condition. You can always get the same information (and way more besides) on fan sites like Apolyton or CivFanatics."
2,Little more than a reprint of the game's online help,"I expect a guide like this to pick up where the instruction manual leaves off. But this book spends 3/4 of its pages just reproducing what is already included with the book's online and printed help. The rest provides some very abstract ideas on strategy. It does not tell you what units or buildings to build or when to build them. Civ 4 is a great game, but you won't get much here. Stick to the game's manual and visit some of the fan sites for helpful hints."
2,Low on content and cheap to boot!,"I'll agree with other reviewers that the content doesn't provide much supplemental information, but I confess a preference for hard copy documentation when I'm using software. It's the booklover in me, plus the fact that I like to look at the manual and the game I'm playing at the same time.My complaint with this book is that it is cheaply produced and difficult to read. I've grown used to the 4-color Prima guides. They are excelently laid out and easy on the eye. The Civ IV guide, however, is B&W; and the font size is 9 at best. Unless you have great vision, you'll find yorself wanting to use a magnifier. It's fascinating. The Prima Sims2 Nightlife manual has 224 pages, all 4-color, and is a pleasure to read. The Brady Civ IV manual has 188 B&W; pages and is a complete pain to peruse. Both have list prices of $19.99. One guess which company is delivering the best value."
1,CIV IV Book,"This book is virtually useless. I have played all versions of CIV and bought the guides for them. Most of the information contained in this book is in the user documentation. To me, it seems the book was written by someone who never played the game. Don't waste your money."
5,"Love, laughter and life in the golden years","Babette Williams has done us all a favor. She let us know it was alright to give life and love a go in her later years. This book is refreshing, funny and honest.How often do we give new things and people a chance? Dancing in High Cotton offers a lot of insights and will dance away with your heart. A perfect read and a must give gift for anyone who is young at heart."
5,One of the Best Short Story Collections I have Ever Read,"By far, one of the best short story collections I have ever read. The stories in Incantations are touching without suffering from trite and cliche language, themes, or characters as in Chitra B. Divakaruni's, ARRANGED MARRIAGE. Appachana's prose is not expository like Divakaruni's, but rather, immensely touching while also moving the narrative forward. She deals with the social and personal predicaments of Indian women, but not in a common way. Appachana's best stories are ""Incantations"" and ""My Only Gods,"" although all of the stories are excellent, and they really make the reader think about what the author is saying. You cannot come away feeling something for these characters. I have been waiting for ages for a new work from this author, and she is finally coming out with a novel this year."
4,Classic Indian Characters,"As I read Ms. Appachana's work, I was constantly reminded of how things were and still are back home. For me, there was no drowning myself in fiction - the characters were real enough to touch and smell (surely every Indian is aware of a Sharmaji!). There was no unnecessary drama - no unchartered territory to explore - no special messages to convey. Such genuine depiction of character and events, free of frivolous mentions, stands dignified in its own accord."
3,No libretto!,"I agree with almost all of the comments by other reviewers of this work. There is one problem: no libretto! My Italian is not good enough to follow the words, and I am left feeling frustrated -- and eager to go out and learn better Italian! You'd think the producers of this set of CDs (or Amazon.com) would note the lack of a libretto somewhere in their advertisement."
1,Chilton repair manual,"Buy it at the auto parts store, it'll be cheaper. It IS NOT the multi-book set as pictured. It was very little help."
4,Great ending to a fascinating tale,"The ferocious predator called the Roar has reached Earth. Now the children of Coldharbour will see if they are indeed ready to face this danger.Helen is able to probe the Roar's mind, to an attempt to find secrets. Emily and Freda--the insect girls--go to great lengths to help the Protector.Jenny turns into a terrifying weapon.Milo uses his silver wings against a shower of poison.And the others all band together, waiting for the arrival of the Roar and her newborns who are not only famished but have murder on their minds.SILVER WORLD is the third book in the Silver Sequence. I'd recommend reading the first book to get a better understanding of the story. Cliff McNish does a great job creating a world where the children develop super human skills in order to defend the world as they know it."
4,Addendum to previous review : use with caution,"This book needs to be used with caution. There is no mention of Gunter Wand's recordings of Beethoven Symphonies and Mackerras's life enhancing cycle of Mozart symphonies is simply dismissed because of his fast tempi as though fast tempi is synonymous with lack of expressiveness.To me Bohm's and Mackerras' views of Mozart are equally valid. If there were only one mode of interpretation, one could program a computer to play the score. To me a great work is capable of different interpretations. Morover, though the publication date is 2002, many new recordings are simply missing like Perahia's marvellous recordings of Bach's keyboard concertos.I am not replacing my Penguin or Gramophone as yet."
3,"Outdated,but useful and interesting to read.......","This edition was published in 2002 and sorely needs to be updated, including re-releases. I find this book makes for much more interesting reading than the Penguin Guide, which reads more like a catalog, but one should use that latter resource as well as the Gramophone magazine as additional comparisons.Some of the opinions in this book seem to be quite divergent from those posted here on Amazon, for example - the glowing review of Annie Fischer's Hungaroton 10-CD set of Beethoven piano sonatas seems to be at odds with at least several reviewers of that set on Amazon.I would like to see the composer's names in larger print on the page so that they can be more quickly spotted when scanning through."
5,Extremely useful,"Having used and admired the Penguin and Gramaphone guides, I found this one the best of all. Though now dated - it arrived in 01 and will not be updated since its authors have since died - it is still the most useful printed guide to recorded classical music available. If the past 10 years of recordings are not here, then the previous 70 are, so one cannot go wrong in deciding what to buy if one is assembling a collection and/or filling in gaps. I have been over this book with a fine tooth comb and I adore its opinionated writings, even if some composers do get short shrift, while others seem to have dozens of pages. This is fine book for the ages and needed by every classical music collector."
4,Classical Music Guide,This is an extremely comprehensive guide to classical music by over 500 composers and provides authoritative recommendations on the various performances of their works that are available on record. For each composer there is detailed information about their life and a critical analysis of their work. So this is both a biographical dictionary and a guide to recorded music. The articles are well written in an accessible style and the book is attractively produced. Highly recommended for the classical music lover.
5,Indispensable companion,"This is an exhaustive, if now somewhat dated guide go classical recordings. The reviews are wonderfully idiosyncratic, full of strong opinions. Covers a very wide range of recordings for many pieces, and is very readable. I cannot recommend this strongly enough for someone building or expanding a classical music collection. I have the Penguin guide too, of course, but found this a breath of fresh air and a necessarily complement to the Penguin guide. If pushed, I would probably pick this one over that, if only because it offers such interesting opinions. I believe the editor has died, however, so do not know if it will every be revised and updated."
2,How useful a reference?,"This reference can be useful to the general reader but would not serve the fan or musician looking for re-released recordings of legendary artists who are not listed in the index or in thebiographies of instrumentalists. Thus, one has to wonderwhat else has been omitted either out of carelessnessor choice."
2,Stop The Interruptions!,"Why on earth do the producers of these music dvd's interrupt the great music? On some other music dvds - Motown series come to mind - you had to deal with some talk over either on the intros or outros. This one is even worse as the interruptions are in the middle of the songs. Are you kidding me? Unfortunately, no. What a waste!!"
5,TERRIFIC CELEBRATION OF THE TIMELESS MUSIC OF THE MAMAS & THE PAPAS,"This documentary focuses on the marvelous musical legacy of The Mamas & The Papasfrom a time and place that can never be replicated but lives on through thewonderful recordings that still resonate decades later, reaching new generations.Rare footage and interviews combine to tell the story of this unique and unusualquartet without dwelling on the drama.Like most documentaries the song clips are not usually full-length here, but they aregenerous and one can always listen to the CDs for the complete songs.The DVD does come with special bonus songs in their entirety and it's all availablefor a very reasonable price. This program first appeared on PBS and is the definitiveand fully authorized documentary of The Mamas & The Papas. Get your copy now!"
4,Good DVD,The California Dreamin' DVD is very enjoyable. Wish they would let them complete more songs instead of cutting them short.
2,disapointed,"I love the Mamas & The Papas, this DVD did not have one song without it being interupted. Don't buy this DVD if you are looking to hear just music because you are not going too. It is a waste of money, what a shame, It could have been good if they shut up and just did bonus footage instead."
3,Charming,"The songs are great.But you will really get a chuckle when you watch the group on stage. They had NO sense of choriography at all and they move awkwardly onstage. They really were, as John Phillips said, mainly a studio band. The funniest segment comes watching Barry McGuire ""getting down"" to ""Do You Believe In Magic"", with the group backing him up on vocals. Hopelessly White!"
4,Delicious natural tasting bread,"I had a pack of the cracked wheat bread mix in my kitchen for several months, and one night decided to make it. I used 1 can of beer and the 1/4 cup of vegetable oil with the mix. This bread is absolutely delicious! Its fresh and has a great texture. Why wait hours and mess around with yeast when you can buy this simple mix and have warm, fresh bread in under an hour?"
3,Rico Reedgard IV,"This compact reed guard holds 4 reeds and fits almost anywhere. It keeps the reeds flat with little rails underneath for ventilation. The only problem I have with it is that it is pretty easy to put the reed in with too much pressure on the holder, so that the holder ends up denting the top of the cut part of the reed, which ruins the reed. If I push a clarinet reed in as far as in the photo, it's history. So the reeds end up overhanging the edge so as not to be too tight, and then they get pushed in from hitting the inside of the clarinet case, and the next thing you know...dented reeds.For a better reed guard that won't pinch and damage your reeds, try the Vito clarinet reed guard for soprano (model 2434) or bass/alto (model 2439) clarinet. The Vito reed guard uses elastic bands which will not pinch or dent the reed."
1,Ditto the other bad reviews,This album didn't sound like Mehldau at all...the whole time I felt like he was trying really hard to do something that never quite came together. I will be listing my copy as a used item at a rock bottom price out of protest. Hopefully I'll save one soul from burning the full $19 for this turd.SPEND YOUR HARD EARNED CASH ON SOMETHING ELSE.
1,Why?,"Why team the golden voice of Renee Fleming with someone who is essentially a non-composer? Mr. Mehldau's technique lacks development and is more ""new age"" (YUK) than jazz. His idea of accompanying is the random striking of cords, and the poor singer is left to her own devices to try to make something of a melody - with almost nothing to work with. (I majored in composition in college, but it does NOT make me a composer). Ms. Fleming, however, as always is in her top vocal form and overcomes the lack of decent writing with her usual first-class vocal skill. Bottom line: Save your money. Buy any Renee Fleming disc but this one!"
3,Round out your collection only,Videos are of excellent image quality but not the best of the Shaw brothers flicks in the least bit. Convoluted plots and avg. fight scenes. For true collectors only.
1,Disappointed,I was very disappointed in this purchase. The seller never mentioned anything about the titles of the movies AND it's not in English.
3,Child's Play,"Lujan paints a picture of life through a child's imagination in this poem about discovery. Loosey based on a children's game, everyday objects are used to show how everything in life is connected, each opening to reveal another distinctly different larger thing. The symbolism will be lost on small children, but they will enjoy the singsong flow of the words and the incredible drawings. Quintana's pastel, dreamlike illustrations are well suited to the simple poem, but the random highlighting of the text is distracting. The award winning Lujan is well known for his magical imagery and visual pictures and he stays true to form here. Beyond My Hand appeals to two distinctly different audiences, the very young who will enjoy it for its imagination and simplicity, and the scholars who will analyze it for the deeper meaning!"
3,Update available?,"This was likely a very good book when published, but unfortunately, it is a bit out of date. For example, there are 15 reviews in the B's (alphabetically), but 5 of the restaurants have closed. Having said that, the book is well done and still useful when trying to find a good place to eat-just call ahead. There are 2 indices that I found helpful: listing of restaurants by neighborhood and listing by food type. The index lacks page numbers, but the restaurants are organized by name, so just remember your ABC's. My book appears to be the 5th printing of the first edition, purchased mid-late 2004. Portland prides itself on great food and local ingredients. If visiting, don't miss trying one of the local restaurants. A good, free guide is the weekly Willamette Week newspaper."
2,mike bloomfield,"i bought this for the song ""you was wrong"" and for collection.the rest of this isnt very good."
5,An excellent read.,"A rich, nostalgic, delving into Duncan Macleod's character. He is ""Duncan Macleod of the Clan Macleod"", but how much of that has become just words? The author perfectly captures the show's characters and the relationships between them. The writing is excellent. I've lost count of how many times I've reread this book."
1,Skip it,"When historical fiction is bad, more often than not, it is _really_ bad. This novel is an example of poor research coupled with a poor writing style. I haven't read any of Roberson's other books, and I'm unlikely to now. If they are anythng like this, I won't waste my time."
4,great for the money,I paid about $5(I wish everyone would make a point to say how much they paid on all their purchases since this makes a world of a difference when reading other user's reviews.)Great design and very clean looking.It looks like a $40 cuff link.
5,An Excellent Book,"This is my favorite book about not only Jimi Hendrix, but Robert Johnson and Charlie Christian too. Occasionally Charles Shaar Murray gets a little carried away during his wordy descriptions, but it doesn't matter. If you want to learn about the evolution of African American guitarists, this is the place to start."
2,"Interesting, but skews a little too far into the sexual","I really like Taschen box calendars and have had one on my desk for the last three years. While most of their calendars involve a particular artist or movement, this one concerns interesting objects from all over the world.As appealing as that can be (and indeed, most of the objects and their descriptions are interesting), there's a strong sexual skew in the calendar as a whole -- enough to make you want to hide it from the kids. For instance, objects include sex toys with full color depictions.It would have been a much better piece of work if it was designed for all ages. Or, at the very least, its adult skew was listed prominently on the box.Nothing's worse than having your morning coffee, tearing off yesterday's calendar page, and being greeted by a photograph of a pink lipstick vibrator."
5,amazing!,I made a cake for Superbowl. Turn out just pretty! Make sure to butter your pan before pouring batter.
4,fun,"This is a fun pan, I wish it were a little bit bigger however.It is so small that it is hard to detail. But I put it on top of a larger flat cake to give it the appearance of being bigger..Once you detail it, it is a great show piece for those fun parties!"
4,brownies!,"I love this cake mold, I put in 1 and 1/2 boxes of brownie mix, however, I have trouble baking it for just the right time. I put dots on the seats. and sometimes make little scorboards with paper sticking up. It's a hit! I do have trouble getting it out of the pan . I use Bakers joy. When I use the mix on the label, I put on a cookie sheet to help cook the bottom of the pan evenly.War Eagle!"
5,Great pan for a stadium cake!,This heavy pan made a great cake that was cute and easily recognizable. The cake came right out - I had no problems with any sticking but I did use cooking spray first.
4,Way smaller than it looks!,Decent quality. The cake pan is just so tiny! It makes a cake really tough to decorate. And there's no real wow factor with it being so small.
4,Fun party cake,At first I hesitated because it looks much too intricate to decorate but I bought it anyway because we have a lot of football parties. It was a snap. Use the same cake mix (pound) as you would for a bundt cake and color coconut green for the grass. Decorating was easy as a bundt cake doesn't crumble. Lots of compliments.
4,A big surprise!,"This was given as a gift to a middle school coach who could not believe his eyes. This pan is easy to use, robust, and gives the final product alot of detail."
5,Wonderful!,"This is my first book by Ms. Camp and I was pleasantly surprised by it. Angela's artless innocence and love is challenged when she is torn from her one true love. Cameron has great determination and ambition--with a secret parentage. When Dunstan conspires with her family to rip them apart, their struggle against class prejudice is all the more poignant.I'd also like to recommend Elizabeth Thornton, Joan Johnston, Julia Quinn, Julia London."
2,Ok except for the horrifying sexual violence,I was shocked by the explicit rape and other sexual abuse in this book. The overall story is fine but that ruined it for me.
2,Don't Recommend,"I really enjoy all of her books, so this one caught me by suprise. I know that I tend to be sensitive, but the explicit details of how she was sexually abused, raped, etc., was very upsetting to me. If you don't handle this sort of stuff well, DONT read this book. Her other books aren't like this one."
3,Disappointing.,I read this on kindle from the library. I was left wishing that I had not wasted my time.The story is historical romance without a very concrete concept of English or Scottish history or society.
3,Not like Suddenly.,"Impulse by Candace Camp was a bit of a disappoint. Most romance stories are similar tales and it is what the writer creates around the basic plot that makes them fun, enlightening and hopefully enjoyable. This author's book, Suddenly is one of my favorites. What made that book memorable was the characters and how they faced the problems they encountered, but in Impulse, the sexual violence overpowers the characters and their problems. The basic story of those who fall in love with someone below their social station is good and I especially liked the character of Mr. Pettigrew. If the story had followed its original plot in the writer's usual style I think it would have been much more enjoyable. The heroine of this story and the villain just didn't feel real. Victims of severe sexual abuse don't wander the moors alone, drawing pictures of flowers and sexual predators are a lot more complicated than the character in this book who is more of a literary device than a terror."
4,"Good, but be warned","This was a good story overall, but there was a particularly disturbing description of the heroine's sexual abuse by her former husband. I think the story could have been told just as well without it.The conflicting viewpoints about the past of the hero and heroine made for a very good read, as well as the creative way in which he helped her overcome her understandable fear of intimacy."
4,A Great Album By One of Chi-Town's Finest!!!,"Twista shows his rapid tongue fire flows with versatility and in a laid back, veteran manner. The Legendary Traxter supplies the hypnotic and eerie beats that'll have heads nodding for days. Twista's subject matter doesn't change much (women, mobster stories, the streets) but he spits lyrics creatively, using his own theology for bangin raps. A great addition to your album collection!!!"
5,"Best Twista album yet, One of rap's greatest albums yet...","This CD is great. It has been in my cd player constantly for about 2 weeks now, I haven't even put in the new Tupac yet because I am hooked on this one. This is a great cd because Twista has stepped it up, he used to just rap as fast as he could and not make any sense, but he has redone his style and the lyrics in all of this albums songs are great, and he still raps faster than anyone else in the game, except maybe Sandman, a Minneapolis rapper (No Secrets, No Lies is his album)... in all you can absolutely not go wrong getting this CD, you will pat yourself on the back once you get it because it is great. Best tracks: Adrenaline Rush, Feels So Good, Get It Wet, Emotions, Korrupt World, and the Emotions Remix but all the tracks are great! BUY IT NOW."
1,Weak!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! No skills!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"If you want to hear someone talk fast, go to an auction. If you want to hear a good rapper go to New York."
3,"He's good, but not great!","Twista is a alright rapper, but he's not too too great like most of you guys claim. I have Adreneline Rush and I think it's a good album, but it's just too dull for me. He raps kinda fast, but he never switches up his style. Not one bit. I easily get bored from his rapping. I like his new album, ""Kamikaze"" a bit more, but it's still missing a lot.Also, he never had the record for fastest rapper on Guinness World Records. Rebel XD has the record right now, and can't be touched by Twista. Sorry...If you like fast rappers, I'd recommend you pick up T-Nutty's new album. Also, check out Sandman. He's probably 10 times the artist that Twista is.I'm a fan of Bone's, so if you like real talented artists, using their talent right, pick up their albums as well."
5,Simply one of the best all around albums of all time...,"Twista is simply one of the most underated lyricist of all time. He can be added to the elite class of rappers such as Kool G. Rap, Pharoah Monch and Rass Kass who have never and unfortunately will probably never recieve the praise and recogniton they desreve as some of the best ever. Anyone who says otherwise is obviously not a fan of the art and is not taking the time to listen that a true hip-hop fan takes to judge skill. I myself doubted his ability until I was exposed to this CD. And for all of you who might say... ""He's probably some country cat who doesn't know anything about lyricism"" (No offense to all of you out of towners) Peep this album for real!!!!!"
5,BEATZ SHAKE THA STREET,"I HAD THIZ CD FOR 1 1/2 YEARS AN IT NEVER GETZ OLD. TWISTA BEATZ R TIGHT. THA REASON WHY HE DUNT GET PROPZ IZ CZ EDITORZ DUNT FOLL0W HIZ LYRICZ, WHICH ARE ALL DOPE. HIZ FLOW WILL KEEP YOU LISTENIN. THA HOTEST TRACKZ ON HERE ARE, ADRENALINE RUSH, DEATH BE FOR DIS HONOR, AND OVERDOSE. YALL SHOULD CHECK OUT MOBSTABILITY WHILE YOUR AT IT, CZ IT HAZ A FEW BOMB TRACKZ, LIKE BONE CRUSHER AN LOYALTY. DO OR DIE'S BOTH CDZ ARE TIGHT TO, THEY REPRESENT THA CHI, SAME AZ THA TWIST. PEACE"
3,Funny but also kinda sad,"This book is funny year-in-the-life look at a struggling 36 year old women writer living in Van Nuys, CA. As a former resident of LA, I found the book both funny and sad. While Sandra's life takes some humerous twists and turns, the main theme of the book is that getting old is hard (no surprise there). Aging is all the more difficult in LA-LA land where appearance is everything and substance counts for next to nothing. Really, a sad commentary on Southern California life."
4,Mostly Great,"Sandra Tsing Loh's latest book reads more like a series of her hilarious essays cloaked in the guise of a novel. The novel's structure follows the character of ""Sandra"" through one year of her life as she struggles with writers block, perilously careens towards 36, and lives in of all places-horrors!-Van Nuys California. All of this is done with her bone dry humor in rare form, especially in the earlier half of the novel when she's expounding on the Zone diet, and Bally's Total Fitness. I loved the first two thirds, then felt it petered out a little by the end. Living in Los Angeles I found alot of the book really funny, although I don't know how people outside the city would relate. However most people in their mid thirties will find her characters plight at ""what am I doing with my life"" syndrome very real, funny, and a little bit scary. If you're a fan of David Sedaris, N.P.R., or just like to feel like you're hip and in the know, you'd probably enjoy this."
2,"Kvetch, Kvetch, kvetch...","You know, I just couldn't get into this book. It reminded me a little of the cartoon, Cathy, and of Briget Jones's Diary (book, not movie): I feel as though someone needs to smack all these woman upside the head and tell them, ""Get a life!""I bought the book expecting to love it. I got about a third of the way through, and it just wasn't really going anywhere, so I said to myself, I'm over it.It felt as though she was just trying too hard to be funny.So I sold my copy on Amazon.[com.]"
5,Amazing snare for sheer volume and tone.,"This snare is a must buy. If you need an inexpensive, quality snare, that can cut through loud rock, then you've come to the right place. Genre = post hardcore/indie. I didn't realize how bad my other snare sounded until I started smacking this thing in the face. And recorded, even better!"
3,Ewok could look better,"I love the titanium series of SW toys, but Paploo's face isn't very well painted. I'm sure some are better than others. =\"
3,"Worthwhile, if not the best","One cannot appreciate this album if they approach it as a classic Pogues disc. It isn't. When Shane left, the group probably should have changed their name. There's a similar attention to interesting instrumentals and eclectic styles, however, and as an album, Herb holds together pretty darn well. There's a definite eastern flavor to some of it, and the idea of using sounds from a pachinko parlor is brilliant. Drunken Boat is one of my all-time favorites, and My Baby's Gone has more spirit than anything from Pogue Mahone. The songs span a variety of styles broader than any album but the brilliant If I Should Fall...diehard Shane fans should follow the Popes as well, but while this album doesn't spit fire and whiskey, it has some good music."
1,No Shane Just Shame,"Without a leading talent it fails to reach the dizzy heights of mrdiocrity - IT IS NOT THE POGUES !!! lacking in their vitality and spontaneity. It fails any link to the real roots of their original works. It can only be described as, and should have been entitled, ""Pogue Mockery"". One star rating is generosity in excess."
2,No teeth in McGowanless Pogues,"When Shane McGowan left the Pogues, he took the bite out of them. What's left is, oddly, the same band singing similar songs with better diction. But the saliva-spitting fury that was at its core is gone."
2,What Happened?,"This isn't the pogues. It reminds me of something a phish fan would listen to. Go buy a popes CD, or better yet, pogue mahone, or any of the earlier pogues CD's, which are awesome. I bought this, and almost immediately sold it. It wouldn't have been so bad if it didn't have that false adverstising ""pogues"" on the cover. Final word, no shane = no pogues ."
1,Belongs in a Dollar Store,"I was pleased to find this product availabe. You'd think that, having been around for well over a decade, the CD would have come down in price or been taken off the market. The sound quality is excellent but the tracks are mislabeled and songs listed on the cover are not on the CD. So, I find the price to have been a bit lofty. If I could reverse my purchase, I would do it in a heartbeat. I do not attribute this to AMAZON, I think there were a bunch of people somewhere who decided it would be great to make an Edith Piaf karaoke Cd and then halfway through they got drunk and said ""to hell with it""."
2,Small and ugly,This poster is too dark and generally not beautiful at all. You should find another one if you are a truly fan of TLOTR.
4,Excellent,I have not heard any other performance but find this work very energetic and vibrant.The playing if beautiful and clear. If there is a better recording I would love to know because it would have to be amazing! IHO
5,Intriguing and Exciting Story,"From the moment I started Sun and Shade I had trouble putting it down. The carefully woven story of a Spanish family is very involving. I was caught up in the meticulous connections of the content as the book developed. By the time I was finished it all fit together perfectly. She has very realistic characters and the historical setting is unforgettable. What an incredible voice, I could hear the author sing thoughout the reading. I would highly recommend this book. Bravo, more more please."
5,What a Book!,"What a book! The antithesis of For WHom the Bell Tolls. The action spans 30 years instead of three and the events are seen through the eyes of Spaniards instead of an American. The author wrote with heart and passion about a forgotten war. Great characters. Touching love story. And Pedro, what a man!"
2,Mediocre,"The writing in this book can be best described as sophomoric. The characters are as developed as one would expect to find in a high school short story. While set it Spain, the book neglects to capture a ""Spanish voice"" that many other authors have been able to perfect. In her attempt to touch everything Spanish, Exposito-Glass has created a simplistic model of what should be, and perhaps could be, a very complex and interesting story."
2,Cheap,"These headbands do the job in that they 1) don't slide off your head; 2) are cute and wide; 3) and come in a variety of colors. The problem is they are super cheaply made, as in, if you knew how to sew and had the right materials, you could whip them out in a few minutes for a dollar or two. For the price and the quality of the headbands, they are a huge ripoff."
2,Too thin,These headbands were pretty thin - I was looking for something to deflect sweat off my face during hot yoga and these just didn't do it
2,Not this author's best effort,"The Alien Upstairs, is a short but fairly dull read, due mainly to the fact that no one point in the story is explored to any depth. The two main characters are petty and shallow, while the supposedly more intriguing ""alien"" upstairs neighbor is even more so. What little bit there is of this book is still fairly well written, when all parties involved aren't bickering constantly."
2,"Nanak, a Brhamin","The book looses its veracity because of its unnecessary diatribe against the Brahmins. The author is propagating a dangerous attack on a minority community, which was started by the foreign invaders to weaken the Hindu community. To classify Nehru, Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi as Brahmins and condemn all Brahmins for their actions is insane. If the above three, meat eating,atheists were Brahmins, then Guru Nanak was definitely a Brahmin.Stories of Sikhs attacking Hindu villages, buses ambushed and selectively killing Hindus and many acts of terrorism which is part of the history of Sikhs are missing.He puts a favorable spin on Jinnah in comparison with Gandhi."
4,Informative if somewhat biased account,"Mr Singh's survey is brief. He does justice to the nationalist aspirations of the Sikhs and the various forms of discriminations against them, but does not address the more common or everyday 'stereotyping' as nouveaux riches, dagger carriers and turban wearers. Mr Singh is good at explaining the Sikh's view of their own history but tends to be impartial in praising their causes or worldview. Indeed, he begins by attacking one of the oldest world religion - and rival -Hinduism by criticizing, among other things, its caste system and particualrly the Brahmins who have dominated the Indian subcontinent for much of its history. He also dismisses other competing religious groups in india - i.e. Buddhists. Overall, despite the understandable bias I found the book informative, if unbalanced. It is also worthwhile as America becomes more embroiled in central Asia. After all the Sikh region prevails in the Punjab, a region which India shares with Pakistan."
4,The Sikh,Being of Sikh background and a Seaker of that absolute truth. I feel this book does a great job to reach out to non-sikh audiances. it gives a good overview of all history of the Sikhs to start at an introductary level. much respect to Patwant Singh for putting it out.
1,Could have been better,I expected a lot more from this book and it let me down a lot. It's only saving grace are some surprises like Paths and character bios.
4,Assamites maul everything!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I've taken on werewolves with my Assamite. They0're the BEST clan for more experianced players. If your Chronicling for werewolves, having one or more of then unexpectadly... Meet an Assamite assassin could really screw up a capaign (if played right[GRIN])."
3,First edition is still worth reading.,"The first edition is definitely still worth reading. Unlike the second it contains a short description of the very beginning. The First City makes the foundation for our Jyhad. It is vital to understand the crucial role of Assamites in the world of vampires. The book includes the Khabar - essential rules for every Assamite's life. Unfortunately both had been skipped in the second edition. You also find aiming rules, special weapons, new merits&flaws; and more.I won't consider the books to editions, rather they are two volumes of the Clanbook. If you have access to it, you should read it."
5,I Used To Use This To Teach,"I used to go around to childcare programs and teach ""Stranger Danger"" and ""Good Touch, Bad Touch"" programs and this is one of my favorite video's to use. The kids really loved it and WANTED to watch it over and over to the point that the information was retained. I'd suggest this video to anyone who asked me about it, it's incredible."
5,Too Smart for Strangers with Winnie The Pooh,This was a great find for this classic video for the kids. The VHS arrived on time and in great shape. Was as described in listing at a great price. Would do business with this seller again
4,Japan's most beloved criminal arrives stateside!,"I love the whimsical, fun adventures of Lupin III. The show strikes a nice balance between action, drama, and comedy. The drawing style is very quaint too... it just basically indicates right off the bat that you're gonna have a rollicking good time watching the show.The English dub is very fresh and fun to listen to. Some updated cultural references are thrown in to make the show not so much dated (the show is supposed to be set in the 1970s), but it doesn't bother most people, especially me. For those that like to listen to the original Japanese with the English subtitles, well, hopefully you know some good Japanese, because the subtitles look like they were translated into simplified English. I think some of the Japanese nuances may have been lost in the English subtitles. That's probably the only drawback to this DVD.If you're into chases all over the world, some wild action, and some really funny stuff, you can't go wrong with Lupin III."
5,Tree Your Cats With Ease,"This book is a terrific resource for any cat owner. It has lots of pictures and step-by-step instructions for building cat trees that you can customize to fit the space available, the size of your cat, and how elaborate you want your cat tree to be. Cat trees sell in stores for hundreds of dollars, and this book will enable you to make trees that are just as good but cost only a fraction of the store-bought ones. (Plus you can carpet them to match your decor!) You don't need fantastic carpentry skills, either, to build cat trees if you have this book.This book is one of the most helpful I've ever seen. I recommend it without reservation."
4,the best book I could find on the subject,"This is a great book for people with minimal carpentry skills. I didn't want to spend $100+ for my 2 kittens to have a cat tree, so I ordered this book from the actual webpage (the shipping is quicker). The book isn't ""professionally"" bound ; it looks like it was done at a [copy shop], but the content is great and it is worth the [price]. You really need to read through his instructions a couple of times to verify you understand his directions. I managed to build a really nice cat tree (6 feet tall with 5 shelves) following his instructions for about $60. Plus, since you do the work yourself, odds are that your carpeting job will look much better than a store bought tree. I wasn't able to find any other directions as detailed as the ones in this book, and I totally recommend it."
4,Book Review,"This reading on Stereotypes and Prejudice provides many key facts and points of views which I found very helpful for use in a big project. Though it will take sometime to read, it's not a book you can just skim over, you must actually take time to digest all of the information because it can get complicated."
2,Not for the seasoned Karaoke fan,I was not impressed with this CD at all. The sound quality is a C- sounds very electronic. You can not use this with a monitor as it does not have video. The price is way to high for the overall quality. Pass on this one!
5,Great!,"Great shopping experience, book was in great condition and shipped quickly. Highly recommend them and would definitely buy from them again! Also, this book was a fabulous read! Highly recommend it to anyone interested in social theory!"
3,Hard to read,This book is hard to read. The author tries to summarize and make thinks easier. My professor assigned this book because it was hard to read.
3,Textbook,"It's a text book. Seidman tends to put his own spin on the various social theories, but its a pretty good overview."
5,R.B.L POSSE IS THA TIGHTEST GROUP UP IN FRIZKO!!!!!!!!!,MR.CEE AND BLACK CHRIS WERE HELLA TIGHT TOGETHER WHO SHOT MR.CEE? RBL POSSE IS TIGHT I LIKE LESSON TO BE LEARNED AND RUTHLESS BY LAW I WISH IHAD RUTHLESS BY LAW THE CD CUZ I ALREADY HAVE THE OTHER ONE ON TAPE. ONE LAST THING RBL IS TIGHT AND PASS ME THE ZIG ZAGS.
3,Til' the end...,"the best cut on this effort is most likely the last track, ""Til' The End (featuring The P-O-S-S-E)"" just my humble opinion though, as I had to repeat-play it several times because of the groovy flow 8^)bottom line...if you do pick up this CD for your collection make sure to play the LAST TRACK FIRST!!!"
3,Streaky paint job,"This sun plaque is a beautiful piece, or would have been, if care was taken when the metallic paint was applied. Mine arrived with two very large dribbles ( raised heavy streaks ) of paint, one running straight down the left side of the sun's forehead, and the second, an even larger streak running down from his right eye all the way to the chin. Totally ruins the look and character of the wall plaque, almost appearing that Old Sol was both crying and sweating at the same time. Mine is also not anywhere near the coloration of the one shown in the photo with description. Color on the one I received is almost a uniform shade so it appears flat and lifeless. A dissappointing purchase."
2,Why is the sun crying?,"I love this model of the sun, but am so disappointed that there is a big drip of paint running from the inside corner of the sun's right eye down its cheek. It's like the sun is crying. This is unsettling because of the large smile. Is there supposed to be an irony to this that I missed?"
4,Cute decoration,Very cute decoration - I should have looked a little closer at the diameter because i wanted something a little bigger but that is my fault. I will be keeping this.
4,Like it,"This is light weight and cute. Perfect for the outside of my house, under protective covering. Not sure how it would do out in the weather."
1,There are NOT 1000 envelopes.,"The ad says ""Box of 1000"", but it only a box of 100. Is this false advertising or a typo? I don't know, but it's certainly bad."
1,stinks,all bags had busted balls.junk.what a pain to have to ship it backnever again will i buy paint online
4,Good paintballs,"I got these paintballs only about 5 days after ordering. none of them were broken and they worked really well with my gun. whenever I tell people I got 2000 paintballs for 30.00 bucks the first thing they say is ""oh they must be really bad"" I would definatley recommend these. good product for the price."
2,Good 1/2,"i dont know about this brand but i bought mine at walmart for $29.00, i thought it was great untill i shot them, the dont break in your barrel as much, i had about 5 break, shot right trough... anyway The filling is yellow, light yellow, i could barely see it, sux for fast ball unless u got honest people in the other team, i'd go with stingers and white fill, they are $34 with free shipping and they show great for $5 extra :D i think they are woth it, us paintballers are made of pennies not dollars but if they show, get em"
1,Don't do it!!!,"I have just started playing paintball and I have a Tippman A-5. I got to say that these things are awfull. Yes they are cheap but I spent the day firing them off like crazy today. None of them broke in my barrel but none of them broke on anybody I shot either. The guys I was playing with said these things were hitting hard but they just weren't breaking. Throughout the day I fired off an entire bag of these things and I have to admit that the only ones that I can confirm busted on target were the ones I fired at a steel barrel at 25-5 feet. The 25 feet is an exageration I highly doubt I was that far away but I give them the benefit of the doubt. Don't get them. I didn't get these from this company however, I got mine from Sports Authority."
2,Worst Paintballs Ever!!!!,These paintballs are the worst!! They bouce off and the fill is so light it is a cheat for the opponent. Never buy these even for practice! I would buy the JT Monster Balls in green fill from Wal-Mart for $28 for 2000.
5,Arthur Seeger had a brilliant and independent mind.,"Arthur Seeger had a brilliant and independent mind. This should be a standard in sociology, unfortunately it's way too politically incorrect for socially controlling academics. Sad that his valuable work is ignored in such a closed academic system."
3,Gotta love the ghosty fluff.,"I will be honest. Mr. Yates' writing is clean and clear, but hardly impressive. The characters aren't the most dimensional you'll see. The story is cheesy.But I don't care. I have read this book multiple times, and I'm sure I will read it again. By golly, Mr. Yates, but you can tell a fun story.And what a concept! What's not to love? A supernatural romance, soul mates separated by a typo. It's a charming and hysterical concept that really makes for an entertaining read. The romance is fun and light-hearted, and you have to admire what personality the characters do show.It's fun and original and romantic. True, the story is forced to drive itself, but it doesn't do a bad job."
5,THE STONECUTTER'S ARIA,My husband and I both loved this book. After recommending the book to my book club I was worried that they wouldn't like it as well as we did because they aren't Italian. They loved it too! The author does a wonderful job of weaving her family's story. This book of historical fiction makes me want to do more research and write about my Italian heritage. It makes a great gift for my Italian relatives.
1,Warped,"It warped immediately after being washed the first time. It hadn't been soaked or <gasp> put in the dishwasher -- just soapy water, rinse, and dry. Hold one corner down against the countertop, and an opposite corner lifts by half an inch. But that's not the end of it. Wet down the top (the side with the groove on it) and don't dry it off, and it flattens out in about three minutes.This might be a great widget for a science-fair project; it bends and curls at the slightest hint of moisture. But as a cutting board it's a dead loss."
5,Amazing...,"I overheard these guys playing at the Westwood Brewery on January 9th, 2002. I loved their sound so much, I went upstairs to find out who they were and whether they were online. The very next day, I purchased their album from ... It has lived up to my every expectation.I'm shocked that these guys haven't yet been picked up by a major label. They're of the same caliber as Creed and the other modern melodic rock bands being played all over the radio today. Their lyrics contain depth and meaning, their melodies draw you in, and their musicianship is extremely professional.I definitely recommend this CD. And if you get the chance - go see these guys play live."
1,Fairly mediocre,"I found this book to be fairly mediocre - not very deep in its content and skipping by the hard problems. Typical book written by a software vendor who would like to seem like a domain expert, while in reality they are only looking to promote their product. On the bright side it's a book about applications of data mining, which is always interesting - I only wish it was worthwhile to read, especially at the ludicrous price of $99."
5,Remote Sensing,"This is a must read for anyone interested (and serious) in remote sensing and digital image analysis. This is not as an introductory book as it claims to be so be aware of that, and some chapters requires a good understanding of math (algebra). If you are advanced in RS then get this book as reference, you won't regret it."
4,If only these versions were on her album,"I was disappointed with the porn rap that filled Kim's Hard Core album. Thankfully, these three songs have Kim focusing on real lyrical skills and bangin' beats. ""Crush On You"" has Cease kicking the same verse as on the original while Kim rips it. She does the same on ""Drugs"" and ""Not Tonight (remix)"". But for the latter, if the chorus says ""It's ladies' night"", then why is the song called ""Not Tonight""?"
5,Excellent slice of life,"I got this book a few years agoat a book signing in Traverse City. It is an excellent portrait of life in a family, with some wonderful illustrations. I especially liked the telling of some of the story from the viewpoint of ""Andy"", the young boy, who, as it happens, is modeled qute a bit after my close friend Frank Perkins, whom the cat is named after.Aside from the personal ties, I find the book very easy to relate to, having a cat of my own who is rather prone to injuries. This is a great book for families to read together, as well as for someone to read on their own."
2,Not what I expected,This book is more the history and popularity over the years of names versus an actual name book. Overpriced for what you get. I flipped through it a couple times then passed it on to a pregnant relative who probably did the same.
5,The Baby Name Wizard: A Magical Method for Finding the Perfect Name for Your Baby,"Worth every penny. I have had it since I was 3 months pregnant. I am now only 5 and a half, but look through this weekly in search of a great name. I love this book b/c it tells you names that you should name this childs siblings based on the name you pick."
4,Good Book/Probably Available on the Internet,"This book is more than just a list of names in alphabetical order. There are subgroups and sound-alikes and names for siblings that can help you connect a name you might like to more names that might match. In all, it is a great book that will likely help my wife and I pick a name, but this isn't anything that you couldn't get at a free site online."
2,"My money back!!!!! Incomplete, Names without meanings","I was looking for a baby names book, after I read the reviews from this book I tough it was a good option, but this is not. The book has a long boring list that is even boring to follow in your kindle. I just started this book and I realize this is not what I was looking for, just took me a few minutes to realize this is a boring list of names, and the book doesn't have the name's meanings. A book about names without the meaning!!!!!! that is totally incomplete!!!! Just one day in my hands and I want my money back!!!The reason I don't give it one star is because the author took a lot of time doing this job but it is incomplete."
4,Well worth the buy,"We pretty much had our names picked out before I bought this book and it just re-affirmed our choices. What is intersting and helpful about this book is the way the author provides a ""snap shot"" of a name including popularity, style, varriants, and brother/sister name suggestions that go along. The author also explains naming trends wich explains why when a name is picked and thought to be unique it isn't... The one drawback about this book was that a couple of the names I was interested in looking up were not referenced on their own. One was listed only as a nickname which I don't believe it to be, and the other was only listed as a suggested brother/sister name to other names. That was surprising and a bit disapointing..."
3,Hard to use on the Kindle,"It would be okay, but hard to read on my e-reader. Didn't really help us pick a name at all."
5,Baby Name Book,I like the origins of the name and the statitistics on popularity. A must read for all expectant parents.
5,very helpful! different than other baby books,"This book was super-helpful to us in picking a boy's name. We just could not think of many, and the lists and descriptions are clever and spot-on. I had a lot of fun reading through this book. It made choosing a name an enjoyable process. Much more insightful and modern than other baby books that just list names. Good mix of traditional and modern names."
5,The best baby name book,"I think this book is fantastic. It gives you a number of ways to search through all the names to find the right one for you. It offers so much more than simply listing all the names with definition in alphabetical order. Not only does it group names in a way that makes sense, if you already have a child, it offers names that are good sibling names for the name that you have already picked. It is amazing how accurate it is. I had a middle name picked out and I found the perfect first name to go along with it by looking up the middle name. Amazing book."
4,Nice tools; not enough names,"This is far better than the average baby book. I especially like the ""popularity tracker"" that charts how common a given name has been over the past several decades. The ""sibling names"" feature is also handy (suggesting names that are similar in character to a particular name).My primary complaint is that not enough names are represented here; expanding the lexicon would be the most useful improvement to this book."
5,"Excellent tips for naming, and a good selection of names!","Wattenberg definitely gives practical tips for what you want to avoid or look for when naming your child. I especially found the popularity numbers and frequency graphs to be useful, as we were trying not to go too trendy or popular with our next child's name. She gives a great snapshot of lots of names, but purposely leaves out some that are extremely similar to others. The style categories make lots of sense and give a vast array of names you may never have heard of. All in all, this is a wonderful resource for ""why"" we name what we do, and what works and what doesn't. We still can't decide on a name, but that's not Wattenberg's fault! Great book!"
3,"Personally, not helpful.","This was a nice book, but it didn't do much for us. If you're completely undecided about a name, it might help you; but if you have any names you like then you will probably pick a name from that list so a book won't be helpful. I'm glad it was different from other name books. Just wish it was available at libraries or Barnes and Noble so I could've previewed it better."
2,Meh,"There weren't a lot of names in this book. I liked that it included the names popularity. Overall, the book was pretty much useless to me, though. My husband and I found no new names to consider. There just wasn't enough to this book. I've had much better luck simply browsing the internet for FREE."
4,Good Resource,This book really helps narrow down al of the names out there. If you are completely overwellmed and don't know where to start this is a great baby name book.
4,Probably better in paperback,I bought this book for my kindle. It's got good info and has been very helpful in naming my baby but I find it hard to search and find the name I'm looking for quickly due to the fact that it's an e-book and when I search it brings up every time the name is mentioned rather than the main entry first so I have to go through all the other places in the book first to find what I'm looking for.
4,Good book,Good book. Very interesting to read as it is different than most of the name books out there. This book will give you many ideas for names of babies.
4,Good book but...,"I agree with others that this is a well written book. I like how the author pairs up complementary names for siblings and discusses the name's popularity. However, I was hoping this book also had meanings for the names as well. So if you're looking for a good book that discusses the meaning behind names, skip this one. However, if you're looking for an interesting baby name book discussing the waxing and waning popularity trends and offering suggestions for sibling names, then give this book a try. :)"
3,Not for people who want a different name,"This is not a book for those of us looking for names that are a little different, creative, or from different ethnic backgrounds. If you like pretty normal sounding names, this might be your book--otherwise it doesn't have enough options. Not many names from different languages and other countries."
4,Very interesting,"This book does not contain as many names as some other book or even traditional meaning, but it does give useful information about each name. The auther gives auther gives information about the image of the name. The information about the popularity of the name over the years is very good to know."
3,The Baby Name Wizard,"This book is great for people who know what type of name they want and simply need to look at a categorized list to find it. Among the many categories provided are Italian names, Latino names, Celtic names, 80's names and ""porch sitters"", or names that are not likely to experience revivals anytime soon. The book also provides possible sibiling names and alternative spellings for names that are featured in it. Be advised that some of the names that appear in the categorized lists do not appear in the main part of the book.Despite its numerous categories and lists, the book fails to provide a wide range of names that appeal to various tastes and styles. It provides information about older names such as Deborah and Susan and those which are ultra trendy like Madison and Jayden. If you're looking for a middle ground or perhaps something a little different, your best bet is to spend your money elsewhere."
1,ok,"It is an ok name book. I think that it would be great for naming pets, but not my baby. I was looking for a book that would have names and their meanings. I'm not really all about matching names with sibling names, but if you are, this might be the book for you."
2,Not amused,"The names in this book are so plain and un-original. If I needed help thinking of John for a name, I think I'd have bigger problems on my plate! Didn't like and wouldn't recommend."
2,It's OK,"Not the best baby name book I've seen. There's nothing really overly exciting about it. It's OK, not that bad, but not the greatest. Kinda disappointing to be honest and not what I had expected."
1,BUY AT YOUR OWN RISK!,"What a shame this is a great baby name book, but I bought two different copies at different times and the spine of both COMPLETELY fell apart . (the books were carefully read and not abused) I don't know if it was a bad production run at the print house ? Incredibly frustrating."
3,It's OK for a name book,"I think all name books are kind of dumb since I haven't picked names out of a book. It's kind of like picking a tattoo off wall. It's fine if you're not very creative and like to go with the ""in"" things. If you want a baby naming book, this is pretty decent."
2,not what I expected,"So after reading all the wonderful reviews, I did not hesitate to order the book. Needless to say, I was disappointed. Waste of money! Sorry."
3,Helpful - but baby is still nameless,It has not helped us to get a name. Let's you know the popularity of a name.
1,boring,too long. i have no idea what the point of this book was. i hated it so much i couldn't get through the first chapter.
2,Constant Repetition,I bought this book based on other user's reviews and I wish I had saved my money. We used the book looking for baby names but constantly ran into the same names over and over again. The repetition was annoying. The name Riley is listed 32 times and the name Beatrice is listed 26 times. Only the truly bizarre names are listed once. The book claims to have thousands of enchanting names but that's a stretch. Another disappointing fact about this book is it does not give you the meanings of the names so you have to refer to other books or the Internet for that information. I would not recommend this book.
5,Great book!,"I love this book! The author does more than define the names listed. She categorizes them, she shows recent trends, lists similar names to suggest alternatives, and she gives her opinion of each name without insulting or talking down to the reader. It's a great book for soon-to-be parents or anyone that's interested in names. The only slight problem is the fact that the book has been out for about two years, so the trends shown may no longer be entirely accurate, but you'll still be able to get a general idea of the popularity (or lack thereof)."
4,Very enjoyable,"I really like this book because it groups the names by type. If you like the name Philip, for example, you will find it among a list of other names, both boy and girl, that have the same type of ""feel"" about them. Names can appear on multiple lists. The names are listed alphabetically with a graph showing popularity in the last 100 years, plus there are lists of names by type at the end. Scattered througout, there are lists of the top names in different decades. I see what they are trying to do with this book, and I appreciate it. I know they were trying to create a different kind of baby name book, but I still would like a couple of words on the origin of each name. Then it would be a comprehensive baby name book."
4,A Step Above Others,"I bought this book after reading the rave reviews and when it came, I couldn't resist seeing what the excitement was all about! The introduction was especially helpful in pointing out common pitfalls when selecting names. The tone is light, fun and comical, which was refreshing. I like the organization of the book especially the categories of names in the back. However, I was disappointed to find a lack of more ethnic names. Also, the idea of giving name suggestions for brothers and sisters is a unique feature of this book, but I'm not completely sold on the idea of using one child's name to select a sibling name that fits into a prescribed category or ""flavor."" Overall, this book is a step above sifting through 10,000 baby names, but it's not the ""wizard"" I expected it to be."
4,good,"for the beginner to run this entire course through, these books get you off to the right start, and keep you going"
4,For Beginners,This method of teaching is good because they use simple notes that are large and then write the name of the note within it.The songs are cute and simple offering information in a fun way.I like this book. I use it to teach children under 10.
1,Way too easy!,"I took piano lessons when I was 12. My teacher used this book and after my first year of lesson I stopped.15 years after I took piano lessons again. I showed my new teacher this old book and he told me it is a piece of crap.Now I can see why I dropped my piano lessons when I was a kid: this book is too easy! Each score has full numbering for the fingers, so instead of reading the score I was reading the numbers! Moreover, the last scores have no difficulty at all."
3,Visio 2000 For Dummies,The book is most definitely for 'Dummies'. A very basic and limited overview of the Visio 2000 topic with little detail offered for the reader beyond a brief introduction to the subject. Leaves me looking for my next Visio 2000 book.
5,Wonderful CD!,I had a feeling this might be a good one and I'm thrilled with it. Shawn is an incredible songwriter.KAC
2,Not even close!,"Not even close to ""Cover Girl"" or ""Steady On"". The songs on this album all sound the same. And this album is all studio work. Shawn is best when she's performing all by herself, or when she has a small band behind her."
3,Well Worth A Listen,"Shawn's latest worthwhile effort offers poetically poignant lyrics framed by reserved but potent musical accompanyment. Her expressive, yet somewhat nasally, voice sounds as good as ever and the songs are well crafted and heartfelt, however if you're hoping for gems with a great hook and dynamics comparable to Shawn's ""Sonny Came Home,"" ""Get Out of This House,"" or ""Suicide Alley"" you may be somewhat disappointed."
5,Another wonderful gift from one of our purest talents,"At times rueful, angry, sad and hopeful, Shawn Colvin's new release paints a musical landscape of deep introspection and timeless beauty. Her words penetrate the active listener, a verse, chorus or phrase may touch one of us more than another depending on what life has dealt us (or we've dealt ourselves!), but be assured that there is something here for all of us. John Leventhal (whom I saw a few weeks back onstage with his beautiful and talented wife and musical partner, Rosanne Cash), is, and always has been, a perfect match for Shawn's musical voice. Together, and surrounded by a typically great list of musicians, they have created another masterwork."
5,Keepin' Her Fan Base,"I've always been a Shawn Colvin fan. Since her earliest CD her music spoke to me. I've seen her live dozens of times, cried my eyes out to ""I Don't Know Why"" (off of Fat City) and waiting with bated breath for each new CD. Her life seems so interesting and full of brave decisions, hard earned lessons and through it all an innocent sweetness like ""it'll all work out."" Am I reading too much into an artist I don't even know? Maybe. But this new album is more of the same yet completely different and beautiful. ""Fill Me Up"" is gorgeous, plaintive and worth playing over and over, as well as ""These Four Walls"" and ""So Good to See You.""I can tell that having a child has changed Shawn in a profound way, made her more in awe of life and more aware of how quickly it passes. But, if you're a parent, you'll agree, how can it not?I love this CD."
3,"Willing artist, shallow material","Colvin's seduction lies in her voice, at once oddly piquant and straight-faced, a twang that nicely embodies her cast of yearners, scrappers and outcasts. Her long time producer John Leventhal knows just to frame it, from the opener's (""Fill Me Up"") percussive take on needy assertion to the keening, dissonant refrain of ""Summer Dress."" Still, memories of her better albums (Cover Girl, Whole New You) make this enterprise sound as if she stopped at the 1st, or 2nd drafts, lyric-wise. The songs refuse to stick, or most egregiously, haunt, like her best."
3,One of the few books available on this topic,"I had to buy this book for a class. While doing research for that class, I would search the internet for restoration topics. Google returned googlebooks results and this one was near the top. I don't know of other resotration books that focus on repairing damaged areas using the process oriented approach. I would not have bought this book had it not been for a class, but overall it was an interesting read and I would recommend it for anyone interested in restoration ecology or ecology in general."
4,Uphill Battle,"Joshua Alexander Harrington of central Texas exemplifies what corporate Americans should all be like. He's more than 100 % committed, hard working, educated, positive and driven. FINALLY he was at the peak in his career where he was going to coagulate his continued rise to the very TOP.Before Josh has the chance to bask in his wonder, the vultures are stirring around to hold him back. Through all of this Josh will begin to question his fate, his love, his self as well as the law. Can Josh prevail?CORPORATE DECEIT is bursting with fraud, treachery and self doubt. As Josh tries to restore himself he must first learn his own self worth.Richard Carter does a wonderful job itemizing CORPORATE DECEIT. My only complaint is again the editing. In certain areas it became complicated; rest assured the particulars will surely keep you vested.I absolutely recommended for those readers in search for something dissimilar."
4,Fountain that birds love,This cascading fountain works beautifully. It blends in with surroundings being brown. I have it set up next to a bird feeder cage set in my window which has reflective film on it . That way I can stand very close to the birds without them seeing me. Since installing the fountain the birds have increased coming to feeder. Not only birds but a family of squirrels also use it.If a little care is taken with fountain such as cleaning it regularly and using a little bleach and cleaning pump screen it should last a very long time. The fountain was delivered in good time and it all remained intact . Easy to set up. Very pleased with service and product
1,"Hokey, not worth the bucks","First, it is very small, and just fades into the outdoor background. They should show a picture of it in a garden, you'd see what I mean - it looks great in their picture, with a solid taupe background.Second, it only works when there is bright sun, and then provides only a slow dribble of water.Third, leaves and garden debri must be cleaned out regularly, because there is no filter supplied and the smallest bit of dirt will clog the tube.If it had been easy to take apart and repackage, I would have returned it. But now, I just use it as a dog bowl."
1,Nightmare,"This fountain ONLY works when the solar panel is in direct sunlight. I have to move it all day to keep the fountain going. THe panel does NOT charge so it does not run at night either. THe water is stagnent more than it is running.Also, the 'pots' are delicately resting on the metal rings and very easily fall off.Would never recommend."
3,O.K.,"Kim better thank her lucky stars for Biggi. I really think if it wasn't for Biggi this albun would have been garbage. Most of the tracks stand out which is a good sign, but you get tired of her materialistic jargon."
5,She Can't Be Stopped,"Lately these days I can't seem to stop playing Lil Kim. I was just playing this album today & after 9 years since the release of ""Hardcore"" its still in the category of my top favorite cd's. She did her thing she stays repping for her hometown which is Brooklyn. Miss Kim is gone be around for a long time she's fiyah. Buy this if your a fan of her every Kim fan should have it."
4,Lil Kim's ..15 minutes of Fame,"LiL Kim's debut album ""Hard Core"" was solid. The beats and lyrics were hot. Of course Biggie produced and wrote most of the album but yo...she sounded good over the production. Lil mama can flow without a doubt..."
1,"""Bendover kim & Let me do it to yah seen"" 14thApril99","Kim is nothing but a big time Hoooore. Yo kim if you reading this let me say this to you wear some cloth next time before you come on any stage, Because first you haven got a good fit body to show off lik my girl, Second thing is that you are not prity at all. But after all you can sing & rap sometimes good and give for that one point see u next timeLove & peace from mr lover......"
4,Lil' Kim at her finest,"This is definitely Kim's best album. Alot of people say it's because BIG was writing alot of her stuff. At first I didn't want to believe that but after listening to the stuff she has dropped ever since his death, I've had to realize that maybe that notion was true."
5,Getting stung by the Queen Bee...Buzzzzzzzzz,"Lil Kim IS the Queen Bee, and there is no doubt about that! Just when you think men were the only ones who go hardcore, think again! And you will once you listen to Lil Kim. This is one of hip hop's greatest albums and Lil Kim is, without a doubt, one of the best female artists ever! This is a must have for sure!"
3,It Could Be Better,Lil' Kim's voice is what I like to hear. But she needs to stop behaving like a Slut!!!! I think she gives black women especially rappers a bad name. Her album is nothing short of a porn cd instead of music. The song 'Not tonight' is a very sick example.
4,"""U wanna be this Queen Bee, butcha' can't be, that's why ya mad at me.""","I must say, I am a HUGE fan and have been for many many years. I have nothing in common with the chic, but I like her flow and I respect her boldness... I love ""Big Momma"" on this cd, very hot track... the whole cd is hot, I give it 4 stars because I was not TOTALLY impressed with the lyrical genius of it, but overall, it is what it is... It's Lil Kim... she is a woman who defied the odds and she gets much love and respect."
1,"Momma, Don't let Your Daughters Grow Up to Be Skeezas...","...or female hustlas. Why don't Kim just drop the formalities and just do adult videos? By going that route, she just may save herself from the diminished returns/planned obsolescence laws quite evident for rap artists and their products. Just may..."
3,Great voice that needs to be washed with soap,"Lil Kim has an excellent voice, and her style is one that fits perfectly with the beats. Too bad she took the low road with lyrics that are foul and trampy. Yes, I dig ""Big Mamma Thang"", ""Crush on You"" and ""No Time"". But it would not have compromised her ability as a rapper to produce the songs without the crass lyrics."
1,DOWNFALL OF A TALENTLESS FELON,"Hopefully Lil Kim's recent conviction and jail sentencing will end this so called career. It's sad that human garbage like this could sell even one record. But the truth is, is she has sold her soul to the devil at the expense of millions of young and impressionable kids, mainly African-American who quite frankly would be better off without such terrible role models."
1,IMMORAL INFLUENCE,how sad it is that many sisters are living a life styal of sexuall immorality.how internal hell awaites many bothers and sisters if they dont repent from there sins and ask for forgiveness from the lord and be saved from the wrath to come-REJECT CHRIST AND ULL REGRET IT!turn from your sins and be saved!
3,the real queen bee?,"i will admit that this cd was actually pretty good and some things have to be admitted. the fact that the only content on the album is sex and drugs, having sex after drugs, and having sex while high on drugs. songs like ""queen b@#$h"" and ""mafia land"" are tottally awesome i listen to them all the time. and then there is ""spend a little doe"" and that is werid but a really good track. she trys to be like other rappers though like biggie, foxy brown, and puff daddy. she can flow though and can do better with her own style. i really like what she did on songs like ""crush on you"" and ""we don't need it"". the song ""no time"" is terrible. one thing she does though is use the same raps everytime like ""big momma thang"" and ""just like me"" (featuring usher). whats up with that? personally i believe the best female rapper is missy ""misdemenor"" elliott. this is overal a good cd"
1,Er....I'll just toss this aside,"Nothing different about Lil Kim from the other struggling female rappers out there. She needs a new image, and a new style, not to mention some shame."
1,Should not have been advertised since its no longer available,"Amazon was good about forwarding information about the lack of this product as they understood it, but the distributor should have told them this product had been discontinued. It was weeks before I found that out, and I only discovered that through GNC and local gyms."
2,waaaay over my head,"I read a lot of books but this one was so way over my head that I skimmed major portions, which I just never do. It was a difficult read. There were a few chapters that I read entirely, but I still don't know really how to explain what it's about."
2,"It's good enough, I suppose.","If you're really having trouble with the Ranger game, this is worth your time. Otherwise, I wouldn't really recommend it. The maps are probably the best feature, since I tend to get turned around in the caves and forests you have to navigate through. The ""Pokemon Browser"" at the back helps when you're at a loss as to which pokemon you need to get past, say, a huge boulder or a fence.The big downer about this guide is that they dont say anything about the special manaphy mission! You can get that online if you search for it.Ultimately, other than what I listed as features, this guide is rather useless. Try to find a website that has a guide, instead."
5,please check out stockmangrassfarmer.com,"this book is available brand new, not ""nearly new"" from the stockman grass farmer bookshelf (Mr. Nation`s publication) for $35.50, not $40.00. Please be wary of some used book sellers."
4,More Menken Magic,"Alan Menken is a master when it comes to composing songs - as well as composing film scores. Life with Mikey (aka Gimme a Break) is another fine example of his amazing creative talents at work. The movie was highly underrated and worthy of a greater audience - with stars Michael J. Fox, Nathan Lane, Cyndi Lauper. There are some wonderful tracks on this CD. If you like Menken, you will want to add this one to your collection."
3,Doctor at sea,"Aleesha Gautier is a naval doctor who decides to spice up her life and join an all female naval special ops team, the Medusa project. This is a mission uniquely suited to the team as the terrorists who have captured the cruise ship have let the men go.It's not quite a thriller and not quite a romance but it falls somewhere between the two stools. While an interesting thiller it sometimes read like the author was ticking off boxes for the plot and it didn't really look like the rest of the team was doing that much while the main character got centre stage.Aleesha is a strong character and knows her own mind, her team are all strong women used to competing with men and not willing to back down if they think they're right. The Hijacker that she gets involved with leaves her a little confused because she's not sure whether she should trust him or whether he's trying to fool her.Diverting but nothing special."
3,Facist Italy and Nazi Germany: Comaprisons and Contrasts,This book would be good for a historical scholar who is writing a thesis on the subject but it was well beyond my comprehension. Parts of it are interesting but it is a very difficult read to say the least.
5,Great rat bed,I ahve four male rats so I needed to have several places for them to sleep in their cage. I wanted something big enough to hold all 4 in case they wanted to all sleep together and this bed comfortable holds all four of them if hey want to sleep together. It stands up and keeps its shape well and they seem to love this bed. I know it was meant for ferrets but rats and other small animals will also love this.
1,Super Pet Ferret sleeper,My pets didn't like the material that was used on the outside of the bed. So they wouldn't use them.
2,Not Quality!,"This was a nice bed but, a year later my guinea pig's bed is in shreds from the washing machine! And, it was on the gentle cycle. Even if your piggy is not a chewer spend your money somewhere else! Your guinea pig could choke."
4,Turn it upside down for shy guinea pigs,"My new guinea pig will only interact with this bed if it is upside down. I tried placing his treats in it upright to get him to lay in it but he likes the igloo better. I took the suggestion of someone else on here and turned it upside down, now this is his main nap spot!It's nice and fuzzy on the inside and will provide good insulation for the winter time. At least 2 full size guinea pigs could sleep in this thing or even a kitten (not cat, a baby kitten) could sleep in this comfortably. Hopefully you'll have a big enough cage for your piggy or ferret or other to run around this bed, it is big but in the right size cage it won't take up too much space."
1,Died with ONE wash,"Not only was it not as pictured, it arrived with a very strong smell. I tossed it in washer and dryer as per instruction and it came apart at the seams, I don't know if my piggies will like it, but what's the point when it fails with ONE single wash. Oh, and it still smells horrible after the wash."
5,great!,"I love the cuddle cup so does my piggies,the only thing i would've like if it would have came in a pattern not just a solid color,but i like the the color is very bright and vibrant,my piggies love it,they both use it very differently the one in the picture only lays on it when the sides are folded under him odd ? :p and my other piggie like sleeping under the cuddle cup and sometimes does the same thing his brother does,laying on the sides,overall great product,i love it when Fedex ships i always get my stuff the next day before 12pm (:"
1,Nothing like pictured....,"item pictured shows white fleese, item received is furry. I am stuck with it. if I return it, I have to print label ( we have no printer) or I can drop off. We have one car....so that is not going to happen. if they send someone to pick it up, they will deduct 6.00! NOT happy....this item is not just a different color, but material is completely different!"
5,Great documentary!,"My girls are interested in cheerleading so we got this DVD. It is a true-life documentary and not a ""fluffy"" scripted movie. I would recommend it for 8 and older. It is interesting and funny. I think it is a great depiction of what cheerleading is. It shows how hard teenagers can work to achieve winning as a team. The girls really represent a positive attitude for today's youth. I would recommend this video for any child who is thinking of a team sport -- not just cheerleading."
4,Fascinating Book,"My wife bought this years ago at a used book sale and it sat in the shelf until a week ago when I read it. It's a fascinating book and illustrates how easily lies get ""a life of their own"" when basic fact checking is overlooked.It's over 45 years since the events but the issues are timely. Mr. Sheehan and his editors are to be commended for having the time and tenacity to get to the facts."
5,This is a very factual book about the USS VANCE,I was a radioman aboard the Vance from 1965-1968. Reading this book brought back many memories. Some good and alot of very tough times due to the unpredictable Arnheiter. He was a very strange person. This book is extremely accurate and very well written.
3,The Crusades: A Biographical History,"I am a homeschooler, and I bought this book because I was looking for something about the Crusades written specifically for younger children. This one fits the bill, although the language is rather dry and patronizing. It has some very nice illustrations and a few quotations from actual sources. I could see this book in a school library for 2nd-5th graders to use for research, but it is not the fun book I was hoping for. I'm not sure that I would recommended for homeschoolers."
4,motivating the cash potato to painlessly save and invest,"Meany's quick read shows the cash potato how to find money--even when you think there's none left over--and snag it and make it grow! Down-to-earth, funny, practical, and SIMPLE (""quick and painless,"" he keeps hammering), the book is well laid-out and well indexed. Even *you* have time to read this book!"
5,"Simple, sensual and universal!","Nizar Qabbani's poems have the ability to transport your imagination to the world of longings, passionate encounters and emotional and physical aspirations. His work is a true celebration of love, women, country and cities.The poem On Entering the Sea, on which the book's title is based on, is beautiful, simple and deep. Here are some verses:""Love happened at lastWithout intimidation... with symmetry of wish.So I gave... and you gaveAnd we were fair.It happened with marvelous easeLike writing with jasmine water,Like a spring flowing from the ground.""His poems are glowing, emotional, sensual, pleasing and universal."
5,A Terrific Shaver,"This is definitely the best shaver I have ever owned. The motorin this shaver is very strong and powerful. I have a tough beard and it shaves as close as a blade, just like the Remington slogan says. Also, the features that come with the shaver are great too."
1,Pop-up trimmer is a problem....,"The cleaning system is very innovative. But the pop-up trimmer is very uncomfortable, and 'bites' the skin. I am not very impressed with the shaver's shaving ability on the whole. Takes too long for a complete shave. Previous models were alot better. I am VERY disappointed in this product."
2,In the garbage it goes.,"The self cleaning concept was the reason I bought this razor. The razor cleans and lubricates automatically and the price for consumables was not bad. After owning the razor for two months I noticed that the red indicator light on the cleaning base was on after I had just refilled the fluid. After a closer inspection I found out that the fluid had leaked out all over, and this fluid destroys everything it touches that isn't metal or plastic. I thought maybe I had done something to cause the problem so I refilled the cleaning base and started the cleaning process. Immediately the fluid in the base started spewing out of the cracks where the top of the base and the bottom of the base come together. It is now headed to the landfill. The trimmer does not work well either."
2,MS-5700 NEEDS TO GO BACK TO THE DRAWING BOARD,"I have found that the MS-5700 to be very loud. The Braun 8995 that I replaced it with is very quiet. The plastic chrome on the body gives it a very cheap feel, and look, it makes it hard to hold onto. I have found that the shaver dosn't give me a very close shave compared to the Braun 8985 shaver. The solution tank for the cleaner seems to be not as user friendly as the Braun 8985 that holds a cartridge that slips in and out to replace. As you have read I have replaced the MS-5700 already with the Braun 8985, and am very happy with the change. The Braun also came with 3 cartridges for the cleaner unit, not just one bottle to pour into the cleaner."
2,What???,This thing was so much bigger than my crib. You can't even try to make it fit cuz its so big. My crib is a 24 x 38 but this things got to be a 28 x 42. Make sure you got a big crib before you buy this mattress protector.
1,Phares' book is extremely biased,"Lebanese Christian Nationalism is an excellent resource for those seeking to learn more about Christian myths. Not only does the author present a very biased view of the Lebanese civil war, but he also presents the unfounded argument that Lebanon has always been Christian and is only for Christians.This book is in-line with the author's political views, which are to regenerate an exclusively-Christian movement in Lebanon including the revival of the Syriac language. The value of this book is only seen in its demonstration and promotion of typical Christian nationalist thought."
5,a good book for beginers and old fans alike,this book was suprisingly very good. I really liked that it had a work out to follow and tips on playing from the pros to get you started playing hockey. It is also imformative for new hockey fans and fans like myself who have loved the game for some years now
3,Not really what I had expected,"As an adult playing hockey for the first time at 40, I was expecting more of a ""how to"" book. This was full of interesting facts about the sport, but less about how to play, techniques, and strategies."
3,Hockey for Dummies,"If you are a hockey notive and are looking for the basic rules and regulations, this book is fine. As far as today's hockey, I think it is outdated. I did not recognize but a few of the players mentioned. I realize that the world of hockey is fast moving. Since I did not pay full price for this book, it was worth the money I paid."
3,Satisfied,"Though it wasn't received as quickly as I had hoped, it was in excellant condition and well handled!"
3,Hockey for Dummies,"Covers a little of all of the basics of the game. I didn't expect great detail, but some of the subjects needed to be covered in more detail"
2,Definitely for Dummies,"For those who know nothing at all about hockey this may be a useful introduction, and that is apparently its purpose. It is rather shallow. Want to know what a ""left wing lock"" is? Or what the penalties are? Or what the basic theories of offense and defense are? Or even what the rules are? You can learn a very little about them from this book. But you'll learn more just by listening to the television announcers. Those familiar with the fine ""For Dummies"" series will expect more and may well be disappointed."
4,No Longer a Dummy!,"Hockey For Dummies was incredibly helpful when my son began playing the sport and we ended up getting so hooked that we started attending collegiate as well as professional hockey games. Nothing like a bunch of new hockey moms inquiring, ""what is icing?"" to which another replies, ""it's something you put on a cake.""The book's format was very easy to follow, so no matter what you want to learn (penalties, history, etc.) you will be able to get a no-nonsense answer to your inquiry. Understanding something about the sport makes it much more enjoyable to watch. I was particularly impressed with the guidelines for watching the games in person versus the televised ones."
4,This Book was Excellent,"Living in the United Kingdom its always going to be differcult to get some t.v coverage on the marvellous game ,nevermind getting a book with as much depth and coverage as this,I found this book to be very informant as well as being worded so a relative novice could understand its terminology. This definatly gets a thumbs up from me and i heartly recommend it...."
5,I've read Senlin: A Biography,"Since no one else has reviewed it, I'll put in my two cents. This particular poem although long is very intriguing. Even my English teacher had some trouble interpretting it. I initially came in contact with it as L'Engle quoted it in one of her books. I've heard great things about a number of his poems so I'm sure this book is great as well."
3,Required for Courses...,"This book has an interesting way of presenting the material, but it is lacking in depth and is often not helpful.There are quite a few occasions where an important concept is not explained or is explained poorly.Also, the index is confusing and poorly organized."
2,Fragmented,"I enjoy doing both grammar, algebra and statistics formulas, so I am accustomed to following logical sequences. I am on Chapter 8 and am giving up on this book. I find it fragmented. The paragraphs she writes do not stand on their own and create an idea. A fragment of an idea is thrown out, in the form of a question, and then you must go to the end of the book, read the answer and then try to figure out what she was trying to ask.I was hoping for a detailed explanation of a topic followed by examples and then questions to work on your own."
1,Pretty but useless... save your money.,"This cutting board is an absolute waste of money. I read reviews of the larger cutting board that mentioned significant warping, but didn't find any such reviews for the 12-inch square cutting board. I just wanted a nice, good-looking board to complement my Wusthoff knives (which I love). To be safe, I oiled the board every day for a week before using it and planned to continue once a week for a month and then monthly after that to protect the board... but I never got that far. Just one mild wash after the very first use with soap and water followed by immediate drying, and the board has completely warped into a shallow bowl shape... completely useless and an absolute waste of $39.99!"
4,Great Shoes,These shoes are VERY comfortable. I love them. One problem is that the heel is wearing down very fast. I'll have to have them fixed and I've only had them for a month.
3,Shoe Review,Not bad for the price. I guess I need to break them in as they are hurting my feet at this point.
5,Excellent price for Clark shoes,I have been wearing Clark shoes for over 10 years. The service and price on the purchase of two pair of Clark shoes I purchased was EXCELLENT!! I recommend to everyone to shop at Amazon.com. This was my first purchase and I am totally impressed by the service provided by Amazon.
2,"Look good, feel bad",I'm a long time fan of Clark shoes--sturdy and comfortable. But it seems that they're trying to by flashy and in doing so have compromised comfort.
5,SUBARU-KUN!!!,"X is a beautiful series, which seriously attempts to be an epic in a heartfelt manner (and I only say ""attempt"" because I'm an english major and have read the real epics). X doesn't just show, it reads. The viewer leaves every episode feeling fulfilled and craving more. This DVD made me especially excited, however, because of the first serious appearence of Subaru-kun, the star of one of my favorite animes, Tokyo Babylon. If you've gotten this far in the series, seriously consider purchasing Tokyo Babylon, to fully understand the tragedy of the encounters of Subaru-kun and Seshiro. If you haven't seen X at all, what are you waiting for, silly? Get Vol. One NOW!!! :)"
1,Please avoid this book.,"This book is offensive and have little historical pertinence to the topic.The author recently wrote and article for an Italian news paper and he continued writing about how Sicilians have lower IQ compared northern Italians, which by the way, they are all second generation Sicilians accordingly to the latest Census. So, as I said this guy should focus more on Irish internal affair such as terrorism in 2010 form a civilized national like his rather than writing stupidity about world IQ, do not waste any money and read more realistic and interesting book."
2,Interesting but probably rendered obsolete by the Flynn effect,"This is an unfair review since this book was published back in 2002, but the key ideas of this book may have been rendered obsolete by James Flynn's new paradigm on IQ, which he describes in ""What is Intelligence"" (2007). The Flynn effect basically observes that raw IQ scores have risen dramatically world-wide over the past 50 years- not on all test questions- but on the abstract ones- the ones that suposedly best reflect innate intelligence. IQ does reflect heredity, but it also reflect several other factors so it's essentially an achievement test then. (Recent work on epigenetics- gene switches- also cast further doubts on the conclusions of ""Wealth"".)If Flynn is proven right, then in the future, your IQ will be like your current salary as opposed to the convention that IQ represent some kind of maximum cap."
2,"Lies, Damned Lies and Statistics","Well.. What is IQ? Even relatively speaking, it should only classify people between Haves and Have Nots. Its low IQ to think that national IQ average can predict wealth of nations."
1,Not scientific,"The sample sizes are low; test subjects involves different economic backgrounds for different countries. The authors seem to have little knowledge of statistics or mathematics. Some of the results are crazy, for example Israel is supposed to have a mean IQ of 94(6 points less than the UK!!)Apart from low quality, the book could do a lot of damage to young minds."
1,Rumba Blouse,Unfortunately it is impossible for me to rate this product as over a month later I still have not received it and therefore had to improvise my costume for the party I attended
1,Cheapest Balls Ever,"This has happen on 2 occasions when using this paint,At first i thought i got a bad shipment when i got it because they was soft and was un-shootable! BUT I ran out of paint when doing a game and my friend gave me a box of the same kind it was EXACTLY THE SAME!! This paint isnt even worth getting for target practice,much less a game,unless you freeze them but even then they suck but if you do that DO NOT AND I REPEAT DO NOT USE THEM IN GAMES SHOOTING OTHERS! Due to it being a soft shell it always and i mean ALWAYS chops. About the only good thing about these is the colors."
4,Ok,Its ok paint but its cheap and for a little extra money you can buy better paint but it is good for the price
5,Going in a new-not wrong- direction,"Alright, I know a lot of fans who liked Tragic Kingdom and Beacon Street Collection hate Return of Saturn. But really! ND is simply trying new things, reinventing, etc, not turning into some lousy pop band. They ought to be commended for branching out as artists, not criticized. Return of Saturn is different from the ska albums No Doubt has done-for one it's more new wave- but different does not mean bad. I will always love No Doubt, even if others don't. They are original and never boring, and anyone who says Gwen Stefani can't sing is either deaf or has never seen American Idol. This CD rules!"
5,amazing followup,"I liked No Doubt during Tragic Kingdom but didn't really jump on the bandwagon and liked them cause everyone seemed to though I could tolerate them. Once the songs from Return of Saturn were released, I began to respect them as artists because it seemed to me that they had expanded creatively, and even furthermore on Rock Steady. The best song on here in my opinion is Bathwater though I like them all to an equal degree. This album is much better than Tragic Kingdom too though it was their biggest album. Every artist who does a follow up to their biggest album always works twice as hard and musically it pays off, Return of Saturn is a great example of this"
5,A Swinging Album,A teriffic combo that immediately starts your foot to tapping. The vocalists are Class Acts. This is a record that you'll play over and over again.
3,"Extensive review from snow country, Michigan.","This shovel is built like a tank. It will last for years. Now, for review purposes I'm 6 ft tall... You can tell it's designers never used it or they were 4 ft tall because it's handle is too short. Also the steel is not bent/formed enough. This causes you to have to push it with the handle really low to the pavement. Ie, the angle is wrong.Your back will hate it!"
4,Very heavy duty,"This is a very good, heavy duty shovel. Actually as the name states it's not a shovel it's a pusher. It's very heavy and once you get snow in it you can't lift it. Unfortunately the handle is very short. My husband isn't tall (5'5"") but he complained the handle was too short and he got a backache from using it. If the handle was a little longer it would be perfect for heavy, wet snow. Because of the weight it stays down on the pavement making it easy to push the snow off your drive or sidewalk."
1,Unhappy with Product,"There is no ""push"" part to this snow shovel. The angle of the handle is all wrong, additionally it is too heavy...:("
5,Catholic and Scholarly,"This book is an excellent defense of the inerrancy of scripture from a Catholic perspective. There seem to be very few books that are scholarly, faithful to the teaching magesterium, and popular, but this book delivers on all three accounts. Father Most is a world class biblical scholar, and he is able to deal with questions about the historical critical method, form criticism, and archeology among other issues. Fr Most puts the historical critical method in proper perspective, showing that there are good uses for it but that it is used improperly and hence we have all this confusion today. The only small criticism I have of it is that it is a bit disorganized. The chapters are very short and readable, but it isn't obvious that they are in the correct order."
1,"Out of date, 'strange' classification of snakes and poor photos.","I am guessing that this book is just old, so not going along with todays knowledge, and this is just another edition. One definitely can find some information in it, but I did not like it. Another positive is its visually attractive issue."
3,This book is outdated,"The photos are great but the information is a little outdated but it is still a good buy.I bought mine for only $2,00 plus shipping in very good condition and I would buy it again at that price."
5,?,"I would love to have this cd, i raccomand you people to download Tatoo of the sun, that's what i did and it's like the best song, i cant believe they put it out of the complete cd........ I mean it can't be better!"
2,No B Side,"I bought this thinking it had ""Tatoo of the Sun"" on it as the B side. Apparently not! If you are after the B side make sure you get one that says ""Tatoo of the Sun"" too!"
5,3EB Rocks!@#$%^&*(+_)(*&^%$#@,This is out of stock and I can't find it anywhere. I know this single rules cause I have a friend who owns but I can't find it anywhere because it has been out for such a long time. Anyone please email me and tell me where I can get it!!!!!
1,Speaker phone defective on all 3 phones,"I bought 3 of these for our office a couple weeks ago. Mine had a speakerphone that worked fine for 2 days, started breaking up on the 3rd day, and stopped working completely thereafter. Since I'm the only one that uses speakerphone I decided to swap out with one of the other 2 phones. Turned out the other two were also dead.I contacted Panasonic to see if there was some kind of setting to change and they confirmed that the phones were defective. Otherwise I liked the phones but defective speakerphones in 3 out of 3 is not a sign of quality."
1,The speaker feature doesn't work,"I purchased two of these phones. The speaker feature doesn't work on both of them. Unfortunately, we found out too little too late and could not return it. It is horrible not to be able to use the speaker. Prior to this phone, we had two lines phones that worked great. I would rate this phone a zero if I could."
5,"Great product, even better costumer service.............","Great product, even better costumer service. Nobody does Customer Service better than this company. I had questions regarding my order and I got an immediate response, extremely professional and caring. You can't go wrong with them......"
4,"Features, value quality, ease of use","Panasonic always makes a good product. This exceeded expectations with its ease of use and features, especially those features that allow the phones to work together."
1,Not Impressed,"This product was defective and never worked properly. It wanted us to turn left when right was appropriate. The directions popped up and were easy to use so I think if the product was working properly, it would be a great buy. We sent ours back and chose another brand."
2,Don't Get It,"I've had this device for about two years now. It's been nothing but a problem. At first, it worked perfectly but after about 6-8 months, it started to stop working. It doesn't register until after a few minutes, doesn't recognize where I am randomly, will direct me the wrong way and then recalculate the route. The maps are very outdated and I am constantly an ""unknown road"" or looking for ""unknown road"" (this happens on major highways!). I would look for something nicer because this may work for the short term but is not a long term investment."
3,Not good enough,"I was really pleased to get the Navman iCN item, but getting it to work is a real problem. The first problem, if I set off for a new address I could drive to it, about 5 miles, without it establishing a GPS link. In other words no life except it saying ""testing"". The second problem, it seems to have a problem working out where it is, then when it does these appeares to the brain inside the box, an intersection, which gets no response at all. Still, it does make sense on longer journeys than short ones."
5,"Info on sponging, stippling, blending and outlining","In Painting On Glass, applied arts specialist Penny Boylan provides an informative review of the techniques, materials, and paint selection relevant to creating images on a glass medium. Included is important ""how to"" information on sponging, stippling, blending and outlining that come into play with the twelve step-by-step projects for creating intricately designed vases, etched picture frames, hand painted jugs and glasses, frosted windows and door panels. Painting On Glass is ideal for the beginner and has much to offer even the more experienced artist in the medium."
4,A solid reference for engineering purposes.,"A very generalized, but complete manual covering all topics in the mechanical engineering field. All descriptions and explanations are kept brief and to the point. The explanations are just enough to make the reader understand the basics of what is needed for comprehension. The material is well organised. A good choice for a desktop reference book."
5,A Perfect Guide,"I'm an advanced student of Mechanical Engineering, and I'm reading this manual, and is one of the best reference guide I ever had. The great quantity of topics is a great help.So, if you want to have a guide with topics related with engeenering, the MARKS is what you need."
2,Good for browsing,"I've had this book for several years, but I found that it rarely had the formula I needed. However, it is fun to read, so if you just want to get some inkling of typical problems and solutions in fields outside your own specialty, then this is a good book to have."
3,"Ok, but not great...","As a mechanical engineer in an industrial plant, I have not found this book to be very helpful at all. I have, on occasion, found some useful information, but most of the times that I have attempted to use it, I have ended up turning to another reference source. Others may find it beneficial, but for your run-of-the-mill, manufacturing plant engineer, (like me) it supplied no such value."
3,"Love this brand, but this one is a little to large",I love this brand of spatula's. I have several of the red but needed a different color to keep my gluten free baking items separate from the rest of my kitchen utensils. These orange spatulas are just a little too big to comfortably use. They work okay for stirring stir fries or sauces but uncomfortable for scrapping batter from bowls. Product is a great quality but I personally think this size is too big to be useful in the kitchen.
1,Bad engineering,"This spatula is useless for anything but decoration. It's too fat in the top to be a good scraper. It's not designed to be a good stirrer, and I can't figure what it IS good for. The shape of the scraper end is esthetically pleasing, but also useless."
3,Huge,"This is a well made spatula however it is huge, way too large for me but I think they may have smaller one available. Next time I would order smaller one."
3,"Great for batter, not for custard","Nice heavy spatula, easy to maneuver, does an excellent job scraping batter, etc. out of bowls. However, I purchased this spatula for a specific purpose - to constantly stir custard during the cooking process over a low flame. If the tip were a bit more firm, the thickening custard would not have collected at the bottom of the pot during the stirring process. The soft, flexible tip just slid over the thickened custard rather than moving it along."
4,Finepix 6900z charger,"The Finepix 6900z camera original charger stopped working suddenly, but without knowing if the issue was with the camera or the battery, this was a cheap enough charger that would justify the buy. It took a little while to charge the batteries, but they seem to be holding pretty well now. I am glad to be able to use my camera again, though I had already bought a Nikon D300 to replace it. The only ""issue"" with the CTA mini-battery charger was that the first battery I charged in it got stuck and I had to use a screw driver to remove the battery. It may have been some sort of ""lock"" that I could not figure out how to unlock, but the subsequent batteries were charged well and were not locked. So far, the equipment has worked fine for me.P.S. I did not use the car charger yet."
3,Charges as intended,"I bought this because the charger for my camera no longer works for charging the battery. While it works perfectly fine when plugged into a wall outlet, the car charger adapter doesn't seem to work. I'm not sure if I got a faulty plug or what. But it is nice to be able to use my camera once again."
5,Lady Lupin's,Any deerhounder or lover of deerhounds will find this book delicious. The drawings are more than worth the purchase price.
5,Lady Lupin,"This is a very cute, funny book. Lady Lupin explains principals of etiquette to her puppies. Her daughter Lobelia breaks them all. The ilustrations are fun. The story is fun. The advice is, mostly, very sound. I hope the little girl I bought it for likes it as much as I do."
4,Give me more,"Heard the first cut on air, checked out the artist/album. Great if you like easy jazz, simple, uncomplicated. Some vocals. Overall, very nicely done. Would like to buy some other works by the same artist. Can't find out anything about artist or music company."
1,Watch Out! - They're going to stick it to you!,"I've had my razor with the cleaning station for a year now. The cleaning station failed in July, and they said they would replace it under warranty. They didn't. So I called them. They said - and, yes, I have this right - that the cleaner base was such a trouble-prone device, they stopped selling it, and now only sell the razor alone. And, they told me, since they no longer make the cleaning base, they no longer honor the two-year warranty. This is akin to buying a 2010 Ford, and Ford disallows all claims once they start selling the 2011 model, because ""they don't make that model anymore."" Yes, I'm unhappy. The razor never performed as well as did the Remingtons of old, all of which were (then) made in the good old USA."
1,remingtom ms5500,"i bought the ms5500 last week on amazon. it is a peace of crap!! it was charged as directed before use, the charge lasted less than a minute, charged it again and the same results!! I have an older remington model i was replacing but will send this piece of garbage back and get a refund. Will try another brand... tired of replacing the screens and blades on remington shavers.. they do not last !!!! yes i did clean them after every shave but it did not matter..i give this shaver minus 5 stars!!!"
3,Foiled Again!,"My first foil shaver. I last had a Norelco rotary-type, after decades of cutting myself with blades. Even after replacing the heads in the Norelco, it performed weakly, missed a lot of whiskers, too slow. The Remington is way faster and closer, but much noisier, and the battery life stinks. They claimed 50 minutes of operation, I believe. I'm lucky to get 15 minutes, 3 shaves at 5 minutes. As soon as the charge indicator reaches 60% it dies and the reserve never worked. Always keep the charging cord handy."
4,Very fast delivery,"After a few weeks of using and enjoying the Remington MS-5200 Titanium 700,I do recommend it.I ordered one Wednesday and next Tuesday I received the parcel at home in Barcelona Spain.Thanks Amazon."
1,Big waste of money,"This razor cost me $99, and it's a piece of junk.It's VERY NOISY, the foils are so thin that they have to be replaced a lot (and they're expensive), and the cleaning solution needs to be replaced every few weeks (more wasted money). On top of that, the TRIMMER DOESN'T WORK.Whoever designed this razor for Remington should be FIRED!On the other hand, maybe it was poorly designed on purpose, so Remington could rake in the bucks -- between the high initial purchase price and all the money us suckers have to spend on new foils and cleaning solution...DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS ONE."
1,"Cleaning system broke in 20 days, cannot shave along jaw line",Stay away from buying this shaver.The cleaning system unit broke within a month. Read a similar review of another buyer. The toxic cleaning fluid leaked from the system and spilled all over onto the sink on numerous occasions. The cleaning fluid is not cheap which you need to buy separately.The care guide does not provide address for me to ship the defect cleaner. I called the 800 number which took me a long time but was unable to connect.The shaver itself cannot shave closely along my jaw line and leaves a stubble which I need to shave with my separate blade shaver.DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT.
2,"Sorry, not impressed!","Ok, this was only me second razor, so you might want to say ""You know nothing yet boy!""Ya, I would understand that, but it's only my second because I have been using my first for almost a !DECADE! (27 now) and my first razor IS a Remington R 845. And the battery still lasts for over a week. So I said, DAMN I am gonna get another one of those.I had seen a lot of adds for the self cleaning foil shavers and said, what the hell, $100 for half that time, nooo problem.Well, first, this thing vibrates like a mother! My hand is numb after using it. And to top it off, sure, it does cut a bit closer, well, if you can call it cutting. I call it YANKING it out.After three months of trying to get used to it, I gave up and have gone back to my R 845 (now super glued in multiple places) and am looking for another razor."
3,MS-5500 Shaver,"Disappointed in quality considering price tag. I would have expected a more quiet operation, better shave and docking system. Many multiple passes required to shave everything. Bought to save time from razor and spending more time with this. Wouldn't mind if around the $30 range."
1,poor shaver,"From having to replace the screens every 6 months, to fluid every month, this is an expensive shaver. Add to that the extreme noise this thing puts out and not to good a shave you get I am ready to toss it in the trash."
2,"I love the way it shaves, but......","My wife got me this razor for christmas 2004. I have loved the way it shaves, but in the first three months the battery died. It would accept a charge. Remington promptly and courteously replaced my unit under warranty. Over the last few months the charge has lasted less and less time. This weekend, we went out of town and the razor was dead as a doorknob the first morning when I tried to turn it on. This morning I plugged it in to charge it, it got too hot to touch and the display turned black. I'm assuming that it is now deceased.While I love the way the razor works, I am very disappointed with the reliability, given the price."
3,Great Shaver with a poor cleaning system,"I have had many foil shavers, including the Braun model with a cleaning system as well. This Remington definitely shaves closer than any other I know. Yet the cleaning system worked well for less than 60 days, being on every other day.At a certain time the low fluid light started to flash, and I completed the volume. A week later, it happened again and I decided to clean the base, replace fluid and filterTwo days later the red LED started to flash again and I completed the fluid once more. This time I ran a cleaning cycle just to realize that, 30 seconds after starting, there was fluid all over the sink topA clear design flaw and I through the shaver away, since it would not worth the trouble repairing it"
5,Needed to replace the jack on my engine lift,In about 1/2 hour I had replaced the jack on my engine lift with this one. Perfect fit except for the holes on my lift were just a little bigger but because it lifts that is not a problem. A great value and it was delivered fast.
2,Three movies you never heard of....,"Mainly in response to the first (non-)""review"" I spent a while with the (grainy) image of the case artwork and the Internet Movie Data Base.The three films appear to be ""The Klansman"" (1974), ""Divorce His - Divorce Hers"" (w/ L. Taylor - 1973), and ""Green Grow the Rushes) (1951). While I'm not an expert on Burton movies, I don't recall any of these as having a reputation for excellence. As I got here following a search for ""Becket"" - which is magnificent, but not presently available on DVD - I share the earlier reviewer's concern."
1,what are the films?,It would help if you'd list the films in this collection so I could tell if I wanted to buy it.
1,This is lame!,"I got to this Triple Feature DVD offering on a search for Burton's MY COUSIN RACHEL. After 10 minutes of trying to figure out what 3 movies are contained in this set, I gave up and read a review to find the answer. I think it rather lame to offer three movies and not tell customers the names of the three movies."
2,Film Has Been Cut (WHY?),"Bought this triple DVD set from the States to the UK because I wanted a legit DVD copy of Green Grow the Rushes. Quality is no better than VHS, but the worst thing was though they have ""butchered"" Green Grow the Rushes, they have cut important parts of the film so it is NOT a complete film WHY? It is an innocent ""Ealing"" type of early 50's comedy film so what is the problem? Seems like I will have to still stick with my TCM copy from years ago until someone else takes it upon themselves to release a proper digital version."
2,mickey rooney triple feature,re-production quality was sub-par sound levels from each film where at diferent levels. but for the price that is the trade off ...it was neat to see old material still available.
1,Cheap springs! Spun right off end cap.,Installed two springs left and right. Raised my door and the springs started to unwind. The cones and screws were still heighten. Reinstalled did it again.
3,Major cons with some pros,"I'm not so pleased with this stroller. You have to recline the seat each time before folding it down. It is huge and heavy. I'm a fan of smaller strollers, so maybe it's just me that doesn't like the size. However, I couldn't even get in a fitting room at a department store because the stroller wouldn't fit through the door. I do like the parent tray, child tray, and pocket. Also, customer service is great. I contacted them with a couple complaints and they immediately went out of their way to make things better with offering to help. This is a stylish stroller and great if you just want to use it for walks outdoors."
4,its heavy but its okay:-),"[...] This stroller is really nice, its easy to assemble. Just push in the wheels and snap. But it is so heavy for me. Its 28lbs. And even though it folds up real nice and easy its huge. If i put it up in the passenger seat, it fills up the seat and some of the dashboard. The sacrifice for its modern look and elegant wheels. Its so easy to steer. With one wrist even. But again the only flaw is its huge and heavy. Just get it out and youll be good. Or have your husband deal with it. This is the best stroller i beleive thats out there. Most strollers are bulky and big. But at least this one makes it look good."
2,my3sons,"I bought this stroller when we no longer needed the double stroller. I always thought the double was large, heavy, and hard to move around. Amazingly, this stoller was just as hard, if not harder to pick up. It does not close very well and when closed, is huge. The front wheel lock broke within the first week and I have since put putty in to fill the hole and keep it from locking. Again, within the first week, the cover for the storage compartment on top broke off. I am very frustrated that I spent the money on this and did not go with a McClaren as I had originally planned to do. My final complaints, the recline is not upright enough - your child will have to lay back - and the stroller does not come apart to allow you to wash it (with the light colored fabric, the stains are very apparent). I do not reccomend this stroller!"

5,fun game for horse lovers,"a really fun board game with several optional ways to play. attractive pieces, easy instructions. a very nice group fun time."
4,Kids will Herd Together to Herd Their Horses,".A fun game that can be played very simply, or play can evolve to a more complicated level.Almost all kids love horses, and Herd Your Horses allow kids to get their favorite horses together in their own herds, on their own ranches!Allows good imaginative play, as well as thinking, counting, etc.Negative:Not readily recommended for kids much younger than that recommended ages. The rules are a little more challenging than some of the other games for the same age groups."
3,Fun game,Purchased this game for my Grandaughter who loves horses and is 8 years old. This game was played with Grandparents and was fun. She loves it.
3,May not recieve product,I ordered this product for my daughter and payed online with credit card. A month later I have still not recieved the game. I would not recommend ordering from this company online.
2,Promoting the Horse-related Art of Husbandry and Breeding,"For years I have tried to reproduce the fascinating world of horse breeding and training in my home, but this game makes it so much easier. The horses in the game are tiny and easily pushed around."
5,Neice Loves This,"We bought this game for our neice who is crazy about horses. She instantly loved it and it is a blast to play w/ her. She also enjoys playing it by herself, which is a wonderful asset in all toys."
5,fun!,"Once you get past the directions, game isn't like any other game, it's so much fun! Strategy, luck, simple but quick paced --has it all! Esp nice for horse lovers, cards are pretty too."
4,Daughter loves it,Games play pretty fast. Educational and fun for all those horse lovers. Good game to play with your kids for some quality family time.
3,Instructions are complicated,"This seemed like it could be fun, but I found the instructions so complicated that a child would struggle with them. My kids finally just made up their own rules and game with pieces and board."
5,Herd Your Horses! probably the best board game in the world!,"i got this game 4 my b-day about 2 years ago. i LOVE it!! i have a GREAT LOVE 4 HORSES. they are jsut sooooooooo coool!!i would recommend this game for ANYONE who loves horses. there are a lot of neat things in the world, and horses are DEFINATELY 1 of them!!!!!"
2,Only Minimal Play Value,"My cat will bat it a few times, then ignore it. If I put it away for a while and take it out, we repeat the process. Sounds like a good idea, but it doesn't work for us."
2,"Nice idea, poorly executed","This seemed like a neat idea, and my cat had fun with it for a short while. However, it was very easily pulled off the door-knob (I safety-wired it in place so it would stay put), and the pom-pom thing is not at all durable. Within a week, only a small shard of it remains on the string. Would have been a much better deal if the pom-pom wasn't so sorely lacking in durability."
2,Maybe the person who sizes these should be re-educated. Got an X-LRG. doubt it would even fit a med dog.,Maybe the person who sizes these should be re-educated. Got an X-LRG. doubt it would even fit a med dog. But was a good price. And arrived quickly.
1,"Great service from Amazon, but terrible product.","I bought my first Hopkins wiring kit for my 1999 Explorer at a local auto parts store. On the first fishing trip using this vehicle, the wires to the trailer got pinched between the bumper and the trailer. Instead of blowing the replaceable power fuse, the module quit working altogether.I bought the second wiring kit from Amazon. It was shipped promptly. On the first fishing trip with this wiring kit, the module started malfunctioning after the first launch upon plugging in the trailer lights after pulling the boat out of the water. One of the rear trailer lights stays on whenever the trailer lights are plugged in, and will not flash when the turn signal is on. I tried to contact the manufacturer after the first wiring kit malfunctioned, but never received a response. Unfortunately, I have not yet found another brand for my application."
1,Complete failure,"I had the same bad experience as the first reviewer. Passenger side light stays on all the time. Hopkins sent me a new one that worked for a week, then failed in the same way. Hopkins suggested that it had shorted internally and the permanent 12v supply was keeping the passenger taillight on.Can't find any others out there."
2,Christmas for a Kitten,"The only thing magical and heartwarming about this book is its illustrations, which are lovely. Otherwise, most of the narrative is spent describing a baby animal going through a horribly depressing series of events. As an adult, this little holiday book told me quite an upsetting tale. I can only speculate on how it would affect a child. Go buy the little tyke a copy of ""A Pussycat's Christmas"" instead."
5,A Delightful tale,Christmas for a Kitten is a story that has you living each adventure right along with the kitten. The writing and illustration come alive and bring warmth to this tale and transport the reader right into the story. The reader is taken on each adventure with the kitten. A perfect book to share the tradition of a Holiday read. Santa has a special Christmas in store for this kitten! This is a delightful book for both the young and young at heart reader.
5,"Beautifully illustrated, heartwarming tale","Robin Pulver's ""Christmas for a Kitten"" is a great book for those looking for holiday reading for and with their kids. It's a warm tale of an abandoned kitten fending for itself in the winter wilds until it hitches a ride in a car along with a Christmas tree, only to find a cat-chasing dog at its new home. Santa himself comes to the rescue, and newly christened ""Christmas Cookie"" makes the rounds with Santa on his sleigh. The kitten finds a new home with Santa himself. The story is sure to please youngsters, and the illustrations are exquisite--beautiful, realistic paintings that reflect true knowledge of cat behavior."
4,my favorite Christmas book of 2013,i found this at Dark Star Book Store and the lady that i was with bought it before me. so i had to order it from Amazon so that i could read it. charming. and the artwork is beautiful. i think this book has caused me to start collecting Childrens books of Cats and Christmas time. i keep looking for more. this art is worth buying more of.
1,Not dishwasher safe,Why bother with anything that needs to be hand washed? Corelle should be ashamed.
2,One fatal flaw,"Not diswasher safe, but then again, Corelle plates aren;t either, as their pattern also fades in a few years."
5,Great resource!,"This workbook is a great resource for the introduction of older elementary youth to the Catholic Church. Sadly, it is out of print and out of stock at the publisher.This book introduces youth to the basics of the Catholic faith. The old and New Testament, the sacraments,the ten commandments, Saints and the church year, etc...The book has the students look up Bible passages and answer questions or fill in a crossword puzzle to make sure they found the right passage and understood the content.Mary, Catholic prayers, Death and resurrection, parables are also covered.A wonderful book, no longer available.What good work you did Mary Cay Senger(author)."
2,Some good locations - many inaccurate descriptions,"I've completed many of the hikes in this book and in many cases have found the descriptions skimpy at best, and in many cases just plain inaccurate. The maps are weak and, like the descriptions in the book, look as if they were put together in 5 minutes. It looks like the author simply couldn't be bothered to spend the time to put together a quality product.The good part of the book, is that some nice locations are described that you might not learn about otherwise. Unfortunately there are a number of rather lousy hikes not worth doing mixed in (i.e. Bill Williams River - nice, if you like raw sewage maybe) & the author provides no way to differentiate between the two.Worth [the money]?? .... maybe, but it could have been so much better."
1,Slower than Molasses Going Uphill,"I've used McAfee software for years and, although recent version have had some problems, had no qualms about purchasing their Internet Security Suite 2007. BIG mistake!!! It took 4-1/2 hours to scan a 20GB hard drive! Very user unfriendly suite. Help file not very helpful. Web site is nos better. I'll keep looking through help and on the 'net to see if I can find out how to speed it up. The firewall initially blocked me from using Eudora, although I had granted it full access. I uninstalled a trial version of CA, and Norton Systems Works, to install this junk."
1,Latest Version is Bad Actor,"I bought a three your subscription with my Dell. It is a 2.0 GHz Pentium Mobile with 1 GB RAM. A few days ago the new security center wanted to upgrade, and I let it. Firefox has been very fickle since, and everything seems slower. The Internet is simply not there at times. I keep rebooting, and Firefox and sometimes IE just don't get back online. I don't seem to have ready access to any help. I don't seem to have ready access to help. I suppose I'll dig up a number or chat somewhere. Dell doesn't seem to have any obvious help.Bottom line, is I have been a very satisfied user (university and work) of McAfee for several years and a satisfied customer until this latest version. As others are saying, it seems to be a resource hog and general bad actor."
3,Beware!,"I have had multiple problems with this disk. After loading it, the program would send my computer into a restart cycle every time I tried to sign on to my ISP. After that problem was fixed via their internet chat site, the program rocked along for a few days then just quit running. McAfee does not offer free troubleshooting over the telephone, you have to ""pay per minute"" that you talk to a technician. Totally unacceptable! I sent the disk back to McAfee's Corporate Headquarters and I currently await their wit and wisdom as to the ""fix"" for the problem."
1,Another Mcfee bad product. - IT IS NO LONGER SUPPORTED,Mcfee no longer supports this product as usual for their products. So purchasing this is a complete waste of money
1,Mcafee is GARBAGE,"After trying Norton Anti Virus for a while and finding it buggy as hell, I thought I'd try Mcafee since in the 90's these used to be the 2 top companies for anti-virus software.STAY AWAY FROM MCAFEE. Buggy interfaces, slow performance, almost no support, bothersome pop-up's. For the high-end price you would expect something better. Not with Mcafee.Do yourself a favor and PLEASE, PLEASE stay away from any of their products. Try Kaspersky or Avast."
1,Computer-Jacked,"McAfee Security Suite has computer-jacked my computer! I totally hate this product and I've used McAfee for years. Terrible, terrible. When it is scanning or checking my computer, it slows everything else down to a snail's pace. Opening other websites or writing email is extremely frustrating when McAfee is doing its thing. Quite frequently, it knocks me off the internet. It's like someone else has taken control of my computer. I am going to get this nightmare off of my computer. I want my money back!"
1,They have got to be kidding!!,"I had McAfee ISS 2006 and loved it. I bought 2007 when my subscription expired. Oh my dear God!! What have I done!! The thing is complete crap. My computer is 1 year old with duel core chip and 2GB of memory. This thing never crashed. I loaded 2007 and it was crashing every 5 minutes!! I could not get on the internet with my browsers. McAfee was updating and Microsoft was reporting the serious errors with no problem, but forget about trying to get help from their website. They have got to be kidding!! I tried to uninstall it, forget about it. I was able to get enough of it off so that my computer is able to access the internet and not crash every 5 minutes. Thanks alot McAfee, you took a good product and turned it into crap and made a mess of my computer. I downloaded a free firewall and AVG anti virus."
3,Buyer Beware!,"If you buy this product simply because you think it will be free after rebate then think twice. A requirement to get the $30 competitive/upgrade rebate is the proof of purchase presumably located in the top inside flap of the box. Believe me, I have looked real hard and cannot find it in the box I have received. Mcafee has decided to include a two page user manual which only outlines the software installation procedure."
1,I should have read the reviews!,I purchased McAfee Internet Security Suite for 2 years in a row and had no problems. Hopefully I'll make it through the year so I can buy another brand when my subscription is up! It took me 2 hours to figure out that all 70 some items disappeared from my Outlook Express inbox because of bugs in McAfee. (It was a quick fix though.)
1,Don't risk it,I am a Comcast customer like some others here and downloaded this product as an upgrade to the McAfee I already had through them. BIG Mistake. I just hung up after being on the phone with their tech support for 1/2 hour trying to uninstall it. My computer had been badly messed up for several days before I came here and saw that I was not the only one suffering these problems. I realized that it was the McAfee program after reading the other reviews here. Trying to get assistance from them was quite painful too. What a mess!
4,ok,"The new version is ok. The security part of it is the downfall, it's difficult to figure out. I still can't get it to do what the older version did. My children can get on the internet whenever they want, even though I set times for them. And don't expect any rebate back from McAfee-as usual."
1,a poor choice for internet security,"I used to be a big fan of McAfee, but this latest version is a complete dud. It was very user unfriendly. It was impossible to figure out where and how to change settings. It identified another user identity on Windows as another computer on the network that didn't have McAfee installed. I couldn't access documents on the office website and couldn't figure out how to change the settings. The customer support is useless."
4,Betrayal,They promised mail in rebate for this product but when I have sent form printed from amazon.com along with the proof of purchase I have gotten note from McAfee that I do not have a proof that this is an upgrade and therefore no any rebate at all.This wasn't any kind of upgrade of any previous version. I was using Norton earlier.This much about honesty.Otherwise product by itself it's okay and I would recommend it.Thank you.
1,what happened to a good product?,"I have been a long-time subscriber to McAfee. I was willing to try the latest version, in that their user interface was supposedly improved, and numerous components combined. NOT TRUE. This is so murky. so impossible to use. I cannot get it to remove the SPAM indication from a reliable sender. When I try help, there is no listing for SPAM. The Email Rules are hard to find. I can't find a list of blocked addresses, so I can't unblock them.With great fear, I am about to suck it up, and try to unstall this mess.My wife's new Dell, came with Norton, which seems a lot simpler and strait forward.what happened to McAfee?"
1,another unhappy customer,"MaAfee security system made our computer inoperable.I had to email customer service from neighbor's computer. After seventeen emails back and forth with customer service we decided to uninstall since the problem could not be fixed. They would not refund our money for the second half of the year. Then when the year was up they charged our credit card for a second years service, I did not notice this charge, once I noticed they would not refund because it was past 30 days. I had to pay for 2 years of service and only received 6 months of headaches!!"
2,not the greatest release,"I am a fan of McAfee - HOWEVER the Program is very INVASIVE - if you don't want certain parts installed - the program bothers you that these parts are not installed with THREATENING LANGUAGE like ""you're not protected"". if you install those parts it slows your machine down - and i have a super fast chipset, motherboard and 2GB of ram - not my favorite release by far."
2,Rebate Offers always Void,"I bought my version of McAfee Internet Security Suite 2007 online through McAfee, after reading great reviews from the ""Experts"". Part of their scale was based on price, citing the [...] rebate. But this is the second time in a row that McAfee has found some reason why the rebate offer is void. So I paid [...].As far as the product, I would agree with other comments that it is invasive, it bogs down Internet Explorer, and some of the options are difficult to understand or modify."
1,McAfee is a pre-installed virus on my computer,I just bought a Toshiba laptop with this software pre-installed. Its uninstall utility does not work. It won't let me manually delete the files either. Isn't that a virus? I think what Toshiba and McAfee do should be illegal. If you are buying a computer with McAfee preinstalled I would recommend having the store remove it before you accept receipt or you'll be plagued with annoying popups from McAfee for the life of your computer.DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!
2,"Bogs down computer, no way to switch off security","This program is a huge resource hog. That alone has convinced me to find something else once this license is expired. Also, I can not find a switch to cut off protection temporarily for certain updates that it seems to be blocking (specifically, the IE update). If you are using a PC that is not connected wirelessly, be sure to custom install and do not load that feature onto your PC. There is no easy to take it back off other than uninstalling the whole program and starting over."
2,Too Many Problems With Installation,Unfortunately I could not get a workable installation of this software despite the fact I had McAfee Security Center previously. I ran out of patience and arranged with Amazon to return for refund.
1,Save your money and your sanity,"I have used McAfee for at least 5 years. This 2007 Suite is a piece of trash. I takes soooooo long to find a site that IF it eventually finds it you forget what you were looking for. At half the sites, if they are found, it will not allow me to progress into the site. In setting it up it insisted upon registering but never did tell me if the registration was completed; just kept blinking. I assume it was registered because it did update. I cannot get into half the sites I visit on a regular basis. It won't even find the McAfee site. Just sits there searching until it gives me a notice it can't find the site. Never will I buy another piece of software from McAfee. I should have read the reviews before I bought it but I had been satisfed with the previous version so I never bothered reading them. Dumb move on my part. Dumb one on yours if you buy it. Never again."
1,Please think twice before buying McAfee,"Buyer beware: this program will critically impair your system! Internet loading will be drastically crippled. Expect frequent system choppiness due to automatic downloading and background processes. There is NO WAY to close McAfee to get around these drawbacks other than to uninstall. I am going to return this first thing next week. I gave them a few weeks to improve performance with patches and upgrades, but nothing has changed. If only I had read the reviews ahead of time.Bottomline: if you don't mind these side-effects, by all means purchase this program; McAfee has solid protection. But there are easier ways to get that protection."
1,"Out of Control, poor interface, poor help resources","This maybe the worst interface I have ever had the displeasure of working with and that includes console applications with DOS interfaces. Edlin and fdisk are more user friendly than the McAfee's Security Center. There is noway to disable the software except by uninstalling the program or opening XP's admin tools and then forcing the services to stop, which is not a recommenable approach for the average user.Here is a short list of the probelms that I encountered. Counter Spy is cheaper, easier to use and has an interface that is user friendly!* cannot select to disable during non-internet use so I can run software that Security Center has conflicts with like ProTools 7.3 recording software.* the scan results are vague, ie returns 6 quarantined threats but doesn't display what the threats are and you can't print the result either.* There are more......There are some good features but the detractors win by a land slide."
1,You pay to have their advertising popup on your machine,"This program provides popup advertising for their latest version. I also found their spamkiller to slow down my email program too much so I turned it off. But I have to click a popup window confirming that everytime I start my computer. As other reviewers have said, this program takes control of your computer"
5,It Works Great For Vista!!!!!!!!!!,"I do not have a single complaint for McAfee software I like every since I used it. It scan, and found stuff that I thought was not on my computer... Thank It is worth the buy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,"Great Software, Easy to Use (for most humans)...",I have been using the prior version of McAfee I.S.S. with no problems; the latest version works even better. What surprised me is all the negative comments about this software - What are these computer users doing when they set this software up?? I have NEVER had a problem with McAfee software (using it since the early 90's). I can only recommend that purchasers of this software use a bit of common sense when installing. Configuring the firewall was almost effortless and the automatic updates run smoothly.I have a custom built rig and I love the way the virus scan runs without problems no matter what is running on my PC. I have used alot of different anti-virus software and McAfee is by far the best.
2,Not compatable yet with Windows Vista,"I can't give an honest evaluation because it won't work on my new computer with Windows Vista. McAfee, what are you waiting for!!!"
1,Disgusting,"Never have I been so unsatisfied with a piece of software. I installed it, and it worked fine for a couple of days. Then today it downloaded some update and told me to restart. I did. Now my computer doesn't work. First it wouldn't let me access the internet at all, it wouldn't let me access my programs, now as soon as I log in, my computer restarts every time, no matter which account I log in under. The only way I can get it to work is in safe mode. I tried to uninstall it, but that doesn't even work, even in safe mode. I'm stuck using my 4 year old laptop to get anything done. I only give McAfee 1 star because Amazon won't let me go any lower."
4,Love My TV Stand,"I had never assembled anything like this before but the instructions were user friendly. Also the manufacturer had a website you could go to to get help videos for the assembly. It was the perfect size for my standard 27"" TV. The materials seemed to be of good quality and the whole assembly took me about 3hrs. I am very satisfied with this purchase."
5,Rockin',"Paul Kariya truly rocks and this book proves it, too. This book is really cool and what is cooler is it's all about Paul Kariya, the greatest hockey player EVER!"
3,"Kariya, the Mighty Duck","Nice hardcover book describes the earlier years of NHL All-Star Paul Kariya's career. Some nice photos from University of Maine, Team Canada and others in b/w only. A must for any Paul Kariya fan."
5,Great Polisher!!,"This polisher is great. I used it to buff out the oxidation of my boat. It saved me hours upon hours compared to doing it by hand. I even tried to remove the oxidation with an orbital buffer, and no luck. This polisher has the power needed and all of the variable speed settings to get the job done. I am excited to try it out on the next project - my daily driver! I would recommend this to anyone looking for a great polisher."
3,its pretty good,"Its overall a pretty good buffer, well balanced and plenty of power. In my line of work though it is some what lacking. I prefer the dewalt and milwaukee because of their startup speed. I spend 5-6 hours a day with a buffer in my hand and with the makita, when you pull the trigger there is about a 1-2 second delay before the pad starts spinning. Doesn't sound like a lot but it takes up a considerable amount of time when you are starting and stopping the thing 100+ times a day. I need that instant hit when I pull the trigger so I will sick with the dewalt and milwaukee and use the makita as a back up. It is a good buffer though and would be great for someone just learning or the car nut who details his car on the weekends."
5,if you want the best,If your are looking for a great grinder this is the one. I have 9 others that I use but this one has them all beat. I polish stone (marble and granite)countertops and this machine worked all day. the speed adjustment and the way it starts up is just what you need. I highly recommend this item for the novice and the expert. well worth the investment.
5,Helped my buff,This thing is a buff buffer. It goes right through nasty crap. I used different pads than what came with it.
4,Makita 9227CX3 polisher,I purchased this polisher to replace an old Milwaukee polisher that still works well but is too heavy. The Makita was recommended to me by a friend that has a body shop.He used the Makita for years with only a minor issue with the speed control. The reason I bought it is the weight and reliabilty. I only buy quality tools - or tools that I find to be a good value for the money. So far I've used it a couple times and it works great. I would recommend it to anyone wanting a light weight dependable buffer/polisher.
3,Inacurate Picture,"I'd like to point out that although the photo of this item shows it comes with a foam polishing pad, it in fact does not include the foam pad."
2,powerfull....maybee too much,"the makita equipment are really good quality. unfortunatly, this sender is certainelly not a buffer and the padding simply suck. I have used several waxer in the pass and he padding seems to be the problem. It will be better with a cotton cloth, as per the other buffer, then a very thick kind of sheep coat. A would caution u in using this pafing as `i end up scratching my car paint. A softer cover such as again cotton or the new syntetick material would be by far superior. I guess a buffer is a buffer and a sander is a sender. do not pretend to be what u are not...."
4,Immensely helpful work to aid difficult doctrine,"Marshall is certainly prominent NT exegete, who here tackles that stickly doctrine of apostasy and perseverance.What he does in this book is such an excellent job of careful exegesis of all the interpretation alternatives, then shows why he feels the extremes of Calvinism rigid logic nor the casualness of Arminianism are true to all the Biblical material. Lutherans are classic for leaving these paradoxes in tact, however much they are troublesome to the human intelligence and rational.My only concern with this fine work is his distrust of anything to do with election. Other than this, this is a very fine work which interacts both exegetically and systematically with the topic. Would have been execptional if he had included other theological systems besides just Calvin/Arminius, and some more of historical tracings of this topic, however, he carves out his focus to not be these."
1,It could have been so much more,"Instead of being a serious DVD about the karting scene, this video is just poorly edited visual disruption with a blasting wanker-music sound track. It would have been so much better with the actual sounds of the karts as they maneuvered around the tracks, and a tripod-mounted panning camera. The ""Helmet-Cam shifter footage"" appears to be aimed about five feet in front of the kart missing much of the view ahead that is creating the action--very frustrating to watch. The only part of the video worth the viewing time is the ""Pre-Race Kart Setup"", but even that is elementary and seems to be included just to fluff up the disc's content. Hopefully, future volumes will be better."
4,A Century ...,"Even though I have taken college classes in African American History, when I saw this book and I had to pick it up. It gives a very quick run down of some (some) of the most famous and influencial African Americans, aka blacks, of the 20th century. I think that even a child would enjoy the pictures in the book."
1,Bad,The description states batter and battery charger but seller only ships batter. A major rip off.
2,For scholars of eschatology but not for me.,"I found this indepth study book difficult to read. However, students of historical eschatology would no doubt find it enlightening.I did find the title a little strange '...Theology for the Twenty-First Century'! Does Bible eschatology change from one century to the next? Only people change, God does not. Therefore, if eschatological doctrine changes it cannot possibly be from God, because He is contant from one generation to the next."
5,personalized,"great, a personalized apron...I loved it and the gift receiver loved it more..would buy another one."
2,water resistant at best,"I followed all the directions and put on a thick coat just to be sure. Only stands up to droplets. Also, came in a green can instead of What's pictured. Not sure if That's relevant."
1,Will destroy your boots,Mink oil is terrible for your boot's leather and really horrible to their stitching. Use Sno-Seal instead. Better water resistance and lets the leather breathe.
4,The Cutting Edge,The replacement blades fit the razor without any issue and the product performed as it was expected to.
2,Rough,"I was quite disappointed by this book, I was expecting something with more professional level content. It's all very amateur however, the artwork used in the examples is sub-professional at best.I was hoping that the book would deal with some of the specific Pre-Press issues relating to comics artwork, but the chapter there was frustratingly slight. You would be much better to buy a a more general pre-press book.The quality of the packaging and printing were also quite poor for a book that cost this much."
1,pile of sh**,"This sleeping bag was nearly useless. My dad and I went camping with some really light bags because the temperature was not even below 40(F). Those bags provided almost no warmth the first night. So, we went to big 5 and picked up two of these. They were incredibly spacious and felt durable. The zipper was strong. Overall, the bag seemed well made. However, the bag is definitely not rated correctly. It couldn't have been less than 40 degrees (F), but we still froze. The zipper lets in far too much air at the bottom of the bag by your feet which is what I feel made the bag work so poorly. We normally camp where it is much colder (Mammoth) so we definitely expected the bags to keep us warm in the local hills (Irvine), and they didn't. We took the bags back the next day. Horrible product."
3,Easily readable and well presented,Pictures are good and the lucid explanations for the seemingly difficult aspects of the subject are striking points of this book
4,Classic Card but with a let-down ending,"The book is classic Card. Tightly woven narrative with a brilliant reflection on human nature. Part of this book reminded me of reading stories from a great religious book. This book almost read as though it was written as a series of parables, with it's intent to expose the reader to the pitfalls and shortcomings, as well as the higher aspirations and ideals of the human spirit. My major complaint would be the ending, which seems to ignore the major concept of the book to provide a localized ""happy ending"". If you enjoy Card's other works, you should enjoy this book. It held my attention, and it made me contemplate issues that arose in the story, even when the book was nowhere in sight. If you can forgive the afore mentioned weak ending, this book is worth the read."
5,Manassas video,"If you're a Stills fan, you must get this. This video shows Stills at the top of his game. This live recording includes some great Stills/Manassas tunes and most of them played perfectly. It's a real live recording without the overdubbing fixes that many current-day ""live"" videos contain. You can see and hear how truly great this band was in its raw form. Get it."
2,There are better collections available,This is a nice collection of Gilbert and Sullivan work. I would advise however that the sound quality is very poor. I understand that this is an original recording but for the average listener interested in owning a general collection of Gilbert and Sullivan tunes (such as myself) there are better collections available.
1,Worthless!,"My rating is based on two criteria: (1) The authors can't write readable prose. They do not even know how to constuct a coherent paragraph, let alone build a coherent full-bodied narrative. Mostly academic jargon. (2) The authors say that you can view commercial real estate from many perspectives, but they emphasize financial economics. Unfortunately, anyone who restricts their view to fin econ cannot make sensible decisions.This perspective renders the book useless. It's clear the authors have no practical knowledge of commercial real estate -- or if they do they're keeping it a secret. Written primarily to impress their buddies in university econ and finance departments."
5,Very Pleased!!!,I am more than pleased with the quality of this product. My son loves Yu-Gi-Oh and was beyond happy to receive his card in mint condition!! I will most definitely order from this seller again in the future!! Thanks!!
3,"Not stellar, but nice","Bought this as a stocking stuffer for my wife. I wasn't super impressed with the brooch, but it is still a likable piece."
3,"Interesting, but inaccurate.","This book is interesting reading, but I wouldn't recommend it to people who are actually trying to learn about the religions which Bloom discusses. Mr. Bloom quite openly declares to be writing from the perspective of an intellectual unbelieving Jewish Gnostic, and his analysis of the various denominations is slanted accordingly.For example, he writes most favorably (and most lengthily) about the Mormons. Why? Evidently, because he believes that Mormonism has qabbalistic/gnostic roots. By contrast, the religion which he most unfavorably regards can safely be said to be the Jehovah's Witnesses. Why? Well, Bloom himself claims that the Deity of JW Church is ""remarkably like"" the much-hated demiurge of the ancient Gnostics (p. 160).Clearly then, we cannot regard Mr. Bloom to be an objective source of information in these matters, nor can his value judgments carry much weight for the majority of us. With these things in mind, read the book and have fun."
2,"You can trust academics some of the time, but not this one","After having read this book, and JESUS AND YAHWEH, and a review of Isaac Bashevis Singer, I conclude that Harold Bloom is a learned fool."
5,Nice,Very happy with this purchase - these are sturdy and easy to use. I would buy these again for my shipping needs.
3,better than its price indicates,"This is an inexpensive Chinese ribbon mic. If you're looking for a great mic for guitar amps, this one's stellar. If it busts, you can get another one. It's cheap. it's not a high end mic. It does sound good for many things though: abundant low end, and kinda darkish at the top. Can take a lot of high shelf eq without the sound cutting your scalp off. Great for any source that can be harsh or toppy. Cool for percussion too. I find little reason not to get one or two at this price. Just to make sure let me repeat, it's NOT a high end mic. Once you realize that, it's an awesome bargain."
3,I don't like the mic cord,"I just got the mic and have had little time to test it, but right off the bat I'd have to say that the mic cord being permanantly attached to the mic sucks big time. If the cord goes bad, what the hell am I supposed to do, this is a stupid thing from the engineers who put this together. Second the volume output is very very low so now I'm going to have to get preamp to bring up the level. I will report back after this, but if I were you I'd think twice about buying a mic with a radio shack cord hooked to it. sucks sucks sucks"
4,Epic Metal,"This is a very powerful, melodic, and epic-sounding metal release from these Finnish lads. Fast, precise drumming, good guitar work and black-metal type vocals (along with some clean vocals). A comparison to this band would be recent Borknagar. Quality stuff, if a bit repetitive at times. If you like Children of Bodom, Borknagar, etc., you will probably dig this."
1,Worst dvd I now own,"This looked interesting when Amazon sent it to me as a ""recommened"" video. This is the worst pile of poop I had ever seen. I am now little dumber for having watched this. Of no value whatsoever. Poor quality, no story or plot, and not even of artistic value. Looks like a project from an elemantary school class, jumbled & unprofessional. I would resell this dvd on Amazon, but I would feel bad to do this to another person. Thumbs down."
3,Kodak G-50,"I am very disappointed with this package. It jammed my printer (do not know if the cartridge was old), now I do not have a printer dock!"
1,"Since Printer is no longer manufactured , no use for Kodak G50.","I just lost 75: for the purchased of Kodak G50. vendor required to return such as was send in the original envelop, since I needed to open to see if such item was not broken like the one I received with the PrinterG600, also it did not came in the original box which was supposed to be, and dealer will not accept it unless was not open. I will not buy any thing that do not come directly from amazone, too much hassle."
1,obsolete!,"The G-50 WAS a lovely, practical gift from my children 3 years ago at Christmas. The following Christmas the paper and ink kit was no longer being carried by any big-box stores or local camera shops. I did find the kit on Amazon for about fifty bucks last year and now its one hundred, really. Don't invest in this type of printer-dock; the technology changes to quickly!"
5,Great Prints!,I love the prints that my G600 printer delivers. But notice that the paper and 'ink' supply is dwindling. So I may have to order another refill kit to keep me happy for another couple of years. Sad to see that Kodak is discontinuing this product line in favor for inkjet technology.
3,Really AMAZON.com??,"This cartridge prints very nice pictures, but it doesn't last long. Now I can't find the cartridge anywhere. Kodak doesn't even have them anymore. So now I am stuck with a printer dock that doesn't print!!AMAZON.com to the rescue!! But wait! What's the price??? $99.00 DOLLARS!! Are you kidding me???When it was available, I could buy it for $25.00 with a 100 pack of paper.For this price, I can go to Best Buy or WalMart and buy a new wireless Printer/Fax/Scanner/Copier on sale. I guess they call it Progress for a reason. Goodbye my Kodak EasyShare G600 Printer Dock. It was nice while it lasted (which wasn't long).I am VERY dissappointed that AMAZON.com would be so ridiculous on such an item!"
1,"Product is good, Kodak marketing stinks","The first camera I can remember was an Eastman Kodak and the only thing I remember about it was the pull-out bellows, the 90 degree view finder and the great pictures it produced. Kodak still produces a good camera, but like the gas companies, the tobacco industry and the cocaine dealers, once they have you hooked, they rip you off.Camera and printer dock still work fine, but Kodak has decided to stop producing the cartridges and paper and now whatever is available is three times as costly as originally. Even that would not be as distasteful as the fact that normal photo paper will not work with this printer. Way to go, Kodak. Another American icon down the drain."
2,Outrageous prices,I can't believe what a ripoff from Kodak. Bought this camera for my mom and it only printed 5 photos. So I looked up the cartidge and found it to be very expensive. People would pay $50 for 50 pictures. I can get them printed for less somewhere else. I mean before digital cameras I surely wasn't paying $50 for 50 pictures. Not even close!
5,GREAT PRODUCT!,"WHAT A GREAT STEAM CLEANER FOR THE PRICE! NOT ONLY DID IT CLEAN UP MY CARPET GREAT, BUT MY MOMS (WHO HAD NASTY PET STAINS). NOW OUR CARPET LOOKS BRAND NEW! IF YOU READ THE DIRECTIONS CARFULLY IT WONT LEAK OR BREAK!"
2,So so Rug cleaner,"I bought this to clean the carpet in my Basement which was a berberr carpet. First thing I read on the Manual is that it doesn't work well on Berberr carpets. Great! Tried using it te first few times and the front lip ket jamming on the carpet making it so annoying to use. Turns out that the front lip wasn't installed properly when I got the product. I installed it correctly and it worked somewhat okay since then.I bought it to replace a Dirt Devil carpet cleaner which the previous owners of the house I just bought, left with the house. The old Dirt Devil cleaner worked better than my Brand new Bissell powerlifter. I should have just returned the Bissell and used the Dirt Devil."
4,Awesome Price for O.K. Cleaner,"I really like the bissells so this cleaner is great for me. The $60.00 price tag and free shipping make it extra nice. I do prefer a dual tank system, but hey, for the price it's great. You need to make sure the water you use is as hot as you can get it because there's no heater for the tank, like you find on more expensive models, so doing a small area at a time is the way to go. Super happy with the price and so-so happy with the cleaner - it's a lower end model but it works!"
1,Waste of Money and Time,"This is not a very promising product, very disappointed with its perfomance. Have tried to use it 2-3 times and it does not clean anything. When in use, the suction comes from both hose and the base, it does not have any switch to toggle. Please do not waste money and time on this product."
4,T. Martin,"does not work great, but is OK for small rugs....this is a cheaper priced cleaner and as the saying goes, ""you get what you pay for"""
3,"Worked great, just not for long","We have 2 dogs, so we needed a machine that could handle heavy use. And though it worked well for the first few months, after that it went downhill pretty quick. It's been less than a year since we purchased it, and now it doesn't work at all.For $70 though, it did the job. I guess next time we purchase we'll get a better quality one with a warranty."
4,More comfortable than neck strap,Pros:1) More comfortable than neck strap2) Easy on/easy off3) Compatible clip with the Op/Tech wrist strap (also highly recommended)4) Camera doesn't sway as much as when on a neck strap5) Easily adjustableCons:1) Straps are a bit bulky in the bag and don't fold up as nicely as a neck strap2) Straps could be wider for even greater comfort3) Straps get in the way a bit when shooting portrait orientation - unclipping the right clip will help a bit4) Wish they had a quick clip directly to the camera rings instead of using the Uni-loops5) Looks a little funny (non-conventional)Some people might have trouble figuring out which way is up. It's pretty simple though... words go on the back and should be right side up!
3,Great Price Good Product,Product & concept is fine. Could be a little more sturdy to support SLR's or DSLR's. especially with anything but a standard lens. Elastic is a little light for such uses. Instructions on use and adjustments are limited.Would have liked a little more detail. It does what it is supposed to do and represents a good value for the money though.
4,Works pretty well with my camera,"I use this for my nikon d5100 camera.I like that I can walk around hands free.I gave it a 4 star simply because the straps do tend to twist and tangle up,but not too much of an issue."
5,It is just a terrific product and their customer support is the best.,"I love this little harness. I use a Sony A350 and the eyelets were very narrow. I did not think I was going to be able to use it, when I first got it. I talked with customer support and they gave me several options to correct the problem. I ended up using a couple of metal ""O"" rings on the camera eyelets, for the connectors. It works great and I'd definitely get the elastic version of the harness ($14)."
4,Good piece of gear for extended events,"As the sole photographer and videographer for a major burlesque troupe that plays large venues, I use long lenses for hours at a time. A standard neck strap just doesn't cut it when your lens and camera body together weigh 5 lbs.The Op/Tech strapping system works very well for my needs. It takes me a minute to figure out how to put it on every time I use it - but once it's on, my camera feels secure and my neck thanks me profusely by not screaming at me after a show.A good system for the event photographer who has to stand or run for hours at a time."
3,Camera harness,I was excited about a product that would take the pressure off my neck but soon realized that the harness does not stay in place and moves around. Then you end up with one side clip higher than the other. By the end of the day I could only sling it over one shoulder. There should be a way to clip it in place when you get it set for your body size.
2,Misread,"I don't know if i'm the only one to do this, but. I misread it maybe or it may not be clear enough. But this skirt is just the colored part. I was under the impression that the white part of the skirt in the picture was part of the skirt. It's not. All you get with these skirts is the flimsy see through colored material. Unless you already have something to go underneath, I wouldn't recommend getting this one."
5,Vision Bird Cage,I LOVE this cage. When I first was putting this cage together I could see why people said that the wire was flimsy. Once I put it together it seemed much more sturdy and I no longer had any concern. We have a canary and it seems to work perfectly for him. Cleaning the cage is a breeze. I love how the top comes off and you can clean the cage without stressing the bird out. I would highly recommend this product to anyone.
5,Vision Bird Cage Model M01-Medium/Love It,"I loved this cage enough, I purchased two of them. It keeps seeds at a minimum from escaping the cage onto the floor. I have one Lineolated Parakeet in each cage but they both could be comfortable in one cage if need be. Cleaning is easy. Just make sure your bird is somewhere on the cage and not on the bottom grate since the top easily comes off entirely to clean. To catch any droppings while cleaning the cage, I place the cage on top of a puppy wee-wee pad. With the pad underneath, I can also give them an occasional ""shower"" from a spray bottle at the same time. The food and water dishes on either end are easily accessible. They seem to like the perches too. Ergonomic for birds. Who new!"
4,great cage...,"Great cage... our finches are now really happy, it is clean, easy access to food containers. You do not get mess in the floor Anyway I love this cage. I will recomend this product 100%."
3,"bottom/grate hard to clean, should have a drawer!","this cage is nice in that it has the enclosed area on the bottom for catching debris;(only reason I gave it 3 stars instead of 2) BUT, to change the paper in the bottom, or clean the grate, you have to unhook the cage from the base and lift it (toys, bowls, possibly the bird too )and have someone else move it out of the way as you hold the cage in the air! who designed that? I'd like him to clean my cage! the perches that come with it are nice in that you can hook toys to them, but they are too thin. it isn't that easy to put together, but not the most difficult either. It is too small for anything bigger than a finch, eben then it is pushing it. Budgies (parakeets), parrotlets, canaries, and cockatiels need the largest one they make (which is this one but twice as tall). nothing more than a cockatiel can use the cages made by this company (Hagen), anything bigger would snap the bars."
3,"First Cage, Still looking","The cage is really great at keeping everything inside. However, the latches on the door are big and square in the middle of the front panel, it's hard to see my pretty bird! Also this one doesn't have a fast way to change out the paper used to collect waste. I never use the little food doors, but I don't have an escape artist to worry about. Seems like it was over-designed."
4,Works to keep bird stuff contained,"This is a versatile and easy to clean cage and a good size for a parakeet. If you think you might be happier removing the wire flooring, the food dishes wind up being too high for a bird to eat from without flying into them. The two cage doors on the side make a nice single opening but they do fall inwards if you miss the latch and don't make much of a ramp when folded out. But if you want to save a lot of time cleaning, this is the cage to buy: recommend getting some additional perches that are not plastic to make it somewhat less artificial."
1,SMALL! I did not get the extra height.,"Says it comes with four small four large to put together two sets of cages and stack them.It only came with one set. I still love the cage.VISION is amazing. I have a snake tank with them as well.Just a bit disapoited because in the picture and directions says its two high, it's not.At least mine wasn't"
2,Not high quality,The pad is made of newspaper quality paper. The lines are very dark blue. The 100 sheets is really too heavy for the cardboard backing and glued end. If you need to hang the pad on an easle good luck. I ordered 2 and on each one of the holes is cutting into the edge. I bought it to use in a classroom for students to draw concepts and post on the walls I don't know how much of the marker will go through because the paper is very thin.
5,Lowest price anywhere,"These tables are excellent quality. Perfect for my Kindergarten class. In this time of budget cut backs, I was glad to find such a great price. They arrived within a few days. I will buy them again."
3,Battery leaves a lot to be desired...,"I've had this phone for about 2 months now and so I feel qualified to give my opinion. I have not used the television features and so won't comment. Having said that, briefly:Pros:* Small* Easy to use* Nice-sized screenCons:* Battery life - absolutely terrible. I traded the phone in after 1 week because of it and the new U620 is exactly the same. I talk on my phone for no more than 15 minutes per day and do virtually nothing else with it except carry. If I don't charge it every single day then I can count on the fact that, after not charging it one day, I will wake up the next morning and it will be completely dead. I've checked everything - Bluetooth is off, navigation is off, etc. It's just a terrible battery I guess.Bottom line - if you don't mind charging your phone every single day then you will love this phone."
5,Better Than it Looks!,"Hey. I looked around forever for a good slider for verizon. I wanted something sleek and cool yet not a chocolate so I wouldn't seem like everyone else. The front face of the phone is shiny and looks new everytime you look at it. I've used it a lot and dropped it alot with no problems and it still looks brand new! I got mine on EBay and it still works great. The mobile TV is at great quality and if you love CBS FOX NBC or MTV or more then you're in luck and can watch TV no matter where you are! You need to buy a memory disk but it's worth it. I highly recommend this phone. Everything about it was made to perfection. Cool menu, easy to use features, mobile tv, take video without length limit, great design and has a bigger screen then a chocolate. Slides a lot better too!"
2,So cute.... but the battery is HORRIBLE!!,"I loved this phone for the first week. Great camera with different finishes (sepia, B&W;); great video camera; great TV quality (not that I'd normally use this, but it's free for the first month). All of this aside, this cell phone is not going to do you any good unless you carry a charger with you everywhere you go. This past week, I've had to charge it EVERY day, and haven't even used any of the added features besides sending a few text messages.I hate to part with this phone because I love the design, but it's not practical. I cannot keep charging it this often!"
1,It loses its memory,I had to return the phone to Verizon after several days use because it frequently failed to recognize the memory card on power up. Verizon told me that Samsung is working on a fix for the problem. I returned the phone.
3,Too complicated,"I was hoping for something more comprehensive than this. It's got all the characters and how to find them in the beginning in alphabetical order. Chronological order would've made more sense, cause I have to keep going back and forth and hoping I don't miss someone I want."
5,"Great guitarist,Great Book","This was a great read from start to finish, I always loved Roy's playing & heard some of the stories about him. I thought I would read this book & like it but was not prepared to be this blown away,the author Phil Carson knew Roy personally & just gives such insight into this unique man, who after reading this turned out to be nothing like I thought he would be. He basically lived to play his guitar & even though I get the feeling he loved his family I do not think he could have lived any other life. Not much more to say but you should read this book & listen to his music,a 1 of a kind person & a 1 of a kind guitar player. We all miss you Roy. Thanks Phil for writing such a great book!!!!!!!!1"
3,I LOVE THE MALLORYS,"I realy think its A must read DEREK was not as antagonizing, as his uncles but hes a Mallory and thiere for you have got to love him and the book but i can hardly wait for the story on Jeremy,and the Anderson brothers who I LOVE ALMOST AS MUCH AS THE MALLORYS,ALMOST!!"
3,Doesn't even compare to LOVE ME FOREVER!,"I was a little disappointed in this Lindsey novel. The first novel I read by Lindsey was LOVE ME FOREVER and I was looking forward to reading another of her romances, but SAY YOU LOVE ME just couldn't compare. I enjoyed it, but I never got that ""can't put it down"" feeling."
1,so badly written!,"Holey moley. Is this what a trashy romance is supposed to be like? I thought they were supposed to be at least somewhat believable, and not just an excuse for some soft porn. It's just so badly written.granted I don't read this type of book (I like Georgette Heyer books if I want a romance novel) but I thought it was at least supposed to be engaging in some fashion... you know, characters that you care about... what a waste of time."
2,"Not the best,,,,","That's only the third book I read by Lindsay and while I really enjoyed ""Love me forever"", this one didn't struck me as a particularly good romance and didn't hold my interest.The mentions about the characters appeared in the previous books are too many and boring. The story should have been more focused on the couple, and Kelsey's character wasn't well developed. Although some parts about Derek and his friends were funny, and the beginning very promising, ""Say you love me"" was a disappointment to me."
4,Loved it,"This is one of those novels that has you smiling even after you have finished and placed it back on your shelf. First of all, it is very realistic, especially historically. I cannot tell you have many historical romance novels I have read that is completely of sex. Not only that, but they make the female protagonists out to be strong, independent woman who are so unique against the rest of society that the man immediately falls for her because she is different.False!If either of these is in my historical romance, I immediately assume it is trash and donate it. I am unique heroines, in the right time that is. I like my history to be accurate thank you.Not only that, but I loved the humor. Despite villain and Kelsey's circumstance, it was a pretty lighthearted novel filled with laughter, an simple plotline that was easy to enjoy, and a great continuations of the novels that came before it.I cannot, however, give it a five due to the predictability of it."
4,the malory clan rocks!,"This was a great read. Not only did the hero nad heroine actually LIKE eachother and spending time together out of bed, but there was plenty of chemistry. My only complaint was that, not being an avid lindsey reader, I had a hard time keeping the family straight. There really needs to be a family tree diagram!!!!!"
2,hot cousin,"Here's a blast from the past for me. I used to really love this series. My tastes have changed somewhat over the years so I haven't re-read this for quite some time, but, if nothing else, I think this may have been one of the forerunners in series about a family (both the men and women eventually having their story told.)As I recall, Derek was the hot cousin with rough edge (James' illegitimate son) and all the best lines. I remember being so excited that his story had finally come out and so disappointed that it was so bad."
3,Re-read still like,"I re-read this book recently. I did enjoy it, its not one of my favorites amongst the Malory novels. But its still a good read. I wish that Johanna would have continue writing about the rest of the Malory clan (Marshall, Travis, Clare, Diane, etc). Even if she would have wrote how Edward and Charlotte(?) met would have been doable.Her last two books regarding the Anderson brothers were awful! I read 90% of her books and those sagas were just AWFUL!"
3,"A nice, but average, addition to the Malory series","One of the problems I had with this story is that we never knew or had insight to who Kelsey was. The author told us she and Derek got along and had chemistry but it was never illustrated to the reader. We knew Derek loved Kelsey but I had no idea why. Her personality did not shine through like Georgina's or Amy's or Reggie's. We got to know these women and had fun doing so. Kelsey came off as a tragic figure; a martyr, but she also lacked a spirit and love of life. Shoot, I didn't even know Kelsey's hair color into well into the book! C'mon Johanna, you need to play-up Kelsey in a future book to redeem yourself. ;)Derek was putty in her hands (for some reason) and his devotion to her was seen nicely in the book. Its about time another Malory hero had blonde hair, I though the gypsies took over them all! LOL!"
5,My introduction to the Malory clan,"""Say You Love Me"" was the first Malory novel I read, and it thoroughly captivated me. Derek and Kelsey are a wonderful, fascinating couple. The appearances by other Malorys intrigued me, even without the complete backstories, and I've since collected every other Malory novel. Yet even without having read the others, I was able to fall in love with Derek and cheer Kelsey along. I highly recommend this book!"
2,Say You Love Me,"I really like most of Lindseys books but this one did not ""grab you"" and take you away like all the others. I did NOT like this book, I think it kept referring to all the previouse books in the series of Malory stories. If you are an avid Lindsey fan you will have read all the previouse books and know what is going on. All the back referance really took away from Derek and Kelsey. Maybe in her next Malory book she will focus on the main characters instead of trying to fit all of them into one book! In short this book really lacked her usual style and pazazz! :("
3,Malory after all...,"I couldn't agree with the 5 star rate, but it was an entertaining book. Kelsey was sweet but naive, the villain was too hardcore and a little too much, I didn't like the hunchback at all. But Derek was great and there was Anthony to keep the interest going. It took JL a lot of imagination and it was hard to anticipate the next thing in the book."
1,A thorough disappointment,"As a reader of other Johanna Lindsey books (no Mallory's though) I was bored reading about a bunch of characters with limited or no roles in the story. Additionally, though the premise was interesting, the villain is so thoroughly distasteful that it interfered with the love story - which was lacking. I agree with another reviewer - the heroine needed some serious help, and the hero was not very defined. This book left me cold."
4,Good weekend reading,"The book starts off a little redundent, but after the story slowly unfolds, it was hard to put down. Kelsey is the perfect heroine. She's charming, witty, sweet, and innocent. Derek's character on the other hand is not as well developed. His feelings for Kelsey is not well expressed. I found the fact that he had to wait until the last chapter of the book to say that he loves her is ridiculous. The story of their romamce is not well developed in this book. Other than that, it's a good way to spend a relaxing and dateless weekend."
3,Say You'll Write Something Better,"This will be brief because I read this book ""out of order"" in the Malory series and am not as familiar with this author. While I liked Derek and Kelsey, there was minimal character development and I didn't feel like I knew them. There is limited understanding as to why Kelsey would sacrifice her honor and morals in such a way. Granted, she lucked out and was ""bought"" by a nice man who is pretty darned romantic, but I thought the whole scenario was contrived. There is too much superfluous interaction by dozens of other characters and they interupt the storyline."
3,Keep on loving the Malory's,"I liked this book because Derek was a good guy. I instantly liked him. I liked that he had a close family and good support system. Some people were turned off because he wasn't more of the Alpha male, but I thought it was rather attractive that he had a clan so to speak. I liked Kelsey but I felt that her story was a bit weak. A lady sold into prosititution to the highest bidder to save her sister from not getting a season or a good marriage match? Doesn't wash. It didn't really sit well with me especially since I really felt she could have been the ultra proud Scarlet O'hara type. Her aunt, her sister, and she could have all become seamstresses...etc. As for continuation of the Malory story..there isn't much continuation so you could take or leave this book in the series."
1,The Worst,I have read most of Johanna Lindsey's books. I was so disappointed with this one. I will have to agree with review number two. I couldn't say it any better. Except that I still can't believe how bad it was or that I finished reading it.
1,Blecch!,"I must not have been reading the same novel as some of you. Johanna Lindsey broke my heart with this book. She was my favorite author for YEARS. But as I kept reading, all I could think was, ""Sellout!"" Was there even a romance here? It was like one big epilogue... If you're a big fan of Johanna Lindsey, just reread one of her earlier novels. You can still stay in that happy bubble where everything is good, especially Johanna Lindsey's books."
4,What is the sequence?,I am listening to an abridged tape and am confused by all the characters mentioned from previous Mallory books. I would like to know the title and sequence of the Mallory series so I can start from the beginning. It would enhance the stories to know who belongs with whom and do any of the books contain a geneology chart? Maybe it is the abridgment that makes it confusing. Overall I am enjoying the stories.
3,Not up to Par,"I enjoyed this book insomuch as it didn't put me to sleep right away. I love the Malory series and Johanna Lindsey but this book lacked the spark the other's had. Kelsey was lacking spirit, although she was not as bad as Derek, who, while being a thoroughly attractive character is unfortunately always in comparison with Jeremy. Derek loses. I continue to hold my faith for the next Malory novel, however, and hope to see Jeremy very soon."
2,leaves much to be desire,"I was a bit dissapointed usually Johanna Lindsey books are very good but I found that it left much to be desired. It started off with a good interesthing idea that I've found to be quite unique, a younge woman autioning herself off to save her family, and luckly getting bought by a nice, handsome, rich, tittled younge man. But after that it sort of gets BORING. Everything you knew was just going to be alright when the main character gets kidnapped, this book didn't make me laugh or at least smile, nor did it make me cry, or hurrah it. I suggest that if your looking for a good read to not read this book."
2,Highly promising synopsis - but doesn't live up to it,"There are other J. Lindsey's I really cherish, but this one doesn't make it. To me the characters don't come to live, I just can't feel them. Between Derek and Kelsey everything goes too easy, he's so besotted by her, he just gives in to his new feelings. At least she's outspoken, that's the one aspect of the story I liked. If you read the Malory sequels, you might be interested to know that all of this great family still are dashing men and happy to be married to headstrong ladies. To me it was just a bunch of too-good-to-be-trues. And the end? The happy end is such a firework of unlikely coincidences, even a romance-addict like me can't take it."
3,He left The Monkees for this?,"Mike always had in my opinion, the best songs when he was with the Monkees. He was young, hungry, and ambitious. And then came his solo career. After several albums of country music that seemed far removed from the gloss, and hooks he had with the Monkees. He seem to run out of ideas. At the same time I got this CD, I bought Peter Torks solo album. What a difference! Peter has great lyrics, and rockin' music, and even good vocals! But when I play this album by Mike, it sounds like lounge vacation muzac with vocals, from a carribean cruise on the moon. Being wealthy, and older he really has nothing to say, and has forgotten how to rock. It may be clever, and be original, but it isn't great like Door Into Summer, Daily Nightly, Sweet Young Thing, or even Salesman. I'll take Justus over this strange bit of work anyday! Maybe you have to be young, and hungry, to be good!"
1,Distortion,"One of the greatest tenors of all time! I was so happy to find this collection available for download. I listened to clips on iTunes and heard distortion. I listened to clips on Amazon and didn't hear distortion, so I bought the album and downloaded it. Sadly, loud passages on these MP3s are also distorted. Truly a shame. I wonder if the original recordings are distorted, or if the CD is distorted, OR if it's just these lousy MP3s. I'm sorry to say I can't recommend purchasing this collection because of the distracting distortion. Very sad because these are marvelous songs sung by an amazing voice. Shame on whoever made these MP3's and shame on Amazon and iTunes for selling them in this condition."
3,Not worth the value,"Not the most easy to use product, as you have to exert force to get American chargers into the plug and the plug into the wall unit. Also, I originally thought it would be useful to have the various plugs as separate pieces, but this made for fussy carrying. Next time, I will buy a one-piece international plug set"
3,Adaptor Yes...Converter No...,"This is NOT a converter, just a bunch of adapters. That's why I purchased it, thinking that I didn't need something to convert the voltage. But it states clearly on the box that if the item I'm plugging in is not two way voltage ready not to use these. So if you are looking for adapters, this is the product for you, but if you need something to convert it, it's not. You'll have to buy a separate converter...which I had to do."
3,Not what I expected either,"As a review posted a few days ago stated, this was actually only an adapter set. I ordered it because it was listed as an adapter/converter set, and since there was very little descriptive information contained in the listing, I was expecting it to include a converter. At least amazon covers return postage..."
2,Cheap,"They worked but it always scares me to mix electricity with flimsy feeling, plastic devices.Also, it would have been nice to make it easier to identify which items went for each country. Placing a number on the item and them having that match back to the description seems like it would have been a relatively easy, inexpensive, consumer-friendly action."
2,Wont buy these,Functionally they are alright but I guess anyone will be better off buying a single multi-purpose charger.I wish they came in a case of sorts.
4,"Bad Start, Great Finish","I purchased these for my trip through Europe, because it looked like they'd cover everywhere I was going to be. The construction seems a bit cheap, and I was a bit worried when it didn't work at my first hostel in London, but otherwise I have no complaints. The various adapters ended up working in Edinburgh & Oban (Scotland), Dublin (Ireland), Paris (France), Munich (Germany), Rome & Venice (Italy), Athens & Rhodes (Greece), and then again at the other hostel I stayed at in London on my way out... I'm guessing it must have been a problem with the wiring/outlets at the first place. For the price and the geographical range it covers, this is a hard set to beat."
3,One problem with this for India?,"My only issue with this set: I see people saying it worked great for them in India, but India requires a plug with 3 prongs - if the ground prong is not present a safety feature will not allow power to the other two prongs. Yet, I do not see the appropriate plug in the set???? I'm leaving for India this week, and looks like I'll have to purchase something else."
4,Basic set,I'd probably opt for the all-in-one design I've seen but this worked well in a pinch. Used it extensively in Hong Kong and China with no problem. Note that the British three prong is not grounded and uses a plastic third prong.
5,Worked Great,Used these adapters when traveling in Ukraine and France recently and found them to be easy to plug-in and no damage was done to the electronics. These are the two concerns I had so I would suggest these adapters if you needed some at a reasonable price.
5,Works as advertised!,"These adapters worked well for charging cell phones, camera batteries, etc. Make sure your device that you're plugging in can be used in a 220V plug. My wife's cheap hairdryer that claimed it could handle 220V blew up. Keep in mind that these don't step down the current, they only change the shape of the plug. But like I said, it worked well on the cell phone chargers and the iPad charger. The adapters seam very durable.Happy traveling!"
1,Broken,"Took the UK plug in my carry-on bag, same interior pocket as cell phone. The cell phone survived without a scratch, but one of the prongs snapped off the plug somewhere between Dulles and London. Product is terrible. I will be seeking a refund."
4,"serves the purpose, reasonble quality","Pretty useful product. I have not used them much yet, but they look durable, even though they do not seem to be made with the best material."
2,Unclear advertisinf,"This product was labeled ""Adapter/Converter"" but appears to be only an adapter. I was seeking a dual-purpose thing, so it was disappointing."
1,Not a converter,"The fact that the product is called a ""converter"" led me to believe that it was a voltage converter. It is not. This is a deceptive marketing practice on the part of Lenmar. Don't be fooled. You will only get a set of adapters."
4,Good set,"We purchased these for our trip to Europe and they worked great. In London and Europe we used the skinny 2-pronged plug. The fat pronged plug didn't work. In London the 3-pronged plug also worked. Some outlets in England have the 3-prongs and some have the 2-prongs. Because most newer U.S. cords run on both 110 and up to 250 amps, we didn't have any need for converters. Check all of your plugs to see what they need. Our cell phones, laptop, camera, camcorder, I-pods, etc., all state on the plugs that they run on all currents. The only thing that didn't was my hairdryer. Instead of spending a ton of money on a converter I purchased a dual wattage travel hairdryer inexpensively, and took it with me. What I discovered was that the 220 volt current made the hair dryer run very fast, much more than it runs on our current. Most of the time I didn't need it anyway because the places we stayed at provided hair dryers.That said, I found these to be well-priced and worth the purchase."
5,Excellent Book,"I had hoped that Margot Dalton had written more than 4 books in the Jackie Kaminsky series but have been unable to find any. All I find is what I refer to as ""romance trash"" books that I can't believe she would stoop to writing. She is an excellent writer and all 4 books in this series are wonderful."
5,awsome,"this is working very well for me,there is no omg ive got to get to a bathroom lol, will use again and recomend to friends."
3,good detox,"I think I lost about 5 lbs in the 15 days that I used this cleanse. It was helpful in eliminating excess waste and not harsh to my system. When taken in conjunction with a reasonable diet and some exercise, I think it does assist in reduce bloating and accelerate weight loss."
3,It was okay,Before taking this product i felt extremely bloated and it halped with that but i feel like it could have worked a lot better.
1,Do not waste your money,"This product did not work for me . Did not clense or flush, please do not waste your money, time or hope on this Nature's secret for financial LOSS."
2,Didn't do much,"I bought this at my local GNC, and didn't really notice a difference with anything. I would take them exactly as directed. Didn't notice a thing. Don't waste your money."
1,Didn't do anything,"I bought this product hoping to cleanse my system before I started a new diet and exercise program to get rid of bloat, etc. I suffer from with IBS. It did absolutely nothing. Actually, it may have bound me up more!"
3,"Helps, a bit.","This product does help a bit as far as detox, but did not perform as well as I'd hoped for weight loss. I might buy again, not sure. Worth a try, though."
4,Good Flush,Good product ..Does what it says .... Felt good to be cleansing my body out.. Stomach was no longer bloated but...
1,do not buy this product,"It totally does not work, what a waste of money, and they charge me like [...] bucks to ship it it's a rip off"
3,15 day weight loss,well dont know bout others but me ive followed directions on the bottle read the paper and did everything and im still waiting to see something. ok price but i wouldnt buy it again because im getting no results.
1,Did not work for me,I bought this product at a local health food store instead of Amazon to save on the shipping. I weighed the same before and after the 15 days. It did nothing for me.
1,Dreadful product,"This product actually gave me the opposite of the desired result... despite drinking the recommended amount of water, this product made me constipated, I had violent and embarrassing gas and I had a really uncomfortable distended stomach until I stopped taking it after 3 days. As another reviewer said already, this went straight in the trash."
1,nothing,it did nothing for me didn't work i just didn't like it at all so no secret was in it for me
5,Very fun book,This was a great book. My boys became very interested in the presidents and they enjoyed it. We had fun looking at the pictures and figuring out what they were made of. Very creative! The only complaint is that it is not updated and the boys did wonder why Barack Obama was not listed in the back.
1,politically charged - inappropriate,"I love pictures by Hanoch Piven, but this book is a shame! He made a good start, giving short funny stories from presidents' lives. Nice to have a little human touch. But... then... suddenly Nixon turns out as a completely evil guy! And Carter is an angel!Shame on you, Hanoch Piven. Please stay with your pictures. And when you write something for little children, please keep your political biases to yourself... Just a shame!!Special thanks to Amazon for generous return policy."
4,Amusing and heartbreaking,"Closer to three-and-a-half stars. ""Zuckerman Unbound"" is a solid addition to Roth's oeuvre; the story of Nathan Zuckerman's meteoric rise to fame following publication of ""Carnovsky"" (a novel reminiscent of ""Portnoy's Complaint"") is amusing, especially if one considers it at least partly based on Roth's own literary notoriety. The novel is not as uniformly great as its predecessor, ""The Ghost Writer,"" yet it possesses a quiet charm all its own, alternately funny and heartbreaking. The novel's solemn (indeed, grim) ending illustrates the real-world impact of an author's vocation in fiction. There's much to enjoy about this book, whether or not one is a fan of Roth in general."
3,It came on tome,The book came on time so that is not the problem. I am happy with that. I just didn't like the book. It didn't give me the information I was looking for.
1,idle power too high,"With nothing plugged in, it drew way to much idle current (important in solar applications)"
2,"Informative & historical, but not very enjoyable to read.","I read the book because I had seen the miniseries on TV and was interested in more information. It included a lot of facts and was interesting from an historical perspective. However, I didn't think it was particularly well written from a literary perspective. It was also hard to follow because it jumped around. It included a lot of information that was interesting, but not directly related to the subject. Sometimes it seemed like it went off on tangents. Overall I would rate it average, it was informative, but not very enjoyable to read."
3,DD s life,"great overall bio, really gets to the nitty of DD s life.many unanswered questions , but great book coupled withThe last playboy"
4,Great read!,"If you enjoy history, especially military history, then you will enjoy this book. Written in much the same style as Byron Falwell's ""Armies of the Raj,"" this amazingly true yarn about a Quaker who becomes, if not a king, the Prince of Ghor will keep you wondering just what is going to happen next. I absolutely enjoyed the book. My only negative comment is that the later years of his life are glossed over rather quickly, but, that is understandable since the last years were no where near as exciting as the first 40. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys history or biographies. Enjoy."
4,Amazing Adventure Story,"Very interesting read, especially in the context of todays relations with Afghanistan. Macintyre always keeps your interest. He makes it compellingly easy to turn the next page. I enjoyed it, maybe you will too."
3,"Great story, a good book","The adventure of Josiah Harlan is an incredible story of ""The Man Who Would Be King."" Unfortunately, Harlan's story never made it into American history books. Yes, there is merit in some of the negative comments made in the reviews. However, for me, this was a fabulous read and I was captivated by the story. I read the book entirely on my lunch hours; one, two or three chapters at a time. It is too bad that his journals had not been preserved; we might have had a better view on his adventures in Europe and Russia."
1,Great movie but copy is terrible,"Looks like someone filmed what was on the screen. Don't waste your time, Amazon should be ashamed for showing this."
5,"Excellent quality, looks great too!","Love this ring, fantastic deal. don't worry about sizing as much because you can adjust it. I wear it as a pinky ring:) sterling silver...why get the cheap metal and spend more?"
5,Cool Snake Ring,"If you're looking for something related to Snake, and you want to put it on anytime,then, this is one of the best items.its' size is adjustable and looks better for both of men and women.I really liked it."
5,Great Value!,"I get so many compliments on this ring. I never take it off. It's carved details are perfect and it can easily be adjusted for those days when, as all of us women know, we retain fluids. I love the ring and Gem Avenue is my favorite place to shop for very reasonably priced sterling silver jewelry. I have already recommended it to others!"
2,So so,"I really expected more out of this book, it was a disappointment. If you have no idea about property management then this book is probably good. If you are already in the business, it's probably not all that helpful. I expected more details and this was an overview."
2,"Too Basic, No Meat","I was looking for a book that would help bridge the gap between real estate sales and apartment leasing/property management. This book was not it.It was full of too many broad generalizations and had no specific day to day instructional information. I guess I was expecting more of a text book style reference material than this general discussion of the industry.Show me leasing and accounting software examples. Discuss issues of maintenance and courses of action. Brainstorm on marketing property and filling leasing quotas. None of that here. Good thing it didn't cost much, cause it wasn't worth much."
3,Property Manager,Not a good book if you want real good info to become a Property Manager. More of a genralized overview of the job.
4,"Good, but if you're looking...","...for something deeper into this whole ""Tube Bar"" scene, look for a movie called ""RED"" which features Laurence Tierney who later went on to star in ""Resevior Dogs"" and in a few episodes of Seinfeld (as Elaine's dad). ""RED"" is made in black and white and is truly made up of still shots that are rapidly pieced together. Theses calls are played in the background, along with the occasional clatter of shot glasses and tumblers. Laurence Tierney is the perfect Red, and gives you a fantastic insight and background/history of these recordings. Indeed the reviewer below me is dead-on right - Moe Zisclack is ripped directly off by Red when he deals with Bart's prank calls.Get this and be entertained. Also look for ""RED"" the movie. I think it came out on the Film Threat label about 9 or 10 years ago. You'll love it once you see it. You'll love this disc too."
3,You yellow rat bastard!,"This CD features the legendary crank phone call tapes made to ""Red"", the owner of The Tube Bar. Some guys with nothing better to do would call up Red and ask him to page someone with a name like ""Al Coholic"" or ""Ben Dover"". As often as not, Red would fall for it, although he would often mispronounce the name they asked for. When Red didn't get fooled, he would go off on a profanity laced tirade on the caller. The callers actually come across as a bit cowardly, because Red would challenge them to meet him and fight, and they would never show up. The CD also features the same guys calling ""Tom"", an Italian grocer, and ""Judy"", a barmaid. These people would also go off on profane tirades against the callers. The crank callers aren't actually funny at all. The humor comes from hearing the obscene tirades that the angry victims go off on. Here is the track listing:1. Tube Bar - Red2. Red's Crapper3. Tom4. Interlude5. Judy6. Red Again"
1,"Disgusting, Unfunny","If you've never heard profane insults before, then maybe you'll laugh at this. If you require more thought & creativity to make you laugh, then this isn't for you. This is nasty and pointless."
1,"No ADO, are you kidding me?","you have to be kidding me. how do you have a book called ""unleashed"" and then not even go into any database usage? i dont think i have ever had to write an application that did not include some type of database usage, yet the author does not even cover it. nor does he go into forms in any detail except when it comes to web forms. where are the 2 pages it would have taken to detail how to populate a listBox? i bought this book off a sidewalk vendor for half price and i got ripped off."
5,A very interesting book to read,Reading flow of this book is very smooth. covers topics like threading in a very nice way. A difinite recommendation for anyone who want to learn VB.NET completely
2,Weakest of the series,"My guess is that Bird didn't live long enough to enter TV's golden period and be involved in the video performances that was burgeoning in Europe in the late 50s/mid-60s (i.e., the Jazz Icons box sets are wonderful archives of that period). As a result, this Masters of American Music DVD had to resort to still photography and multiple replays the few existent videos that had Bird's image on them.A barely adequate presentation, compared to the other programs in the series (Billie Holiday, Monk). The one ""live"" video performance of Bird (with Dizzy) was AWESOME but very brief!!! Again, too bad..."
5,Well Written without the Fancy Ruffles,"Before my sophomore year in high school I went through the beggining of this well written mathematics textbook. It was enough to clarify all the points on Algebra II, and cleared up any confusion from previous years. With a well structured answer to problems, a predictable pattern, and no smiling faces or unnecessary colors trying to make out that math was fun, the book focused on the basics neccessary to understand advanced math, which started me off way ahead of the game. I would reccommend this book to already imaginitive homeschoolers and such students who want the clear and consice knowlege without having to sort through large quanties of extraneous information."
3,Not for the intelligent high school student. Good for less than 10 years old.,"This book is good for learning an algorithm and applying it. Probably good for a smart youth of about 7 to learn math. Good for getting speed up for SAT exams for deficient students.Written for the mediocre and talentless, but a good exercise book."
4,Algebra 2: An Incremental Development,"The book didn't look pretty, but I know that is not going to be new. I'm satisfied with the purchase."
2,Free from saxon for good,"I teach at a very large high school, and this book and other of different levels were used extensively from the lowest level to the highest, which included math and physics. ours students improved from the lowest level, but never move beyond a certain level, mainly because the text are of very low level. Review, indeed they do. but what good is to review old material that is not challenging and does not offer enough of the material seen on standarized test and AP exams.we finally managed to removed this text from our school after much debate. our students are starting to show improvement using better books, and with it, better teaching."
5,Some of the Best Lake Wobegon monologues - all right here!,"The 4 cassettes are titled ""Summer"", ""Fall"", ""Winter"" and ""Spring"". All have very funny stories on them and are worth the listen many times over. But the absolute best of the 4 tapes, and the biggest reason anyone should buy this collection, is the ""Fall"" stories. ""Fall"" (which I also found listed separately, and have left a review there as well) contains the single funniest Lake Wobegon monologue, ""Bruno the Fishing Dog."" It also contains a funny take on Minnesota Thanksigivings, and a devastating 24-minute epic called The Royal Family, which I found to be well worth the trip.To me, Keillor-on-paper vs. Keillor-live is apples and oranges - they should be judged separately. If you do want to hear him, buy this collection--and the collection called ""Gospel Birds"", also a classic--and you'll be set for some time."
4,Honest description of used item.,"This item was advertised as used, yet it did not describe it as a well used library-audio-tape in a very beat-up cover. This would have been the correct way to do it. The quality of tape is good, as described."
4,Bunny Allen's Wheel of Life,"This was an excellent book. Bunny Allen was famous for being infamous. I've read this and his first 2 books as well, with this one taking the whole of the other two and then some. Stories about hunting, PH's, trackers, clients, fooling around and life in Kenya ARE what this book is about. Life in colonial Kenya was pretty wild, and we're not talking about the animals, and this book merely reflects a slice of that time. The saying used to go something like ""Are you married or are you from Kenya?""."
1,Honest review,"I most deffinitely DO NOt reccommend this book to anyone who is expecting to read a classic africana book. There is hardly any mention to actual hunting, guns or otherwise much else to do with Safari life. This book is simply a recolection of Mr. Allen`s advances with women while on Safari. Certainly, no gentleman would write anything like this. To me the book sometimes fell in the distaste of erotic novels!!!! DO NOT BUY IT."
1,Not as pictured!,"When I received this item it was some cheap knock-off that doesn't even look like the picture. First off the pad is smaller then the original xbox pad. Second the picture is blurry on it, and not as attractive. it has the same surface as the really cheap $5 pads, and the A and B buttons are actually Arrows. DDR doesn't even have those extra arrows!Overall the pad does work but I bought it for my boyfriend because these cheap ones go out too fast. Overall I am very disappointed."
4,fun for a kid who like to see how it works,Bought this for my 11 yr old nephew for christmas... he says he loved building it and seeing what he did wrong and being able to fix it.
3,nunchucks,good delivery and product intact and fine. slightly different from expected but still good
3,Meh...,"I got these to help in my control doing a four-point florentine. They halfway worked because they were too light, but with a little ingenuity I added some and got them to work."
5,Great product!,"These are Exactly what I was looking for.They are NOT intended to be a toy or super durable, but rather a training device.I highly recommend them for training."
3,OK - but will probably break,These are ok - but likely the string connecting the two pieces will come undone -- and the pins holding the rope will probably fall out. One set was not even assembled correctly. These are better than the first pair I bought.
1,Terrible book. May be a good intro to trading but thats it.,"This book is really a waste of money. The system it recommends simply doesn't work. The only good thing is that people will buy it and thats good for day traders as the more suckers come in to the game, the more profits to be made by the experienced traders."
1,WORTHLESS,"I HAVE BEEN TRADING FOR 22 YEARS, AND WAS GIVEN THIS BOOK BY MY SON. IT IS RIDDLED WITH ERRORS, AND MUCH OF WHAT THE AUTHOR SAYS IS COMPLETELY INCORRECT.IF YOU BUY THIS BOOK AND FOLLOW THE STRATEGIES WITHIN, YOU WILL NO DOUBT LOSE MONEY!"
2,Good book for beginners,Hi everyone. Is there anyone out there from the New York City area who is willing to buy the Omega Tradestation and split the cost?Or maybe someone who already has it and is willing to let me copy it for a small fee?thanks
1,Mr.Farrell seems to truly feel our pain.,"He tells unhappy nine-to-fivers what they want to hear most. He shows an amazing artistry in painting the ideal picture of life, so he is no doubt going to be forgiven by many for ignoring the facts and the truth. What puzzles me most, however, is the reason why he has not yet joined Bill Clinton's PR machine at the White House. He could have a far more brilliant career there than ""prospecting for gold in the land of 1/16s""."
4,"If you are relatively new to trading, this book is for you",The author describes a relatively simple system for day trading non-Nasdaq stocks. I have just read it and so far have been on the winning side. This book is great if you do not like technical reading. Would have been 5 stars but sometimes can get redundant.
4,Exciting Book On The Topic of Online Daytrading,"I have read Mr. Farrell's book three times through. It has given me a very good understanding of day trading online. Since then, I have made a few trades and they have been profitable. I plan on continuing my day trading experimentation.A few criticisms: The book appeared to be hurried into print. There are a few mistakes that could have been corrected. Also, I would have liked to seen more ""what to do if"" scenarios, because they DO present themselves and they are not covered in the book. Chris, if you're reading this, e-mail me because I have some questions :-)."
5,Excellent informative guide,I was very impressed with this slim volume. It is concise and well written and very easy to understand. It is the kind of book which you read and immediately want to go and try the things suggested therein. While not a comprehensive guide I think this is one of the better books in the field.
1,Can I give the book negative stars?,"This book is terrible. The systems presented in this book are 10 years out-dated, yet it is still being marketed as if it were 1998. The strategy presented is useless given the changes, and the book should be pulled off the shelves.Amazon, Borders, Barnes, etc. apparently figure the big neon green lettering will fool their customers. They all should be ashamed of themselves, or at least ashamed of their complicity in marketing this book. If you bought this book, return it and complain. ... oh yeah, and if you buy another book on trading, check the copyright dates.Is anyone actually surprised that they can't find Farrell nowadays? I didn't think so."
2,The definition of monotonous.,"This book could have probably been published in under 25 pages. Yet he repeats himself 3 times for each point he makes, he stretches it to 231 pages. Keep in mind that the strategies discussed have no relevence in today's markets (2003). I highly doubt they would work even in the boom market of the late 90's. He does not even mention the downside risk if a trade goes against you. Risking $50,000 -$200,000 to try and make $125 all while paying $10 in commissions is the quickest way to the poorhouse. And it is laughable for him to suggest that you stand a chance trading though online brokers like Etrade & Ameritrade."
3,Quick Review,"Quite repetivive but informatative. Won't be using this as a guide to quitting my job and trading stocks for a living, but did pick up some good insight in how ""the market"" works."
4,"A ""must read"" for the novice day trader.","Chris Farrell dissects the Specialist system of the NYSE like no other book on the market. He drives home concepts, like ""scalping teenies"", with clear, concise and intelligent examples. Many of the day trading books on the market today push the volatile ""tech"" stocks as the best way to make money. Chris' emphasis on ""hitting singles"" off low volatility stocks is far more appealing, and prudent, for the novice trader. Trading for miniscule profits like sixteenths and eighths may not seem like a way to make a living, but Wall St. has been doing it for decades. Eight years ago this type of trading was not available to the public. Only with the advent of the internet has the day trader emerged and Wall Street's ""teenies"" must now be shared with this new breed of investor. I highly recommend ""Day Trade Online"" to anyone considering day trading.---How can I get more information on the ""Farrell Preferred Stock Arbitrage Fund""?---"
4,Make Money by Betting With The House,"There are 2 techniques explained in the book. The first 176 pages (10 chapters) explains in a lot of detail the conservative technique the author uses to make profits a bit at a time by betting with the house and day trading like the specialist. The rest of the book is about momentum trading. Don't let the author's age fool you. He's only 25, but he's traded more than 15 million shares. That kind of REAL WORLD experience is worth reading. I rate this more than 4 stars, but not quite 5 stars."
2,Good for knowing how the market works,I give it 2 stars according to the subject of day trading. But for how the market works it should take 5 stars. He talks too much about the specialites and market maker.He has alot of repeated sentences.He wrote about the psychology of being trading alone and his memories.His idea of buying in the bid and selling in the ask in NYSE can be understood from the beignning of the book.He has too littel explaining in the momentum trading But he talked about the market maker in the Nasdaq and how they affect the momentumIf you are looking for a book about day trader try something else but if you are looking for how the market work this is it.
1,An Idea Whose Time Has Come and Gone,"Regardless of what you think of the ""trading for teenies"" method espoused here (and opinions vary widely among those who've tried - see the earlier reviews), the NYSE is making this method impractical in mid-2000. They are dropping fractions and going to decimal dollars-and-cents pricing with minimum spreads of $0.01. If it's a challenge to make serious money trading 2000 shares at a pop in a slow-moving stock, how much harder will it be trading 10,000 - 12,000 shares at a time? And that's assuming your online broker will even accept an order that big.By the way, Wiley and sons should be embarrassed that they let this book out the door. I've never read anything that so badly needed attention from a competent editor. The amount of repetition makes it a real chore to read; it could be about 80% shorter with no loss of content."
5,great book - concentrates on NYSE more than NASDAQ,"My husband and I were one of the first people to buy this book back in April - I think that the strength of the book is in how it details the trading psychology of the specialists (New York Stock Exchange) and the market makers (NASDAQ) and how the daytrader must mimic their precise moves if he/her is to be successful - I look foward to his next book -I also like ""Secrets"" by Friedfertig and West -"
1,GUARANTEED STRATEGY FOR FAILURE!,"I read the book cover to cover and can't remember the authortalking about partial fills one time. Buying 2,000 shares of a stockthat trades 20,000 shares a day with the goal of making a teenie ($125.00)? Give me a break! He should be ashamed. He will make a lot more from this book than he will ever make using this strategy. The only good part of the book was when he explained how he lost $12,000.00 in 24 hours."
2,These strategies will drive you to the poor house.,The strategies in this book WILL NOT WORK. Trust me I tried and lost with them. The stocks that he tells you to buy trade at such a low volume that you can't possibly get in and out of a stock quick enough to make a difference. You will get caught waiting hours to execute a trade and that is not what day trading is about. Finally trading 10 to 20 thousand dollars at a time to make one hundred is a policy for disaster.
3,"Some New Insights, Not Rocket Science","Big picture: for the price of a round trip commission, his book reinforced the value of buying on the bid and selling on the ask...that's worth the price of the book I suppose. And, some new insights into ""How to Scalp NYSE Stocks"" that isnt available in the other books I've read (which is most of them).The book is carefully written, and does provide some benefit. I believe that it's worth the price of a rt commission to save money by at least buying/selling inside the spread. He has some good trading tips and psychology thats worth reading. Taken with all the other books, this one provides one more insight, which I found worthwhile. So, give it a try."
2,"Book has useful info, but...","I have been trading for a year now, and still being new, I am always looking for new ideas. Farrell's book gave me insight into how markets work. However, his system, in my humble opinion, has it's drawbacks. The ""specialists"" have the upper hand in ALL matters of knowing which orders are coming in and after using his system (albeit with a minimum of cash), I find the risk to be just as great, if not sometimes greater. Overall, I feel that Farrell's system can not be exploited to its potential by the average day-trader, although I like the premise behind his strategy to ""hit singles, not home runs."" But, then, what do I know? This guy is two years younger than I am, and he's 1000x as rich!"
1,Waste of time and money,"Another Wiley & Sons stupid book I bought... Silly me.The editorial line of this publisher is really to be questionned, to say the very least.Reading the book, you will wait for the meat until the very last page and not find it.Long and imprecise explanation about the way the market works."
2,Critics: say something intelligent!,"Would the critics of this book stop trying to be the Howard Stern of day trading and start using their brain cells? If these techniques don't work, I and a lot of other people are really interested in a rational explanation of *why* they don't work."
2,"Good introduction to trading, but repeats too much","This book helped me ""get a feel"" for the market, but that is about it. The strategies may work, I haven't tried yet. You must know, though, that the book would be 100 pages if all the repetition was removed. I feel that the book was stretched to 200 + pages to make more sales, not because of content."
1,An extermely overpriced book!,"After I had done with this book, just realized ... there're many familiar facts/infos can be found on other similar trading books. The only thing I can conclude is ... The author just too inexperience in volatile trading world not to say publishing a book to teach others... (trying to cover his lost in stocks?) as we can see... he himself can't even control and handle his emotion on down days... see page 224 ""I find that when I hold a volatile stock overnight... trouble sleeping. I toss and turn all night worrying...."" see page223""irrational thoughts were entering my head. I was angry. My brother was in the room and I was even mad at him...""Well, all these just happened few months before the book was published. How many novice investers had incurred a lost in stock market after reading this book? I wonder... My advice, son .... learn how to drive safely before you start teaching others! from A stock market veteran"
4,Great insights on seeing the Wall Street side of the trade,"The thing I liked most about this book is that it presents ""the other side"" of trading, namely how the Wall Street brokerage firms and specialist profit by trading against their customers. Farrell's message is that, as a profitable daytrader, you must do the same thing to Wall Street that they do to the investing public; in other words, making ""the spread"" instead of paying it. I see things in a different way after reading this book. A very good read."
2,"Nice to read for beginners, but...","... there is a lot I don't understand. The book focus on day trading, however no word about the new ways of realtime trading. I think, the author wrote the book some years ago and forgot to update on some chapters very important for the day trader. OTH, for a beginner there is lots of good information about how the exchanges work."
2,"Old ideas, Tough to implement profitably","The author makes day-trading sound like it's child's play. However, the truth is far from that. The trading method he ""teaches"" makes you compete directly with AMEX/NYSE specialists. It is foolish to think that you can compete with specialists, who are in essence the BEST TRADERS IN THE WORLD!! As stated in previous reviews, Farell's method involves trading in very illiquid stocks, meaning that it may be very tough to buy or sell in quatities that you want to when you want to. It is very likely that you end up holdingp positions overnight because nobody wanted to buy at your price. I will stick with short term support and resistance trading until I find a better method. Hit and Run trading is a mcuh better book on day traidng. Good luck!"
3,"Good book for newcomers, with one warning..","While the temptation is to run out and start cranking out 1/16ths profits (which has its drawbacks as noted in earlier reviews).. I still would recommend this book to anyone new to the idea of online trading simply for the fact that the repetitive explanation of how the markets are organized and some of their dynamics are given a good tour. While the book focus exclusively on 'day-trading', one can take an understanding of the market from this book and move onward to either short-term investing or long-term investing, online with a discount broker, and feel a bit more comfortable in the waters. As for day-trading.. I'd say move into that when you've got some cash to lose while you perfect your strategy in 'shark infested waters'. ~EnricoSuave"
2,Some possibly good ideas,"If you've traded before and already understand limit orders and bid/ask sizes, you can skip the first 125 pages. In the remaining 100 pages, there are good discussions of the motivations of specialists and how to work with or around them. There are three possibly useful ideas that are explained with only partial descriptions of potential problems and issues.The main idea of trading for a 1/16 point gain may work most of the time, but since the typical loss is likely to be 1/8 to 1/4 point, it needs to work over 80% of the time to be successful. Once this stragegy is widely used, it's success rate will go down. One suspects the author decided he could make more money writing this book than by continuing to pursue this purportedly successful strategy (no data on past success rates is presented)."
1,Don't Bring Your Guns to Town Son; Leave Your Guns at Home..,"Didn't see anything that excited me here. Book too way off the trail. I'll give you a free tip.... All you have to know about trading is support and resistance. Buy low, sell high. Trade only one stock - Compaq. That's all there is to it! You too can make a lot of money and be driving a nice new shiney Jaguar like me! Don't waste your money on these foolish books. Just remember two words: Support; Resistance."
2,Life isn't easy. That includes a well written book,"I lost count of the use of the same expression. I stopped at about 30. I think the whole book writing process could be improved if the editors would actually read what they put out. The idea of saying the same thing over and over again coupled with refering to his ""vast experience"" of TWO years gets a little thin. I must give him credit on drilling in the idea of the market makers and others that work on the floor. This work could have been reduces in size to about 100 pages and we could have saved a few trees. I gave him 2 stars because I found 1 idea. For that reason alone I would read the book again. One good idea is all you can expect sometimes."
2,"4/5 a rip-off, 1/5 good reading","Have you ever heard about those ""luck chains"" (at least it is called so where I live) - I'm talking about the prospect of paying a 100$ to someone to become a part of the luck chain, and then you have to find 3 people that will give you 100$ and so on and so on. Well, think for a moment what would happen if everybody did what Christopher suggest in his book... how in the world would anyone be able to make a profit when each single second probably every available stock would be monitored by other day-traders?The other part about volatile stock trading is OK, but there are other much more elaborate books about that topic.To sum up: this book has an expiry date. When enough people read it and start doing what it states, those methods become useless. That is my opinion."
5,"nice book, but i need advice","I read the book recently and find it very good, but after reading some of the negative reviews i was disapointed. Can somebody who have actually made money this way or the author e-mail me. It all seemed so easy before i read the reviews, but now i'm not so sure. Please, somebody give me an advice."
3,A good intro for the novice; wordy,"Chris' book is well intentioned, but wordy. The repetitiveness is probably a benefit to the novice, but the detail can become somewhat excruciating.The book's content dealing with the bid-ask spread and the method Chris uses to exploit it could easily be explained in two pages.Note: It can be interesting (for a little while) to watch the slow-moving stocks mentioned in this book in real-time because it is a reflection of the market in slow motion."
3,"Interesting, BUT...","I found this book to be a good introduction to the mechanics of trading, so it's worth the price for that, at least. If Mr. Farrell is correct in claiming that all NYSE orders are filled on a first-come, first-served basis, AND that customers' orders get priority over the specialists', then his approach is okay in principle. However, I have looked at several intraday volume charts from some stocks in his list that I chose at random. It seems that most of them do not trade in lots of 2,000 or more shares any more often than 2 or 3 times a day. Therefore, partial fills seem almost certain. Would Mr. Farrell, or anyone praising his approach, care to describe how they handle this situation and still crank out 4 or more teenies per day?"
3,"This is A book, not THE book","Major downers: need a lot of capital to be successful in teenies. otherwise, you will sit there all day and vegetate. Next, it is impossible to shy away from nasdaq and focus only on NYSE. Third, what do you do with volitility when you are not 100% sure anymore. do you or do you not take a risk? He doesnt address a downward or horizontal market.+ side: He teaches some clever psycho-emotional disciplines. he teaches how to minimize a loss, and other handy insider tips, which are available only from an experienced pro."
1,Poorly written.....Don't quit your day job yet.,For one if we all started utilizing this technique we would be competing against eachother for the golden 16ths this book advocates are just waiting to be had making it virtually impossible to do. (And you thought those docile sleepy mkt makers of the ever unaffected reits and utility stocks would be the only wrenches in the works.) And second; why would an author write a book creating tremendous competition for himself at what he does for a living. Writing a book about grabbing these 16ths from professional mkt makers who closely guard and watch their spreads would be the last thing he would want to broadcast to the world especially if he is making the 300k/year he claims to be making with his method. (I seriously doubt this poorly written book will bring in THAT much for him by comparison.) Proceed with great CAUTION. The stock mkt is a barracuda industry with NO mercy. Be smart.
3,What's with the negative hype?,"How is it that so many of your are so negative in your review? I could care less if the book makes me laugh, or is any work of art. I only care if it works, and I make money. Yes it is repetitive, but that's because the info is important. Having daytraded for over a year now, using several techniques, including high speed execution systems, I prefer Farrell's techniques. If anyone really knows a better system or has a reason why they think his technique doesn't work, I'd like to know. I've been trading 2000 share blocks for 3 months now and I easy pay for the cost of the book every time I trade. Could it be that most people don't have the capital to trade profitably or just don't want anyone to know how powerful his techniques are?"
2,A few Tidbits and nothing more than repitition,"Criticizing an author is a bit embarrassing but I have to admit that this opinion is only to guide others. Firstly, this book is for those intending to trade on NYSE. Chris (25) does explain to you how to look at the bid-ask spread and also what is invisible to the eye and mind when one trades online which was interesting. I have done quite a few trades using an online broker but admittedly not NASDAQ Level II.Outside of a few tips here and there, this book has nothing much to offer for those with some knowledge of trading. Most of the statements are repeated over and over again and much of what is written just does not carry over in a professional manner to sink in. My advice : Go get it from a library if its available there. I was a bit disappointed."
3,Great Information Source on Markets - Strategy Doesn't Work,"I'm a small-time Day-Trader that's made over 200% return this year using a strategy that others say can't work. I tried this authors strategy and for me it doesn't work. Good in theory, impossible in practice. I think that this book though is the best book so far in explaining the big-picture objectives and strategies of day-trading, and gives the best introduction to understanding how markets operate. A must read for beginners who don't know diddly about markets, but don't count on his technique making you rich."
1,Is it ethical to sell this book,"This book was written in 2000 from events occuring in 1998!!! Totally out of date! Useless!! Wondering why it is still for sale. The author, contacted by email responded but did not address the questions asked, simply giving excuses and mentioning that he wrote another book much better than this one... Outrageaous! Spread the word and if you own the book, get your money back!"
2,Not Very Helpful Book,This book is based on the authors opinions instead of a book that gives crucial innformation. No technical analysis help and barely any fundamental help. Horrible book
1,I definitely do not reccomend this book.,"I challenge the author to show his records of the trades he made using his system. I would be amazed if he could verify that he made tens of thousands of dollars per month. I tried his system, and have found that you can make small money in the shortrun when your stock gains 1/16th of a point, but in the long run you will very easily lose your profits when your stock goes down 1/4 to a 1/2 a point or more, and this can happen very easily. With total commissions of $20 to buy & sell, on nine trades you would make $105 times nine for a profit of $945 buying 2000 shares of stock and selling for a 1/16th of a point profit, but if your stock goes 1/2 point downward one time, you would lose about $1145 for a total net loss on ten plays of $200. On real conservative stocks there were very few if any plays available. I would like to see authors like him questioned by the legal authorities, and made accountable if they have not been truthful."
1,This book is a joke,"The book is flawed and in no way represents day trading. I only hope that no one takes it seriously. The authour contradicts himself throughout the book and gives strategy advice that can be disasterous. Wish I had saved the money and just threw it in the trash can, or better yet taken it to a casino."
1,Don't Be Fooled-This Won't Work,I've been day trading for 3 years.Take it from me all this method will get you is deep in the hole. It just won't work.
1,Can't Possibly Work!,"Like so many authors before him, it just doesn't work. Can't get off the trades due to low liquidity of the type of stocks he says he uses. ""Those that can do -- DO! Those who can't Write about it!"" Bet you can't do what you say in today's markets. Take me up? I need the bet to get even after trying your lame system."
4,Thank you Mr. Farrell!,"Well, after reading through all of the naysayers to this book, I figured I had to add in my $0.02. I read the book and have trying out the technique for 5 trading days now and have nearly a 50% return. Since I'm a full time student working on two graduate degrees, I don't have much trading capital nor time, but I've been getting this technique to work wonderfully -- you just have to have patience and can't expect to make $10,000 a day. If that's what you want, good luck and try to keep your shirt."
2,help me I have fallen and I can't Get up!!!!,"This book is had way to me fractions for me!But 1/8 this, Buy 1/9 this, sell 5/10 thatWHO IS THE AUTHOR TRYING TO ATTRACT AS READERS!Also the author tells you not to do home work, Sorry people but even a day trader should now whats going on in the market. You invest time knowing your trade (profession) and no matter if I choose to be a day trader or long term investor, I believe you must know your profession and how it works.I do not recommend this book to beginners or mild investors wanting to day trade. This book is for someone???? Well I am sure it is for someone, just not me. AND I DO MAKE MONEY DAY TRADING!"
4,Motivational,"After reading the book, I was so motivated to go and make money. However when I went to trade I discovered that the spread is so thin ! A cent for that matter. Has the rules changed or am I doing something wrong?"
3,"missing some obvious songs for a ""greatest hits""","it is cliche to say that there are missing songs on a greatest hits CD - but in this case it is a big deal. while this CD has ""Use Me"", ""Lean on Me"" and ""Ain't no Sunshine"" it is missing ""Just the Two of Us"". That is one of his best songs, one of the best songs ever. No musical reason to leave this one off. Must have been a record company money thing. Get one of his other greatest hits CDs."
2,Do NOT buy the Wii version!,"I really wanted to love this game. The controls are awesome...when they work.The instant pass after hiking the ball is just stupid. Yes, you can prevent that from happening, but you shouldn't have to think about how to snap the ball in order to not throw an instant incomplete pass. It's really great to explain to your friends how to carefully handle the controls in order to prevent a lost play...The graphics are awful. Feels like one of the early PS2 versions.The game play can be really fun, but I finally gave up on it because the glitches are too frustrating. Maybe EA will figure out how to design for the Wii by next year."
3,The new interaction,"I just started playing this game and its alot of fun. I like it because you can actually pretend that you are throwing, swatting and tackling your opponent with the wii controller than you would with a regular controller. The problem with this is that sometimes when you pass the ball, it dont necessarily always go to the person that you want it to go to and it takes some getting use to with the wii controller than any other controller."
2,Controls need some work,"I want to start by saying that the game itself is pretty good, and the Wii-exclusive features (2v2, telestrator, etc) are a definite bonus.That said, the controls for the Wii are a let down. I have been an avid Madden fan since 1999, and every year, the controls get slightly more complex, but they build upon the previous year's controls. While Madden 08 for Wii has all the new control features, the controls themselves are complex and difficult to learn , and I feel they really take away from the game.All in all, Madden 08 is a great game , but get it for 360, not Wii. In the future I am hoping to see support for different types of controllers, perhaps GameCube. If we're really lucky, maybe Wii will introduce a modern controller to compliment the classic controller."
5,Madden '08 Rocks,This game is worth every penny and delivers more than it advertises. My husband I were both surprised by it when my son played it!! Would definitely recommend to anyone into football or gaming!
2,Family Mode AI is Sadly Challenged,I am what can be charitably described as a casual gamer. I was hoping 'Family-mode' would allow me to be an armchair quarterback and not rely on my diminished eye-hand coordination for victorious outcomes. Family mode delivers the goods in this respect and allows me to call and run plays without running the risk of spilling my beverage and pretzels. Unfortunately the game's AI (Artificial Intelligence) in this mode is extremely challenged. The AI is powerless against half-back running plays. It is not unusual for me to run up a 35-0 lead by half time on a repertoire of three running plays. I was hoping for a more challenging experience without having to learn the nuances of the player-action of controls. Maybe they will fix this in the next release.
2,Did anyone test this game before it was released?!?!?,"This has to be one of the worst madden games ever to be released on any system! I think it beats the one when all the players were painted black and a ambulance used to come out to the field and run over players (97?). The glitches are just abnormal, you do a no huddle an get called for false start every freaking time?! The computer picks plays for you, you cant call time out, i can go on... It seriously makes you think that they rushed this game out for the wii before testing it."
2,Bland and uninspired,"I was greatly disappointed at the responsiveness of the wii-mote on this one. Your moves all seem a beat behind and many of the glitches should have been corrected prior to the release date. This is my first bad experience with the Wii and most of it stems from Madden just being a stale game overall, with very few changes over the last six years or so. There's just no excitement or ""punch"" in this year's version, no hard hitting action and the online mode is an utter disaster. 2 stars for the roster updates, but I can't recommend it unless you're desperate to see how Nintendo handled Madden. Using the nunchuck to control your players may also be just enough to finally push you into that mental institution. I love Nintendo but football may be best played on another system, sorry folks."
5,Much improved over 07,"-- Much more intuitive with gesture controls than 07, added controls give you more complete control over the game without going into the menus. Though a little tough getting used to having to hit the 1 or 2 buttons during the game. Timeout now tied tie MINUS button.-- Graphics moderately better (compared to 07 Wii). New graphics during tackles and catches (like deflections) much better than previous years.-- Online havent tried yet, sure there will be some initial glitches.-- This game is a winner if you like the gesture based play somewhat feeling like you are somewhat in the game. Also the Family play makes it fun for those people who like to pick up a controller now and then and play friends and family.-- Is it XBOX360 which is clearly the BEST out there?? NO but its fun if you can put aside the lack of graphics! Enjoy, I am!"
3,Madden 08,"This game is not as fun as it seems it would be, should have paid the extra for madden 2012"
3,NFL 08,Game looks great but the only issue was the use of the wand controller and the nunchuk for the Wii. Would have preferred the classic controller with this particular game.
4,I really enjoy this game.,"I really enjoy this game. The commentators are great. The graphics are pretty good. One problem is that whenever they put the screen on a game-cam and then press A, the screen turns blurry. Most of the time, the game seems quite realistic. This is my first football game of this type. We have no other gaming systems besides the Wii."
1,size doesn't match description,The actual size of the gas burner covers is smaller than the description. I had to return mine.
5,A POIGNANT MEMOIR OF PAUL BOWLES,"Paul Bowles' collaboration with the photographer Cherie Nutting was a very special endeavor. It was his last writing before his death in November 1999. This hardcover book is beautifully produced, and Mr. Bowles himself actually handwrote some of the text and wholeheartedly participated in it. He relied on the artistic ability of his friend to produce--over a period of many years--such quality photos of himself and those around him. This is a 'must have' book for any afficionado of Paul Bowles. I highly recommend it. It is inconceivable to me why anyone would write a negative review, but perhaps those are the unfortunate and jealous souls who were not included."
2,"OK, not what I had hoped","I thought I could just set an Aston Martin for a screen saver, maybe pull a couple good quotes from the movies as wav files - that sort of thing.All I got was one screen saver. It does have some good shots and great clips from movies through The World is Not Enough. The down side is, you can't just use a still image or use the sound bites for your ""Sounds"" control settings.If you just want another screen saver and you are a Bond fan, you may like this. It wasn't what I had expected. Since I had been using a blank screen previously, I currently have this set as my default screen saver. Ask me again in a week or so and I may be back to no screen saver though..."
4,Good for Bond Fans,"Despite the other review I read of this product, I think it would be neat and interesting, given that you or whoever you may give this too is a James Bond Fan. One review said It looked like a bad game, that's probably becuase its not a game. It full aoff pictures of the lovely Bond Girls and High-tech gagdetry we all wish we had. Its full of screen savers, pictures, and all sorts of other fun Bond related stuff."
3,ANOTHER SMOOTH READ FROM THE MASTER,"Published in the early seventies, this is one of Mr. Leonard's earlier novels. It is written with the same wit as of his more recent work. Yet it lacks the fun of his more recent books."
2,52 Pickup,I dragged and had no twists and turns. The characters were o.k. but nothing special. I finished it but it was hard to keep going.
1,52 Pickup,Too dark for my tastes. Needlessly exploitive and vulgar. The only redeeming social value was the fact that the protagonist truly suffered the consequences of adultery.
2,brake rotor,installed both rear rotors 01/15/2013. they fit perfectly and are true on the spin. hey for the price not bad. will have to see over timehow well they wear.
1,the end of reason,"As i read this book by Sam Harris(the end of faith) i found myself thinking that Mr Harris is unfortunately very well discribed in Psalm 14:1. I found the tone of his writing and the content of his writing to be very much like that of a 13 year old telling the world that he is smarter and better informed than his parents on all issues. He certainly embodies the words ""thinking themselves to be wise they became fools.""I consider the money I spent on his book and the time I spent reading it to be a total waste."
2,Lacks knowledge.,"I am a Christian. I am a former atheist and am used to argumentation for and against Christianity.His arguments against several of the tenets of Christianity are weak and betray, at best, a superficial knowledge of the topic.That is not to say that one cannot make many valid arguments against the Christian faith and against religion. It's just that he doesn't make them. At least as regards Chrisitanity, he presumes too many false premises to come up with a valid argument.If you are looking for a witty, sound-bite analysis of Christianity, you will find that in this book. If you are looking for a book that critiques Christianity in an erudite way, this is not that book.Personally, a reasoned discussion of the failings of Christianity is something I would appreciate and enjoy. We all have much to learn. But Sam just does not appear to have done his homework in getting to know his topic."
2,DOES FAITH REALLY KILL?,"Secularism is the modern day religion.The concern I have with this perspective is, when will secularism be a governmental movement to force the citizenry into conformity?Secularism is as arrogant and intolerant as any religious faith the author condemns.It is sad that the author isn't able to see secularism's logical progression into the very hate filled world he wishes to 'eliminate'."
3,"Starts Off Good, But Ends Badly","The book starts off with a convincing argument against religious faith and makes a compelling case for reason and scientific thought. The author then in my opinion completely loses his mindset with a long discourse on abstract ""spirituality"", and eastern mysticism in the chapter before the epilogue. He seems to suffer a fit of literary schitzophrenia that seems like it belongs in a different book altogether. Very confusing."
2,Disorganized religion bashing,"This book holds religion responsible for strife, terror and war. This is a highly simplistic view.The author cites many examples of hatred and bigotry attribited to religion. In this, he does not give a pass to any religion. All- Christianity, Judaism, Hinduism, and Muslim - are all taken to task for misbehaving from time to time.Many scientists who are known for rationality and resoning have reconciled faith/religion and scientific reasoning. Scientific method and belief in God can be reconciled and are not mutually exclusive.The book is very one sided beacuse it does not bother to state good things that have come out of various religions over the history of mankind.All religions have good and bad people who act in the name of religion to do good and bad things.Religion is like a knife. It can hurt someone or help someone. It depends on how people to choose to use religious teachings which are generally noble principles."
4,On the failure of religion,"Sam Harris' book offers a refreshing and much-needed analysis of the failure of religion and the devastating effect that faith-based ignorance has had on human progress. The End of Faith postulates an age when mankind is no longer ruled by fictitious gods, but realistically recognizes this may be generations in the future. In the meantime, Harris advises, we need to work with whatever moderate elements exist within Islam (which he correctly identifies as the most dangerous of all the religions) to blunt the aggressiveness of Muslim fundamentalists. Harris' arguments, sound within themselves, lose some of their force when he debates the need for spiritual experience in the human consciousness."
4,"Excellent perspective, unique discussion topics","This book offers entirely new arguments and counterpoints to the greatest story ever told. Sam Harris is an acclaimed philosopher, and a to-the-point, intellectual writer."
2,Be wary of some of those who are on your side.,"As others have said, this book suffers from the ""destroy the village in order to save it"" mentality that mirrors the attitudes of Harris' religious adversaries. He can rationalize his reverse intolerance any way he likes, but that's what it is.Like it or not, we secular humanists gain nothing by adopting the narrow tactics of religious extremists in responding to them. One makes common cause with one's ideological opponents as best one can---and sometimes that can't be done when the gulf is too wide. And sometimes it can. And that's how the world works.Diatribes like Harris' are, at best, distractions from trying to find those places of common accord, and a humanist jihad is NOT what secular humanists should be aspiring to."
4,End of Faith by Sam Harris,"I thank the author for having the courage to write this book. Sadly, he will probably receive death threats from many ""believers."" This book should be on the required reading list of every college worldwide. We desparately need rational discussion about the subject of ancient religious beliefs and the resulting terror and intolerance, ranging from child abuse to suicide bombers, that these belief systems have heaped upon the world."
3,A little dry but worth the time,"I like my atheism a little more polemic. I like bomb throwing so to speak. Don't expect it from Sam Harris. His logic is flawless and he doesn't really appeal to emotions. Very tough on Islam, but Letter To A Christian Nation is a leaner and meaner tool for atheists."
3,Great start but loses momentum,"I've rarely looked forward to reading a book as much as this one.The initial chapters didn't disappoint. Harris' critique of religion and it's effects on society in the first few chapters was clear, engaging and convincing. But as the book wound on, it began to lose its crisp focus, and it's analysis of how secular ethics could be used to form a basis for out actions was particularly tortured and unconvincing. Equally disappointing were his brief, cavalier treatments of eastern religions, mediation, and consciousness which would have been better left until Mr. Harris either had more time or more to say on the subjects.Would I recommend it? The first few chapters rate a clear 'yes', and I only wish that the second half were nearly as good."
3,Facing Facts,"When we disavow superstition and understanding scientific principles, then we will be closer to being fully evolved.Sam Harris is a thinking human being who knows how to express his thoughts in an intelligent way. It should be required reading for anyone who desires a better civilization devoid of fairy tales and false promises."
3,Disappointing,"More like 2.5 stars, I gave up about 2/3rds the way through it. I got it from this list of the ""Ten Best"" It started off fairly well, then he went into this 50 page anti-Muslim tirrade while only mentioning Judaism in passing, and the Old Testament but only from a fundamentalist Christian view the bible. Barely, and I mean like half a line, a word about how Israel treats the Palestinians or their world view in general.It would have been better if he'd stuck to generalities about how religion affects us all rather than picking on one sect and leaving out the rest."
3,Not the best...,"It looks that Sam Harris is too obsessed with religious estremism like suicie bombing, terror rooted from religion..etc. while he is at his best getting the philosphical ground for irrationality of religion, I believe he fails to dip into more sociological and pysochological factors that keep religion alive in society. The foremost flaw through the book is that he has spent too much time to contemplate on irrelevant subjects like pragmatism (he seeminlgy studided philosophy!) with no succesful linking to religion. I think Richard Dawkins is far better than Harris"
1,Fraud - this is a Jew beating up Christians and Muslims,"These are not the thoughts of an atheist or agnostic - this guy is Jewish - born and raised Jewish - and he doesn't say this anywhere. This explains why Judiasm is given such a ""light"" treatment in this ""scholarly"" work. Footnotes and bibliography can cover up bias for the uninitiated.See the review by ""JSW"" titled ""Not Pleased"".Also search the web for his bio and early life."
2,The road of modernism ends in the gas chambers of Auschwitz.,"The very fact that he cannot explain why religion continually trumps reason throughout our 4000 year history speaks to the very limits of his world-view. Apparently, atheists enjoy preaching to the choir as much as the religious right.It's not worth getting worked up over."
5,Resisting religious dogma puts your life at risk,"The world we live in today is more dangerous due to strongly held religious views. Some religious fanatics, or not, favor controlling other peoples' lives and views with fear mongering, threats and suicide bombings. Different religions claim that ONLY their beliefs are correct. They say All non- believers and infidels will pay for this in the end. Mr. Harris shows how to understand these threats and why everyone should realize what it means for life on this planet"
2,"Agreed, Sam, but don't be so vitriolic!","Yes, Sam, religion is bad for modern-day society. I agree. Do you have to be such a complete jerk about it though? Really, your style isn't going to win you any converts among the ""faithful"" now, is it? Generally if you openly call people stupid and evil, they aren't going to openly accept your overall thesis. Oh, and read some more Noam Chomsky before you spend several pages attacking him in your book, not one 118 page pamphlet. And if you think America's intentions in their foreign policies are nothing but good for everyone, you're incredibly naive. You're a good writer, I'll give you that, and you have some important points to make, but seriously, they're awash in such vitriol that they are basically moot."
2,The End of Faith,I noticed the endorsement by Alan Dershowitz so I checked the index and read all the comments listed under Israel before I started reading the book. Mr. Harris makes some good points but his bias against Muslims comes across loud and clear. There is nothing rational about his bias toward Muslims.
2,Well written; errant conclusions,This book is the simple extenuation of 19th century Western European unaffected by the lessons of the past hundred years.
1,Very Strange,"I was ok with what the book had to offer in the beginning, however after a couple of chapters the book became very strange in the thoughts that were being conveyed. I finished the book and probably won't look at it again. Parts of the book were very disturbing and others were very interesting to say the least."
1,"Are you greater than Moses? Or, for that matter, am I?","Let's take stock of where we are: On one side, Sam Harris says there is no God. On the other side, Moses says there is one true God. (Deut. 6:4). Since we all know who Moses is, the question is, ""Who is Sam Harris?""What nation did Harris lead out of slavery against the world's most powerful leader at the time? Oh. . . none? Well, when Harris gets finished with neuroscience school, maybe he can lead a nation out of captivity, give it law, a national identity, and march it toward the Promised Land. And when that nation survives against all odds over millenia to the present, maybe Harris' opinion on what's wrong with the world will be worth something. Until then, all those footnotes don't make Harris an expert on anything, least of all, what God can do.Until then, I'm with Moses.Dave HysingerSan Francisco"
5,A very important book,"This is a very clear summary of why religion is the cause of so much suffering in the world. It is clear and convincing, except for the last chapter, which I simply did not understand.Another (slight) shortcoming might be, that the author does not seem to distinguish between the USA, where Christian fundamentalism is definitely on the upswing ( up to and including such absurdities like considering ""Creationism"" a viable alternative to Darwin's evolution, apparently even by the current President George W. Bush!) and Europe (at least my native Germany), where religion plays hardly any role in public life. However, with the USA being the only power left, this omission might be o.k.There is no ""political correctness"" in this book, it calls things by their name."
5,A much needed but bitter pill without the sugar,"A much needed dose of secular argument to combat the irrationality and dogmatism creeping into political life. Enlightened politicians can still be found willing to speak out on society's ills but they are being effectively muzzled when the ills impinge upon what are increasingly regarded as religious areas, stem cell culture, abortion et al. Harris' attack on moral equivalence is particularly relevant in Australia's policy of multiculterism where all religions are considered equally acceptable without question."
1,Starts well but this man is crazy...,"I bought this book following seeing some excellent Sam Harris videos on YouTube and just from picking up he was part of the modern Atheist movement. The books starts really well but when you get to around chapter 4 or 5, Sam's views on Israel and the current interventions of America come out. Sam appears totally pro-war, his views on Israel are shocking, one line about how 'no neighbours could be as tolerant as the Israeli's have been about Palestinians' I found totally bemusing. He denounces Chomsky for stating America operates like a terrorist state and then goes on to detail a range of atrocities commited by Americans. This book feels like an argument for war with any under developed nation.I have read Dawkins & Hitchens and Sam should not be put in the same category at all. I would go as far as to say I hate this book and feel totally embarrassed for endorsing Sam Harris as a rational thinker. This book is for Atheists who watch Fox News - avoid at all costs!"
1,Failed Apologia for Atheism,"This is a weak and naive apologia for atheism as a cure for war and other social ills, which Harris accuses Christianity, Islam, and other religions of inflicting on humanity. While condemning theists for supposedly attempting to impose their beliefs on society, thereby fomenting conflict, he attempts to impose his own ideas on society with sledgehammer rhetoric. Catholics, Protestants, Muslims-they are all ignorant, troublemaking malcontents. To explain why the 20th Century's most bellicose societies-Nazi Germany, for example-rejected God but failed to prosper, he maintains that they were imitating the tactics used by religions. Yeah, right, Hitler and Stalin prayed the rosary and took in lepers. The heat of provocative rhetoric does not a good book make; only cool, dispassionate reason leads to truth."
2,"hit me over the head again, please","I am, what I would consider, a moderately religious person. Apparantly I am much more dangerous to the world than your average bomb-toting terrorist. I really tried to keep an open mind and see his point of view while reading this. I think I would have had a better shot at that if I wasn't feeling personally attacked again and again. Those of us who wish to embrace tolerance and live an example of peaceful coexistance to our children are worse than fanatical fundamentalists. According to Mr. Harris tolerence is the wrong path to peace."
4,Faith's Forked Tongue...,"The idea's pitched by Sam Harris are cutting. I had a much more detailed review typed out but it (ah-ha!)got accidentally erased. Alas, I get to the salient points:1. Great Conceptual Achievment. (Must read before one graduates High School). This mind stretch sends Faith back to ""strawberry fields forever...""2. At times, no kidding, I had re-read a sentence 3-5 times to either grasp it's profound meaning, or mete out the author's meandering boat to china syntax. That is my only criticism. Sam could have dumbed it down for a lay audience. I suppose THIS WAS the dumbed down one by Sam's standards. One needs to have an SAT score of 1600+ not to be challenged by the neuro acumen.3.The copious footnotes are a book unto themselves, which I read separately as to avoid disrupting the flow. Otherwise you find yourself chopping and flipping.4. Bad reviews if you check, are sponsored by Faith mongers. I have spoken. Agnostic J."
3,Religion not equal God,"I have to agree that many of the hurts of humans are related or proveked by religion. But, I think that the word religion is no longer and should no longer relate to God, that is because religion has become an individual's idea or opinion of who God is. I think , no you think, and then a religion is created. One's opinion of God doesn't mean that that is the character of God. God is God and that's it...Thus yes...religion is a great dangeour for a society and it has been. But don't blame God...that's all.."
5,"The End of Faith:Religion, Terror and Future of Reason","It was very thought provoking, raising questions as to the changing face of religion"
2,where is our source for decision-making?,"It is of course true that sacred texts are the most dangerous there are. If one wants to do something truly evil, one needs the aid of Scripture. As Shakespeare points out, the Devil quotes Scripture. Yet what other foundation is there for humankind? While we need to trust in reason, in science, and in our basic humanity - we have also seen these sources distorted and dangerous.The main point of the book - that we need to question other's faith - that it does matter what our neighbor believes - is a vital point- absolutely essential to our survival. I would hope for a more nuanced work, one that distinquished between faith that encourages and builds community - rather than one that divides ."
1,"disappointing, says one anti-theist","while I looked forward to reading this I was immediately disappointed to discover that the author is in facta self-confessed meditator, interested in the spiritual and/or mental offerings of Buddhism, in particular. I read some interviews with him elsewhere and there was often a tolerance for the Eastern traditions of religion (which he tries to rescue as philosophies). But those religions are faith-based and often full of all kinds of metaphysical babble (reincarnation, superpower spiritual teachers), including the Dalai Lama.so, if you're really anti-spiritual and are looking for kindred authors I would steer you away from this author.some of us have had enough of all the religions of the world. Richard Dawkins is far better and less hypocritical."
1,Neither reason nor objectivity in author's hypocrisy,"Mr. Harris, a secular Jew, critiques the irrational and destructive aspects of Islam (he's absolutely venomous toward Muslims) and Christianity whilst wholly ignoring those same aspects of Judaism and Zionism. This author claims to have freed himself from religion through objective reasoning. He desperately needs to apply any latter facilities to free himself from gross racism and hypocrisy."
4,Timely and scary,"This book speaks volumes for the times we live in. It's so true that the fine line between reason and religion is ever so fragile, and that, despite our best efforts, there will always be terrorism in the world. As I came to the part in the book where the author claimed that Israel would incite a massive war between the mideast and the west, war had just broken out between Israel and Hezbollah, with the conflict in Iraq still raging, and tensions between Iran and the rest of the West further increasing. It startled me into believing that the conflict between people in this world over whose god is god will someday incite a global catastrophe."
4,"Not what IS, but what is not!","Many of us don't know what is, but unlike most, we won'tsettle for myth in order to fill that human void. Excellent for truth seeker."
4,Deep!,"Sam Harris' book ""Letter to a Christian Nation"" is much more blunt and easy to read, but this book provides the academic research to back ""Letter."" So for those who want to delve deeper and have data to back up your arguments, then this is a must read."
4,also a primer for intelligent young'uns,"When young people -- say, age 15-25 -- are intelligent, they start looking for spiritual options, usually in the form of religions they weren't brought up with. ""The End of Faith"" is about the sweetest alternative to those alternatives. Sam Harris shows how one can replace institutionalized wishful thinking (a.k.a. mass hysteria) with one's own gracious thoughts, elegant reasoning, and basking in the glories of a universe that is laid out before our very eyes.Bill Maher once quipped, ""Religion is a neurological disorder."" ""The End of Faith"" proves it. It also shows you the answer to Life's Ultimate Question: being kind whenever possible is the highest moral calling."
3,Recommended..But Could've Been Better,"This book is definitely not the best book that i have ever read on the topic. Sam Harris is not as convincing in his opinion as Richard Dawkins. I also think that Harris gets really off track when he starts questioning Noam Chomsky, Arundhati Roy and questioning politics. I also feel that some of what Harris said came across as arrogant, making it seem as though the United States is the best of the best, and all other countries are inferior, what this has to do with religion i don't know. Harris used this book mostly to cut down Islam rather than all the major religions. I think Harris' second effort - A Letter To A Christian Nation was much better. but still read the book."
2,"Great polemic, terrifying conclusions.","I really enjoyed Harris' critiques of the Big Three (Judaism, Christianity and Islam), but I found his conclusions startling and scary. He suggests that we ought to take action against fundamentalists simply for their beliefs. While I agree that fundamentalists of any stripe are a massive threat to democracy and freedom, the idea of persecuting religious people for their beliefs -- even extremely dangerous ones -- is, to me, a chilling one."
3,Thought Provoking,"A few months ago, I left the Congregational Church because I was having increasing difficulty accepting the basic tenets of Christian faith. Since then, I have read a number of books on faith - most recently ""The End of Faith"" by Sam Harris. From the beginning of this book, I was telling myself ""Yes, that is how I feel.""After I finished the book, I reflected on the thoughts of Professor Robert Greg of Willamette University who addressed a seminar on the subject at the Congregational Church years ago. He said something to the effect that it is unclear whether God created man or man created God - but does it matter? His thesis was that perhaps man NEEDED faith in God.In summary, this book is sure to stimulate thought but its conclusions are debatable.Three stars because it wasn't, for me, an easy read."
1,"""reprobates to my left, elect on my right - my a** is grass""","Yep, you're in the wrong universe, Mr. Harris.In the amazon.com author's interview he admitted that he'd written the book to please his atheist mother for crying out loud.Atheists often embarass themselves, usually when they open their mouth or start tapping on a keyboard; but they're going to have a hard time living this guy down..."
1,Educated into imbecility,"Once again we encounter someone who fears Truth. The author is a typical modernist who likes to come up with excuses about why he has no faith. Being open to everyones beliefs is Ok, as long as they don't discuss it with anyone. This author is among the minority of mankind who has no faith in God. Obviously he fears faith combined with reason. Don't be misguided into thinking that everyone thinks like he does. Ye of little faith, ye of no faith."
1,Claptrap,"This book is complete and utter heresy! I'm giving it one star only because Amazon's ratings don't allow negative integers. Not only does this chump have no idea what he's talking about, but he seems to be a coward also. Not worth the paper it took to print it. Pass on this one folks."
1,"Mr Harris, do you remember?","Mr Harris do you remember Hitler and Stalin? Both had indeed much in common, above all they were both atheist and killed millions in a very short time."
5,New Morality for the Scientific Age,"A wonderfully written book that makes no apology about the stand it takes - that religion is anathema to rational living, and following the Word (of various religions) written 100s of years ago can only sustain terrorism and hatred that has been unleashed today.Gives a coherent (though impractical?) and alternate theory if we were to expect living peacefully in the present times. However the book has more value for ruthlessly laying down on what is wrong with religion today - and why it will continue to be so unless some drastic changes are effected."
2,Needs more research,"This book denies evolution in religion and cites its stagnation as a problem in modern times because of extremists and fundamentalists who interpret religious texts literally. Though I do not personally subscribe to any religion, this seemingly atheistic bias of the author seems condescending to his intended audience, and therefore, ineffective. Additionally, the author needs to conduct more research in religious texts and traditions or consult other people who have studied these things. His information seems suspect at points. Read it if you're curious, but don't just believe everything the author says. There are inaccuracies, falacies, and misrepresentations throughout this book."
1,Flavor of the month,"I always find it interesting when some pseudo-intellectual feels they have ""secret"" information that 90% of the world does not possess. Usually they are trying to see something . . .This book is a waste of time. Many other atheist writers have done a far better job of detailing their position, using a logical progression and thoughtful analysis. One may disagree with their final conclusion, but one must respect how they arrived there. Harris is simplistic and patronizing, I would think that both atheists and believers would laugh at him. He is the current flavor of the month, and will be irrelevent shortly."
1,Shifting Blame Solves Nothing,"Blaming religion for the actions of a few ignorant radicals is like blaming a car for running over someone. The vehicle is not the problem, it's the person using it. Shifting the blame like this probably makes Mr. Harris feel better about his own lack of faith and his misunderstanding of religion. Humans naturally fear the unknown and the irrational ones, rather than trying for some level of understanding & knowledge, would do away with it. In the long run, eliminating religion to avoid acts of terror & violence would solve nothing. The crazy people would still be crazy and evil people who thrive on making others miserable would still find a way to do it. Belief in God, not just religion, can make this world a better place. If only more people tried it."
4,A good quick read on the issues surrounding the dangers of faith.,"This book read more as a primer for the subject of faith as a weapon. It covered the dangers related to faith directed education and revolved primarily around the extremist muslim faith and the impact that sectarian dogmatism plays when allowed to expand unchecked. There was great emphasis to keep the focus not far from the risks inherent in government regulated faith as well as the issues surrounding the schism in the US with regards to the political and theistic ""wedge"" being driven into the US society by potentially dangerous extremist dogmatic fanatics."
4,End of Faith,A must read for all. Eye opening. It explains with numerous historical examples how we humans do not learn what not to do and thus how we create and recreate misery almost exactly or worse. Very well written. All five stars!!
4,"The End of Faith: Religion, Terror, and the Future of Reason","A most interesting and - likely - very controversial book. It talks critically about many sacred cows - beliefs, faith, religion - and argues about the damage they have caused in human history."
4,best of the three pop atheists,"In terms of the recent 'pop' atheists, Harris certainly ranks as the most serious thinker (Dawkins lacks any in-depth understanding of what he criticizes, while Hitchens refuses to even cite sources for his caricatures). As a sympathizer, I still burn out on the same old tired, 'religion is bad, atheism is good' rants, yet this book steers clear of those kinds of juvenile statements. Instead, it offers a constructive account of how what people believe does affect our world in a very real way. So much so, that it is crucial to understand why people believe the things they believe and why, in some cases, we need to present counter-arguments. If nothing else, those on the religious side of things needs to take this book seriously and address it on its own terms."
4,Reason: why is it so evasive?,"In this book Mr. Harris paints a bleak future for a world in which religion plays a significant role. The first few chapters were cohesive, thoroughly engaging and chock full of meaningful quotes I simply had to write down in order to remember them later. While the later chapters took a more philosophical turn that I didn't find nearly as interesting and that felt only tangentially related to the subject, I still recommend this to others who consider themselves reasonable, intelligent thinkers. Also recommended is Harris' companion work, 'Letter to a Christian Nation.'It is a relief to see more books on this topic being published, asking -- pleading with, perhaps -- the human populace to bring *reason* back into intelligent thinking when it comes to faith and religion, before we destroy ourselves."
2,Thin and Overwrought,"I continue to press my way through this book, which is not too difficult given the author's passionate style, but alas there is more style than substance here; more bombast than carefully crafted argument. Indeed, Harris approaches his subject with a religious fervor that belies his call for an end of faith. Opting to replace religion with rationalism (nothing new in this assertion) -- Harris builds his case against religion on half truths, broad generalizations and a caricature of religious life/experience that is naive at best and intellectually dishonest at its worst."
3,This book should be read by the Evangelical Right,"Sam Harris presents an interesting study of faith and religion. It reinforced many of the thoughts I had on religion in particular.The only complaint I have with the book is that it's heavily footnoted. Which is typical for an academic I suppose, but makes it laborious to read."
3,Good and Difficult,"This is a book that will appeal to the high IQ reader. For the rest of us, the treatment of Islam and its facets is the best part of the book, with points well made. After that, I found it hard to comprend the rest of the points presented."
4,End of Faith,"Many people are beginning to realize that religion is a threat to the peace and security of the world. In the near future world leaders will sanction the destruction of the world's religious system. The Bible foretells a time when such an event would occur. Revelation chapter 17. Mystery Babylon the Great - a symbol of the world's false religious system whixh has caused war, hatred, intolerance, bigotry, ect. for many millenium. If you compare the beliefs, doctrine, customs, and holidays of many of today's religions with the religions of ancient Babylon you can see the similiarities. So-called Christianity 'borrowed' most of its beliefs from mystery Babylonian pagan religion and put a 'Christian' label on it. What most people believe to be Christianity was created Roman Emperor Constantine the Great and disguised as Christianity. Mystery Babylon the Great, depicted as a prostitute riding on the back of a beast-like political system."
1,"A nice rant, but nothing more","I don't really see the difference between the left wing militant atheists and the right wing militant christians. Harris spends a lot of time on how religion is dangerous to society, when in fact what is dangerous is extremism. As a man with some very extreme views, Harris is the real danger. Never trust an author who doesn't take the time and effort to remove himself from his own arguement enough to examine it and wonder if he's become as bad as his ""enemies"". A very disapointing, and at time frightening, book."
1,"""Crucify Him!""","""Crucify Him!"" if Sam Harris were present at the time when Pilot offered the Jews the choice between Jesus and Barabbas, Sam would have been the one shouting ""Barabbas!"" for the murderer and ""Crucify him!"" for Jesus.His is hell-bent on eradicating Christianity and his book sales and lecture circuit have empowered him to monstrous proportions.He deserves no more energy from me than these few sentences. If zero stars were a choice, that would be my selection.Jesus Christ In His Own Words"
2,plea for evidence lacks evidence,The author's argument comes down to a plea for all of us to require evidence for the things that we believe but he fails to satisfy his own requirement by failing to provide evidence for many of the claims that his arguments are based on.It's as if he's asking us to take his rejection of faith on faith. I was very disappointed because I was eager to side with him in this yet I still found it very hard to do.
3,My Opinion,"I am one of those few who believe that science and religion are not opposing forces. I believe the Scientific ""Big Bang"" (start of the universe and all scientific laws of physics) was the work of God. I believe that mathematics is the language of God. I believe that God intended us to use our minds in order to better understand his creation through science. The problem here is not religion, it is ORTHODOX religion, or what I call ""inflexible"" religion. I would also like to point out that the author is demonstrating his own kind of inflexible orthodoxy in this book - the orthodox church of science.However, I also believe in the right to free speech. For that reason, I give this 3 stars in that it takes a very unpopular stance and by doing so, furthers free speech for all of us, thus keeping democracy healthy. Once again, I would like to state that religion and science are, to me, not contrasting forces."
2,Not a bad thesis but the tirade against Islam turned me off,"The book starts out well but he lost me with the chapter called ""The Problem with Islam."" Kind of reminded me of another religion labeled a problem several decades ago. It was incredibly imperious and I do not believe the author has sufficient experience with Islamic culture to make the sweeping generalizations he does."
4,An arguement for atheism,"This book only reinforces one of the few quotes by Karl Marx that has lasting value, regardless of one's social class - ""Religion is the opiate of the masses"". A well written, well thought out book that clearly presents the case of the evil which is fraught in the cause of religion. This is as relevant today as it has been throughout the history of proseltizing religions - Christianity and Islam."
5,Outstanding and thoughtful,"Mr. Harris writes well and the book is outstanding and thoughtful. Organized religion is and always will be a dangerous opiate for the masses no matter what myth drives the conduct. Homo sapiens (humans)will always only be homo sapiens. Humans never have been nor ever will be fortune tellers, Gods, or diciples of whatever religious myth one chooses to identify with. I did enjoy the book, it is thoughtful and well written."
5,A must read!!!,"Sam Harris, in this book, does a great job in criticizing religious faith. With his great insights in eastern and western philosophy and neuroscience, Sam does a superb job in conveying to the readers how to live life intellectually as well as morally fulfilled without actually believing in any supernatural God or falling prey to any superstitions or absurdities. The resources he cited at the end of this book are excellent stuff to read as well. Please read this book! Besides, I also highly recommend reading Letter to a Christian Nation by the same author."
4,"Excellent, if imperfect, critique of religion's dangers","Anyone who doesn't read this book is missing out. The End of Faith won the PEN award for nonfiction and deserved it. This is a devastating indictment of religion and the harm it causes. Just the chapter on Islam was worth the price of the book.Harris ranges far and wide, from the Inquistion's horrors to honor killings in the Arab/ Muslim world. He mercilessly attacks dogmatism, from the moral equivalence of the pacifist left to the insane attacks on birth control on the right. The part where he skewers the drug war was terrific. The book isn't perfect; Harris endorses unscientific paranormal beliefs (e.g. reincarnation and ESP). I also don't understand his argument that Communism is a ""political religion."" But,overall, it's still well worth reading."
4,Truth teller with tough task,"Harris has a very hard task, namely, to argue to people who rely on faith for their big ideas that such reliance is futile and will spawn bad blood all around. Such people don't much listen to reason, so why would they suddenly listen to Harris's argument? Still, for the many who hover between reason and faith (and none can dispense with reason entirely) the book should nudge them away from trusting in faith, given its clear demonstration that faith is completely unreliable as a source of truth. (Why else are there over 4000 different religions in the USA alone?)"
5,If you want to be challenged..,"The End of Faith: Religion, Terror, and the Future of Reason is one of the most thought provoking books I have ever read and the timing couldn't be better. Everyone needs to read this book. Sam Harris nails it."
2,"Great idea, but...","Very heavy handed and written like a Ph.D thesis - too wordy and rambling. Also, the points made have kernels of logic, but often spin out into free association and lack cohesiveness. I look forward to either a better writer tackling this important idea or Mr. Harris becoming a better writer and revisiting the topic."
2,Far Too Simplistic,"While The End of Faith is provocative, it is deeply flawed. The largest problem with his argument is that he simply accepts fundamentalism's claim to be the only correct way to be religious in the Western tradition; what he calls ""religious moderates"" are, for him, simply fooling themselves. Harris's dismissal of more sophisticated forms of Western spirituality are glib and superficial, and his analysis of Eastern spirituality pays insufficient attention to cultural or historical context. The book makes a clever extended undergraduate essay, but no more than that."
3,"Decent Term Paper, Bad Book","Harris obviously just got out of a neuroscience program at Stanford and wants to impress us all with how much h learned. His thesis is simple: The world's major religions are all predicated on ancient texts which contain outrageous and barbaric tenets, and therefore all religion should be banned.He is especially hard on Islam, basically saything they are in a stage of development akin to the Catholic Church at the time of the Inquisition. Regrettably he takes 250 pages to say this over and over."
3,Interesting and detailed analysis of religions in the world,"The concepts were believable in this book , which , by the way, was not written to appeal to a predefined audience. It is an overview of how all religions have their quirks and how people can rationalize whatever they have faith in-with or without substantiation or proof of their belief.A history of the major religions in the world are given throughout the book, including atheists ""beliefs"".I found the book extremely well researched...one look at the bibliography and notes, and you will see a third of the book is reference to his sources. That is commendable and appreciated. Still, I think way too much material was crammed into this one book. Harris should have generalized a bit more and saved the extensive research for future books."
3,Good start but needs more passion,"Sam is kind of losing his touch here. He previous books have been much more succinct than this one. The topic, lets start questioning the beliefs of religious people, is very good but Sam took too much of an academic approach and thus will not reach the general masses needed to make any real change in the world.I really wish he could have shown a real justification for an emotional argument; for instance why blind faith is unhealthy for us all.Sam could have taken on the ""liberal establishment"" more for their cowardly and uncaring assent to people's religiosity. That religion can be abusive to the person who subscribes to it is undeniable but `liberals' seem to not care about religious people for fear that those same people will confront them and their unhealthy beliefs and ways. A truly liberal person is liberal with their love and thus would care about all people enough to confront their unhealthy practices and would appreciate that same kind of caring back."
3,Many interesting points/some questionable conclusions,"Accepting something on faith is based on ignorance and a learned aversion to critical thought. Harris makes this point compellingly. Other conclusions are marred by flawed reasoning. He condemns violence if the ""bad guys"" are guilty and justifies it if the ""good guys"" do it. Too many times, one reads ""it is obvious that"" when no such obviousness has been established. His rationale for torture is inexcusable. Overall, a worthwhile read so long as one is mindful that some of his sources are poorly chosen (they reinforce his biased beliefs about the world) and his logic comes from wrongheaded starting points (if war is ok then so is torture)."
2,"Good idea, poor development","The idea that we all need to question religious beliefs is long overdue and a good one. And it is true that it has been sort of taboo to do this, although there are other titles that explore the same subject. But the author questions religions from a high tower, as if his way of seeing the world is the correct one. His political views are hard to swallow too. For instance, to say that we, as americans, have more ""moral wealth"", and that when we bomb, ""we are killing them for their own good"", are things that I disagree, and, quite frankly, turned me off for this book. Lots of cheap shots, out-of-context attacks on Arundati Roy and Noam Chomsky - there is absolutely nothing wrong in disagreeing with their ideas, but attack the ideas, not the person, and attack them with better ideas."
2,Great Undergrad Thesis,"I was really looking forward to reading this book, but only got about 20 pages into it when I realized that it was reading like a fleshed-out undergrad philosophy thesis, self-indulgent ""witty"" endnotes and all. I looked in the back cover, and sure enough, it was written by a philosophy undergrad at Stanford. Now, there's nothing wrong with that as such, but if you are interested in real scholarship on the topic of the influence of religion (particularly fundamentalist faith) on the world, then there is really no greater tome at large today than Karen Armstrong's ""The Battle for God"". I was genuinely shocked to see that Mr. Harris did not cite to that work a single time. He does get off a few good bon-mots, but that's not worth the price of the book. If you want solid scholarship, please read Ms. Armstrong's book."
3,Good Info but written to impress,"I found the book to be interesting and it brought to light many compelling arguments but it also felt like a book written with a narcissistic attempt at impressing the authors intellectual peers. Whenever possible the author used uncommon words that he must know the average reader wouldn't know, in an attempt at sounding overly intellectual. Other than that, a good read with somewhat convincing arguments and added but didn't define my overall understanding of the subject matter."
2,"Interesting topic, but tedious treatment","I agree with the author's general conclusion (religion does more harm than good, and we should discard it) but I can't recommend this book. The author drones on and on about the philosophical aspects of morality and ethics. Ugh. Some people may enjoy reading that sort of stuff (for page after endless page), but I'd rather have a root canal."
5,"In all your ""getting"" get understanding","It would be a tremendous waste of cognitive effort to explain why people who believe Harris is either a god-hating waste-of-time infidel who will roast in the fires of hell for his intolerance or a wishy-washy mystical soothsayer who only marginally opposes dogmatism are sorely misguided. This is a book that deserves deep contemplation and does not read like many others. Treat it as a very long conference, as a very learned man conferring upon his listeners some very important bits of wisdom. Harris approaches this topic in a manner that makes the reader thirst for more information and question some deeply held beliefs about one's own faith, morality, and happiness.It's easy to write a good review of a book whose premises you agree with. I must say that I found little in this book that did not accord with either my intuition or biases. Still, this is an excellent book, a masterpiece, and should be required reading for all in the West."
5,This book changed my life,"Because of this book I am no longer a christian. This book should come with a warning though. Because becoming an atheist means having your reality flip upside down. And this can be a very difficult process. I have read this book multiple times. bought it in paperback and audio CD. Every time I read it I discover something more. My favorite part is at the very end. Sam Harris discusses rational mysticism. This is controversial among atheist. But Sam does not try to cater to atheist. Rather he challenges you. Sam if your reading this, please write a book on rational mysticism."
5,Fuel for endless passionate debates...,"With arguably no topic in America more contentious and hotly debated than religion (oddly enough), it is important to ponder the rationality of stated and unstated religious wars (or just one-on-one killings for the same purposes). In absence of a compulsory high-school course on ""comparative world religion and philosophy,"" this book, as a minimum, provides a few interesting observations. Overall, an entertaining read, sure to fuel endless passionate debates (in which I have absolutely no intention to partake)."
4,"Relevant, outstanding, and depressing","I can just imagine your typical Bible or Koran-thumper's eyelashes burning as they read this book. That is, if anybody of said persuasion would actually even glance at this book.The author's pungent attack of religious unreason is exemplary and brave, while his conclusions are sobering, and frankly, depressing.One reservation I have is that on the last chapter or two he takes a sharp left turn and goes New Age on us. I failed to understand exactly what he bases his beliefs on, and it only makes you wonder why in this section he seems to be suspending much of the same reasonability standards that he had been championing up to that point. He actually addresses this in a newly added afterword. Furthermore, I've since read an interview of him in which the interviewer calls him on this very point, but yet once again failed to make a case for his stance, in my opinion. Hence the 4 stars.Still, I think this is a very relevant and outstanding work."
2,I laughed...I cried...I almost threw up,I really only have three things to say: THE END OF FAITH...ummmmm that idea sure seemed to work for Marx didn't it. There never could be an end of faith...if religion was to vanish...it would be replaced with civil religion. The people who give this book rave reviews....are...well....let's say a little low on the intelligence scale
1,Threw it in the trash,"Whatever Sam Harris - I could not get through chapter one, and this book is going to the trash can."
1,This is horrible,"I realize that this book catering to an audience that is of Mr. Harris's belief, but I find this book disturbing. Mr. Harris says that he believes that the world should abandon religion because it is not rational or reasonable. What is the alternative? Trading one God for another? Science and logic then become god. I would rather put my faith in God and Christ then Science and ""logic"" that says I'm an accident, I have no purpose in life but to be born and to die, and there is no hope. If everyone believed what Mr. Harris is promoting this world would not be a place worth living."
1,The Strength of Faith...,"This book reminds me why Faith needs to be so strong. When you have Faith, the small-mindedness of this author cannot fail to touch you as ignorant--and this book as pitiable at best.In an attempt to explain away the sheer strength that Faith brings to our lives by replacing it with an anti-belief, is merely trading one faith for another. And to believe in nothing is the weakest belief there is.The multitudes who have collectively hailed this book as exceptional seem to miss the point of Faith entirely, as the author himself has, bringing a different type of dogma into being.Just another bandwagon philosophy (like so many religions are), made obvious by the peanut gallery of reviewers listed here."
1,Preaching to the choir,"The reviewers who panned this book are quite correct: it is fundamentally dishonest. Ignoring historical and sociological perspective, Harris cobbles together a diatribe against ""faith,"" especially Islam, to pander to those who make the facile argument that Islamic faith is to blame for much that troubles our world today. He's preaching to a large choir, of course, and that promises a best seller."
3,hard hitting advocacy,"I knew what to expect but was taken aback by what seemsa rather vitriolic way of making the author's point.The examples of the horrors of what faith can do are extreme and they leave no space for the reader to recall that faith has also done a lot of good things over the centuries.Still, it is a good review of what tends to be forgotten,namely how much religion has held back progress, and how difficult it is for a religious person to reconcile dogma with objective reality.This book fills a crying need, but it takes a strong stomach to read it. Without the authors intention it could come across as another way of being dogmatic."
5,Low Profile. Easy to clean. Sturdy.,"This is my second mat from Brookstone - needed two different sizes for our camp. We have doors which swing in with minimal clearance and this mat fits perfectly. Best of all, they don't move on the floor. You can scuff feet and vacuum and the mat stays in place. Even after repeated cleanings in four seasons, these mats perform beautifully. They retain their color and look the same even after three years. They are terrific!"
1,Don't last,"These are really low profile and vacuum easily. They also trap small amounts of water pretty well. Unfortunately the thin veneer of material on top of the rubber mat begins delaminating after the first month of use. After that, the product quickly becomes ugly and ineffective. I feel I was ripped off with this product."
1,"extremely ugly, poorly made, no return shipping",This mat is no more than an ugly 10 dollar mat you would see in a garage or restaurant kitchen for employees to stand on . It is not low profile and therefore will not lay under your door. Plus it cost a fortune to send back. Worst purchase ever from amazon/brookstone
4,Excellent book for new and experienced karate students,"This is a book for new and experienced karate students. However, without a background in some karate basics, a new student will not get much out of this text. The drills and variations of different approaches to sparring will be of value for both students and instructors. This is a comprehensive book on the formal aspects of karate and the drills will help if you are entering karate contest. I question the value of many of the drills for learning how to actually defend yourself on the street. Nevertheless, it is a good text to use in combination with actual hands-on training under a competent Japanese karate style instructor.Rating: 4 stars. Joseph J. Truncale (Shotokan Karate Self-Defense Techniques: Practical Combat Karate for the street)"
4,This is GOOD,Okay this was good but not so good. The walkthrough did give info and helpful. But the post game part iakes some time to go through to find what you want. The PokeDex is greatOnly 1 problem1. More for Danger in the Dungeon and Powerful Pokemonand way better pokemon in Danger in the Dungeon
4,Not literature.,"I bought this for my older son because he does not read very much. While it is not an art work of literature, it makes him read. It is a fairly good guide, and he enjoys the things he learns for his video games. Need say no more."
1,For tiny heads,"Bought this for my kids for Halloween. It shipped late so didn't end up using it, but I opened the package to see if it was worth keeping and they were very small. This is not advertised as being for kids but, it barely fit the heads of 10 and 12 yr olds and definitely didn't fit my head. I returned it."
5,better than expected,It came sealed and upopen which was not expected. Very glad to be able to get for such a great price! Better than I expected.
3,Scary Illustrations,"The text of the book is delightful, the illustrations frightful. I found the illustrations dark and unpleasant. Not suitable for my 3 year old."
1,I didn't make it past day 2,It was too difficult for me with the headaches and feeling drained. I wouldn't recommend starting this when you have to work.
3,My reviews,I liked the 5day until the fourth day when I had severe cramps but other than that it was a good product and the craveless really helped me stay from eating during the fast
3,I think 3 days should about do 'er.,"Wanted to flush my system and quit caffeine, junk food etc before I started my workout program.Thoughts:There's a lot of pills to swallow, but I didn't really mind. A lot of people have complained about the horrible taste of the fiber. Honestely, I thought it was bland, but not bad tasting at all. I mixed with water only and it reminded me of drinking a finely powdered sawdust. It didn't taste bad at all though.Bowel movements were natural and not runny, although they did come with slightly more urgency than normal. After the middle of the second day, my bowels were clean, and the only thing running through me was the fiber and pills I was taking with the kit.After the third day I decided that I like food after all and quit.I feel like the product works, but I think that 5 days is a bit excessive and probably not that healthy to do. If you use this program, I think you could do it for 2-3 days and achieve the same results if you drink enough water."
4,Effective!,"So let me start to say the cleanse, was pretty effective. The first 2 days was torture! I followed it through, but did not have much bowel movement till the 3rd day. I had to take an extra colon clear pill like stated on the box. Overall it was a good experience, just don't give up. I did drink a lot of juice to help me function. When I was hungry, I just went to sleep. The fiber mix was disgusting, and there was a lot of pills to take. On the 5th day, I did lose 5lbs throughout the days of fasting. I would do it again."
2,no effect,"I use the Super cleanse for many years, so decided to try one more similar supplement from same line. It probably works as a laxative, but I haven't noticed any other effects."
1,Do Nothing,"after 5 days nothing , I was just 3 times for #2 and should be 15 times , I was starving 5 days and not even lost a gram , the secret is out , it is worthless waste of money a really wallet cleanser nothing else . My doctor said colon clean itself every 3 days automatic without any supplements , my metabolism shut down after 3 days completely and not one gram of fat was burned not a waste produced so it really made not sense ,very disappointed"
3,Great results but bad side effects,I've done 3 of these and had great results both in feeling better and weight loss. The problem came when my Dr found elevated liver enzymes indicating a toxic reaction to something in this mixture.Kind of a serious side effect'
4,I love this darn product!,"I ordered this product twice this year ecxcept i had to wait 2 months because it was out of stock everywhere i looked! Gave mne awesome results and got rid of excess water in my body, didnt make me constipated or made me run to bathroom for my life. Pills size are decent, bitter as heck though, the fiber cleanse isnt bad either i use water all the time. Did i mention how much I love this product? :D I feel like stacking up on more just incase it goes out of stock again ahhahah."
3,Sense of control,I decided to start this program the day after Easter. I must say I was suprised at how I didn't feel hungry and how easy it was to pass up all the left over sweets at home and at the office. I woke up on the second day feeling more refreshed then I have in a long time. Half way into my second day I started to feel dizzy though and had a small bowl of oatmeal and fruit. I only lasted a day and a half but found it very helpful to reconnecting with my true hunger compared to my mental cravings. I plan to use the rest of the kit in one day increments when I need it again. The only real downfall to the product is the number of pills you need to swallow. I was so tired of swallowing that I found it difficult to take all the recommended product. I would have given it a higher rating if not for all the pills you needed to take.
3,Starving,"Like many others, I started this cleanse in good spirits. After a day, I was miserable, starving, and pooped out.If you do the cleanse and still eat fruits and veggies, you'll be much happier (although maybe less cleansed?).Basically, I don't have the willpower it takes to not eat for 5 days, but some of you might be better at it."
1,Makes you ill!,"Hi, I tried this product based on the reviews and followed it exactly the first day. The fiber is gross and all the pills you have to swallow is really unrealistic. I suspect they do this on purpose though to get you to drink your fluids. If you're spending all your time drinking water swallowing pills and washing down the nasty fiber, then of course you won't be hungry!Anyway I was fine the first day, but the morning of the second day I woke up about 5am feeling extremely ill. I proceeded to spend the next 5 hours throwing up /dry heaves and diarrhea. Needless to say I stopped taking it immediately.On a side note, I am a very healthy, 27 year old female with no medical problems whatsover. I don't recommend this product - if you try and get through it you are very lucky!"
3,Allergen Warning,"These products contain Wheat, Soy and Shellfish. I didn't see that posted on the product info page. I am not new to fasting, but haven't done one in 2 years and though I would try this product out. I suspected something was weird about it when i started itching everywhere, including inside my mouth and in ears. So I looked at the labels. It's really weird to me that they would include 3 of the most common allergens in a cleansing product. Major waste but I am going to have to stop taking them. Hope this review stops someone else with these allergies from purchasing this."
3,Quite a challenge,"I have to say I wasnt expecting to take about 20 pills for breakfast/lunch/dinner, thats the part that really got to me. There were WAY too many pills to consume. I can handle taking pills but 20 at a time is intense and kinda made me sick. I stuck to it for 3 1/2 days after that I couldnt do it anymore.On the positive side of this cleanse, I did lose 7lbs I wasnt hungry at all (well will all the pills you are taking and the large amount of water you consume...I felt full and sick) and even though I lasted 3 1/2 days, I have to say I have a lot more energy and not very hungry.Overall...if you can handle taking THAT many pills a day... do it totally worth it, Its not too bad. I just couldnt handle it."
4,Works good but tastes terrible,"This product definately works but the fiber fortification tastes quite gross. I had to plug my nose every time I had to take it. The first two days are the worst and then your body will get used to not eating. I never felt famished but it was nice to finnaly eat after the 5 days. I got quite a bit of ""alien"" looking gunk out so it does work but it's a process you have to suffer through to get to that point. If you can stick it out it will work but I'm talking a lot of will power. If I didn't do the program with my husband at the same time I would never had made it. Use the buddy system so there is less temptation to eat."
1,fasting kit,I took 2 doses of this kit and I started to get sick. I could not complete the 5 day series. My daughter took it at the same time and she got sick too after the first day. I would not recommend this product to anyone!!!
3,Makes sense...,"Seems like a great concept from the reviews that I read, however, once I received the package, you wonder whether someone can really fast for that long and only ""eat"" pills for 5 days. Think about that before you purchase it - since I have a spouse, it didn't make much sense to try to starve myself and cook for him. Otherwise, cost value, it's realy affordable for a 5 day cleanse that could do wonders for your body."
2,Loved the product but the price shot up,I loved this product. I took it for seven days and ate on them. I ate good foods like salads I did have some constipation problems but it cleared up in a day or so. I lost seven pounds. So when I came back to buy another round before my birthday to my surprise the price went up over $20.00 Such a shame I guess I will be looking for a new product.. I would have given it a 4. The size of the pills are HUGE! and you take 20 a day you are not suggested to eat at all on this plan but I did. And you have to drink fiber YUCK!!!!!! and I drink green drinks daily...
2,Warning: contains shellfish!,"Perhaps I did not read the ingredient list closely enough, but when I received this it said explicitly on the box that it contains shellfish (lobster, crab). I am vegan so this definitely will not work. Please disclose this on the product listing so that others do not have this same issue."
3,Seems to work..terrible side effects...,"I recently just purchased this product and was excited to try it - really just to lose weight and rid the body of toxins. I didnt lower my calorie intake prior to use and didnt have an issue with food cravings. However, by the end of the second day I was so completely nauseated i had to eat. During the 48 hours i did take this product I had terrible sinus problems and an extreme lack of focus. I could barely work my 9-5! The Fiber powder is the most disgusting thing ive ever tried (and i have a high tolerance). It turned the water into a thick ooze...noo way was i going to do that for the entire time. I ended up substituting the fiber with benefiber and that seemed to do fine. It is now the end of day 2 and I am about to stop simply because i am tired of feeling like i have the flu. I may go get some white castle!"
2,YUK,The shakes were ok. The Cleanse for Life & Snacks were awful. It's way overpriced. Lots of fancy literature that was unneccesary included.
3,What's Worth Fighting for in the Principalship?,"Book assists princpals on identifying the problems in the school community and how to decide if they are worth fighing for. Basically, it tells you to pick your battles because not all can be won. The book is easy to read and understand. The author cites examples and gives various solutions."
1,Better Salesman Than Researcher,This book will play well to people who buy anything with Fullan's name on it without wondering if there is any meat.
3,What's Worth Fighting for in the Principalship?,"The book was fairly easy to read. It had several excellent points, but seemed to be a bit redundant at times. It has easy to understand advice about the principalship. I enjoyed the quotes and would have liked for the book to elaborate more on some of them.It has a great deal of information that would be good discussion material in a group setting. It is easy to understand why it might be a part of a graduate curriculum."
5,LOVE this book & read this book will BUY this book & you too,This is excellent for book about planets and alians that come down to Starship Commanders in order to test humens on earth so watch out in skies for ships and visitors coming soon. clearly there is more to story that mister godbout tells so i hope movie or second book explains why the centurions play dice outside tomb and rocks were slippery.
5,very durable and fun for all,Have had this for over 6 months and the kids have thrown the darts everywhere including some on the dartboard. The darts are very durable and has very strong magnetic tips that really stick to the board. Highly recommended especially for young kids.
5,Topographical Take on Human Nature...,"As much as we all, American's and the entire world would like to believe that human nature is about viture and moral goodness. This life is very simple, acquiring wealth while avoiding the threat of violence from others; no wonder the world over loves FICTION. This book written by Avalos is not Fiction - far from ! this book places many unpleasant topics in a readable format for the left / right and middle of the road people. This book should be a must read as should be Machaevill's Price, Mostesquieu's, The Spirt of the Laws, Rousseau, Locke, Voltaire, Aristole's Nicomachean Ethics, Bacon's Essays, Nietzsche and Will Durant's the lessons of history and a few more books that place reason as sublime. best to you all in your studies !!!"
1,Holy Wars?,"Like most atheists, Dr. Avalos has an axe to grind and takes a typically myopic view of world history. The 2,000 years of religious violence comes nowhere close to the 51 million infants whose lives were snuffed out by post-Christian modernists; and, all that blood shed in far less than twenty centuries."
5,PAGE TURNER!!,"Love the characters in this series.... Archer Pierces' accident finally made him realize that God had a different calling for him other than being a pastor. Lauren panics when Dr. Grant Sheldon proposes, but needs to decide whether she can take care of two teenagers and give up her freedom... does she love Grant and the twins enough. Then Dr. Mitchell Caine adds even another tangle of mystery to the story. Engaging characters, action packed emergencies, and page turning disasters help make Urgent Care a fantastic adventure to escape to. Highly recommend it!!"
5,Urgent Care,Urgent Care is the final book in the Healing Touch Series. Hannah Alexander does it again in this series that touches the heart.
4,I WAS JUST AS SCARED AS YOU ARE NOW!,"I started out really freaked out, because i bought the brand new macbook unibody just released a last month and i blew a huge scratch on it already. It was DEEP, 4 scratches across the front. I worked slowly, and figured i did not get any result, so i rubbed harder. and rubbing harder worked!!!!!!!!!!!elbow grease really means pressure. you need lots of SLOW, HARD pressure to remove these scratches. I had a medium scratch on my laptop, but it really took full 18 hours of restoring to 100% manufacture state.the problem with the product is the solution is not enough to completely for a laptop. the application is really enough to remove the scratches, but not enough to remove the ones you created while you were trying to remove the original one. there arent tooo many of them, but they can appear, if you are not careful, so you would need additional solutions to fix thosse. see?so in all, its not a bad product, but the amount the give you is RIDICULOUS!"
4,"Time-consuming, but great results.","The directions could be a little clearer, but once you get past the learning curve, this product works well. In two hours time, it took out 4-5 scratches from my Sony Vaio VGN-UX380N screen and restored it to factory-polished condition!For my UX and for PDAs, the included Optex cloths don't allow you to apply sufficient pressure or control during the scratch removal process, but are excellent for final polishing. For scratch removal, the included cotton swabs, and even regular cotton swabs, seem to do much better. The cloths might work well for 15"" or larger LCD screens, but I haven't tried it yet with those.It seems to work well for acrylic touch screens like that of my UX."
1,Does not do the job!,"After several attempts all the scratches are still there, and there are some new ones. Don't expect the result to be as great as advertised. I don't recommend it to renew an Ipod, it did more damage than good."
1,It Doesn't Work,"It works a little bit on the shiny back of your iPod, but other than that it doesn't do much."
1,"Looks Cool, But Does Not Work Correctly","This was a rather ellaborate model to build and actually fun. However, it just did not work correctly - there is little room for error with this one. On first flight, the parachute did not deploy and the rocket crashed. I fixed it back up and launched again and it crashed again. Plus, the pods never deployed (and I had the tube lubed up with graphite). I was looking forward to this one, but it was a big disappointment."
2,"If it helps, I can't tell...",This blower unit seems to offer very minimal output. I cannot feel outward-rushing air when the unit is on. I believe the vertical airflow slots on the Comfort Glow heater are too small to allow any significant air output.
1,doesn't do anything...,"Installing this makes absolutely no difference at all. The heat doesn't blow out of the heater like you would expect. In fact, it doesn't blow at all. It seems like it cools the heat coming out and possibly deducts from the output. It sure makes a lot more noise, but no difference in the heat circulation. All of the heat goes straight up out of the heater whether the blower is ""working"" or not. It then continues to collect on the ceilings or the upstairs, just the same as it used to.I would not recommend buying this item - it is purely a waste of money. I would have been much better off by buying another natural gas heater."
4,Helps move the heat but is a little noisy.,"I bought this along with the Ready Heater 30,000 BTU heater. You have to be very careful to mount it properly, INSIDE the heater, to get it to work best. The thing that bothered me was that it is a little noisy. Not a rattle from loose mounting, but a hum from the motor vibration. That little fan just shouldn't make a noise. It's not bad but just more than I expected. Should be quiet."
2,Not worth the money,I Bought 2 of these. I installed one in the heater in our kitchen. Installation instructions are good but a little tricky to install. I was very dissapointed with the lack of air movement from this fan. Also it makes the whole heater rattle. My wife and kids are constantly hitting the top of heater trying to get it to stop rattling and making noise. I've yet to install fan in our other heater because it really does not not do much good.
2,underpowered,"helps some, but dosen't seem to move enough air to really make it effective as it should be."
1,Useless as sold -- requires other parts,"Be warned, this product is useless as sold. It does not include either the adapter that plugs into a phone OR the second part of the cord that plugs into the adapter. What they don't tell you anywhere is that it requires both of those components to operate. I'm returning mine."
4,Non-phony,"This head set and microphone works quite well. The head band needs to have more pressure. You need a place to hang up the head set. It is VERY convenient to have both hands free while talking on the phone. The added audio from two sources, is a boon for those of us with a hearing loss."
4,"Great directions, poor maps.","I've owned this book for a number of years, and have found it really helpful for finding prime birding locations in Ohio. It could stand a little updating, & the maps are not very useful, but the detailed directions of how to get to a location are really useful, when coupled with a DeLorme map for the state.Thomson's division of the state is also rather odd. There are locations that seem to be arbitrarily grouped into a geographic region that it doesn't seem appropriate to be in.Overall, it is very useful if you're going to be doing birding in the state and are either a new Ohio birder, or coming from out-of-state to do some birding."
2,Heats Up Fast But...,"I've enjoyed having this little microwave and it's been a fast heater upper. I do have a few issues with the product I wanted to bring to everyone attention, tho. It's painted inside with a cream colored paint that started coming off under the glass plate after a year of use. Maybe it's because my hubby likes to heat his sunflower seeds in the microwave and the plate gets very hot. I'm not sure. Next, just this past week the oven filled up with small, white, lightning bolts and scared me really good. I had to reach and push the release button to open the door not knowing if I would be knocked backwards or risk a fire. In all I believe the microwave gets to hot for the material quality it is made of. Just becareful with this little fellow and treat it with kid gloves. I hope my review helps someone."
1,"Good while it lasted, which wasn't long.","I'm not very fussy on products like a microwave as I am other tech products; as long as it can heat up a Hot Pocket and a bag of popcorn, I have no issues. I bought this microwave in store for $80 (approximate). I've had it for just over a year (of course, it is only has warranty for 1 yr.) and it just died. Can't find anything wrong, and the cost to have a repairman come look at it alone (forget any actual work or parts) isn't worth the money or my time. I'll save money by purchasing a new one (of another brand) instead.For those looking for a microwave and conducting their research on Amazon and online like I do, I would highly recommend to STAY AWAY from Emerson products, or at least this one."
3,"It lasted 3 years, the door do not open anymore","I little bit noisy after finishing any cooking but it was ok while it lasted. After 3 years just stopped with a cup of milk inside, and is not possible to open the door. Checked the manual, do not mention anything similar or related."
1,This microwave is dangerous,"I have owned two microwaves in my life: the one I had as a wedding gift that lasted for 8 years, and my Emerson which lasted for about 1. Pretty quickly, the paint on the inside of the microwave started chipping off, revealing rust. Last week, the microwave started smoking and sparking. At least my last microwave just died. When an Emerson goes, it tries to take your house down with it. The Macbeth of microwaves, it will not play the ""Roman fool,"" but will die lashing out at everything around it. Do not buy this product. Google their name."
2,OK for 2 years,"We've had this microwave for 2 years. It has recently started making faint crackling noises continually when plugged in - even when not running. This makes us nervous and we decided to replace it.Other observations:I never did figure out how to customize the time for amounts other than full minutes or half minutes.I was disappointed that the microwave did not have a kitchen timer. I really missed that feature.The paint/finish started peeling off the front surface under the turntable, where it meets/touches the bottom of the door.However, it heated food just fine. We like the 30 seconds button, and the fact that numbers up to 6 will start the oven running for that many minutes (5 = 5 minutes)."
2,"Died in 3 Years, also","This Microwave worked well for a very short time period. It never saw any excessive use, but only after 2 years the thing decided to short out and die. We got it fixed and it lasted a couple of months before doing it again. Not recommended."
3,Let's see...!,"Well, I must say I made this order(overseas) with Amazon, for family living overseas...and within 24hrs this was delivered-wow...great!! But now, the next thing, is to see how my family finds the use of this microwave...I do hope, that since those last four reviews, that there would have been improvement(it took quite sometime, for me to finally make the decision as to what would be IDEAL). So,for now, I give it a three star rating...until later."
3,"Interesting book, but too many errors","I worked as an engineer on the Gemini and Apollo projects, with McDonnell in St. Louis and at the Cape, working for Boeing on Apollos 8 through 13. Guenter's stories brought back many similar memories.I can personally attest to Guenter's reputation at the Cape as the ""Pad Fhrer""; nobody wanted to cross him! He was truly a legend in his own time.Unfortunately, my enjoyment of the book was hampered by many technical and historical errors. However, most readers will not be aware of these and will enjoy it."
3,Not enough Guenter,"""The Unbroken Chain"" is woefully lacking in the personal details that so many of the other first-hand accounts by Mercury/Gemini/Apollo chroniclers have included. There isn't enough in this book on Guenter's life before NASA to fill one page. I'm not looking for teary-eyed Nazi-confessions or anything, but what about his upbringing? What about his education? Yes, these questions could be answered briefly, but it's the details that round out the picture and tells us what motivates this man to be the model many people SHOULD strive to emulate. The personal anecdotes about many of the astronauts, especially the ones that pull no punches, are invaluable. They're delivered dryly however, and read as though they were dictated directly onto paper without the kind of illustration/color that puts the reader in the room with Guenter. The research falls a little short in a few areas, as there are a couple of ""I don't remember his name""-type stories. All in all, a minor distraction..."
3,a little bait and switch?,"I absolutely LOVE White Diamonds and have used it for years. I ordered it for myself for Christmas, but instead received something called Sparkling White Diamonds. This is NOT the same scent. The bottle looks the same except that it is a pale blue.The receipt said White Diamonds but the product inside the box wasn't what I ordered."
3,White Diamonds fragrance review,"I did not receive the fragrance I ordered. I ordered White Diamonds. Instead ofreceiving what I'd ordered, I received Sparkling White Diamonds. I was upset at receiving something I did not order. I read someone's review who had a similar experience and thought ""it won't happen to me"". But it did. The fragrance is ok and I kept it because I didn't want to be bothered with the return process. In the future, because of this experience, I may look into another fragrance supplier."
5,Sparkling White Diamonds,"It is my wife's favorite and the only place she can by it, is online. She is not an internet type of person either. I wish it was available in local stores. Thank you for stocking it. I will be future purchases of this product."
1,An Arrogant and Uninspired Book,As pompous and unimportant a book as you will ever come across. Kahn tortues his readers with his awkward and inelegant prose as well as his inane and frankly quite obvious analysis. He counts on the esoteric nature of his subject to befundle the reader in to buying his self made image of faux intelligence.
5,Creepy but good,"I don't normally go for black-and-white movies, but a librarian recommended this and I'm glad I ordered it. Like the other great classics, it's well written and acted."
1,What Ever Happened to Baby Jane,Didn't get to watch much of it as the VHS tape arrived defective. The tape was shipped back to the vendor. I am waiting for my refund.
1,FIVE STARS! Classic Horror!,"I love this film! It's one of the best from it's time. Bette Davis and Joan Crawford give excellent performances. You won't be able to shake this one after it's over, though."
1,"Ewww, I think I wanna vomit!","This movie might possibly be the worst ever film on the face of this world. I would advise everyone to save their money to buy something that you won't want to kill yourself over. Whatever Happened to Baby Jane is about to crazed sisters, one of whom is crippled, Blanch(Joan Crawford). Her sister Jane(Betty Davis) still thinks she is a beautiful child actor that wants all of the attention. When Jane's sister get all of the attention and trys to kill her you see she just gets more, and more crazy. As the movie progresses you get more, and more annoyed, one cannot even sleep during this movie just because of how irritated you get. Finally, at the end of the movie we find Jane and Blanch(near death now) on a beach. Jane wants some ice-cream so she gets it and leaves her sister to die starving and thirsty on the beach. Do yourself a favor, listen to me when i say this is the worst movie EVER!"
2,Not the Best,"I did not like this movie. The DVD is well made, but as I found this movie a waste of time to watch, I cannot recommend it."
5,"Oh no, they're mine...","This movie is the absolute dickens. Such a great example of early 60s horror and suspense. Jane Hudson is my role model, I would love to tie my sister up to a bed and feed her a rat. This movie is a total classic. Edwin Flagg is such a wonderful character, he find a much better love interest than Baby Jane, however. ""Here comes the superchief!"""
4,Great Movie-Baby Jane,"An outstanding movie, never get tired of watching this movie. Will be a great movie 50 years from now. Joan Crawford and Bettie Davis perfect together, wish they had got along and made more movies together. My favorite part of movie is the ending where Baby Jane is dancing for the crowd, shows how greatness can go to saddness."
2,Quite funny.,"I think this was trying to be scary but it wasn't at all. I found that this movie is best viewed as a dark comedy. The film opens years after a calamitous car accident leaves Blanche in a wheelchair, with no one to care for her except the increasingly insane and sadistic Jane and their servant, Norman. Trying to punish Blanche for her years of success, Jane tortures the housebound woman, slowly trying to starve her to death, all the while attempting to recapture the fame of her youth. This dark drama also stars Victor Buono as the hefty pianist who answers Jane's ad for an accompanist, hoping to milk some money off the demented old woman. I think it was trying to capitilize on the success of Psycho. Oh well get some bud together and enjoy this cooky comedy."
2,sympathy for women over 50...,"felt so bad that these wonderful beautiful talented actors had to resort to such drivel to make a sawbuck... at least Joan looked normal and aged well, Bette having to out ghoul the ghouls to illicit some scare tactics and rats n tweety bird for dinner just took the cake, and that dang song would not leave my head about that DaDDY!!! whose address is heaven above, well I wish that is were this film would go, the ending on the beach was unexpected but that ice cream looked good and back then they made it with the good stuff... Bette's daughter is abs gorgeous and expected to see more of her but after she witnessed this death march would expect she would steer clear, oh well, maybe a remake with Angelina Jolie and Jenn Aniston in 2025 is something to look forward to!! ;}}"
2,Not scary,"It must have been scary at one time, but now it's just sad and the characters seem foolish. Of coure, that was in a day when women had feewer choices and decisions were made less on the basis of pragmatism than other reasons."
4,Betty Grable and Ginger Rogers,oh well it could have been betty and gingerboth blonde both musical stars (grable was more popular)
5,"The BEST of entertainment, that's Baby Jane!!","I can watch Baby Jane over and over and never get sick of it. The insanity, jealousy, entrapment by an insane sister, it's just fabulous! You'll find no sex, no swearing, no nudity, just a total fantastic thriller of a movie. Hollywood ought to get their acts together and go back in time and start making movies like they used to. I'm not an older person either and I love this movie! It goes to show you that Hollywood is run by a bunch of dumb bell producers that could really take lessons on true entertainment from back when."
5,Never thought this would happen...,"I have not bought a Blu-Ray player yet, but I need to now. ""What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?"" is my all-time favorite film! I never thought it would see the light of day in an anniversary release, let alone Blu-Ray! That being said, I do not like the cover art. It's nothing but a tacky photoshop job. It would look so much better (considering it's the 50th anniversary release) with the original movie poster artwork...I hope Warner Bros. fixes this before October!"
5,First time seeing this,"Oh my god, this is now one of my favorite movies. The ending totally shocked me!I rented this movie but am now going to buy it. The character and plot line has me hooked. Why, why didn't I watch this sooner.Great plus is that the film lacks any grain which I often see in older movies. So good."
5,What Ever Happened to Baby Jane,DVD arrived early and the didn't expect the extra footage/DVD included in package. What a great suprise. Recommended for any Bette Davis and Joan Crawford fans. And recommned for anyone who loves great acting.
4,Bette Davis and Joan Crawford.....,"The fact that these two women starred together in a film is enough reason to watch. These were two of the most celebrated and self career controlled actresses of the era. This movie is quite enthralling, and has a surprising twist at the end. It is worth the time to watch."
5,Exellent!!,This is an old great movie...Love Betty Davis and Joan Crawford together.....Saw it once years ago...It's just as good as it always was.....When i order a movie i always go through Amazon...Their the best!!...Thanks Amazon.com
4,what ever happened to baby jane?,"I remember seeing this movie a long time ago, I recall that bette davis and joan crawford didn't like each other in real life. In the back in DVD case it said ""black comedy"" For those who have not seen this film before it is not a ""black comedy"" some scenes have suspense, violence, and some funny scenes. The guy that bette davis' character like so much found out how crazy she was when he found her sister tied up and gagged in the bedroom and he was drunk but he sure got out of that house real quick. (LOL). I'm not to give too much away that just a preview what I've just given. I give it four stars."
5,What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?,"This is an oldie, but well worth buying and watching.The movie is a classic!I loved this movie from the first time I seen it."
3,Decent TV-remake of a camp classic,"This was a 1991 made-for-tv remake of the classic Whatever Happened to Baby Jane starring Bette Davis and Joan Crawford. Obviously someone realized how popular it was and what a strong fan following it had and so they finally decided to release this one to the public and I'm glad they did! While most originals are always the best, this one is definitely worth watching if you don't sit through the entire movie constantly comparing it to the original. I enjoyed both, this one just has a more modern touch to it. Lynn and Vanessa Redgrave are terrific actors so they make this film their own here. I give the original 5 stars and this one 4 stars! Check it out!"
4,Come back Baby Jane,"An old friend of mine requested the movie ""Whatever Happened to Baby Jane"" starring Betty Davis and Joan Crawford. She had not seen it since it first opened. Although very scary she said she enjoyed seeing it again very much. Betty Davis was frighteningly effective ,as the much older Baby Jane, harassing her older sister played by Joan Crawford to the point of being sadistic.Palmer"
4,I've written a letter to Daddy................,"Oh the humanity! What a great flick! I put it on when I want to clear the room! Bette Davis ruled this one. She so's horribly ugly you can't take your eyes off her! This film is as predictable as grass growing during a Florida summer, but it's oh so fun. Watching Joan Crawford being kicked and beaten by an insane Baby Jane can never get old. What does one do when your cutoff by the liquor store? Call them up and use your sister's voice of course! What do you do when you have a symphathtic housemaid? Bash her! After killing, maiming, and continued lunacy what do you do? Take your crippled, half dead sister to a crowded beach in the middle of the day! And once you finally discover the topsy-turvy ending? Sing and dance in front of the cops as they lead you away! Dance and sing on Baby Jane, God bless you."
3,Macabre,Psychological thriller starring Bette Davis. An agung child star wages terror over her sister. nominated for 5 Academy Awards.
3,MOMENTS OF BRILLIANCE,"This collection of Dr Hook's hits is always interesting and does contain a few gems, like the sublime Sylvia's Mother, a series of telephone conversations between a jilted lover and his unfaithful girlfriends mom, with a lovely melody and soulful vocals. There's also the ironic Cover Of The Rolling Stone (I'm not sure the band ever made it there?) and a couple of other memorable tunes, like Makin' It Natural and Life Ain't Easy. They never made rock history, but Dr. Hook & The Medicine Show's small contribution to 1970s rock will be cherished by the nostalgists among us, if only for Sylvia's Mother."
5,Still One of the Best Live Albums Around,"The recent addition to the Manilow collection, a remastered version of the Live album originally released in the 70's, is a welcomed and recent purchase. I admit that I originally had this album, yes...""album"", and really wore it out from playing it so much.Barry is at his best with his original back-up singers Lady Flash. You can hear the enthusiasm and just pure joy that they all have by performimg live. I have seen Barry perform live many, many times. Although he is still the ultimate entertainer, he really shined during those years, especially when we were in the midst of the ""Disco"" era.The fun of the original album is still here including the now dated ""VSM"", and most of us who have been his fans for years still enjoy his former commercial jingle medley. The additional tracks restored make this a CD to have in your collection. It is like having an old friend return after many years. You wonder why you were ever apart."
4,Pretty good considering what's missing,"There is good and bad with this album. That having been said, if you're a Manilow fan then you should like this CD.The bad is that this CD is missing some of Barry's bigger hits (most notably, Copacabana). That can't be helped, since this concert was before he even recorded or released the song.On the other hand, the selections that are here are what you would expect from Barry - given what he ahd done up until that point - and they are well done. What I especially like is that this CD gives you the good live version of Daybreak. The live versions of his other standards (It's a Miracle, New York City Rhythm) are good and some of the other selections (VSM) definiately make this CD worth the money."
5,Tasty...,"I was wanting to try parched corn to see if I liked it, before thinking about trying to make my own. Commercial parched corn seems VERY hard to come by, this was actually all I was able to find. One might have more luck hitting up small local stores, maybe.At any rate, I did very much enjoy this product. I was worried it would be very hard, but it isn't. Has a very nice flavor. I have to disagree with an earlier reviewer who complained that it dried his mouth out badly. It's no worse than any other salty snack I've had in that regard. Though I know it'd be more economical to make my own, I think the price is good enough that I'd buy again (considering shipping is included). Especially given that my attempt at it will likely not be as good as this."
1,Parched indeed -- and hard,"This gritty parched blue corn snack will leave your mouth parched afterwards and begging for a drink. To me this snack ate like really tough, dense Corn Pops cereal. I'll see if my rabbit wants it."
5,Highly Recommended Arthur Tracy Reissue,"Speak to Me of Love is one of the better Arthur Tracy titles, this one from 1996. The transfers are very clear and rich. When you listen closely you begin to appreciate how expressive a ballad singer he was - ideally suited to the sentimental songs that were popular during his most active years. He also sang current pop tunes as shown on the track list. In lesser hands, some of these songs would sound laughable. But Arthur Tracy puts them all across with sincerity and feeling, and makes you believe in them.Mr. Frank Wappat performed the very nice transfers for this CD and also for an earlier Arthur Tracy reissue, ""The Sweetest Song in the World,"" on the Conifer label. There is no duplication of tunes on the two CDs, save for `Marta,' which apparently is obligatory for all Arthur Tracy reissues.Note: the product code that is linked to this Amazon.com listing is incorrect. The actual UPC from the CD jewel case is 5012498051728."
2,eh...,"The CD musicianship is great (as the other person said) but they are way to proud of themselves. The lyrics seem amateur and lack real focus. Seems like a bunch of metaphores without any real focus.The vocalist is hard to understand. The song ""Sameness"" is a lot of muttering without much sense. If they had better lyrics and a better vocalist (and weren't so serious) they would rock. The music itself is great.All in all, It seems like they are a bunch of college kids who put some money in and made an album. Potential is there, but most bands have potential. There's nothing that seperates this band from all the rest of the mainstream."
2,Derivative,"Rock with no balls. It's a hybrid of Creed and Live without the necessary guts or sheer power which make the other bands at least tolerable. The lyrics are banal and vague, imitative and uncourageous. The singer needs desperately to find his own voice and the whole outfit seems to take themselves FAR TOO SERIOUSLY. The musicianship is actually rather competent, bordering on fine - but so MANY bands have TALENT, that all it comes down to really is TASTE, and this band needs a serious dose. Perhaps if they could expand their musical library and pull from influences of a greater range (something a bit more expansive than the Black/Counting Crows and Pearl Jam) they'd be in a better position to create original stuff. But right now they seem content to be like everything else represented in this all too bloated market.'Course, that's just my opinion..."
1,"The pictures were scary, the book was itty bitty, pages were torn",There were two pages that were torn.The pictures were scary and on onepage the eyes were colored in. I didnot even show this to my grandsonI threw it away.
4,Versaware Crockpot,I brought this one and it truly is great. The only drawback is DON'T BREAK THE LID. Rival does not sell a lid replacement and mine has broke through no fault of the manufacturer; they told me to simply use aluminum foil to secure cover to cook! Bummer!
5,Fighting Cancer With the Help of Your Catholic Faith,"Having cancer myself, I found this to be a very enlightening and comforting book. I have given this book to several friends who have cancer.Bob D."
5,great switch,this switch is great it is on my outside forced air furnace it kicks the blowerfan on at exacly 119 degrees and off at execly ninty deg great product will bye again
5,Met my needs,Did the function that I was looking to perform so to that end it met my needs and did it job.
1,Roman History Lite,"Considering the author did such a good job with the American Revolution in ""Patriots,"" this book was a big disappointment.It lacks depth and is riddled with errors, e.g.,Cicero gave a great speech in defense of Milo; Crassus described as a ""rich merchant"". I was really annoyed with the author's use of the term ""patrician"" when the more correct term would be ""Optimate"" (hint: not all nobles were patricians)."
5,SVG for non-geeks and ordinary people!,Finally here's a book that addresses the needs of illustrators and visual designers in addition to programmers! Teague and Campbell show how to easily create SVG graphics using vector editing tools like Adobe Illustrator. SVG is the future for those who are serious about delivering graphics over the Web--especially delivery of technical illustrations. This book shows how to get there today.
1,This is not SVG,I am on chapter 4 of this book and am waiting for anything coherent about SVG. It is more like a badly written Illustrator tutorial.
2,no go,I returned this product. It was plastic and cheap looking; make large holes in my windowsill; was unstable; and my cats would not use it.
4,Alan's third book and third best,"Alan has a wonderful gift for expressing his expeditions and emotional journeys on paper. He can set you in the middle of his trails and make you feel his inner turmoils and exhilerations. Although Jaguar was by far his best book, this one should not be missed. I will be anxiouxly awaiting his next journey and book."
4,A good book,"This was a good book, I think Jaguar was his best book but I liked this one. It must have been amazing to have trekked across such unknown wilderness and interact with the local villagers and see a part of the world that virtually no western eyes have seen. It must have been extremely difficult to deal with the reality of overexploitation of wildlife to trade for something as mundane as salt. Rabinowitz doesn't paint the local people as uncaring monsters. They are just trying to make a life for themselves and their families.I would have like a few photographs of the animals, but this isn't a field guide. Overall the book was very good. I liked the way the Dr. Rabinowitz made the point that if any conservation effort is going to have even the smallest chance of being successful the local government and more importantly the local people need to be involved from day one."
3,Trans-Girl 101,"Lenore, Annabelle and Jennifer Ann are bestfriends they are family to one another. They understand the rejection from society and yearning to be ""the other women""Pamela Hayes writes heartfelt novels about the Trans Community. Which does not mean others will not enjoy it, just her theme is gender specific.The Other Women tells the story of three wonderfully delightful transexuals who could very well be your bestfriend or next door neighbor. I felt as though ""The Other Women"" was a inside look of the experiences from transitioning to living as The Other Women.At some points while reading the Other Women, it seemed as if I was reading Ms. Hayes story, which I truly enjoyed either way."
1,Boring!,"I picked this book up on a whim and thought that it couldn't be too bad. Well was I mistaken. The plot was pretty thin and not the least bit scary. I mean I thought giant spiders would have scared the pants off me but in this story, nothing. If you are looking for something scary, don't bother with this one."
3,I know why makeup artists go for the drugstore stuff!,"How many times have I heard that professional make-up artists prefer the drugstore brand of mascara, Maybelline? Enough that I finally bought some quite a while back! I didn't buy their recommended formulation but I really did like the one I bought (Falsies Flared) and have bought it more than once. I also love Lancome's Definicils-probably number one in my book but not affordable. Just like the Chanel mascara. I decided to splurge and bought the Chanel at a ""somewhat"" affordable price and really, it was good but not THAT good. In other words, I'm not raving about it and will more than likely never buy it again. For that kind of money, Lancome has my vote but for practicality, I'm getting a new tube of Maybelline..."
4,Left an Impression,"The first time I read this book, it really seemed suspensful. Carole really gets upset about some nightmares that she's been having. Some of the stories that this new stablehand, Troy, told were really good. I really got involved while I was reading, and got kind of scared/startled at some points. The next time I read it, it didn't seem quite as impressive, but it was still a good book. I highly recommend it!"
5,Another Classic from the British Rockers,"I got this album on CD recently, when I decided that my turntable needs to be retired. Definitely one of the best Budgie albums from the ""middle"" period, good rockers and ballads which have not really aged much in 25 years or so. Given the outrageously short playing time, I would like to have got it on one CD combined with the equally good Impeckable. Budgie never really made it big in UK, although they were deservedly appreciated in Europe. Does that prove something?"
4,Budgie Waives The Bloody Rules!!!!,"Though not as consistent as most of the albums from their ""classic"" period with Tony Bourge on guitar, I can't rate any Budgie with Bourge lower than 4 stars. The title cut is the standout with more tricky changes in rhythm and feel than you can shake a stick at.A few things like ""Anne Neggen"" the opener are a little average for Budgie.""Sky High Percentage"" and ""Black Velvet Stallion"" are fine heavy moments.It looks like most of the reviews on this page (including another one of mine)are actually for the Impeckable album and listed with the wrong record."
1,Don't Bother,"This is a silly, shallow story with LOUSY artwork. It did not hold my child's attention at all--or mine. I love good children's books, and this one was a waste of my time and money. Save yours!"
1,no time to mess with,"System did not boot, used various working CPU's / RAM .... Never booted past POST.did not have enough time to do more than about an hours worth of troubleshooting on it.Threw it on the junk pile, where it remains. 200 Bux cost not worth fighting with/over.needed a new MB with 64 bit pci this had it, but .....Bought a new Supermicro from manufacturer, no probs.Should, woulda, coulda...."
4,Exceptional example of Croatian haiku poetry,"This is one of the best books of haiku poetry in Croatia, which is the leading European country in the field. Many Croatian haiku poets were rewarded in Japan and one of the founders of haiku movement among Croatians is Marijan Cekolj, the author of this book. If you wanna see the proof that haiku doesn't work only for Japanese people, read it.Somewhat specific, this work of Cekolj, who published some other books of poetry, deals with Nature and is closest to traditional Japanese principles. The same author publishes the only international Croatian magazine for haiku poetry ( Croatian/English ), ""Sparrow"", whcih is well known in 22 countries. Ing. Drago Plecko, M.Sci."
1,BEWARE: This is a very abrevited/butchered/anglosized version!,"I was shocked when I received the Penguin-version: It contained 51 pages, when the original is 224 pages! It takes place in England!!!I had ordered this book for my grand-daughter, as I am a Berliner and wanted her to discover a part of her literary heritage, but this version is ""RETOLD"" and has absolutely nothing in common with the original! Don't buy it. Instead consider the Hard-cover version, that will be released in April 2006.I wish that Amazon.com would have taken the time to point out these facts under the descriptions."
5,Children's Classic,"I first read this book as a child, and loved it then. Decades later, I found an ancient copy in my library's annual sale of books they no longer wanted to keep. As an adult, I like it still. The story moves quickly, the characters are engaging, and there's a flavor of Berlin at a more innocent time in the 1920s. Emil takes a train trip to visit relatives in Berlin. When the money he is carrying is stolen, he resolves to catch the thief."
5,great amp for the pric,"i bought this amp because it was cheap. people were telling me to avoid sony for an amp and i did some research on the specs and bought it anyway for my 15"" ported Kicker L7. this amp provides more than enough juice for my sub and it slaps real hard. they ask what amp i got, and i tell them i got a sony and they give me this look like ""a sony....weak"" then i turn up the music and all doubts are drowned by the super bass from my L7."
3,Politics as Usual,"Oh how frustrating it is reading the morning newspaper and seeing the latest sordid scandal. Yet during the days of our Founding Fathers such things were also common place. So goes the plot of this novel where young American Jeremy Brett of Portsmouth New Hampshire finds himself beached and penniless in pre revoutionary war London and about to set off on a journey one might see portrayed in Hogarth's various prints.Overall, I really don't go for this sordid stuff. I really didn't care much for the illustrations which really are not necessary for an adult's book. I really didn't care much for the people in this story. Maybe I am old fashioned and fond of the moral values but I do wish Mason had done this a bit different.Certainly the ending could have been done a bit different and a bit better."
1,Worthless piece of literature!,"This book is truly an example of an over-priced piece of poor quality garbage. The figures look like they have been photo copied, many of the equations and word lines look like a botch job due to poor software during the writing/printing process, and most importantly the method of relaying or teaching the information is very sub-par. I would highly encourage anyone considering buying this book to NOT do so."
1,Disappointing from such a famous physist,"The introduction is laughably brief and uninformative, the middle sections(the core of the material) is glossed over with 2-3 equations and a diagram each or is a mess of mathematical equations. I never got to the ending since I found a book by Gerald Burns--an awesome book which I highly recommend. I was lucky my professor was good at teaching solid state. Also he did recommend this book, but I got a STRONG feeling it was half-hearted (besides the core of the material he taught about solid sate was not in the book or was covered briefly."
1,Terrible Text,"This is by far the most difficult to follow textbook I have used in my college career. Not only is the content harder than it needs to be, but the structure of the text book is cumbersome and the aesthetic qualities of the chapters are poor to the point of confusing the reader. LaTeX would do this text wonders (the author uses a ""period"" to represent a dot product). Some of the figures are pixilated as if they were just copy-pasted into the text file. But even if you ignore the poor quality of the appearance of the book, it is still poorly written.If you are a professor considering using this text: DON'T USE IT! I would suggest ""Introduction to Solid State Physics"" by Charles Kittel if the class is expected to have seen some E&M; and Quantum topics before. If the class is less advanced perhaps you should use chapters out of ""Solid State Electronic Devices"" by Ben Streetman to supplement Kittel."
3,Fascinating but poor video quality/edit,"The video footage on this DVD is fascinating, but the quality of the video conversion (or original recording?) is poor, and the movies seem to have been edited choppily from perhaps a much longer film. Worth watching though, as the video footage is unique."
3,Remixed Disappointment,"I bought this CD just for the original ""Friday on My Mind"" track, and was very disappointed to hear that the song, while sounding much like the original 1967 version, was a remix with the lead singer given an echo effect. It's still superior to any of the versions I was able to find for the iPod, but I guess I'll keep looking."
2,Rip-off; no truth in advertising,"This CD purports to be a ""remastered and expanded"" version of the Easybeats' ""Friday on My Mind."" And it is...to a degree. See, Repertoire released this same exact disc in 1994; the only difference between this version and the 1994 version is some additional processing and some ""single versions"" of some tracks. As many of those single versions were hitherto unavailable on shiny disc, I foolishly plunked down the cash for this upgrade....and felt, well, somewhat let down. The ""single mixes"" are forgeries, created by simply folding the stereo programme down to mono. I cannot fathom why Repertoire felt compelled to do this...especially as the real mono mix of the title track is so widely available on CD.So yeah. Get the cheaper, better-sounding 1994 edition instead of this one. You'll be glad you did."
4,If you don't have a professional coach then try this,"If you've ever wanted to teach yourself to recognize particular notes and patterns this book is an excellent resource. The authors examine things like the major and minor scales, fifths, sevenths, melodies, sightsinging, triads, and diatonic progressions. They also do an excellent job of describing what is happening, the theory behind it and how to use it to help train your ears to recognize the notes, progressions, etc. The book includes exercises, answer sheets, and two CDs with examples of the various notes and tones from the book so you can practice. If you are serious about ear training you can't go wrong with Ear Training For the Contemporary Musician."
5,"Husbands, buy this for your wife!","I, being a guy, have never read this book. I'm writing a review because of what I've seen in my wife since she's read Marla's book. I have seen my wife grow in her confidence in herself. She is able to believe that we will be able to work things out during hard days. She is also able to keep perspective on how things aren't always perfect.Guys, do yourself a favor and buy your wife (or fiancee) this book!"
3,Good book....but a little skewed,"I think that many of the principles of this book are valid and will lead you to a happier marriage. I especially like comments like, ""this is what seperates the women from the girls"" and how she takes a no nonsense approach to the union. It is VERY Dr. Laura-esqe."
5,great polish for copper,I use this polish to clean my copper sink. it is the only thing that works. i would definitely recommend this product for cleaning copper.
5,polishing 1940's door knobs,This stuff worked great with a set of dremel polishing attachments. Make sure you dont use a lot at a time but keep adding more every minute in order to remove the grime.
2,Not as effective as Mother's,I bought both Simichrome and Mother's Chrome & Mag Polish. Mother's was much more effective at removing the stains and tarnish from my metals.
4,Simichrome,"As a metal artist, I've tried many products on the market for polishing metal. I find Simichrome and MAAS metal polish to be some of the best. It will even polish lucite or plexiglas, since I make brass salad servers with Lucite handles, and the metal polish is the only thing that gets both materials nicely polished. I find tarnish to be less a problem and the metal retains it's showroom finish longer, which is a plus when I do trade shows. Yes, there is a lot of elbow grease required to get a nice finish, but handpolishing metal on a buffing machine also takes a long time. I find the metal polish to work well on the areas I couldn't mechanically buff smooth. Metal in general is always going to require cleaning and polishing to keep it's luster and I'm thoroughly sick of working in copper now."
5,Ultimate Metal Cleaner,I just picked up a 2007 Ducati Monster with an open clutch (and rusty springs). I used this metal cleaner to polish the clutch after I removed the springs (see my reviews if you want a good set of replacement clutch springs). The rusty yellowish color came right off and the clutch looks gorgeous now. I also polished the rest of the metal on the bike including removing black exhaust residue from the Termignonis!I recommend this polish/cleaner.
2,Loop N Loom,Bought for my grandduaghter and she loves it - hardly put it down - I had bought an extra pkg of the loops so she wouldn't run out. Making great designs & colors. BUT the draw back - you cannot use. Did not realize this until it melted onto an oven shelf. And I mean really melted - must be plastic. Wish someone would offer cotton loops so the item would be useable. Be careful - they MELT!!
5,ALEX makes a great product,"We have several plastic looms made by other companies, but Alex's products are always top quality. They are more expensive, but worth it in my opinion. These loops are tighter and more colorful than other brands we have used. Nice gift!"
4,Nice toy.,I remember my loom and my son's loom and bought this for my 7 year old Grandaughter along with the refills.She loved it and eagerly started to make things with her loom.My comment on this is the cost is on the hi side.Chris G.
3,a bit disappointed,"My 5yr old grand-daughter was very proud to make her first potholder, and with time she will be able to do it by herself. After much research, I purchased this one. I was expecting a metal loom (today's description says ""plastic"" - read older comments, they got metal). And the included crochet hook needs to be 3 inches longer (we made our own tool using a coathanger). Still a fun toy, but doubt the plastic loom will last for the 2nd child."
4,"Love it, but...","My 5yo that I got it for absolutely loves this! And so does her 7yo brother! They aren't able to finish off the potholders yet, as they don't have the dexterity for that. There are two down sides to this Alex Loop and Loom.1) It just doesn't have enough loops, so I'll have to buy new loops. She's only on her third potholder. The first was pink and dark blue, and the second was yellow and light blue. After just that, she's already almost out of the blues and yellows, but seems to have a lot more of the pinks left. I wish this had come with a lot more loops!2) These potholders are not heat resistant. You can use them for decoration, to go with other toy kitchen accessories, or to make the really cute crafts pictured on the box. I will definitely make sure that the next batch of loops I get is heat resistant. Searching for the best deal on cotton loops."
3,Too expensive for what you get,"You can get same product for 25% of the cost of this one, and a better hook is included! Great toy for building fine motor skills for both boys and girls, so I still recommend you get someone's version of this toy and let your little ones create something useable (within heat limits mentioned elsewhere in comments)."
5,One of my favorites,My husband and I have the 1970s version of Pirateer and brought it to my parent's house for gamenight. My brother fell in love with the game and requested we bring it everytime we came over. I finally found a copy gave it to him for his birthday. He tells me he plays it almost everyday. We are so glad we found it. Its easy to learn and really fun to play. I have to agree with my brother. Its the best game ever.
2,too short needs an extension to reach battery terminals,too short to reach battery terminals when getting a boost. have to get an adapter that's even more money.thought it was longer .
1,Thanks for the warning guys! Don't get this!,I DID NOT purchase this because of the prior reviews of poor quality of this unit by you nice folks. I noted that it was said it only has only one cheap spring-like tension clip that is supposed to hold it in the outlet.I purchased the Solar ESA1 instead. It has two heavy duty tension peices.
1,crap,broke within 2 days had to take it apart and fix it the metal tip got stuck there is no spring inside just a bent piece fo metal pushing it out crap crap crap
2,poorly made,"When I first used, one of the terminal pins stuck inside the housing. I took it apart, the copper spring band had to be stretched out and I needed to resolder the cord to it before reclosing. Cheaply made, the pin still does'nt have much flex tension."
2,Works...but...,"First, this item works. However, it has two drawbacks when using it for a small air compressor. The chord is short which makes it difficult to reach tires. Also, the male connectors do not make for a tight connection and tend to vibrate loose so I have to hold the end. It's OK for occasional use."
4,Morse is amazing!,"This is the third book in the Soulwind series by master illustrator Scott Morse.In this volume, we again find ourselves with Nick, our protagonist with the Soulwind sword.Morse's art is just phenomenal, especially his calligraphy style. He is, without hyperbole, one of the greatest artists working in the medium.Each volume can be read independently, but all five are great!"
5,Live & Let Live,This is a great book.Everyone should read this book.They will learn a lot from it.I will give this book to everyone I know.Thanks for every one who made this book happened.barb
5,A small city's courage and decency,"I don't generally review children's books but, I bought this for my niece and read it. I was touched by this heartwarming tale. This is a true story of the people of Billings, Montana who stood up against hatred when anti semitic skinheads through rocks through the windows of Jewish homes displaying Hanukkah menorahs. The good people of this city got together and displayed menorahs also. Since there were not enough menorahs avilable, many displayed pictures of menorahs.This charming account is told from the point of view of a young boy whose window was smashed. Seeing the events unfurl from his eyes and the eyes of his parents truly humanized the account of events. It is written to read like a fictional story even though, for the most part, the events are true. This book is worth reading by the whole family, Jewish and non Jewish alike. All kids, even good readers, are entitled to be read to occasionally and this book should be read by the family together."
4,More than charming,This is a very important book - written for children yet making the story accessible to many adults too. Would that all adults could set the example of the adults in this story.
5,An important true story,"Our kids have turned this into a play, which they have enacted the past three years at Chanukah. It's an important about tolerance fighting hate.This is an important story for Jewish and non-Jewish children."
4,Useful reference for practitioners,"This is an ""old"" book (1987) but the only one I found so far that addresses cost estimation in real world situations, conceptually. It presents techniques and examples not only for new development but also for maintenance and modification of systems, which usually are lacking in other texts. The focus is in application, not in model development, and models used are those available at the time. The theory and models are better learned somewhere else because the presentation is VERY compact, hard to follow.I used this book as a text in a course I taught 10 years ago in a professional master's program and it was a success with students. It would be very useful to have a new edition, updated with the current models and tools. Editors, give this author a chance if he is still around."
4,Perfect Christmas gift,Was not as long as I thought it would be...but i also did not read the size....but was very good condition and very nice
1,Not a good buy,"I have never had much success with this lens, it will either back focus or hunts and hunts and then when it locks in the subject it is blurred and out of focus. At first I thought it was something I was doing wrong, but after many attempts to use it, I can't afford the risk of it not focusing as fast and accurately as I need it. I have kept in my bag, but now I need this lens and hope to get it fixed if at all possible while it is still under warranty. I would not recommend this to a friend, I would not purchase this lens again."
4,Is this book really talking about his TRUNK???,"I am not sure what to make of the book... the little boy wants a bigger you-know-what... TRUNK, but this books reminds me of the references to natural male enhancement that litter TV and email junk mail ads. Is there a bigger message? The mom has a beauty mark and wears too much make-up... when Otto complains he is too ""teeny weenie"" and says he wants one as big as daddy, the mom holds her hooves over her eyes and says ""No, No, No!!!"" Am I misinterpreting???"
3,beauty over function,"This is a sweet looking light, but it's VERY dim. It's more of a fashion accessory than a safety add-on. Know that going in and you'll be very happy with it."
4,Music Machine - '(Turn On) The Music Machine' (Repertoire),"Very good debut lp on CD reissue of the 1966 release of this short-lived garage rock band. Vocalist / guitarist Sean Bonniwell seems to be Music Machine's focal point. This twelve track disc might've been EVEN better, had it featured more of Machine's originals, like the smash hit single ""Talk Talk"", ""Trouble"" and ""Some Other Drum"". Their original material that I've even heard on another CD of theirs, 'Beyond The Garage' (see my review) was pretty decent. Covers here are nice, though like the Beatle's ""Taxman"", Neil Diamond's ""Cherry Cherry"" and ? And The Mysterian's ""96 Tears"". A should-have."
3,"Excelentes originales, innecesarios covers","The Music Machine es uno de los buenos grupos garajeros del 66' con todos los ingredientes necesarios (impecable voz, guitarra y órgano) y su disco debut contiene notables temas como Talk Talk, Trouble y Wrong. Sin embargo hay demasiados covers y aunque todos ellos son correctos vale la pena preguntarse por que un grupo capaz de hacer buenos originales tome prestados temas como Taxman, 96 tears, See see rider o Hey Joe. Al menos pudieron haber escogido algo menos conocido"
1,Harnesses are dangerous for guinea pigs,"For those of you who mention that your guinea pigs wriggle around in these and can't get out - they're wriggling because guinea pigs' spines are not meant to bend in the way a harness requires them to walk, and they're in discomfort or pain.Make a large, safe enclosure in which your guinea pig can safely exercise. Do not use a harness. If you want a pet to walk with a harness, get a dog."
2,Don't expect it to stay on a rat.,"Though the packaging depicts a rat fitting snugly in this small-sized version of the comfort harness, even the largest and fattest of my four rats managed to deftly wriggle her way out of it in a matter of minutes. This item might be suitable for an exceptionally large male rat, but be aware that for your typical, adult, well-fed fancy rat, it will prove essentially useless."
2,Comfort Harness Stretchy Leash - Large,"Very cheap material used for both the harness and the lead. Appears to be hand-sewn rather than factory made. Highly overpriced for relatively low quality. Velcro was not heavy-duty, but rather light-duty. Animal easily pulled Velcro apart and slipped out of harness. Thankfully we were still inside at the time."
1,Terrible for Guinea Pigs,"I didn't know much about guinea pigs when I bought this harness, apparently it is dangerous for them to wear. My guinea pigs both hate the harness and I have never been able to successfully get it on them, even though they are quite gentle. Their legs easily get caught on it and they just walk out of it. Waste of money."
1,Terrible for rats.,My boyfriend and I bought this yesterday... It was terrible.First off its impossible to get on the calmest of our rats. Then finally when you get it on they cant walk correctly and they stumble around as if they were wasted. Then finally they wiggle out 5 seconds after you spend 20 mins trying to put it on them!
2,"Cute looking, but didn't stay on my piggie!","I bought this harness for my little piggie and he is pretty big. When i recieved this harness i thought it wouldn't fit him but as i put it on him he quickly riggled out of it. i tried to train him by keeping it on him for a little bit but he would bite at it and riggle out. Do NOT buy this item, a big waste of my money."
4,pleased,it works so well that it is veartuly immpossable to get my guenny out of it! (he doesent want to come out)
3,Tight fit,I got a small for a guniea pig and it was tight around the neck he looked so uncomfortable. The plastic snaps came off. It was easily repaired. The product works for me because it is used lightly.
1,Comes Apart and Doesn't Fit Mini Lop,"The first time I took my rabbit out with this harness, the small hook connecting the leash to the harness came off. Luckily, my rabbit sat still long enough for me reach her again. Also, the little buckles slide off easily. In addition, the holes for head and stomach, though adjustable, don't fit a mini lop rabbit."
4,hmmm,"The G-pig had to grow to 4 months before it fit him at all. He can still get out of it if I do not keep an eye on him. Why can't we specify color? Quality is acceptable, especially for the price."
5,great harness,"I really liked this harness because is comfortable and my bunny doesn't want to get out of it immediately. The small size is really for small skinny animals, so if you are planning on use it in a bunny make sure you buy a medium or large."
1,Not a ferret,"Just fyi, this is not a ferret in the picture. It is a guinea pig. Guinea pigs are not dogs to be walked. Harnesses can harm guinea pigs!!"
2,Rabbit chewed through it,"Sigh...I had high hopes for this, but the first night I brought it home my rabbit chewed through the mesh neck in a matter of minutes. I suppose it ought to be made out of something sturdier than mesh."
1,no bueno,when i got it i had to put it on tight ware it was almost to tight than he sliped out i do not recomend this what so over buy a leash on another website
3,leash,"I haven't gotten the pet yet, but will mention that I'd assumed from the one pictured that the leash color would match the harness. I received a blue harness with black trim, but the leash is pure black."
2,Doesn't suit a hamster,"The leash is too large for a hamster, even a big one. My hamster just wriggled out of it..."
3,Wish you could choose the color....,"Got this for my son's guinea pig. It's cute but doesn't fit at least not yet. I also wish you could choose color because we got the pink one, and my son and his pet are boys, lol...so would have liked blue. But oh well it does state colors vary."
1,Broke in 2 places immediately!,Two of the hook rings fell off as soon as I used this item and got lost in the grass. Was very frustrated.
4,so adorable,This harness and leash set is adorable and easy to use for anybody at any age to use. It's also very comfortable for my daughter's bunny.
5,Love this!,Givenchy Magic Khol Eye Liner pencil is probably the best pencil EVER. French model Mariacarla Boscono uses it as a lip liner (I use it on the eyes). I love this pencil and recommend it to others. The product was packaged nicely and it arrived in perfect condition. I am pleased and highly recommend this vendor. Thank you.
3,fun,It was a fun movie. I loved all the tennis moves. I liked the background scenery because that area is one of my favorite places.
3,gritty,"I tried substituting this for regular white rice flour in a steamed recipe and it was just too hearty. Last year, this item was 50 cents more expensive."
5,Great flour,This is a high quality flour from a source I have trusted for many years. I can always depend on Bob's Red Mill products to be the same great quality every time.
4,Incredible amount of information,Pierre Dubois covers a vast array of different types of faeries. This is more for the serious study of faeries and less on their cute aspects. Contains lots of information from folklore and mythology.
4,The Great Encyclopedia Of Faeries is full of information,The Great Encyclopedia Of Faeries is full of good information and great illustrations.The Stories are really wonderful!
1,Fairies... not what I had in mind..,"This book isn't at all what I had hoped it would be. The stories and descriptions are ok.. they seemed to concentrate more on norse myths... but the illustrations were so disappointing. I am a big Brian Froud fan... and after seeing his magnifican drawings, well.. these just don't even compare. So if you like diversity, this might be ok for you. But if you like the beautiful artwork... I'd pass on this one."
2,Disappointed,I purchased this book for my daughter in hope that it would turn out a bit better than reviews i had read but I am sad to say it wasn't. It has a beautiful cover but that is it. The information is good but the pictures are absolutely terrible. They are so basic and look like they have been drawn by a child or teenager not an artist. Looking at the pictures didn't even make me want to read the book because i was so disappointed.
4,Dead Run,"This movie was one of Urich's best...he was charming, tough, and vulnerable. A good Saturday evening with a bag of popcorn movie..."
3,some sort of defect on it,"Didn't have time to inspect it before wrapping. When I went to put the corkscrew away, I found that the base of the item was dirty and that the metal part that holds the wine bottle neck had some slight corrosion and scratching, or some sort of defect on it."
5,Item Assesment,"It's a great product, you get rid of annoying dripping while pouring your wine, while you keep the remaining wine perfectly closed for future consumes.I highly recommend this product without any hesitation."
4,nice stopper/pour-spouts,"We've been using these for a few months now and they seem to work really well. Much easier than reinserting the cork, these appear to seal the bottles well. The mini-stopper inside the pour spout is a nice touch, allowing easy use of the pour spout (which itself is very nice)."
5,Well pleased,They work great on wine and olive oil. It saves the dripping and is much easier to use than twisting caps or pulling corks.
1,"Great design, for awhile","I bought these 2-pak pourers in October, 2009. They have been in fairly continuous use - one is always in a bottle, the second one occasionally in a second, backup bottle, but both received same amount of use since I switched them back and forth.I just noticed this week that they are both bubbling up chrome on the inside of the spout. A bit has already flaked off and gone into the wine. I guess the wine is too acidic for chrome. They are a wonderful design if you store the wine upright. The rubber cork doesn't really form a tight seal at all, it sits snugly with a little extra grab because it's rubber. They look and feel great and I really enjoyed using them, for these 13 months, though I would have stopped using them earlier if I had noticed the problem. Will look elsewhere to replace them."
1,Ouchy,The looped handle grip is inserted too deep into the pourer that it is difficult to grip and then it hurts the fingers when you do get a hold of it and try to pull it out. You cannot pull it straight either you must twist it making it even more difficult since you barely got it by the tip of your finger. A pair of needle nose pliers worked for me until I purchased some Oxo's :). This product definitely needs improvement !
1,Looks good but it leaks,"I liked the look of these stoppers so I bought some but have been very dissapointed. If you store your wine upright, they are probably fine, but if you store your wine on its side, as I do in my refrigerator's horizontal bottle holder, they are worse than useless because the cork pops out and there goes all your wine - or at least most of it. This has happened to me the last two times I have used this stopper, so I'm not willing to chance wasting any more wine by trying again."
4,Very nice product.,"I have been using these stoppers now for a few months and have found them very effective. They have a very nice tight seal, slow easy pour, and are easy to clean. The only thing lacking is a filter screen otherwise would have given 5 stars."
3,wine time,"a verry nice elegant look, works ok but does not completely stop leakage if you lay the bottle on it's side.Overall the winne stopper pourer works and looks good."
5,No leaks and Great pouring,"I found no leaks from the stopper and pouring device is awesome. For those reviews that had leaky situations, they probably just had bad luck and got a lemon. Otherwise, both of mine work perfectly; I violently shook my wine bottle to test them. Good product and nice elegant finish!"
1,Never again.,"This thing is trouble right out of the box. Pushes itself out of the bottle as soon as you let go of it. I think it's only successful if you have a bottle with a precisely sized neck. It's better than plastic wrap and a rubber band, but just barely. I would never trust it for pouring either."
2,Was this program created in another language and translated,"It would seem that this software would do for the beginning CAD user, but the training program (Supposedly ""interactive"" but not so on my Windows ME system. An enabling file ""shimgw.dll"" corrupted my operating sysytem so badly I had to do a reinstallation)... is full of ""unclear and non-operable"" instructions... at least for me! There is no free tech support! The terms used are strange to say the least. ""Explode"" means ""Ungroup"", etc. There are no manuals to purchase except on from the manufacturer for [money] which I'm hesistant to buy because it (too) may be full of the same ""unclear and non-operable"" instructions. I'm a new purchaser and may become more enthusiastic after this painful and time-consuming learning curve..."
1,Very poor documentation,This software package promises a lot bug has no documentation.I purchased the standard package and tech support sent me training CD's (for a price!) that were for professional. The GUI's don't match so I couldn't follow the training. I also can not use this because CD7 software is not working properly and could not get any help tech support. Save your money and don't buy this.
5,Cultural Ecology,"VERY useful!Though it may be an old book, it is very well organized, and a very concise, informative text. A little bit dry, but a good tool for any students interested in anthropology, or subsitence examples around the world."
3,Not very flopsie,We returned this stuffed dog which was not at all floppy but very stiff and hard. It was also not very cute in person
5,bedtime kitty,"I bought this for my grandaughter for Christmas. She has a calico cat which had an accident on her bed, so kitty is not allowed to sleep with her anymore. She loves the new kitty and she can sleep with her! Life is good again."
4,Better than expected.,"My daughter, who is a cat fanatic, for this for Christmas and loves it. The thing is huge. It has to be longer that 24 inches."
4,SHARK LAKE IS INFESTED WITH ADVENTURE!,"This 3rd exciting novel takes you back into the adventurous life of Ben Gannon and his girlfriend Sass as they embark on yet another action-filled adventure. John McKinna's series is always a delightful read with stories filled with action and adventure but also filled with delightful and colorful characters of both good and bad persuasions. Ben is drawn to his lost friend by a vision and the man's wife to save him from an island prison that is not only underwater but - you guessed it - surrounded by man-eating sharks! With a badass sidekick named Naji and a throw-away stoner named Head, they fly away into high adventure and a rescue that was very fun and exciting to read. This writer is never boring to read and is just getting better and better as he goes along. The whole story was well executed in terms of great range of characters and storyplot. This is a must read for all. So strap on your underwater gear and dive in!"
4,"Exciting, entertaining.","Pretty darn good for guy-oriented genre fiction. Not being a guy myself, I don't digest a lot of books like this, but this one was a pleasant diversion. Usually when I try action-type books I get disappointed, but Shark Lake (which I bought simply because everyone's had sharks crammed down their throat all summer by the news media) was very entertaining and refreshingly well-written. Nice turn of phrase. I could have done without some of the blood and guts, but I guess it's a guy thing, right? Boys will be boys. Fortunately, I found the female lead in the story to be quite well rendered, which gave me a character I could identify with. Pretty good, pretty good. Shark Lake gets a thumbs up from me."
5,One of the greatest shorts I've seen-,"I first heard about this from a friend he sent it to me as an inspiration , I'm an animator myself, it's a great story and well worth the investment- its about ten minutes long and a great short I have no regrets."
5,Grandson's favorite,"I gave this musical toy to my grandson for Christmas. It seems whenever I'm talking to my daughter on the phone, he is playing with his musical blocks. I highly recommend to educational and fun toy - probably best for young children 9 months to 3 1/2 years old."
2,buyer beware,"Beware. There are several versions of this product. The description on Amazon is misleading. The new version of the music blocks, which most amazon sellers will be carrying, has Mozart, jazz, and world music hardware for your music selection. It is NOT compatible with any of the cartridges to select alternative music selections. The product description is not correct. If you want this option, you need to find a seller of the older model or be prepared to do a lot of returns of models and cartridges. If you are happy with the three music selection in the built in hardware, the product has won several toy awards and I am sure is wonderful. The new model I have I will say is not digital CD quality, however. It is equitable to most children toys, so a little disappointed as I expected a toy focused on music would have better quality."
5,Wonderful toy,"This is a wonderful toy. It is a little advanced for my 15 month old, but he enjoys putting the blocks in place. He ""broke"" one of the blocks almost immediately, by throwing it - it doesn't always play when pressed and has a small piece rattling around inside of it. Other than that I think it is something he can grow with and learn to use ""properly"" over time."
1,Broken after only a few weeks,"We had the older version of this toy for our 15 year old daughter when she was small, and absolutely loved it. We bought this version for our toddler, and have been hugely disappointed. She picked it up to come and show us her music, it hit the carpet, and hasn't worked since. Conveniently, Neurosmith's web site has no links for customer service - they just send you to amazon to buy the products. So, I am apparently out of luck as far as getting a repair or replacement. I am very disappointed - this was her present from Santa Claus! I would say ""don't bother"" with this."
4,Trurh and Duty,This book is wonderful easy reading. This is a real insiders account of the pressures placed on media. In today's 24 hour news cycle we have been convinced that all of the push and pressure is on the politicians. Here we find out that politicians sometimes push back.
1,According to Ms. Mapes it's still everyone elses fault.,"Dan Rather and Mary Mapes decided to run with a story about Bush's service in the Texas Air National Guard. Unfortunately they failed to do what so many newsreaders do which is to actually do any investigative reporting.The documents they attempted to use to bolster their piece on Bush were discredited because the font used on the documents was not commonly used, most especially at the level in the military where the ""documents"" were supposedly authored.Naturally rather than take responsibility for the lack of investigation into the legitimacy of the documents, Ms. Mapes would rather blame her and CBS's failure on almost everyone else. This book is Ms. Mapes attempt to redeem herself and it fails abysmally."
1,Unbelievable,"I read most of this today, but fortunately didnt have to buy it.And then I watched her today on the morning shows and this evening on CNN.This woman--who has been a ""journalist"" for twenty years--actually believes that the forged Bush documents are true because they have not been disproved!Unbelievable.I am not a Bush-partisan, but this type of self-analysis by ms Mapes really raises questions of what else in her twenty year career meets her same standards.What was her publisher thinking when he decided to publish this rationale? Please dont buy this book--so that the publisher gets the message that this is fiction, not non-fiction. Unbelievable."
1,Fantasy or Denial?,Don't waste your money. Mapes still defends CBS and blames bloggers who outed the forged document. She lives in an alternative universe. Wouldn't it be wonderful if the press took responsibility for their errors?
1,"Here's what you need to know about Mary Mapes, so-called ""Journalist""","Reporter Brian Ross: ""Do you still think that story was true?""Ex-CBS producer Mary Mapes: ""The story? Absolutely.""Ross: ""This seems remarkable to me that you would sit here now and say you still find that story to be up to your standards.""Mapes: ""I'm perfectly willing to believe those documents are forgeries if there's proof that I haven't seen.""Ross: ""But isn't it the other way around? Don't you have to prove they're authentic?""Mapes: ""Well, I think that's what critics of the story would say. I know more now than I did then and I think, I think they have not been proved to be false, yet.""Ross: ""Have they proved to be authentic though? Isn't that really what journalists do?""Mapes: ""No, I don't think that's the standard."""
2,Documents,"According to Mary Mapes, documents are authentic until proven otherwise. Using this twisted notion, until Mary Mapes can prove the document indicating that she is a habitual shoplifter, is not authentic, then she is a shoplifter. Nice one Mary."
1,Criteria for Purchase ?????,"Although I have been of the opinion that this is a deceitful person with an agenda and no regard for the actual truth, I had planned to purchase her book and take a fresh view. I have however seen her recent appearances on the news and talk show circuit and find my original suspicions confirmed. This is one bitter and mean lady. I have no doubt that a person like W had an easier time with his service than us regular folks would.... but to date I have seen no evidence of the kind of fraud she alleges. I see no reason to buy this book so I can hear her assertion that it is up to the President to prove her claims wrong !!! She still will not admit that the documents that were the basis of her story are flawed AT ALL !"
1,The Liberal Mind Set at Work,"Thought maybe by reading Ms Mapes book one could see if she was telling the truth or was deliberately trying to destroy a sitting President. Found neither. Found that Ms Mapes to have an extreme warped liberal mind set and she truly believes that those to right of her and their ideology are evil. President Bush leads that ideology so he is the most evil of them all and must be destroyed. Four legs good, two legs bad. Liberalism good, Conservativism bad. Mary Mapes good, George W. Bush evil. There must is a phobia for this warped way of thinking? Otherwise how could one can find evidence of wrong doing that isn't there and overlook real evidence that would exonerate? Now in Ms Mapes' world it is up to the reader to either blindly accept or prove through a court of law that is written is a documentary is false. Personally, Ms Mapes clearly appears to be one sick twisted liberal puppy."
1,MARY MAPE'S TRUTH AND DUTY,"This is a loser. She should get together with other people who write these books that are full of lies like Joe Wilson's, Richard Clarke and Cindy Sheehan. Don't waste your money on this stuff when there are some really good books out there."
1,Caught Red Handed Again,"Mary was not just caught red handed with forged documents, for which she vouched, purporting to show George W. Bush was a deserter, but CBS's own investigation determined that Ms. Mapes also knew that Lt. George W. Bush had volunteered for Viet Nam service. Check it out for yourself:[...]Mapes has never disclosed this information in interviews or books. She had a professional duty to disclose this fact, and it undoubtedly contributed to her discharge from CBS. Her subsequent writings reveal her to be a highly partisan operative interested more in propaganda that helps her cause than in disclosing simple fact.People familiar with Ms. Mapes' questionable record will not be surprised by any of this, but kool-aid drinkers who suffer from Bush Derangement Syndrome will find deliciou swilling here."
2,Unfair treatment - poor book,"Mary Mapes have no doubt been subjected to an incredibly unfair attack by part of the conservative right and that is tragic. In my book it doesnt even matter, that the newspiece that lead to it, was not very good journalism, was not all that well researched, balanced and a host of other things we all expect from good journalists. She was victimised, pure and simple.Her book is unfortunately not a very good one, she is too self serving and too impressed with herself. Given her expericence, she should be able to give such a book a lot more teeth, be a lot sharper and to the point in her counter attack and let the reader more into her life at the time all of this was going on."
1,TRUTH....YOU CAN'T HANDLE THE TRUTH!,"This book proves that MARY MAPES CAN'T HANDLE THE TRUTH. Two document experts told CBS that the documents didn't appear to be authentic but CBS ignored them. Bob Burkett, who was the main source for the story, is a known political hack who had an axe to grind. The memos were said to be from Col. Killian's private files. However, Col. Killian's wife and son both said that he didn't keep private files. Killian's secretary said that she didn't type the memos and that Col. Killian didn't type. There were red flags popping up all over the place that should have alerted Ms Mapes and her cohorts at CBS that this story didn't hold water.Ms Mapes was fired because of this fiasco, and rightfully so, and now she wants to cash in with a book called ""Truth And Duty."" The truth is that if Ms Mapes had done her duty as an objective, ethical journalist, she would have never aired that story."
2,Historian reviews,"I found this to be an astounding account of a lone artillery battery that obviously won the American Civil War singlehandedly!They were always triumphant and seem to always be engaged in actions in which the enemy was always soundly defeated and incurring casualties at least three times that of the US forces, amazing, as a Civil War historian of some forty years standing I found this account to be of little value to the researcher. Imagine my consternation when I found pages 242, 243, 246, 247, 250, 251,254, 255, 258, 259,262, 263,266, 267, 270,and 271 totally blank!!this from a major publisher..this was a waste of my money."
3,BTOs greatest hits,"A lot of filler type songs, but it also contains their big hit songs. Price was right however because I bought it used."
3,"Just play ""Taking Care of Business!""","Just play ""Takin' Care of Business!""That scene with Canadian rockers Bachman-Turner Overdrive in the Simpsons cracks me up every time I think about it. Homer probably would have enjoyed a bare bones hits collection like BTO's Greatest. It gets right to the point, collecting both of BTO's big hits (""You Ain't Seen Nothin' Yet"" and of course ""Takin' Care of Business"") as well as ten other songs that were moderately successful at the time but don't get played every day on classic rock radio. They're all pretty much about driving and/or rocking, and you really can't go wrong with that.There are better BTO collections out there (Goldis particularly good), but if you're looking for a decent, dirt-cheap introduction to the band, BTO's Greatest ought to do just fine. The sound quality is pretty lousy, but this disc was released back in 1986, so that's to be expected. Just turn up the volume and ""get to the `workin' overtime part!"""
2,RedHat 9 For Dummies,"Nearly a 1000 pages and mostly fluff! If you're trying to set up a home network with Windows and Linux computers, this is not the book for you. His examples have gaping holes, with no explanations for things that might go wrong! He assumes that everything will work the first time. Anybody who ever works with computers knows about that!"
2,"Lots of info, but who is this book for?","If you don't know your mouse from an iptable, I wouldn't recommend buying this book. While it is chock full of info, the majority of it seems geared to more hardcore power users. The book starts off slow and easy, but then suddenly everything is in command-land. I still find it handy as a reference, but it isn't really isn't a good book for beginner or intermediate users."
2,all fluffy,"this book was a complete waste of my money. i am an experienced programmer with the microsoft platforms and i have run dozens of servers in a webfarm. i bought this book to help me add a redhat server to my home network. i wanted to set it up to run PHP on apache with mySQL. anyway my NIC card was not autodetected and i needed to get the drivers as source code and compile them. this is pretty standard fare for a linux setup. anyway the book does not even touch this subject. if you know next to nothing about PC's maybe this book could help you out. but i dont think the majority of linux users would fall into that category. so far the only benefit of this book is that it came with the 3 cd's of the redhat 9 distro, but i obviously scored those myself from their FTP site already. anyone want to buy a nearly mint copy of this book? :)"
4,Insider Prosecution,"The Prosecutors is a good book. It is very insightful about the world of U.S. Attorneys--both the legal and political aspects--and their prosecution of white-collar crime. Stewart chose several good case studies to analyze how prosecutors work and also highlight the political reality of their position. The book paints an unflattering picture of the Reagan Administration's handling of crimes by large businesses, including the machinations of Rudy Guliani who is made out as a machiavellian up and comer. This is a good book for people interested in law and specifically prosecution, but hopefully it does not frighten people away from such a career path. It is also has some interesting history of the Reagan Administration and Guliani, but it is fairly dated information now and doesn't have the same impact it would have when the book was first published. All in all, I would recommend this book and encourage aspiring attorneys to read it."
3,another pop rockin quo effort,"I felt at the time that this one was alot stronger than the really poppy 'aint complaining' but not as good as the pretty good 1986 effort 'in the army now"". Still it only has a few real rockers and the rest is more quo pop rock.The band went through several phases, psych pop rock 1966-70, which is cool mostly, then their peak 1970-82 blues rocking coolness. followed by this rock and rock pop stage that lasted till the early zeros. Their NEXT one is much better though and returned them to greatness (rock til you drop) before they went on to several more pop rockers. There is some really great songs on here though, I don't think 'aint complaining' had one great song on it, songs like 'power or rock and roll' etc so it's not a write off for harder rockin quo fans. I like these pop rockers from the band but in reality they are not as great as their more straight rock ones."
3,dissapointed,I am allso a long time fan of status quo and i must say i am a little dissapointed.This album is a setback from tha cd aint complaining.IF you buy it dont exspect status quo to rock. they do only in a few songs.
5,Best Quality tools book for recommended readings in training,"This is one of the best books I have ever reviewed. It is so easy to know the quality tools but understanding the tools is the key to effective implementation. The book provides a comprehensive review of all the tools in the quality profession with indexed case studies and applications. I use the quality tools while training Meirc participants on Total quality, six sigma, simplification of work processes and procedures in Dubai seminars and it is certainly has gained our participants lots of benefits on applying these tools. I would highly recommend this book for all quality professionals in the quality management and training."
2,Not a book for professionals,The items are briefly described and are more in text format. Examples are not enough from my point of view. As somebody who is professionally involving with quality issues (Quality Managers or Auditors) this could not be a good book to learn something deeply but also this book only introduces you very briefly what kind of tools are available in world of quality.
5,Succinct reminder,"If you need an all-in-one succinct reminder, a summary for a method, or a matrix of applicable methods to a particular quality problem, this book is it. I heartily recommend it."
5,Excellent music for introspection & meditation,Twilight Concertos has been a wonderful piece of music for my spiritual introspection and meditation. It reaches deep into your spirit and soul and allows you to connect with your Creator. I love it! and I think you will too.
5,amazing,amazing toy for anyone who have interest in building and engineeringcan creat may things that you can imagine!
1,Horrible,"As soon as we got the ball it didn't feel like composite leather it felt plastic we pumped the ball up within a couple hours it had lost air and was dead, this was used only indoors I will not waste money on another of these balls also it says synthetic leather on the ball I will not recommend this ball to anyone else"
3,Abundance Counter Mats,They are just great. They work well when you have something hot to set on them.
5,This girl is Smokin' Hot!,"I love this album...sultry, provocative and soothing at once, she's eerily reminiscent of Holiday. When she sings 'God Bless the Child' you know it's blessed good, and listening to 'I've Got the World on a String' conjures up visions of her sittin' on a rainbow, with a delicate but strong string on her (no doubt) dainty finger. Give us more, we beg."
4,Beautiful pictures!,"This book has a very short story, but the pictures are wonderful. It is like a brief postcard visit to Paris."
2,OKAY,I think the book was okay. But I am only ten so I do not like to read 1st grade books! So kids who like Easy Readers I encourage you to read the adventurist book called Paris Cat!
5,GREAT ITEM!,"This book is a must for any Blade Runner fan.....very technical,beautiful pics and detail based.I just wish it was a bigger more expansive book of the entire film.But still a GREAT BOOK!"
2,Poor book,"Don't spend your money, it's a poor book, poor content, poor pics many in black and white, I'm still waiting for THE BOOK about Blade Runner."
3,The Blade Runner Book,"...is already out.The MOVIE was based on the BOOK ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?"", by Philip K. Dick published in 1968. It is worth a read if you're a fan."
4,YOU MIGHT LIKE IT,"Some of these stories were interested. The one with the party I had to fastforward on. I didn't quite understand the stories, but just to be fair I gave it 4 stars anyway. I realize this is not meant to be a Hollywood production."
1,disappointed,"This is not a true story, I was very disappointed, I read the reviews before I purchased the book, they led me to think this was a true story. I would have given this no stars if I could. If you like fiction this would be an interesting book for you, I only like to read non fiction."
4,Unique plot: wonderfully complicated and surprising,"I loved the book, ""Dead Silence"". Both my husband and I read it. The storyline was interesting. The development of the characters was quite good. I felt like I knew the Hathaways and their boys'personalities; the newsroom with all its politics (so real!), and the humaness of the characters. The pacing was such that you didn't want to put the book down. My only disappoinment was that the author didn't give us the reasons for the abductions; the death of the one boy and the induction into the cult of the other. I would have loved to have known all the details of what really happened that day, 15 years ago. I would have given the book a 5 rank if we had gotten ""the whole picture"". The book was too well written to leave us hanging on the ""why's"". Nevertheless, I thorougly enjoyed this book and will pass it on to others. Thank you!"
5,This is a Keeper,"This is the 4th book in Ron Handberg's series. All these crime novels take place in a top newsroom in the Twin Cities. Although all 4 were excellent, I thought this one was the best. The plot is based on something that really happened in Minneapolis in 1951. Handberg changes the timeframe and the characters, but the background of the story is the same. This book has it all...dirty politics, missing children, day-to-day working of a newsroom, great characters and superb writing. I highly recommend this book."
4,Not 5 stars but not bad,"I got this book as a hand-me-down. I looked it's review up on Amazon.com like I do with any book before I read it and was glad to see it had 5 stars. I started reading it with high expectations. The beginning is SLOW. It took me over a week to read and I average about a book every 3-4 days (I am a train commuter with very little of a life). In spite of the slow start, the book was not that bad. I like how it did not answer all the questions at the end and reminds you that life does not always have a happy ending.Well worth the week it took me to get through - still can't give it 5 stars though."
3,Rectangular burner covers,"Really do like them except for the fact they are a bit too shallow and don't set down on the stovetop. You should consider making them in both this size for older gas stoves and a new, deeper size for all the newer gas stoves with the higher burner grids. They probably work well for electric burners."
3,OK but...,The balls are OK for practice maybe but the seam could be noticed while you play. Very cheap though.Next time I'll pay more.
4,Halloween gift,"I purchased this movie for my grandson for Halloween. He really likes Dora and the other characters, and he and watches it often."
4,"Excellent Book, Terribly Bound, Ridiculously Priced","This is an excellent examination of the history of Japanese imperialism in East Asia -- a book more for someone with a basic understanding of the history who wants more depth. Beasley writes well for an academic historian; there is no trendy jargon or dubious syntax. Unfortunately, Oxford has yet again published something utterly shoddy. This book -- the paperback -- costs over $60, but the spine was put together in such a poor way that the pages did not take long to start falling out. For a paperback priced so exorbitantly, this is outrageous.This year marks the 100th anniversary of Japan's annexation of Korea. Beasley's book is both a fair assessment and a timely read if you want to better understand what happened and why. If you can get it from a library or read it on kindle, by all means read it. It's worth it."
2,Puzzling Conclusion,"Author believes the ""character of [the] society"" and ""international circumstances"" pushed Japan to imperialism. Concludes: ""Its [Japanese Imperialism] most evident achievement was to undermined--decisively, as it proved--European colonialism there [East and south-east Asia]."""
2,Not for the Lay Reader,"This is an exceedingly dry, academic overview of Japanese foreign policy from 1894-1945. For the academic, it is probably an invaluable resource, but for the lay reader, it is a very slow read and not worthwhile.There are two major problems with the work. First, Beasley's style is extremely dry. The writing style is not in any way bad, just boring.Two, Beasley's treatment is very methodical and he avoids analyzing Japanese actions in any larger context (with the exception of the first and last chapters). This means that each chapter devolves into a recitation of actions relevant to the chapter topic only without any larger historical arc. Larger social, economic and military trends and decisions are not discussed -- rather we get a very narrow review of Japanese foreign policy decisions only.Really, a better title for the volume would have been ""A History of Japanese Foreign Policy Memos, 1894-1945."""
3,Great Bateman Prose but Disappointing Plot,"Empire State shows that Colin Bateman still has one of the most witty and entertaining voices in popular fiction. His descriptions and dialogue remain as sharp as ever. Unfortunately, the anti-climatic, contrived ending (more contrived than normal for Bateman) to a promising plot left me dissatisfied. Overall, a step down from ""Divorcing Jack"" and ""Cycle of Violence"" a.k.a. ""Crossmaheart""."
3,SYLVIE THE FRENCH GIRL BORN IN BULGARIA,"One of the most bizarre compilation you can buy regarding FRENCH music.In her young days, SYLVIE did a lot of covers of AMERICAN songs;sometimes quite fun to hear(EN ECOUTANT LA PLUIE,SHA LA LA),sometimes awful(L'HOMME EN NOIR having absolutely no relation to the original PRETTY WOMAN of ROY ORBINSON)In between were the hits conceived for her(LA PLUS BELLE POUR ALLER DANSER,COMME UN GARCON). This 3 cd collection has all the good stuff but unfortunally also some of the worst.It's a mixed bag ,so you've been warned.Now i hope that SYLVIE VARTAN doesn't read AMAZON critics, because i still like the best of her"
2,Not what was shown in the picture,"I really like the picture of these earrings and having received a gift of another Peora item, I was really excited to get them. I, however, didn't get what was pictured. The earrings are a diamond shape, not oval. The scroll inside is similar but not the same either. I was really disappointed! I like the ones that I got but I wanted what was shown; I have a piece that is oval and these earrings were purchased to go with that. I'm keeping the ones that I do have but I have to rate not as well as I would like simply because it's showing one thing and I got something different."
2,Difficult to read,"I cannot honestly say whether or not this book would have helped us because I couldn't get myself to read it. It is not organized in a reader-friendly way and it is difficult to get help quick. When you're sleep-deprived, the last thing you need is to slog through a difficult book. I recommend instead ""Sleep: how to teach your child to sleep like a baby"" from Child magazine."
2,Just an outline of the options...,"Because this book was edited by the AAP, I expected a detailed and methodical perscription for getting my baby to sleep. Instead, the book is really an expanded pamphlet that describes the different sleep options out there with a clear bias against co-sleeping. Frankly, I wasn't interested in co-sleeping with my baby either, but I found their ""con"" (from the ""pro/con"" section) to be laughable--that co-sleeping is dangerous because you could smother the baby accidentally. Lots of other books out there. Don't buy this one."
4,Well rested new mom,"Although this book got poor reviews based on its poor organization, the tips in it have worked wonderfully for my baby. I followed its recommendations for a 6 - 8 week old baby and after a few days, my daughter responded very well. She began sleeping all night (11 hours) when she was 10 weeks old and I believe it is because when she awakes during the night (as all babies do), she is able to soothe herself back to sleep. Follow this method for all naps and nighttime and you should see success! The crying is minimal compared to other methods, and my little girl never cried more than six minutes without my comforting her. Give it a try."
5,Very Practical,I really enjoyed the practical and informative information in this book better than some the other books I have read on sleep.I would recommend reading this book.
3,"Basic, cheap plastic stylus","After losing my Palm T/X stylus, I thought perhaps I could make do with these styluses. Since they don't come close to fitting the T/X I did not end up using them. There is a reason this pack of 4 are inexpensive. They are very basic plastic styluses."
3,Works,Does what it says but it does take a few days. There is a better dryer but for the money this is good.
4,"Very Nice, but only works with large reserviors",Between my wife and I we own 4 (yes 4) camelbaks. I prefer this to the other drying mechanism we own. Simpler to set up then the 2-piece style. BUT will not fit smaller reservoirs or reservoirs with a baffle in the middle.
3,Dissappointing,"This book is unusual. It has no clear ending (if you like this read ""The If Game"") and the blurb rather conflicts with the real message. The message completely overtakes the ending (note how a moral can be properly pulled off: ""Power of Three"") and I felt as annoyed as when going to see the Evolution film and finding that Head & Shoulders shampoo had completely overtaken the actual film. The back of the book suggests light-hearted reading, lots of happy fantasy etc. (Diane Duane's Young Wizard series style - or, in fact, Harry Potter) But this didn't really come through as the ending was so completely overtaken by the moral. Ray appears for basically no reason at all, and reading about Race's life doesn't really make me very warm-hearted. The book also sometimes moves quickly while at other times having such a slow narrative that I skipped paragraphs."
1,Help Wanted,"I'm sure its a good book, but I really can't get past the first page! I think it's so bad or badly written that i am able to get distracted so easily and it the subject really doesnt appeal to me"
2,A Christmas Kiss,"I bought this movie because of the high reviews. I disliked it because I thought, in the story, the ingenue was too young and I couldn't stand the hair on the leading actor. The only character that stood out, IMO, was Priscilla, she, at least, was believable. Acting is okay, just a weak story."
1,Stupid,"Not really sure what to say about this movie other than we trashed it within the first 10 minutes of it. It's probably the most shallow ""love"" movie I have ever seen."
3,A Christmas Kiss,It was here quickly and was in great shape. I was a little dissapointed in the plot. I would not buy it again.
5,Lovely and romantic!,I loved this movie and have watched it several times. Who doesn't love a good romance! Thank you very much!
3,Loved the Movie but.......,I love this move and wanted it bad enough to buy it at no matter the cost. The thing I hated was there was no Closed Caption on the movie which I need. I will not buy another movie with out checking for the Closed Caption.
4,Quite Enjoyable,Cute Christmas movie that ends up the way it should with the right gal getting the guy & the conniver being shown the door--so to speak.
4,Sweet Christmas flick,"Okay, so I love Christmas movies, really, I do. This one is a really sweet movie and I won't repeat the story line as it is already written for you. I enjoyed Wendy's friends, they added some unexpected spice to this film. If you are into Christmas chic flicks, this should be on your list. And yes, it does have a predictable love story ending but worth watching anyway."
2,Disappointed by reviews,"I was in the mood for a new Christmas movie, so I checked here and read some reviews for this movie, which I had never heard of. All of the reviews seemed good, so I bought it. I was pretty disappointed. The biggest disappointment was the leading man. He wasn't exactly ""easy on the eyes."" It's pretty hard to root for a couple to get together when you think the guy's ugly. I know that looks aren't everything in real life, but movies aren't real life. I watch them to escape my boring real life and I expect the people in them to be attractive! Sue me. The female lead's best friends aren't good actresses and the only one that WAS good was the villain. She was pretty good. I wouldn't recommend this movie and will be selling my copy."
4,Christmas,"Nice and easy, simple plot. Boy meets nice girl, boy already taken by bad girl. Bad girl loses, good girl wins.No surprises which is, in a way, okay, but then again, tossing in a little curve to the plot would have been nice. Likely, as with all my Christmas movies, I'll watch it again.And again.And, maybe, again."
4,A Christmas Kiss,I am very hard of hearing so I wear hearing aids. I love this movie but this DVD didn't have the closed caption that I need to hear all the words. I always make sure I get closed caption on any DVD i purchase and I was hoping that this one had it. I was very disappointed!!
