3,Jillian Should Stick to What She Does Best,"This isn't the worst yoga DVD I've come across. In it's defense, on the DVD, Jillian DOES admit that yoga is something new for her, too. It's not her forte...and that's quite obvious. I've been doing yoga myself for only 2 months, but it seems like I have a better grasp of it than Miss Michaels. Her practice is forced and I don't seem to get the same benefits out of it as I do regular yoga DVDs. Yes, she's trying to help you burn more calories than a typical yoga session would, but it just comes off awkward. I would only recommend this for die-hard Jillian fans. NOT for the yoga enthusiast, and I wouldn't even suggest it for yoga beginners or those simply curious about the practice. She doesn't do it justice. (Try Element: Power Yoga DVD instead.)"
5,Great building toy for little ones,"I love this toy, it is one of my 2.5 yr old's favorite toys to play with. Can't complain about anything."
4,heiruspector,"yo, just to clarify, this is their third release, their first being antidisestablishedmetabolism, way underground, not all that many people have heard it. Their second was Small Steps, and their third being, of course, tiger dancing. This CD is pretty dope, and you should definitely cop it if you are a fan of heiruspecs, or hip-hop in general. They did a pretty good job following up small steps, which was an incredible album, but in my opinion didn't do quite as good of a job. Not to be a hater, because i most definitely recommend this album to anyone who liked small steps, and know the band well. Definitely cop it, but don't expect to be amazed by every track like you may have been with small steps."
4,Really works,"i have been using this product for nearly two months, and i have seen growing some new hair on my forehead, i definitely recommend this product. of course help yourself with a shampoo to avoid the hair drop"
3,USE/or LOSE,THIS PRODUCT WORKS WELL TO KEEP WHAT YOU HAVE. THE OUT POINT IS ITS OILY. I STOPPEDUSEING IT AND LOST LOTS OF HAIR. TOO LATE NOW TO USE AGAIN. ONCE U START DONT STOP!IT DOES WORK.
3,why start?,I bought this product 5 months ago and I noticed a bit of growth on the temples. I hate putting this stuff on and its kinda messy. It seems that all the work I put into applying minoxidil was for nothing because after 48 weeks it wont work anymore on anybody due to the fact that your body builds up resistance to it. Dont waste your money on something that will stop working. All these products are scams because they come from a business that just wants to make money. Who knows what were putting into our body with this stuff.
3,not as good as Nature's Bounty Biotin 5000mcg,been taking Kirkland Minoxidil-5% 5 months and did see more Hair but after taking Biotin 5000mcg for the last 2 weeks I have and I see more hair on my head.lot of hair that did not grow in years now have color.read reviews on Nature's Bounty Biotin 5000mcg on here and [....]
2,Kirkland Minoxidil-5% Extra Strength Hair Regrowth for Men,I actually did not use this product: Minoxidil-5% Extra Strength Hair Regrowth for Men that I bought on Amazon site. The reason for that was that some very important information about the advertised product was not disclosed and I discovered that only when the package arrived.If only I knew upfront that this product is only applicable to the vertex area of the head I would never buy it.If anybody is interested why this limitation this is the response from Kirkland customer service: because the product was not tested on front or any parts of a head other than vertex.Kirkland Minoxidil 5% Extra Strength for Men - 6 Month Supply
4,Use Equate instead,Ive used Kirkland minoxidil and since switched to Equate brand. The equate brand seems to be less sticky and seems to dry faster. I would suggest using Equate instead.
3,Good for the Price,"I started balding noticeably in my mid-twenties and had finally come to the decision to do something about it. I started looking around for products which were effective and also reasonably priced. I found myself at Costco with my wife and saw this product. At the price (roughly the same as Amazon, but a few dollars cheaper), I thought, why not give this a shot. It took a good 1.5 months to see any real change, but I did freak out a bit during the shedding stage. (my wife will confirm) I was expecting a bit more hair regrowth, but maybe my hopes and expectations were higher than what you're supposed to see realistically.Overall a decent product at the price. Not a miracle worker."
5,HIGHLY recommend,"I am in my early 20s and experiencing hair loss. This product started growing new hair within the 1st month. Overall regrowth was outstanding. I regrew about 2cm on my scalp near the middle of my head and grew about 1/2cm from just about my forehead. There hasn't been any new growth since(probably just genetics) but I'm glad that I have regained the surprising amount that I have. I highly recommend this for anyone who, like me, is unfortunately experiencing hair loss as a young age and is self-conscious about losing it. I was depressed for a long time about it (once a few people pointed it out). Thanks to this (inexpensive) product, I am starting to feel my age again! :-)"
3,Either it works or doesn't,"Topical medical product such as this generally falls into two category--either works or not. It all depends on your genetic makeup. You can read all the reviews and do all the research, but the bottom line is that you won't know for sure until you try it. Most men who lost, or is losing, their hair and is concern about it are most likely willing to try anything, and this has a good value when compared to the name-brand counterpart; the rating I gave is purely for the price and not the result. Unfortunately this product didn't work for me, but that doesn't mean it won't work for you either."
2,Severe itching and dryness,"I decided to try this minoxidil product because of its low cost. However, It caused severe itching and dryness. Far more than other minoxidil products. I ended up using a couple of months worth."
2,Minoxidil-5% Extra Strength Hair Regrowth,"I really cant give a rating on this product. Theres a man in a homeless shelter who's either still bald, or has a healthy head of hair. I couldnt be bothered. I didnt need the scheduled application . I'd rather be a natural bald guy than one with ""stuff"" i have to use every day for rest of my life."
1,wasteful packaging,"There is a black cylindrical top over the cap on the bottle that exists only to make the product look taller.There isn't even a recycling symbol on it.This means energy wasted shipping empty space.Over the course of your lifetime, which is how long you'll need to keep buying it, you will be throwing out hundreds of these plastic things.Grow hair? maybe. Grow landfills? Guaranteed."
3,Slowing down the inevitable,"I have been using Minoxidil for many years, long past the time it could have been useful in regrowing any hair on my head. I am 70 years old. I believe it has slowed down the onset of total baldness for me."
5,It works really well on the back of your head.,"When the reading material says it doesn't work on the front forhead, just believe that because thats true. Sorry guys. You will totally get hair back on the back of your head. That works. Now for the part where it says if you stop then you will loose the hair. I'm scared to try that theory."
3,"minoxidil-5% extra strenth hair regrowth for men, 3 month supply","Alright, so after opening the item i realize that this hair regrowth product works especially for the vertex of the head. (The top and back of your head) which was a surprise. Maybe i didnt read it properly when choosing this product from amazon. Instruction says suppose to use it 2 times a week, and need to let product settle for at least 4-5 hrs. I try as often as i can. Its been a month, and i've seen no improvement, tho the instruction specifically said takes a minimum of 2 month to see result. Well, i 've bought it already so just got to bite the bullet and hope for the best. I'll probably post again if this product works and i buy a 2nd shipment then.The shipping by monsterhotdeal is really fast, and i have no problem with the shipping.Forgot the exact time , but it was prompt and there was no problem. thats it for the review enjoy guys."
3,Fair,"Product appears to be OK, but was poorly packaged and the boxes arrived badly dented. The bottles inside are OK, or at least the ones I have checked of the six in total in two separate boxes. I did contact the seller and heard NO response."
4,heads up,"It has not been two months yet so I can't comment on hair growth. But this must be said, as stated in the directions and warnings with the product, you will loose more hair with initial use. And also as stated by other users you may develop dandruff. I never have had this before in my life and it is localized solely on the area of application. I have got head and shoulders and this has fixed the problem. But you should be prepared. I assume that because all these warnings I heard before have come true that hair growth will appear at 2 months as promised. But just a heads up to anyone interested in the product."
3,Works but very greesy!,"I started using when I was 22. I had diffuse thinning, a noticable bald patch at the vernex, a receeding hairline and the typical temple hair loss. After the first two weeks, I would say about 25% of my remaining hair fell out and about 2 weeks after that I noticed the original hair I lost was growing back along with lots and lots of peach fuzz. 6 months on and some of the peach fuzz had turned to small, thick black hairs, 12 months on them hairs were like normal hair. Basically the product stopped hairloss, grew back the hair I had lost recently and grew back some of the hair that had been lost for a couple of years and thickened up the rest of my hair! The only drawback is that since it is so greasy, it does not dry fully and can transfer to your pillow causing a big bushy set of eyebrows to be formed and your hair looks kinda dirty and greasy!"
1,"rashes,dandruff and itching AWEFULL","i tried this product for 5 months,i gave myself a grade 3 haircut the day i started using it and took pics of my balding scalp area, every month ide do the same,haircut, pictures, i found i was getting terrible dandruff wich came with the most terrible iching, then started the rashes, after five months i couldnt stand it any longer and had to stop using it, the picure reults were dissapointing, no difference at all in hair grouth"
5,works but you have to stick to regimen :-(,"Minoxidil seems to work ok and in my case it appears to have worked everywhere I have tried it (as a test). I tried it around the the border of my face and ended up with pale peach fuzz on my temples bridging the area between my eyebrows and side burns.But you must stick to a strict regimen - forgetting a day or so isn't gonna make your hair drop but twice daily is the way to go. If the other sex can commit to ""the pill"" everyday, then we should be able to handle a few drops, massaging it in our scalps."
1,Get the foam instead!,"Although neither this liquid solution nor the foam helped my thinning hair, the Rogaine Foam treatment was MUCH easier to use. The liquid solution runs down your cheeks and back of the neck. It also stays oily the entire day. What a mess. Buy the Rogaine Foam instead."
2,Not too happy with the results,"I was kinda hopeful after reading all the reviews here that I could probably grow some hair too. So I bought this product and have been using this religiously for almost 4 months. I restrained myself from looking at my crown in the mirror or take a photo of it for these 4 months as I only wanted to look at the results after 4 months (the product info asks you to use it for 4 months at least and stop if no results are seen). To my disappointment, the hair loss seems like it worsened. The crown looks balder than ever.Well, the product does say that the results are not the same for all men, and so I will keep using it for another 2 months or so till I finish the bottles. I hear stories of guys saying this product has worked so well for them but I guess I am not one of them. I am giving it 2 stars because the product is definitely a cheaper alternative to the more expensive brand named products and is slightly easier on the pocket."
5,Excellent Value,Very convenient and good product. Will buy again if product is available Can receive mailings Will also recommend value is excellent
3,a so-so product.,"I think the main problem here is minoxidil itself. It works for a while, then it stops. And that's when the problem begins again. You could up the percentage of minoxidil that you apply to your scalp to get more hair, but that sounds rather risky for your health. I found a natural product that, combined with minoxidil, gave me great results: HAIR ESSENTIALS. A bit pricy, $42 a bottle plus shipping. But it works and it's natural. You can only get it from their website, but I definitely recommend it. I was losing hair at an alarming rate. Tried many brands of minoxidil with the same results. Then I came across Hair Essentials and my hair returned after no more than two months! I'm not kidding. It worked that fast. Give it a try."
1,Did not work for me,I am a 40 yr old with thinning hair. Used this for 3 months and it did not work for me. I am now back to Rogaine which I stopped using because of price but I guess this is another case of you get what you pay for.
1,Just use Rogain,first off and will be very brief and get to the point.1. do not buy if you want it to fix hair line- it is only designed to work for the back of head (vertex)2. it didnt work for me and used it faithfully as instructions showed3. leves white cracks in head and made scalp look an ADDTIONAL 20 YEARS OLDER ITS WRINKLY4. ROGAIN WORKED MUCH BETTER ITS A LITTLE MORE EXPENSIVE BUT IT AT LEAST WORKS PROPERLY AND REGROWS HAIR AND NOT JUST FOR ONE SPECIFIC SPOT
1,I will never buy Minoxidil with a Kirkland brand anymore,"I have been using generic minoxidil 5% from various suppliers for years. Recently, I ordered the 4-month package supplied by Kirkland. Guess what, after a month, my hair started to fall again. Although on the label, it is 5% minoxidil, there's no way for me to test whether it has 5% minoxidil or not... So I stopped using this one and quickly ordered another generic minoxidil from a different supplier and my hair loss seems slow down now. So conclusion: I will never buy minoxidil from Kirkland anymore."
4,Good,"I'd like to use this product, my hair is comming back what it was yet, but at leas this is reduncing the loss."
3,Allergic reaction after several days of usage,"I can't say that it worked because I was unable to use it to the fullest. I am allergic to something inside the ingredients. I believe it's the alcohol used in the mixture. It dried my scale up and made me itch like crazy. Unfortunately, I tried several other products but they all use the same alcohol ingredient.If you are allergic to rogaine, don't use this one - it has the same ingredient."
4,good stuff,been using twice daily for about a month now...i had a pretty bad receiding hair line going but this stuff is defintaly helping. My receiding hairline is all filled in with peach fuzz and it is getting thicker.only bad part is if it accidently drips down my face i will break out in acne where ever it went. Just gotta make sure to wash your face/hands really well after applying if you have oily skin.if it dries your scalp out i recommend head and shoulders
4,It's working,I am young and in the beginning stages of balding. So far it has stopped the falling out.
1,Cheap for a reason...,"I've used different types of minoxidil and this is the only product that increased the number of gray hairs, messed up the texture, and actually seemed to cause further hair loss... That's what I get for buying a knockoff...lol."
4,Works but makes hair look greasy all the time.,Good price. You have to apply 2 times a day. Bottle includes eye dropper applicator to spread liquid around thinning hair area. I used it for about 1 month. Thin hair area started to get a little thicker. But hair always looks greasy because liquid is oily. Stuff gets on pillows. Hair thins out again after non use of product.
3,Kind of icky...,"I have used both this and the rogaine foam for my balding head, and results aside the foam is far better than the liquid. With the foam it does not take very long to dry and so you can wear a hat or go lay down on your pillow after about fifteen minutes, but this stuff is an oily liquid and wont dry out for four hours. If you dont mind having oil on your head than its no big deal, but if you want to go out dont be expecting to put any of this on because somebody might want to touch your head and they will end up with grease all over their hands, gross. As for results, I havent ever seen much either with this or rogaine but I continue to use it because I believe it preserves what hair I have left."
3,Perfect Package & Right items.,"The package arrived before the specified time, perfect packaging. Ive been using it for about 1/2 a month now but for results gotta wait till at least 2 months. So ill write my review then, but for the transaction it was smooth. Highly recommend this seller."
4,very good,"The product is well known to me and was delivered in perfect order and on time. Thank you,LC"
1,They sent me Expired,I cant believe when I received monixidil they were expired. LOT/EXP 07-2010. I received this package in Miami but the fina user is in eecuador so its very difficul to return this product. i want my money back or other product
2,work better with dry scalp,"I have tried the product for 3 weeks, but I couldn't keep the treatment because the oily vehicle worsted my dermatitis.The excess of oil in the scalp is terrible for people with already oily hair and dermatitis. If the vehicle were alcohol, would be better."
1,Blurred Vision,"Given the reports that minoxidil also works on the front part of the head, I decided to try it. However, I had to stop using it after 2 months because of blurred vision which is a rare, reported side effect of minoxidil. This was most obvious when I looked at a traffic light 1 or 2 blocks away. I would get 2 or 3 images of the light which would merge as I got closer. The blurring occurs because these 2 or 3 images get superimposed on each other. I stopped using the minoxidil for a week and my vision is almost back to normal. I will try it again, but only using having the recommended dosage. By the way, no hair growth yet. Also, my name is Mark, not Marilyn. This website insists on using my wife's name even though it should know otherwise."
3,I think it works but some cautions,"I used the product for about a month. It gives you bad dandruff. I'm talkin about like dime sized flakes in some cases. However it did seem to stimulate some hair growth. I don't care too much about the dandruff, but it was causing me some chest pains and I just felt ""weird"" so I stopped using it. I feel back to normal now after about a week of not using it. I may ask my doctor if it's safe to keep using."
4,Great Product!!,"Great Product, but application is somewhat difficult. It is a little greasy and takes about thirty minutes to dry completely. Not a problem just has to be strategically planned into your routine, because it is difficult to style hair before it completely dries. Don't hesitate to buy. It also appears to be working well on my receding hairline, but I apply it there religiously. Highly Recommend. I give four stars only for the time it takes to dry."
4,Damn Alopecia-----AGAIN,"I'm still waiting for my stuff to come in the post....I hope it works for alopecia, lots of stress for the past few months has taken its toll. Reading the reviews gives me hope......Watch this space.I have read many reviews on this product, most have been positive, obviously side effects vary from person to person. Having experienced alopecia before, and waiting 6 years for my hair to come back, I really can't wait to try this."
2,Side Effects,"I've used the 5% Rogaine foam for awhile and it works without having side effects for me. I bought the Kirkland's brand because it was much cheaper, but after two uses I noticed my heart beating faster than normal, and some chest discomfort. You may be fine taking it, but be very aware of anything different use of this product. I'm discontinuing use of this and will stick to the Rogaine foam, since I know it works and doesn't give me sides."
5,outstanding product,"I have used this product for many years. However, mine seem to disappear - usually around the same time that one of my sons comes home for a visit and needs to pack a cooler to go back. This item is very versatile - can be used in ice chests without getting the food wet - underneath food served on the picnic table (like deviled eggs) - and can be used as a cold compress for an injury or whatever. I highly recommend having several on hand as they are WORTH IT!"
1,A little nervous,"This worked pretty well, but then I had one of the cells leak in my son's lunch. I know the stuff inside is supposed to be non-toxic, but, it still makes me a little nervous. I would rather just use an ice blanket that was filled with frozen water instead. I know it's probably silly, but I worry about the goo."
5,Ice Blanket a great thing,"I purchased the ""Ice Blanket"" for hot flashes, and it is just wonderful!! It stays cool for hours.Love it!!"
3,"OK, but don't stay frozen as long as I expected","These are pretty good, but don't stay frozen as long as I expected them to. By 11:30 AM they are all water, even in my insulated lunch bag.I bought these hoping they would be good for wrapping around yogurt and other items, but they form ""triangles"" more so than wrapping around securely. It's not bad, but not as flexible as I expected."
5,Color Gems Even with My Eczema,"53 year old, Asian. Five stars for Amazon Prime - can't get easier than one click. Delivery in two days!The severe eczema flare-ups to salon coloring and the cost at a salon drove me to find a different solution.The Product: 3.0 Dark Natural Brown - Color Gems has worked for me for years to cover my wiry, white hairs. The problem with coloring is that I have eczema flare up post-coloring. I have found that leaving the color on for only 20 minutes has helped significantly reduced symptoms. I use a generous amount of conditioner afterwards, rinse really well and don't use shampoo until the next day. I believe this process ensures that I won't need to color again for 6-7 weeks.I mix 3/4 oz Dark Natural Brown with 1/4 oz 1.1 blue black and 1/4 oz 4.1 dark ash brown to get the perfect natural Asian black (not the goth black). Since 4.1 is discontinued, not sure what I'll do to replace it.Vanity obviously prevails over eczema! Not sure how to stop!"
2,Not what I was hoping for,"I bought this not sure if it would work on my dark hair and sadly it didn't really do much of anything. It did add a red tint so when in the sun it shines as a nice redish brown, so thats kinda cool. I bet if you had lighter hair it would work much better. I almost ran out of it but thats because my hair is a bit longer then 23 inches so if your hair is much longer you may want to get two tubes. The shipping was fast it got to me a few days before they said it would so that was nice. I also thought it was a good price."
5,Great little Camera with a remote control and ease of use..,"I have had all the different brands of all kinds of electronics. After a review, a test and having alot of family and friends view my films nobody had any thing to say but ""That Was Great"". Easy to use, excellent battery location, No problems or regrets, I guess for all the cameras that were sold if only a few have negative comments thats pretty good. And I live in a rainy climate, and no ""DEW"" message, or any other have ever popped up. For the price, size, functions and final results. TV hook up or to computer. I give it a Thumbs Up with out hesitation."
4,A Great Little Camera for the $$,"I had a sharp viewcam before, the vlnz100 and it was the worst piece of electronics I have ever owned. After a year I couldnt take it anymore and called sharp corporate who helped me by sending me this new camera the VLZ5u. So far this camera has been great. Super small design which I love, takes good video, decent still pics. I use it along with my Apple iMac computer and the iMovie program to create great professional style movies. As one of the other reviews says, the camera is not on the official Apple list of supported cameras, but I have had no problem yet with it. All and all, a good buy!"
1,Never buy this item!,"i purchased this item 1 year ago. Basically as soon as the 1 year warranty was up my camera began turning on, but shutting right back off. My camera like the others on this page also, came on with a ""DEW"" warning. I have made several attempts to have Sharp try and fix this problem to which they have basically told me they won't/can't do anything to help me. Trust me when I say I will NEVER buy another Sharp camcorder/camera after the way i was treated on this one. PS. I had only used the camera approx. 5 times...this was clearly a poor choice on my behalf that I will be sure not to make again!"
1,Sharp camcorders,"DO NOT BUY ANY SHARP PRODUCTS.I unfortunately own a Sharp VL-Z3U camcorder which has been rendered useless by an ongoing DEW error (I store the camcorder in my family room and live in Michigan - not humid enough to justify this problem).After speaking with Sharp's customer relations, they informed me they no longer make camcorders and can do NOTHING for me. They obviously stopped making camcorders because they were not good at it. The cust rep was also VERY RUDE to me and sealed my decision to NEVER BUY ANOTHER SHARP PRODUCT AGAIN.My Sony camcorder still works after several years - I just bought the Sharp to upgrade to digital tapes (it died in only 16 months)."
1,DEW problem,"I bought one of these cameras and it worked great at first. But a week or 2 after the warranty expried, I started getting a DEW detection error. It would go away occasionally but always comes back. Sharp wanted $140 to try to fix it. After a serach of the web I found others who were having the same type of problem. I would certainly steer away from this product."
1,Memories lost!,"We got this camera a few months ago and never used until we finally had some special occassions to record. We were able to record two and on my daughter's 8th birthday party it came up with the DEW error and we tried very hard to get it back to normal. We left the cassette door open for days and no change. Do not buy this camera, it will take away from your special occassion when you least expect it. This electronic device is not worthy. I gave it one star because there isn't a lower rating."
5,One of the better looking digital watches,"I had looked at the similar Casio digital models, but this Timex had the best appearance to me.Many of the digital watches have a sort of cheesy or toy-like look to them, but not this one.I wanted a work watch that displayed the month and day,...and that was lightweight also. The setting modes are straight forward too,...I like that. I switched the watchband to a Timex Expedition Fast Wrap and it's perfect. Talk about comfortable. Keeps perfect time,...and oh yes, the green tint of the display when you angle it towards any light is exotic looking. The night light illuminates the dial nicely too."
4,Timex watch,"It's a plain ol' digital watch, with timer functions and a few other features. It works well for me and I like it. My old one wore out and I was pleasantly surprised to find the same watch. I bought it again without hesitation."
3,Could have been better,"The row with the month and day is tucked much too close to the top of the LCD window. As a result, under certain lighting conditions, the top segment of the digits becomes obscured. Example: you can't tell whether you're looking at a ""1"" or a ""7"".The functionality feature set and the settings mode are average.The main thing going for this watch is INDIGLO."
2,Mediocre,"I was disappointed in Scrap Quilts from the Depression. I hoped for more block style quilts and instead the majority of quilts seem to be 'flower' appliqué-type quilts or rather simple block patterns. The quilts themselves look lumpy in the photos and frankly, I didn't feel very inspired to make any of the quilts represented here.I've seen better books on Depression style quilts such as the Aunt Grace series. Save yourself the money and look elsewhere or peruse in the store before buying."
2,no go,"Of the fifty entries in this book I found only ten of them worth reading. The poetry is meaningless, the stories poorly written and boring."
5,Excellent book,"This book was very informative. I wish it was on the coffee table of every home in America. (whether they have a dog or not)I started off dog earing the corner of every page that had important info, by the time I finished reading the book EVERY page was dog eared.This book tells it all, with professional references for the info. I wish she would write the same book with a baby on the cover, Titled What Dr don't tell you about Vaccines so parents would be informed.I would Definitely recommend this book, and I already have, to everyone I know."
5,Listen to this man,"I myself think Dr. Ornish is the greatest. I recently became a vegetarian, sometimes I eat fish, so I guess I am only a semi-vegetarian. Dr. Atkins diet put me in the hospital literally for a week, my cholestrol was sky high, I had no energy and was fat as a pig. I have been following Dr. Ornish plan for 1 month and have already lost 12 pounds and feel great. I have no more migraine headaches, or any of the other ailments that used to bother me. Follow this book and it will help you to."
1,Title should be how to become a rabbit,"I'm sorry, this book is not for those how still like to get their protien by the source of meat. This book is not geered toward tracking weight loss and fitness. Its a complete book on extravagant veggie meals to make without using meat. I guess if I wanted to eat vegetable soup almost everyday, it would work for me. For those of you who want to eat like a ""normal person"", do not buy this book for weight loss. If you are not committed to becoming a vegetarian, this book is not for you."
2,"Beans and Carrots and Tofu, Oh My!","When I first picked up this book I was thrilled. I didn't want a book on some fad diet, but rather one that would help me eat better as I lost a few pounds. Unfortunately, this book represents the extreme opposite of the over-portioned, transfatty'd, fast food causing people so many problems with their health. Hasn't the author heard of moderation? Be warned, the recipes and philosophy of this book is really counter to the eating habits of most people - and you can pretty much give up ever eating out again, most restaurants don't serve the requirements of this plan. I lasted only a few weeks, then I was done with the bland sameness of it all, relenting to a friend's insistence that I try Atkins - success at last!"
5,Sound plan for going thin,"This book has a lot of encouraging words, education and wealth in understanding the steps to weight loss. Recipes are doable"
4,Good book,"Haven't finished reading it, but so far I am pleased with what I have read. I imagine that the balance of the book will be just as good as the beginning."
3,"Great theory of low-fat benefits, terrible recipes","I read this book just recently. I am convinced Ornish is on the right track for losing weight and keeping your heart healthy. He basically advocates a very low fat diet, using natural foods, avoiding meat and highly processed foods such as sugar, white flour, and white rice. Except for his completely wanting to avoid meat, I agree with him. I think some light use of lean meats should be included.What I was not please with were the recipes. I did not find one recipe that I could call quick and easy! Most involved many obscure ingredients and lots of preperation time.Read the book for it's ideas, then go out and look for other more practical low fat ""heart healthy"" cook books."
1,Another low-fat brain-washing book endorced by USDA,"I made a mistake of buying this book. I thought it was about healthy choices and eating well. But again, it's all the same brainwashing idea about eating low-fat, high-carb, eating lots of food that will raise your triglycerides, raise your blood sugar levels and cause you gain weight.Eat lost of pasta and bread and lose weight? Are you kidding me?What a waste of money! I don't want even to keep this book at my home, it is just producing negative thoughts. Garbage!"
2,Little meat to this book,"Here's the message: low-fat vegetarian. This book of almost 400 pages gives only 100 pages of discussion to weight-related issues, some of which teaches you to meditate. The rest is recipes that few of us would care to deal with on a daily basis. There is little substantiation to his theories and no discussion of the need for adequate protein."
2,eat more weigh less,This book is too drastic for me. I have to watch what I eat but this book is too much
3,Better than some diet books,"Dr. Ornish's book is a nice supplement to my usual diet approach, but a bit too extreme to follow completely. Has some good tips. A few of the recipes are good, but most are simply too complex for me to make on a regular basis. The next edition of the book could use a chapter on the economic and social reasons for the sedentary lifestyle and obesity usual in the U.S. We pay huge amounts of tax money for highways, but not for sidewalks. Agricultural subsidies see to it that meat, sugar, and corn syrup are unnaturally cheap. Zoning laws in most places prohibit the building of walkable neighborhoods. The misguided do-gooders who run the campaign to protect kids from sexual predators have made walking to school a rarity. Dr. Ornish seems to think that our lack of exercise and poor eating habits are personal failings, to be overcome by a decent eating program. That is simply not so."
5,Fantastic Book,This book is a potential life changer. Dr. Ornish reveals how to lose weight and enjoy good food at the same time!
5,Revive your sex life!,After being married for 13 years my sex life was not the priortity it once was. Having just read this book things in the bedroom have become HOT HOT HOT! My husband is rejuvenated and more productive than ever! An excellent book to get things in the bedroom back on track!
1,There is nothing new ......,I got this book so that I could spice up my sex life....but....I already knew everything that was already in this book...so it was very disappointing....
1,This is Ridiculous,"I purchased this book hoping to surprise my husband some evening. I read a few pages and then leafed quickly through the book. Simply put, it is soft porn. There is very little instruction - unless you call exploits ( written a bit too professionally for these so-called ""candid women"") instruction. No, I have not read the entire book. It is hard to tell one page from the others. The lowest rating possible is one star - this book does not come up to meet the scale. As I do not want porn in my house, I have burned the book. Unless you have matches nearby, don't waste your money."
1,Waste of time,The book is not worth reading. Title is misleading waste of money. It describes others sexploites. Waste of time and money.
2,Pornographic but Redeeming,"My earlier review of this book has changed due to the fact I don't feel it(review) was fully responsible. While I personally was able to handle this book which is in no way medical, but rather uses street slang and extremely graphic depictions, I previously neglected to warn the reader it easily could be considered pornography, thus, as a Christian, viewing pornography is not something I should be promoting. As with all of Masterton's books, I think the the potential reader would make a more informed choice by paging through one of his books first, then making up their own mind. As for me, I found some use and enjoyment in it, but then again, pornography has no lure for me. Buy at your own discretion."
2,"OK, But Not Academic","This video was interesting, but its laughable to anyone who wants hard evidence or any sort of academic evidence. The two segments on individuals who believe they are aliens is almost hysterical, and in the end leaves you wondering if you have been duped into purchasing junk."
4,A Tour of Ufology,"A Tour of Ufology :from meeting aubductee Whitley Strieber whom the medical professionals have cleared as being sane and competent.To the Pages, brother and sister claiming to be hybrid alien/human offspring from secret government experiments. Medical tests find some interesting unexplainable anomalies to their physiology.You also get a tour of Bob Brown's Annual UFO Conference.Plus an interview with Sheldon Niles Earths Emissary in the Galactic Federation.Good Introduction to these folks."
1,Not worth the price,"This is a very disappointing DVD for $18. It is the 1956 one-hour documentary narrated by Alexander Scoursby.Done in the same style as ""Victory At Sea"", it must have been good for its time. Still, much of the short hour was spent showing Americans partying on their way to the war and partying on their way back home. Very little was spent on the causes of the war and nothing was said of the Versailles Treaty.If you are interested in WW-I, I suggest you wait for PBS to issue its 1996 6-hour series of the same name. When it does, I'll buy their DVD and donate this one to the local library."
1,"big money, big name, big disappointment!",I bought this digital camera thinking it would be very compatable with my photosmart printer. It was compatable. But I can't afford to keep the thing in batteries. I was unable to find the dock in any area store and finally ordered it on line. I hope that will help. but this camera only takes a few pictures until low battery signal appears.
5,My son's favorite,"This toy has not broken in 3+ weeks, and it my 8 year old son's favorite beyblade so far. I had to assemble it for him as I do most of the beyblades, but that's okay."
2,bunch of dump,"This blade [is not good], I battled it with my worst blade (gekiryu-oh <- first blade) and i some how won, (the kid was [angry] and he wanted to battle me every time)...the blade base is good (its the same as master dragoon)...weight disk ok good, good enough...attack ring totaly [is not good]...and this blade is good for one thing and that is decoration, dont buy it, becuase it would be a bey blade shame( buy wolborg #1 or wolborg #2<- two of the best blades ever made)"
5,Seaborg 2: Totally Cool,Whoa! What a blade! This blade rules. It is huge. It beats most smaller blades. When you have a stadium you'll really rock.
4,SeaBorg 2,This blade is pretty good. Base is good if you sand it flatter and smaller. The attack ring stinks though yet it might look good. Get Wyborg insted!! Worth all money
2,Stick To TheMalamutes,"As I have read and loved every Mystery written by Susan Conant, I was very disappointed by her participationin this trite, albeit ""titillating"" endeavor. Please Mrs. Conant, do give your loyal fans more of the books in thegenre that we have come to anticipate. My son was the loving owner of a big, beautiful Malamute. He boughtthis dog at my urging, and Kobi was loved by everyone who ever came in contact with him. Sadly, Kobi died afew months ago at the age of 6 1/2 from Bone Cancer. Please more about Kimi, Rowdy and Sammy!!"
3,She needs to practice what she preaches,"Spandel has done her homework and has used the trait system extensively in her classroom, which gives her much credibility. However, a well-organized reference book puts all the information about one topic in one place. Unfortunately, information about each of the traits is scattered around the book, making it extremely annoying. I'm sure she could have done better, and we all hope a new edition will prove she can even use the trait of organization herself. Let's practice what we preach."
1,Nonsense,"The Heart of the World is writing in search of a book. And it never comes together. Furthermore, most of characters and anecdotes seem totally fictional (there's really no way of verifying anything), although this is supposed to be nonfiction. Nik Cohn may be a gifted writer, but this so-called book is a disaster."
1,"Awful, except 2 songs","I don't know how the other reviewers can even listen to this - it is awful. I am a big fan of music and listen to a huge variety of genres (rock, soft rock, jazz, classical, folk, easy listening, etc) so I think I know good music. I really do not even know how to describe most of the music on this CD. Other than 2 versions of ""Happy Ever After"" - which is a very good song - the other songs are mostly just really bad. Ok, one other song - Where Does The Time Go? - is average. But it is hard to listen to the other songs without feeling a strong urge to hit the next button.I would give this zero stars - or better yet, negative stars - if I could do so."
4,i love her songs,"i've been listening to her music especially love moves in mysterios ways, and it is amazing to know that there's a site where i can find more of her music."
5,"Ethnic Variations in Dying, Death, and Grief Diversity in Universality","Excellent book for someone who is interested in the different religious cultures regarding death and dying. I am a nurse who is pursuing palliative care/hospice. As a nurse, social worker, or someone who works with dealing with various cultures, you encounter individuals with different religious beliefs. This is a great overview to help you understand different rituals and beliefs that you might encounter in your practice and how to accommodate the grieving families during this difficult time."
3,Tedious,"You MUST be interested in the Nazi era to a radical degree to stick with this book. It is a left-nostril account of nuances of negotiations, mainly regarding Swiss and German reparations, mainly for Jewish Holocaust survivors. Complicating the reading effort are grammatical errors (see, for example, page 198) and some apparent scholarship inconsistencies. (To illustrate, contrast discussion in next to the last paragraph on page 206 with descriptive matter associated with the first photograph on the sixth page of photographs.) Moreover, in my view, the book is as much about its author's sense of self-importance as it is about the negotiation process it describes."
3,Hard to see the forest for the trees,"Former Ambassador Stuart Eizenstat is a man of great moral conviction and political savvy. He epitomizes what it means to be a true public servant. His passion for justice comes through very clearly in this book. Historians of the Clinton administration and of Europe's response to the Holocaust will find this book invaluable.That said, I found this book quite difficult to read. Eizenstat's blow-by-blow descriptions of the seemingly endless negotiations lack dramatic structure and are far too detailed for a book intended for the general reader. When Eizenstat looks at the big picture -- the differing political cultures of France and the United States, the Austrians' cramped apologetics for their role in the Holocaust -- he is convincing. But far too much of this book feels as if it's written by a lawyer for other lawyers. It needed an editor who could get past Eizenstat's note cards and create a real narrative."
2,not exactly....,"I returned the set after trying out the hands-free and charger adaptors. The hands-free adaptor has an earpiece that does not stay on my ear and does not hold the speaker tightly to the ear. The charger charges well enough, but not like the Motorola. With this one, the phone light stays on constantly while the charger is plugged in. I don't know if this is a problem, but I decided not to find out. I didn't try the vent clip attacher; it requires ""permanently"" sticking a piece to the phone--something I didn't want to do. Maybe I expected too much: 100% compatibility."
2,OK but not that great,"You can definitely tell the author is a typical mechanic after reading this (minor problems seem exaggerated and the estimates for repairs are so outrageous they are scary, plus he makes the point clear that any kind of repair work should be left to experts like him). After reading this, you wonder why anybody would buy a Porsche. I will look at some other books before I make my decision. Also did not find much technical specs of the different models, which is what I was interested in, like weight, horsepower, performance, etc."
3,A novel with every war-time cliche,"When I first started reading this book, I didn't read the cover carefully and thought it was a true WWII story! I was really disappointed when I figured out its a novel. It started to seem very contrived. I like the basic story, but how all the characters come together at the end of the book is very silly and not believable. I agree with other reviewers that the best parts are those in WWII Germany. I started skipping over the chapters that take place in the 1990s in Minnesota. It made the book too long and clunky to keep switching back and forth between these time periods."
2,How the other side coped,"I was disappointed in this book. The dialogue was stilted, the plot relied to heavily on coincidence, the pacing was off, and characters were too unidimentional. Great idea, though. I believe this is a first novel; perhaps subsequent efforts will be better."
1,A dissenting opinion,"When our book group reviewed this novel, we were deeply divided. I really did not like the book, actually disliked it. I didn't like any of the characters. I liked the daughter least. It took me a long time to get through it. I did not think I learned anything important or new about this period of time from anyone's point of view, and while the themes covered are critically important, there are other novels of this period that do so more effecively for me. This was just bleak and felt manipulative."
1,Overloaded Sexual Content,"This novel seemed to borrow from Schindler's List, the Pianist, and a cheesy Danielle Steele novel I read when I was 14 - all of which were better stories than ""Those Who Save Us."" There was an unnecessary focus on the perverse SS officer's sexual offenses, which stole focus from the modern interviews of surviviors, which could have offered what the author intended - some explanation as to how the ""everyday"" German citizen could have watched the Holocaust happen in their own backyard."
2,Those Who Save Us,"My enjoyment of this excellent book was marred by the poor quality of the conversion from the original print to the format of the ebook. There was almost no punctuation and it was full of typos and other errors. This was a sloppy piece of work, to say the least. As it was my first purchase and my introduction to the Kindle, the shortcomings came as a shock. I assumed that all books to follow might exhibit similar flaws. However, this has not been the case. The Kindle experience has brought me much joy and its books are for the most part very well presented.Lila Pascal"
2,Those Who Save Us,"Good idea for a book although poorly executed. Too many coincidences I the end. The daughter has to be one of the least self aware characters I have ever read. I would give it A for effort but I found it tedious and was glad when it was finished. I was always aware I was reading a book and never ""felt"" the story in my bones. There are many many better WWII books out there."
3,good book,"starting off really really slowly hope it gets more interesting... the topic in itself is incredible ,,, just reading on"
3,What would you do to save a child?,"I bought this book knowing that it was about an adult teacher searching for answers to events in her childhood at the time of Hilter's rule of terror. Her main concern is the actions of her German mother who will answer no questions. She is determined to find out why so many Germans stood by while Jews were being persecuted.Of course her mother became involved with a Nazi and the relationship between the two was pretty disgusting when sexual activites are involved. For me, there was a little too much information.The end of the book was a fairly sudden turn of events. It was too sudden I think. Perhaps a little of the story should have been a little shorter so the end could have been built up a little better.Because I could not put the book down, I probably should give it 4 stars. Even if I had known about the way the book ended I still would have read it."
4,Good read,"Super slow to get started ... was probably about halfway through the book before it really got going and caught my interest. However, I'm not one to usually quit a book halfway through. By the end, I really liked the story, just wish it would have picked up the pace a little earlier."
4,Good read. Thought provoking.,Great story depicting WWII and the affect it had on the villagers living in Germany. Loved the way the author alternated between generations.
4,Those Who Save Us review,This book was an interesting read. A new point of view on the Holocaust experience. I would recommend this book to a reader that enjoys historical fiction or likes a story with twists and turns.
1,Really not my kind of book,"This book has some very annoying aspects to it. First, the lack of quotation marks makes it hard to decipher who exactly is talking, and whether or not someone is actually talking or if it's just thoughts/narration going on. Next, the switching back and forth between 1996 and 1940 usually does not bother me, but the 1996 story was soooooo trite and boring I just wanted to skip over it to the 1940s part. The way the author describes college students is horrid! As a graduate student myself, I know for a fact that most college students do not say the word ""like"" multiple times throughout every sentence. ""Hi Professor, can I like, talk to you, like, for a minute? I am having some trouble, like, understanding the material."" Uggghh, that is when I stopped reading. Also, the characters are really under developed. This book is not to be tossed aside lightly, it should be thrown across the room with great force."
3,"Good, but sexually explicit","I was prepared for disturbing images regarding Nazi Germany before reading this book. However, I was not pepared for all of the explicit sexual detail of the storyline. It as a moving story of a young women doing what was neccessary to ensure that she and her small child survived WWII in Germany. I wish I would have been warned of the disturbing images of her forced, sexual relationshp with a Nazi soldier."
4,Those who save us -,"Creatively written, I enjoyed the way she took us from past to present and then merged the two. I agree with the other reviewers, it's not often you see a book that makes your realize what some Germans might have gone through to save themselves as well as save Jewish neighbors and friends. recommended !"
5,Beautiful and Heroic Story,"This was a beautifully told story of human courage, love, and endurance in a horribly cruel chapter of history."
5,Great Book,A friend recommended this book to me because my mother is German. I now understand a little better how this affected the people in Germany during this horrible time. I recommend it to anyone who is at all curious about this time in History.
5,"Good book, emotionaly good story!!!","Although it took me a while to really get into the story, I did think it was a good read. I certainly wanted to know how it ended and it was different reading a story about the Holocaust from a another point of view...Worth while reading, most certainly!"
1,Disgusting and Disturbing!,This is the most disgusting and disturbing book I have ever read. At least 50% of the book is explicit descriptions of the rape and sexual abuse of a Nazi soldier to a German mom. The sex and rape is described over and over in the most unnecessarily detailed descriptions. It will leave you feeling violated and disturbed. The unending focus on sex was way over the top and totally unnecessary!
3,"potential 5 star, but died in the end","Great story line! The author went back and forth between the 1940's and present very well; I defintely wanted to keep reading. What kept this from being a 5-star for me are several issures. First, too much detail in the sex scenes, not neccessary for the development of Anna's character or her relationship with the SS officer. Second, the character development in the end is disappointing. I would have liked to find out more why Trudy turned out as she did. Her brief fling with Rainer had no purpose, don't know why it was written in. IN the end, when the truth starts to come out about all Anna went through, I would have liked to read about how Anna, Trudy, Felix all deal with it. Instead the book ends; unfortunate, disappointing."
3,Those Who Save Us,It is an interesting book but sometimes very slow moving. It was graphic in places so it gives a true picture of life in Germany during W.W.II. Glad I read it and paid a reasonable price.
1,Ruined,"I thought this book was an interesting slant on Holocaust life. I almost did NOT read it due to the totally unnecessary graphic sexual details. The book would have been much better without that garbage. Many people were caught in the middle and had to survive however they could. There are still those who cannot talk about it. My heart goes out to the Jews who suffered the most, but also to many Germans who had no choice but to obey or be killed. In my opinion, there are much better books to read that are real stories, not fabricated, pieced together half-truths."
2,"Compelling, but contrived","It's a captivating Holocaust story, a page-turner. Ultimately not really believeable, with too many coincidences. If my book group proposes it, I'm going to vote against it; I certainly don't want to read it again. If you read it and feel dirty afterward, remember that you were warned."
3,Those who save us,"A very interesting story of the things people are willing to go through to survive and save their children. Also, the way each of those of different generations remember the history of the family.Uncandhildi@gmail"
2,This author has never lived in Minnesota!,"This book was heartily recommended to me by a fellow traveler on an airplane to Minneapolis, of all places!! I eagerly anticipated its arrival and read it in an afternoon--stretched into late evening. Once I'd read the part describing the funeral in Minnesota, I really couldn't believe much about the rest of the book. I know it's a work of fiction, but if the facts with which I am familiar are so far out in left field, why should I think the rest of the book is based on the fact that it purports to be based on the Holocaust? Minnesota people are, to a fault, polite. The book did have a lot of promise and was well written, but the writer has an over-active imagination...or neglected to do even the most basic of research. I could probably write an equally good Holocaust novel, and I'm a baby boomer from Canada!!"
2,Very disturbing sex content:,"I read the whole book. The story was very strong, sad and heartwarming, but I think the Author could of toned down the violent sex between Anna and the SS officer. That really turned me off on really liking the book. I would not recommend this book to someone with a sensitive stomach to buy this book."
1,Ugggggggggggggg!,"Okay seriously, how much is the author compensating the reviewers to report positively about what any reasonable person would deem a complete waste of time. The writing style of this book was horrid and it was pieced together rather shoddily. Thank god I borrowed this from a friend, if only I could have the hours of my life back that were stolen from me."
1,Not well written,"Interesting story we have heard before. Annoyingly written, and really needs editing. Inaccuracies regarding certain facts related to Holocaust."
1,"Good idea, but poorly executed","I had trouble getting through this book--not because of the subject matter, which is heavy and could be too much for some--but because of the writing. It's so awkward. The character development is poor, the dialogue is weak, and the sex--not just between Anna and the officer, but throughout the book--is overkill. Such heavy material requires better writing."
1,Creepy Unrealistic over-detailed rape scenes,"The character in the book has a forced sexual relationship with a Nazi soldier who is an abusive creep. Yet, despite the fact that this guy killed her best friend, AND he is raping her on a regular basis, she is unable to stop herself from having orgasms and moaning in uncontrollable pleasure? Really? It reads more like a rape fantasy fiction in some magazine rather than a novel. If the author wanted to somehow convey that this woman who had a controlling emotionally abusive father can only love a man who is also abusive, you can certainly convey that point without having multiple very detailed rape scenes where the rape victim is (are we supposed to believe this is even possible?) having orgasms in spite of not wanting to. Please don't foist rape fantasy fiction on unsuspecting readers when they thought they were just going to be reading a regular novel."
5,Outstanding!,"With exceptional writing skill and the gift of bona fide storytelling, Jenna Blum drew me into her compelling historical novel from the very beginning. I was, in a word, captivated. Strength, love, courage, sacrifice, and unspeakable pain are all themes in this unforgettable book, and each is addressed with a deft hand and open heart. THOSE WHO SAVE US is unlike any Holocaust story I've read, and the raw emotions it evoked within me were powerful and long-lasting. The sheer weight of the story coupled with the sensitivity given to the characters was masterful. I can't recommend it highly enough."
5,A great read!,"It's surprising that this is Jenna Blum's first novel. It will be a hard act to follow for her. From storyline, style and use of vocabularly this book is a winner. It is a first rate page turner that I have recommended to many people & all have thanked me."
2,"Good story, bad writing","This book suffers from a general problem with today's fiction writing: too much time spent at writing workshops. I could not get past the overworked prose to enjoy the excellent story to it fullest. The writing is very stilted and inorganic and causes one to ask the writer to put down the gosh darn thesaurus and just let it flow! David Wroblewski's Edgar Sawtelle suffers from this illness, too: a great story marred by strained writing."
1,Depressing and lacking,"Lacking. The lack of quotations around the dialogue wasn't the only thing missing. Missing from this book were characters behaving in accordance with their character. The biggest character inconsistency being Max. Max would not have gotten Anna pregnant nor would he have hidden in her stairwell and put her in danger.Depressing. I can honestly say that this is the most depressing book I have ever read. What a sad and miserable life for Anna. She prostituted herself for her and her daughter to live (first with the Nazi and then the farmer) and for all her sacrifice, her daughter doesn't even love/know/understand/want to spend time with her. It's a sad and miserable life for Trudie as well. Fifty years old and pretty much alone."
4,Drop off,This was a very well written book bringing in so many different lives during the war. I only wish it hadn't left us hanging so much at the end...
3,Wartime Saga,"This book was a big surprise in that it was explicit about wartime survival and the methods some people used to survive. The book is fiction although the facts surrounding the difficulties and conditions are true. I would recommend this read to the hearty ones who want to try to understand the reason for decisions made to in order to survive and the reasoning behind these decisions. My feelings about the explicit wording leaves one to wonder if this was a necessary part of the book to make it more believeable; is it too sexually explicit to make it a great read? If one is into visually explicit situations, then this book is one to read. If one is trying to expand ones knowledge about the events of this tragic event in history, then try to overlook the numerous details given to the sexuality tactics used by this woman in order to secure survival for her and her young daughter. I would recommend this book for the historical value."
4,Powerful and admirable,"To say I greatly enjoyed ""Those Who Save Us"" seems wrong because of the horrific subject matter. But Jenna Blum created two strong female characters who, from the start, I felt compelled to follow along in their journey of discovery and survival. I loved how the two timelines were woven together and how the daughter's dreams echoed what she was starting to remember about her childhood. The Obersturmfubrer was one of the scariest characters I've ever encountered and, given all the research Blum did beforehand, I'm certain he is representative of some of the monsters of that time.The writing is beautiful. One example: ""She embroiders and rehearses overheard conversations for Max, hoping to be rewarded by his barking laugh; she lays anecdotes at his feet like treasure.""Marie Estorgeauthor of CONFESSIONS OF A BI-POLAR MARDI GRAS QUEENand STORKBITES: A MEMOIR"
5,Those Who Save Us,"Very good book... start to finish. Funny at times, very sad and heartbreaking at others. Once I started reading I could put the book down."
3,Great book-,I'm the type of reader who needs to be sucked in to a book immediately and those who save us did just that. I do enjoy this genre and sometimes books dealing with the subject of the holocaust can be very difficult to read. This book did have its tear jerking moments but was overall not as sad as many others I have read. I liked the way the nook went between past and present and was interested in each character and thier storyline. Great read!
4,"Liked it, but was frustrated","I really liked the alternate perspective offered in this book. At first I found the back and forth from present day US to war-time Germany distracting, but I quickly adjusted. I found myself anxious to get back to Germany when the story lingered too long in the present day and I was never really sure whether I liked Trudy (the main present-day character). Then again, I really didn't like Anna, (the main character in the war-time part of the story) when the book focused on present day. In Germany, Anna was in an impossible situation - one that is easy not to consider when thinking about the German bystanders of the war. Her story really makes you think about the choices people had to make - if there were even choices available. My main complaint is the way Anna treated her daughter Trudy in present-day America, but her behavior is the result of her own experience and that's all part of what Blum wants us to think about. I definitely recommend this book."
5,VERY INSIGHTFUL BOOK,"I thought that this book gave the reader a lot to think about. This was a different perspective and I appreciated the things that it made me think about and it certainly makes me grateful for the life I have compared to what so many people went through. What a difficult, horrid period in our history.I think the author did a great job with a very difficult subject! It really keeps your attention!"
5,A Stunner.,"Those Who Save Us was recommended to me by the cover! I hate to admit it, but I bought this book because of the cover design,which used what I believe to be several old photos combined to look like one. I can't say enough about Ms. Blum's accomplishment in writing this book. It was absolutely gripping from beginning to end and the characters remain with me. Ms. Blum's imagination in creating characters and their shared dialogue is wonderful. She never allows an inappropriate sentimental reaction in word or deed; these people are drawn as tough as life and while decent motives exist and are acted upon, those too can cause unitended, sometimes awful, consequences. This is truly an adult examination of motive and circumstance.Thank you, Ms. Blum and I look forward to your next book."
3,"Interesting, but similar to Winter Garden","It was ok. It made you look at things from a different point of view. The end was annoying how Anna tried to keep everyone in the dark about what happened and it lead to misunderstandings. The mother daughter theme reminded me of the book ""the Winter Garden""."
4,Those who save us,Great read. I bought this book for a book club and everyone loved it. Easy to read but yet nice historical facts mixed with fiction.
3,Interesting read.,"I enjoyed 75 percent of the story. The part of the story that I found redunant was the main character's experience of forced sex. One or two chapters would have been enough, but instead the author continued this topic in many chapters."
2,Not impressed,"The premise of this book sounded intriguing - the things that people will do to survive - but the delivery falls short. The story was difficult to follow, and as others have mentioned, failed to keep my interest. I wish that I would have checked this book out from the library rather than paying for it on the Kindle."
4,Historical fiction at it's best!,"Loved this book immediatley! I loved the author's use of the german words thrown into the story, it gave the book a more authentic feel. Fantastic work of historical fiction, I didn't want it to end."
4,Quotation marks please!,"I have to say that I agree with what all the other reviewers of this book had to say. It was a great book and well researched. I have conducted oral history interviews myself and you can tell in the reading that she had done this herself and knew what she was talking about. I found it very compelling and had a hard time putting the book down to do unimportant things, like eating and sleeping.The one thing I didn't like about the book, that drove me absolutely nuts, is the fact that she didn't use quotation marks to show when a character was speaking. For me this made the dialogue lose the emotional impact it would have had otherwise."
5,Great story,"This was a wonderfully written and moving story about the results of the Holocaust without ever being sentimental or sappy. I am buying a copy for my mom, who is a decerning reader."
5,"GREAT, GREAT","Once I opened this book I did not want to put it down. GREAT read, great book. I havent found a book this good in awhile. Def gave me a different insight to world war II . I never bothered to look into what the German people had to struggle with during this time. I really enjoyed this book."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Magic as psionics, with special effects, along with the politics, power structures and intrigue that goes along with it. In opposition, masters of technology. An untrained sorceror is a 'Madwand'.That is not all that exists in this particular world, it is a lot more complicated than that."
1,Wow. Can literature get much worse?,"I have one thing to say, and it is a direct quote from this book:""[The Harpy] flapped in quick patrol about the cavern, defecating profusely, imaginatively.""This book is one of the funniest things I've read in a long time. Unfortunately, it isn't meant to be. If you want to read it, get it for free at a library. DO NOT PAY FOR IT OR SATAN WILL OWN YOUR SOUL!"
2,"Concise, but...","This book is a little to concise. It only gives the bare bones basics. So if you're a novice, it's a good handbook. If not, it's not worth the money, in particular if you do computerised notation."
2,Softgels Suck,"I buy a lot of Nature Made products but, don't recommend softgels. As a trucker, the products are exposed to different temperatures and if these softgels get to warm they melt together and are hard to seperate and get out of the bottle. I recommend sticking with Nature Made classic pills."
5,Wild Flower Identification,I have not found a wild flower that I can not identify using this book. I highly recommend this to anyone that wants to know what that pretty flower by the road is
2,no picture on front of book,"The picture indicates that the front cover of the book has pictures of Yellow Daffodils in bloom. WHen the book arrived, it is just a green cover with the words Wildflowers of Arkansas. Sure wouldn't have ordered it if the front cover didnt have pictures.. Disappointed!!!!!! It was a gift..."
2,not a good toy,"This doll was small and made of really thin plastic. My child did not seem to like it, and it is not very pretty in person."
4,Aferican American,"Yes this is better than the normal (white) version. I prefer this over the ""wigger"" version that i previously owned(...). The black one mkes me more""happy"""
1,Not Worth the money,"I like reading romance novels, and this is the worse one i have read so far. The plot is thin, actual non existent, the main characters have no personality what so ever. The male at least has an agenda at hand, a lousy non realistic one, the female is a perfect play of a ""Blonde Ditz"". The two have nothing in common and it is a wonder that they ever even felt something for one another. The story is unrealistic and is very childish. The plot consists of only - or at least mainly- sex. It is a shame that a good plot idea, was portrayed in such a bad way. The book is good for an flight or train ride, but don't expect to be remembering it and reading it over and over again. There are a lot of books on the market with the same idea, read them, pass this one."
1,Nonexistent plot and bad writing,"If you like cardboard characters, unnatural dialogue, and just plain bad writing, you'll love this turkey. Otherwise, don't waste your money."

2,Don't Bother,Karen Kay's books have been some of my favorites but this one is not worth the trouble. I can't believe that the woman who wrote Lakota Surrender and Proud Wolf's Woman wrote this. The hero is annoying and the heroine is even worse. The only part of the book that made the effort to read it worth while is the segment in which the heroine's mother doles out advice like a 19th Century western frontier sex therapist. At least I got a good laugh from that. If you want to read better books try the two I mentioned in the second sentence.
5,Wolf Shadow's Promise,Well written novel. I REALLY GOOD Loving book. Inspiration for more people to read about Native Americans. The only one that has been a great writer.
5,I couldn't put this book down,"I'm writing this review because I want to tell Ms. Kay how much I enjoy reading her books! When I was reading this book, I felt like I was in the story -- like I was living it. Once I had started to read it, I couldn't put it down! I had to force myself. (Ha! Ha!)I highly recommend this book. Oh, so romantic."
4,Help for the Abused,"In reading your book I was encouraged because it shows that there is help out there if the abuse is open. Most of the abuse I have been in contact, as a nurse has been hidden until a child comes to a hospital and suspected abuse is there. We need to get the message out so others may also obtain help. Being April is Abuse Month it is being openly recognized which is helpful. Thank you for your story and information. Shirley Kalpin Olson author of ""The Truth Shall Set You Free"" and ""Train Wreck in the Sierras"" also ""Life After Death"" coming to Amazon in the near future."
2,not what I expected,"I burned about 75 of the 100 in the spindle and about 2o were defective in some way, most not not advancing from one tract to another. I will be looking for other brands next time I purchase, even if more costly. I have some Staples brand CD's which seem to be about as good a quality but cheaper. I have a 6mo. old Dell E-310 computer. It should not be a computer problem so I have to attribute the problem to the CD's."
3,somewhat juvenile,"I was looking for more of a ""field guide,"" and what I ended up with was what looks to me to be a childs picture book. The descriptions of the birds are simplistic: ""Grouse are like jumbo-sized quail with broad, turkey-like tails."" Types of birds are listed alphabetically rather than by type. Photographs are large and full color, with many taking up 1/4 to 1/2 of the page. I would recommend the book for older children (maybe 7-12ish?) but not for anyone looking for more scientific information on our avian friends."
3,Cheap basic mouth guard...,"Mouth pieces are cheap, I guess the cost is low for a reason. They don't really mold good at all and in fact, one of the mouth pieces we had to throw away because after boiling it for the 7 seconds it said on the directions, the mouth piece was rough and wrinkled. We did three of them so we'd have some extras and the other 2 did not do that and turned out ok. But, still just a very basic cheap mouth guard. Can't say I'd recommend it."
5,Great fun for a short time!,What fun! A friend and I assembled this puzzle while dinner was in the oven. The pieces were bigger and easier to spot so the puzzle was easier to put together.
5,Wegman Puppies,"Wonderful calendar, I've been hanging them on my wall's for years!! The was incredible. I received the calendar in two days !! Thank you."
4,Wegman Delights with His Puppies yet again...,One of the greatest pop culture references of the late 1900's has to be William Wegman's puppies. These images resound with character and delighted me (and I'm a cat lover!).
2,Good product bad shipping and handling service,"I really like the calendar and the photos are great.However, the company shipped the calendar in a manila paper envelop, this cause the the corners of the calendar got badly damaged.At the end you get a bittersweet feeling because you like the photos and the calendar format but it's really annoying to have its corners damaged, especially because they are charging you shipping and handling."
2,Too Much of One Puppy,"I love puppies, don't get me wrong. But I am so glad I got to see every month of this calendar before I bought it. If you see the picture on the front of the calendar (which is adorable) you might as well turn out the light and go home. Its the same puppy throughout the calendar! A few months have what looks like a whole litter, but they all look exactly the same. An adult dog is in one picture, but it just looks like a bigger version of the same puppy. I would be bored stiff with this calendar by May or June.These puppies are cute, but please give me a little variety over a 12-month period."
5,William Wegman's Wonderful Weimeraners,"William Wegman is one of America's most important photographers,and Puppies is a wonderful,dear,sweet,happy and tragic book,all at the same time. Wegman's reputation may be in photography,but this beautiful book of photos proves that he is a great storyteller as well. Not only is it a picture book,it is a touching storybook of the lives of his beloved dogs. Sometimes that love gives me the creeps,but of course,I have never lived with dogs. Cats,on the other hand... A great book,get it!"
1,Can't read the dates from a distance,"I received this calendar as a gift, although I have been purchasing it myself for many years. In 2009 they changed the design of the calendar and made the print on the calendar portion much lighter than in previous years. The problem is that the layout and design, combined with the light pastel color ink, makes the calendar unreadable from more than two or three feet away. I have to put on my glasses and get within two feet of the calendar in order to read the date. The calendar is in a well-lit location.If you just want this calendar for the pictures, you will be pleased. If you want to see the date, you may want to consider a different calendar.I will not purchase this calendar again."
5,William Wegman's Puppy Calendar,"Great calendar--the puppies look sweet, and are posed in very different ways. This time there are no jarring poses. Fun to see hanging on the wall."
5,Ghost in the Shell: SAC does it again,"With the second season of Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex, Section 9 returns once again but this time their entire group has a different agenda. While in the first season dealing with the ""Laughing Man"", this season seems to take a little more serious tone compared to the first season. Once again they deal with terrorist, this time it's with a terrorist group calling themselves ""The Individual Eleven"" and trying to start what they call a 'revolution'. Not only that Section 9, also has to face with refugees that are resorting to suicide bombings to leave their last mark in the world. I say that the story writing got better for this season though at times its on par with the first season but for the most part it's better than the Season 1 writing. I definitely recommend this season of Ghost in the Shell for anyone that's a fan of the show let alone the movies. I give it a 5 stars out of 5."
4,Classic Anime Series!,Anyone who loves anime has probably seen this series at least once. It's good to have the complete series in one package. This is a must have series so get it now before the price goes up!
5,Ghost in the Shell: 2nd Gig,"Ghost in the Shell: Anime Legends 2nd Gig need I say more. I still think the laughing man was more interesting, but that;'s because I grew up being a big computer person and knew a few hackers, but this series definitely has the better soundtrack and visuals. The song Cyberbird by Yoko Kanno is amazing and they play it at the perfect times all throughout the series.I have watched this series twice now, going onto three and I'm still trying to peace together everything and make sense of it. If you ask me normally I would say that sucks for anything, but this series is so good that it's more enjoyable every time, and you figure out or see new things every time you re-watch it."
5,Under-rated Series,"For the past decade Sci-Fi animes have unfortunately his a plateau in regards to unique story execution and story development. GTS provides an unrivaled level of sophistication and class that keeps the series to appealing and riveting from the start. From many reviews that I've read about the series, many criticize the progression let alone the story; however, from shear deduction I concluded that these individuals perhaps didn't understand the complexities that the series provides. Its not for all, and its a definite must for the thought seekers."
3,Polish,"i bought this for both my son and i to learn because my husband is polish. my son (5) loves it, but it's not so great for me to learn. i'm more of a visual person, and this has a lot of audio, so i think it's just not for me. my son picked up words right away and uses them in daily conversation."
3,ok for kids or linguistically challenged and OVERPRICED,It would be a great product if the amount of material was more extensive. It is very basic but more than the most basic CD in the series (Talk now or the older version Speak&Learn Polish). It is pretty much for kids only or linguistically challenged. My 5 year old twin daughters have a lot of fun with it. The pronounciation is authentic and games are interesting for their age. I cannot imagine an adult doing it and keeping sanity. It is a reasonable starter but very basic and the vocabulary is extremely limited. For adults there is definitely more cost effective choices out there.
1,There are much better books,"I was in Cambridge when, looking at Heffers, I met this book. I was preparing a Harmony course merging Schönberg with Kostka/Payne, and I was looking for something practical and rich of examples; so the title kept my attention. Then I was called outside in a hurry, and without thinking very much, I bought the volume. What a mistake! First of all it is full of errors: from real ones (a major sixth doesn't have 8 semitones) to typographical (almost all the headnotes are wrong). Moreover terms and rules are absolutely non-standard. And, as a cherry on the cake, when, in the appendix, he tries to explain some ""Fundamentals of Acoustic, he reveals a great deal of ignorance, defining a logarithm base 10 (where he needed a logarithm base 2), confusing energy with amplitude, and giving vague explanations of the length of an instrument. Definitely, there are better books!"
3,Its ok,"Theory comes hard for me and so this book was ok for me. Some people are buying this book thinking its the textbook, it's not. This is the handbook to help."
5,That is a good book!!!,That is good a book to review harmonic points and have exercises to practice than!! You can understand all points whith Shenker analises!!!
1,This book sucks.,"I am a music major at Pepperdine University. Our professor chose this book for our theory classes. Even our professor, Mr. Lincoln Hanks (an acclaimed composer), mocks and ridicules this book because of it's impreciseness and unclarity. I warn you, do NOT buy this book. You will be SORELY disappointed!"
1,total rubbish,"I had hoped to see naked babes, since this is a Playboy production. Instead I saw (fairly ugly) men involved in slapstick comedy worthy of Japanese television. I actually threw the DVD in the trash."
3,Charting the End Times,"Truthfully it was not a whole lot of help, but the cost was reasonable. And it went along with our study group"
1,A waste of time for any student,"After reading this book, it is clear to me that Slone has many misunderstandings about the religions he discusses. He also shows a strong bias towards cognitive science, but that is understandable since it is he field of study. He uses cognitive science to try to explain things which don't need explaining, because most people already understand what he terms, ""Theological Incorrectness"". He brings no new information to the discussion, and adds a number of misunderstandings and falsehoods, and I think that this book is a hinderance to the very field of study which it was meant to benefit."
1,BEWARE: Quality has changed,"I bought these color cases at my retail workplace for the last couple years and most were pretty good. Only occasionally I would get some that didn't close tightly or CD wouldn't stay in.A few months ago the quality changed significantly. Although the packaging is the same, the red case in the color packs were replaced with a pink one and the quality for all is TERRIBLE. The cases screech when opened in some cases and they don't hold the CDs well at all. The website listed on the packaging is also UNAVAILABLE.Cheap Chinese junk product now. I recommend NOT buying these unless they go back to previous quality."
5,Great book for me and my wife,"Well, no matter what others who don't understand this subject seem to say.......my wife and I appreciate this book...it was well written and easy to understand. We love the fun techniques and have tried out many of them. We would recommend it to anyone who wants to please and be pleased. Great book!"
3,It's only okay.,"I bought this in anticipation of revamping a few techniques. Turns out what's offered in this book is stuff I figured out when I was a teenager. This is good for virgins, but grown women can be better served with another book."
5,"Fun, Fun, Fun",This book takes a light hearted view to making one of lifes joys even more fun. Pleasuring your man cannot be explained any better.
2,Didn't help me much....,This book wasn't much help and I ended up getting another practice book that was much better from the local book store. I had bought more of this 'brand' of books at the same time and none of them were really that helpful. I think it was the layout of the books that got to me.
4,fast merengue,I purchased this item for one particular song that I was going to use in a fitness class. The rest of the music is good with fast merengues. The only thing I don't like is the interludes between songs and that oro solido starts all their songs with an intro that gets annoying after hearing it in one or two songs. Overall good product and the delivery from third party via amazon was fast.
5,Tied Up In Knots,"As a director of a preschool/kindergarten I am always searching for good literature. I have found a winner with Carl Sommer's ""Fun Times With Timeless Values Collection"". The concept of sharing is presented in one of these books, ""Tied Up In Knots"". Children (and adults),I believe, will thoroughly enjoy their visit to the farm and learn how life can be so much easier and pleasant when we SHARE. Our characters do discover sharing really does bring happiness! Every classroom and home can smile once this principle is practiced."
4,An Oldie but Goodie,"The content is from 1995 but the book was inexpensive, and I like the examples and that it is spiral bound. The glossary for Excercise 39 is outrageous!"
3,decent wheel for training,"These are all around the most average wheel on the market. They are light, but not too light. They are durable, but not indestructible. They are terrible in wind tunnel tests but feel good climbing. They are cheaper than carbon but more expensive than what an average aluminum wheel should be. The coolest thing about them is the wide spokes that make them look awesome, unfortunately they also act like windmills when riding and create ridiculous amounts of drag and pull in crosswinds. That said, if you are looking for a great training wheel that can double as a durable race wheel these are a good option. Or you could spend 100 - 200 dollars less and buy some American classic 420 wheels. They are about the same weight, more aerodynamic, just as - if not more sturdy, and you have a much better feeling wheel."
3,cute but hard to keep tight,These shoes are really cute and well made. My daughter has no trouble wearing them at all however it's hard to get them tight enough. My daughter has really wide feet so I bought the wide size and they are wider then a normal wide shoe.
1,Terrible shoes!!,"These pair of shoes caused serious swollen ankles after my daughter's first day with them. I found out their tongues have stiff edges especially around the labeling area, and the area around the ankle is also too stiff. It is a nightmare experience. When I was trying to put the shoes back on her feet, she just cannot walk. It is so painful that she would not let us touch her ankles. It made me want to sue Stride Rite for hurting my daughter."
2,Overshadowed by political bias...,"The first half of the book was great, very informative and written fairly and accurately. But as soon as the subject turned to modern day political issues, the overwhelming prejudice of the blatantly liberal authors began to shine through. It would have been such a great book if it could have presented non-partisan views on the politics of oil, but instead the authors couldn't resist pushing their anti-Bush agenda for the entire second half of the book.Their arguments were totally one-sided and they conveniently omitted many important facts and arguments about the reasons for the current administrations' energy policies. I was very disappointed in that aspect of the book; and although the rest of the material was well presented, it was hard to not question the motives behind each explanation and wonder what else they weren't telling me."
3,Not bad Not good,"Not a great movie, but a young Amanda Righetti is always good.The acting is passable, but the plot suffers.But again, Amanda Righetti is in the movie."
5,David Heavener and Amanda Righetti=Great Chemistry,"David Heavener stars, writes, directs and produces this great movie of fascinating nudity, crime and suspense. Heavener is great in his role and Amanda Righetti is sexy and I mean SEXY! She is in the greatest of nude through the whole pacing of the movie. Damn she is fine! I give this movie a 5 out of 5 rating."
2,so so movie,This is nothing like the old anime series. The acting was so so at best. the story line was bad.
2,Tried hard to like it,"but this book is a disapointment. This reader had hoped the premise of a less than perfect heroine, and a hero who finds her beauty in non-traditional ways would be fresh and a satisfying read. Instead, Melissa, the heroine, comes off as niave and standoff-ish instead of sympathetic with strength mixed in. She goes very quickly from hating anyone from the ""outside"" world to hopping into bed with the hero and hoping that one time will get her pregnant. Which is a disturbing thought, with the heroine already having borderline mental illness or social phobia at best. The Hero is the strongest point of this book, not breaking his word to a friend to protect the heroine and putting up with her behavior far beyond what most men would endure."
1,Don't waste your money!,"Don't waste your money!There are more tips and better directions in basic quilling books ... This was a total waste of money.The entire book does not even mention roses. I could see the purist approach eschewing punches, but surely folded and spiral roses belong here.For fringing, it just directs the reader to fringe. Huh? No mention of the best type of scissors for this, the ease of bulldog clips, or commercial fringers.Those are the things beginners need to know!It shows shapes, but most of the directions are in the individual projects. Beginners would find it much more helpful to see all basic shapes and how to make them.Five pages are wasted on a ""Children's Gallery"", comprised of colored photos of shapes made by kids. One page would have been more than enough!"
3,It's ok,"I was a little disappointed when I received this to find it was all plastic, like a kids toy that is plastic but painted to look like metal. It works well though."
3,Looks good & cheep.,"works good, looks ok but cheep & it was cheep. Buy it if you like cheep! If cheep is ok it works good."
3,An excellent sports for for any age.,"Against all odds is the story of Jim Abbot, the one handed pitcher who took baseball by storm at the close of the 1980s. This is an excellent book for children that love baseball or want to read something inspiring from real life. This book is very informative, giving information that will make other sports books easier to understand. Kids will keep coming back to Against All Odds, and parents will enjoy reading it to them."
5,Instructor loves this book,"I'm a Java instructor, and I love this book. It's excellent for cross-training folks from the mainframe to the Web. The book is divided into modules that can be taught in instructor-led classes in the same order. Depending on your students, you could cover all modules in 8 days. Each section has ""one-minute"" drills that students can orally respond to (although the answers are in small print on the same page). Also, each module has sample programs that literally give students an order to follow as in: ""Step-by-Step: 1. Create a new file called ..."" My only disappointment is that the author didn't cover Java topics that are intermediate to advanced in nature because he does such an effective job. His module on Java Threading is so clear and consise that students can easily follow the concepts."
5,Amazing book... Huge Help for Non-Programmers,"I haven't completed the entire book but so far so good. The book is a great help for Non-programmers that are trying to get up to speed in Java. The explanations, examples and exercises are awesome.The way the book is structured is also outstanding. If you are the type of person trying to understand what Java is about and being able to code without struggling with too much technical jargon, this book is for you.I highly recommend this book for anyone interested in learning Java from scratch.In addition the list of frustrating Java books presented by one of the reviewers I would add Thinking in Java, it might be a great book for Intermediate or Advanced user but for beginners ""No way Jose"" too complex and very hard to follow.I have completed this book now and I think the 5 stars that I original assigned to the book are well preserved, this book is a great jump-start for Java newbies. Excellent book in a nutshell.My 2 cents"
5,Great for newcomers,"In our company, we have some junior programmers that I get to supervise. For them, this is essentially their first programming job. I was searching for a good introductory java book to help get them up to speed. After some travails, I narrowed it down to this book.It explains enough about java to get new programmers off to a good start. Several of my guys said this book was highly ""cool""! Glad they liked it."
5,"Fine performances, spectacular sound","If you are looking for that pure polka sound, you won't find it here. This CD blends three styles: polkas, marches, and ""Hooked on Classics"". That's a good combination for those of us who like a strong beat combined with a good melody. The tempo resembles that of Polish polkas, a bit slower than German or American. Recording quality is spectacular, even on a small boombox. Though apparently recorded in 1971, there is none of that ""re-released"" sound. You'd better enjoy the instruments, because there are no vocals on any of these. The first track, Trompeten-Muckl, is better known as the Clarinet Polka. All 18 tracks are thoroughly enjoyable."
2,Could be better,"I would trade this book in for one done on the same topic by somebody else. Zaloga is generally tops in the field, but other books in this series give you more for the money. For example, US Army Infantry Divisions of the same series gives you far more detail. Mr. Zaloga should take a look at that book before doing more - a new and higher standard exist."
2,"Nice try, but no thanks.","To be succinct, this is not very good. Think of a watery dressing with little in the way of ranch flavor, more like a hint of ranch. Yes, watery dressing with a hint of ranch.Its not good. Be cautious."
4,I eat more veggies with this dip!,"This is a handy product to have around if you're watching calories/carbs/fat. I know I need to eat more vegetables, but usually don't. Having this makes it fun and not drudgery. Peppers, broccoli, anything tastes good in this dip. I've given it as gifts to people wanting to modify their diet due to special events or changes in their health. Recommended."
5,Excellent Read!!,"This book is an excellent read for anyone with a Chronic Illness. I like the way it references different illness's and the way that the author takes an entire chapter to talk about how having a chronic illness affects our lives to the highest degree and that we have to go through a period of mourning our old lives and self because we are different now, however, there is no reason we cannot go on to live successfully. I read this book in one day. Awesome!Lynne"
3,"good material, but too much repeating","The book promotes the idea that people are controlled by lizard aliens and the sinister grays that are their minions. Is it true or not, I leave that open. By the way, this opinion is backed by the channeled material and therefore should not be taken as ultimate truth.What bothered me most was excessive repeating of the material, for example the predator story from Castaneda's book was repeated many times over and over again. Also, the talk often winds up too long and tedious, whereas the point could be expressed in a much shorter way. The book could be half of it's size, really.But if you are hesitating, then I still would recommend you to get this book, especially when you are the ""positive aliens"" person, because it does not hurt to become aware of some opposite ideas as well."
1,High Strangeness Hyperdimensions and the Process of Alien Abduction,"This book ranks as the worst I've ever tried to read. I couldn't bypass the author's exagerrated opinion of herself, reminding me of Hitler's self image, to look for her message. She spends a great deal of time deriding other authors as she tries to superimpose her hypotheses on her readers. I hate I added to her financial gain giving her fuel to talk about her excess weight, poor health and direct line to some unseen force."
1,This is the miniature edition,There are multiple editions of this book all with the same title.You can get the 400pp double size edition for the same money.It is a much better buy!!!
5,Thought-provoking in the extreme!,"Astonishing is one word for it. If you've ever wondered about densities, dimensions, quantum physics, critical channelling, aliens (or hyperdimensional Beings) government agency skullduggery and their relationship to the world in which we live, then this is the book for you.You'll never view reality in the same light. It certainly changed my outlook and filled in the missing pieces of the puzzle. I'm still reeling from it all.What a rollercoaster ride!"
5,Refreshing Critical Thinking About the Paranormal,"High Strangeness is a very interesting and refreshing book that leads one to expand their thinking and increase their objectivity when considering unexplained events that occur in this world. I have read many UFO and paranormal books that almost treated the reader as if they were dim-witted and should just believe some contrived viewpoint. However, through this book the author exposes the reader to new ideas or uncomfortable perspectives in a manner that respectfully stimulates thinking and encourage critical analysis. Highly recommended."
5,sturdy- and good looking.,sturdy- exactly what was needed.Easy to install.looks great.perfect fit for the location.non-slip texture is appropriate and nice
4,Pretty good if you don't have any other 5 star books to read,"Scott has been writing a series of well-told, entertaining books centering on hidden treasure protected by the Scottish descendants of the Knights Templar. This one is no exception. However, these characters can be frustrating. Sorcha, her heroine, is one of those young women you may or may not like. She's spunky and daring, but can also be seen to be immature. Hugo, her hero, is also slightly frustrating because he is a bit of a male chauvinist, and therefore, high-handed in his treatment of Sorcha. Needless to say, they fight constantly. Scott included these characters in previous books, so she was bound by character traits and personalities she had already given them. These two weren't my favorite. But, this series of books is pretty riveting. Adela, the next sister in line to be given a story, will be more interesting and likeable, I'm certain."
4,Awesome!!!,"I bought this for my 13 year old daughter for Christmas and actually I'm not sure if I bought it for myself! But she loves it, too. We like playing the contest the system has built into it. The only minor thing I wish was improved is the music background - it would sound so much better with real guitars, etc. But this system is so portable compared to having a big box machine. My daughter can put it in her purse or overnight bag and take it to friends' houses. We bought the contemporary country music chip and it makes it a lot more fun for the younger crowd, since they don't know many of the songs that the system comes with. We love love love it!"
1,Bad memory chip or bad mic?,"I purchased the Leadsinger 3700 along with the 80's pop rock and the Teens 2003 musikartridge's. It all worked nicely until trying to access the songs on the Teens 2003 chip. The titles of all the songs would show on the screen but when pressing play, the unit would either turn off or it just wouldn't work. I tried relocating the chip into the other memory slots and the same problem occured. Since I had no problems with the other music chip or the built in songs, I concluded that the Teens 2003 chip was just a bad one. After exchanging the chip for another one, I had the exact same problems. This time I'm returning everything. It's not worth the hassle."
4,Fun- just don't expect great quality sound,"This is a great fun product that can really add to an evening or party. If you are looking to hear the same music and arrangements used in the originals songs, unfortunately you will be still singing to a much poorer midi version. (Everything sounds kind of soft and synthy. But if you are not particular and just want to sing and have a good time. This is a great affordable portable way to Karaoke your heart away."
3,WoooW not worth the money,"This product is not worth the money, unless you are about 10 years old and don't know better."
2,Has the depth of a bad pop song.,"Our professor had us buy this - err - tome about Religion. Save your money and buy something else. Very poorly put together. A few sentences here and there regarding Freud, Jung, and James."
4,"Extremely interesting, if highly personal and idiosyncratic","This book is less systematic than I had hoped, but I found it very interesting nonetheless. I believe that anyone who enjoys logically tight argumentation and taut writing in philosophy will enjoy this work, as they will almost anything by the brilliant Bencivenga. Recommended."
4,Stereo Pionner,"The stereo is on perfect conditions and arrive in the time especified, didn't have any problem, Thanks by the service."
4,Only one problem,"I love the color, a rich beautiful blue, and it's waterproof. However, I am using it in a Parallel pen for drawing, and I have filled the barrel of the pen with the ink. In order to fill the barrel of the pen, I have to put a slight coating of silicone sealer around the threads of the pen barrel, so the ink doesn't leak out. This works with most inks, but with this ink, it manages to leak out of the barrel through the threads. Since my sister has also had the same problem, we think there is something in the ink that eats through the silicone sealer. Other inks we have used in these pens do not eat through the sealer. If you are using this ink in a different pen, or you fill a cartridge with it, you might be happier, because the color is wonderful."
2,Uninspiring!,"The book is selective in its contents with many glaring omissions and simply appears to be a piece of propaganda for American science. It reads like a Hollywood film script, except this time America doesn't save the world, they invent it! This is probably a reflection of the number of US government sponsors involved with the study. The introduction even mentions threats to US national security, economic strength and"
2,Ok,kinda boring and hard to follow. small printing did not help either. would not recommend this book. was just required reading
3,wrong item,Not what I expected. Start up kit I recieved was for a different model compressor. This was not useful tom. I returned it.
1,Northern Tool No More!,"This start-up kit was supposedly shipped with the compressor ordered at the same time. The start-up kit was never received. I used the Amazon site ""Contact Seller"" messaging 5 times over a two week period trying to get someone at Northern Tool to simply acknowledge my problem, but to no avail! Amazon wouldn't help with the problem until the delivery window quoted by Northern Tool had passed (although it was clear the item had been lost, as all records showed it to have been shipped concurrent with the compressor).Finally, a month after delivery of the compressor (sans start-up kit) my claim with Amazon resulted in a credit for the kit. Not my typical experience with Amazon or their sellers. So if Northern Tool is fulfilling your order, I hope it goes smoothly. If it doesn't you're likely hanging out to dry for a month until Amazon steps in."
1,Don't Do It,"For $35 you can make 12 of these yourself from Lowe's. Kicking tee is super cheap, the ball even worse."
3,"Great Idea, flimsy construction","Bought this for Christmas for two grandsons aged 7 and 4. Wasn't sturdy enough to stay put together. I see it in their garage in pieces, haven't seen them use it since that Christmas day."
2,Not very sturdy,"My son played with it for a little while, but when put together, it's quite flimsey. When stored, it usually falls apart so he has to put it together every time he wants to play football. Sometimes not worth it to him, so it spends more time in the garage in my way than anything."
5,New Fan,"On a visit to St. Louis last month, friends ""dragged"" me to The Jazz Bistro for a ""night out"" that I didn't even want. BLESS THEM !! What an incredible surprise !! It was Cassandre McKinley's CD release show, and I am so glad I was there. Ms. McKinley's renditions of Marvin Gaye's music were just awesome. Her voice is smooth and rich. I bought the CD and haven't stopped playing it since. It is so obvious that Ms. McKinley is truly FEELING every note she sings. It really touches me. If you want insight and emotion delivered with a truly beautiful voice, you will find it on this CD. I am a now a true (if new) fan."
3,"Try it, you'll like it.",Heard her on Pandora radio as I was searching for Brandi Carlile's work. Found her equally enjoyable.
3,I bought this CD for the song that was featured on One Tree Hill,"I can't decide if I like this CD or not. I heard the first song on One Tree Hill and decided I would give it a try. I do really like ""Where I Stood."" It's a very pretty song and I like to sing it to myself, but the words make me sad when I think about them. ""100 Round the Bends"" gets on my nerves. Maybe that's why I can't decide if I like the entire CD or not. I'm not crazy about ""Angela,"" ""Peachy,"" or ""Forgive Me."" I do enjoy ""Steer"" and ""Going North."" This CD was in my changer for a few weeks and I took it out about a week ago. I haven't really missed it since I took it out (even though I still sing ""Where I Stood"" to myself)."
3,Missy Higgins :: On a Clear Night,"A gift. Her music and lyrics seem interesting. My grandson says this is really good and loves the lyrics.Sorry girls, he's taken."
3,More variety please...,"I like the sound of the CD overall, but I wish there had been more variety to it. There are a couple of upbeat songs, but I think that too many of the tracks sound the same. The songs definitely show forth the unique quality to her voice.In short, if you're looking for a calming, rainy-day CD this is the one for you. If you're looking for more upbeat songs in the mix just buy MP3 of the songs you like from the samples."
4,Wonderful songs,"What can one say about Missy other than that she is fabulous? Having had the pleasure of seeing her perform in a small restaurant with only a piano and a 100 spectators, I can say that the songs do not require anything other than her voice. The production on this album doubtless adds to the songs, although it is slightly different to her first album. But not to worry, there are still several numbers which feature the piano quite strongly.I personally love the fact that she sings with her true accent, as opposed to faking an American accent as so many pop singers do. It adds to the truth in the music. There is no pretense. What you see is what you get.Favourite tracks: Where I stood, Steer, Sugarcane"
4,well-rounded disc,"If I were a few decades younger I would have just downloaded Where I Stand from iTunes. Instead, I took a gamble and bought the whole CD. I was pleased to hear that all of the tracks are as interesting as the single. Okay to leave in the CD player for the whole hour commute. Sort of Indigo Girls meet Alanis with a fresher feel."
5,Talent,"Talented songwriter and artist. Great new sound from ""down under"".Must buy CD if you like new talent!"
5,Missy Higgins - A must listen,"*Her new CD was recorded in Los Angeles with famed producer Mitchell Froom, who has worked with such legendary artists as Elvis Costello, Paul McCartney, Bonnie Raitt, Sheryl Crow and Crowded House.*Neil Finn of Crowded House plays guitar on ""Peachy"" and provided backup vocals on ""Going North.""You will not stop playing this! She is the freshest sound out of Australia today. 5 Stars!!!!!!"
5,Great strap great price.,"Although this is not the best length to buy a recovery strap in, it is a steal at this price and for most people that dont do extreme off roading it will be more than they will ever need. I personally bought it for the beach and the many people who dont know how to drive in the sand."
4,Have Not Used!!,"Item looks to be made very well, like length, width and strength. Purchased to be carried in my truck to use as needed, have not used so I have NO idea how it will work."
4,Make me want to cry,These fit perfectly. And they are almost perfect. I hate that most jeans today have a low rise and/or are boot thus making them not cover your backside and too long for normal shoes or wearing around the house barefoot. I would 100% love these jeans because they fit exactly like I want them too. But I want black jeans and the fabric chosen for the black jeans picks up every bit of pet hair there is and doesn't let go even when you wash them. I could cry.
5,Gloria Vanderbilt jeans,"Item arrived as expected, new item, and arrived well withint the window. I expect the item to arrive within a week or less, even though the window is longer."
2,"Woah, I'm swimming in them.","Usually these pants size well, but for some reason this are huge. I need a belt to hold them up. Tried cooking them to death in hot water wash, but still huge."
3,Tapered Leg - Ugh,"These were very disappointing. They are good quality both in fabric & workmanship, BUT the cut is very unflattering for larger women. Tapered legs went out of style years ago b/c they don't make us look good. And that's how these are cut. When the leg gets more narrow at the bottom, it makes a woman's middle look heavier by comparison. I bought a pair of these on sale and sent 'em back."
3,Do not fit as well as old Amandas,"Nice quality construction and fabric. My old Amandas fit perfectly, and these have a large gap in the back of the waist. Will be fine for winter with a belt and a sweater or fleece over it."
4,Patience pays off for the history buff,"This work takes a little patience to fully enjoy. Lyons covers a wide range of what he calls 'Impossible Journeys"" to include: remarkable, but generally historical events; legendary events that may have a basis in historical events; myths and legends; and outright made-up voyages and voyagers. There is no apparent order in this collection of essays, and I found that the first one or two were not very engaging, but I enjoyed the collection quite a lot after I got into a bit more.This work contains a lot that explains how places got their names, how and why maps evolved during the age of exploration, and why some adventurers are household names now while others are virtually unheard of. Well worth the read for any history buff, but not really light reading."
1,Just 2003 Edition with a different Dust Cover,"I purchased this book with great expectations of having an update to my 2003 edition. When the book came the copyright was 2003, not 2011 and there was absolutely no new information from the 2003 edition. I was greatly disappointed and returned the book within a day. My advice, look for a 2003 edition and buy that for a retail of $30 instead of nearly $50 for this one."
4,Great indoor family fun!,"I bought this originally thinking that we would play with it in the garden, but it has turned into our favorite family room game. Even my three year old can get in on the fun, especially when we are a little generous with the rules! I highly recommend this for families."
4,Best beginners' guide,"I have quite a few `bug' guides and the Peterson guides are always my favorite. The drawings are excellent, the writing is clear, and I like the behavioral and collecting notes added. There are more flashy guides with more pictures but they tend to be more limited - you can only put so many pictures in a book. They also usually cost much more. This is the book I would buy for someone wanting to learn more about the entire insect world and begin identifying the bugs they find. If their interest grows I would simply move up the full version of the same book."
1,Impossible to find your bug!,"First, this is a teeny book. One that you'd stuff in your shirt pocket. Two, most of the pictures are drawings. Not impressed. Third, it's impossible to actually FIND the bug you're holding in your hand! The only good thing is learning about insects. Identifying crawly things in your yard is for another book."
4,Peterson First Guide to Insects of North America,All the Peterson Guides are well known as field guides and always useful.
3,Not what I ordered,"I thought I had ordered the original guide for the same price but was sent this book. Unfortunetly I had thrown out the invoice and did not realize until a few days later that it was a kids book. So I reordered the book I really needed for my class, as a reference book."
5,Costume Haute Couture...,"I picked this book up at a local bookstore for a whopping $5.00 . I enjoyed the movies, but they definitely aren't at the top of my favorites list. This book appealed to me purely for the fashion, costume, and design aspects. And it delivers a beautiful display for all those things. I actually found myself reading the book (usually I just dissect the pictures and draw inspiration that way), and found it to be well written as well. The text, gives insight into how a large scale costuming production works for theatrical purposes. It illustrates all of the dynamics of organizing such a production from start to finish. I imagine this would be a good read for someone interested in the theatrical costuming field. Besides that, it is a wonderful coffee table book , or uber bible of clothes for the ""Con"" participant. Surely worth ten times what I paid!"
3,"Dressing Ep I, II and III!","The book is a must have ofcourse, but I did expect a LOT more.Star Wars is still driven by the original trilogy, and so I expected to read and see in depth pictures of the original costumes worn by Luke, Han, Leia, and the original Stormtrooper gear, and such, bud sadly there is nothing in here only a tiny photo as a reminder of what was... The book is full of Amidala costumes which are quite remarkable, but maybe a seperate book just of her would have been better.Thus its a dissapointment on one side, but still a treasure chest (a quarter full only) on the other! My advice is to still get it as its better than nothing!..:)"
3,Not one of the best,"This soldier has a silly looking face. The one plus is that he has a lot of equipment, though some it has that awful sticky material that hangs on the belts. I basically bought this to improve my equipment collection and get another body the put in my specialist uniforms. I try not to laugh when I look at this poor guy's facial features.To sum it up, you get a lot of bang for the buck in terms of equipment, but I highly recommend almost any other 21ST Century soldier for complete satisfaction. Only get this once you have experienced the company's other great toys, otherwise you may be disappointed."
1,"Ultimate Ripoff, This toy falls apart","Ultimate soldier should be called ultimate rip off. Every time I by one for my kid the toy's accesories just disinegrate. No durability. I've decided to purchase zero more of this company for my children. Hasbro's GI Joe might be a little less detailed, but the value of the toy is 100% quality."
4,The Menu Decoder,"This is meant to be a companion book so it is sized to fit in a shirt or inside jacket pocket. The slim volume is divided into chapters by geographic areas and each chapter has information on the culinary history of the area and advice for ordering in restaurants.My copy was published in 1980 and purchased in 1983. I take it with me when travelling to cities with a wide choice of ethnic restaurants. With over 10,000 terms defined in it's pages, I can always find something interesting to try - and avoid items that could trigger alergic reactions!Cons: There is no pronounciation guide and the type is rather small.If you enjoy ethnic food, this thin volume will give you the information needed to choose widely in your food adventures."
4,Cute Read,Adventures of the Teen Furies - is a YA book about a group of teenagers that come together and bond over the playing of a game. From mental issues to teenage coupling this is a cute read.MelissaReviewer for 1000 + Books to Read
4,Great juvenile fiction!,"I am just taking polite exception to the lower ratings. Everyone has an opinion or two, I suppose! I have read every book this author has written; and while I agree that this early effort is not her best work, I must say I found the characterizations VERY believable. It's easy for a reader to ""see themselves"" in the book. It's not always pretty, but such is the life of a juvenile! Solid work."
2,Reality unfulfilled,"I was deeply moved by this book, too bad it was with anger and sadness. While the characterization was effective, the story lacked."
2,A Waste of My Money,"This book didn't measure up to my expectations, I thought it would have nicer designs and more variety. I haven't looked through it again since the day I bought it. I packed it away along with the other design book I bought from this company."
5,"If you read only one book on writing, make it this one!","Oftentimes I've admired writers whose succint style and laser-beam like precision gave their writings an impressive and expressive edge. I only wish some wise soul had exposed me to a book such as this 30 years earlier. Please plant the intellectual seeds of sequoias in any young writers you know, and buy a copy of this book as a gift. Professor Williams extraordinary lessons in style, cohesion and use of the English language make this book an absolute joy to read"
5,Stunningly achieves its purpose,"Although I was never a bad writer, the basis of clear, concise writing had always eluded me. Thanks to this book, I was able to learn the mechanics behind good writing im my last year of high school.Dr. William's book was used in my Advanced Placement Literature class. The little tome showed us that clear writing was not an abstract, metaphysical talent that was divinely bestowed upon only the lucky few. It was, in some ways, an equalizer...I would recommend this book without reservation. I only wish someone had introduced it to me at the beginning of high school."
1,Stiff fingers,"I've been taking fish oil supplements for many years and typically buy them when they go on sale. I bought Nature Made 1200 mg fish oil softgels about 2 months ago and now I'm getting very stiff fingers each morning. I went on-line and found others complaining about the same problem, and one person specifically stated Nature Made brand. I'm going to stop taking them for a few days and see if my condition improves. And, if so, I'll try another brand to see if the same problem arises."
2,Actually has 360 mg,"The true dose is only revealed by adding the EPA and the DHA. One softgel has 216 mg of EPA and 144 mg of DHA. So, one softgel has 360 mg of helpful fish oil and the remaining 840 mg is filler fish oil.When comparing fish oil, look at the back panel supplement facts. Add the EPA and DHA to get the true MG and make sure you look at the serving size. Nature made has 2 softgels per serving size, so you must divide by 2 to get the per softgel info.Twin Labs Mega appears to have the most."
5,"I loved the Play ""Driving Miss Daisy""","I loved the movie with Jessica Tandy, Morgan Freeman, and Dan Ackroyd. And I love the play ! Does anyone recall a TV show a few years ago called, I think, ""Amazing Grace"" ? It starred a Jewish teenage girl who lived with her parents and Grandmother who had survived the Holocaust. She had a rich friend who had an elderly black chauffeur. The Jewish Grandma and the chauffeur discovered they had more in common than they thought. Both were from backgrounds where they were persecuted just because of who they are. This story and that show remind me of each other."
4,Driving Miss Daisy,It was good very much like the movie! It varies a little from the movie versionbut still good. the only thing I didn't care for was the curtain situation and the lights!
2,Too short and simple for its own good.,"""Driving Miss Daisy"" is the epitome of simple-ness and shortness. While some plays thrive on their simplicity, I felt it spoiled this play. With no scenes or acts, this play relies on fade-outs and a heavy imagination. We see a 20-year span involving homes, cars, and people aging all on one stage. Because we only get a taste of the people through this 20-year span, I could not warm up to and get to know the three characters in this play. By the end, I know that Miss Daisy and Hoke are close, but I only know this because they've known each other for 20-years; I did not see the closeness emerge for myself. I had truly hoped for more concerning Miss Daisy teaching Hoke to read and write - this would have added great character interaction. The screenwriter's had to work hard to make this 39-page play into a 99-minute movie involving scenes and actual time spans. I hope the movie is better. I do not recommend."
2,Did not work properly!,"The first and second time I tried to install the visors, they seemed to fit as they should,but the windows would not go past the bottom of the visor, making them usless to me..."
2,rear visors did not fit,"the visors for the rear windows did not fit..could not get windows to close..the ones for the front windows fit perfectly so i know i got the right set.cant return the set as i had put the front window visors in and had removed the tape and set them in place, and it would cost more money to ship them back from alaska then they are worth..i hope this stops someone else from buying a cheaply made product that doesnt fit all the windows it advertises as doing..."
5,Watch out for the black cat ahead!,"I was surprised by how much I enjoyed this collection of poems. Pickard successfully weaves themes and images throughout the collection; moreover, the themes and images do not seemed forced into any of the poems to keep the thread going. There are so many wonderful poems in the book that it would be difficult to pick just one great poem. Each poem has something unique to offer the reader. If you're at all interested in the impact of family history, superstition, nature, the meaning of life, or dying, then this book will not be a disappointment!"
4,excellent music and recording; flawed manual search,"These songs are the ""correct"" versions we heard on the radio in 1966, not trial versions that sounded different as so many nostalgia CDs use. The recordings are high quality and sound great. If you let the CD play on its own, all is OK. From about #8 on, if you try to advance to the next song manually, you get an error and the CD stops. Amazon cheerfully replaced my first CD but the second one had the same problem. I kept it because of the great music."
4,Learn from the past...,"This is a very informative book and is on my school's ""Suggested Reading"" to help fortify what we're being taught. I was surprised at its size; pocket novel, but there are lots of example photos and the info is terrific!"
3,Reliable but slow and limited power,"I bought this dimmer to control my Christmas lights. After setting it up for the second year, I found that these switches were not as useful as theSmarthome Insteon Lamplinc V2 3-PIN, which I wish I had bought instead. There are some speed issues between the switches and the controller. It takes one or two seconds for the light to change after sending the command, even when they are on the same circuit."
3,"James Last, Non Stop Dancing","I was looking for instrumental music and I was disappointed with this CD because it sounds like a live recording with a lot of extra noises.The chorus sings every song without planning, it may be the audience itself singing. I thought instrumental music was instruments only but apparently I was mistaken. I don't like live recordings."
5,This is a well written and comprehensive study of ferns.,"This book has excellent photographs and drawings, and describes in great detail the may species of ferns. The beginning of the book is technical, and defines the structural differences between fern types, how to recoginize the parts of a fern, etc. Anyone interested in growing wild or nursery-grown ferns should have this book in their collection. It will allow you to identify the ferns you have, or see in the forests."
1,"No, no, no, no",Not worth your money. It has a very limited set of lesson. I doubt if this will improve your kid's vocabulary.I'ts far better to buy flash cards.
3,"Good, functional product","Good product, only issue would be the slow download 2.4 times rather then 4 times. If you can go away from the room to do your own thing, then buy this. Otherwise the same product with a faster download would be a better choice."
2,Barely a good t.v. movie,"I love the ""end of the world"" movies. Too bad this fell short. The worst part was the 2 channel audio w/ the worst audio mixing.The plot was average. Good thing I only paid $4- for it.Kim Delaney was good in her role but a bit over weight and it showed."
5,We LOVE Peep,The Peep series is one of our all time favorite shows!!Only wish you could find show related items at retail stores.Highly recommend for all kids big and small!
2,Not what I expected,"This book was fun to read for the first 30 or so pages. After that, it seemed as if the author was defending her right to socialize with the upper classes.While there were a few useful pointers, I think this is a book to borrow from the library rather than purchase. It's entertaining in some ways, but not a book I'd keep.For a tour of the class structure and what differentiates the upper classes, I far preferredU and Non-U Revisited, although some of it is very dated. Nevertheless, class is a fairly eternal concept. Trends come and go, but the essence of good taste remains the same."
5,tHE BEST review,i didn't buy this book. i got it at the libray. i have read every book in the series!
2,"Gorgeous box, however doesn't work","I cannot say enough about how nice the Steinhausen looks. It was also packed extremely well. Unfortunately, despite trying every mode of operation that each winder has, the winder failed to keep any of my eight watches wound. Within three days every watch had stopped. When I contacted the customer service number for Steinhausen (which takes you to GadgetUninverse), they were less than helpful.This is another case of you get what you pay for. Stick with other brands if you want your watches to stay wound. However, if you just want a nice jewelry box, you might consider this piece."
4,Great Pictures and Paintings!,"Half of this book is about famous paleontologists, what dinosaurs are, and how they became extinct. The next half has at least 80 pictures and paintings of different species of dinosaurs, and a description of their characteristics and how they live. I would especially recommend it to 11 and 12 year olds who know their dinosaurs. WARNING: This is not a little kid's book. It does contain A LOT of information. It has at least a page on each species of dinosaur, but I think it should go into even more detail on these amazing animals."
5,Very Interesting,"Loved the book,,hard to put down. Highly recommed for pilots. Like all the detail in the storys of the people that the author had met along the way. Good book for people interested in bush living and for the history of the North."
1,This Is No Travelogue,"After reading the Editorial Reviews here, I bought this book hoping for a travelogue from a ""dentist turned bush pilot."" Instead, this is a book of poorly done undergraduate-level philosophy.The author treats respectfully both the Inuit, who apologized to the spirits of the animals they killed, and mid-twentieth-century intellectuals, who were absolutely certain (unencumbered by data) that there must be intelligent life in outer space. For Christianity and western civilization in general he shows nothing but contempt. Whatever.This book's title and promotion promise something entirely different from this book. I wanted to read about the flying: How he read the weather, how he assessed whether a particular lake was adequate for landing. Is it possible to land in a lake that's too short to take off from? What other flying has this author done? Why did he take this trip? Why was he alone?Well, I did find the answer to that last question: He's a sophist and a bore."
3,True North: Exploring the Great Wilderness by Bush Plane,"Many interesting tidbits of information on Canadian bush history with several spectacular photos. One needs to be cautioned that the author will frequently deviate to hop on his soapbox to decry Christianity and reject Creation while espousing evolution as fact. The book does, however, inspire you to yearn for a trip of your own into the Canadian and Alaskan bush. While the author feels the ""algae colonies brought us the breath of life,"" he should have used a different forum. I didn't feel this was a guide book for discovery as I had hoped."
5,Redefining travelogue,"True North redefines travelogue, taking the reader to places and times most of us will never go. It's a new ""window"" to our world, with lots of polemics on the history of Canada, and the rest of the world that shaped it. A rare mix of adventure, history and philosophy. Never preachy."
1,"Hard to follow, rambling","I've read a lot of Alaska bush pilot memoirs and this was my least favorite. I'm a float pilot myself and I had trouble following his progress. And there are lots of ramblings about the environment, etc. My favorite is still Don Sheldon's Wager with the Wind."
1,Deceptive and Overbearing,"Have you ever been surprised when visiting a friend's house they pull out the slide show and force you along as they relive their holiday? Brutal, isn't it?As a pilot, I was looking forward to a bush plane book. However, I was duped by True North. As good a writer as Erickson is, he could not make me care about his vacation trip. Like an overbearing professor, he tosses in disjointed lectures which are meant to impress me as much as educate me. Rarely the subject matter related to his trip. Often they were horribly ill-fitted lessons of Galileo or Vasco. Who cares?Furthermore, I was led to dislike Erickson. As a pilot, it seems, he is marginal. However, this tree hugging, earth worshipping, religion hater is a gifted writer. The book, however, is NOT a bush plane book.If you are curious about his bias and his vacation, you might like True North. If you are looking for a plane or flying book, spare yourself the inevitable misery."
2,The books are good.,"The books are great, but I have had to order and return the entire items twice because the audio CD's would not work. The CD's skipped and made weird sounds when they would play. I give the items two stars for that reason."
5,Extremely pleased,"I wanted a notebook with a large screen that still had Windows XP, instead of Windows Vista. This suits me to a tee."
5,Excellent cd in excellent shape,i heard some of this cd one night on a jazz program. i was quite surprised to hear that Don Was produced and played on it; didn't know he was a jazz player. It's quite a good album!
5,One of the best shows on TV,I love this show. It is so realistic you almost can believe they are a real family. Lots of good lessons learned.
5,Amazing show.,I have been watching this show for about a month and a half and I absolutely love it. The writing and acting is spectacular.
5,Great show,This is one of my favorite shows and I love being able to watch it on the Amazon instant video!
5,I love this show!,"Another season with the Braverman's! Just as good as seasons past. Can't wait for season four!! Three DVDs of adopting angst, relationship issues, familial dramas. AWESOME."
2,Looks and feels like a copy,"We were so excited to get the third season as we are big fans of the show! The price was really good when we ordered and now I know why. I compared the packaging of the third season to that of season 1&2 that we had previously ordered and everything about it seems like it is a copy. The packaging is faded, the images are fuzzy. he discs themselves also have subpar graphics. Also, the DVD inside has amateur menus and it even promotes a URL. Very disappointed that this was fulfilled by Amazon. The show quality is also sub par. It is not HD quality at all. We got had, don't do the same avoid this product. cheers."
2,Extremely disappointed!,"I love this show and I was so excited to get it in the mail; however, when I started watching the episodes, three out of the four discs were badly stratched and made it impossible to watch several of the episodes. The disc would just sit there and then skip a large part of each episode so I was totally confused as to what was actually happening. I order from Amazon all the time and this is the very first time this has ever happened and I was extremely disappointed with this purchase."
4,A splendid performance,"On this recording Jan Van Landeghem shows a touch of delicacy combined with superb virtuoso. The instrument itself, a recent build, is well suited for Baroque music. The stop selection may occasionally be a bit 'heavy' but this is merely a matter of personal taste, and most of the time Van Landeghem stays within a rather traditional sound frame. For a good and varied sample of mostly German organ music this is an excellent buy!"
4,Good but dated.,"Although the DVD for this program has only recently been released, the original date of the broadcast was in the 1980's. If you're a novice like me that doesn't matter because the basic elements of gardening probably won't have changed that much and there is a lot of very good information on the DVD. The host is an elderly English gentleman so his use of language is a little bit different than the American English with which we colonists are familiar, but he does not say anything you won't understand. You might want to consider the ""Rebecca's Garden, Volume 2 - Rose Gardening"" DVD as an alternative. The source material is newer and the host speaks in a comfortable (for me) American idiom. Either DVD is about the same in length of time at just under an hour, they both are priced about the same."
1,I wish I hadn't bought this!,"I must say that I really regret buying this book. After waiting anxiously to receive it I was, upon opening it, almost immediately disappointed. It turned out to be an alphabetical listing of companies which produced die-cast models, with a brief (1 paragraph in some cases) description of company history. While it does list each model produced by the various companies and offer a valuation, it fails to describe the models in any detail. Therefore, a prospective collector has virtually no useful information to go on. It doesn't even tell you the various colours the models have been released in, or any details which might differenciate one model from another.As for photos. This is another area where this book falls down. Very few graphics; once again - a real let down.All in all, a very poor showing. Save your money and buy a different book!"
4,Excellent overview of ALL diecast cars ever made,This book is not a complete listing of any single make of diecast car (although it does come close for a few makes) but rather a list of all diecast manufacturers that have ever existed with a representative sampling of prices and photos.
3,"Good, but lacking","No documentation anywhere online to show this card only supports up to 1 Gb of SD memory. A call to tech support and they basically told me ""tough luck."" Doesn't anyone sell a PCMCIA adapter that supports at least 2 Gb of SD memory?"
2,Does not read Memory Stick Pro Duo using MS Duo adapter,"Will read my SD cards fine, but will not recognize the Sony MemoryStick PRO Duo card (either 1GB or 4GB) using the Duo adapter. Contacted company for an updated driver for the card reader. They suggested I look for a new driver from my laptop manufacturer !? (IBM) or from Windows (!??!). No help. No drivers. No luck."
3,NOT AS PICTURED,"just received today am actually using this jet air filtration system in my house in the house wanted to try this for smoking otherwize electrostatic filter is great for dust will see how this works for that but is not as pictured, comes paper framed and looks similar to electrostatic one without the metal support but actual filter is much stiffer"
1,DVD Creation,"If you plan on using this to create your own DVD's, be aware there are limitations. Menu titles are truncated, MPG encoding is minimal. I was a Roxio fan until I purchased this version. The free software that came with my DVD burner works better."
1,Don't Bother,"Don't bother with this product. Roxio continues to have stability issues with this product. For a solid CD/DVD burning program, check out Nero."
1,Can't trust it!,"I have to agree with the review written by frashii on 02/12/2003, once I went to Win XP I had nothing but problems with the OS. I experienced crash after crash, then finally one morning I too could not boot my system past the bios. I had to reinstall XP with a new format and clean install. I chose not to try it anymore and I have had no problems with XP since. I like the features but it just doesn't give you any peace of mind. I moving on."
1,Software nightmare,"This is probably the most user-unfriendly software I've ever bought when it comes to creating music CDs. Everytime I needed to burn a music CD I had to go to the tutorial for the various steps. Version 5 was great compared to 6. The only problems with 5 is that it can't be used with Windows XP and you have to download a patch to fix the problems with it.I had no problem like others with installing 6. However some months after I did install it I started having problems with the ""drag and drop"" software. This is software that can be used to ""drag and drop"" any file (music or non-music) to burn a CD. It turned out to be a nightmare. CDs were not able to be finalized. When you install the drag and drop software it simply takes over for the CD burning method of Windows XP (which is far, far superior). I uninstalled the software and simply did a custom install by just installing the photosuite (the only useful thing in Creator 6)."
1,Not very user friendly...or with lack of support services,"I have to agree, I am very disappointed with the software and services...don't like the idea of talking to a computer or calling long distance. My biggest problem is losing all audio files when video is copied to DVD. I paid 100 for a DVD of an occasion and when I went to copy with this software, I lost all the original audio tracks on the tape:-(...mine was also buddled with Plextor DVD-burner. I have to think twice before I buy another of these products as I now am shopping for something better to replace this software...I also have Pinnicle and with the rendering and failing to copy over to the DVD, it's just about as bad...customer service is better though."
2,roxio cd creator 6,"cd creator is great for creating your own mixes, as well as for some fairly sophisticated editing of WAV files. be forewarned, however, that this software can cause serious computer crashes. as you read users' reviews of various roxio cd creator versions you will notice lots of people complaining about profound, major system malfunctions which they have experienced (this reviewer included). so, be sure to establish a restore point prior to installing.i only use the audio component of this software and use it intensively. version 5 was somewhat intuitive. version 6 is a mess! after struggling with this software for a few weeks, i reinstalled version 5.that said, the software packs a lot of bang for the buck, but don't expect it to be easy by any stretch of the imagination."
1,Roxio Never Again,All Roxio products I've used on several different operating systems have always had one problem or another. I found their support staff to be worthless and returned my last Roxio Product vowing to never buy anything they made again. I know others rave about Roxio but I think as with all products there is always a certain percentage of dedicated enthusiasts that will support the product regardless of problems. System lock-ups might be expected on slower cpu's with little memory but I've had some powerhouses freeze up with Roxio.
4,Roxio Easy CD/DVD Creator 6,I actually bought this item for a friend who has Windows Me on his computer and Creator 6 is compatible with that OS. It's a very good product and is easy to use.
3,not hat bad,"I read the previous reviews, bought a five dollar , new version off ebay to see if it would load and work. (that version does not burn dvd).Have a new sony computer, xp, dvd- and+ burner.program works fine. not as sophisticated as I need, but works just great. only one freeze up in four hours of hard editing.Would continue to use it if the text editor in stroy line were more useable. will try pinnacle next."
5,"Roxio, finally got it right",This new edition was easy to install and all features work great. I did not have any previous versions installed. Easy CD 5 Platinum was a nightmare so I was hesitant to purchase this edition. Roxio offers a 30-day money back guarantee even if you download it so buy it.
1,Once again the minimum one star rating fails to qualify,"Like so many burners these days, roxio has joined the ranks of useless programs. I myself have always tried to make a copy of my games so I can keep the originals in mint condition. I do this for two reasons: first, I sold mint colecovision games for 50$ a pop. Second"
3,Great Suite but has performance/bug issues,"This release is excellent in terms of features but the programme swallows system resources. I run a P4 2.4Ghz with 768Mb of RDRAM and 7,200 rpm disks but this release still noticeably decreased the performance of my PC due to the high number of tasks it laods. My system shutdown time increased from 10 seconds to 4 minutes (reported to Roxio). Stick with Version 5 until Roxio works out some of the issues."
1,Installation & Support Problems,"In short, the software does not install correctly and has also killed my DVD/CD Rom Drive.I am running XP on a Dell Dimension 8100. After installation, Norton Utilities shows that there are Registry items that reference missing Applications, DLLs, and other files types. My CD-RW Drive works fine, but my _NEC DV-5800A DVD\CD ROM drive cannot read any CD or DVD. The ROM drive will Spin occasionally and freeze any open drive windows until the disk is removed. Uninstalling Roxio returns the drive to normal.I can see from Roxio's Chat site that this is a common problem with this drive, but so far no fix has been offered. I have Emailed their support, but have only received an acknowledgement of the support request.The registry problems, the Drive problems and the poor support would indicate that this software is not ready for market."
1,You buy this and loose customer support,"Do you know if u ever need to get support, or to download a patch for your paid Roxio software, registration IS required from their website?! Yes everytime you need an software update/patch, you need to login with password. Registration needs an valid email address and your ROXIO software key. Thanks to this COMPULSORY registration I need to keep record for one more login/password combination. And Pray that you don't loose your cd key.BTW if your cdburner came with a bundle Roxio Easy creator, forget any update / support from roxio since you dont get a cd key. Somehow this is one evil way ROXIO try to get your business. if one day you upgrade your operating system and need to update for the bundle roxio software, you have to BUY the retail version Easy Creator."
1,Should be pulled off the shelves!!,"After reading the reviews, it is easy to see that I'm NOT the only one having all sorts of problems. Roxio ""Easy"" (LOL) CD/DVD Creator came bundled with my new TDK DVD burner. It has got to be the sorriest software I've ever attempted to install, with the exception of some freeware. It exposed hidden partitions, only partially installed, and I'm seeing the dreaded BSOD, telling me that there is a software or hardware conflict. Version 5 came with my computer, so I had to go back to using it. Also, ever since I TRIED to install version 6, ACDSee tries to act as Windows Explorer. I would advise any and everyone who is even thinking about purschasing this software NOT to. It's looking like I'm going to have to wipe my HD and start all over."
1,DVD Creator 6 installation disasters,"I'm both relieved and bummed to find so many others have experienced the same catastrophe I did in installing this product. It came bundled with a DVD burner from one of THE top names in the industry, and it shuffled my folders across my partitioned hard drive like a drunken poker player. Windows even lost all sight of a 60gig external hard drive -- it would dutifully ""beep"" in hardware recognition when I unplugged and replugged the drive into its firewire port, but the drive itself might as well have been in the Phantom Zone. Until Roxio makes clear -- In. No. Uncertain. Terms. -- that this issue has been fixed, I would not recommend the product to anyone but my boss at work."
1,When Good Software Goes Bad,"I have been using Easy CD Creator 5 Platinum successfully for quite some time. I tend to go for updates of a product when I'm happy it. So, I ordered Easy CD Creator CD & DVD Creator 6 Platinum at an excellent price from Amazon.Big mistake! I find that it is unstable -- sometimes working, other times freezing my system (Microsoft XP Home). The worst thing about it, however, is that it refuses to read CD-RW disks that were written with Creator 5 and read absolutely FINE with Creator 5. That was the last straw!I do have something positive to say about the Easy CD Creator CD & DVD 6 Platinum. It uninstalls well. Now excuse me while I get back to using my reliable, if not as capable, Creator 5."
1,Just a toy,"I've been using Easy CD Creator since version 2 that came bundled with my first burner, and they (Roxio) should've left well enough alone a long time ago. In version 6 they basically removed all the tools that I used in the package, except for what they've chosen to now call ""Creator Classic"". I never was able to figure out how to create a VCD (DVD Creator's help crashed every time I tried to look up 'VCD').Basically all the functions in version 6 are no better than what may have come bundled with your burner drive. Save your money."
1,Give it back to Adaptec,"They didn't have a ""0-star"" option or I would have used it. I've been using CD creating software since 1997, mostly from Adaptec. With this package I've produced more ""coasters"" than I did back in those days of $800 CD-burners, $8 CD-Rs, 2x record, and no buffer. I picked up ""Roxio's"" Easy CD Creator 5 as part of a system software package in 2002 and the first thing I had to do was download a service pack for WinXP. This particular version (6) only works when it wants to. I'll give it this much, it wasn't hard to remove from my system. How can a company take a product, make it worse, and still continue to find buyers. That must be why I'm not in marketing or economics. I ordered Nero 6 Ultra instead. WinXP has a better burning package for free."
1,I shouldn't have done it!,"Since I bought a DVD burner, I thought it would be a good idea to upgrade to Roxio's ver. 6 from ver. 5. - BIG mistake! They took away most of the functionality of v5 and called it an upgrade. I have uninstalled this ""upgrade"" and went back to v5. I recommend you buy ANYTHING ELSE rather than waste $ on this. Their tech support was basically useless to try to answer any of my questions - they weren't even aware of the features in v5. Go with any DVD burning product from uLead and check out what you can do with DVD Xcopy. If you can get your hands on Roxio's v5, it's great for audio but stay away from v6."
1,Congratulations Roxio!,"I'd like to congratulate Roxio and the Easy CD & DVD Creator 6.0....For being the one and only software app that crashed my system running Windows XP!....And I've been running XP for over 2 years! Even after 2 updates from their website, and a COMPLETE driver overhaul, I still had to reach for the reset button. Stick to Nero 5.5 or better yet, if you're just burning audio CDs, get Feurio! (also from Ahead software) It's the best and less than half the cost."
1,Caused a total system crash on bootup,"Wow, I thought I made the right choice in buying this software instead of Nero's. But after installing this on my Win2K comp, it won't even bootup, not even in safe mode! I get a BSOD (blue screen of death) before I get to the desktop.Now I have to completely install EVERYTHING from scratch. That should keep me busy for most of my weekend.My computer has been running perfectly stable until I installed Easy CD & DVD Creator 6 Platinum Edition. I am trying really hard not to curse Roxio out about this as it is a family rated forum.I am considered a computer expert by family and friends. I know that this problem was not caused by anything I did wrong. So what ever you do:DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT! DO NOT SUPPORT ROXIO."
1,stay away from #6,I have been using version 4.02 and have had minimal problems.I bought a new drive and #6 was inside so I tried it.Didn't like it - went to put 4.0 back in and now it won't read the drives.says there are no correctly configured drives.When I turn #4 off the drives work fine.Roxio needs to be smarter than this.Do not buy Roxio junk.The support is sub-par and they leave you with self help skills.Which means - you figure it out we can't.thanks
1,The worst of All,"I received Easy CD Creator 4 basic which has never worked. Friends advised me to buy Easy CD Creator 5 Platinum which has never worked either. Their tech-support is rude and incompetent that have never been able to install their own software.Roxio is the worst breed of the worst. A friend of mine just got Easy CD Creator 6, which did not work too. Roxio's tech-support advised him to pay $35 if he wants his software fixed !!! Roxio makes buggy software and requires people to pay to try to fix it !!!! Roxio is really abusing of people."
1,"I despise this product with the heat of 1,000 suns.","This is the single most frustrating software package I have ever had the displeasure of grappling with -- and in this day and age, that is truly saying something. After spending approximately 15 hours, I have been unable to finish burning a complete disc (sessions stall; discs that are readable one minute are declared unreadable or even non-existent the next; even the smallest error can cause the process to start over as late as 90% into completion, etc.). The so-called help files are utterly useless. My system is supposedly compatible, but clearly it makes no difference: ""Easy CD Creator"" is none of those things -- neither easy nor capable of creating a CD. I will never buy another Roxio product, and hope to dissaude anyone from handing over a red cent to Roxio. It's enough to make me go back to analog recording."
2,A few warnings,"The maker neglects to mention that the CD inserts prepared and saved with Easy CD Creator 5 will not be formatted the correctly in this new version: you'll have to recreate any jewel case inserts you have on hand. No fix planned, according to their customer support. Also, the memory leak problem from version 5 is still present in version 6. (At least, I assume that's what it is: after burning several CDs, open programs start to malfunction just as if there was insufficient memory, and sometimes I get an insufficient memory message.) I've asked about this, but get no answer. Also, in the Label Creator, when you copy a picture object, apparently it's copied to a clipboard within the program, rather than the system clipboard, so you can't paste it into (for example) MS Word. This is a pain as you try to recreate your label inserts."
2,Screws up your Hard Drive,"I haven't used the program too much yet, but the one dvd backup I did make worked fine.My major qualm with the program is that upon installation, it seems to have partitioned my hard drive without asking me and for no apparent reason. I now have a FAT partitioned f: drive containing some system files. I could tell the installation had problems from the start because it kept flashing the same message and rebooting my computer several times.I have a 7 month old Dell machine running Windows XP."
1,Disastrous data loss in backup,"I used this software to backup my data onto a DVD+R 4X disk. I was stunned to find that although the size of the created DVD looked about close to the original data, many files were simply gone: their names were listed but their size were all 0kb.I strongly urge you not to use this useless junk."
1,Would have rated this 0 stars if possible.,"Warning: Do not install this product on your computer! (More generally, if you have any software by Roxio installed, and if it works, then do not try to upgrade.)You have been warned!In my case the end result of installing this software (exactly according to the instructions) was the blue screen of death, and a complete reinstall of windows was necessary. Search the web for more information. If you've already bought this product try to get your money back."
2,I switched to Nero...it is so much better,I foolishly bought the upgrade for Roxio. I've used Roxio for several months and it is just a collection of programs that do not fit well together. I finally switched to Nero. It is the only way to go.
3,"Easy to use with no errors, but poor Mpeg 2 encoding.","This is great if you want to make vcds and copy cds and stuff like that, but if you want to make your own dvds you might want to search for something with a higher quality Mpeg encoder. I use this and Nero for dvd authoring, this is a good program because you can edit out commercials and trim video clips, you cant do that with Nero or at least I havent figured it out yet. My only real complaint is when I output to dvd the quality of the video looks more like vcd, a lot of pixelation occures when things move fast on screen. With Nero the pixelation is minimal but you need a pre edited file to work with. If anyone knows of a software that will give me the best of both programs share the knowledge."
2,Don't buy if you want to burn DVDs,The CD burning part of the program works the same as 5.0. It is relativly good and I have had few problems.If you wish to burn DVDs don't waste your money. IT DOESN'T WORK. I have wasted 3 DVDs trying to get it to work and it just keeps crashing.
4,Easy CD Creator 6 Rocks,"The product is trully a digitally media suite as it claims .Yeah , Yeah there are crashes and bugs here and there ,which product doesnt have theese . I installed my copy which I had purcahsed at Frys and installed it on Win 98 . I like the new enhanced Creator Classic . It has cool features like burning multi disc data sets , ability to create Bootable DVDs , MP3 DVD Discs , . The label Creator has also trully been enhanced , abilty to print DVD covers is somethings I like a lot . DVD builder and Audio Central are new applications to this suite . Audio Central doesnt really compare to other audio applications out there . A lot of important options are buried under menus .DVD builder is also a great application though I am irritated with so many windows popping up ,really poor UI design.All in all its worth the investment . You can lose at the price you pay."
5,Great Product,This is a great product that should meet most of your CD/DVD creation needs. Installed in Windows XP Pro without any problems and every application is rock solid. Those that have problems installing in Win 2K or XP are probably experiencing permission problems. One great new feature is that the software will automatically add track numbers to your tracks as you drag the tracks into the order you want when creating a MP3 disc. I have used every version of Easy CD Creator since version 3 and the product gets better with every major release. Very good job Roxio.
2,"Great product, but forget receiving a rebate from Roxio","Don't buy this product if you're expecting a rebate from Roxio. Like several others, I, too, was denied the promised rebate although I met all the requirements outlined. And once denied, there is no earthly way to dispute this questionable business practice. I resubmitted my request for the rebate, carefully outlining their mistake in denying me, and have not even received the courtesy of a reply. I'm chalking it up to experience, and as much as I like the product, I won't be purchasing any updates."
1,Don't waste you money,"I bought this against the advice of several reviews on this site. It will make a nice looking DVD but it is very limited in my opinion.1) Won't allow you to combine video clips2) Won't allow you to rename the video clips that you capture. You can only do that in windows explorer.3) Any audio that you attach is limited to just a few seconds4) If you need any help with anything other than installation problems, you have to pay for it from day one.5)When you edit a clip, you can't keep what you cut out, it automatically discards it.It's OK, but not worth the $ I paid for it. I am going to find a real DVD capture and edit program and get rid of this."
1,A Genuine Stinker,"I got this software with a terrific Plextar PX-708UP disk drive. Why they include ROXIO I will never understand. Lot's of problems. It doesn't work along with Redxpress Express Copyware 3. After using Redxpress once, the computer would recognize the DVD drive, but the ROXIO program wouldn't. The exact same thing happened with my two machines, both equipped with Windows XP. Don't buy it. Ive consistently found ROXIO products to be low rent. The pits. Go with Nero."
2,Rotten customer support,"This software looks as if it has real potential but didn't deliver. I had problems burning CDs from the start. I've been working with their tech support on and off for about 6 MONTHS and have yet to get the program to work. Their tech support is horrible, it takes weeks to answer my emails and they sent standardized solutions that didn't even address my problem. Phone support costs $35. If it worked it would be great software but it doesn't work and support is useless."
1,Major scare,"After I installed this software on my XP computer over last weekend, I found that my hard drives assignments were completing changed and I was not able to run my applications. Hidden partitions also showed up as newly assigned drives. Luckily I was hands-on with computer enough to go to the maintainance mode and correct the problems.When I tried to compile new projects for data backup , the program hanged numerous times. What's worst was that not all data were written on the disc and the program did not flag any warnings."
1,Not the best choice,"I purchased my copy around 4 weeks ago and spent several hours each weekend trying to install it. I have downloaded the 49MB of updates but they won't install either.Before laying out cash for this software, or any other similar products, check out the manufacturers websites and look at the customer complaint/problems section as an indicator of how good their product is. If you check out the support forum at Roxio you will see that this product has more than the average when it comes to bugs and problems.I wouldn't recommend this to anyone. There are other similar products on the market much more worthy of your money."
1,Worst software yet!,"I bought this software to update my sytem from the Roxio CD/DVD creator 5 Basic that came with my new computer. Worst mistake ever! This thing has so many bugs and glitches that if they had a patch for everyone they should call this Raggedy Andy! System freezes, error messages, etc. None of this has anything to do with reading or not reading directions, it is fairly easy to understand and use...it just doesn't work!!! I am getting my $$$ back and going back to the basic for now or buying a new program altogether......"
1,You'll be sorry!!,What the box doesn't tell you is that your drive has to be supported for the software to work. My drive was not. Installation was a total disaster. A virus would not have done as much damage. The promised support was nonexistant.
4,"Easy, but still some missing features","This is a great product and worth your money. Though it has a few problems.1. In Audio Central-it makes to many duplicates of audio when changing the kbps or when retriving it from other media software. You can delete it, but it takes forever.2. Make sure you send in [any] rebate immediatly...3. DVD Creator needs more features but still is 5 stars for ease of use.Overall, i recommend this product for household media-not steven spielberg films..."
2,Expected better!,"I upgraded from version 5 to 6 to include the ability to write to DVD. If you plan to place music on your DVD, you are limited to only one audio file, obviously leaving you without sound for the rest of your DVD creation. I have learned that you can get around this by getting an additional program (VideoWave or Sound Editor) and combining audio files into one. If you get this program, plan on the extra expense for other software."
1,Crashed my computer,"When I installed it, it asked to be rebooted. When it rebooted it knocked out my computer would not reboot. I had to do a system restore but it rebooted into minimum resolution and 16 colors. Trying to change the display settings to a higher resolution and more colors was unsuccessful. Technical support for my video card could not find a solution. Reinstalling Windows did not solve the proproblem. It looks like I will have to do a clean install and reinstall over a 100 applications. When I installed Easy Creator I had no programs running in the background so that was not the problem.Easy Creator has always given me some problems. It is a tempermental program to begin with. I had hoped that Roxio would have solved these problems in the most recent version but it looks like Roxio only made the problems worse."
1,1038 registry errors,"Had basic 5 version, which gave me problems. Tried to upgrade, blew the hard drive. Norton said 1038 Registy errors. Talked with computer shop, found that the errors ""not unusual""."
1,BE VERY VERY CAREFUL !!!,I BOUGHT THE UPDATE DISK FOR PLATIUM 5 AND MY SYSTEM CRASHEDBOUGHT THIS VERSION AND MY SYSTEM WORKED THE FIRST TIME BUTIT CRASHED AGAIN I WAS USING XP PUT IT ON MY OTHER SYSTEM WHICH HAS ME NO PROBLEM MY OPINION THIS VERSION [STINKS] ROXIO SUPPORT WAS NO HELP STILL WAITING FOR A RESPONSE ( 30 DAYS AND COUNTING )
1,Caveat Emptor (Let The Buyer Beware!),I've had years of experience with Roxio (nee Adaptec) products; most of the experiences were frustrating. Prospective buyers would do well to heed the warnings given by a couple of the featured reviewers.
1,"Possibly the ""buggiest"" software I have ever had to use","Roxio's so-called ""Easy CD Creator"" is anything but. It is perhaps the ""buggiest"" software I have ever used. It crashed my Windows XP system immediately upon installation. Even after a series of patches were downloaded to allegedly fix the problems, the software has continued to behave in a quirky and thoroughly unreliably manner. For example, lately it has begun refusing to burn more than half a CD. In sum, nothing but one frustration after another."
1,No customer support,"I have had no trouble with this product, but have little experience burning CDs. After several attempts to contact customer support, I still have heard nothing. Their website directs people like me to go here and there, just to end up right where I started.I think the software might be okay. I give this product only one star because their customer support is non-existent. If they would answer me, maybe I would have a better idea if it is good or not. If you think you might ever need customer support, I would suggest you buy a different brand."
1,Bad Product Bad Customer Service,"After 5 e-mails & 4 telephone call to resolve problems related to downloading latest revisions, program crashes, all I got was conflicting info for resolving problems. Most important reason for buying this product was to make a slide show, bad choice.Had to import 7 individual updates which were put on their web site Sept. 2. 2003 and their tech service did not advise me about them.Present stadus: DVD Builder unstablePhotoSuite: locks up systemPurchased with rebate, they want to dump this product.Rather than do the right thing and correct problems they are now going to release CD Creator 7 , do I have to buy a new issue to resolve problems?"
1,Great in theory....If it works!,"I recieved this product about 4 months ago. Installed it on my Dell 1.3. It would not function properly so I uninstalled it then reinstalled it and low and behold..... still not functioning. It will not recognise drives on my system so I emailed Roxio with my situation (quickly as the free tech support is only free for a very short period). They responded... This is a very technical issue, please call our tech support line. My dime. In the mean time my dell got hit by lightning and I installed it on my new 2.8 W/ gig of ram. It finds the drives now but will not even do a simple task like ""copy cd"". The free version of nero express which came with the cdrw works wonderful. What a waste of money. Yes the free support time has ended for me so I'm throwing it in the garbage!!! Keep up the good work Roxio!!!!!!"
1,DVD Creator Ripoff,"Don't expect any kind of tech support from Roxio. My TSID number for some unknown reason was not recognized, so I was not able to access their ""free online assistance"". My option was to pay ""per problem"" assuming I could spend the time getting connected for help. Both audio and visual playback quality of captured video clips was horrible. I was unable to burn, as it repeatedly froze up after encoding. I have given up on Roxio and will hunt for options that actually work as intended. What a waste of money!"
1,Back to the drawing board,"This is without a doubt the worst program, in any category, that I have ever used. It frankly does not work let alone work as advertised. It consistently stops burning and displays error messages. There is no way to correct them. I have tried burning at speeds from 40x down to 8x. Nothing works. I've tried different media and Roxio's ""smart burn."" Same results. The same applies to disc copying. I've trashed at least 2 doz or more perfectly good CDs trying to get this thing to work. I was able to burn 1 CD. It took almost 7 hours and left off the last 2.5 tracks. Tech support is worse than useless, they don't even respond to email questions. Save your money and don't bother with this program. It is a total waste."
1,"If you run XP, this is useless","Roxio does it again with poor XP support. Buggy, constant lock ups. Total garbage.Hey Roxio: XP has been out for well over a year. Make your software work with it or fade into obscurity."
1,no support and they don't care,"Product does not remove previous edition, and does not load. when calling the support center you may have to wait up to an hour to talk to someone. then you are put on hold again, to talk to a service rep/tech which means another 30 to 40 minute wait. And then the problem is still not resolved. Undoubtedly, this company does not care about customer support or service. Additionally, it would appear that the company is sending out a beta version of the program as a 'tested' version, because the first update is is over 6 meg in size."
5,Easy CD Creator Trouble Free,"I have installed this software version on a minimum of four desktop and one laptop running Windows XP Home Edition and one desktop running Windows 98. Three I did the install directly over a previous version of Roxio's product, the other three were clean installs. I have experienced absolutely no problems. My main use is for writing CDs. It does that with no problem.Don't purchase it with unrealistic expectations. It cannot circumvent copy protection of DVDs and if that is your expectation, you will be disappointed. I have made music CDs from it and they work beautifully. It automatically can determine the speed for recording. That is a definite improvement of previous versions where it would ruin many cds until you figured out there was a problem with the record speed."
1,Crashed a lot and isn't compatible with newer hardware or operating systems.,Crashed a lot and isn't compatible with newer hardware or operating systems. I ended up buying Nero and giving this away.
3,Chapters,The one video weakness that I found is if you have a long video you cannot realistically make chapters. You need to use their 'split' process which keeps the entire file. The problem is that if you take a 2 hour video and split it into 20 chapters you escentially have a 40 hour size file to process. I ended up with a 260Gig file to process with what started as a 4gig file. The product is ok when putting small clips together but not for any large serious work.
3,Not Impressed!,"Having used version 5 Platinum, I was filled with joy to see the release of version 6. I probably should have saved my enthusiasm. Although I haven't experienced any of the problems that I've read about here as far as Windows XP goes, it runs flawlessly on my XP system and I'm using it on a laptop. My issues are simpler. I just don't care for the way it works. Photosuite is worthless, Audio Central is ok, but you can't apply any effects (and there are several)such as the equalizer or any of the others unless you create playlists. If you want to listen to a few songs from your ""library"", you can't apply the EQ without first creating a playlist. DUMB!!!! I still haven't found an audio application that I like better than Musicmatch.I could go on, but if you don't have a real need to burn DVD's and you have version 5, stay there. I haven't decided whether or not I'm keeping this. Fortunately I bought it at Costco, so I have their liberal return policy on my side."
1,ROXIO Strikes Again!,"I am a heavy user of older Easy CD Creators. I've utilized v.3 & 4 & have sucessfully created hundreds of CDs with them. So after finally setting aside my P2-350 for a nice P4-2.4G/1GB RAM w/DVD-RW+R running XP, I was happy to see v.6 out.Talk about a nightmare! Two days, 12 reboots, tech support from Roxio with instructions on how to fix it that didn't help ...and back to the store I went for money back which I got with no problem and a sly smile from the clerk. H'mmm......Avoid this product at all costs....I find it hard to believe that Roxio released this piece of junk with more bugs than a street light in August."
1,Want marginal customer support? Buy any Roxio product!,"I purchased the Easy CD & DVD Creator 6 Platinum Edition in November 2004, after Microsoft's SP2 for Windows XP made my Basic 5 version unusable. I've been exchanging emails with Roxio Technical Support ever since. I can burn a data CD only to a CDR (for some reason ECDC 6 does not recognize my CDRWs). I cannot copy a CD using the Disc Copier function. For some reason the ECDC 6 recognizes my burner only through the Creator Classic function.What is wrong with companies these days? They grab the money and run. Never mind whether the customer gets the functionality they are paying for.I'll be looking into Nero or Sonic, which I've heard positive comments from live users.Amazon.com, on the other hand, is one customer-oriented company!"
2,lost spin doctor,This version has Audio Central which does not have near the functionality of the old spin doctor. Creating a wav file at 10mb/min isn't worth the upgrade. I just want my mp3. I'm going back to 5.
1,After installing made a complete mess of my Sony Software.,"This software in not a measureable improvement on their Basic Roxio 5.After installing Roxio 6, I experienced so many problems with my installed software that I had no choice but to abandon the Roxio 6. To those out there who have Sony software installed, DO NOT ATTEMPT the installation of Roxio 6.Reading their incompatible guide at their Web site, I'm amazed that Roxio will run in tandem with any comparable software.I award one star, 'cause the system will not allow a lower rating."
1,"As every one said, this is a piece of JUNK","This software was given to me as Christmas gift now I am trying to register it, but ... The TSID (Technical Support ID) is not valid and I can't update the software (because it's not registered). I checked roxio.com but all they answered me was no help for me! Let me give you an advice, DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS!"
1,Do not waste your money,"I have used Roxio CD creator 5 for the past year and was very pleased with it. When my husband and I decided to reload our OS I figured we'd try the next step up. What a mistake! Version 6 takes forever to install, caused my pc to take forever to perform restarts, and won't even open. After uninstalling and reinstalling I still had the same problem. I plan on demanding my money back from Roxio and sticking to good old version 5. I definitely do not recommend this product. I only wish I had read the reviews here at Amazon and on Roxio's own website before wasting my time on this software."
1,Might be ok if it would work,"After installing the program on my pc running windows xp professional, start up screen would appear but none of the options would run. Trying to contact techical support was a joke. The supplied technical support id number was not recognized by their database so I'm stuck with no working program and no working support. If I could, I'd give it a minus 1 star rating."
3,Mini Millennium Falcon,"This Lego Star Wars Millenium Falcon comes in a TINY box - it has very few pieces to it; but, my son wanted nothing for Christmas except the legos Falcon and we just couldn't come up with 300+ to get the huge one - this dinky one used to be in the Dollar stores for just that - a dollar - but, supply and demand - it is now $50!! I think it is a total rip off, but am hoping my son will enjoy it anyway, until he can save up for the ""real"" falcon later. If he wanted even a BARBIE for Christmas, I would not have gotten this cheap replacement. (But I may have been looking for a good psychiatrist) LOL."
3,Don't Put Too Much On It,"I really liked this coat rack. It's got a really nice finish, and it's a pretty good height. I'm around 5'9"", and putting a coat on any of the pegs seems really natural. I've put hats, scarves, track jackets, shirts, belts, and winter coats on them. They all stay on the pegs pretty well. However, with a large overcoat, the stand can be a bit unstable, and bumping into it can tip it over. Unfortunately, in the process of testing the stability, I actually broke the stand. I put two coats on each peg, and the bottom of the stand just splintered at the junction between the trunk and the legs. A bit disappointing because I really liked this one, and I felt that two coats could easily be a reasonable load. Nevertheless, this was pretty inexpensive so I can't complain too much."
5,Good Product and good price,The product looks good compare with its price. The coat rack stand is stable. The good thing is we can remove the middle section of the coat stand and make it shorter if we want.
4,Love,I love my coat rack. I was a little skeptical about it coming in parts but it has held up nicely.
4,"easy to assemble, lacquer a bit flaky","Assembly was easy. I was going to say ""trivially easy,"" but there's an optional metal plate that helps hold the legs in place. It took some fiddling to get the screw's threads to catch when the plate is present. Instability with the legs was one of the weaknesses of my old coat rack, so I wanted maximum reinforcement here. Even so, assembly took all of 5-6 minutes. It was almost disappointingly easy.The cherry finish is nice, but the lacquer had a blister that was starting to crack right out of the box. It hasn't flaked off yet, as far as I've noticed. It won't be a big deal for me if it does, but for some people it might.Ideally, I'd like it to be more stable. The cat has managed to knock it over once already. He is resourceful that way.For the price, it's hard to complain too much. I think I'd have to spend much more to get something appreciably nicer."
5,Wonderful coat rack,"I purchased this for my daughter's room when I saw that all her jackets were heaped in a pile (she didn't want to clutter our hall closet with them). It screwed together in a matter of seconds, and is much nicer than the photo depicts. Terrific product; would have expected to pay double for what I got it for. Very sturdy and holds a lot of coats."
1,It broke!,I bought this coat tree in the middle of January of this year. On April 29 I sent an email to company telling them that it had broke and they did not even bother to reply. I really liked the look of this item but we did not even have all the pegs with coats and yet it snapped in two. I am very unhappy with the product and very dissappointed with this company!
3,More managerial than Technical,"After read this book book, I found many managerial strategy that we need to apply on administering system (Not just LINUX). I got many idea on administering system from this book and applied it (also for NT). I think this book is good for someone who want to do system administrator job. For more technical information you still need to read Linux Howto and other references."
3,Linux Expert's Book,"Linux System Administration AUTHOR: M Carling, Stephen Degler, James Dennis PUBLISHER: New Riders REVIEWED BY: Barbara RhoadesBOOK REVIEW: This book reminds me of a college text. You read and read until the information sinks into your brain. There are no side notes or tips or examples. This is a book where the reader should have a solid knowledge of Linux and what they want to do before buying it.Linux System Administration contains: a 7-page Content, an 11 section Appendix, a 40-page Index, front and back cover have flap extensions for marking you page, and print that is fairly easy to read. Anyone who already has a grasp of Linux will find this book useful."
3,Looks cool on but breathing holes in wrong place,This looks cool on. The mask is what makes the costume look cool but the breathing holes for the nose are up way too high. My son wants to keep it and it will look good in pictures but I'm betting he will take the mask off pretty quick.
2,"Ok, for Halloween",The costume was okay. The material was thing and started to fray a bit (strings started to be visible after two wears). Just an okay purchase.
2,"overhyped, over wrought, too painful to finish","dont believe the hype--several of these poems display a marvelous avoidance of SOUND and SENSIBILITY. rather, they read like little rants. She does have some funny lines but overall, she could have benfitted from a good editor. Clearly she is in way over her head with a project like this. And it shows."
5,did anyone actually receive this from amazon?,"I've had mine on order for quite a while... got a ""back ordered - we'll keep trying"" email... was just wondering if amazon actually received any of them... they're pretty rare!"
3,Vintage Squires,"The collection on this CD is vintage Dorothy Squires. Quality, but dated recordings. If you are a collector of original recordings with the quality of CD sound, or an avid Dorothy Squires fan then this is fine, but if you want to hear the full impact of this artiste's quality, then a more modern collection is needed. Most of the recordings on here are from around 1940 and have been greatly improved by modern techniques, but her re-recordings and newer recording from the 60's/70's and 80's give a better example of the great performer."
4,"Condition as described, thanks!! Great Read","I love all of Betty Smiths Books, These have not been re-published and getting an in tact copy was great. Thanks"
5,The Lady knew how to Write,"Betty Smith was a writer who could draw you into her characters. You feel as if they become a part of you, and you think of them long after the book is finished.I was happy to discover this book, and found it to be extremely entertaining and enjoyable.You will enjoy reading about Maggie-now and her life.My only regret is that the talented Betty Smith is no longer alive to write more novels. She had a gift."
1,I wanted to puke,"This book made me sick. When Betty Smith wrote this book, there was something wrong with her. Compared to her book A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, this was trash. Don't waste your time, or money."
3,not as good as the original - but a hard act to follow,"Let's face it, for most of us who grew up playing D&D 20 odd years ago, the Keep on the Borderlands was the first adventure we all played. I was really looking forward to this re-write because i'd played the original so many times my PC's knew it back to front: eg, (DM)""you see a pair of shapely legs around the corner"" - (PC)""look out, it's that Medusa again!!"". So taking your players through this adventure is certainly a surprise for returning players. The background of the keep and recent developments in the area are great additions to the original module. Criticisms are that it is a bit too hard for 1st level players, and the silly Minotaur maze which somehow got excavated within the existing caves without anyone noticing. I just ommited that part entirely. In summary, a good game but not as good as the original."
3,"It's good, not great, but good","""Return to the Keep on the Borderlands"" is a good, challenging adventure. Being a reformation of the original adventure that came with the original boxed set of the D&D game, it helps new gamemasters at their craft.However, Yeomary was one region I needed more detail on, but the detail about the keep wasn't lacking at all.It's a challenging adventure for player characters played by dungeon hackers, but those players who wants a great plot will have to depend on the DM to provide it.Other than that, the adventure is awesome. And this is coming from a guy who started roleplaying in D&D at age twelve (1986). I highly reccomend it to any one who wants a good night of casual play."
2,Out of place in todays market,"So much could happen in a keep on the borderlands, and to the books cridit it describes the keep itself quite well, as well as a few of the local dangers (i.e. bandits and Gnolls).Where this book really falls down though is in the caves (where much of the adventuring will take place), each one is just a poor dungeon crawl, with the main motivation being pest extermination.Despite supposedly being set in Yeomanry, there is no detail whatsoever about the region.Whilst this kind of adventuring might be some peoples cup of tea, if you dont like sterile dungeon hacks then avoid this product."
5,Cheap and easy duplex printing,The printer set up very quickly and easily on a Netgear print server (this one can be shared on a network unlike it's sibling Kx-p7100). For a duplex printer it is very compact and doesn't need access around it or behind it. It prints duplex flawlessly and has a great feature that shrinks the pages down to 4 pages on a side or with the duplex 8 pages total on each page. It's a great way to save paper to review rough drafts. I did have an initially bad start when the printer was jamming all the time with 28lb laser paper; but after switching to cheaper 20lb copy paper it hasn't jammed once. A great value (I considered the cheapest HP duplex printer but it was almost twice as much and a lot bigger in size and I don't think it has the great shrink-down-to-4-pages-on-a-side feature).
4,So glad these are metal!,"My old Closetmaid U-clips were plastic and many have broken over the years. These metal ones should last. Personally, I recommend not using the drywall anchors that are supplied, but drilling into studs wherever possible. It will be worth it in the long run. The shelves LOOK so sturdy, and they are -- so it is tempting to keep piling the weight on. What will fail ultimately are the anchors. I did not install our original shelves, they came with the house, and 4 of ours have failed."
3,Average,"The picture was misleading; I assumed the book would have a black cover. Instead it was a ghastly neon green. To be fair it was written in the description, which I only saw after I received the book. It was in good enough condition: some folded corners, cover was a little beat up, but nothing too drastic."
2,Okay if you Like SICK & Twisted - But not for young readers,This was a bit of a shocker considering it is reccommended for young readers. Roald Dahl is Y2K's answer to Poe. His stories are sick and twisted and too deep for younger kids. Adults should definitely read prior to sharing with their child to make sure they feel it is appropriate. My son loves HP - but would find these stories disturbing.
4,Such nice little stories...,"Roald Dahl is such an endearing writer. His stories seem like cute little childrens stories, using very basic vocabulary and a style that does not even allude to being poetic. But then the plot twist at the end of each leaves you wondering how his sick mind comes up with these ideas. After the first 2 or 3 stories you start expecting the plot twists, and you find yourself wondering how he will spin the story you are reading into something dark and disturbing - and this curiosity drives you straight to the end of the story before you know it.A good book that you will be able to put down, but I doubt it will take you more than 11 sessions to finish - I simply can't imagine putting this book down mid-story."
5,The enemy you always wanted Makuta,"He is a great foe, now you could use him for Halloween, the Master of shadows. He seeks the ""Mask of Light"" cause he's afraid his spell on Mata Nui would fade. Since he's chest and legs can open you can attach three Kraata's in there. He carries the double bladed staff of shadows and wears the mask of shadows. enjoy this big,evil, and mean bully to your Bionicle collection."
5,Makuta,We love Makuta. He was not difficult to build. He is a fantastic bionicle!! We look forward to his battle with Takanuva.
4,You Go Michael!!!,"Only ignorant dumb a$$es say things like ""michael has no talent"".He has such a beautiful voice you can't help but to listen and be impressed, You can hear the pain in his voice and that he knows and believe what he's singing."
1,Nessun Dorma? Please....,Another CD proving Michael Bolton can't sing. He does sound like he's in pain and he only furthers our pain.
4,Just what I needed,Even though it took longer than expected the book came to me in excellent condition.
4,A children's humourous classic,Devastatingly accurate and funny picture of primary school life and one child's attempt to beat the system. Tyke's determination to protect dim Danny from his educational fate is the spark that sets the story ablaze - but the 'identity-kick' in the last chapter is the knockout!Aimed at 8-12 year olds
1,Don't buy this,"I was hoping for a review of social studies themes, but was sorely disappointed. In the ""What to Study"" section, it lists no less than 34 texts, none of which were available at my local library. I'm studying for a test, not completing my major! The writing tips (like ""Read through the question carefully"" and ""Do not give incorrect information"") were not helpful. The practice questions and test structure information was redundant with the IDS website. I took the test in July '08 and found the quickstudy.com academic outlines to be much more helpful. If it's in your local library, I could see scanning it or using the practice test, but the content is not worth paying for!"
3,"The book's fine, the price is outrageous","This book can be purchased directly from the ETS company for $35! And yet, it is being sold for over $90 for new and $70 for used. What's up with that?"
2,Get most of the info for free on ETS website,"I took the Social Studies Pedagogy test (0084) and didn't pay any attention to the other chapters of the book. This review only pertains to the three chapters related to that test.I would not bother with this book if I had it to do over again. All of the important information about the test format and grading is available for free on the ETS website. I'm pretty sure one whole chapter was just copied and pasted from the .pdf available there. You get a couple more ""practice tests,"" but since the test is always the same ten questions these practice tests just amount to the names of some social studies themes, you could very easily make the same practice test yourself.Seriously, don't bother."
3,Jack of all trades - master of none,"This product covers several tests. As such, it only dedicates a few pages to each. The product helps the test taker hone in on what types of things the test scorers are looking for but due to its abbreviated length, stays in the theoretical. There is a practice test with sample responses and how they were scored, which is moderately helpful."
3,Read the above Review,"Thanks for your review and tip - I almost bought this book used for over $70 used not including shipping, but I saw your review and went directly to ETS - It is selling new for $35. Thanks for the heads up."
2,"A summary of Alexander's military conquests, little more","I picked up Mr. Hammond's book with the hope that it would delve into the personal traits and characteristics which made Alexander a ""Genius"". Unfortunately, this analysis was rarely offered and, when it was, was very simplimatic. I am confident this would be a great book for military historians since its descriptions of battles are detailed and comprehensive. For the rest of us, it is not very rewardin"
4,nice,"Mine is a little paler than pictured, with darker markings, so the appearance is not as uniform. Tacky green felt comes off with the slightest provocation. I chose this over the RSVP grey one because this is a little smaller and I really wanted to be able to nestle in the palm of one hand, which it does fairly well because it has no pedestal base."
1,Auto Ventshade 25849 Bugflector II Smoke Hood Sheild,Product Looks Nothing as Advertised.Was totally Disappointed!Sent it back as soon as possible!Would not recommend ordering unless they could provide better description's for their product's!
5,better than jerry springer,This is a good book. I have a deep appreciation for both Catholics and Evangelicals. I am not big into debates. I feel like the best way to debate is to debate on the oppisite side of what you beleive in. Different roads always open up that way and different ways to looks at things........Paradoxical. Plus emotion doesn't get in the way. Beleifs are saturated with emotion.The presentation is good from both sides. I however feel that no Christian denomination can know everything about God. I don't feel there is one right church. Many good Christians on both sides of beleif. They gotta be doing something right.Buy this book
1,On a scale of 1 through 5...Its a -5,"Form what I read of the book I'd like Fr. Waiss's credentials checked. He should have and could have cited much more scripture in this obviously Anti-Roman Catholic text. Mary Lk 1:28 and 48, Eucharist Jn 6:53-56, 1 Corinth 11, Faith Alone? read James 2:17, Bible Alone? read Jn 20:30, Jn 21:25, 2 Thes 2:15, What is the Pillar and ground of truth? read 1 Tim 3:15, Authority in the Church? read Hebrews 13:17. Not only did Waiss drop the ball, he simply handed it to McCarthy-- Matt 7:6 (which was the same last name as the 50's Sen. McCarthy who accussed without evidence.) I hope the anti-Roman Catholic Crowd takes some time to balance their obviously biased reading lists and read some Catholic books by some Catholic authors anything by G.K. Chesterton, John Henry Newman, Thomas Merton etc."
5,Good Debate -- Only One Conclusion,"This book is a good and interesting read that clearly points out the differences between Catholic and Evangelical theology. I am definitely on the Evangelical side of the fence because I believe that it is true to The Bible and the scriptures. There are more than enough scriptures to convince me that my salvation is by faith, and faith alone through the grace of God and the sufficiency of the sacrifice of Jesus Christ on the cross.The one conclusion I find inescapable is that the two positions --Evangelical and Catholic-- are mutually exclusive. That is to say if one is right, then the other has to be wrong. The Bible tells me the right one is the Evangelical position."
4,Like Ice Water After a Siesta,"Pastor Jim McCarthy and Fr. John Waiss made an admirable effort to engage each other not only on a polemical level, but on a human level and as men of faith. They discuss the great issues which divide Evangelicals from Catholics: Scripture - Tradition, who has teaching authority, how one obtains salvation, the meaning of Last Supper and the relation of the Christian to Mary, angels and saints. In a culture like ours, with its reliance on sound bites and quick answers, a book like this is quite remarkable. It's like diving into ice water after a siesta. Not for the timid. One small disappointment: McCarthy chose to conclude with a taunt: ""Your unquestioning loyalty to Rome, however, makes me question if you can interpret Scripture objectively..."" But I guess that underscores the fact that it will ultimately take something much greater than human effort to unite us as Christians."
4,Surprised and Fair,"Having read McCarthy's Gospel According to Rome, I expected more strawmen and one sided debates. Fr. Waiss did a very good job defending the Catholic faith, and Jim McCarthy also did a nice job and was charitable. I still dont like his assumptions of Catholics not being Christian, but that is his perogative. A very useful book."
5,This is THE book on Texas Parks,"I do not intend to write a lot about this book. I have camped/hiked in most of Texas' great parks. This is THE book to tell you enough about each to pique your curiosity in (or deter you from going to)any and all Texas State Parks.I have given this book to all of my friends who like to camp, hike, drive to and enjoy the outdoors."
1,Are you kidding?,"Beatles? Beach Boys? Pet Sounds? My dog howls better than that guy sings. Just because he puts ""God"" in his titles doesn't mean it sounds like two of the greatest rock and roll song writing groups ever. Where are your ears? This is a poor man's ELO at best, which is nothing compared to Lennon/McCartney and Wilson. Where is the melody? the hook? I'll say one thing - all the songs are consistent - they sound the same."
1,I got screwed,I thought I would be the only one that felt like the previous reviewers. I like Rick pretty much but this time after the cd finished playing I could not believe what jive I had just heard. I knew there were some make overs but it seemed like he could have done better at a jam session. No originality anywhere. Nothing to give me a spark. This has to be his worse album yet. I lost money on this one big time. I will listen to all the samples the next time myself also. Pitiful!!! Pitiful!!!
5,"Brings back the memories... great job, Rick!","This is a real feel good CD that brings back memories with each song. Rick plays every one with emotion and the songs make me smile. I especially love ""Daughters,"" ""Groove is in the Heart"" and the current single, ""Shining Star."" It's also interesting to read the liner notes to see what these songs meant to him. It's a great CD! The ""originality"" comes in the way he plays the music. And he does it so well!"
5,A fine covers album,"May i start by saying i had the pleasure of seeing this truly great artist play live in london about 6 years ago and can Honestly say it was one of the highlights of my twenty years of viewing live performances.What makes this album so special is his personal choice of tunes to cover.Great from start to finish the highlight being Brauns take on Sade's ""kiss of Life"" which i also happen to beleive is her best song to date and Rick more than does it justice , from the heart , pure beauty."
1,"Why did you this to us, Rick? Why?","Oh my god... how can be possible that such a talented composer had to fall in such deep nonsense, remaking a whole bunch of old tunes to end up like something much worse than even Muzak? This is the music you'll hear again and again at the supermarket, just sufficiently engineered to num the brain.Kiss of Life is the only light of hope (and that's why this CD gets 1 star - otherwise should be zero, or even negative!) but that's only because I love Sade."
2,Not Impressive at all!!!!,"I love the sound of Rick Braun but this new album doesn't display much originality. All songs are remakes, so what happened to his own music. He plays with class and sytle but it was not worth the money. Who wants to here remakes? Come on Rick, the last two albums are just weak. I suggest saving your money on this one. What is happening with the smooth jazz artist of today? Sounds like they are not spending enough time and money to get good material."
3,Ugh,"I managed to find a streamcast of some of this album and was unimpressed. I'm sorry, but an album of cover songs doesn't cut it. Rick has, and can do, much better than this."
3,Finally.....a trumpet artist!!!,"Yes, after years waiting on some musician to play some decenthorn... along comes RICK BRAUN and this CD proves iteself....Allthe new trumpters sound the same ole same with nothing to say and no intervention of quality and certainly with NO SOUL like Rick Braun. Only he consider what the song iteself is saying. This man reads the music it seems and gives it a true reading still being himself and one is able to identify immediatedly and appreciate just who it is and what it is!!!BRAVO!!BRAVO!!Not just one song worth anything on this release but this artistmakes every song himself although he's ready to share it with you if you listen......THANKS Rick...... and please keep it up!!"
1,"Move over, Lunesta","There's less than 42 minutes of music on this CD, and it is best described as insipid. I am a big fan of Rick Braun, but I will no longer buy a Braun CD before I hear the whole thing because all he's doing here is blowing for cash. It's uninspired, artless, and about as original and interesting as fast food. The next CD may be favorites from the hymnal..."
2,Don't Be Fooled!,"Wish I have read some reviewers comments before buying it. Very disappointing. Try ""Kisses in the Rain""."
3,New Barbie in DD's collection that she adores!,"I ordered this for my daughter as a christmas gift and she absolutely loves it! I didn't give this 3 stars only because, even though it works great I wish there was a button that you did not have to hold in order for the wings to work. I purchased this when it was on sale here for $6.99 and it was a great deal!"
1,dont waste your money,Thought we were getting something really cool for my five year old and it turned out to be a waste of money. You press a little button to watch glitter go through the wings. Big deal. I thought it had lights or something different.. Needless to say she doesn't play with it at all. SAVE YOUR MONEY.
1,Not nearly blue,Color was not even close to turquoise. It was closer to gray or pewter. However the antique gold was lovely.
2,Shoddy buggy battery eater,"This worked great when I got it-- it does save a lot of water when it works.But mine has a tendency to occasionally flick itself on and off once quickly when there's nothing in the sink. I came home one day to find it switching the faucet on and off every few seconds-- great.And when the batteries died the first time after a few weeks, I started to wonder. Then the second set died after another few weeks, and I just had to laugh-- having water is great, but tossing a few dozen batteries to run it is going the wrong way.I've wired mine up with a DC adapter and a switch plugged into a GFCI outlet, so it's only on when I'm at the sink. It works great, but I don't appreciate having to mod something just to make it work.Another company needs to get in on this-- EZ-Faucets are not ready for prime time."
2,Faulty Faucet,"We purchased a few of these for use in our lab here in Ann Arbor. They worked fantastic for a few weeks, but then they began to fail one by one until we lost use of all 3 of them. It is a great idea and very affordable, but their short lifespan made this purchase a waste of money. Do not buy this product until they improve the longevity. If and when they do, I will buy them."
1,Please sell your patent to someone else,"I have gone through a few of these. First one never worked. Second one worked fine with only one battery change for one year then died. Current one worked for two weeks and then drained the batteries. New batteries were placed in and were also drained within two weeks (they claim batteries should last 1.5 years). I am trying to exchange the item under warranty but it seems their customer service is intent on trying to convince people otherwise. They need to release their patent rights and allow other companies to improve on their design. This is the only product I know of in this price range, but $50 wasted is too much."
3,"Neat product, but low quality.","It leaks and requires regular tightening as it doesn't seal well with the kitchen faucet. Once it is working you have to be careful not to bump it or else it will start leaking again. When it is working though, it is pretty cool. Saves water and is convenient in the kitchen when your hands are full or dirty."
2,Very bummed!,"I was so excited to see an inexpensive way to make hand washing more fun and healthy for my kids. Hubby and I tried for 45 minutes to make it work someway, but the faucet continued to drip after several attempts at installation. Not a lot, but enough that we couldn't leave it on. I was very frustrated. From the other reviews, it sounds like others had a better experience."
2,"Good, but not durable","This product worked quite well for about 3 months. As others have reported, it then became somewhat more difficult to get the sensor to detect the hands, slightly annoying but still working. And then the sensor became quite difficult. Cleaning the faucet and changing the batteries did not fix these issues. Finally, the faucet turned itself on and stayed on - that would be scary if it happened when no one was home. That was the trigger for me to remove it from the sink and seek a warranty repair. However, be aware that EZFaucet charges a big $15 fee for shipping and handling (plus your return postage costs) for a warranty replacement/repair. I'd recommend this faucet for short-term (three month or less) use. But over say a year, it will cost you $15 every three months, and that starts to become an expensive appliance."
1,Simply Doesn't work,"I was very surprised to find that both of the units I ordered simply do not work. I mean not even a little. Other than an indicator light on the on/off button, both units are completely inert. This is the first time I ordered something from Aamazon and was disappointed with it."
2,Great--when it works!,"This item was a gift just under a year ago. I installed it easily, and enjoyed its convenience for about 10 months. But then it stopped working. The sensor did not work, nor did the on/off button. Although there was no indicator light that the batteries were bad, I tried changing the batteries. Nothing. I contacted the company, and they responded with an email with instructions on how to reset the device. I followed their directions to the letter, but it still doesn't work. As it was a gift I do not have any paperwork on where, when it was purchased. It lasted almost a year, but that's not a very long life. I don't think I would purchase another one."
2,Connection leaks,"After reading the reviews and visiting the manufacturer's website which stated that it has a new and improved model, I decided to take the plunge and buy this gadget. I was hoping we wouldn't run into issues (since it is the new and improved model) like some of the reviewers here experienced but I was wrong. The connection between the faucet and the gadget leaked constantly. We tried tweaking and adjusting but it still leaked. At one point of adjustment, it sprayed water everywhere. We've been looking for something for my 90-yr-old grandmother who forgets to turn off the faucet in the bathroom and the kitchen. I guess we will continue to search for something. I've returned it."
1,Don't buy this or any iTouch products,This product is pretty useless. I returned mine.I also tried their touchless towel dispenser; another big was of my time and energy. I returned that product as well.These are poorly designed and constructed products.
3,"Great concept, but too bad didn't fit","The automatic faucet itself is a great product, and it would have been even better if it fit the faucet head. It was a bit of a disappointment that, despite the claim on the box that it fits all types of bathroom and kitchen faucets, the adaptor did not fit my bathroom faucet."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT,"We do lots of hand washing in my home-based preschool. I was so happy to find a product like this, until I found out from experience how poorly they are made. After going through three of these adspters in three years, I gave up and bought a faucet with a built in sensor for under $50 that works MUCH better and actually looks just like a regular faucet (also sold on Amazon). These adapters are not built to last and are a waste of money."
1,looks good but beware!,"ITouchless look good, but what it does not tell you is, it will not fit every faucet, when i went to install this on my faucet it was to big, called there hot line to see if there was an adaptor, they told me to go to home depot, went to home depot no help, when to an ACE hardware and they had an adaptor. but after installing the Itouchless ez faucet leaks at the adaptor, have try a few things to try to stop the leaking, pipe tape, thread compound, etc no help, so i told the company they should supply fitting(adaptor) for all faucet size,i don't think they care. so I would beware of this product"
5,I'm currently taking voice lessons....,"And a few days ago, I saw a copy of the BSB music book. I bought it (of course) for $20 or so and my next voice lesson, I had brought it. My teacher likes the music and lyrics so now I bet he's practicing. I had let him borrow it (and it's PAINFUL.) and before that, I would study and practice singing and following the right key and pitches. It sounds great on the piano and lets me know all the lyrics. I love practicing BSB music, and I bet you would too! :)"
3,Hermes Sandals,"These are not my favorite shoes to dance in, however the company I dance with requires them. Too bad they have no support or cushioning. We get a lot of compliments on how they look, but the laces hurt and the flat sole does nothing to may your toe point look good. Danshuz is the only company I can find that makes these."
2,disappointed,I am really disappointed to see that this magazine is not available in e-reader form. I would love to have the option to read this magazine on my kindle.
3,Ebony Magazine,"This order was just like they said SLOW. It took a few weeks to get started. It was a gift, so I really could not send it any other way. If you are looking for fast results this is not the way to go. But if you person is able to wait, as mine was since he's in the service, then I guess this was ok."
5,Great for OSX Mac Users but ..,"I've been searching for the perfect External Hard Desk for my Powerbook for so long, each Product that was recommended to me I went online to read all the reviews about it and ended up fearing all other brands, until I came across (...) it reviewed the latest External hard desks, compared most brands cons and pros and the editors choice was: ""Iomega External Hard Drive FireWire 800/FireWire 400/USB 2.0 250GB, Black Series"".I decided to go for it and I'm so glad I did, it looks smooth, it ran very quietly and it was easy to use with its plug and play setting. It's also very fast and the huge capacity makes it the perfect has it all drive.The only negative things that I had a hard time with is to reformat it as requested in the manual, claiming that Mac OS X will not mount any DOS (FAT32) partition that is larger than 128GB. (...)But over all it's a great External Hard drive, I Highly recommend Mac users to go and get it."
2,BE VERY CAREFUL before buying this . . .,"Be careful. I've spent 4 hours in 'live chat' with their technical support to make this thing work. And it won't do what I need it to do. First, be careful -- it must be plugged directly into the wall socket(it won't work plugged into a power strip) and it needs a main USB port in the back of your computer unit (front, side, or alternate USB ports won't work -- less power to alternate USB ports they said). And the you have to download a 'PRO' version of the software hidden on their website in order to back-up your entire computer system. Be careful of folders within folders. Selecting individual files is very cumbersome and doesn't always capture the folders within folders. And, if you need to back-up another computer across a network -- this won't do it. According to Iomega tech support, Iomega doesn't have any product that backs up another computer over a network. Be careful. This is accurate -- but other printed things by Iomega don't pan out."
2,We're going back to LaCie,This did not work for us using FireWire on an iMac G4 running OS 10.4.8. It kept dis-mounting and in the end one partition (the one with our backup) completely disappeared! We knew none of this was normal as we'd used a smaller LaCie for six years with no problems whatsoever. Reaching tech support was horrible. The return (to J&R) was easy at least and we're back with LaCie.
1,"Lost my Win-XP, SP2 because of defects in this system","I purchased this hard drive in April 2007 and have been dutifully imaging my system using iomega's ""Automatic Backup Pro"" software that came with the driveMy computer's hard drive recently became corrupted. I thus booted my computer from the rescue CD with the drive attached, and attempted to restore the image of my disk -- but iomega's software was unable to find the image on the iomega drive. Bummer!Iomega's tech support now tells me their Automatic Backup Pro software was *never* compatible with Win-XP, SP-2. I have come to understand that I was sold a defective system under false pretenses. How can these guys look at themselves in the mirror?"
5,What a Life!!!,"What a life! Took me back to some of the earlier times when flying was even more fun than it is now. If you like aviation, you like this book. Well written, funny, historical. Shows how one man can make a difference and have fun doing it. Anyone interested in aviation has to read this book."
5,"Son, father, lover, student, teacher, pilot, ARTIST!",There is an art to flying well... there is an art to living life well... there is an art in doing relationships well... there is an art in growing old well... and there is an art in recording these events well... William P. Lear Jr is an artist who has not left one single square mm of the canvas of life unpainted. This book is a must read for anyone who has ever dreamed the dream of flight or taken it on head first. Thank you Bill
5,A MUST READ FOR PILOTS AND NON PILOTS ALIKE,"ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS I HAVE READ.ONCE YOU START IT, YOU CANNOT SET IT ASIDE.UNLIKE SO MANY BIOGRAPHIES WRITTEN THESE DAYS , THIS IS A REAL BOOK ABOUT A REAL GUY.WOULD BE NICE TO SEE IT PUBLISHED AGAIN."
4,Fly Fast Sin Boldly,"A fast and fun read. Specific names, dates and places regarding things and events normally edited out. No punches pulled. It is a must for anyone who ever sat in a pilot seat and fun and informative for those of us who only dreamed about it or wondered if the man at the stick knew what he was doing or prayed that he did. A steady stream of good humor by the guy who has been there, done that."
1,Bad Research?,"I bet the author didn't even study youth surfing the web.If he had, he might have realized that today's youth are *highly* literate (not illiterate). They are also increasingly critical.That is precisely *why* they are abandoning Network News. They know that it can't be trusted for the really important stuff, unless they're willing to drink the swill that is ""spin"".The new generation does not need to be ""inspired"". What needs to happen is for the older generation to realize that the web surfing habits of the youth are both social and educational, in that they increase global knowledge by facilitating social interation unbound by geography.20 years ago you learned about Vietnam by reading the paper.Now kids just logon to MSN/ICQ/AOL, find someone living in Vietnam, and initiate a chat.Does reading the paper *truly* provide a better indicator of what daily life is like in Vietnam?"
3,Not really needed.,"Ok all of us out there have a pretty good idea on how underwear should look and there's only so many different ways to draw them. I found the book to be a little dissapointing and seems repetative on the same subjects. What I did like the most was the fashion section through the ages starting with Ancient Egypt through to today. Though don't get too excited this section is 1/8 of the book and goes by quick. As for the rest, well I'd skip this one especially if you have a good imagination, you can come up with your own ideas as to how seductive or innocent your character's outfits should be."
4,a surprise,"It surprised me to see that in this volume, the autors showed details of the underwear cotums above my expectation. I was afraid that the volume would be limited to panties and underbras, but the authors showed all sort of costums and an historical view of the underwear in diverse historical periods. A gratefull surprise to such a simple subject"
3,I passed but its probably decent.?,I almost bought the book until i looked in it. It's basically drawing girls in skimpy sexy clothes. If You like that kind of thing then shovel out the 20 bucks. I'd recommend buying it here because its cheaper! I think if you want to find lingerie you could try using Victoria secret? I don't exactly get why theres a entire book for this one thing. it would be useful if you want to draw a Fan service-heavy manga maybe a Romance manga too but i;m not sure. If i have extra money i might consider it...i think it'd be nice to haver more guy sleepwear in it?
5,Great Paper at an incredible price,This paper works great with our HP Designjet 500. We print a lot of large banners and artwork turns out great on this paper. I do recommend that you allow plenty of time for the ink to dry on the paper before handling the product.
4,Good tool to have on your keychain.,"I have been using the Lexar Jumpdrive for about 3 years now. This purchase was for my wife. The jumpdrive allows her to bring files home for work, and store personal items for her needs.The jumpdrive the design is solid, if you are emailing documents or pictures I have found that it is faster to copy files to your computer and email them from that location do to the USB portal speed reducing file transfer times.This is my second one, and I would consider buying another one. The price break with rebates makes it quite affordable."
5,Great thumbdrive.,"I was able to get this last autumn for $50 after rebate. The fact that you can fit more than a CD-ROM's worth of data on this drive is killer.The USB 2.0 is rather necessary, though. If you're moving a large amount of data from one PC to another, you'll definitely want the 480 MBit/sec transfer capability of USB 2.0... USB 1.1 may take a few years. However, the backward compatibility is still pretty nice, if you're only moving 10 MB or less.I bought this before I knew of the JumpDrive MP3 player that Lexar makes. If you're really interested in adding MP3 capability later, it's only a $40 upgrade from this, which definitely enhances the value of this product.Overall, I've had no problems, so it seems to be reliable to me as well.It's a must-buy if you can find it for $60 or less."
4,Works great!,"Have had mine for 6 months and still going strong. Quick recognition of device, quick transfer rate, plenty of storage space. Love that you can attach it to your keychain. Call me a nerd, but something about always having a lot of storage space on me is reassuring :)"
2,Worked great... for a week....,"I bought this drive with the Lexar Jumpdrive Sport MP3 player and for the first week I was very happy. However this morning, a week after receiving the product, the flash drive stopped working completley. It won't work in the MP3 player or either of my computers. I treated it well, but I guess this is a problem with the flash drives. Be wary."
1,sudden failure,Had this drive for about a month. Slowerer than my 512 sandisk micro and did't fit as well in several slots.This jumpdrive sport is marketed as robust but failed after a month with a crack along the seam -- same as others report in various hardware forums. I treated it pretty carefully so I was suprised.
3,Cap Removal,"I'm not technologically proficient, so I'm pretty happy when I receive a device I can just plug in. However, it took me about 5 minutes to figure out how to remove the cap from this sucker. This difficult removal is probably why other customers have reported cap splitage.Anyway, to remove the cap, grasp the rubber tag next to the blinky light thing, and pull toward you. Hard. This will loosen the surrounding rubber stuff which will in turn give you the ability to take off the cap.God speed."
2,I expected a lot more...,"I got this cookbook not because I'm in Weight Watchers, but I enjoy healthy eating. Some of the recipes sound interesting enough, but aren't ""everyday"" fare. There are a lot of recipes that require one to live in a good-sized city to have access to the ingredients (oysters, lobster, arborio rice, wild mushrooms, different cheeses, semolina flour, creme fraiche, demi-glace sauce.) None of the recipes really seem kid-friendly, or low-fat versions of tried-and-true favorites. The dessert section doesn't have anything in it that hasn't already been covered by one of the other WW cookbooks. I greatly prefer Simply the Best and The Best of WW Magazine Cookbook to this one."
2,Weight Watcher's Every Day Cooking,The recipes look good but too elegant for my every day cooking. I haven't used any of the recipes yet.
1,Don't Waste Your Money,I own many Weight Watchers cookbooks and this one is the worst I have seen. It calls for unusual ingredients and I don't consider it for everyday cooking at all. This one is strictly for gourmets and cooking school students. The other WW cookbooks are much more useful. I am sorry I wasted my money.
2,Too Glitzy,I found very few recipes in this book that I would actually fix. I don't have the time nor the family to truly appreciate this gourmet cook book. And the meals aren't low enough in points to be worth the effort...
2,I woke up looking like a coal miner!!,"Had been using Top Coverage but this has become impossible to get!!This stuff comes off much easier, in fact ridiculously easy!! - put it on the night before, styled my hair hairsprayed into it place....went out.... so far so good....but when I woke up the next morning there was a grey/black coating all over my faceI have thinning hair so didnt use much of the productI would not buy again unless I was absolutely desperate - Top Coverage is a million times better."
1,Panasonic Rip Off,"There's a reason why everywhere you look on the net for this 'cleaning kit' there is no picture. What you get is ten (10) 2-inch square, separately packaged isopropyl alcohol pads. My first clue should have been when it says 'No Returns'. They call them 'cleaning' sheets. What a rip-off!!!! I always put Panasonic in the upper tier; until now."
1,misrepresentation,This is a rip-off. I am surprised that amazon would be associated with such a gross misrepresentation. It is nothing more than a partial page of someone's notes from listening to some comments from Thatcher. Don't fall for it.
3,Mixed Messages,"The synopsis of the book both on the back cover and at the top on here pretty much covers the plot. And that's about it as regards the story.I get the impression that this was written more as an attempted exposure of the CIA's methods and a personal dig at the psychiatric profession rather than as a novel. The problem is, this is a work of fiction, and much like other subjects covered in books of fiction which are based on or around real situations, when a person comes across them in this context, it stays within this context, i.e. people reading this wont realise ultrasound and microwaves are used in modern mind control every day, simply because having read it in a novel it becomes ""the stuff of novels""."
3,3 1/2 stars,"See summary above.Though the whole storyline seemed quite implausible (e.g. the expenditure and time, as well as the blatant presence of the CIA, required to 'recruit' Scott Russell), it was quite entertaining. As another reviewer hinted at, once you realize that it's not realistic you'll enjoy the story more.I feel the story itself had a lot of potential, but the authors writing style just didn't quite get it.I will probably read the follow up novel just to see what happens to Scott and Laura and to see if there is a change in the writing."
1,Boring could've been better,I like this game only when i have nothing else to do but play this game. But like after 30 minutes it gets boring just driving a big truck selling and buying stuff its like come on it's just so not fun after 30 minutes to keep it simple don't buy this game it's not worth it
1,"Good Game,but complete BS compared to Big Rigs!","At first, I thought this was an okay game. But then I played Big Rigs: Over the Road Racing! It is my favorite game in the world! It gives me confidence by letting me win every time! It says, ""You're Winner"", which helps me with my grammar. The trucks are so hottttt! I love Big Rigs!"
4,Small but fun for a 6-year-old,"I was surprised at how small this was when we put it together (but it IS a ""mini""), but that's not necessarily a bad thing (except that it is very pricey to be so small). Many of the larger Star Wars Legos sets we've bought do not hold together well, but this one does, because of its small size. Plus, since it is smaller, a kid can actually play with it, unlike the larger ones which seem to be best left on the shelf. It also came with parts to a Y-wing fighter that you can complete if you buy the other three Minis (which I think is why it is more expensive than comparable size Lego sets). If you can get this with free shipping it is worth it."
4,Sharing works fine when connected to Windows 2000,"I saw this printer in my local PC World store, and I read all the reviews I could find before buying it. The price is amazing for a duplex laser printer, and I am very happy with my choice.It works absolutely fine on my LAN. I have it connected to a Windows 2000 server and had absolutely no problems printing from client machines. I have to point out that I did not use the drivers on the supplied CD, but the latest ones downloaded from the Panasonic web site (after reading tips about this on other review pages).Print quality is fine, so long as you don't use the Toner Save option. I use the printer for printing large documents where the duplex facility together with reducing multiple pages to a sheet can save a lot of toner and paper.If I need photo quality colour , I have a dedicated Epson Photo ink-jet printer. When I want good quality grayscale in large quantities, I use the KX-P7100."
1,"No, these people aren't crazy","It is garbage. It does jam. The ""4 pages and jam, 4 pages and jam...."" is about what we get on ours as well. If yours doesn't jam, then thank your deity that you got a fluke. If you count the amount of time spent opening it up, removing the paper jams, and restarting the print job, then it prints almost as fast as the HP LaserJet 4MP that it was purchased to replace, with 1000 times the hassle. We haven't had any sharing problems under W2K Pro, but who the heck wants to use it? I agree that this is a zero-star product."
1,Awful printer that jams constantly. I hate it!,This printer is a piece of junk. I cannot even use it because it jams all the time. It does help if you turn the printer off between print jobs - I have no idea why. I will never buy another Panasonic product. What a waste of money. My old NEC printer did not jam as much in 5 years as this printer did during the first week of operation. STAY WAY FROM THIS MODEL UNLESS YOU WANT A HEADACHE.
1,Continually jams,"It seems to make no difference what quality paper I buy for this printer, it just seems to misfeed or jam all the time.Stay well clear. It has to be the most disappointing Panasonic product I have ever bought, not to mention the most frustrating."
1,Sharing DOES NOT WORK!!!,"I am really dissatisfied with the purchase of this printer. Sharing does NOT work and that is exactly what we needed it for. What is the use of having a duplexing printer if you are using it for ONE single user?? Usually duplexing is a feature needed most when you are working with a network.This printer also does not like to work with print servers, making it completely useless."
2,Printer always jams,"This printer is ALWAYS jamming on me. I got it for the full duplex, but even just normal printing it jams. I have days where it doesn't jam at all, then days where it jams on nearly every print. I would most definitely NOT recommend this printer to others."
3,Reply to wtb56,"I have or had the same problem; It Will print 4 or 5 pages then jam. I sent it twice to Panasonic and every time they say we found no problem with it.A week ago I thought may be it jam because I leave it on all time, I started to switch it off every time I finish printing. Since a week I have no problem, SO FAR! Well, I dont like to be obliged to switch it off many times a day, but it is far better than clearing the jam every time.Hope this helps you."
1,Can NOT be Networked/Shared,"I got one of these. The install process was a little rocky, but I got it going after several reboots. This printer actually works fairly well for a single PC user, except for repeated envelope jams. If you work alone and don't use envelopes - its very nice.The printer performs absolutely unpredictably when shared on a Windows XP Lan. I contacted Panasonic tech support. They say it can NOT be used as a shared printer! I asked and they said they have no plans to fix this bug.15 ppm with duplex is great! But for a single user???I would return it ... if I could...!!"
1,"Great features & price, but -- jams make it a poor buy","Well, what can I say that hasn't already been said here, fifty times? On paper it is a great printer at this price point. In practice the paper jams make it nearly intolerable.What a shame."
1,The worst printer I have seen in 15 years,"Will print 4 pages then jam. Called Panasonic and I am told by two tech reps that this is about average for this printer. When I asked what my options were he said clear the jams and live with it or return.I give this printer, panasonic and anyone who sells this printer a big thumbs down. How can you manufacture much less sell something like this and go to sleep at night is beyond me."
2,"Unconvincing, and, worst of all, boring","A thought-provoking subject presented with none of the sense of wonder and awe it deserves. In the hands of a Gribbin, Asimov or Davies this subject - and the authors' conclusions - could have been fascinating. Here, it is so dryly treated that making it through the book is hard work. No fun here."
1,Disappointment,"I am interested in the topic but I was quite disappointed by the book. The main question: is there an arrow of time on a fundamental level is not properly discussed and the authors just repeat: ""there has to be"" without giving any convincing arguments. The book is badly written and does not argue clearly. No comparison with ""Schroedinger's cat"""
5,Londonistan,"A most inciteful reading of events to come which will change the culture of many countries, not just England who welcomed all outsiders and now are at their mercy, especially through the court systems.Scary."
4,An Indictment filled with selected facts without context,"Ms. Phillips' work is an erudite (hence the ""4"" rating) indictment of the lack of British response to the ""threat"" of growing Muslim influence in Great Britain (and the West in general).Her book, however, fails to provide the historical context of this movement and lapses into near-xenophobic ranting.IF you believe in her premise (the end of the world as we know it is upon us), your blood pressure will rise. You can add your voice to the chorus.IF you are an ardent supporter of Islam (our due place in the world needs to be recognized), your blood pressure will rise. You can add your voice to the contra-singers.IF you were looking for knowledge, the historical context, a reasoned assessment of the latest cultural influence in Great Britain, you will be disappointed: Londonistan gives you nothing to sing about."
4,A Frightening Assessment,"Melanie Phillips has written an excellent, well researched and courages expose of the degree to which Islamic Fundamentalism has influenced the way Britain is Governed, & the degree to which it has affected the political parties,the judiciary & the police."
5,Londonistan: A Book of Truth and Uncommon Courage,"Ms. Phillips has written a frightening non-fiction treatise that is right up there with Jared Diamond's ""Collapse."" Thanks to its lucidity, it is a rather quick read. Her writing is exquisite. But the content, ah, the content is indeed disturbing. No external enemy will ever destroy Western Civilization, its culture or its values. No, the West, if it is to be destroyed--will be destroyed from within, as it loses its will to resist and defend itself. It is at that point that we will simply surrender--not to the barbarians outside the gate, but to those inside it."
5,ALARMING FACTS ABOUT THE WAR WITH ISLAM!,iF ANYONE STILL DOUBTS WE ARE AT WAR WITH ISLAM OVER WHICH CIVILIZATION WILL RULE SUPREME...ISLAM OR WESTERN CIVILIZATION THEN THIS BOOK WILL CHANGE MINDS. THESE INCIDENTS AND DELIBERATE WIMPING OUT OF A WESTERN GOVERNMENT (IN THIS CASE THE BRITISH) ARE OCCURING THROUGHOUT WESTERN EUROPE AND SHOWS HOW IT IS ALL A PLAN. AN EYE OPENING BOOK. EVERY ADULT SHOULD READ THIS EXTREMELY WELL RESEARCHED BOOK. HER RESEARCH PROVES THERE ARE MANY WESTERN POLITICIANS IN LEAGUE WITH THE ISLAMICS. FOR WHATEVER REASON IS UP TO THE READER TO DECIDE.
1,Not recommended,"The author has taken an interesting subject and a large number of facinating, well-researched facts and managed to turn out the most boring, tediously written book on the subject that I have read so far. Think of your worst college history professor, droning on and on in that ""Ferris Bueller teacher"" voice until you want to jump out of your skin and you will have a good idea of the tone of this book. Maybe I'm picky about readability since I've been an editor for 20 years but I would recommend ""While Europe Slept"" or ""America Alone"" instead. However, if you've read all the other books, AND you are a glutton for punishment, this does provide a lot of information that could be interesting in the hands of a more talented writer."
1,TOO MUCH PROPAGANDA,I stopped reading this book in the middle because it becomes just another piece of pro-Israel propaganda.
4,The Dangers of Appeasement,"Melanie Phillips explains how British values of freedom and tolerance are being used against the people of Great Britain by Islamic fundamentalists who want to turn the country into a Caliphate. Her style is clear and her message is powerful. She blames political correctness for many of the woes of the West who bend over backwards to appease the Muslims. There is a home-grown enemy population within Great Britain who enjoy the social services, free education and free medical care, but who take every opportunity to undermine the nation which has sheltered them. According to Phillips, the government has been slow in dealing with the problem of homegrown terrorism. What should be done about it? Read ""Londonistan"" and be enlightened. The book is an eye-opener."
4,Megan's Review,"Oh my God... I loved this Book, it was great and I couldn't put it down, I'm only 12 years of age, but that book was great. Neverending action, and great descriptions. I LOVED IT!!! I can't belive that I like it that much. But it wouldn't be good for immature children, this isn't really a book for kids, but I loved it and I would read another book by those athours. (...)"
5,"reasonably priced , good quality multivitamin","i have been using Nature Made products for quite a few years now. i have also tried many other brands, some inexpensive, and some that are very expensive. the nature made multi-vitamin is a good quality, reasonably priced vitamin. i also notice a difference when i change brands, and then change back to nature made. you can tell it works. you won't go wrong with this one :)"
3,its... ok,does not look like the picture. a lil bit darker and it barely lights up. no instructions and the screws to hold it to the stick dnt stay in. after like a day of shifting they will wiggle lose and the knob will start to wiggle around which gets annoying. try finding something at ur local car places or something that matches your car right. i have a celica-gts 2000 but it looks good
1,"Misleading photo, no instructions","Although the delivery on this was exceptionally prompt, the item was not as I expected. I'd searched for a PINK LED shift knob, and this item came up. It isn't pink, it's RED. The teeny tiny screws inside were loose and I mistook them for debris, so they went in the trash when I opened the pkg. No instructions came with it either so I guess I'll be winging the install. Amazon has the same item so the listing pics will either be changed, as seller requested, or left as is, with the pink photo appearing as the main photo. Seller did not offer refund, but was very helpful trying to figure out why there were no instructions or why this was not pink."
2,Quirky device,"The device is stylish and compact. It utilizes a version of Windows for mobile devices that does many things Windows does including crashing, losing data, locking up, etc. That is the problem; good functionality but quirky and unreliable. My phone will spontaneously reject calls without warning, dial people on the contact list spontaneously while sitting on my desk, fail to end calls when the ""end"" button is pressed causing incurring charges, spontaneously go to mute in the middle of a conversation..."
2,Not the original charted hits......,"I have this CD and these are not the original charted hits and sound. I am disappointed with it. If you, too, like the original sound, don't purchase this one. I purchased this CD from a record club thru the mail and was led to believe these were the original CHARTED hits. They are not. It's the original artist, the original songs, but not the original charted versions of them!"
3,re-recordings a plenty,"this 10 song collection would be great had they been the original versions. the reason i say this isn't because i HATE remakes and re-recordings. it's because of the impact these particular songs had on the music industry and how a re-recording fails to capture the ""sound"" of the original even though the songs and artist are the same. in my opinion anyway that's why i prefer original versions but if they've become out of print and hard to find, re-recordings aren't that bad as a substitution until the real things come along. however, Kenny's original versions are STILL available {check out ""20 Greatest Hits"" on Liberty} so like the other reviewer said, this is only for completists who want to have nearly everything on Kenny that's out there."
5,Highspeedboom,"This Oscar Schmidt Requinto is one of the most beautiful guitars I have seen, and now own. The workmanship, and finish is really good for the price. It is 35"" long, 13"" wide, 18 frets, It has Vinci classic acoustic guitar Strings, the larger 3 of 6 strings are Silver plated the others are clear Nylon.Sound is very good, was already close to tuned when I took it out of the box and I played for 4 hours and it is still in good tune. does not have any flaws in workmanship that I can tell, except it does not have shoulder strap hooks installed, But the size is right to keep it up with your arm as you play standing.It came with a very good soft gig bag that has a zipper pouch on the outside top. Really is a beautiful Cutaway Guitar Made in China, by Washburn, but high quality."
5,Fantastic!,"So much better than the substandard variety/quality found in your SuperMarket. They always say to to the source, and Portugal is sure it! Wonderful spicy olive oil with plump firm fresh looking sardines in the can-great with Triscuit crackers-and healthy!"
4,Great show!,The only thing I didn't care for with this DVD set was words are bleeped out and that wasn't mentioned in the description.
4,i love the show but...,"i love this show, it's so funny and totally really. But this dvd is a bit of a disappoint. Some of the cuss words are bleeped out still and there isn't subtitles, so it's a little annoying."
1,Can't get it on my ipad!!,"Have tried repeatedly to download to my ipad, will not work. At this point it was a waste of my money."
5,Very Funny,Did not think I would like this show but I found it at a really good price so I went ahead and got it. Very funny. Arrived at perfect timing.
5,Great!,This DVD shipped extremely fast and arrived at my doorstep even before it was supposed to ship. It came packaged safely and it ran like a charm. No complaints.
3,Barely 3 stars,"Going for Juno but failing, Awkward is exactly that...AWKWARD to the extreme. Everyone thinks the main character tried to kill herself when really she just slipped in her bathroom and only nearly died of the embarrassment of having to walk around with a neck brace and an arm cast and being thought to have tried to kill herself. She's in love with a big, awful dork who she loses her virginity to in a utility closet practically before we've even figured out her name. So, far...just plain uncomfortable and kinda vulgar. Though, who could expect less than the latter from MTV?"
1,AWKWARD,I LOVE THE SHOW BUT I BLOODY HATE CENSORSHIP WITH A PASSION. I WAS DISGUSTED TO DISCOVER ALL SWEARING AND THE SHOWING OF THE MIDDLE FINGER WAS BLOCKED. SHAME ON THE COMPANY RESPONSIBLE FOR RUINING THIS GREAT SHOW. AMAZON SHOULD DEMAND THE FOLLOWING SEASONS ARE UNCUT ON DVD AS THIS WILL ENSURE BIGGER SALES AND BETTER ENJOYMENT FOR US MUGS WHO DESERVE MUCH BETTER THAN THIS. PULL YOUR BLOODY HEADS IN AND SHOW US SOME RESPECT IN FUTURE BY NOT TREATING US LIKE KIDS.
1,Not received,I cant rate this product as I still havent received it!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Would be nice if someone tracked it and found why we havent received it yet. It was meant for a birthday gift and now will have to be a christmas gift!
1,Dvd player wouldnt load disc 1,The discs wouldn't load in the dvd player to watch them. I sent product back and am now waiting for the replacement dvds
3,"5-Star Show, 2-Star Delivery","This is a great show. It reminds me of My So Called Life, and is absolutely hilarious. However, Amazon gets the show really late. They're streaming on MTV way before they're made available for subscribers/purchasers.So, I'm not entirely sure it's worth the purchase. Unless you've got some huge desire to own the episodes, you might as well save your money and stream it."
5,AWKWARD,I is a realy good show for teens but I just the way jenna gets in all these situations.I just wish they would stop using OMG and othrs aginst the Lord . I cant wait for the 3rd seasonto come out.I realy would like to meet the castsomeday.
5,Awkward,"Awkward is so funny, I always watch it. Can't wait for season 2 to be over so I can get that DVD too! Love this show!"
1,Lousy service,I ordered the book more than one month ago. Amazon said it should have been delivered more than ten days ago.
1,An Embarrassment,"When you review the list of outstanding actors, you think, ""This has got to be, if not great, at least a good movie."" Not so! Don't be fooled. This thing has no story--it's just a series of compartmentalized scenes edited together, apparently by committee. The technical effects, depicting the RAF in action, were adequate for that day, but this could not possible redeem an otherwise lost cause. The real story of ""The Battle of Britain"" deserves much better than this."
3,Ello,"My friend has Ello, and I've noticed a few things about it.First of all, what girl wants to play with the Ello people? They're ugly little robot-looking things. Sure, it's cool that you can build and design them, but still. My friend plays with her Polly Pockets on the houses instead.Second, the pieces are rather hard to stick together. One time when my friend and I played, her house kept falling apart and she had to repeatedly re-attach the pieces, only for them to come apart again.Finally, my over-all opinion is, if I want a house for my toys, I'm going to buy a Polly Pocket house, or build one out of sturdy blocks, not flimsy plastic Ello pieces. I don't have any desire to own Ello."
3,Leica Lens book,"A book where you see that a lot of effort and time has been put in. But I was a bit suprized when I looked first in it, I could not see any sample pictures of the Lenses. At least the most recent and most sold lenses should have them. No comments where be added on the lenses by the autor. In generell I find it personal very pur of information."
5,works great and has long range in open rooms,I purchased this for our local church for power point presentations at different times and this thing has really performed well. It seems to have at least 100' range or maybe a little better in open rooms.
5,Great soundtrack and great album,"Wonderful album; DVD also available on Amazon is even better. So many great parts it's hard to know where to start. How about Elton Medeiros playing the 'caixa de fosforos' (matchbox), a one-man percussion session ? Carinhoso, for sure; but also the work with Velha Guarda de Portela is genuine and profound. The voices may go as they get older, but the sense of timing just gets better. Great old sambistas may only be able to suggest the outlines of the melody, but the musicality is 10000% there . ."
5,How Reading Changed My Life,"How Reading Changed My LifeThis book details Anna Quindlen's lifelong love of books and reading. She describes growing up with books around her, raising her children with books around them, censorship, recommendations and other tidbits that book lovers will enjoy. Readers will get Anna's fascination with reading, how much of a part of her life it is, and her desire to share its meaning with other readers. This book is a quick read, but has a lot of depth. I enjoyed her writing style--down to earth, personal and interesting. I recommend this read.http://melissasbookpicks.blogspot.com/"
2,How Reading Changed Myt Life,"Not edition as shown, unappealing library edition. Less appealing to read, zip resale value. Would not have ordered this book had these facts been disclosed."
1,So Who cares?,I felt she could have summed the essay up in a few points on a page. It was boring as she went on and on about what she has read in her life. I just didn't care. It was the longest 80 pages I ever read. Was glad when it ended.
2,"Sorry, wrong author","I think my review inadvertently used the wrong author's name. Sorry, it was Ms. Quindlan"
5,She Understands Your Need to Read,"This book is a wonderful way for readers to understand themselves, if they don't already. Quindlen shows that we're NOT weird because we read, we're NOT escapists who can't handle the real world, and we're NOT anti-social. We're just in love with words and the power of stories. In only 84 pages, Quindlen tackles the reasons why we read, reading and technology, why classics should not be crammed down our kids' throats, and much more. Her Top Ten lists alone are worth the price of the book. As great as this book is for readers, it makes an even better gift for friends and family members who DON'T understand our need to read. A must read, a must-have."
4,Quindlen Understands.,"While this book can at times be a bit defensive, Quindlen has a right to be. Readers, she points out, have been belittled, called stuck up, and tracked down in police states. We're almost an endangered species. At times, I celebrated with her the joys of discovering a book sure to become a lifelong friend; at other moments, I found myself sniffling and holding back tears at encounters with people who do not, and never will, understand and so must belittle those of us who read.At some points, the memoir crawls, but there isn't any part of it that isn't vital to Quindlen's overall message. This, along with Fadiman's ""Ex Libris,"" is book I lend out with the knowledge that the borrower will insist in keeping it."
5,"Amazingly good deal for a duplex, network printer","This product is well designed right down to the packaging. Even the diagrams printed on the box are excellent. At $307, this was by far the cheapest duplex, network printer I could find. Mine arrived with one loose roller that I slid back into place when I noticed it as I was thoroughly going over it before plugging it in. The toner and drum kit had been opened and resealed, probably refurbs or refills. It has an http server as well as a telnet server. The drivers allow putting 1, 2, and 4 pages per sheet. At 37 pages printed lifetime everything still seems too good to be true."
5,molly's advise reveiw,If you buy this for your child then you are making the right decision because this toy will tech your child how gravity works. This toy will also last along time and it will stay in contact. It will stay in contact for awhile because the lego don't break but it might fall apart.
2,"Very nice, but redundant","Although this is a very nice book, with lots of information and great pictures, it is simply a partial reprint of Slater's earlier book ""The Complete Book of Heraldry"". For anyone with a serious interest in heraldry, the Compete Book is a much better book and a much better deal."
2,Christian means love not hate ...,"I thought I would like this book, as I have always liked Guideposts & Norman Vincent Peale for their practical, positive and tolerant teachings. But when I did pick up this book to read it, I saw a heading on homosexuality. Seeing that there was no room for understanding under that heading, I couldn't even finish the book.Not that the book doesn't have things to offer. Many excellent authors contribute. You'll find Robert Schuller, Madeleine L'Engle, Chuck Colson, C.S. Lewis and others.I just don't have the kind of Christianity that sees others with anything other than love and acceptance."
2,Not as advertised,"The product is very nice, but did not come with a display case as advertised. The manufacturer confirmed that this was a mistake by Amazon. Also, the product was damaged slightly upon arrival; however, I was able to fix it with a little glue. No big deal."
2,BUYER BEWARE!!!!,"The display case is not included as described on this page. It cost an additional $51.05 including shipping. Now I finally have the case to protect the model. This is a really nice piece for my fan cave, too bad the experience was ruined with such a lie!! Just like shoes are sold in pairs, the picture clearly shows the item in the nice case. Buyer beware!!!! It's a sham, designed to just take your money."
3,First Born is a disappointment,"I had eagerly awaited the arrival of First Born. It started out very well. It answered some of the questions I had about the treatment of Jason when he was kidnapped by the drug lords. After that the book goes down hill. He turns into Mr. Nice guy by just being around the heroine Annie. Then he gets wounded. He loses his memory. It seems to be a rewrite of Morgan's story of amnesia. Ms. McKenna makes a gigantic error in time and personel when puts Jason's great grandparents in World War II. In Dawn of Valor, Chase and Rachel Trayhern are in Korea as a pilot and a MASH nurse. Since they are Jason's grandparents, there is no way that this is possible. That is an error that ruined my appreciation of the book. I am a faithful reader. I hope that her next book is better, or that she gets an editor that is more familiar with previous works."
2,Military? stay away,"Truthfully, I couldn't get past the first third of the book. The mistakes McKenna makes with regards to the military are horrible. One reviewer already mentioned that she got the ranks wrong, but it goes way beyond there. There's a ton of mistakes with regards to uniforms, and decorum, even things as basic as the main character not having her hair up off her collar. I kept trying to get past it, and just when I thought I could get back into the swing of the story, up would pop another mistake. Maybe some someone who only read military themed books because they're exciting could get past it. But I'm ex-Army myself and every five pages I wanted to knock my head against the wall. I would have actually given it One Star, but I gave Ms. McKenna the benefit of the doubt and decided on two, since I couldn't get past the glaring errors into the actual plot of the book. For all I know, that might be okay. I just didn't make it there."
4,"I Don't Remember, I Don't Recall","It's pretty amazing to read this book of the Ramseys' police interviews and see how much Patsy Ramsey cannot recall or remember. Then read the Ramsey's book ""Death of Innocence"" where tiny little details are spelled out.This book is pretty incriminating. If one was not sure of the Ramseys guilt before reading this book, (like me), reading it may surely put you over the fence.It's sickening how hypocritical these people were-- when comparing this to their book. And how little they helped the police. No wonder the crime is unsolved."
3,"Lots of Info, No New Evidence","After reading this superbly written book, I am still no closer to MY own conclusion. Excellent word by word account from the investigators & the Ramseys, but still leaves a lot of unanswered questions. I do not like, however, how Mrs. Ramsey is blamed at the end of the book due to her handwriting analysis."
4,I like this one!,"I dont know why but all the other sh.. that Short has put out on ShortRecords has been weak except Nationwide Volume I. His two albums are tight especially Cant Stay Away. But this album is sweet. Track 16 with the Up All Nite Crew is sweet. I think that alum will be dope. Check this album out. If you have not heard all the stuff on Shortrecords, if it doesnt say Nationwide dont get it unless you are a die hard Too $hort Fan."
3,A decent compilation from Short Records,"A decent compilation from Short Records featuring new material from a terrific line-up of rappers, including lesser known bay area rapper Slink Capone. This is the follow up toNationwide: Independence Day. Here is a more detailed track listing:1. I'll Take Your Hoe - The Up All Nite Crew2. Cigarette - UGK/Eightball/Too $hort3. Diamonds - Slink Capone4. Can't Stop - Dolla Will [of T.W.D.Y.]/Too $hort5. Shoulda Had Your Thugs6. Ride & Roll - Layzie Bone/Mo' Thugs7. You Nasty (remix) - Too $hort (original version released onYou Nasty)8. Let My Nuts Go - Too $hort9. Just One - Too $hort/China10. Shake Dem Haters - Quint Black11. Where U at?

Head - The Up All Nite Crew17. Strike Three - Badwayz"
4,A wild ride,"I took this book on vacation. Big mistake. This is not a vacation or beach book. It was a very quick read and had me reeling for several days. It took me three days to decide whether or not I liked it and would recommend it. I would, but the readers need to be mentally prepared. His most Stephen King-like book that I've read so far. So many levels of horror here. So many."
2,Terribly disturbing,"Is it possible to remain sane in an insane world? O'Nan answers this question with no. Jacob reverts to appalling habits, both during the diptheria outbreak and during the war, in an attempt to appear in control. O'Nan gives the readers a horrifying portrayal of human nature."
5,"Troubling, harrowing, and fascinating all at once.","I found the troubling aspect of this novel was that these events probably did occur in many rural towns because of ignorance and lack of medecine to combat the horror of diptheria. The author writes with a laser precision and really makes you feel you are *there*. It is good, it is creepy, but don't read it if you feel clinically depressed."
5,Second Person That Reads Well...,"This novel through me for a loop at first. I have never read a novel written in the second-person. That actually drew me in, just trying to get use to that style. This novel is a true classic and does a great job of being very descriptive while keeping the story flowing.This is a novel about testing the strength of man's character and integrity under trying circumstances. The main character is the sheriff, the preacher, and the coroner. Three jobs that give one a unique look at all different sides of events and life itself. It accurately portrays the human struggle during our most desperate times. Very good read. I highly recommend any student of English give it a go; you'll (a little second person pun) be glad you did!"
2,grrrrrrrr...annoying,"I felt this book was writtern in a detached manner. Every time you felt you wanted to be part of the narrative it sort of warped you around. There was no emotional ties with the main characters. In fact all you wanted was for everyone to die and the book to end! If you feel you must read this book, take it out of the library and do yourself a favor!"
3,"confusing, frustrating and misleading","I read Emily, Alone and wanted to read more from this author. But this novel was very disappointing. Yes, it is about human behavior, but it was not what I expected. The central character was an emotionally disturbed war veteran traumatized by his war experience. But that makes no excuse for the frustration as the reader knows the central character is spreading the disease due to his refusal to follow doctors orders. THEN the author attributes deaths of animals to diptheria, which is not possible. Much of the shock effect is from animal deaths yet the reader knows this is not possible. There is just too much here that is not good reading...sorry but I can't recommend this book."
2,"Oh, please","After everything O'Nan's done for us, this is easily his most insincere. I never believed the ethical battles, I never bought the slight insanity and I certainly couldn't figure the point. Darkness for darkness' sake is, well, just dark. It's as if Stewart was just looking for a new setting to ply his trade, rather than flexing his literary muscles, as he has in the past. I don't buy it."
3,"alright, but definitely overrated","I would consider myself a somewhat sophisticated reader, and often find that choosing a book worthy of reading (and investing my time) with the help of internet reviews and editorial reviews takes some time.However, I feel that A Prayer for the Dying is not quite the masterpiece that the customer reviews seem to indicate. O'Nan uses a unique plot and setting to make the book interesting, but if other writers wrote a book of this short length (195 SMALL Pages) or longer, they could surely do better in the area of character development, and concentrate less on body counts. The setting for the book and the story are interesting, but I feel that there was little character development, even of the main character, other than some simplistic moral arguments. Even his grief over his wife's death seemed too subdued."
2,Not impressed,"I finished it because a friend recommended it, but had she not, I would have quit after page 20. I wasn't interested in the story or writing. I didn't find the story grotesque; I've read a lot worse dealing with the various topics in this book, but I just didn't find the protagonist very interesting. He went a bit nutty at the end and it is understandable given the situation. We learn about why he had to stick so tenaciously to his religious beliefs, to redeem himself. His actions didn't seem out of line, either during the war or during the plague, given his dire predicament and previous behaviors and experiences. I know this is a great example of a book written in second person, and perhaps for that it is worth reading. I wouldn't pick it up for enjoyment or leisure."
1,"Right Idea, Wrong Format","I found O'Nan's book a very difficult read. Writing in the 2nd Person format made the book hard to follow and boring. O'Nan had a good story plot, but should have used the 1st or 3rd Person Format to make the book more enjoyable and exciting read. The plot had the potential to be a page-turner. So much more could have been done with the story. This is the first book of O'nan's that I have read. If this book is considered his best, then I will not be reading any of his others."
2,Prayer for the Dying,"Just a strange book----but so strange and somehow so real, I could not put it down, nor skip over passages, as I do with some books I'm bored with. I cannot really recommend this book unless the reader is into psychic horror, and likes that sort of thing. I was glad I was done with it and yet I have one more book by this author, that no doubt I will read one day."
5,A heartbreaking novel from Stewart O'Nan,"A Prayer for the Dying is a novel told in second person, and this engaging form is odd but effective. Through the eyes of the narrator, the reader sees a small concern become a hysteria and the nature of the beast is revealed. A thoroughly disturbing novel, the language is often poetic and thoughtful. O'Nan is a pleasure to read; this is the best thing he has done since Snow Angels. One of the finest writers today."
5,Masterful writing encompasses an overwhelming plot...,"O'Nan is an unheralded artist of the highest quality, and his lastest offering is frightfully captivating. Writing entirely in the 2nd person, O'Nan elicits, no forces, both emotional and visceral reader involvement/reaction in this historical fiction. O'Nan demonstrates his art through the heart of the town undertaker/constable/preacher in the midst of a post Civil War Diptheria epidemic. O'Nan can always get inside the head of his characters, and this time, thanks to the 2nd person, the character is YOU.A shortish novel, Prayer can't be missed. Mesmerized and totally impressed, I may rank A Prayer For the Dying as the best peice of writing I have EVER read. Don't miss Prayer, and don't miss O'Nan while he's still ours...and don't pre-read any reviews that give away the plot"
1,The book that could have been,"First, you should understand that literally half this book is taken up by the text of RFC's that you can already get on the Internet. The rest is taken up by brief introductions to tools such as nmap and Ethereal that are too brief to be really useful. The book shows some examples of iptables but does not explain what is really going on. Skip this one, folks."
2,Not very complete (or accurate) after all,"I was very recently diagnosed with type 1 diabetes and need accurate information on grams of carbohydrates to determine my insulin use. I had to send this book back - the nutritional information was incorrect for the couple of recipes I looked at (For example, one recipe stated it had over 100 grams of carbs. I couldn't tell if it was missing a decimal or what the problem was. Even if that was the carbs per recipe rather than per serving, when you divided it by the # of servings it still ended up being more carbs than most diabetics should eat at a meal).In addition, the majority of the recipes were for desserts - which doesn't make a complete meal in my diet!"
2,Totaly Unrealistic,"The recipes are overly elaborate, some ingredients uanaviable. Would not have bought this book if I had seen it first."
3,"Great price, great quality","I felt this was a great bargain. However, the one and only downfall of this product was that it was definitely used in a smoking household. The book did smell of cigarette smoke. Otherwise, I feel the book was a great deal with equally great quality. Thanks, Amazon!"
5,Always the best deodorants ;-),"Whenever I come to the States for vacation, I stock up on Secret deodorants because I can't get these back home. I've always found that they make the best fragrances, but that the fragrance lasts all day and the product does its job.If you buy their sticks, there is a chance of white marks on clothing - but I've found that in any brand. I like their gels, because this puts an end to white marks. The smell of this - Brazillian Cherry - is so nice and different to any other deod I've used. I can smell it still at 5pm when I'm ready to leave work and that is very reassuring.If you are wanting a great deodorant with fantastic staying power and unique fragrances, then I highly highly recommend this one and other gel ranges of Secret. It's one of the best I've ever used."
3,Typical Peterson,Typical of all the Peterson guides. This one has all the information one normally needs. It also is arranged in sometimes frustrating sections which require one to go to several sections for a complete profile of the subject matter. I simply do not want to spend the time going back and forth in the book when I simply want basic information on one insect.
1,Worthless,"The problem with buying online is that you can't see the item before you buy it. You can only go by the very little bit amazon allows you to view. In the case of this pamphlet, there isn't much to see at all. Poor, childishly sketched pictures, very few butterflies or moths included. I regret purchasing it."
2,A Bit too brief,"I bought this when my daughter started expressing interest in butterflies. The pictures are ok. There is so little information. It is rather dull. Not sure if there is anything better out there, but this book is rather uninspiring."
4,Action packed,"I didn't know what to get my religion class kids for Christmas until I read this. It's action packed Christian fiction. Think Indiana Jones. The reason I can't give it 5 stars is because it's outdated in places - the bad guys are Russians from the Cold War. All the same, I think it's a great book for reluctant readers."
5,This book rules!,"I am a huge Indiana Jones fan and I saw this book in my schools library. It looked OK and I had already read the first three so I thought ""Why Not?"". I loved it. It is one of my favorite books."
2,FROM A PERETTI FAN!!!,"I have read almost all of his books---that said---this was, by far, the weakest,most far-tetched, absurd """"Cooper Kids""""book of the series. Aaaannnddd the whole---""""don't worry about it---GOD will takecare of it / me""""---is over-the-top in this one!!!Sorry---but---I'm still a Peretti fan!!!"
4,from Westminster John Knox,"Insightful and thought-provoking comments on Acts 1-12 parallel the author's own readable translation of the Bible text. Background information about the scriptures, helpful explanations about its meanings, and discussion of how it can be relevant to lives today are woven together seamlessly in the author's inviting style. This book includes a glossary."
4,Not a lot of depth,"I enjoyed the commentary, but did not find much depth. The lessons would probably work for a study group or Sunday school class."
2,"2 day delivery & Contents of 4656 head lamp conversion ""kit""","I ordered the pilot H4 4656 headlamp conversion kit on 9-30-09 and paid extra for 2 day delivery. I received the package on 10-5-09, not in 2 day's. In the package was a box containing 2 Pilot lens/reflector units and 2 rubber like seals, nothing else. Writing on the box stated it contained a ""kit"". This kit is to replace a sealed beam, light producing headlamp. Being a ""kit"", implies that it has the necessary parts to replace the sealed beam unit and produce light when energized. The ""kit"" did not have H4 bulbs or wire harness. The wire harness is necessary because the H4 bulb and the sealed beam have different location of the contact blades, ie; you can't just plug the vehicle wire harness onto the H4 bulb. There was no mention, by Amazon, at anytime, that H4 bulb's and wire harness were not included. I now have 2 pieces of glass and seal's, but, no light."
2,Cheap Lowgrade Plastic from China,"It is not obvious from the sales description, but these lightweight, plastic chinese lamp housings do NOT include bulbs. That is to say, lightbulbs are not included, not even correspondingly cheap low grade chinese bulbs.Which is probably okay, since the intended application is to use them with cheap chinese HID conversion bulbs.Rather than this product, I would recommend spending an extra couple dollars on the HELLA headlamp conversion housings, as the HELLA are a far better quality."
3,"Product itself is fine, but you MUST buy the sync adapter for it to work!!!","The product itself works just fine, just like every other cord I had tried, but what nobody tells you is that if you're getting this cord to be able to hook up your Zen to the TV to view your videos, you will need the sync adapter. You can't just plug this into your device and your tv. I wish I had known this when I bought it, because I had to wait yet another 4 days to be able to view the videos after it arrived. Save yourself the trouble and order them both together."
3,Not so good,"It dosen't work for all the tv, maybe for widescreen tv. Well, the movies and the picture look great, but the menu of the zen dosen't."
1,OK IT WORKS,It works. My original review was bad but then I figured it out. I just want to say it need better instructions. I had forgotten that I needed to use the connector. But not bad overall.
5,Handy For People who have alot of Media,If you wanna share videos or photos with a large group of people then this is handy especially if you keep alot of HQ movie and videos on your Zen. It should've been included. you can also hook the audio chord up to the back of my stereo ( if your able) and hook the vidoeo chords up to your tv that way you can get the sound out the speakers and see the screen on the T.V
5,impressive,HDTV output would be nice but on a regular TV it's great. Output depends on the quality of video you are showing. DVD rips usually look dead on or near DVD quality.
5,great book for the value,"When I first heard this Piano sonata the first thing that popped in my head was that I had to learn this genius piece of music, The second movement acually inspired me to re-learn the piano. The fingering suggestions are great, and everything is there so if you are looking for a cheap copy of this piano sonata, this is it."
4,Maggy's Child,This is not Robards' best but it was still an exciting read--and very hot! The chase scenes were riveting!
4,Maggy's Child,Purchased this book because I enjoy the author as a general rule. Good storyline but a bit too much sexual content.
2,Entertaining but...,"... highly predictable, to say the least. The story may sound familiar: damsel in distress, too good to be true good guy, psychotic bad guy. Guess how it ends! Need I say any more?"
2,This was supposed to be a contemporary?,"I had to keep telling myself that it was a contemporary story. I just wasn't buying that fact that a supposedly street smart girl, like Maggy, would let anyone, let alone Lyle do what he did to her. Smack her around, turn her child against him, let his brother in law do what he did. My gosh, Maggy wake up and smell the coffee!!! She should not have had to turn to Nick for saving. She should have been able to save herself . . . . 12 years before. She should have had more back bone given the childhood she endured. Nick, hhhmmm, he should have been able to locate her a long time before the 12 years had passed especially if he cared so much about her."
4,Maggy's Child,Just when you think you know what will happen-here comes another twist or turn! She has written better but this one still kept me awake at night until I finished!
2,Not my cup of tea,"I'm not sure, but I think it had something to do with Lyle's satan-like behavior that turned me off to this one. I liked the storyline, however, 'I'm pregnant and the real father doesn't find out for 15 years', but the atrocious and dreadful circumstances that Maggie endures just to protect the secret...and then finally reveals the truth in the end...is just not my idea of romance."
2,Stupid Silly Characters,"Again, Karen Robards has disappointed me. I used to be a fan but after the terrible ""Senator's Wife"" and now this, I'm going to avoid her. This book is so aggravating. I really can't muster sympathy for a woman who lets herself get physically tortured by a monster. She's a mother who should have been far more responsible. She's also a wimp when it comes to Nick, who just barges into her life and orders her around, almost like Lyle. And what was the deal about Nick blackmailing her with photographs from her past? You'd fall in love with a blackmailer? And Nick's character is a bland formless male being with no personality or charm. No, I'm sorry but again, Karen Robards has greated a romance story with truly odious lead characters."
3,Lacking Lyrics,"This group had a good sound, but reading the lyrics while listening to this album for the first time left me disappointed. Every song has the same theme: no one has suffered like me. Too much self-pity and selfishness. Even accepting that as being typical of this kind of music, the lyrics aren't even very intelligent... like bad poetry from a depressed high school student. However, if you're the type of person that can appreciate the music without paying too much attention to the lyrics, then you should be fine."
3,I really want to like this band...,"I do. Heather Thompson is a talented vocalist and has a very likeable sound, the band behind her are competant and the music is quite good but....I guess they're just a little too mainstream for my taste.They really shouldn't be hidden away in this little corner of amazon - it's very misleading. I highly recommend that you download a couple of songs and get a feel for the band before you buy this album. If you like them, great, go buy. If not...well, a couple of downloads is surely better than paying for the whole album.Look, if you're reading this review, do download a couple of tracks. They certainly are worth your time. Just not my taste, that's all."
3,Metal fans avoid at all costs!!!!!!!!!,"What the hell was a great label like nuclear blast thinking when they signed this band!? Other than the ocasionally guitar every ten minutes there is absolutly nothing metal about this band. While I've got nothing against females in metal, this girl may be the worst singer I've ever heard and should go join some pop band where we'd only have to hear her when the channel accidently gets turned to Mtv. Though I absolutly hate this album, I'll give it an average rating in the interest of fairness since I'm not the best person to judge pop albums, and that's exactly what this is. Metal fans interested in bands with female vocalists should check out Lacuna Coil, Alas, The Gathering,Epica, Nightwish, Brave, and Within Temptation and Rhea's Obsession because they are all a million times better than this."
1,Once upon a time. . .,I imagined my turds had more creativity than this band.Turns out I wasn't imagining.
5,A very dark heartfelt album,"I first heard of TTV when i heard their cover of Tori Amos' ""Cornflake Girl"" which rocked and was the only standout tune on the tribute cd.The Damage is a great cd in large part to Heather Thompson's raw yet amazing voice that wraps itself around your mind and makes you feel the emotions that flow from her. The lyrics are better than mainstream rock and pop and the guitars,drums, bass are top notch as well. I refuse to lump TTV as a ""goth"" band because every goth band i ever heard sucked in a psuedo-dark craptacular way. I can't really even pick a favorite song on this cd as they are all very good."
2,Goth `easy listening'?,"I'm not sure how to describe this band's sound. I can certainly hear the Goth genra in it but it's remarkably generic. There is nothing outstanding or original about it. All the way through the album I was waiting for it to get started, to really shine or give me something that I hadn't heard a thousand times before. It was all just so...bland. At times I could almost believe I'm listening to a Goth remixed Avril Lavigne album (*shudder*).Despite my dislike of the generic style of this band, I don't think the musicians untalented. In fact I can say that they seem to know their business and they play together well. The album is also well balanced. It's just so unremarkable it's painful. There is no excuse for this when they have the talent."
3,nothing to shout about,"Tapping the Vein's first CD is a decent effort, just nothing exceptional. None of the songs really stand out, and Heather's voice doesn't display much range (especially when compared to her European counterparts), coming off as a slightly rougher version of Cyndi Lauper. As for categorization, it is only marginally Goth or metal, though this is not a criticism."
4,great flag,FLAG LOOKS GREAT ONLY ONE PROBLEM IT WON'T LAST LONG I DON'T BELIEVE.I WISH IT WAS WEATHER PROOF
1,Very Poor Service,"Twice now I have tried to buy this sweater which was listed as in stock, twice my transaction went through and I received my email confirmation saying they received my order, and twice I had the order cancelled on me. Not really sure how people can run a business that way."
1,this company sucks,They listed it as a ladies.. and it is definatly meant for a teen.. They are completely unrelaible and will not pick up the product they misrepresented to me and expect me to pay back the shipping.. this company SUCKS.. and will not simply do a ups call tag to pick the item up.. Considering they said it was a ladies garment and it is not.. it is a slim misses product..If you have a girl who can wear this product it is definatly a great investment but I as a consumer would not purchase this from Old Glory bc it is NOT what they advertise. But if you were a girl.. or a young misses.. its awsome! BUT it is not what is advertised.
4,love it,excellent figure! but revoltech is the gold standard in my opinion. if your a fan of dougram or battletech this is a awsome product.articulation is second to none and the extra hands allow numeous poseing options
2,Hard to play in large groups,I bought this game (for $50) to use as a classroom tool and play with my drama classes. I found the game frustrating and boring for my students and even though it was recommended by a book I did not find it useful. I wish I hadn't spent the money!
2,A Bummer,"I bought one of these about 2 months ago when my old earpiece quit. I have to say it's pretty disappointing.The fit to the ear is too loose and not adjustable enough so it feels like a little fish flopping around if you're moving your head at all. And because it won't stay put against the ear, it's not loud enough. Well, in a quiet room it's OK, but the way I use it, at airports, in the car, at trade shows, etc., forget it.It also constantly loses the connection from my Treo 680.I really can't understand why companies come out with products like this - doesn't anyone market test them? I should have returned it but now it's too late. Just ordered a Jabra.. hope it works better!"
4,happy,"I was very resistant to having to use this device, however with the law changes in ontario it became necessary. I have beed really pleased so far. I find the ear piece to be very comfortable, and actually is really unobtrusive. THe sound is fine, although not quite as good as with my regular phone. But it exceded my expectations overall. No one has complained that they can't hear me. I am happy!"
1,Did not charge,"Before this headset, I had the H700 and was very happy with it for 2 years. I decided to buy another Motorola, this time without the flip boom. I received this in 3 days which I was very pleased about. I plugged it in and the light came on right away. It then flickered out a few seconds later. I called Motorola, not the seller on here, and they had me plug it into my car charger. Same result. Motorola sent a new one 4 days later and the same thing happened. Now I am waiting on shipping labels to return both headsets to Motorola. I am beginning to wonder if any maker makes a good bluetooth headset anymore. I have heard all kinds of complaints from friends of mine with all thier headsets. It is just hard to believe there are this many bad H670's."
1,Not a good product,"This product is no good. First unit I got didn't power on after charging. Called Motorola and they sent me a 2nd one. This, too did not turn on!! Unbelievable. I am demanding a replacement (and better model) from Motorola. Don't BUY!"
1,not pleased,"i bought this product from this site. then when i received it, it did not work. i had to call the original manufacturer to get it replaced. now i have to pay for a second one. not pleased."
1,Worst bluetooth in the world,"This is the worst product that I have ever bought. I never got the chanceto use it because both times that I bought, brand new, it didn't work.I am currently sending the other one back. The both had the same problem, Neither of them would charge and so the headset was always dead. The worst part is that I have already lost money in shipping that I can't get back. In the end this experiance has been bad. Don't buy this product."
1,Don't waste your money,"Bought this head set, after powering it on, unit would not work. Unit would not connect to the phone, in fact when i did some trouble shooting, it would not even stay powered on. I ended up tossing it in the bin.i won't be buying a Motorola headset again.Somehow i have to give this product 1 star, as the system won't let me leave it blank, however I give it 0/5"
4,pretty informative.,i liked this biography of bugsy siegel but i only wished it included more footage of bugsy. it kept showing the same five or six pictures of him over and over again.
1,Sony Sat - HD300,"We purchased this unit 18 months ago. The unit has failed twice. Sony replaced the unit the first time, post warranty, with only a shipping charge of $70. The second time I was instructed to take it to a local repair, $40 analysis, before repair. Seems that for over $600 there should be a better life expectancy. If you buy this unit, be sure to get an extended warranty. Many features on the non HD system far exceed the features on this unit."
2,new version/same problems,"I have the previous model, the HD-200 - the absolute worst AV purchase I've ever made. After being perpetually ignored by Sony's customer service reps, I'm not surprised to see that the same problems occur in the 300 model. I am really sick and tired of having to wade through 500+ channels to reset the custom program list (the only way to navigate so many signals), only to find it gone the next day. And the remote control doesn't work unless you are directly in front of, and close to, the unit. I have mostly Sony equipment, and have always considered it a good investment, until I got this $800 turkey. Sony should be ashamed for branding this (which, I understand, is actually made by Zenith). Buyer beware - it's a lot of money to regret spending."
1,"Audio Drop, Audio Drop, & Audio Drop","I've had the unit for about 3-weeks now and find random audio drop (1-2 seconds). Contacted Sony Tech and they said it is because of a DTV. Sony also said all other Sat Receivers had the same problem. I cannot believe this. I upgraded from the SAT-HD200 (no-audio drop) because I couldn't split the signal to two tv's without watching both at 480. The HD300 alleviated this problem and also comes with an exented RF Remote Control. Overall for the money, very dissatified."
1,"Buggy, buggy, buggy","Don't buy this thing!I've been wrestling with one all day and will return it. Here's a sampling of the problems:It has, for no obvious reason, frozen and restarted numerous times today.The channel guide always defaults to showing all channels in the guide every time you press ""guide."" You cannot delete any channels from the guide although you can hide them. Non-hidden channels are placed in a ""custom"" list. Unfortunately, the custom list is accessed by pressing guide (showing all channels) then scrolling down a list to select custom - each and every time you press guide on the remote! What genius thought of this? You can't delete any channel and guide always selects all channels so your kids can get to everything. There is a lock option to password protect channels but you can't lock a hidden channel! Very bad design. There's plenty more but you get the idea.Don't buy this thing. It isn't ready for prime time."
1,Shipping is terrible.,"This probably would have been nice enough considering the price, had it shipped normally. For some reason, it was shipped Media Mail and so the Post Office never delivered it...most likely because it is against policy to ship anything other than books that way. Also, after the estimated delivery date passed I had to contact the Post Office to find out it was shipped Media Mail. On my email confirmation it was listed as having shipped Parcel Post."
4,not bad for the money,"I am a little disappointed that you cant use the brighter hella halogen bulbs with these like the 90/130, but the beam pattern is very nice compared to the old 6054 xtravisions i had. if i had the money id have gone with the hellas, but these are great for what you pay."
5,Passes the sparkle test!,"This is a good investment if you old headlights are old and yellow. It can handle the H.I.D.upgrade for older models.The very first thing that I notices when I took them out of the packages, was the crispness of the reflecting area. Theyalmost looked like a NASA product. Seriously, these are nice looking plastic housings. I would but them again for the price. A+"
4,Great upgrade from sealed beam head lamps,This product is a great upgrade from sealed beam headlamps. It provides brighter light and looks modern. Now you can just replace the bulb than replace the whole headlamp. Great Product. I do not recommend HID's for this product people have the misconception that you can put HID's on any car headlamps. This is a Halogen Bulb set up. If you want HID'S you will need to get a projector set up to control the beam of a HID. Again great product and upgrade from sealed beam headlamps.
4,Good for the price but so-so beam pattern...,"I've bought similar conversions before and decided to try this one because of the low price. It arrived on-time, was a perfect fit, well-sealed and well-constructed for the price. However this is ALL PLASTIC, while some other conversions have glass lenses. I am a bit disappointed with the low-beam light pattern (it's worse than the replaced sealed beams), but that may change once I upgrade from the halogen Silverstar bulbs I'm using to HID. Regardless, It definitely LOOKS great and the beam pattern for high beams is FANTASTIC!Only removed a star because of low-beam pattern and plastic lenses."
3,Bought to replace sealed beams,Well they do the job but if you're going to be anal about the beam pattern there is a huge variance between the two. I managed to get mine adjusted to make the lows look good and account for the inconsistencies in the two patterns at the cost of the high beams not being worth a whole lot. I don't really need highs now though so that's the good news and they still work fine for flashing.
2,FOL-50/50 Sweatpants with Pockets,Items were in good condition but shipping info stated one thing and when I actually got it was another. Didnt think I would get it in time for Christmas. No idea where they were coming from. Was not very happy with this purchase
1,Using this book in the elementary classroom,"I teach third graders who read at a 5th-9th grade level. The first problem with this book is that, on the back, in huge, yellow letters, is, ""Learn more about your Christain heros! Read what traditional educators try to keep from you!"" Not a good thing to send home. This book was much too difficult for them, not just because of the unnecessarily thick language. It is very poorly written. The prose is wordy and full of characters who are only mentioned once and then forgotten. The children claimed to like and understand this book, but their retention and actual understanding was nil."
4,"If you've got an iPod and a camera, it gets the job done","I bought this reader to download photos from my smartmedia camera because smartmedia only has 128MB cards. It works, mostly as advertised. It is no where near the speed of a USB 2.0 reader, but it transfers at a reasonable rate. My main issue is the incredibly poor manual that came with it. One inserts SmartMedia cards with the gold connector ""up"" and not ""label side up"" as the manual states.Also, it takes a few seconds for the iPod to recognize the card, so don't be alarmed if it says ""no card inserted"" for a little bit.Overall a pretty good product, if your camera doesn't support the apple connector, this will get the job done."
1,Doesn't Work with 2G SD Memory Card,It doesn't work with SD Ultra II 2.0 GB memory card and Belkin technician said that it shouldn't work with anything more than 1GB.
2,Not as fast as they claim,"Though the concept is great, and the controls are straight forward and easy to use, the Belkin Reader falls short of usability.While out on a location, I was away from a power source and thought the Belkin reader would be a great alternative to lugging a laptop around for file transfers. Trying to transfer 1000 pics off a 1GB CF card wasimpossible. The reader would drain a fully charged ipod and still not finish the transfer. Though it claims firewire transfer speeds, I did some tests from home and found otherwise:100 compressed 2K pics transferred via:USB1 card reader to computer 1 min 20 sec.PCMCIA card reader in laptop 45 seconds.Belkin Media reader 6 min. 45 secThis was just a simple example. You can see how hundreds of files would take 30 minutes or more. For the price, I'd suggest buying a few more memory cards and not worry about the transfers until you get home, unless you're in no rush and can charge up the ipod regularly."
1,Not compatible with all ipods other than mini's,So I just purchased the reader to take on a trip figured it would be nice to have. Well not so nice if you have the ipod video because it's not compatible so just a heads up if you are going to buy this item.
1,Does not work with 5G IPOD,"I bought a Video IPOD 60gb and when I connected the Belkin Media Reader to it an error message popped up and said that the device currently connected is NOT compatable with this IPOD. So, I guess it is for OLDER IPODs (3G) only."
3,"Works with Sony Memory Stick, but NOT Memory Stick PRO","I bought this device to download pictures from the Memory Sticks used by my Sony digital camera when I am on vacation and away from my computer.The device works as advertised. It takes me 3-4 minutes to download a full 128 MB Memory Stick. No, that isn't super fast but it wasn't a problem for me.The biggest negative on this device for me was the fact that it can't read the new Memory Stick PRO media."
3,Practical but very pedestrian,"This book disappointed me. I've used Eating Well recipes in the past and have always been very pleased. The recipes in this book, however, are very pedestrian and geared to a novice cook. Quick cooking -- the kind that can be completed in 45 minutes -- can still be interesting and inventive. These recipes were just practical. Still, it's a well done book with nice photographs, and the health information is useful. I wish there were a real dessert section, though -- because desserts *can* be made in 45 minutes or less!"
4,Excellent Resource,I was quite surprised when I bought this book how much information is given for each dish. Nutrient content as well as calories per serving. One of the best things about this book is the diversity it offers. So many different ethnic based foods. I definitely recommend this book for those who are health consious and also wanting to try great food every night.
3,quick dinners,"This book is pretty good at quick light cuisine, but its not very original, like the magazine from which it comes, the ingredients are often very similar giving many of the recipes similar tastes. I have found at least four good recipes that my whole family have liked though- the turkey and peas is delicious and kid friendly. I recommend buying the magazine first- Eating Well, and then deciding on the book."
3,clasic for children,"I had read this book when I was a child,I read it again before I buy it for my grand children.this is one of the must reed books for children growing up."
2,poor writing,"A couple of interesting points about HK, but very cliched. An educated amah surprise surprise!Characters poorly developed. Dismal dialogue. Structure is good but the underlying story nothing special. There are 4 parts:- Part 1 is rubbish - you will end it hating the character and the author too.- Part 2 is much better- Part 3 - just a plot linking ploy- Part 4 - a decent ending.Could have been so much better."
1,Waste of Paper,What a waste of time. Hong Kong is a wonderful place with an infinate number of stories that could have been told about it. Too bad a bad writer with no imagination chose to do it. Some of the great events of our century pass by in this book with all the feeling of a trade journal.
4,Not a Lot Of Lego for $150,"This is a small Lego kit. It took my 12 year old 10 minutes to build the LEM, CSM and the Saturn V. He's having great fun with it though and is stripping down and rebuilding it into something new. So it's great but not $[...] great. Also the LEM is larger in scale than the CSM. Picky, I know but for $[...]."
4,Album 2 is the best,"Album 2, Seduction Time is the better of the two albums. It has great rhythm and beat and won't dissapoint you in the car, beach, or jogging. I downloaded the album into my MP3 player and thus can have greater portability. I would give it 5 stars but album 1,Dinner Time is just mediocre at best or upgraded elevator music.This album is must buy. My favorites include Midnight. The music is especially soothing and surreal when driving at night in a smooth lane."
3,Boot Blanket,"Hard to get on but do keep your feet warm. Should have up sized to the larger ones, went by the guidelines but that may be off"
2,"""SAS"" did not live up to expectations","I was disappointed w/ the DVD/video. It seems more like a glorified CNN report (with rather poor production/editing) than a truly informative, ""behind the scenes"" glimpse into this amazing special forces group. Save your money and buy something different."
4,very no-nonsense,"I enjoy and appreciate this particulat DVD. ""Soldier I"" has no flair for the dramatic and just explains how it was. He even cracks a few jokes. The narrator was a bit annoying but thorough. All in all a good watch."
2,Writing could be stronger,"I ordered this book to be read and discussed in a church book club discussion group. Most of us agreed that the book has some wisdom, particularly involving the concepts of trusting God and handling life's challenges with prayer. One of our group members is a widow who related well to Marion Bond West's description of early widowhood. However, the book seemed poorly organized and the writing lacked strength and depth."
4,Great book for dog lovers!,"Enrique,Bronx, New York:I love your book. You talking about reward training and not violent type training is great. The chapter when you have to put your dog to sleep is how it is. What's scary is the profanity my children have to see of the pit bull reviewers listed here; crazy people owning and training these dogs!"
5,"An absolute must for dog owners, or those who want a dog.","There are many dog training books on the shelves today. But, that is what they are, Dog training books. Lachman's book is different. It is about learning to live with your dog as part of your family. The techniques he uses to train the dogs are non violent, and easy to follow. He also includes advice for common problems like seperation anxiety and aggression. I have been using the techniques for aggressive dogs for 5 days, and am already seeing a difference in my malamute. In addition there are 2 chapters I think really stand out for me, and those were choosing the right breed of dog for you, and dealing with pet loss. I want a good dog, but I want a dog, not a robot. With Lachman's book you can have just that! With the familiar tone of the book, it easy to read and follow, and enjoy. If youhave a dog, or want a dog, Get this book. You will not be disappointed."
1,The fallacies that are presented,"the fallacies that this individual presents are a great concern as if these breeds are not having enough problems because of ""bad"" owners. Then we have this person presenting a ""know it all attitude"" that is completely false. A little more research would have provided for a more well written and properly informative book."
4,Dogs on the Couch offers a comprehensive look......,"""Larry Lachman's Dogs on the Couch, written with Frank Mickadeit, is another great addition to a pet enthusiast's library, especially for those contemplating adopting their first puppy or dog. From sibling rivalries to phobias to just not minding their owners, the authors cover common canine behavior problems. Lachman, for many years a counselor working with abused children and others in need, turns many of the same techniques he has used with people to training dogs. He stresses the need to involve all family members when you are working to prevent or change a dog behavior problem, and he eschews physical punishment, such as the jerk-and-release technique. Dogs on the Couch offers a comprehensive look at what to do and not to do to create a happy, well-adjusted pet."" --""Animals"" Magazine, July/August 1999"
5,Best guide to dog behavior I've read!,"What a great job the authors have done of making the understanding of our dogs possible -- through psychology. A great concept well executed. I found the chapters on ""Ongoing Training,"" ""Separation Anxiety,"" and ""How Traditional Training Can be Harmful to your Dog"" the most helpful. Very much in line with the books penned by the Monks of New Skeete. I found the instructions on how to work with the dominant dog when dealing with a two-dog household very helpful as I have a 6 year old female Golden Retriever and a 4 year old female Golden. The older dog is clearly dominant; but the younger dog often challenges her. Now I know what to do. Thankyou, authors, for a great guide book for those of us who love our dogs."
5,"Dangerous Dog, how true!","Being a retired mail carrier, your chapter on the two carriers who were severely mauled by two out of control pit bulls was right on! Close to 3,000 carriers are attacked and bitten each year. And from MY experience, the pit bulls do lock on to its victims and won't let go. They don't back down, and if residents who own this dangerous dog wake up and smell the roses, they would keep them locked away or get another kind of dog. What you wrote was right on and all this flap in here from pit bull, or as they seem to refer to them selves,""APBT"" owners just show how much in denial they are. People safety must come first! On behalf of mail carriers everywhere, THANK YOU!"
3,I learned new things from this book.,"I learned a lot from reading this book. I did not know much about the reforms of Pope John Paul and it was interesting to read how one group interpreted Vatican II. Not being a Catholic - I learned a lot about how the church is run - laws for operation, etc.This book is interesting. If you keep the authors perspective in mind when reading this you will enjoy it. Take the other reviews with a grain of salt."
1,"A work of fiction, not fact.","I compared to what I read in this work with the biographies of Cardinals McIntyre and Manning by Msgr. Francis Weber.It appears that Anita Caspary has attempted to write something that would absolve her and her accomplices of the guilt associated with killing the California arm of a once important Catholic order. Sadly it's fiction. And the practical proof is in the pudding as they say.While the Immaculate Heart Society (the lay, non-Catholic group) led by Caspary has dwindled significantly since their splitting from the Church, other female religious orders are now prospering strongly.I wish Ms. Caspary has the integrity and the resolve to issue an apology for all the pain and confusion she and he accomplices have caused."
2,A fairytale of a novel,"This book is nothing but bitter fantasy.If you want the facts on how the IHM fell, check out Msgr. Francis Weber's ""His Eminence of Los Angeles: James Francis Cardinal McIntyre"" from your local library or bookseller.Weber's work is based on fact, not fiction mixed with a large dose of misandry."
1,"Fiction, not the truth",The toxic spirit of Carl Rogers and the late 1960's/early 1970's killed the Sisters of the Immaculate Heart of Mary. They used sexism-feminism as their tool.It's too bad that Caspary chose to delve into fiction rather than to tell the truth -- including an apology perhaps.Thankfully her dissident type are finally dying out within the Church.May God bless those nuns who have stayed faithful to the IHM in Los Angeles.
1,NOT HAPPY,I didn't realize this was shipped from another country and the language was not ours very unhappy it took forever to get here also.Don't get :(
2,Good movies...,The movies are as expected but the Thai versions so everytime you watch it you have to set up the menu to English.The reason for the 2 stars is I ordered it Dec 14 and received it Jan 4. This was a Christmas present. When I inqured as to when I could expect delivery I was informed it could be Jan 25! No applolgies for not sending it out on time. I was very disappointed.
1,"This is an international version, with a bad menu","No where in the text does this say this is an international edition. It is Thailand addition, the menu is hard to read and doesn't react like you would expect when selecting English, it jumps to another language.It is a great story, but you should get the older version and Amazon should state in text that this is an international version. You should not have to blow up the view of the box to find it out.This was purchased for grandchildren that they could not work through the menu and had to be returned to Thailand."
3,Be careful,"This ships from Singapore....takes forever to arrive. It is not set up in English, but you can change that on set up menu on the DVD. The ""advertisement"" before the movie starts is sketchy."
5,in ruins gets a tougher sound,yes this band DOES sound as if in ruins opted for a toughersound on an album.
2,Break much too easily,"I purchased eight of these glasses in July. They were similar in size to Riedel Vinum Bordeaux glasses that I had purchased in the past but were much cheaper. I hand wash them and dry them in a drying rack. I am disappointed in the fragility of the glasses. I have had several break by just tipping over in the sink or bumping up against another glass or solid object. I don't expect crystal glasses to survive a fall onto the floor, but these just break much too easily. In the future, I will pay the higher price and go back to the Riedel Vinum."
4,Lovely glasses,"These glasses are the perfect size for tasting bordeau wines, clear with a lovely crystal ""ring"" and plenty of space for swirling, we'll use them often!"
1,terribly order,"I was so disappointed with this item. I had been looking for a nice quality wine glass. A bigger one than I had and so I choose this one. Big mistake, when I received it I was trying to figure out if it was plastic or glass. Now that's poor quality."
1,"Barely Acceptable for Beginners, I Suppose","I had these Spiegelau stems purchased for me as ""back-up"" glasses for very informal social gatherings. For wine gatherings as well as everyday dining at home we use Riedel Sommelier, an acceptable stem. These ""Vino Vino"" glasses are rather thick and poorly balanced and do not bring out the true qualities of the wine. They do not direct the correct flavors to the precise areas of the tongue. Breakage is not an issue as the responsibility for cleaning and sanitizing goes to our housekeepers. If they break a glass, they pay for it.I suppose these are acceptable for under $200 wines for beginners, but for us they simply will not do, as we do not touch any bottle of wine under $1000."
5,Great Red Wine Glass For A Great Price,"It has been 8 months since my purchase and I could not be happier. Packaging was great, none arrived broken. The Glasses themselves are elegant and durable - none have broken so far. They are brilliantly clear, perfect for assessing the color and viscosity of the wine. They are thin but not to the point of being overtly fragile, which I think is the perfect balance.Great for Bordeaux, Bordeaux blends, as well as the individual varietals permitted in its blend - Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Cabernet Franc, Petit Verdot and the two varietals which now are seldom used in Bordeaux; Carménère and Malbec. I also would not hesitate using this glass with Syrah, Tempranillo, Zin, and most Italian wines. The only reds (that I drink) I would use a different glass for would be Burgundies (Pinot Noir) and Nebbiolo, Spiegelau's Burgundy glass works well with these. As you can see this is probably the most versatile style of glass, it is a must for any wine drinker."
1,Very poor adhesion to steel,"After having a complete failure with this epoxy, I performed a simple test of steel-to-steel adhesion qualities for various adhesives. While this Permatex epoxy may have higher tensile shear strength than basic hot glue, putty-type epoxy, or contact cement, it did not adhere to the steel anywhere near as strongly as those products did; and definitely didn't come close to the adhesion qualities of my old standby, J.B. Weld. The Permatex epoxy simply pulled away from the roughened and cleaned steel when the metal test pieces were even slightly torqued.I found this epoxy to be quite useless for bonding steel to anything, and will now stick with J.B. Weld."
1,Great product but unrealistc price...,You can find this product almost in every well-known department stores or on the product's website and it is only $18. If you want to get the larger size it is $28. This product is overpriced... I returned the product when I realized that the market price is very low than here.
1,Stock footage and factual errors,"The videos are nice but the footage does not fit the battles and there are some annoying errors in the facts. The Kursk segment is the worst. Several shots of Tiger II (PzKw VI B) tanks that were not used at Kursk, several shots of German troops in winter gear (Kursk was high summer on the Russian plains) leaves one miffed.They keep referring to the Das Reich Adolf Hitler SS division. There was a 1st SS Leibstandarte Adolf Hitler division and there was a 2nd SS Das Reich division but they continually erroneously state this. Somewhat silly mistake. This is all extremely well known to historians and even casual students. The names of the SS divisions are well known. Couldn't get it right? Very surprising. I wonder what else they got wrong.I would choose something well researched over this fluff."
2,A complete disaster,"There were about a million piece to put together, and I didn't realize that it was painted plywood. It looks rather cheap and after 3 months, there's only one functioning drawer. It scratches easily and it was not worth the pain of putting it together. I still use the drawers, and to an outsider it doesn't look bad, but I'm the one who has to live with it."
3,Not good,"I bought this cd mainly for the last work (the Jolivet), and to be honest, it is not that good. It is sad that Mr. Tanaka is no longer with us, but this cd commits some no no-s. eg. bad intonation, bad tone, uneven sound between the piano and bassoon, and some unusual and weak sounding moments for a bassoonist with his reputation and credentials. I have yet to listen to his other cds, but I am not terribly motivated to do so after hearing this one. This cd will go on the shelf purely for reference in regards to the Jolivet trio. OK, it has some really nice moments too, particularly in the Dutilleux and the Pierne (despite its tempo issues)"
1,EWWWWWWWWWWW,I can not fairly rate this product as I have not been able to use it yet. It smells so bad and I can not get the smell out.
3,Lots of fuzz,"We like the weight and thickness of this blanket but after washing it to get rid of the smell--oh the fuzz that fell out! We shook it outside and rinsed and dried it several times. Still, big balls of fuzz stuck to the blanket. I finally hand vacuumed the entire thing on both sides, which took a ridiculous amount of time. So now it's a great blanket but I did not appreciate all the time it took!"
3,"Basically good, but don't trust the details","This book is useful to give a genereal overview of the situation in Iran to a north American reader. However, it clearly shows that the book has been written in a hurry to get it to the market while the Iran-Iraq 'Axis of Evil' issue is still really hot.Its problems include:-A lot of typos (Even Iran is spelled Iraq occasionally!)-Some historical inacuracy (e.g Ayatullah Khomeini was not yet in Paris during the 2500 anniversary celebrations as the book states)-and very bad handling of the Persian names (mixing first names, surnames and old-style titles)."
4,Wicked Tv... cosmtic problems,"The picture is awesome, and the interface is excellent. The big problem is that the black plastic frame around the screen SCRATCHES with just the slightest touch. Brush a fingernail along it lightly, while wiping dust... and you have a PERMANENT scratch. It's just so lame that Samsung would use such a delicate material for the frame around the screen. A bigger shame because the Tv is really good looking. Less so now for me! I'd get this Tv again in a heartbeat... but don't let anything near it if you want to keep it looking good. There's a little warning sheet somewhere in the packaging about this problem... but it is easy to miss or not take as seriously as it should be taken."
5,The Samsung LN-S3292D is an outstanding LCD TV,"The Samsung LN-S3292D has amazing picture quality especially when paired with a high-def signal. The sleek design of the piano-black cabinet along with the hidden speakers gives this model a look of elegance. The LN-S3292D has 5000:1 dynamic contrast ratio which make this model a terrific purchase if you can get it for less than $1,400. This Samsung model outshines Sony's 32"" Bravia models and it's a lot cheaper. I own it, and I give it a strong BUY rating.Pros: Outstanding picture quality, sleek black cabinet, multiple HDMI inputsCons: The lack of true two tuner picture-in-picture is a detractor, but it wasn't serious enough to keep me from purchasing this model."
4,"GREAT TV, but no full-screen HDMI (why not?)","Great TV, trustworthy delivery, excellent performance all around, EXCEPT FOR ONE THING. WHY NO FULL-SCREEN HDMI? One can expand the HDMI signal to encompass the full screen, but not at full resolution, and it doesn't occur automatically. The result is that regular DVDs do not have the full resolution one would expect, even if upconverted.Otherwise, monitor is amazingly bright and accurate, and good for any apartment and small living room. I cannot tell the difference between 720p and 1080p for 32"" unless I am 3-4 feet away, so don't bother with the 3251D model unless you just like to throw your money in the toilet.I'm a bit picky about audio, so I don't bother with the monitor's speakers and use my superior bookshelf speakers instead.Dynamic brightness make a subtle but meaningful difference.Lots of inputs/outputs, so you will have enough options unless you are looking to super-accessorize. If so, you might be better off getting a larger TV anyway."
2,audio sucks...,"the ""hidden speakers,"" i found out after buying this tv, are famously lousy...DON'T BUY THIS TV..."
1,Wish I could give it zero stars,"I ordered one of these on November 13, 2006. It arrived on December 6 (21 days later than expected). Worked fine for about two hours; then the picture disappeared. Sound still works fine, but no picture.I requested a refund from Amazon but they do not respond. I will never buy from Amazon again."
5,One of Avi's best books!,"The story starts off a little strange, with clues that tie into the middle and end of the book. It is about a 13 year old girl set to sail from England to the United States in the 1800's on a ship called the Seahawk. This book has a mixture of weird characters, including a prissy young woman, an arrogant but kind (at sometimes) captain with a temper, a one-armed man, and a black cook that works on the ship. Throughout the stroy, you see how people can change so rapidly in only a couple of months and how not everything is how it appears. It has a great ending that you would have never guessed would have happened, but I won't ruin the ending for you. I would recomend this book to many people, because I really liked it"
4,Great Action and Intrigue,"Mr. A's seventh-grade class was enthralled with the action and mystery, but they acknowledged a slow beginning. The class found the discourse of those in the Victorian Era fascinating and sad. They said one of their favorite characters, Zachariah, deserved to be treated much better than he was at that time. The beginning was a little slow for the students, but that did not detract from the adventure offered by the rest of the book."
5,Best book I ever read!!!!!!!,Words can't describe how good this book is. You owe it to yourself to read this book. I have read it several times and I still enjoy it every time. It is about a girl named Charlotte Doyle and how she becomes the center of a deadly voyage that changes her life.
5,This is the greatest book I've ever read.,Charlotte Doyle is a 13 year old girl who went on a ship to America. She faced a horrible voyage. She was going to be hung at dawn for killing someone. If you enjoy adventure books this book is for you.
4,It is a great book to read so it will inspire your kids.,"Charlotte a 13 year old girl goes on her fathers ship called the ""SEA HAWK"". After four days on the Sea Hawk Charlotte meets a black man named Zacharia."
2,I don't realy like the book.,"I am in the 6th grade and I have read a lot of books. Out of all of them this one is probably one of my least favorites. I am not trying to sound like a book hater, or what ever you want to call me (if you are reading this). Well there was some good parts in the book. Like the part when she climbs the top of the main mast. I am really sorry if you are a huge fan of this book, but seriously the first is like all about her crying about all this stuff that is going around in the ship. But, everyone has different oppinions. That is my opinion about the book. Thankyou for reading."
2,"Cornwall,NYsixgrader",I am a six grader. The book Charlotte Doyle at sometimes was good and wasn't good. In the essay/review I will talk about why I didn't like it.One reason why I didn't like it is because there were to many characters.
2,"Cornwall, NY 6th Grader","I am a 6th Grader. My review is on the book The True Confessions of Charlotte Doyle. I would give this book a 4 out 10. I didn't really enjoy this book that much because there were huge gaps between action and talking. The story begins with a girl named Charlotte Doyle who was leaving her school in Liverpool, England, where she was learning at the School for Better Girls. Her father sent out a ship to pick her up and take her back to America. The time period is the summer of 1832. The book isn't that exciting in the beginning, but at the end it gets more exciting. The ship is called the Seahawk, which is a haunted-looking boat. This story includes how Charlotte was at first but a gentlewoman, all the way to her becoming an expert sailor. That is my review on the book The True Confessions of Charlotte Doyle."
1,I didn't like it.,"I read this book for school and I absolutely disliked it. Itwas boring. I guess if you like books that take place in the1800's and the girls are prissy then this book is for you.In my opinion, they shouldn't have wasted the paper thatthe book was printed on!"
1,Ick!,I was forced to read this book for my gifted class in school. It was an AWFUL book. I have one word for it: ICK! It just goes on and on and on about her Seahawk journey. It jumped around from her cutting rope on the mast to being on the main deck! It was so strange.. the plot; everything! I'm surprised it has good reveiws. But it's just my opinion about this ICK-ish book.
1,The True Confessions of Charlotte Doyle,"This is one of the most boring books I have ever read. It is completely uninteresting and undramatic. Do yourselves all a favor and put this book down. Its not worth reading, it will make you go to sleep. Avi has written many amazing novels, this is not one of them."
3,Review by a 15-Year-Old Girl,"This is an amazing adventure story by a remarkable writer. Charlotte is such a vibrant character that I feel as if I know her.On her trip, which she embarks upon in order to be reunited with her family, she discovers that pretty much everything her parents ever told her is wrong. I totally agree with that, but you kind of get the impression that nothing is really right or wrong, you just have to decide what is best for yourself no matter what the cost. I am not at all saying that what Charlotte does is wrong, but there is another message hiding behind her story, so be careful! A much better choice is ""The Witch of Blackbird Pond"" by Elizabeth George Speare."
5,Best book by Avi,"This book was a great read. It definetly held my attention. The best part was the suspense in the book. It kept me trying to guess what would happen next. I was disapointed when I finished it because I wished it was longer. If you want to read this book, you should. It is worth it."
4,The Review Of Charlotte Doyle,"I thought the book was ok. The reason I thought it was ok is because it was too detailed for me. Also if you like cliffhangers you will like this book. Cliffhangers are when at the end of the chapter they just leave off. Then you want to keep reading. If you like to read detialed books then you will want to read this book. It seems like you are actually there. I like that it fells really cool. There are 3 main charaters. They are Charlotte Doyle,Captain Jaggery,and Zahariah. So read this book."
3,True Favorite!,"This is an excellent high-seas adventure novel for girls and boys alike! In the 5th grade, I found myself utterly caught up in Charlotte's world of drama and intrigue! It's fast paced, it's fun, and it's still a favorite of mine!"
4,Such and such,"I liked this book. Af first is was pretty boring but then it got really good. I think girls would appreciate this more than boy would. I was glad that it had action in it because at first I didn't think it would. I would recommend this book to most people, but not all. My favorite part was scene 21, which has some lovely acting, and is only a swallows flight away from the storm. An unladen swallow, that is. Unless it was two laden swallows. But not two unladen swallows. Anyway, they are in a hurricane and it is a very tense and important scene. I would give this book a four and a half but that isn't an option."
4,Why you should read this book that is right here in front of you?,"This book is about the main charactor whos name is in the title of the book (Charlotte Doyle). It is like hero vs. villian only the hero doesn't have super powers and the villian is a captin named Captin Jaggery. It isn't the most perfect book to read to your self before bed but, after bed becuase it will give you nightmares(trust me). The book is also like Pirates of the Carribean only there is no Jack Sparrow I mean Captin Jack Sparrow nor the Black Peral. Well, you get the point. It is a combanation of hero vs. villian and Pirates of the Carribean. So read the True Confessions of Charlotte Doyle and if you agree this a book with excitment and has a long name."
4,The Ture Confessions of Charolette Doyle By. Avi,"The True Confessions of Charolette Doyle is an exciting books. It is about a 13 year old girl sailing from England to meet her family in America. After getting on the ship she relizes it is not for her. The saliors are mean and it is not a place for a young lady. She goes through many trasportations. At first she thinks she can trust well dressed Captin Jaggery, but soon relizes his seceret. On her voyage she becomes a new person. She surrvied a hurricane, she becomes part of the crew, and is accused of murder. She learns that she can trust the people she thought she could never trust. She becomes friends with different people and loves being free of her upper class postion her father and mother taught her. find out what happends next and read this amazing book by Avi.This amazing book is filled with excitment and a lot of drama. This is a New Berry honor award winning book by Avi, and now I see why."
5,Adventure on the High Seas,"The True confessions of Charlotte Doyle is a rip-roaring good read. Charlotte, the heroine of the story, undergoes an incredible transfomration during the course of the novel. When we first meet Charlotte she is a prissy, pompus, aristocratic 13 year old girl. By the end of the story, she has grown into an empathetic young woman with a heart and a mind of her own. Her perilous trans-Atlantic journey from England to Rhode Island makes for plenty of heart-pounding moments. I highly recommend this book to middle school boys and girls alike. However, it might hold a special place in the hearts of girls who are struggling to resist expectations that they conform to traditional notions of femininity."
3,A review for a good book,"It is a very nicely plotted and written book, told with detail and with not a single dull page. Avi's 'True Confessions of Charlotte Doyle' propels you into an incredible trip on the sea. The story flews very easily to be understood. It is a very delightful light reading. I personally liked it very much, and I really liked Avi's style of using 'I' in the story. When I began to read the story I thought that it was written by the protagonist, Charlotte herself. He makes it sound like he is the protagonist. He really gets into the stories he writes, and this must be probably one of the bests."
5,"Still love this book, years later","I first read this book in the fifth grade, after buying it at the school book fair (with my own money! I was so proud). I loved it, and re-read it several times over the next few years. Probably several times a year, really. I lost it at some point, or maybe I gave it to my little sister... I can't remember. But now *somenumberof* years later, taking my daughter to her first school book fair, it made me think of this book that I loved so much as a kid. I couldn't remember the name, but I did remember the main character's name was Charlotte so I did some searching and finally found it! I read it again and it really is as good as I remember.All that to say, Avi is a great author and story-teller, and this is a great book. It's one of many on the list to give to my daughter when she's older."
5,A Good Yarn,"This story is very exciting with a strong, interesting plot. I enjoyed reading it, especially the part where Charlotte climbs to the highest point of the ship. The description was good and although to begin with Charlotte is very naive, it gives one a feeling of superiority to feel that we know more than she does. And the ending is extremely satisfying."
4,The True Confessions of Charlotte Doyle,"The True Confessions of Charlotte Doyle was a spirited adventure book. Charlotte Doyle is a thirteen year old girl who was always lavished and pampered by her parents. Charlotte was in England for seven years and was going back to her home in Rhode Island to be with her parents. She was travelling on a ship named the Seahawk. When she boarded, she saw grimy and odd looking sailors, a fledgling firstmate, and a hospitable captain with a morbid past. Charlotte becomes a vital bystander in a crime and also was the prime suspect of a homicide. I think this book is well written and I am amazed at how an adult male can narrate a story from a thirteen year old girls' point of view."
4,This book is very exciting and suspenseful!,"The True Confessions of Charlotte Doyle is a entertaining book. It is a story of a young girl from a wealthy family who sails to America alone. She is caught in a dangerous quarrel between the captain and the crew. She is very ladylike, naive, and not used to the crude ways of living ona ship. She gradually undergoes a change of attitude and learns more about people. The author describes his characters very well. Each character has the perfect attitude for the part they in the story. This book however, is very unrealistic in many of the circumstances, but because it is unrealistic it is more exciting. The author chose a very good setting for this story and describes the ship very well. I think the book could use a map in the front to give an idea of where she was going. The ending has great comparison between two different worlds and is quite unexpected. It is a very intriguing and interesting book on the whole."
4,"the book was great, I loved it","I have just read the book ""The True Confessions of Charlotte Doyle"" by Avi, this book was both an adventure novel and a mystery. There were three main characters in this book, they were Charlotte, Captain Jaggery, and Mr. Zachariah. Charlotte was thirteen years old and before she went on her voyage she attended the Barrington School for girls in Liverpool, England. Captain Andrew Jaggery was a brutal captain to his crew, he also befriended Charlotte in the beginning of the story, before she accidentally whipped in the face. If you like adventures and aren't afraid of reading about blood and gore. The book was great I think I would rate it an eight. I hope you like it to.by, Dana Pfister"
4,Fantastic,"A fantastic trilling adventure that takes you on a daring sea voyage with a proper, perky young lady that is sailing with a stuffy dirty crew. She is an only women passenger with a mean captain and a crew that keeps to themselves. Will she servive muchless stay proper?"
4,wonderfuly good book,Zachiria was getting wiped by the captian.Mrs. Doyle thaught the others killed zacheria.Then wen Mrs.doylewas sitting their he saw Zachiria agian.Zaciria was hidding in the jall sallfrom the capiton.Then the captian saw Zachiria alive.

He threw the key at her and said take what you want.
3,This book is a FANTASTIC book to stay home relax and read,"Hi!!! WATZ UP!! I have got to tell you about this farout book called, The True Confessions Of CHARLOTTE DOYLE!!!!!! This book is about a voyage and only one girl is on this ship of guys. The book starts off with her trying to be friends with some guys.Towards the end they blame for a murder that occurred on the ship. It gets all violent and a lot of people trying to trick each other. I don't want to spoil the great time you would have reading it so,if you want to know about it more you better read it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,A wonderful book,"A great story of action and adventure. Wonderfully characterized.A story told with meaning. Charlotte,the captain and the crew'smoods and actions are very realistic."
3,An Average Novel,"This book I found to be an overrated novel about a girl coming home from boarding school on a sailboat. Her trip across an ocean, was by far imaginative and unbelievable. Never in my oppinion would a young girl do the things that Miss Charlotte Doyle did. Although I enjoyed reading this novel, I cannot say that I didn't, but it was a book I could not get into because it was so extreme. No girl would stow away on a ship after going through that kind of a tramatic experience. This is definetely a novel for imaginative, not someone who is as down-to- earth as I find myself to be, for I found this unbelievable."
1,"Slow, confusing, and overrated","If you were to read the back of the book, you'd think that it would be an interesting, thrilling story. You'd be wrong. ""Charlotte Doyle"" is so slow-paced, the title character is not accused of murder until at least half-way through the story...and this is supposed to be the main plot point!It's also confusingly written. I'm sure I'm not the only one who had a great deal of trouble understanding what was going on.This book isn't worth your time.--Anna N."
1,What a disappointment!,"This historical mystery novel about a teenage girl travelling from England to America by sailing ship won a Newberry award and was well reviewed, so I had hoped for a work of quality liturature. I found the characterisations flat, the twists of the plot unbelivable, and the violence excessive and gratuitous. Worst of all, the book promotes a Marxist/radical-feminist agenda all the way to its surprise ending. The one positive thing I can say about it is that it gives a better description of how a sailing ship works than any other historical novel I know of. However, I would not recommend it to anyone."
1,cornwall NY 6 grade,"I am a 6 grader. The book I will tell you about is THE TRUE CONFETIONS OF CHARLITE DOYLE. It was a very touching book , it was about a girl that boards a ship called the SEAHAWK. It was good because it talked about a girl that was framed for killing a man"
1,OK,"I didn't like it because it's not that exciting, It doesn't have a lot of action, and I only like a couple of chaptes."
3,The True Confessions of Charlotte Doyle review,"This book was not great but not bad. It took a while for the book to get interesting. The author did a good job at the end of some chapters with building up suspense. It made me want ot read more. Most of the book was predictable.It was easy to read. The author did a good job giving images and characteristics of the characters. The author actually got me attached to one of the characters. The character of Captian Jaggery was really interesting: however, at times it wasn't very believable. The whole time I spent reading the book I was waiting for a dramatic mutiny. The whole trial was not believable but interesting. If I were maybe three years younger I would probably had enjoyed this book more."
4,Very Good Book,"I remember reading this book several years ago. I'm not sure how old I was...somewhere between between 10 and 12 (I'm now 24). I probably got it at a Scholastic Book Fair or through a Scholastic order. This was one of the first true novels that I ever read.I'm sorry to say that I can't remember much about the book other than the main character, Charlotte, a wealthy young girl, becomes a working crew member on a ship. I think she disguises herself as a boy. I thought it was fascinating as she learned the workings of the ship and became a true sailor. This was a very engaging story and I hope to read it again someday to refresh my memory. I recommend this book for anyone who enjoys a good adventure story."
3,"Cornwall,NY Sixth Grader",I am a sixth grader. In the book Charlotte Doyle is a girl that takes a voyage on a ship called the Seahawk. On the way there are big storms and a couple of deaths. In the book there are many problems Between Captain Jaggery and Charlotte Doyle.
3,"Cornwall, NY 6th grader","I am 6th grader. This book is about a girl who boards a ship called the Seahawk bound for her home in America. When on the ship she is introduced to new things, the crew with their rough language and their dirty appearance, and the ways of a ship. I thought this was an good book and would recommend it to everyone who likes ships and action."
4,This book was Exciting and made me want to keep reading.,This book iss about a girl who goes on a ship. just her and the crew and captain. when she arrives she thinks she is better then all of the crew but she likes the captain. In the end she ends up apart of the crew and they all hate the captain. Read this book to find out the rest you will enjoy it very much.
5,A Great Book!!!!!,"This used to be my favorite book when I was a little bit younger. I instantly fell in love with it. You are transported back in time. I love Charlotte! She was incredibly brave. The ending couln't have been better. You should definitely read it, what more is there to say?"
4,Excellent,"It has been about six years since I have read this book and I read it in third grade. Last year my friend joined a group that read this book. I asked her how she liked it and she said it was wonderful, I couldn't do anything but agree with her."
5,wonderful,"this book is hard to beet. i like books with meaning to them this one was about a girl who starts out being a ""lady"" and becomes a ""man""."
3,an ok book,"I the book Charlotte Doyel Charlotte is a proper young lady that is supposed to go to America with other Families. However, the other families Don't show up when it's time to go to America. on the ship Charlotte is the only girl and ther are sloppy dirty men on bord (the crew).She has a very small cabin by her self.

Charlotte is blamed ,has a tryal and is found guilty. What will happen to Charlotte? Who really did kill Mr. Holly Brass? Read it and find out.I didn't really like this book but it was ok. It was sort of slow and not to exciting. the beginning didn't ckeep my attention but the rest was preety good."
2,"Cornwall, NY Sixth Grader","Iam a sixth grader.I recently completed reading ""The True Confessions of Charlotte Doyle"". Uniquely, my individual opinions of this designated story vary. I believe the author, Avi, sufficiently implemented immensely sophisticated vocabulary, which was a distinct highlight of the story. Yet I also believe that the author extended and described in intensely excruciating details the rather uninteresting personal emotions and various other extremely unnecessary sections, whereas there was an exuding lacking amount of exciting, highly stupendous, exhilarating sequences. In conclusion, I believe this story is a sufficiently-organized, fair book."
5,Enjoyable for everyone!,"This book is good because it had a lot of detail, and that makes it seem so real. What I liked so much about it was that it left you on the edge of your seat. You couldn't tell what was going to happen next. For all that Avi has done with her talent, it is definitely worth the effort for the reader."
4,"It is very well written, interesting and exciting!","The True Confessons of Charlotte Doyle is an exciting sea story. Everything is described, so you get to know the ship and characters almost as if you had been present. Each character well suits the time period. The way their personalities clash and blend makes the book interesting. Surprising circumstances combine with non-stop action, making the story interesting. However, there are unrealistic parts, like when Charlotte shares the forecastle with the sailors. Girls of that time and now would not be safe doing that. She is naive in assuming that all gentlemen are trustworthy, all sailors wicked and lazy. It would be nice to have a colorful diagram of the Seahawk, including Charlotte's room. Over all, The True Confessons of Charlotte Doyle is a very good book!"
5,A High Seas Adventure by a 12 year-old reader,The True Confessions of Charlotte Doyle is a WONDERFUL book!!! It was very suspensful and exciting. If you have not read this book you definetly should. It is the best book I have read in my whole life!!!!
3,So-so,"This was a cute book with a cute story, But I wouldn't say that it is a favorite. I couldn't relate to the characters which is why it wasn't exciting for me. It had an exciting story, but it's not really my type of book."
2,Could have been better,"Started out kinda dull, but got much better after a few chapters. Charlotte was deceived about what was going on and it took her a while to realize it. All in all it was ok."
2,It Took Too Long For The Excitement to Happen,"I give this book 2 stars. This book is pretty exciting, but it took too long for the excitement to happen. I was practically falling asleep.The book had to introduce everybody before all the killing happened. So if you're the patient type who likes murder mysteries, I would recommend this book."
3,So-so,"This was a cute book with a cute story, But I wouldn't say that it is a favorite. I couldn't relate to the characters which is why it wasn't exciting for me. It had an exciting story, but it's not really my type of book. It was kind of slow, too. It took a while for the ""Story"" to start. It wasn't too easy to understant either."
2,it was ok but it wasnt that good,"This was an ok book to be honest but..i wouldn't consider it to anybody in this book it seems like it tells your more about the parts of a ship than the actual plot which happens in in the middle, not to mention its so slow paced book until close to the middle."
5,The Quintessential Avi,"I taught seventh grade language arts for ten years, and apart from ""The Hobbit"", I never got a more universal positive response for a book than this. The real triumph here is in point of view. Avi Wortis writes not as an adult, but a child, not as a man, but as a girl, not in the present time, but in the past. Kids love this book, boys and girls both, because the story is always moving and there's no dead time in the text. Suspense is omnipresent. Avi works a real spell here, unlike in others of his books, which have a tendency to wander. Highly recommended.(This review has been posted by Marcus Damanda, author of ""Teeth."")"
4,"Cornwall NY,6 grader","Im A Sixth Grader I like the book for many reasons; one reason is the ships and the action. This book is filled with mysteries, murders, and confessions, that's why it's called the True Confessions of Charlotte Doyle. I just wish the author put in pictures and lesswriting."
3,"Cornwall,Ny 6th grader","I am a 6th grader. I read the book the true confessions of Charlotte Doyle. The author Avi is recognized for the Newbury honor award for the true confessions of charlotte Doyle. I read the book in school, and I did not like it very much, but I might recommend it to another person. If you liked the preview you can find it in the library the title is the true confessions of charlotte Doyle. If you like adventure and murder mysteries this is the book for you. The book is about a girl who is forced by her father to board a ship for three months. While board the Seahawk there is a big storm and murder is committed. I thought the book was ok!"
4,reviewing the book True Confessions of Charoltte Doyle.,"This book is a fiction book. It is about a girl named Charlette who goes on a voyage, because her father tricks her into thinking it would be like a cruise. He lies. There was a mean captain who treats the girl very mean. A murder happens in the book and she gets blamed for it.The ship she is on is the Seahawk. She stays on the ship for almost a year.Charlette meets a boy named Zachariah. They become best of friends.He helps her through rough times.he gives her a knife to protect her in case anything should happen.Towards the end someone takes the knife.The person who stole the knife tries to kill someone and someone else gets blamed and might go to trial and be put to death.I recommend this book to anyone who likes a lot of action and who likes to try and predict what will happen."
4,"Cornwall,NY,6th grader","I am a 6th grader. The book `The True Confessions of Charlotte Doyle"" is a pretty good book. In the beginning of the book it is not that good. It was kind of boring. But then in about the middle of the book it starts to get better. Then all these things are happening like there is a trial. Charlotte is framed for a murder and guess what happens? Well you'll have to read the book and find out. Oh I also recommend this book to you if you like books about ships and action. Thanks for reading my review."
3,Cute kids book,"For fun and giggles I decided to read this book again. I read it a long time ago when it was more age appropriate for me. This is a nice period piece that covers a young woman's journey through things. If you liked Pirates of the Caribbean you are very likely to enjoy True Confessions of Charlotte Doyle. It is age appropriate, but it is also enjoyable and amusing for the older crowd if they wish to watch that."
3,Feeling a little uncomfortable????,"Charlotte Doyle is trapped on a ship called the Seahawk, with 9 men by her side she is very unconfortable.She learns how to toughen up and take her bad and try to see the good. With help from her new friend Zachariah.At the bad side of the captain, he is not taking care of her in any way. This book is not a appropriate for immature minds. Too much violence and vulgar language and action. Other than that this is a great book!!!!!!!"
3,Charlotte Doyle Review,Charlotte Doyle is a very action-packed book. It has a very detailed plot and very surprising twists. I would reccommend this book to 6th-7th grade students. It has a long list of characters which are all included deeply. I also think this book could have more details though. This is a very good book!
5,Five Sea Stars,"Thoroughly researched and thoughtfully constructed, this book offers something for everyone interested in exploring the amazing underwater landscapes of the USVI. Beginning divers and snorkelers will appreciate the overview of practicalities about how to get there, various underwater options, and other things to do when your extremities start to get pruney from all that time in the water.More expert divers and those already familiar with the area can flip right to the heart of the book and delve into the descriptions of the many dive/snorkel sites. On our recent trip we stuck entirely with St. John, and I heartily agree with the author's assessment that Leinster Bay is one of the best snorkeling spots on the island. We can't wait to go back.My only recommendation for the 2nd edition of the book would be to include even more sites accessible from shore for those spur-of-the-moment snorkeling expeditions.We will definitely be bringing this book along on our next trip to the USVI!"
2,Do Not Order,I ordered this part and a week n a half or so later I finally e-mailed them about my order and they just refunded my money. They do not have this part......so I wouldn't both.A earlier rely to my order letting me know this would have been helpful.
3,Irish History,"This book is generally a disappointingly dry read. However, it is an excellent resource and I have found it useful."
3,Not bad but not sure if it's worth the effort,The notebook is built like a rock. with a lot of nice little features (love the light that allows you to type when it's totally dark). I dropped it a couple of feet and nothing happend ....One problem: it's a bit slow with only 256MB RAM and the wireless drivers are pretty bad without upgrading. When you upgrade from the Thinkpad webpage it is usable but still buggy. As a DVDplayer/remote terminal it is a nice deal.
4,Great product,"This product works extremely well in eradicating pesky acne. As described, it goes on clear and does not leave a shiny residue where the gel has been applied. There is a slight alcohol smell, but not too bad and it does not last. As a warning, like most acne products, it makes the zits more red before they start to get better (about a day). I have not experienced any skin irridation or dryness from this product. Yay!"
5,I recommend this product,This monitor came very fast. Once I received it I installed it into my car. The quality of the pics and video is great crystal clear. For the price it is wonderful. I also have place a video of it on youtubelet me know what you think!!!! The plastic is still on it.[...]
4,Nice and bright,"I've used the same light assembly on three motorbikes, daily commute and long distance, replacing bulbs about once a year. These bulbs are great for visibility but too bright to run constantly at night. Only bad thing is the two-prong connection, it's a little flimsy and can break if not careful."
4,Driving Lights,"Best Standard Driving Light Compared To H.I.D.. Very Bright Output From Compact Size. Very Quick Shipping, Got In 3 Days Without Paying Extra."
2,CerwinVega quality has dropped since being bought by Stanton Group,"I bought this sub expecting great things, and overall I was disappointed. The sub does pack a lot of bass, but generally it's boomy, loose bass without real punch or control. The louder you turn it up the louder the boomy, hummy bass becomes, but it never transcends to the kick/thump you want. Also, and this is my biggest gripe with the unit, after a few months of use the amp started to die and now the sub makes a cracking noise any time it's in standby and sometimes even when it's on. It pops, snaps, and generally annoys me so much that I've replaced it with a Klipsch SUB-12 that goes MUCH lower and sounds much more controlled. It also has a lot more power for solid kicks. I think CerwinVega is just a name now, the quality is gone since the company was sold to the Stanton Group, a Chinese consortium that makes the subs at bottom dollar, slaps the CW name on them. Buyer beware."
2,Save your money,"Our kids were given two of these for Christmas.The worked fine and easy to upoad music on.HOwever, the on/off switches were poorly designed and within a few months they broke off and left the player useless.I have since bought a $13 Coby player and it has stood the test of time. I wish we would have gotten the cheaper ones first and saved ourselves a whole lot of trouble."
2,Beware of the battery-it's NOT replaceable,"I purchased three of the Disney Mix Sticks, as well as some cartridges with songs. My kids also downloaded some of their favorite songs onto the sticks. Unfortunately, one of the sticks seems to have gotten more use than the others and now the battery is dead. I called Disney Electronics and they suggested I format the stick, which didn't help. Then they said I could return it to them and they would replace the battery for $30. The player only lasted a little over 4 months. There's no point in paying that much for a repair when I can purchase a new one for nearly that amount. They are very nice for kids to have for their music needs, but they should last longer, or at least have a replaceable battery. Very disappointing for a Disney product."
1,Worthless and aggravating!,"My daughter saved her money to buy an MP3 player and I thought this would be the most kid friendly, user friendly one she could buy. It has never worked...we tried to load it on her computer and it said that the player was corrupt and it was disabled. I uninstalled it and tried it again and still nothing! Ok, I figured I would try it on my laptop, however the software does not come ready for windows vista! To top that, there is no download to set it up on windows vista. So here we are, wasted money and no player. Don't waste your time or money on this piece of junk!"
2,Disney Mix Stick,We decided to let the kids open one present each before Christmas and my daughter chose the Disney Mix Stick. We found out the mp3 wasn't working properly because the battery was already near dead. Now we have to send it back and hopefully she will get her replacement before Christmas day.
3,An addendum to the first review,"Yes, this work has shortcomings in both analytical precision and chronological awareness. But there are some very useful sections. Foremost is the section on writing and ""record keeping."" It counters many notions of written language as superior to ""oral"" cultures in war or conflict by showing the ways in which both forms of record keeping rely on many of the same bases for validation and reproduction. This is a good argument to keep in mind when reading even such accomplished works as Jill Lepore's The Name of War, which emphasizes, though in a complex way, the superiority of written language in cultural contestation."
1,Poor Attempt at Indian History,"Shoemaker tries to sell the idea her book breaks new ground by looking at the ways Indians and Europeans shared similar cultural constructs throughout the 18th century. For instance, both groups used gendered language to call the other ""women"" as a form of insult. However, Shoemaker's analysis never goes beyond description and the vital concept of change over time is lost in a book too full of description and woefully lacking in critical analysis.I suggest saving your money and reading Richard White's The Middle Ground, which is a much more nuanced argument about Indians in 18th century North America."
3,recording first rate; performances diffident,"It would be nice to fully praise this CD, and tip my hat to David Hurwitz in appreciation for having highlighted it for me (he gave it a 10/10.)But I can't. Shockingly for this violinist (and, frankly, this repertoire) he sounds like he's phoning it in. Better renditions of the humoresques are to be found on BIS (Kang), coupled with other pieces performed with greater charm, wit and elan. Here's also to wishing Philips would re-release Accardo's version of the humoresques too.Sibelius: 6 Humoresques / 2 SerenadesAs always, the Ondine recording is very good. And, Kuusisto is a great young violinist with real passion. But he's had better outings on some of his other recordings."
2,Holes in it,"The cover we received was nice & bright, however ther was a hole in it right out of the box on the orange sun behind Betty's head..I e-mailed you about it & nothing got done...We are all done with ordering from Amazon....thanks"
2,Cute while it lasted,"I had received one similar (with bigger artwork and brighter colors) as a gift but that one came off in the drive through car wash and by the time I discovered it missing it couldn't be found. I bought this one as a replacement and originally was happy with the artwork thought the colors were darker and duller than the original. I live in Southern California and park outside. Within a year the artwork faded and lost most of it's color. Although the cover still protected my spare, I bought it for the artwork and that did not hold up. I have since then sold the car and don't have an outside spare anymore. Next time I need a spare cover I will buy a plain one locally for a lot less money."
3,The colors fade suddenly,"This cover got 3 stars because the colors virtually fade to an off white after 2 years. Maybe I expected too much? The material is very good with no signs of splits anywhere after riding on a Bronco's spare tire, in the desert, in the sun, for 3 years. I will buy another when this one starts to come apart. I just won't expect the colors to stick around even with regular cleaning and use of a vinyl preservative. I'll bet the colors would still be there if I could park in our garage. But you know how that goes."
2,In Peril on the Sea,I thought this book was very boring but in teresting at the same time it was kind of sad when they got lost in the sea. I encourage anyone interested in knowing the names of at least 50% of all the battle ships and war slangs to read this book.
1,Not even written well.,"It has been proven that to write a Kennedy assassination book one does not need to have their facts straight (as this book does not). But it should be well written. While I could get my money back when I returned the book, I could not get back the time I wasted reading it."
2,Too much fluff and not enough HARD evidence,"Oliver Stone had to have something to go by and as a result his movie is as confusing as this book. Heresay and guessing just to sell a book. Shameful. I bought it, read it and then re-read it but I just don't believe a plot existed outside of the twisted mind of LHO. Now, if you read it you MUST also read the anti-Marrs version ""Case Closed"" by Gerald Posner. After all, fair is fair."
1,Ridiculous,"If you buy this book's thesis, you are accepting exactly what the KGB and Cuban DCI wanted Americans to believe. Instead, read a book on the Kennedy assassination by Edward Jay Epstein, especially ""Legend."""
1,Tin Foil Hats on too Tight,"You got to love Jim Marrs, with books like ""Rule by Secrecy: The Hidden History That Connects the Trilateral Commission, the Freemasons, and the Great Pyramids"" you know you are in the presence of true ""Wackoism""So it's no surprise that old Jim is also into Aliens, Chemtrails and other such Woo Woo AND the main man of the grassy knoll crowd.If you believe the rot in this book then I know this guy in Nigeria who has millions of dollars he need to get to the US and he will split it with you if you only................."
1,Tough read.,"A lot of facts, interviews and quotations that seem to be randomly placed. It is a tough read because of the poor punctuation and sentence structure. There is also a lot of unnecessary repetition. Many passages have to be read and reread to understand what the author is trying to say. There is a lot of information, but no real conclusion as to the real killer, the real motive, or conspirators"
5,Jim Marrs will go down in history...,"Without a doubt, Jim Marrs will enter history for CROSSFIRE. Besides being utilized by Oliver Stone in his epic ""JFK"" movie, CROSSFIRE has opened new doors of awareness regarding the public execution of John F. Kennedy. Researchers and interested parties of ALL ages should find CROSSFIRE to be a wealth of information regarding the cover-up of the murder of the President of the United States. The truth is at hand. Take heed!"
2,Gatekeeper,"Jim Marrs is a gatekeeper pure and simple. If you want to know the truth then watch Oliver Stone's, 'JFK'. The assassination WAS a Washington conspiracy. Oswald most certainly was a dupe and a patsy. I have read this book and it keeps you away from the true facts.As I said, a Gatekeeper."
5,"full of information, worth reading","Jim Marrs clearly knows his subject, there can be no doubt about that.If I had to criticize his book it would be for the reasons below :a. the first couple of chapters try and convey too much eyewitness information all at once.b. Marrs presents various theories as to what really happened but he does not tell us what he believes happenedThe two above points aside, this is a compelling book that could almost definitely sway the most ardent Warren Commission fan.If I were you I would buy it!"
3,"Good, but not great","While this book contains a lot of good and interesting information, it is a little biased in ways. And, that is not to say the information that it presented isn't accurate or fair, because I think it is. However, when presenting some of the items I wish the book would have presented some of the arguments against some of the theories in the book so that the reader can make up their mind for themselves."
4,Marrs is nothing if not well named,"It is hard to believe a single word in this book, but it is never the less a great read. Marrs seems to search to the depths of the planet to find the one doctor or witness out of 100 that will agree with his ""findings"". If he hits a dead end, hey just make it up, why not? I have to give it a positive review because it is a great place to start for the junior conspiracy theorist in all of us. It is more or less a rehash of every other conspiracy book rolled into one. Read this, High Treason, and Posner's Case Closed and then decide for yourself."
5,Crossfire: The lot that Killed Kennedy,"Well written, very easy to understand,details, that really get you to thinking, that there is definitely a possibility of a conspiracy. An enjoyable and fascinating book to read.I recommend this book for anyone who would be interested in research of this topic."
4,A Fascinating Look into the Kennedy Assassination,I really enjoyed this book it walks the reader through almost every aspect of the Kennedy assassination and the circumstances around everyone directly or sometimes indirectly involved. My only complaint is some of the information is constantly repeated for example witnesses stories or other information will be brought up time and time again. I also thought it could have benefited by showing more pictures of physical evidence to help give some context on the physical evidence or people involved in the book. Overall though an intriguing and thought provoking book.
4,Great Record- Nasty Sound,This brilliant album has not recieved the love it deserves (that goes for Harry's entire catalog). These Camden remasters sound like they were sourced from 27th generation tapes. Go for the newly remastered Japanese releases. They sound great!
2,Not so great!,I am a big Bee Gees fan so I thought this would be good. Not crazy about it. I would pass if i had it to do over.
4,Blues Gold,"This CD is a must for any person who wants to truely understand the history of our people. The song really express the love, the pain, and yes even the hate that time brought to the lives of us. The instruments seems to take on a life of there own it is like they became one with the singer. The words reflect the mood of today life styles for many. I think that the BLUES GOLD shoul dbe in evry ones collection. One listen and you will understand."
4,Good History,"Well written overview of the history of these battalions with very good content. My only complaint is that the men of the battalions are listed by date of death rather than alphabetically (making it hard to find a particular person). It would also have been nice if he had listed all members of the battalions, not just the dead, especially as he refers to having access to such a database in the foreword."
3,GREAT STORIES-NEED FRIENDLIER FACES,"I certainly love the leapfrog line of stories, and felt a book on Bible stories would be perfect for my 3 1/2 year old. I have to admit, though, that my husband and I thought the illustrations were a bit on the scarier side. We're going to stick to the friendlier looking faces (same stories) in his other childrens Bible books for now."
3,Not for LeapPad Tablets,"I thought it would be great to have a bible game to go with the LeapPad2 tablets that we bought for our grandchildren. It does not fit. I got this from LeapFrog support:""You have purchase a cartridge which is for the LeapPad Learning Game System and it is not compatible with your unit. """
5,What a great book,"Straight from the typewriter of the Above to the playroom of your son, teach your children well with this fabulous book! My son is leapfrogging over all the pagans in his kindergarten class!"
3,Good for small shoes.,"I was pretty excited about this, it seems like a great idea. It would be best for kid's shoes or small women's shoes. I wear a size 8 1/2, which I don't consider to be huge, but some of my pairs didn't fit into these small pockets. Many of my shoes are rather clunky, like Dansko's and Doc's, so I really had to wrestle to get them in there, and gave up on a few, or had to split up pairs so each shoe had it's own slot. My closet is really small, and I ordered 2 of these, hoping to keep the floor a bit less cluttered. I think it'll help with that.Putting them together was kind of hard, too. We had a lot of trouble getting the wheels on."
4,for those who don't like Levine,"If you want the most student friendly book get Physical Chemistry , 4/e by Laidler, Meiser, Sanctuary, ISBN 061815292X.Description on their website says ""With its clear explanations and practical pedagogy, Physical Chemistry is less intimidating to students than other texts, without sacrificing the mathematical rigor and comprehensiveness necessary for a junior-level physical chemistry course. The text's long-standing reputation for accessible writing provides clear instruction and superior problem-solving support for students."" I second that.see my review herePhysical ChemistryI mention the alternatives as well."
1,Terrible semester,"Physical Chemistry is complicated, there is no way of getting around that. This book will go through the derivations, but never include units. That is a huge problem."
1,This book is awful,"This is a horrible book, possibly the worst Chemistry book I have ever had. The book is written in confusing, disconnected, language that is not geared toward the student, but rather to Levine's Ph.D collegues. Levine never gets to the point. Important concepts and ideas are drowned in needless jargon and text. I spent more time ""hunting"" for the important information rather than studying. In fact, there is so much useless material it is hard to distinguish the relevant from the irrelevant. It made for a very miserable Physical Chemistry course, and I actually learned more when I stopped reading the book and just worked a lot of problems. To any professors or students who are considering this book, I would recommend to stay far away from it, because it basically sucks."
5,Excellent! - The Other reviewers don't lie at all!,"I hear that there is a new edition... I know that it'll be just as good... Dr. Levine really presents everything in a very clear, well organized fashion... I particularly enjoy the entire section that deals with Stat. Mechanics towards the end... I must admit that the QM section is also brilliant... I think that last thing that really helps this book is the section that deals with Kinetic Molecular Theory, which is very sparsely dealt with in Atkins... I have to say that using this as a primary textbook and Atkins as a secondary textbook really presents all of the subject material. I really hope to met Dr. L someday... Perhaps he can autograph my well worn copy!!"
4,Graduate Level Book,"The physical chemistry text by Levine is a detailed text which I believe is best suited to the graduate student level. Someone who already has a basic understanding of physical chemistry, a solid calculus base, a course in matrix algebra, and a differential equations course can profit most from the detailed explainations in this book. This is especially true of the chapters on kinetic thermodynamics. Someone encountering physical chemistry for the first time may have a difficult time understanding the basics of the subject using this text."
2,disappointed,"I needed a pilates dvd to change up my work out routine. Though this dvd has many different workouts and is helpful to beginners and intermmediate, it is lacking in some aspects. The instructor (with Shelly) gets confused and forgets to mention important tips to keep from hurting yourself accidentally. The dvd goes in and out of the work out, such as going blank or focusing on some boat or the house behind them, instead of focusing on the pilates move being shown. There is also a lack of stretching before most of the workouts, which is terrible if you don't want to hurt yourself. When first showing the pilates move, the camera pans in to the work out instructors' faces instead of panning out to show the full move."
2,Stretching more than anything,"As the other review stated, zooming in and out on the faces (or other scenes) instead of showing the full body so that we can see what we should be doing. The entire collection is more stretching than anything and is so long (in length) that it gets frustrating. Thus far, I wish the producers had been more focused because I do not see a common goal in each segment.I like working out with the other lady in this DVD series rather than Shelly McDonald.In two sections of the DVD set, you need a Chi Ball and a Big Abs ball, which is not listed as needed items on the product."
1,Don't Waste Your Money!!,"I wish I had done my homework. This DVD is awful!! I agree with the others. The worst part is I couldn't get my money back because I had broke the seal! In CA, we are not allowed to return DVDs that have a broken seal. Maybe I can use it as a door stop."
1,Don't waste your money,I bought this dvd from Target since it was the only Pilates dvd they had and I've wanted to try Pilates. I thought that if it was run like any other basic workout dvd then I could deal with it. First of all the dvd starts out showing monkeys because they are in Barbados so of course the viewer wants to see the monkeys. The cameraman showed the monkeys so long that the women started their workout already with no instruction so once he did switch the view to them you had to catch up. There were several awkward cuts where the viewer could not see the moves exactly and the instruction was pretty poor overall. (I'm used to the Jillian Michaels dvds where she is always on point and always helping as well as motivating her viewers.) This dvd fell completely short of what I expected.
2,Too informal/unorganized,"It seems to be a very low budget series, the host often loses focus, jumbles her words and acts awkward. The video isn't very effective, as the camera crew will be zoomed in on faces, as opposed to the moves being instructed. The only plus is that it offers four different types of workout disks, but I truly cannot not recommend it for any viewers due to the poor quality."
2,Not Happy with DVD,"This DVD is lacking many things. In most of the workouts, Shelly isn't the instructor, her partner is. The camera keeps panning in and out of the workout so you can't see everything they are doing. There is more stretching than an actual workout. Shelly seems confused on some of the workouts and she tends to digress in many of the scenes. I was not happy with this DVD at all. All of the pictures on the DVD for each CD don't even apply to the type of workout you are doing. I wouldn't recommend this DVD to anyone. You are not getting what you see at all. If I could return this DVD from Target, I would, but unfortunately I don't think there are any stores that will take back a DVD if it's been open already. Do not by this DVD. I would even recommend a newbie to purchase this because you are not getting the workout you set out to get."
1,Awkward,"So disappointed with these dvds. The camera work is very random, doesn't stay on the instructor. The exercises aren't very challenging. There is no smooth flow from one exercise to the next. Don't waste your money"
2,This pilates workout is perfect...,"1) If you're psychic and can follow the absurd edits that jump from move to move with no warning.2) If you can see through time and space to overcome the camera being cropped on the instructors faces when you really need to see what their legs are doing.3) If you have $17 you desperately need to get rid of on something that you under no circumstances are allowed to enjoy.In all fairness, I liked the instructors. Their voices were soothing and they had a good repartee. But the workouts were incomprehensible, and they often ran out of time. So in the end, this isn't one I'll keep coming back to. (Sorry, instructors.)"
1,Terrible production,So disappointed in this DVD set. This must have been from a TV show because of all the breaks. There is little instruction and it just doesn't flow.
4,Essays on Color and on Warhol,"Hardly seems to have been written in 1968 (Year of publication) the writing still relevant. I especiallyappreciated the essays on Warhol and contemporary art in general, and the interview in which the author clarifies some of his most extreme published statements. (I've only read about half of this book so far)"
4,Good thriller,"I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 because of too much profanity, otherwise, it's a good thriller till the end. Bad guys were giving Bill Reed a lot of run around. Bad guys were bully around Reed's cousin, Johnny Boy (with Down's Syndrome) for no reason and it will make you feel like Johnny Boy is one of your own and wanting to protect him from bad people."
4,Reed's life turns upside down.,"Active man loses leg in motorcycle accident. During his convalescence, (and while he is feeling sorry for himself), he recieves a troubling communication from his cousin. Retarded, forty, and institutionalized, the cousin has worse problems than the pain of prosthesis. Thrilling, insightful, a newly handicapped man's struggle to overcome the evil in a closed world that has no compassion or respect for differences."
5,John - where are you?,"After reading And Justice For One, I read every book I could get my hands by J.C. I would rate them all 5 stars. I mean the books are page turning, can't put it down. I have shared them with friends who also agree. I am always on the look out for the next one. The only problem is that J.C's books are few and far between. I would love to know if anything is in the works for the near future. Again bravo for this author.Diane Brown"
4,Great fun with any barbie,"I only purchased this item due to the 4.99 price. I must admit when I opened the box I wanted to stuff it back in and say forget it, but that could have been due to the other 25 things I had already put together and was just tired.15 minutes later my 11 year old son had it complete and my daughters 6 & 10 were having a blast. I figured I would have to go out and buy them a couple of the mermaidia dolls to go with but that wasn't true. Any barbie works great.It came with a table, 2 chairs, one character, mirror, sink, comb, hammock, a flying flower, and a slide. The house itself is about 2 foot tall."
5,My daughter loves it,"We got this our 3 year old daughter for Christmas and she loves it. The whole thing just snaps together, which was nice. It seems very well made too. Ava's already dropped it a few times and we just snapped it right back together. She has some of the dolls that go wth it but her Polly Pockets work real well with it too. I would definitely recommend this toy."
5,One of their best,"I first heard of REZ (then Resurrection Band) when I was in my early 20's. I appreciated what they were trying to do (playing music with Christian themes in a rock format), but I considered them too juvenile for someone like me to take seriously.However, this is one band that has really grown on me in the last 30 years. Now that I am approaching fifty, I have come to realize they were far, far better than I gave them credit for. Not only do they seriously rock, but their lyrics reflect a depth of thought and insight that is rare for a band in any genre.I'd recommend Civil Rights as a must buy from this very underrated and unappreciated band. Also check out Awaiting Your Reply, Rainbows End, Silence Screams, Innocent Blood, Reach of Love, and, Lament. For that matter, just get all their albums. Everyone of them is a gem and well worth the money."
4,Solid album--could possibly be out of print soon?,"I just bought the Regain Records version of this album after owning the Candlelight-licensed one previously. This is perhaps Gaahl at his finest--Wound Upon Wound and Carving a Giant are undoubted highlights (only time I'd ever say Gaahl was better was on the song Destroyer, off the album of the same name). However, Regain was (and still is?) having finanical problems, and several higher profile bands, like Marduk, left the label. If Regain goes out of business, it could mean that this version could be a collector's item. In any event, the imprint this album has on black metal cannot be denied."
5,Mellencamp Changes it up....,"This CD is INCREDIBLE. I got it the day it came out and can't stand to turn it off! It's bluesy, jazz with John's mix of rock. A must have....."
5,Great CD!,This is excellent work by John and really showcases his diversity. Far superior to Cuttin' Heads and quite possibly the best of his career.
5,Super CD!,"This is my first John Mellencamp cd. I love this one. If you like bluesy/folksy music this cd delivers! I am now a new fan of John's music. I hope he gives us more music just like this. I love Lafayette with Lucinda Williams. She is one of my favorite artists and they sounded super together. Keep up the good work, John!"
3,Mellencamp gets back on track,"Following a series of disappointing albums, Mr Mellencamp releases an album I want to listen to more than a few times. Along with ""Big Daddy"" this is one of his career hi-lites. It is a real shame he did not do a small scale tour featuring this material. If anyone is not familiar with most of the original songs I urge them to investigate the original artists such as Son House. If your stictly a fan of radio friendly Mellencamp avoid this release. However, if you find merit in the less commercial and authentic side of Mellencamp, you'll enjoy."
5,AWESOME!!!,"This is a CD that you won't be able to sit still while listening to it. My foot was tapping, my head was bobbing and I wanted to just get up and dance around. Mellencamp sounds amazing, I want to just keep playing it over and over. For a Mellencamp fan this one is a must."
5,Classics redone--in such a great way.,"Death Letter--originally a Son House track, is by itself, worth the cost of this album. The others who have reviewed this have done a great job so no point covering that ground. Great Album!"
1,I got sucked in again,"I want my money back. After two listens I am not sure if I can give this disc away. This is the exact same way I felt after buying Cuttin Heads. I always thought buying a JCM disc was a no brainer, now I feel not buying it is the real no brainer."
1,John-Remember when you could ROCK?,"Too old to rock-n-roll and too young to die should have been this sorry cd's title. I felt ripped off when I bought ""cuttin heads"" but with this one I feel like I got mugged. This sorry excuse for an album could be worse. He could start singing nursery rhymes, or maybe talking in tongues. Which is O.K. if thats what ya gotta do. But brother, quit taking my money. Maybe its time to go away. (quietly). But please, no more garbage."
1,Poor Johnny Cougar,Little Johnny does not like The America's policy in Iraq. He makes it abundantly clear in this cd. Then again Johnny is not to bright. He still smokes after having a Heart attack.
4,Eclectic Bluesy Mix,"When the band breaks into the first tune - Robert Johnson's ""Stones in My Passsway"", the stage is set. What follows is an incredible mix of American roots music, from Delta blues to folk with a bunch of tunes that are hard to pigeonhole. But I think that the key is that the music is delivered with passion and a love for the genre. I wonder what Son House would have thought if he heard this version of his classic ""Death Letter""? I think he would have liked it. Another standout is Willie Dixon's ""Down in the Bottom"". John sings like he knows how to fight out of a tough spot as the band rocks along on this classic. Excellent covers of a bunch of great tunes. Mellencamp's best album in quite some time."
1,Pop not roots,"Mellencamp advertised this cd to be roots music,well it's not.I read where he was gonna play blues the way it should be played.He should stick to pop music because he doesn't know the first thing about playing the blues.And to top it off he finishes with an anti-war song.Blues is American music and Americans fight for freedom.This cd is HORRIBLE!!"
5,"One of the Best - Rock, Folk, Blues... One of the Best","I am 52 years old and still love my Stones, Dylan, Clapton, Yardbirds, Dwight, and others. I am stumbled upon this album today and even on the first listen, I was blown away. Talk about a national treasure... and one that rocks."
1,under-sized for 6x9 speakers,"midrange mud is over-accentuated (like listening to someone talk loudly when his hand is cupped over his mouth). no noticeable improvement in lower frequencies. no port - speakers are choked. even cutting my eq in the relevant range doesn't help much. upon further research, it seems that a box for a 6x9 should be about twice as big as this box, and have a port. not a big money loss for trying these out, but i will know better next time."
5,Better than I expected,"I love Inu-Yasha & really feel that work is the best by the author, but having bought Seasons 3 & 4 of the Ranma Anime, I decided to try the manga. A very pleasant shock as I was expecting the vain, rude Ranma from the anime, but Ranma's sweeter in the first 3 volumes I've read. The 1st 2 eps of the anime are pretty faithful to the manga. Very funny & worth the time."
5,Ranma 1/2 is a very kawaii book!,This is another one of my favorites! It's about a boy named Ranma who turns into a girl when he gets spashed with cold water!! It's a funny manga also! Highly recommended!
5,I love Ranma 1/2!!,"I love ranma 1/2!! Thank you Rumiko for creating Ranma 1/2! So far I have vols. 1 and 11 and im planning on getting 2 and 3. My fav scene in Vol. 1 is when Akane steps into the bathroom and spots a naked boy! And my fav scene in Vol. 11 is when...um...well, I liked all the scenes!"
5,This book is soooo funny!,"I really loved Ranma 1/2. Ranma is a disgruntled teenager, his life completely changed by the fact that when doused in cold water, he becomes a girl! Not only does this cause problems with his father, who turns into a panda, but also with his social life. He's engaged to a man-hating girl named Akane, who seemingly wants nothing to do with him and is called 'Tree-born kettle girl' or 'Beautiful Pig-tailed Goddess' by the Blue Thunder of Furikan High, Kuno. This book is full of hilarious spats between Ranma and Akane, Ranma and his father, Ranma and Kuno... get the picture? I highly recomend this book to anyone who enjoys humor and out-of-the-ordinary plots."
5,Awesome!!!!!!!!!!!,This is the best book in the Forbidden doors series. It teaches you not to believe what you see all the time. The other books all have lessons behind them too but the main message is trust in God!
4,Well Worth Having,"The layout of this book suggests that it began as a campaign biography and that, after Garfield's death, the author and publisher brought it out again with chapters added about Garfield's presidency, shooting, decline and death; and extensive coverage of the nation's mourning. It is thus entirely pro-Garfield, and laid on pretty thick. Not for the political scientist, historian or serious student.Still, you can learn a lot about someone from their friends; and you'll come away from this book knowing Garfield as more than a name on the list of Presidents. The price is a bargain; and the book is arguably in better condition at 126 than I am at half that age."
4,photo print,"received in timely manor,was not used,was not aware that was not current edition of printing suite...still able to use; packing was adequate and no damage was done to product"
4,Good program,Great program. Very easy to navigate with good basic editting tools. Great program for beginners.
5,Easily the best CD I own!,It is quite seldom that one finds classical saxophone music today and this CD is an absolute gem. This is probably what Adolphe Sax had in mind when he developed the instrument. The worlds most beautiful music performed exquisitly.
5,Great stuff,this shampoo gets that hair smelling good and the conditioner follows up by getting it soft as silk
5,Blume classic,"I remember reading the Fudge books which starred Peter Hatcher, and in these books we sometimes saw Sheila Tubman. You could see this book as an offshoot of the world created in the Fudge series, since the story focuses on Sheila. There's actually several Sheila books, and I recommend all of them."
4,"Good Story, Unlikeable Protagonist","Judy Blume has the ability to write a brilliant story even when her protagonist is portrayed in an unfavourable light. In this story, she does just that. Sheila Tubman is a complaining annoying girl who is scared of everything. She even admits to herself ""Sometimes I think I am two people. I am the only one who knows 'sheila tubman'. Everyone else knows SHEILA THE GREAT'."" She finds a role model and best friend on her holiday in Tarrytown, 'Mouse', a fearless girl who easily sees the personality traits that Sheila tries to hide.Well, all I have to say, is that you should read the book."
3,Not the same book you read as a kid,"We borrowed this book from the library after we read a couple of the Fudge books that we had on the shelf at home. I was surprised that the text now refers to a CD player and personal computers used by children, even though neither existed at the time the book was written. I found the changes jarring and wondered what else had been changed in the book that wasn't so obvious.As an adult, I was disturbed by how casually the subject of friends being mean (or at least brutally honest) to one another is treated in the book. I don't remember it bothering me when I first read the book, though, some 30 years ago, and it didn't seem to bother my daughter when we read it, though we did stop to discuss how the friends could have been more kind."
5,the most Fabulous and Funny book in my life,when my mommy read me this book i just loved it and i got in to a phase of reading it two times every day!! i really love this book beacause there is this girl sheila who does not want to say that she cant swim and is afraid of the dark dogs and spiders then on her summer vacation she meets some kids who make her admitt that she is not such a supergirl as she says she is. this book is the best book ever and if you like funny books and have not read this one READ IT NOW!!!!!!!!
5,Epic,I loved this book. It was awesome. I recommend this book to kids all ages. Best book ever. I love it.
3,Sheila has an advanture,This story takes place in summer vacation in Tarrytown because they didn't want to go to Disney land.This book is mostly about Libby how thinks she is good at dancing like a ballerina but she's not. Sheila is the small one she wanted to go to Disney land and Mouse is a girl how is friends with Sheila.It's about a journey to Tarrytown they stay in a apartment for vacations and Sheila has friends and she does some stuff with her friends.When Sheila's friends want revenge from Libby because she told her mother that they were throwing the airplane models and they threw one to Libby's friend.In my opinion It's great because Sheila has friends and they do something to Libby and her friend.
3,Shiela is not as funny as Peter & Fudge,"After reading Tales of a Fourth Grade Nothing and Superfudge, I checked this book out of the library expecting more of the same. Unfortunately, we did not enjoy this book nearly as much. In Otherwise Known as Shiela the Great, Judy Blume departs from Peter's sympathetic viewpoint to give us a closer look at Shiela. She is the kind of kid that is difficult to like. As an example, she is afraid of dogs but won't admit it. So she tells Peter that she doesn't want to ride in the elevator with him because his dog smells bad. Sheila is hurtful to others because she lacks self-esteem. My daughters (ages 8 and 9) could not get past Shiela's unpleasant personality and we never finished the book. It may be that at this age children are looking for main characters that they like and can identify with, and they could not relate to Sheila."
2,Otherwise Known as Sheila the Great,"I give this book 5 stars! Sheila is funny, and it goes through a great story line! This book is otherwise known as great!"
3,Nilsson & Tipton were a fab combination,"I can vouch for Greg Cleary's opinion of SKIDOO. It's utter crap. With the stunning exception of I CAN TAKE YOU THERE, which benefits enormously from George Tipton's brilliant orchestration. Tipton's harpsichord usage is far superior to, say, Brian Wilson's harpsichord usage in CAROLINE NO."
2,BE VERY CAREFUL before buying,"Be careful. I've spent 4 hours in 'live chat' with their technical support to make this thing work. And it won't do what I need it to do. First, be careful -- it must be plugged directly into the wall socket(it won't work plugged into a power strip) and it needs a main USB port in the back of your computer unit (front, side, or alternate USB ports won't work -- less power to alternate USB ports they said). And the you have to download a 'PRO' version of the software hidden on their website in order to back-up your entire computer system. Be careful of folders within folders. Selecting individual files is very cumbersome and doesn't always capture the folders within folders. And, if you need to back-up another computer across a network -- this won't do it. According to Iomega tech support, Iomega doesn't have any product that backs up another computer over a network. Be careful. This is accurate -- but other printed things by Iomega don't pan out."
3,3 1/2 Star,"The plastic is on the light side, 50 cents more plastic would make a big difference.The holes on the bin don't all line up with template enclosed.Using the template, drive small nails in the wall. Hang the bin to see if the nails areall centered and touching the top of the key hole, adjust if nessary.Take the nails out and install screws.It holds about 30 lbs. of dog food, I thought it would hold more.You lose a couple pieces of dog food when closing.I got mine at Lion Country Supply."
5,This CD will not play in a CD-ROM or DVD/CD player.,"You get 5 verions of ""The Chase"": the single, an instrumental, an extended version, and 2 remixes. Be aware that this CD uses copy protection that prevents it from playing it in a computer."
5,hmiddle,These shoes are awesome! They had the tie up Madison look although they are a slip on. If you like Stacy Adams shoes then these are the shoes for you.
3,So and So,"I was disappointed that James Brown only performs 5 songs from this concert. That's the end of the DVD. Initially, before I purchased it, I was unaware of that fact, neither does the seller mentions that fact. Picture and sound are very good."
2,"Good idea, but not very durable","After only three uses, the card holder started to come apart. It was not roughly handled or played with, either. I would rate it much higher if it stayed together better."
4,Great for little hands!,"I bought these for my sons for Christmas. We love to play cards games together, but my 7 year old has a hard time holding and sorting the cards. This makes it so much easier on him and now he has more fun playing cards with us. I bought two of them, and even my 12 year old like using it. These are made of very thin plastic and cardboard, so may wear out if used roughly. However, if they are only used for playing cards and put away when finished, I think they will last quite a while."
4,decent product,"I bought this for my 6 and 4 year olds who are really into UNO. They both were having a hard time holding cards, esp the 4 year old. This product helped immensely. The one challenge they needed to overcome was that when they took out 1 card, others that were touching it came out too."
5,Fantastic tool to help little hands hold cards,Our 4-year-old was having so much trouble during family games holding his cards orderly and keeping other players from cheating by viewing his cards. It was making him very frustrated. This worked like a charm and made it much easier for him to play and win. We highly recommend it.
5,Love this!,I purchased this card holder for my 3 year old son about 6 months ago and we love it! It has made playing card games with him so much easier. I would definitely recommend this for all small hands who love to play cards!
5,Great Tool for Little Hands,"Before I purchased this card holder my son would splay his cards out on the table for everyone to see. Not fun for my son, but fun for the rest of the family! Now we cannot see my son's cards anymore, which makes him happy."
4,REALLY LIKED THIS,This is the second book in the Burnett Bride series. I really enjoyed reading and this book kept me awake until finished. Easy reading. I will look for other books by this author.
3,Interesting,I found this a decent read and interesting although some of the things were rather repetitive. But I do enjoy a hero who goes out of his way to help a damsel in distress even if he knows its not a good idea. Worth reading but could have been better.
2,Too repetative,"Too may pages on the love scene - I don't need to read about that and the reasons why the 2 main characters shouldnt be together was repeated over and over throughout the book. I enjoyed Book 1, but this and book 3 - don't bother."
1,bad read,Msybe I was wrong but I thought that humor was to be funny but this is so dry as to be unfunny. I only read the first four stories then gave up.
1,Disappointed to say the least,"Wow, this product should not be put out. Less than Blu-ray quality would be forgivable if the product was actually done right. Instead disc two has the menu bar up the whole time. That is is the biggest of numerous problems with the this three disc set. Audio is wrong. The third disc is about the the Atlantic- why? this is titled the Pacific Campaign, why have a whole disc on the Atlantic. This product is terrible and should not have been released on the Blu-ray format."
1,Soundtrack issues,Totally unacceptable. Where is the quality control and attention to detail? As the other reviewers stated the Burma episode has the wrong soundtrack :( Why is Amazon still selling this product?
1,Big problem with disks needs to be pulled,"Show is good of what I could watch. The last episode of the 1st disk had the TOTAL WRONG audio, audio was about Britian vs Itallian forces on Crete, video was what it was suppose to be the Pacific war. 2nd disk clicked ""play all"" it starts up and video playing and audio BUT there is a menu bar across the bottom of the screen saying ""main menu and episode selection"", skipped forword still there.Of what I watched it was very educational and well done, that gets 5 stars.So back it goes. :("
1,Severe technical problems,I was looking forward to this set of DVDs but after watching the first disk I have to agree with the other reviewers. The last episode on the first disk has the audio for the battle of Crete but the video is about the Burma campaign which is what the listed episode is about. Totally unacceptable. The most of basic application of quality control should have caught this error. I am now reluctant to even bother with the remaining two discs. I can see why the price is so low on this product. It could have been a great set to add to my collection of war DVDs but I am now considering sending the product back to Amazon. Very disappointed.
3,It's a shame,"As others have said ""Burma"" episode has ""CRETE"" soundtrack. Disk 2 the menu bar stays on screen during playback. The footage is real good and if not for those problems this would be an excellent set."
5,What it's like to be treated as on outsider,This story gives you an inside look of what it's like to be treated as an outsider. And why some youth become angry and sullen. With good cause. What a great read.
3,Cool but questionable design,"The ISS set is an interesting one, and is fun to assemble. It is not without its problems, however, as the final set's base is wholly inadequate and there are 30 stickers. The stickers are kinda cool looking, but seem likely to peel with age. The base can be suplemented with a wide flat black piece (12x12, 16x16, etc), but other weak points in the set make it much more a model than a toy.The miniature model of Space Shuttle Endeavour is much more durable, but the stickers on the side cover multiple pieces, limiting their utility for other uses and rebuilding the set. There are duplicates of both the multiple block stickers, so the shuttle can be rebuilt once (but only once)."
1,Outrageous Price,"This was quite a disappointment. It is much smaller than I expected. Given the high price tag, I expected a large set, similar to others I'd seen in the retail stores. The box is only about 9 inches square, and it took my son less than an hour to build it. I'm normally a fan of Lego products, but I give this one star because of the price tag. At 75 cents per each small piece of molded plastic, it is not a good value. If you want to give your child a model of the space station, I'm sure that there are better options."
4,REALLY FUN,"Though a little short (30 minutes), this was a great experience. I remember seeing a few of these commmercials myself, and I was glad that someone took the time to keep them, find them, and transfer them to Video."
2,Has spots on it.,I'm disappointed because it supposed be a house warming gift and I couldn't give it because has a spots on it and looks like previously used or stored wrong.
2,Probably TOO easy for most people,"As puzzles go, this one is about as easy as it gets. Most people will get it within a few minutes. And it's one of those puzzles that you can pretty much do once and then it's no fun anymore. But it's not a terrible puzzle, and it's only $5. So it might be good for a little kid because it's something they could figure out. But the average teen or adult will probably be better of saving their $5 and buying a more difficult puzzle that will challenge them a bit more."
4,NICE TOOOL,"This tool is a must for working on CIS fuel injection systems. It is easy to use. However, it could use longer hoses so that you can be in the car and watch the gauge as you crank and start the enguine. Otherwise, works great and not a bad price."
1,Not worth the price.,"For the price...this kit may do the job, but imho is not worth the price. Fittings are very limited, the guage lens is made of plastic with a purge valve next to the guage. Fuel can easily get on the lens and begin to melt away the lens making it unreadable. I had another kit, a complete set sold by harbor freight, that was much higher quality although difficult to use with the CIS system because it had pressure valves in all the connections. As well, the kit I received appeared used or returned previously."
2,Quality,"I just received my copy of the DVD and as a fan of Scrooge I was so looking forward to seeing this version. The story, cast, and music are just wonderful. However, the quality of the audio (which takes so much away from the songs) and video are at best mediocre. For those of you who consider themselves audiophiles I would think twice before purchasing this DVD; for the rest of us the quality of the DVD is live-able but just barely."
5,An Oldie but Goodie,"Let me start by saying I am a huge fan of A Christmas Carol. I have purchased many versions over the years and to find a new one is a rare gift. That being said, I would have to say that this version is not the best of the Christmas Carol stories, but It is quite good. Especially for its age and that it was taped live. I think Basil is a good Scrooge but he is not great. And when he sings Humbug, he is not in sync with the orchestra. I found the book to be the weak, but the score is amazing. The performances by Vic Damone, Johnny Desmond, Patrice Munsel and Robert Weede are worth the purchase and the reason I gave the review five stars. After watching this version I purchased the soundtrack on itunes. It is a treat to watch. Happy Holidays!"
2,"OK, but not memorable","Bought this because I love A Christmas Carol and Basil Rathbone, but this musical was a disappointment. Singing was nice, but it hindered the storyline causing important scenes to be left out. The cover shows a dark haired Basil Scrooge, but in the show, Scrooge is white haired. The ghost of Christmas past and present are too similar, bearded long haired men. Belle is a great singer, but too old for this role, she looks like she's in her 30s. Several scenes are devoted to Martha and her singing to Tiny Tim, no other Christmas Carol favored Martha this way and this was a waste, would have preferred more scene time with Mrs Cratchit. Bob Cratchit was uninteresting, won't be watching this again, too painful to see A Christmas Carol muddled this way..."
1,Amazing Flavor!!!!!,"I have been a trident chewer for about a year now and have tried all of the flavors. Of all the flavors, this one is the best in my opinion. I definitely recommend buying this gum."
5,Cool combo,"This guy has got some serious powers. I'm not joking. He is one of my top 5 for using peices for combo's. His mask looks really cool, and his feet make him look like he's crawling. This is worth the price. ReMeMbEr, ThIs CrEaTuRe Is GoOd FoR cOmBoS."
4,Robot toys for Robot boys,I used to play with Bionicles a lot. I think had this when I was a kid. It might still be in my old room. Maybe.
5,I am so excited about this product!,I bought this product after seeing it on Amazon. I have tried it in two recipes. It substitutes just like flour. I made the best banana nut bread with it! It is awesome to be able to use a regular recipe without any special instructions and come up with something so good to eat but gluten free. No need to feel deprived! I am anxious to try it in some other recipes.
4,Great product,"This is a great substitute for wheat flour. Everything I have baked with this flour has turned out great. The flavor is all there, no funny aftertaste. The only thing that bothered me was that there wasn't enough 'rise'. Everything turned out a little flat, not very pretty to look at. But what can you do? At least the taste was all there."
2,"Sorry, not thrilled.","I was looking for a wheat free flour substitute, and the ad said this was a direct replacement for conventional flour. I also am supposed to stay away from yeast, and this uses a different rising agent. I thought I was set. Well, not so much. This stuff failed in 2 bread recipes, and made paste in a pizza dough recipe. Adding egg to it helped, but I never could get a result that would make me try this again."
4,In Defense of Globalization....the WTO?,"Ignore the previous ""review"" which clearly didn't read the book (nor even read its synopsis) because the author is claiming that the WTO and free trade will help more than hurt. I'm planning on using this for a class precisely because it provides a balanced approach to the WTO talking of its deficits and credits, while eventually arguing that, with modification, it can be beneficial to everyone. I'm not sure I agree but it is a good book, clear and reasonable...unlike so many out there on the WTO!"
1,Going To Pieces:The Rise and fall of the Slasher Film.,"Documentary starts great and covers alot of ground,covers movies I care about and others I don't. then it kills it by saying :""80's era of Reagan Greed""?! WTF?! why do I have to buy the same spoon fed lies? and then ""corporate America"" ? huh if your a film maker and your dealing with a studio that makes you part of ""Corporate America"" too.I don't care what John Carpenter thinks(didn't he get away with Murder? by his connection with The Hogan's Heroes guy?)the documentary should keep it's opinion not FACTS to itself. other than that.......The only Genre Movies that Matter : Halloween,Fridaythe13th, Nightmare 1 and 2, everything after doesn't matter or make sense at least to me."
5,Coolio!,"This doll is so cool!I used to hate Bratz,But now i love them!Eiter,Boys,or girls I still love them!This doll has 2 shirts and a pair of pants,and a watch,necklace,and a bracelet.I would think you would love this toy!Enjoy here on Amazon.com!"
5,Bratz Cameron Rules!!,My brother Zachary bought it and we play together all the time. We love Bratz!
4,Don't waste $,"Ya know the way Cameron has progressed at first he was sort of grungey then he was preppythen mock-hard-core,If I were you I'd buy the Tokyo Cammeron."
2,Although,Although this dolls is ugly that's what makes him more fun to play with. My opinion is but a Dylan you'll like him better.
5,It's Hard to Be Five,I purchased this book for my grandson's five birthday. He loves it and it is so true. We talked about learning to control your own buttons on your control panel as you grow up.He is now reading it to me.
5,IT 'S HARD TO BE FIVE....,"Learning how to work my control panel is a really great book! Thank you Jamie Lee Curtis! Humor with some great lessons.... We need more children's books from someone ""who get't it""."
1,Parents Beware,"I did not even get so far as READING this book. As a parent trying to see through my kids eyes I did the first thing a kid at this age reading level would do. I looked at the pictures first. We have a boy playing in the dirt NAKED burying his little brother up to his chin, a little boy lying on his back NAKED with his private part covered by an exclamation point from the text, and a little girl holding the front of her dress up for the 5 year old reader to view her girly little underpants. How is this book appropriate?? This was a book my kindergarten child checked out from his school library. I sent it back post hast. If I ever see this book come home again it will not be returning to the library. It will go straight in the trash."
4,Good reading for teachers and parents,"As a new kindergarten teacher who'd taught second and first for three years running, I was really having a hard time understanding the minds of my new students. This book, told from the kids' perspectives, was a godsend.Jamie Lee Curtis does a great job in getting down how kids talk and think. The art work also adds to the story.Early in the year, when my students were having a hard time sitting still and learning to focus, I read this to them. It really clicked with them and helped them see that other 5 year olds felt the same."
2,Not crazy about it,"I was so excited when I found out that Jamie Lee was coming out with a new book, but I have to say that I'm a little disappointed. We have all the other books and I LOVE them! However, I felt this one was not as well written as the others. Not that the idea wasn't good. It's a great topic and I do like several phrases in the book, but it just doesn't flow very well. There are some sentences that just don't sound quite right and they don't read well. I think she could've done a better job and I'm not recommending this book. But...if you don't have the others, I highly recommend those! They are some of my favorite books to read to my three children."
5,"Lovely, lovely little book","This book deals with issues that adults may not always be aware of or remember. It will surely bring smiles, laughter and comfort for you and your child."
1,good thing she had a partner in writing this....,"so she could blame it's failure on the other person. Meh...maybe it's appealing to the activia yogurt set, but I sea another reviewer referenced Ms. Curtis' chronological and familial disconnect with the typical 4-5 year old. She certainly didn't resonate with mine."
1,Really out of touch,This book is terrible. Introduced concepts most 5 year olds have never heard of. 5 is a wonderful age full of new adventures and discoveries...no mention in the book.
2,Instructions/parts not correct,The instructions at one point tell you to glue a part onto a non-existent attribute of the plane. It appeared to me that this was a basic C-130 model that they modified to a gunship model. The modification was not all that successful.
4,Batman in Egypt as a detective not a super hero,"i got this and it's other part for the obvious reasons that it is Batman as a detective and set in Egypt with mummies in a tomb. i love Egyptian art and artifacts and an Egyptian murder mystery is something that i buy all the time, in the paperback mystery section at my used book store. i have always preferred Batman as a detective and not a super hero. he doesn't have super powers, what he has is well trained body and a keen mind for solving problems. this is how he was written in the 70s by Dennis O'Neil and Neal Adams. this book or books are newer than the 70s but it has that feel to the story. but i haven't finished them yet so we will see if the final of the story stacks up to say a Ra's al Ghul mystery. the art work is good on the Egyptian things so i am not yet complaining. Nekhrun the Bat-god is the villain, all right."
2,not enough,"i bought the book when i bought the car, a 73 targa , and although the book covers some things , it's just not enoughit tells you a couple of things about buying one, enough to start thinking about it, but it isn't enough to be your main source of porsche knowledge, it's to average, and the pictures are just to dark and undetailedthe engine revision part is next to useless as it barely covers engine teardown , and doesn't cover the world of differences in types and models of 911 enginesfor DIY , 101 projects for your 911 , for engine DIY , How to rebuild your 911 engine , both from Wayne Dempsey are more valuable, and indeed a must have...this one just isn'tand no , i'm not a kid, i'm just lazy and didn't feel like filling in forms and stuff"
3,Not Quite as Advertised,"This book was advertised to also cover the 1976 Porsche 912E. While it does cover the chassis, the transmission, and part of the electrical circuits and features, it falls incomplete on any engine-related work. It is not as thorough as it needs to be on many of the details, but the price is very reasonable. There is another book available many places that covers specific details about these cars (1974 - 1989), and together they're worth the total cost of both (approximately $50)."
1,Bummer,Product did not work. Second time I have submitted a response and no one has contactd me with a resolution. Guess I am just stuck with a faulty product.
3,A dissertation,"Most interesting topic, and there is much to be learned from all the information contained in the book. It is well researched and documented, because it is a PhD disseration. If you are a scholar interested in this topic, this book is highly recommended. For others, I'd still recommend it, although not as enthusiastically."
5,Best seasoning salt,"I don't add any purchased salad dressings. Being Greek I follow the greek style salad dressing: olive oil, lemon, salt and herbs in all my salads, not only in the greek salad. I was using fresh and/or dry herbs. And when I found this Herbamare salt I loved it. It has all of the herbs I was adding to my salad, but additional ones that taste great in salads.You can also add it to your rice, to your vegetables, to your meats, etc, etc. It gives a great, light, pleasant flavor to everything you add it on. It doesn't have an overwhelming taste.Everybody that tastes my salads loves them and asks me how I make them. I tell them the secret is the salad dressing. The simpler and most natural the better. I tell them about my Herbamare and now they are all buying it for their salads. And of course, I keep buying.The best part I like about this product: it is organic!!!!"
5,Herbamare,"I have used this product for several years and would recommend it to anyone. It can be used during cooking or shaken directly on salads, eggs, and many other dishes. yummie!!!"
4,"http://www.Watching Hannah: Sex, Horror and Bodily De-Formation in Victamazon.com/gp/product/1861891199/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title",Excellent book on the condition of women in victorian times.The title is a bit off putting but the book is actually very interesting.The pictures are also a real insight to the times.
3,Overdone subject,This is basically a study of scientist in Germany both in WW1 and in particular WW2 who faced a moral issue of their work and morality. I found the studies here being quite ordinary. Nothing particularly new.Towards the end I started to feel that the scope of the book is too narrow as this problem is not just one of scientist in a period of war but anyone who is a citizen of a country has to face a question of his own personal morality and the job he does.
2,mediocre is an extreme exaggeration,"wow. I have fallen asleep numerous times in the midst of reading this book, and don't say it's because i'm old. I'm 14. This book does have some interesting tidbits, but i found that this book was less about how german science was used in the war and more about what germany did DURING the war. no one cars about synthetic dyes!"
5,Worth reading again and again,Unbelievably entertaining. I recommend this to any friend with a joy for tongue-in-cheek humor. I enjoyed the absurd coincidences and irreverent look at the things we wll take too seriously. I've read it half a dozen times and will read it again when I need to put things back in perspective.
4,Earthworm Jim Is The BEST Game Boy Game EVER!!!,"This game is an update to the classic SNES version, and it's very well done. The graphics are good, the sound is nice and the environments are nicely polished. But the backgrounds don't move and the animation is slightly choppy. But other than that, the game is great! It's a little too cartoony for my taste but I still enjoy it! Buy this game, you won't regret it!!!"
4,Exactly like SNES EJ,"Like others have said, this is a genuinely classic game. It's been ported perfectly to the GBA. The dark colors used are definitely a problem, even under ideal GBA-playing lighting conditions. As soon as someone comes out with a true backlight modification kit for GBA, this game will be the best in the GBA catalog!"
2,Cannot Understand,"When I borrowed this game, I didn't understand it at all. I suggest you spend your money on Rayman Advanced or F-Zero Maximum Velocity."
2,no title,This game is kind of fun but it has no saving on it so you have to start over every time you turn it off. the colors are very dark and he shoots some () plasma instead of smacking or something.
2,Great Game Gone To Waste!!,"This is a very good game exept for two Huge Problems!!! This game doesn't have a save feature, so the first levels get very BOORRING!!! So unless you cheat you wont get to the end. The graphics are horrible! You need to be in perfect lighting to see some of the stuff in this game. Other than that i think you should get this game. (yeah right)"
5,I own the SNES version and....,"this is better. The graphics are better and the game itself is awsome. The best part of this game, I think, is when you fire 20 rounds of bullets into a little crow and see the bird explode into a cloud of feathers... very funny....This game will appeal to almost anyone. Try it!"
4,Earthworm Jim,"I love this game, and since I recently lost my DS Lite with Earthworm Jim in it, I HAD to replace it. The ONLY downside that this, GBA version, has EVER had is that it has no save points. All in all, great price, fast delivery, and the game was in great condition."
2,Not Worth It,"This game might be fun if you could save. Not being able to save in a game is a quite an annoyance, the first couple levels get boring. Also, this game doesn't have a real good fun aspect. The only reason I'm awarding it with two stars is because of the nice graphics and sound."
4,This sucker sure is interesting.,"This has to be one of the most original platform games ever created. I was a big fan of the Sega Genesis version back in the day and this port does not disappoint. Aside from the lack of brightness on the screen, this is a must have GBA title."
4,"Good, but bad!!",I am thirteen and I have this game. It is my first game and I was hoping you wouldn't have to find a perfect spot of lighting in the car. It is really dark. And there is no SAVING!!! Other than that it is fun and challenging. I am stuck on the Fifth Level.
5,The Best,I own this game for all of the systems relesed the super NES Sega genisis and PC and the grapics are awsome sound is great!
3,Low signal to noise at low volume levels,"I have used both the Pyle PYD1938 & Gemini PMD-01.Pros of Pyle PYD1938:-Longer equalizer bars-Secondary gain adjustment knob-Fancy LED lightingPros of Gemini PMD-01:-Better specification overall--http://www.pyleaudio.com/manuals/PYD1938.pdf--http://www.geminidj.com/product_manuals/pdm_man.pdf-Equalizer on/off switch-Ground isolation switchThe Gemini PMD-01 has better signal to noise specs. When using Sony MDR-7508 headphones in a quiet room, I would have to turn the volume too high to stop hearing the noise the mixer was generating. The solution was to add series resistors to the head phone jack to use higher volume levels without causing hearing loss."
2,"Better than nothing, but not the best","When we first found out our daughter had multiple food allergies we bought this book after getting tons of great info from FAAN. (FAAN is a wonderful resource, everyone dealing with food allergies should join.)Unfortunately, I think that this cookbook leaves a lot to be desired. We found ourselves disappointed by many of the recipes we tried in here; particularly, the wheat-free recipes often came out with very poor texture.For baked goods and especially desserts, I'd recommend Cindy Moseley's ""Great Foods Without Worry"" over this one. We also routinely use some of the recipes from the ""Gluten Free Gourmet"". This might be a good third or fourth book if you're looking for more ideas."
2,Not for corn allergics,"This book has many good recipes, but it does not include any info about corn allergy. And, many of the recipes contain ingredients that are sources of hidden corn. This would not be a good cookbook for anyone that has been recently diagnosed with corn allergy. But recipes can be adapted to be corn-free, by people who know how to do it. Some recipes call for ingredients that contain sulfites. So people who are sulfite sensitive should use caution, too."
4,The Food Allergy News Cookbook,"This is just a great book for any person with almost any food allergy. I thought my son would never be able to eat ice cream, being allergic to eggs, but they have a recipe for that too! It is a real life saver! It has main dishes to dessert, a must for anyone dealing with food allergies!"
1,Lacks variety,"I was looking for a real cookbook with a VARIETY of ideas including NEW meal ideas. The back of the book states ""A full range of menu ideas . . ."" Not true. Of the 300 recipes in the book, about 250 are for cookies, cakes, pies, sweet breads, muffins and other dessert type items. There are only 50 recipes in the ""Main Meals"" chapter and it looks like they were stretching to fill the chapter. About 10 of the recipes in ""Main Meals"" are made of potatoes such as ""Potato Fans"": slice a potato, sprinkle with salt and bake. Wow. I can barely contain myself. Four of the recipes were for more breads like corn bread and then the all-to-creative Chicken & Rice and Pizza --which is what I'm trying to get away from. I wanted was some NEW creative ideas for meals or side dishes. I will keep looking for a better book."
5,nice selection of recipes,"Easy to make recipes and a wide selection. So far, every recipe I've tried has been good. As with any allergy cook book, there will be recipes using an item you may have an allergy to. In some cases they give substitutions for various ingredients to a particular recipe."
1,"***Beautiful, Inexpensive but Poor Quality***","Really beautiful ring for the price. The stones could never be mistaken for diamonds, but are nice in their own right. Two of the stones fell off of the first ring I ordered; ""Something Silver"" promptly issued me another one free of charge however. Ring feels sturdy, and the fit is comfortable. Very nice overall. ***Update: The stones soon fell out of the second ring issued as well. I didn't wear the ring everyday, or in the shower, or while hand washing. Not recommended, even for the low price."
2,Something best seen in a tabloid...,"This book strains the limits of even a believer's open-mindedness, filled with outrageous claims of temporal displacement, directed reincarnation, teleportation, Martian slave camps...the list goes on and on. I would estimate that 80% of this book is pure--albeit poorly thought out--fantasy, while the remaining 20% is remotely possible. Did the United States military secretly experiment with mind-altering EM pulses emitted from a radar installation on Montauk Point? It's possible (Dr. Michael A. Percinger of Laurentian University has proved the concept in a lab environment)...but time tunnels, psychically created monsters, spontaneously materializing buildings?Please.Books like this give legitimate UFO, psychic, and conspiracy researchers a bad name. Save your money and look elsewhere."
1,Factual errors contained in this book,"This book is a complete fantasy. Without wasting any more time writing a review, I'd like to point of one huge error of fact contained in this book. In Chapter 10, pg. 65, the author claims that ""In the 1950's, ITT developed sensor technology that could literally display what a person was thinking."" Later on this same page and on page 67, he claims that a Cray 1 computer was used ""...interfaced with an IBM 360..."". The problem here was that the IBM 360 was introduced in 1964 and the Cray 1 was not introduced until 1976, so having this ""developed technology"" in the 1950s as described was impossible."
3,An Interesting Read to Say the Least...,"It was certainly an interesting book, but quite fantastic! Several concepts were intriguing, but as the author spins his tale, he leaves out facts that could help support his claims based on the fact that ""his memory was erased,"" or ""the subject matter is still top secret.""Furthermore, by emphasizing that the book is non-fiction in nature, detracts from its credibility.In addition, sketches are included for the technically minded, but it just seems to be another ploy to lend credibility to the whole story.I cannot say that the author is printing untruths, as a matter of fact, I'd like to see that this technology exists. It was certainly an entertaining book, and does inspire thought, but it could have more hard facts to support the validity of the invisibility projects."
2,Science-Fiction,"The author has a very good fantasy. Al the things that have happened according to his report look very ""scientific"", rather exaggerated and to good to be true. I work 22 years as a hypnotherapist with a good experience in psychology, science, esoteric and paranormal matters, biofeedback, mechanics and electronics. What I have read sounds like interesting SCIENCE-FICTION, not a trustful report of the reality.No person can consciously live without his higher cortex. And white noise is definitely not ""being 50% of everything"" as mentioned, but a combination of all frequencies at the same time. The book contains numerous impressing statements about well known scientist and the author gives the impression to be an expert on various disciplines. In the book is an order form for other books and a subscription for a magazine ""The Montauk Pulse TM"". All very well organised and highly commercial. But is it true ? I doubt"
1,Ridiculous,"This book is poor fiction---by his own admission the author uses ""soft facts"" Read: ""made up crap"". This is like a mash of all the 60's and 70's bad sci-fi written down by a delusional and terribly untalented writer. I had hoped for something of a documentary approach to something like this, but that is not to be seen here. Do NOT waste your money."
1,Absolute load of crap,"Completely unsubstantiated. It is obvious that the person whom the author supposedly writes about is a paranoid schizophrenic. Not even amusing reading, just plain painful. Terrible writing style, incredibly short book that jumps around from topic to topic way too quickly. Go ahead and waste your money. If reading about people being sent to Mars and giant killer beasts created out of people's imaginations while hooked up to 'electromagnetic coils' is your cup of tea then by all means go ahead and support more trash like this being published."
1,Disappointing,"You could probably read this (150 odd page) book in one day if you really wanted to. My initial interest in this subject was piqued by studying a map of Long Island, NY, where the bulk of the events purportedly take place. I read up until the point when the author started taking about the ""hairy monster-beast,"" and that was it for me. Psycho-babble rubbish if you ask me. Sounds like the author had a bad dream (or perhaps a bad acid trip), and decided to write a book a la a repressed memory tome. Very little, if any of the claims made in the book are substantiated or corraborated by outside sources. Kinda reminded me of one of those alien stories featured in supermarket tabloids like the World News Observer or something."
1,Ridiculous book,"I bought this book as a random curiosity. It wasn't even an interesting read, and the ""facts"" it contains are completely ridiculous."
4,"Interesting reading, especially if you're into conspiracies.","This book is not bad. It weaves an interesting story that sheds some light on one of the greatest conspiracy theories of our time (Philadelphia Experiment). While the writing style may be considered a bit juvenile, I found it to be easy reading. Moon does not go into incredible details on how some of the technical aspects. Thankfully, he keeps the tech jargon to a minimum and understandable to those of us who lack a PhD in electrical engineering.I recommend the book, even though it was quick reading, it did weave a most interesting tale that collaborates the stories of others who were involved."
1,Ridiculous,"I was very much looking forward to this book but regretted starting it after only a few pages. Now, I'm game for a good conspiracy theory as much as anyone, but this book is downright preposterous. Nothing can be proven (outside the fact that there is indeed a military base in Montauk). Very little in the book even makes any sense - and the fact that the authors are tragically inept writers that can barely construct a sentence doesn't help matters. Content aside, I have NEVER read a book outside of children's literature that was so poorly and elementally written.After finishing, I had to find out what kind of company would actually publish something like this... and, lo and behold, sky books turns out to be owned by the author.How they manage to keep releasing MORE books is beyond me. My recommendation: avoid this at all costs."
1,Bad science fiction and bad attempt at non-fiction,"I was given this book to read on a vacation. Reading quickly I was able to find circular illogic, assertions that were just factually an impossibility(color x-rays), completely dubious facts and found the technical aspect of the book to be pure rubish with convoluted machinations on the actual events and methods to produce the. However, the author was able to wax on about the technical aspects of the machines used by the conspiritors to no end, all while conveying no real information. This is a poor representation of the classic conspiracy book - make wild and waving gestures with one hand to the wide eyed audience while picking their pocket with the other. In short, this book is filled with infotainment, unfortunately to little info and to little entertainment. Small unchallenging minds will sop it up, but if you consider yourself mildly intelligent waste your time elsewhere. I wish I had."
5,Wedding Planning Made Easy!,This two part video (The Bridal Plan) was the best part of planning my wedding. The videos were filled with great ideas and how to's. I would recommend this to anyone planning a wedding!
3,Decent,I bought this because of one song in particular and apparently didn't preview the rest. It didn't really stick for me. Turned out it was the only song I really liked on the cd. :(
3,greasy,"Wild Ride Beef Stick, Hot & Spicy, 15 Count 1-Ounce Packsnot hot and spicy , but the grease burnded going down .not a good choice for me ."
2,Insipid drawings,"I could not bring myself to purchase this book. The illustrations, which are the highlight of these series of books, are very static and uninteresting."
4,nice for the price,"photo does not show how pretty and warmer the leopard color is, comfy and sexy, wrap is long enough to tie a few ways for different looks. Shipping was fast and FREE! get a pair before they sell out, similar shoes I seen are more expensive on the web, wish they had them in the black too."
4,"Fun to build, tricky to play with","Based on the response from my 6-year-old son, this toy is pretty cool. The cycle was challenging to build, however the instructions were very easy to follow. The Toa builds very similarly to other Bionicles and comes with his unique Mask of Light. The only problem we have is that the Toa's arms pop off when you take him off of his cycle, which can become a little frustrating. All-in-all, good choice for a Bionicle lover."
5,An Excellent Recording of a Timeless Classic,"After reading various reviews on this site (and others) of this and other recordings of Beethoven's 9th, I decided to select this one, and I'm glad I did. It is an excellent ""all-around"" recording of one of the greatest classical works of all time. From the quality of the sound/recording (vocal and orchestral), to the nearly flawless execution by the performers, to the interpretation of the work by the conductor -- this is truly great from an overall perspective. There are many terrific recordings of the 9th (I also own Karajan/Berlin and Furtwangler/Bayreuth Festival, and have heard a number of others, such as Bernstein at the Berlin Wall), but this one stands out as one of the finest. For a wonderful survey of the various recordings available, check out this informative article by Carl Nelson on Amazon: http://www.amazon.com/gp/richpub/syltguides/fullview/PIMO74V323TZ."
3,For the Armchair Explorer,"Enjoying photography & Urban Exploration myself, I've toyed with the idea of possibly compiling my work into a coffee table book (of primarily photos). I decided to purchase this book to see how the ""competition"" was.Honestly, I wasn't impressed. Not trying to tout myself as some kind of ""pro,"" but most of the info in this book was simply common sense. As in, if you didn't realize these things before, maybe you shouldn't really be climbing around abandoned buildings and the like. Really. Being a lover and hoarder of books, I rarely get rid of them but this one did indeed make it into the garage sale pile. If you really have ants in your pants about getting literature on this before doing some exploration of your own, I'd recommend ""Access all Areas"" by Ninjalicious, or save yourself some money and check out the UE forums. You might meet some friends to go out with and you'll definitely pick up better information than this book has to offer."
2,What diffuser?,I'm kind of disappointed in this because there's not much of a smell when you enter the room unlike the first one I had which was lovely for a long time. Maybe this one had been sitting around & lost it's oomph. Very expensive for very little.
4,Good Collection; Good Intro to Rick Nelson,"This is a pretty good collection of Rick Nelson songs. Or should we say, ""Ricky"" Nelson songs, since most of these recordings are from his teen idol days. Still, they give you a very good taste of what made him popular, and the recordings are outstanding. Most of the big hits are there, but if you're a fan of his later work, you'll be disappointed. That's why I'm not giving it 5 stars. ""Garden Party"" and ""She Belongs to Me"" are the only Stone Canyon Band era songs on this collection. Nonetheless, it's a good introduction if you want to become familar with an artist whose reputation is growing more and more each year after his untimely death. For me, this will be what I'm listening to until I get his ""Legacy"" box set."
3,Disappointing,"I highly recommend that you buy the two CD's that contain his first 4 albums. They are available on Amazon. I was a big fan of Ricky when I was young but this collection simply doesn't have some of his best upbeat songs like ""Waitin' in School."" He had a great voice, a real feel for rock, but his star faded quickly. A lot of songs on this CD show the ""over-management"" by his father who kept trying to keep the songs in the ""easy listening"" category. Song after song is ruined by corny Jordanaires background vocals. As I said at the beginning, get ""Ricky"" and ""Ricky Sings Again,"" if you really want to hear his best stuff."
5,best of the best,"This is also a gift for my brother's 60th bday, Friday. He's mentioned how Ricky Nelson was such a great loss when he was killed in that plane crash & how great his songs were. His favorite was Garden Party. He will LOVE ALL these songs. I liked Travelin' Man, best. What a gorgeous man he was, too. The vivid blue color in his eyes made this cover perfection. In fact, I may purchase another one for myself!"
5,Rick really can sing,"I had forgotten how many hits Rick had back in the day and some of them were really good songs. He started out as kind of a joke, singing a song on his parents tv show as a teenager but he became a good singer and had some legitimate success on his own. This disc sound great and has all of the important work from his rock career plus his last hit ""Garden Party"""
5,"Creative, fun and easy to follow","I have had this book for quite some time and was pleased with the variety of recipes and ideas it presented. I expected much less for the price. The introduction contains info on roasting, selecting, brewing, steaming milk and other important details. It contains a section of hot drinks without alcohol and another section of drinks containing alcohol. Those are followed by a section of cold drinks with and without alcohol. The final section is a collection of recipes incorporating espresso as one of the ingredients. Some recipes are: Espresso Jack Daniels Rib Sauce; Pork Tenderloin with Espresso Sauce; Espresso Special Chili; Red Beans and Rice; Tiramisu; Espresso Chocolate Cheesecake; Espresso Pecan Pie; Chocolate-Espresso Gelato; Espresso-Scotch Frosting and Espresso Truffles. I recommend this book to those who love coffee and also enjoy trying new things. There's lots of fun to be had here and it's a great starter if you're new to the realm of espresso drinks."
1,Full disclosure would have been nice..,"I purchased this product per my doctor's recommendation to assist in an infertility issue. When I got the product the bottle stated do not take if you are wanting to get pregnant, might become pregnant or are breastfeeding. I then looked at what else they put in the product and it has a 50% alcohol solution! This is completely STUPID considering its a highly used/recommended to help women GET PREGNANT! This company really needs to rethink their products. I am hoping to return and get a complete refund. I cannot believe that 1. this was not disclosed on the website and 2. that a company would put an herbal remedy for women's health in alcohol of any kind."
4,Very good shave cream,"This is a wonderful shave cream. However, it is foolish to buy unless you purchase at a Kiehl's store.If you like DE shaving, it is excellent shave cream. Using it WITHOUT a brush works, but is a waste. You can practically lather your entire body with a nickel size dollop, if you whip it in a warm cup with warm water.It also works better, the longer you let it sit on your face.That being said, this is also the case with other glycerin based shaving soaps. I really like the menthol feel and scent."
5,Unquestionably the best,"The first true shaving CREAM I have ever seen or used. Not shaving foam, like the rest. This stuff is the real McCoy. The BEST shave possible. I shave daily and each container should last about a month. Expensive, but worth it."
1,Warning - these are Mens socks!,"I ordered these socks for ""Adults"" not realizing that they are Mens socks and the sizes listed are Mens sizes. Needless to say the Large at a Mens foot size 10-12 is WAY too big for my Women's foot size 9. Otherwise, they appear to be very good socks."
2,cheap and poor,"It was the attraction of having a multiple features on one device and the compatible price that drove me for the purchase. But I found the product doesn't have software to support,I mean it's very difficult to navigate through this device. The touch screen is very dull, so surfing become a VERY frustrating event. I don't know how long the battery suppose to last, but it's not long. Also, I can't charge the power through a computer. My iTune doesn't recognize the device. So I can't use podcast.The device made realize that I took many good features as granted on my iPod which lack on this device, such as clock, battery life and music/podcast upload synchronizing."
5,Great socks for standing on cold concrete,These are great socks that are long lasting and add comfort to my shoes all day! I have used them for several years now. :)
3,Warm.. but terrible fit.,"These socks are nice and thick, but don't stay up for anything. They are the same width from the toes to the top and have no contour to help with the transition between foot and ankle, so they are very loose around the ankles. If I wear them in the house without shoes, I always end up 3 inches of sock out in front of my toes. They definitely could use some fitting help..."
4,Comfortable and warm,The pair of socks are ok but it has less wool quality than I though. It keeps you you warm but I think it has the risk of being unstitched anytime.
3,scratchy wool,I thought they would be a lot softer. I will have to wear sock underneath because they are very itchy.
3,Warm but slide down,"Check out the title. Of course they're warm, but they slide down too much. Haven't had much need for them outside yet, but I keep the house cold and these socks are very warm."
3,OK product,"Definitely keeps your toes warm but the elastic is not of the finest quality. After only a few times wearing them, they have started to run down my feet and I need to sometimes take my shoes off and pull up my socks."
2,Not what I had hoped for,"These socks were a disappointment for me. My feet get cold easily and I've been trying to find some good warm socks. So when I see a sock called ""40 Below"" I assume they are going to be warm. Here's what's wrong with them:1. The part of the sock that covers your foot is actually not that thick. This is the part that needs to be thick! The leg portion is very thick, but that's why I have thermals and pants. I need coverage for my foot! Needless to say, my feet still get cold when wearing these. I'd rather not need to buy thermal lined boots to keep my feet warm in the winter. I had hoped these socks would do the trick.2. They stretch out immediately and from day one they have been too loose. I have size 12 feet. They are normal sized feet. The socks were supposed to be good for size 9-12 (The large). I find they get bunched up because of the extra material floating around in my shoe and they fall down my calf."
5,Great for outside or inside during cold of winter,"I live in an old ground floor apartment. I do not know if there is any insulation under my apartment floor, but I do know there is no basement. My floor is always very cold in the winter, which makes you feel cold, unless you have the electric heat on pretty high, which is very expensive. I bought these socks and they are perfect. My feet now feel nice and toasty warm, even if I have been sitting with my feet on the floor a long time. They also keep my feet very warm outside in the cold."
4,Quick & Useful _bike bottle holder/ cage,"Excellent alternative to the average bike bottle holders/ cages. The velcro strap design is a useful option for my folding bike that does not have the typical circular ""down tube"" ( the slanted bar in the middle of the bike). This is also useful for any bike that does not have pre-drilled holes or a good location for the regular cages that use screws.Cons:The strap has a hard piece of rubber at the top, in order to keep the cage in place, but this is Not enough. I had to add an extra piece of flat/ bendable rubber to the bottom half- between the strap & the bike. Now it's snug and doesn't move.The metal cage fits the included bottle vey well, but not smaller/ narrower types. I have to put something around it - to hold my narrower bottles in place."
4,Great roller set,"I bought 2 sets at a beauty supply store about 5 years ago. What a hardy set. These babies last forever. Yes, the lid is plastic and flimsy. But if you read reviews on other sets, almost every device people are complaining about a flimsy lid.They come with metal clips which snuggly hold the roller. Sets hair in no time and lasts all day. And if you use a heat protection spray before you roll your hair, curls last twice as long and are very soft to the touch.I stupidly stacked my 2 sets while heating because I don't have the counter space at my small sink. Melted a hole in the center of the bottom plastic lid. So don't do that.My only drawbacks are the ""color/size coded"" pins. They are navy blue, black and pink. Navy and black look downright identical and I always grab the wrong size. My other complaint is that I think my rollers do overheat from time to time.Other than that. I love this set. No beginners curve either. Easy to use the first time."
5,"Love the jawbreakers, but not many in each box.","I was hoping to get more if I ordered a case of the candy, but each box is about 1/2 full. Still love them and will buy them again, just a little disappointed."
2,A to Z french food.,The write up in this book is very small could not read it. Was not what I expected for aculinary dictionary. Will not recomment.
4,A good example of the Crestline Series,"These books were written to be as comprehensive as is humanly possible for each of the various marques they cover. I find them to be a tremendously useful reference, and an interesting read as well. The majority of this book is from the original ""Sixty Years of Chevrolet"", which was written back when Camaros were used cars at best. Therefore there is no great emphasis on the V8 period of Chevrolet's history, which will bother the performance types. Also, in any hand written (i.e. no spellcheck!) volume of this breadth there are going to be a few typos and errors, and most of these in this book are very obvious. However, if your interests run beyond just the high performance aspects of the Chevrolet marque, or if you want a good comprehensive background in how Chevrolet got itself into the position where it could become the performance icon it is, this is best book available."
4,Love of a strong willed redhead saves the day.,"Josh is on the fast track to success, but he needs a trophy wife to make a good impression with the executives. Katie, who wants to save the family photography business, needs an extension on the defaulted loan. The loan made at the bank where Josh works. Josh being the man Katie's sister jilted at the altar. Katie has a lot of hard work ahead of her. Risky Business uses some of my favorite romance spices - strong sexual attraction, the supposedly oil and water mix of a wild character with a buttoned down one, and, as their love grows, each strenghtens the others weaknesses of character. Also helping the book skip along is a nice sense of humor. By the end I was in love with Katie myself. Recommended."
2,Not the color!,"I liked the watch, but the color on the picture is deceiving! I thought it was gray, but it was some kind of dark beige or like brownish. It seems that they show a black and white picture as the dial has some blue on the backgrownd."
4,Good choice!,"It's a very nice watch. It's a little bit difficult to understand the numbers, but it's ok."
2,Should have paid more attention...,"This rack is the right size for my pot--however, I should have paid more attention to the location of the ""feet"" on the rack. If the jars shift during the boil, which they almost always do, the rack will tip to the sides where there are no feet, which causes the jars to slide over and lie sideways in a heap. This rack needs feet at four points for stability, not just two. Again, I should have paid more attention to the image before purchasing, but someone might benefit from my review. I'm trying to figure out a way to attach two more feet!!"
3,Needs a new edition,"I was hoping for good things from this booklet, as I am always looking for good material to help birth parents through the painful process of adoption. I appreciate that it's short, but I was disappointed because it was clearly written without open adoption in mind. The language is outdated and surprisingly not adoption-friendly, using terms that I avoid like the plague. If a new edition comes out, I'll try it again, but until then I don't use it with my clients."
1,KEEP YOUR BABY,"A mother who surrenders her baby for adoption NEVER gets over the loss. In fact the pain gets worse with time and expecially after reunion. Mothers experience Complex Post Traumatic Stress Disorder and Disenfranchised Grief and the children suffer from Attachment Disorders. Adoption is a 5 bil unregulated industry in the US with the babies being the commodities and the mothers being exploited for their babies. Adoption is NOT a ""loving option"" keeping your baby is. 80% of open adoptions close after 3 months of the adoption finalizing. Do not let anyone convince, coerce or brainwash you into signing those papers you will regret it for the rest of your life."
5,A surprise hit,"Perhaps because I was thinking ""pop up book"" and ""children's book"" were synonymous, I was pleasantly overwhelmed by the artistic creativity and print-manufacturing complexity of this entertaining and informative work. While edited by the staff of the Country Music Hall of Fame, the content is not Nashville-centric, but highlights the coast-to-coast folk influences on what we collectively call ""country"" today. Great side-bar pieces from artists ranging from Dolly Parton to Steve Earle give the book a healthy diversity in point-of-view...and clearly prove that pop-up books can be a grown-up medium."
5,Truth in Eating,"Eating is a good companion to Food, Inc. It covers the whys as well as encourages people to personally experience restored health which result from eating the original plant-based whole-food nutrition program. Great for sharing!"
5,WOW!WOW!WOW!,"This DVD is a must see for anyone who is sick and tried of being sick and taking medications. This book is on point and I truly enjoyed watching it! It is an awesome truth about how and what we eat and what we should eat to be healthy, fit and live a life of quality."
4,It will open your hearts and eyes,"I feel like my eyes were opened for the first time. After beginning a plant-based nutritional program, named R.A.V.E. Lifestyle Diet, I attained this DVD about a further step of awareness about the corporate business of FOOD. Or rather what is behind the curtain, concerning the deceptions fed to consumers, families, people without awareness of what food truly costs us. Our health, immune systems, and diseases like cancer.This DVD is essential to understanding how people are tricked into doing something unhealthy, while believing they are making wise choices. I would also recommend viewing the DVD titled: Healing Cancer from the Inside Out"""
5,great movie,"well done with this one very interesting,answer a lot of questions about what is going on in our world and how we are walking blind in our lives"
4,Good DVD to help with your diet/lifestyle decisions,"This is a DVD that promotes the benefits of a plant-based (instead of animal-based diet.) While I think it has some good information, one thing that did bug me was right at the beginning. It cited how years ago when people lived on more plant-based diets, things like heart disease and cancer were rare. Now this may be in fact true, but what did these people die of? They didn't live forever, but the DVD makes no mention of what diseases they did get. The DVD just skips right over the logical question.Like I said, this part was right at the beginning and slightly tainted my viewing of the rest of the DVD (like they were purposely avoiding information or something.) I did like the testimony from the interviewees and thought helped the viewers really relate to the information. I would recommend this as part (certainly not all) of your research on trying to live a more healthy lifestyle and with rethinking your eating habits."
5,Eating - Third Edition,"A must see! You will learn the truth. Every high school should be showing this video to educate our future lawmakers, taxpayers, and future mothers' and fathers'."
3,Not impressed,"It was just ""ok"". I wasn't really impressed by it. I really would not think of recommending it to anyone."
3,Eating - DVD,"The ""Eating"" DVD provides the viewer with information to support adopting a plant-based eating approach. The various presenters offer their reasons and rationales for this approach. ""Eating"" promotes the benefits of their approach by indicating the various health/wellness benefits to be acchieved."
2,Very repetative,"This is not a video I would purchase. It is repetative and put me to sleep. Many of the claims, although i believe to be true, are not backed up in enough depth for the new person. It makes a vegan or vegetarian diet look like something that will cure what ails you.. no more than a snake oil salesman. It just goes too far and is poorly made.To top it off i even agree that vegan or vegetarian is the way to go. You can look at other of my reviews. I don't think i have ever given something so low as a review as i have this. Don't bother buying it. It is not at all what I expected."
3,Goes Too Far,"This is quite informative and I would agree with a lot of what is said. However, when it goes on to say how almost every disease known to mankind can be cured by following the suggested diet, it goes too far. Throw away your meds on their say-so? I think not! I'd really like to see proof (double-blind studies) of those claims."
1,it took three sittings to listen to it - that bad,"Let me put it like this. I collect EVERYTHING by guitarist Al Pitrelli - I might just be the only Pitrelli collector. I've certainly not many anyone with my collection. A track he co-wrote with Joe Lynn Turner is on this compilation so I had to get it. Now, I do listen to everything. This hour long album took me three sittings to get through. It wasn't that I didn't have the time. My brain and ears were melting from anguish. Ballads are great, but too many overstuffed, overemotive ballads is not great. These musicians might have made you good but in this context that greatness is totally weakened. Let alone, these aren't necessarily their best work. Don't buy."
3,Promises! Promises!,"Jayne Mansfield's most revealing movie. Need I say more? Though the movie is in Black & White it was the subject of a Color layout in PLAYBOY....one of their best selling editions. If you're a Marilyn, Mamie and Jayne fan this is a must for your collection.Promises! Promises! (Amazon.com Exclusive)"
4,"""Wow!!!""","Both the picture and sound is great. So are the 'extras'. Unfortunately, it is not 'close-captioned'. Definitely if you are a 'Jayne Mansfield' fan. Thank so much."
3,Old-Fashioned but Fun,This a quaint 60s film with Jayne fully visible. I remember going to the college Friday night event and it was the R-rated one. This is the full deal. It is certainly old-fashioned but interesting and fun.
3,Yeah..... not bad,"Yeah mate, its not a bad single. '1000 Miles' is good, as is 'Coming Home' (Acoustic Version).Simply put, buy it if ya love him."
1,Stinky deal,"I requested a NEW book for my grandson as a Christmas gift for $39.30 + $3.99 shipping (no FREE shipping), but received an old musty smelling, dog-eared book instead! Finally got my money back, but no reinbursment on my return shipping!"
2,Alarmingly poor formatting,"The poems appear as charts, so if they are longer than a few lines the bottom half is invisible on a normal kindle-sized page. The text of the forward, while mildly informative, has random unnecessary page-breaks as well, more noticable on larger viewing areas.After each poem/rhyme there's a page that's blank except for the page number. I expect there's supposed to be an illustration on the blank pages, but that didn't end up on the kindle, and instead it just takes longer to get around in the book.The page numbers (as you can probably guess) are left in the text, and there's no table of contents or illustrations.There's plenty of other Mother Goose books for free on the kindle, and I'd suggest you go find one of those rather than wasting time with this one."
5,Mother Goose -the Original Volland Edition,"This is a beautiful book. The rhymes are timeless and the illustrations are particularly nice. Quite old-fashioned, but quality endures. This is a book that a young child can look at for long periods of time and get lost in. The children in my class select it from the shelf over and over again."
5,Hands down the best!,"This is my first positive review for a product. Usually I only review products that make me rant and swear, but this time it's not the case. I simply love this backpack. It is comfortable, stylish, and most importantly it's functional. There is a place for EVERYTHING and I don't have to leave books/laptop home anymore for class. I am a man who sometimes wishes I could have a man purse to hold all the stuff I need during the day. Fortunately there's a more masculine option and here it is. My iPod, cell phone, water bottle, folders, books, laptop (separate hidden and well padded compartment) and writing utensils all have a happy home. My girlfriend laughs at me because I like to bring things I couldn't possibly need to school just because it fits and it's comfortable and doesn't hurt my back. I test this pack EVERY day and it hasn't let me down over the past 2 mos. Thanks Lowepro!!"
5,"Great backpack, great price!","I wasn't really sure about buying this backpack, but decided to because of all of the great reviews. The backpack arrived surprisingly quickly after ordering and it's much better than my old backpack. It's very comfortable and helps support my back well with all of the stuff I have to carry in my backpack. The laptop area is just the right size for my laptop, although if you have an older, bulkier laptop it's unlikely to fit in the backpack. Aside from that, the only complaint I have is that I can't fit as much in this backpack as I could in my last one, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. All in all, a great bag, nice places for everything you need to carry: books, pens/pencils, cell phone, extra keys... They also started selling these for almost twice the price that I bought it at my local bookstore, so it's definitely worth purchasing on Amazon rather than in store."
1,Disregard Made in USA Claim,"I recently received this item and was very disappointed to see ""Made in China"" on the package. I'm sure they'll work ok, but I really, really, really do not want to buy any Chinese crap if I can help it. And the one and only reason I went for this particular pair of nippers and didn't buy a pair at the local Lowe's (because they peddle a lot of this Chinese crap also) is because the words ""Made in USA"" was right there in plain English in this product's description. I honestly can't go as far as to say that I was a victim of the ol' bait-n-switch because what I got was a pair of nippers whose item number and bar code both matched the numbers 32015. I just think that someone at Amazon wasn't paying attention when writing the description for this particular product. So if buying US made products is important to you, then you need to look elsewhere because these definitely aren't made in the USA. Hence the 1 star rating."
4,Neat overview with many good references,"The book is a nice overview of many important issues arising in decision making in real organizations. The author was able to draw on his prior industrial and personal experience to explain the issues. The author may have sacrificed depth for accessibility, but he did provide a large number of references for those who are interested in exploring the issues much deeper. The main merit of the book is bringing together different methodologies by listing and illustrating their main points and fields of application."
3,Overview with to many words,"The book provides an interesting overview on different models. Unfortunately, even simple aspects are explained very extensively(e.g. what is a system). The book is therefore somewhat boring to people who are looking for help in their business and do not want to read an academic novella."
1,This is not a book,"This is not a book, rather it is a poorly done article that has the apperance of a simple cut and paste 8.5 page advertisement for the Lukaszewski Group.This purchase was a mistake and I'll be returning it.I am an activist and this ""thing"" is basically full of stale worthless information."
5,100 % guarantee,"The company that makes the apron is one oriented to the customer. My apron had a slightly imperfection and they send a new one for me. Isnt that being interested in your customers?Anyway, the apron is very practicall, made with good materials and a nice embordery. Buy one, you are going to be satisfied!"
5,the only band that matters,"Duran Duran's second album is the most beautiful thing I've ever listened to. So full of substance and depth. How could anyone choose the Police over this? It's impossible! Listen to the incredible ""Hungry Like the Wolf"" and the haunting ""The Chauffer,"" and you'll realize that this is no ordinary band. This is an execptionally talented group that is so MUCH better than the Police. ""Rio"" sold millions of millions of records and is one of the best sellers of all time. It got reissued in 2001 so obviously there is still a demand for this band even after all this time. Please, ignore any 1 star reviews of this album. They are written by people with NO TASTE in music."
5,They robbed Roxy Music and Japan - but did an amazing job,"This is a great record. I'm not sure why there are so many hostile Duran Duran haters on Amazon. If there is a criticism, it's that Rio isn't as groundbreaking as some might believe. They ""borrowed"" the musical sound from Roxy Music's Country Life. Just listen to ""Out Of The Blue"" next to ""Save A Prayer"". It's almost note for note. They also lifted a lot from Japan, especially their ""Quiet Life"" album. Simon Lebon and David Sylvian could almost be the same singer. Those criticisms aside, Rio is a lot catchier and more immediate than Country Life and Quiet Life. The songwriting is fantastic. The music is brilliant. The lyrics are tolerable. It's hard to find a better album from the 80s or ANY time period."
1,The remastering is awful,"Don't buy this remastered version because it will make you sick!I have the original USA 82 release on CD. Yes, it's a 16bit recording, but it sounds 400x better than this remastered version.The remastered offering is over filtered on the high band, so it sounds like AM radio ""low to mid-range sound"".The sound engineer really dropped the ball on this CD.I recommend buying the ""unmastered"" version."
5,Classic Duran Duran,I give this album top rating mainly for Hungry Like The Wolf and the original studio version of Save A Prayer.
2,"Hungry like the wolf, empty like its stomach","Words resurrected from the netherworld and assembled in a manner that could be called abstract, if Slick Rich could sing it like that. Musical arrangements as flat and colourless as a razor blade. Like a razor blade, it seems pleasing and smooth at first. Then one really listens and discovers that, actually, this baby is nasty, sharp, and dangerous. Since it's one of the best examples of the soulless, superficially-divine pop of the Eighties, the album's artifactual; but unless this became a personal favourite as you were growing up in that period, just leave it on the shelf--or better yet, in the closet."
1,Video Glitch for Win2000 & WinMe,"If you are running Win2000 or WinMe and you do not have QuickTime installed on your computer, DO NOT follow the link provided on the enhanced portion of this CD. If you do, you will be downloading an older version of QuickTime that is compatible only through Win98. The result could be severe audio breakup. Instead, go to Apple's site and download the current version of QuickTime [v.5.0.2] which is compatible with Win2000 & WinMe and follow the installation instructions. Then get ready to be disappointed with the notecard-sized videos. As for the CD audio...mastered much too bright. As for the failure to use the ALBUM MASTER to cut the CD...shame on EMI/Capitol. Very amateurish. This disc is a great disappointment. P.S...Where is the ZERO in the ratings system???"
1,not recommended,please stay far away from this cheesy new wave 80's pop album from these defunct musicians who are irrelevant as nobody listens to them anymore.songs like hungry like the wolf and lonely in your nightmare sound very dated and overall this album has aged badly.avoid at all costs.get any cd from bachman turner overdrive instead.
1,AWFUL,I JUST CANNOT COMPREHEND HOW ANYONE CAN GIVE THIS LOUSY ALBUM FIVESTARS.THIS IS OUTDATED CHEESY EIGHTIES DANCE POP MUSIC FROM THESE HAS BEEN MUSICIANS WHOM VERY FEW PEOLPE LISTEN TO THESE DAYS.I WOULD REQUEST YOU TO GIVE THIS LOUSY ALBUM A SKIP.GET THE BEST OF FOGHAT INSTEAD.
2,Where are the remixed versions?,"Like many people are trying to say here, this cd doesn't have the versions which were remixed by David Kershenbaum. The vinyl version released in North America when this came out had remixed versions of Rio, Lonely in your Nightmare, Save a Prayer, Hold Back the Rain, Hungry Like the Wolf, and My Own Way. If you listen to the vinyl version and this cd, you can tell, some of the differences are pretty obvious, others are more subtle. My understanding is the band themselves preferred the remixed versions to the originals that this CD has.Unfortunately, Capitol didn't give us the remixed versions, so those of us who grew up in the 80's loving the vinyl/cassette versions of Rio will have to settle for our vinyl copies until Capitol records gets off their butts and issues them remastered...something that they should have done in the first place!"
3,Why mess with success???,"I agree with everyone who says that Rio is a fantastic album, but why did Duran Duran have to go and mess with several of the tracks when they remastered it? ""Hold Back the Rain,"" in particular, has some really cheese-bag keyboards imposed heavily over what used to be an interesting guitar track. They obviously tried to ""disco up"" the remaster, but only succeeded in ruining a few awesome tracks. I'm particularly upset about the fact that this is not mentioned anywhere that I might be able to know it before buying the CD. Two thumbs down for messing around with an album that was perfect the way it was when it was first released."
3,Mixed Thoughts,"For a single woman, this book would be perfect. But for those that are married, I just don't see it being all that useful. I bought it to help spice up my marriage, but it really was more focused on those that are single and still searching for their partner in life."
1,Don't waste your time,What tramp needs to do this stuff to get a man? Have some self esteem and not only will men love you ... you'll love yourself! I guess I'm not that little insecure girl that is so desperate for a man's love that she's willing to compromise her body and values!
1,I would have given this a lower score if I could...,"What a waste of time & money.. I found this in the bargain bin at Barnes & Noble. Now I know why...If you know ANYTHING about sex this will not help. I was hoping for something spicy, not the lame (B)ad-libs. Pahlease!! I do not need anyone telling me how to talk, walk or breathe. I was hoping for info on how to really put some pizazze in my love life, not cheesy stuff I knew in HS. Save your money, you can read more informative things on the web for FREE!!SJ"
5,Excellent,This book helped me to become more comfortable with my body and my sexuality. This in turn has helped me enjoy sex and have fun!
1,This Book Sucks,"This book is writen in the most condisending way imaginalbe. Barbara Keesling knows everything - you know nothing. Barbara Keesling is sexy - you are not. Not all nice girls are nice only because they are repressed fridged little girls trying to avoid growing up. You can be a nice girl and still be sexy, something the author seems to disagree with. You don't have to regect the part of you that likes being nice to have a good sex life and you don't have to be bullied into thinking that you are not a complete person if you don't."
