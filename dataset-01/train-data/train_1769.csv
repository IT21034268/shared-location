3,Average Book by a Great Writer,"I liked the style of five voices but the middle seemed to drag on. Each character would tell about the same event with only minor information changed - almost like it was just a page filler. The story line was enjoyable, and without this repeating I would have liked the book a lot better."
3,Song of the humback Whale,"Songs of the Humpback Whale: A Novel in Five VoicesThis is probably one of, if not actually the first of her novels, even though it is the last one I read, having gone through all her other ones. It shows the promise of what an excellent writer she would become, but was lacking, in my estimation, the depth of experience regarding relationships, which she has brought to her later work. I also found confusing the storytelling, which switches back and forth, between five narrators, describing the same situation from each one's personal point of veiw. Nevertheless, most enjoyable and thought provoking, like all her writing."
3,White Noise,"I understand Ms. Picoult's desire to present compelling stories of modern day family life in literary packages but she unnecessarily complicates her first novel, ""Songs of the Humpback Whale"", with multiple narrators (at least you learn this up front on the title page) including a character that tells her story on a reverse timeline. Assuming she did her research right, I did learn quite a bit about the behavior of humpback whales, which I'm sure has some relationship to the behavior of the humans in the story, though I didn't take enough time to sort it all out. My wife and daughter are big Picoult fans, but they struggled with ""Songs of the Humpback Whale"" as well.Three stars for taking on a challenging structure and for interesting technical info on humpback whales."
3,Not my favorite Jodi Picoult book,"I have recently been introduced to Jodi Picoult's books by a friend of mine and this is the third that I have read (The first was Picture Perfect and the second was The Tenth Circle). I liked this one the least. I didn't like the way the story was arranged - with the prologue telling the ending but I DID like the story in 5 voices. I was also bored with Oliver and his whales and can't imagine how Jane could live with him. SPOILER: Finally, I hated the ending but understand it when considering that Jane was the adult child of an alcoholic father and was also sexually abused.I agree with an earlier reviewer that it took a long time to get through this book. I normally read at least a book a week and this one took me two weeks to plow through. That being said, the characters were well developed and the story was certainly well told. This was definitely a wonderful first book for Jodi Picoult and I will continue to read her others."
4,Good book...,This was again a good book. It is not my favorite from Jodi but definitely worth the read.
3,"Starts fairly confusing, ends shabbily","I think the book started well, if a tad confusing.Had to go back and forth a few tiimes to understand how it was written.It was written from the future backward to the present and even the past. Trust me, pretty confusing.For me, the end was dissappointing. No completion or closure especially after spending time detailing the story.The male characters sometimes sounded real and other times, confusing also.I would have rated this a 2 but in fairness, the story started off well."
3,Needs real concentration...,I enjoyed the book but needed to go back and reread some parts to find out what the character was referring to...
2,Decent,"Not her best, but not as bad as The Pact. I appreciated the fact that the ending was less extreme than My Sister's Keeper. Her lack of knowledge of San Diego was frustrating. The book was written around Dr. Jones obsession with whales. However, I don't understand why she didn't use the real world-renowned Scripps Institute of Oceanography. She seems to sprinkle locations and information about San Diego throughout the book, yet I always had the feeling she was gathering the information from the internet because she seemed unfamiliar with the area."
1,Songs of the Humpback Whale,"If this was the first Jodi Picoult book that I read, I would never read another. That being said, I found that this book could not keep my interest. I am thankful to my younger sister for recommending Salem Falls and Plain Truth for me to read. She had told me that she had found a wonderful new author for me to try. I am glad I listened to her. I am also glad that I read this book, for it made me appreciate the growth of a very special author. This book was the latest book of hers that I bought,(I own her entire collection) and I could not recommend this book for a first time reader of Jodi Picoult. So, if you want to read this book, please read other books by her first, I'm glad I did."
2,Picoult's Weakest Novel,"I've read most of Picoult's books, and this - her first - is the weakest by far. Still worth reading if you are a die-hard Picoult fan. Thankfully her books have improved over time!"
5,Great Condition!,"I bought this book as a used book and it is in wonderful condition!! No rip, tears, or missing pages. Good purchase!"
1,Not so much...,"I had heard that Jodi Picoult is one of the best fiction authors out right now, so I decided to pick up one of her books. Not knowing that it was her first novel, I grabbed Songs of the Humpback Whales. I thought the story sounded interesting and the idea of the five perspectives was interesting to me...well, I couldn't even finish this book. I usually become very involved in the stories I'm reading and often read late into the night and this book did NOTHING for me...it was work to get through a few chapters at a time. As I said before, I thought the idea of the following the different characters from chapter to chapter would be interesting...and it wasn't. It made the book very choppy and hard to follow...especially considering that the girl's story was written from the end to the beginning. Because of the lack of flow, I found myself completely disconnected from all the characters and I really didn't care about what happened to any of them...which is why I didn't finish the book."
3,A good effort,"Story of a family breakdown. After a fight, the mother sets out on a cross-country road trip with her teenage daughter to her brother's house. As we follow them on this trip, we learn about the mother's struggles with her marriage and family life. Simultaneously, the father, prominent whale expert who would rather watch whales than take care of his family, sets out to find them. While the multiple perspectives give a different style to this book, I still found it hard to empathize with the characters and their struggles. I do admire Picoult's work, especially as this was her first book, but it lacks some deeper layers and psychological insight."
5,One of my favorite novelists!,"I first became acquainted with Jodi Picoult when I read THE PACT two years ago, and fast became an avid admirer of her work.Family is the recurring theme in Ms. Picoult's novels and SONGS OF THE HUMPBACK WHALE is no exception. Told in five alternating voices, SONGS is the story of the search and discovery of true love and of second chances.SONGS OF THE HUMPBACK WHALE resonates with the beauty, grace and sensitivity of emotion and language that is Jodi Picoult's trademark."
3,Find of the humpback whales,Beginning was difficult to follow. As I got further into the book the story line became more clear. Always enjoy reading all Jodi Picoult books.
5,love,this was a great book! i flew through it and couldnt put it down! jodi picoult is a wonderful writer and her books are ones that you think about long after you have finished it
3,Okay,Light entertainment. Story line not very realistic.Light Entertainment. The story line did not seem very realistic nor did the characters.
2,waterlogged,Typically I can buy and enjoy any Picoult book but not this one. It was very disjointed due to the use of five narrators. That's right five! I enjoy vignettes and even flashbacks but using five narrators to tell one story was just too much.
5,Excellence and a great value!!!,"It DOES do everything it claims and then some! This burner will NOT make coasters out of your disk and with blue and purple l.e.d.s it is definitely a welcome change to the sea of green lights that cover my desk. The disk T@2 DOES work fine and is a pretty cool holigraphic type effect on the record side of the disk. It comes with a slew of software, the Nero alone is worth $50. You just CANNOT go wrong with this recorder, it is excellent ...! I am completely satisfied with mine and recommend it to EVERYONE who wants the best. ..."
2,Poor quality,Earrings are a good size but the stones look pretty cheap. Up close they look dirty and scratched. Save your money.
2,Of historical interest only,"Bassist/vocalist Ashley Hutchings was a founder of venerable British folk-rock outfits Fairport Convention and Steeleye Span, and remains actively involved in the genre. Despite that pedigree,I found ""The Gov'nur, Pt. 1"" disappointing. The set begins with a 60's skiffle session,moves on to several Fairport/Steeleye tunes, and covers the mid-70's onward with Albion Band and related projects.Many selections are of bootleg sound quality,(I should have read the fine print!) as they are previously unreleased outtakes, demos and live performances. While I appreciate eclectic styles, I still found the mix of country, skiffle, bluegrass,jigs,blues and reels a rather jarring listen. An interesting look at the ""raw dough"" that Hutchings brought to Fairport and company, but not the fully baked cake. You're better off with the original studio albums by the aforementioned bands."
1,Digital Computer Arithmetic Datapath Design Using Verilog HDL: CD-ROM included,"I would have liked to review this book, but unfortunately Amazon twice sent me a defect book that did not have the CD."
4,Visual and mathematical perspective until the renaissance.,A comprehensive review of the thought behind mathematical perspective and how it differs from our empirical experience. Explains how the concept of the infinate has forever altered the way in which we represent space in pictures. Short essay with extensive end notes.
2,And I'm usually such a fan...I swear!,"Man, I was so excited about this release that I ordered it directly from RedHouse Records...maybe I'm putting Greg Brown on a pedastal he just can't fulfill, but this album wasn't in the same league as Further In, or even Slant 6 Mind. But, the good news is that he's releasing ANOTHER new album in 2000, and I've heard one track that sounds VERY promising! Maybe he put the weaker tracks on Covenant and saved the best for last...here's hoping."
4,"Another musical gem, with a catch.","Some incredible songs performed beautifully, especially ""'Cept You and Me Babe"" and ""Lullaby"". ""Marriage Chant"", hidden at the end, is also great. What's not so great is the sound quality: grossly exaggerated, boomy bass. This might make your boom box or car radio sound better, but it [stinks] on a good system. ""Slant Six Mind"" was much better. I can't understand a few of the earlier reviewers that commented positively on the sound. There were two versions of this CD released - maybe that explains it - I have the later one."
3,Disappointing!,"Things start quite promising in this cd, with ""'cept You And Me"" and ""Rexroth's Daughter"", two richly testured songs that rank witth the best that Brown has ever done. But somehow the rest of the cd left me cold, unoriginal songs that could well be in many 70's or even 60's albums that no ones remembers. If you are new to Greg Brown and want to know what is the fuzz about then just dont start here, go the poet game or the dream cafe, they are two of the best cd's of the 90's."
5,It keeps growing and growing on me,"It has taken me some time to warm up to Slant 6 Mind and Covenant, but I enjoy them more with each listening. My favorite songs are Blues Go Walking, Marriage Chant and Walkin' Daddy, with the last being my favorite of the bunch. It is perhaps the most ""optimistic"" and tender song I've ever heard. Expresses emotions for fathers that many sons have difficulty expressing. It just lifts my spirit to hear it."
1,Completely flawed,"This book is filled with the intellectual dishonesty of Mr. Salo who distorts and destroys Tolkien's Sindarin while claiming at the same time that he is analyzing it. Noldorin words from the ""Etymologies"" become through a strange method Sindarin words, elei becomes ely (p. 97), bo Ceven becomes bo Geven (p. 146), etc.. Salo adapts through with wacky theories Tolkien's languages to his liking. Salo made up hundreds of words without ever signaling them to the reader (doler, gannadad, nimminnin, etc.). If you care for Tolkien work you don't need to buy this book.P.S. ""Hannon le"" does not mean a thing in Sindarin."
4,Thot provok study of pers growth thru literary protagonists,"Thought provoking study of personal growth potential using female literary protagonists as examples. Similar to style of heroic studies by Joseph Campbell. Bit academic, but well worth effort to read and digest. Was used as a text in local college lit. class at my suggestion. Interesting as a very personal read OR as study of contemporary literature, provoking lively discussion."
3,"Good album, but buy Red Bird Blue Sky first","I like Billy Crockett a lot, but for me, this album doesn't measure up to some of his earlier efforts. Its a good album, but if you don't have them already, buy ""Red Bird Blue Sky"" and/or ""Watermarks"" before you get this one."
5,Complete Wineskin,This book is awesome and it sets the standard for all 21st century churches that are seeking the last day outpouring of the Holy Spirit. It sets the Body of Christ in divine order. This is a must purchase for all those who are hungry and thirsty for the Lord's presence.
4,The Complete Wineskin,"I am loving this item, however it was a little damaged from the packaging when I received it. The book is awesome though."
5,WAYNE ROX!,"Wayne is a deifinite talent. I first saw them when they opened up for Five for fighting on their ""America Town"" tour. They were awesome! At first me and my friend were like, ""cmon, lets get to the real band"", but when wayne started playing, we were like ""whoa. these guys are awesome!"" I love their old rock type style, they are deifinitely keepers!!"
1,THIS IS NOT DAVID WAYNE'S BAND FROM METAL CHURCH,"I HAVE MISTAKENLY PURCHASED THIS ALBUM THINKING IT WAS FORMER METAL CHURCH AND REVEREND LEAD SINGER DAVID WAYNE,WHICH IS NOT.THIS IS NOT METAL AT ALL ITS SOFT AS TO MAKE YOU GO TO SLEEP."
4,wow! i saw them with Five for Fighting TOO!,"And I had the exact same reaction as the user below! I have to say, that they were really impressive live, but I did go pick up the album a few weeks ago, and it is really very beautiful and great....definatly a great summertime/driving around/watching fireflies at night kind of album. :)"
5,great,exactly the video i was looking for. i bought this years ago and lost it and glad to see i could find it and it be the exact same one i needed!!!
1,Far From The Wurst,"Movie Edit Pro 10 is superb software and a true bargain for the price. It has everything you need to make gorgeous looking DVDs and I've been able to archive my collection of rare VHS tapes to disc thanks to Magix Movie Edit Pro. The program is complicated and comes with a dense booklet. Since Magix is based in Germany, don't expect tech support... but, if you show patience, you will be rewarded with a stupendous software suite. From video enhancement to sixteen mixing tracks, this is literally like owning a production house. Magix is the company to watch, offering everything Ulead and Abode is selling at a mere fraction of the cost."
2,Beware of Tech issues,"One of the best editing programs but BEWARE if you plan on making home movies over 20 min. you will more than likely run into crashes...I have used this program on two computers, one is a $3000 machine with a 4400 processor...still crashes."
4,great for the price!,"I have tried them all almost, ulead, pinnacle,sony vegas, but for some reason i keep coming back to magix. Its easy to use it you have the time gives you more then enough effects has both storyboard and timeline view, and is super cheap! The only thing is that if you have an AMD cpu like me you need to download a patch from there web page and it can be hard to find. other wise its pretty solid and rarely crashes. For the price its a great buy."
2,"Good for beginners, but NOT worth the trouble in the long run","I bought this for my Youtube channell, at first it was okay, but installing it was a major pain in the ass. rendering with it freezes your PC 90% of the time, and when it's not frozen, you'll be compleatly unable to look at your desktop. Rendering in SD is about all it can do, because understanding the book they send with it is mostly for the music program. All in all. it's okay-ish for beginners, or people who dont mind the verous problems. but if your serous about this hobby, job whatever. Get a better program."
1,Stat away from this product.,Try using the editor under Windows XP OS. I had to reinstall Movie Editor Pro 10 three times. After the thrid time I took the software off my system.
5,Looks CAN be deceiving!,"When I unpacked my little Eureka I was disappointed and thought that there must have been some mistake in my order---it looked so tiny and flimsy. I assembled it, tried it out, and low and behold it proved to be a hard-working little vacuum. It does a better job of picking up dog hair (I have two Black Labs) and dust than any other vacuum I have ever owned. It's very easy to empty and clean the filter, the cord is long enough that I don't have to keep unplugging it constantly, it's very light, sweeps under the bed and other furniture, the handle can be retracted for storage, and it can even be used as a hand vac! But most importantly--it does a super job of getting my floors clean. Great buy!"
2,More like a toy,"While this is good for a quick pickup of crumbs, anything larger is not going to be picked up. I use it on my hardwood floors and on a couple of floor mats. It does not pick up lint on the floor mats very well. It's very flimsy, so I don't expect it to last long. The cord wrap doesn't really hold well (the cord just falls off). You will need an old toothbrush to clean the filter, but it's not hard to do. I wanted a small vacuum with a cord, not battery operated and they are not easy to find. By the way, the cord is pretty small (I had to add an extension cord). So I'm still looking for the ideal small vacuum."
2,Good vac for quick pickup-deserves 4 stars,"This is a complete revision of an earlier review in which I complained about noise and hard-to-access dust cup - would now give it 4 stars but apparently am not allowed to change my initial rating during an ""edit"". Once I learned to press the release completely, I find the dust cup easy to access. It does a good job of picking up cat hairs and bits/pieces from the carpet surface and hardwood; the dust cup holds a much larger quantity than I would have expected from a vacuum this size. So lightweight - easy to grab out of a closet and give the house a once over. Would have given it 5 stars if it were not so noisy - I use earplugs when running it. People who seem to expect this vacuum to substitute for a full-size on carpet aren't being reasonable - this one does a great job for what it is intended."
5,Love this vacuum!,"I have two dogs and a cat and my house gets pretty hairy. This vacuum works better than the larger, more expensive ones I have used. I got it as a gift and just saw the price now. I cannot believe how cheap it is. I was thinking it was more expensive than the bigger ones because it is smaller and easier to use but works even better!It's very cheap, works great, small, light and you don't have to spend money on vacuum bags.I absolutely recommend this vacuum."
5,Eureka Stick Vacuum,"I had an old Eureka electric broom similar to this one. It picked up better when it was about to ""croak"" than others I have purchased when they were brand new. It is also easier to empty than others I have tried. I have hardwood floors and this vacuum works great."
5,Finally found it!,"I have looked and tried numerous small vacs and I finally found exactly what I want with this little magic vacuum. I have tile floors that are white. I also have a black haired dog. This vacuum picks up all the dog hair and cat hair with ease along with the crumbs from the kids. I like the fact that it's not cordless because it's not convenient for me to recharge a vacuum. The large bin is also a plus as I can vacuum the living room, kitchen, hallway and den without having to empty it between rooms. The only thing that could be better is to have the kids use it."
5,$25 King,"This is a bargain for $25, there are no belts, rotating brushes, or major parts to break. It picks up hair extremely well and gets dust as well. It is not intended to be a replacement for a full sized $100+ vacuum but gets the little jobs done better than those other cordless stick vacs. The cord is also short because it is meant for light jobs, not cleaning entire houses."
4,Great little vacuum!,"This is a great little vacuum for quick pick-ups on non-carpeted floors.I bought this to replace a Eureka electric broom that finally wore out after years of use. We have 1500 sq ft of laminate wood flooring, and with two dogs and two cats, their fur accumulates quickly...under tables,under the couch,in corners,etc. This vacuum gets into small spaces,is light weight,and very easy to use.It picks up so much off the floor that I find it best to clean the filter after each use (easy to get to and easy to clean).An added bonus is the wand attachment that fits right into the bottom of the vacuum.The only reason I gave it four rather than five stars is that the cord is very short...around 15 feet...and I've had to add an extension cord to it in order to maneuver around furniture."
4,"Noisy, but does the job","I love the fact that it is lightweight, my 5 year old can even use it. It does a good job on the kitchen and hardwood floors. I can even use it on some of my carpets. However, it is extremely loud. The person vacuuming has to wear ear muffs and everyone else has to go into another room."
2,Regretting this purchase,"I really, really wanted to like this product. It does have some great features, but the fact is that it doesn't pick much up, and I don't really need a vacuum that doesn't vacuum. It did actually pick up dog hair quite well, which was nice; however, it left most everything else. I'd end up sweeping after I vacuumed, since I never have ONLY dog hair on the floor. I know this isn't a regular vacuum--I have one of those--I got this for quick clean-ups, and it just doesn't cut it. I've since bought a more powerful stick in the $55-$60 range, and it's such a pleasure to have it accomplish what I bought it for! Learned the hard way on this one...you get what you pay for."
3,Boss sweeper,"It is lightweight and convenient, but the suction is weak at best. It is okay for quick pick ups between regular vacuuming. It is good that it is also a hand held dust buster which I use for my car."
1,Never even got to use IT!,I got this vacuum today and put it together and i couldnt even use it because where you open to take the dust cup out and empty it wouldNOT STAY CLOSED so without it closed you cant vacuum.I didnt know buying a NEW vacuum i would have to use duct tape to keep it together! NOT HAPPY!
1,BUYER BEWARE,BUYER BEWARE...product is not what they say it is. They do not tell you that item is out of stock and they shipped you what they call an upgraded model. It is NOT an upgrade at all. yes...it says PRO on it...but this item is a SUB PAR PRODUCT!Please note that hanging brackets are very different...and fuses are on the inside of unit! (if you smoke a fuse...you have to remove 6 screws and pull back cover... not a major issue unless your controller is 22 feet in the air!)Bottom line...this company is selling snake oil! It is a bait and switch...I would think twice about ordering any thing from them.Please Note that order was placed Apr 7th and it is still not resolved! I had to make my 5th phone call today to once again try to get a refund!We need to stand up and take the time to demand to get what we paid for...no more and NO LESS!!!
5,The Religion That's Misunderstood,"I'm coming from the view of a Muslim--living in America. I loved this movie, though it's not really much difference from other movies that show Man's greed, deception, the wanting of power, and most of all, ""the diseases of man's heart.""The most powerfulest moment of the movie was when the American Government was holding the Sheikh under charges of terrorism with the idea he was part of an Islamic Extremest Group--(which there is no such thing), so, when both leaders were in a cell right next to each other, the ""True"" Sheikh quoted the Quran and Hadith(sayings of the Prophet), which explain that the jihads weren't fought under simple or minute matters, and, in addition, it was the Prophet who received the Order from Allah; the only other authority that can declare a jihad is a Caliph under Allah""s order. And today, there is no caliph in Islam, which means that NO ONE CAN DECLARE A JIHAD.""This is the instructions for the jihad.Dawud Tijani ibn Sharifuddin"
2,Disappointing,The acting was disappointing. why would glover be found in such a movie?? The review was excellent till i watched the movie. I now was to give out the DVD.
3,I don't recall it at all,"This movie must have been boring because I can't remember it at all. It has some star power and I'm guessing a good director but, sorry! IMHO life is too short and so I watch a lot of movies, maybe too many."
3,DISAPPOINTED,I love Danny Glover but this just didn't seem something for him. Sorta boring from beginning to end. Wouldn't recommend it but if someone really wanted to watch it I wouldn't discourage it either
1,"Poorly done, and the story is even worse","After 3 minutes I knew how the movie would end. The story is so flat and full of stereotypes I could not watch for too long (skipped to end to see my assumptions about the plot being confirmed). Tons of cheap animations in the movie that I could do better on my desktop PC...I don't know what to say, I'm astonished that Amazon added such a movie and that they even charge for it...makes me thinking about changing to Netflix."
3,Good,"I chose this rating because, I did get the gest of the movie,but I was expecting a better ending. Besides theyu didn't settle their differences in this movie."
1,Biased brainwash right out of the heart of hell,"The whole movie, I'm thinking ""This movie was written by Muslims."" I no sooner saw the first credit that my suspicions were affirmed. It is a post-9/11 stream of thought to infiltrate the American mind with the seed of confusion, that we Christians serve the same God, that we are just like the Muslim, and that the Muslim terrorist is not following the will of the satanic Koran. The sad part is that they are successful. Make no mistake, we do NOT serve the same God. They serve the Moon God, who was worshiped before and during the time of Muhammed, the ""prophet"" of Allah. Compare the Bible and the Koran; they describe two completely different Gods. Those not trained in Biblical truth WILL be swayed by propaganda such as this waste of film. What a shame."
1,nothing new,I waited anxiously for the newest John Rosemond book and was very disappointed. It seems to be the same information as his books Raising a Non-Violent Child and Parent Power. I read nothing new. Parents who are already familiar with his other works won't find anything new...sadly. A big disappointment that his material is continually recycled with only a new title and cover.
4,good read,"This was an enjoyable, quick read. Women live for others and we forget ourselves, this is a pleasant reminder that we need to remember ourselves and live a little."
5,"Wonderful Read, I couldn't put it down!","Wonderful heartwarming story, marvelous characters, gripping story that has you rooting for its heroine. I did not want the book to end! I still want to know more about Lily and how her life plays out now that she has had her epiphany. The story is so good that you don't realize how full of wisdom it is until you finish it and reflect on the various characters: the long dead narcisstic mother, the dysfunctional sibling vs the ""good"" daughter, the supportive created family vs the family of origin, etc. Fantastic on all levels, and extra fun for those of us who live in CT and can relate to the local references. I can't wait for the author's next book!!!"
2,Not what you expect,"This was not at all what we expected...it did fly, but never blew bubbles, and was very messy."
4,Good for the price,"I use sanders instead of hand plane for most of woodworking,so have been using most brands on the market.I think Bosch sanding belt is not par with tool qualtiy but par with Mirka and 3M brands(those quality is a bit disappointing when considering their names) but better than SAIT and Woodstock or other cheap ones. Bosch's sanding belt has a room for improvement because it does not last long, surface clogged easily, and material removal is not fast enough.My favorite is Norton 3X and Makita, but have to pay more.Considering both price and quality factors, this one is good choice too.When you need to remove materal fast, Norton 3X is better.However, for final sanding or you want to use it once and throwing outbecause of sticky material sanding, this is a good choice."
1,Not as pictured,"Beware: The product Amazon is shipping is not what's shown in the photo -- it has a different top. Some people may prefer it (it seems to be metal), but I hate the way it looks -- it has a long thin pipe sticking out instead of the the smoother design shown."
3,Looks great,"Looks good , but may be a bit large for the vanity or shower . Otherwise , I really like it's shape."
5,Beautiful!,"I was hesitant to purchase this because of the issues brought up by other reviewers however I'm glad I did! I purchased other clear acrylic bathroom sink accessories and everything looks great together. I filled the dispenser with clear soap and it makes it look beautiful! I love that it is clear, and therefore matches everything, but it does still have some visual interest to it so it does not look boring or cheap."
4,Really good,"it is a new and bold music sytle very good, Sleepy Hollow is a great song u should listen to it"
3,A Love Story in a Mysterious Setting,"First and foremost a love story, The Ghosts of Stony Clove takes place in 1809 in the Catskill Mountains of New York. Innovative style of writing; unpredictable plot. A decent time-killer."
4,A Bargain: Four for One,"This three CD set, priced nicely, contains four albums, all remastered. ""LAMF Revisited,"" Johnny's high-end, punchy re-mix of the best ever rock and roll record; ""DTK,"" the wonderfully representative live-in-1977-when-they-ruled recording; ""Live at the Lyceum,"" which could be remastered on Mount Olympus and still be the stinkeroo it is; and ""Line and Wasted--Unplugged,"" a swell acoustic set. If you are new to Thundersian muses give this a try. If you are a completest, it can't hurt to hear these remasterings."
4,"4,5 stars Really great album",This is an album that has rarities and b-sides. I know this doesnt sounds good but believe me is like a new album. The songs are all great - a mix of ballads and psychedelic music. I personally like very very much : Buying new soul - Disappear - Albulance chasing - Even less. I believe it is a must album for Porcupine Tree fans. Really great work. Keep it up.
5,One of the best. But do not start from here,"Since I have all Porcupine Tree cds I could not miss this one even though I knew this was a collection of sparse material whihc did not make it to any of their previous album.However -and this is where a great prog band demonstrates its value- this album got under my skin. It is not an easy album so you will need to listen to it more than once, then you will discover it has its own coherent logic and structure as it had been conceived and built from the beginning where it was not. This is the most amazing things of all.Said this, I must warn that for a Porcupine Tree novice definetively this is not the best buy. Try Signify to understand them.But for all of us who love them this album is a pearl and a great basket of musical pleasure ."
3,NOT as pictured,The product i recived looked nothing like the picture shown the moss was full of sticks and small waste. Alot of it was already dead or dying beyond help.
3,"Not as pictured, but it works","The moss I received was not as pictured. It came in a shallow, round, plastic tray and was not green like shown. It was red and green mix, moreso red. It was also not in a sheet, but in little clumps about an inch in diameter each. It was, however, healthy and viable. I planted many of the little clumps in my bonsai's base dish and I'm watching it carefully, misting daily. I'm keeping the leftover I didn't use in the tray it came in, also misting daily to keep it alive in case what I put with the bonsai doesn't make it. What I've got will work, but I was expecting what I saw in the image."
4,Great for Bonsai-scaping.,"Generous amount of moss for decorating Terrariums and Bonsai dish displays. Nice color, texture and easy to handle. Doesn't dry-crumble like others I've tried."
1,Should have listened to the first review!,"I read the review that said this product was poorly made. I decided to get it anyway. How could a toy for $49.99 be all that bad? Well it is! The plastic is rickety, it tips easily and it is just not a great design. I can not recommend this. It's not even worth a fraction of the price."
1,Poor Quality,We received this item with our pampers points and it is the worst ride on I have ever seen. We had only had this product for about 3 days when the handle and seat already started to break. My 13 month old pushed up to get off on the green footrest and was thrown from it when it tipped forward. Do not waste your money. Kettler usually has great products but this is not one of them!
1,DO NOT BUY--NOT WORTH YOUR MONEY!,"The company indicates that this item would suit a 10 month and older child. This is not the case. The seat is too high for our 11 month old (average size) to even reach the floor. When secured in for the first time, he gently leaned to one side and fell over. Actually, I think he would be much safer without the belt---then a child might just fall off, instead of falling hard with the whole toy to the floor. After the fall, I decided to only let him use it when we pushed him, but that is no good either. The push bar in the back bends (not a solid piece) and is extremely difficult to manuver. The stickers were falling off right out of the box too and this item does not easily go together! The foot rest (not practical at all to use by the way) is extremely hard to snap in. Overall, not a good product. Try the Kettler little bikes---they are nice for older kids. Get something else for your little one."
2,Poor quality,"This toy is not worth $40 -$50. Very cheaply made, flimsy plastic. We kept the foot support off because our daughter can't stear it with the support on, therefore her feet drag on the floor. Not happy at all with this product."
4,atlas of the dragonlance world,This was a great purchase for the quality and the price. I would definately recommend this item to anyone to buy.
2,wild fantasy,"My husband brought home this book...we were both wild about horses from earliest age. We have 14. Scanlan seems to have a wild romantic fantasy about horses. As stated previously many of these stories have already been told. He seems mesmerized by Monty Roberts who I don't care for...so much hype. It is an ok book but was hoping for much more. And as for wild horses they are getting out of control on the range...I live there, poluting water holes and edging out other game do to the fantasy of the wild horse. Writen from a cloud. I haven't finished the book as I grew tired of his woo woo attitude."
4,An interesting mix of personal experience and equine history,"I enjoy reading about personal impressions that register in other peoples' minds as they experience their relationships with horses and gather knowledge. This book does that, with lots of factual material presented in a way that makes a great read. It is easy in this mechanized world to forget how intricately linked human history is with equines. His description of riding with a herd of wild horses on the plains of Wyoming on a pack trip made me feel like I was there! And a horse lover can never learn too much about these amazing animals! I will read it again and will recommend it to my friends!"
1,Not for me,"Just read - agree with Monika - (review written in '04 (I believe) too much tales of abuse, murder, maiming of horses for my taste. What was this author (compiler) thinking about in getting this stuff together? I wonder how many books this has really sold. I also wonder about the other reviewers who gave this five stars? Lots of info left out - something started then left hanging. ""Epic Rides"" - terrible, deplorable. Overall not a good effort. Scanlan - how much of a horse lover is he, really? Makes you wonder. Wish I could get my $15.00 back."
2,"Good chipset, bad build","I am a big fan of C-Media chipsets, however the quality from Sabrent is extremely poor. Some of the legs on the chipset were soldered together and there was corrosion on the PCI connectors. I never received a reply from Sabrent regarding getting it repaired or replaced under warranty."
5,Good sound quality for my machine.,I dont use my desktop to watch movies so I didnt bother with 5.1 or 7.1 surround. I can tell you that music sounds perfect with my 2.1 speakers and this card was a nice upgrade from the sound built into the main board.
1,terrible driver,"It was terrible.I bought it as a used.Therefore, no driver CD was attached, it was OK.The problem was that even I downloaded the latest driver(released 2009), it did not work.The driver is so weird. The driver which I got from Sabrent did not work completely for my machine.The driver which I got from C-Media worked but limited.However, the versions of the drivers were same both C-Media's driver and Sabrent driver.From the information of the box, the microchip of this soundcard should be CMI8768 but the driver recognized microchip as CMI8738 that totally different.I check the microchip itself and microchip physically printed CMI8768.Since the driver recognized my soundcard as CMI8738, I can not use 8 channel.I can use only 4 channel.I also tried older version of driver but it did not work(released 2005).My computer's OS is windows XP pro 64 bit, it is not common OS.It probably my OS is unsupported OS.So I do not know other operating system but BE CAREFUL."
4,it gets the job done,"I purchased this sound card because I was getting static through the mic on my onboard sound. I was looking for something inexpensive that would give me a clean mic input and clean sound. It has certainly worked on all accounts.Installation was easy enough, although I would recommend that you just ignore the drivers disc. It was easy enough to go online and find the drivers I needed, and after a couple reboots it was working fine.I will say that I'm not really pushing the limits of the card, I use either a pair of stereo desktop speakers with a subwoofer, or my headphones with the mic. I haven't tried setting up anything close to a 7.1 setup. Then again, that's why I wanted an inexpensive card - I wasn't going to spend $100 for a sound card to listen to through headphones!I give it four stars because of the drivers - it wasn't hard but it wasn't easy either. Overall, this card does exactly what I was looking for - a no frills sound card that gives me clean sound."
1,Piece of Garbage,"With the mixed reviews, I took a chance and bought this soundcard. When it arrived, it looked as if it was used. The teethmarks that enter the PC slot looked as if it was already put in a computer, scratches on the metal and looked rusty on the outerpart. Although it had some type of physical alterations, I decided to try and install. After 6 hours of this piece of junk not being recognized and having such a difficult time with the crappy software disc it came with, I gave up, packed it back in the box and sent it back.I saw alot of others had good experiences and thats great for them, but for me this was not a pleasant experience , hence I rate this a zero out of 10 and do not recommend buying."
4,Sabrent Sound Card,The card installed easily but had problems with the set-up until after getting the driver update.
2,"Not a bright idea, but durable.","After receiving the sign I thought it was great. Turned it on and it was nice...up close. However, after setting it up in our Sprint/Nextel business I was a little disappointed. It was not very bright from afar! Also, it didn't really fit well in our window space. I will replace this one with a vertical one that is a LOT brighter!"
2,Too Few Tips,"Disappointing. You would think that, with a title like ""Golf Magazine Top 100 Teachers..."", that there would be at least 100 tips. The total is 18 and some of them aren't particularly enlightening. There are better golf instructional DVDs for the money."
1,DON'T BUY,This ship is tiny!! Do not waste your money! Buy the Lego Black Pearl instead. Its about the same price and it's 4 times the size. This product is a rip off!!
3,Warning SWINDLE,"This ship is too small, it is not even a foot long. It is too expensive for what you'll get, I bought it at 89.99 the more than 100 USD price now is even worse, if I had time to return it and buy something else to my 4 years old kid, SANTA'S present, I'll certainly do it. This price ships usually are big enough for 3.75 inches tall action figures sold everywhere. The figures that are included are ""microfigures"" not even an inch long. There are no pictures of the box where the word ""microfigures"" can be read, and I still can't find the specs of the product where you would expect to find the size for the toy."
2,"Axel broke in first hour -- looks sturdy, but not","We built a whole birthday theme around this gift, and my son was sooooo excited and surprised. However, something in the axel broke within the first hour (on flat level grass). A crushing disappointment."
2,broke in first hour (axle),Bought as gift for son's 3rd birthday. So much excitement...that turned to unconsolable tears when axel broke in first hour (on flat lawn). Argh!! Will find out how Peg Perego handles this.
2,I didn't care for this book,"I was expecting more. This book was not that good. The story didn't hold my interest, maybe because I wasn't born yet when it takes place. I could not relate to the women at all with their guru and looseness."
3,Clever but disturbing,"Emily Jenkins is a talented writer, but I was hoping to read something funny (read: uplifting); however, this book delved into the sick area of child molestation.I ended up skimming through the book to find out who the creep/child molester/villian was.I prefer funny/zany writers like Sophie Kinsella, Confessions of a Shopaholic"
2,falsely profound and profoundly false,"About 9/11, B writes, ""At a pinch we can say that they did it, but we wished for it. . . . We are far beyond ideology and politics now. . . .As if the power bearing these towers suddenly lost all energy, all resilience; as though that arrogant power suddenly gave way under too intense an effort: the effort always to be the unique world model.""Despite the silliness of these ideas, here and there B does make an interesting point. But the book exists primarily to exhibit B's cleverness rather than to illuminate terrorism."
5,Stokowski Radio Broadcast-World Premiere of Antheil!!,"This cd is a revelation to us who are getting to know Antheil's 4th Symphony (I really enjoy it!). This is its world premiere performance, and it is very good, but with some allowances for the sound to be made. The last movement is cut though-with a almost totally different ending. I do not know if this is Stokowski's doing or perhaps Antheil revised it before publication. It is certainly very interesting to hear, although I prefer the published ending better. There is applause at the end plus the voiceover of the announcer, which I also find intriguing. The Vaughan Williams 4th is a stunner also-pity he never recorded it commercially-and it has much better sound also. This CD is recommmended for the adventurous and especially for those enjoing the renaissance of the music of George Antheil."
2,could have been on just one disc,"This tries to make a fast song out of a slow ballad. A friend of mine described it as ""very 80s."" He was right on the money. You can totally see someone dressed up like a Miami Vice character while jamming to this version. I like the b-side on this disc, but the remix is poor, but funny."
5,No doubt in my mind...5 STARS,"Gavin Degraw is a very spiritual, down to Earth artist. He speaks from his heart and lets his emotions pour as he sings like it's nothing. When I first heard one of his songs, he touched my soul deep within me. You know he's a good guy and he's endured many obsticles in life. Love is something so special that is priceless that words can't always describe. In the ""Chariot"" soundtrack, Gavin DeGraw, expresses himself really well and the words flow just right. You know he has worked hard to be where he is know, mentally and physically. He is a one of a kind original artist and deep in my heart he deserves a five!! Good luck in life!!"
2,what!,"am i the only person who thinks this album is on the verge of terrible. out of 128 reviews, the lowest rating is 3 stars?! i dont understand.the sticker on the jewel case refers to gavin as new york's best kept secret. maybe its just me but i think new york should have continued to keep its mouth shut. ive heard much better in local coffee houses."
5,Amazing!,I heard him on Carson Daly's talk show late at night one time where he sang Chariot and a cover of another song. I fell in love with his voice. I got his cd two days after it came out and have listened to it religiously ever since. It's amazing and I would highly reccomend it.
5,the ultimate album,"I heard of Gavin DeGraw by watching Pepsi Smash. He performed ""chariot"" and i needed to buy the album. I wasn't let down by this cd. It gets better with each listen, and thats hard to find in albums today. This album sounds very raw and true to the artist. J records is awesome."
5,He's about to be huge!,This album is definately just the beginning of Gavin DeGraw's career. I bought the cd when it first came out and it hasn't come out of my cd since. I've even picked up a couple more of Chariot to give as gifts this Christmas. Gavin's honesty in his lyrics prove that he has an amazing talent as songwriting as well as singing and of course playing the piano. If you haven't heard him yet now's the time. I've also seen Gavin perform live and he's amazing! Check it out! :)
5,AMAZING ALL THE WAY THROUGH !,"The music, the lyrics, the sound, Gavin's voice... everything is wonderful about this cd! Everyone should honestly own a copy - it is more than worth the money. I also went to two concerts with Gavin and his voice is just as amazing live... BUY THE CD!"
5,Gavin DeGraw....The Best!,"To anyone out there who's debating on buying this album...the debate must end now...it's a MUST have! His soulful sound and warm voice is something we need more of in the music business. He's a cross of Billy Joel, Stevie Wonders and Joey McIntyre all rolled into one...and let me say that is an outstanding combonation! I promise you will love this CD with just one listen, you won't want to stop listening to it! So go on...buy it and enjoy! :)"
4,Oh C'mon,"Okay to start, I'm not doubting that Gavin Degraw is quite the talented musician, but OH C'MON! I was reading reviews of people on here and I bet about 3/4 of them are girls who just watch MTV and don't know any good music besides this. For example, one person said this ""Another plus about Gavin is that in concert he sounds just as the CD with a little more ""umph"" to his songs. He will change notes around, hold out notes longer in concerts, but it sounds beautiful"" I'M PRETTY SURE THAT ALMOST EVERY ARTIST DOES THAT LIVE (well if they have talent...so I guess all you MTV girls do have something to get excited over, because almost all the music on MTV sucks except for like 1/100 songs). Again, I am not doubting this CD is quite good, it's just, he's not a god. He does have quite the good voice but he needs to bring out more talent in the music, it's just too poppy for me..I give it 3 1/2 stars"
5,Ahhh... This is SO GOOD.,"I actully heard, ""I Don't Want to Be"" on kind of a fluke- I was flipping through the channels and I saw a guy who looked a LOT like a guy I knew in highschool, so I stopped. Needless to say, it wasn't the guy I knew, but I listened. And it was AWESOME. So I bought the CD.I was totally blown away, esp. by the stripped CD. OKay, so maybe ""I Don't Want to Be"" and ""Chemical Party"" are better on the original, but ""Chariot"" and ""Belief"" are SO AMAZING on the stripped CD, that I think I may just like that one better. Either way, you can find something you like on one of these CDs. If you want to just relax or scream the song at the top of your lungs, driving down the road, or even just cry your eyes out, it's all here."
5,It's About Time Good Music Came Around,"I used to be a teeny bopper in the worst sense of the word. I didn't listen to anything that hadn't been surgically enhanced by the studio. But Gavin Degraw's Stripped set is finally an indication to myself that studios don't have to do the work if the artist is truly talented. This is probably the best album I've heard in a long time and I'm really surprised radio and MTV haven't picked it up for some heavy rotation. In the same breath, I'm glad they haven't because then he'd become the product of overplay. The acoustic set is amazing, and although the studio version is incredible, Stripped is what reminds you of what music should be like. ""Follow Through"" is a stand out and ""I don't want to be"" sounds much more like a song instead of t.v show theme without all the studio work in it. This is definitely worth your money."
5,This is a great collection,"I can listen to this over and over again and rarely get tired of it.And the nicest thing about it is that there is no one song that I wantto skip. I like them all.Thanks, Gavin!"
5,"""Chariot"" is by far the bst CD I have purchased in a while!","Every song on this CD is amazing. I cannot say enough about Gavin! He is to talented to put into words. He is music's new piano man. I am addicted to the CD, I have been listening to nothing but ""Chariot"" since Tuesday! I highly recommend it! If you love DMB, John Mayer, David Gray, you will love Gavin!~Tara C.~"
5,MY FAVORITE ALBUM EVER,"This CD is so amazing...Everyone should have this one. Gavin is such a great performer, and he does not disappoint as a recorded artist either. If you've never heard or seen Gavin play....YOU'RE MISSING OUT~ I can't choose a favorite song...the whole album is just awesome~!"
5,AWESOME! Best New Artist in Years!,"This is what we have all been waiting for! Interesting music, beautiful voice, honest lyrics. This is singing in its purest form. No special effects..just Gavin at his best. This is music you can enjoy. Sit back and relax and let the music wash over you!"
3,eh..,"Good singer, but the melody is all the same! Change it up a little bit please. If it werent for they lyrics, it would be like listening to the same song over and over again. I love you Gavin, but please dont make your songs sound all the same."
1,did somebody owe his Dad a favor?,"Sorry people, this album is barely listenable. I got it based on the catchy single ""I Don't Wanna Be"" thinking it may have some merit or at least a couple more good tracks. Apparently I was sadly mistaken. On first listen I thought it really can't be this bad, can it? So I played it again, and a third time. It just got worse. The lyrics are inane - the only comparison I can draw is that he is the male version of Ashlee Simpson. It's kinda like a movie that looks great based on the trailers, only to find out that you've already seen all the good parts on the commercial. Do yourself a favor - DL the song (or God forbid, songs) you like, and spend your money on a real singer-songwriter like Jason Mraz or Ben Harper."
4,What!,"I love Gavin Degraw ,but he could have done a better job & I'm sad to say this is not classic enough for me although he hassome great tracks."
5,best ever,"This cd is absolutely AMAZING!!! Most cd's that i have owned for over a year hardly get played, but not this one....it still is and will be one that i listen to all the time. The songs on this album are all powerful and something that you can really connect to. Gavin's music is awesome--you won't be disappointed with this cd! happy listening!"
3,Ummm???,"Gavin Degraw is an interesting artist to say the least. This album was okay but not good enough to recieve 5 stars There are 3 or 4 songs that a good and mainly the rest are okay ,but the lyrics for some of them were pointless and confusing. I hated Chemical Party!!! Other than that I would just keep listening for his songs on the radio or borrow the CD from a friend."
3,Good one,"Is The fisrt time i've listen something about DeGraw and i like a lot the melody of the CD including the variations in the Stripped one, but there is one thing that disappointed me and was the letter of the songs, i think these were too simple, i mean instead of Matt Nathanson or John Mayer. But in general, it doesn't dislike me."
5,Musical Genius!,"This album is truly genious. Degraw has truly poured his heart and soul into this album. I'm not a soft-rock kind of girl but this album has changed my mind. This is how I know this is a exhibits greatness-because transcends beyond genre. I truly enjoyed all of the song on the album and would recommend it to anyone, regardless of what kind of music they are accustomed to. My ultimate favorites are1. More than Anytime2. Belief3. Just Friends4. I Don't Want to Be"
5,Amazing!,"Gavin Degraw is an amazing and soulful singer/songwriter. His CD is one that you can listen to from start to finish, without skipping tracks - now how often does that happen. His CD has not left my CD player since it was released. His words are real and his soulful voice captures you. If you haven't seen him live yet, I strongly suggest you get out to one of his concerts. There isn't a song on the CD that I don't LOVE. Personally, I feel Gavin isn't getting the exposure he deserves, but I guess good things come to those who wait...I'm waiting. He is above and beyond the ""Next Big Thing"". He is truly amazing. If you haven't bought this CD now, GET IT! You'll want to keep this one in your collection for years to come - because this won't be his only album!"
5,One of the best....,"Gavin Degraw's album Chariot is the best album i own. I first heard about Gavin on the WB's show One Tree Hill. I was instantly hooked to his voice. I went to a concert and to my surprise he was the guest. After hearing him singing live i had to buy the album, the album was better than i thought it would be! This IS a must have album for every one!"
5,I luv Gavin Degraw,For xmas i got a certigicate for 20$ for a C.D and i didnt know what to get and as every1 should no that one tree hill's( my fav show)theme song is dont want to be by gavin degraw i loved it sooooooo much i bought the c.d only knowin the 1 song but now i lov them all.
4,What an album!,This album has it all! Gavin has all the right notes and each song is better then the last. This is an amazing CD by an amazing singer and song writer.
4,Solid CD... very unique sound and diverse range of tracks.,"This year has been a good year for new, young artists and Gavin Degraw is no exception. Little bit Pop, heavy dose of Blues (and R&B;), and a shade of Rock give him a great sound. He sounds strangely like ""Stevie Wonder"" on some tracks, but given how great of a musician Stevie is, that's certainly not a bad thing. The track ""Chemical Party"" is a little bit out there, but it's not horrible (growing on me, slightly).I'm by no means a musical officianado, but I know what I like... and I like Gavin.Other artists/groups I enjoy (rather eclectic):- Keane (NEW for me),- Jamie Cullum (NEW for me),- David Gray,- John Mayer,- Dave Matthews Band,- Linkin Park,- 3 Doors Down (most recent CD),- Train,- Coldplay,- Dido- Norah Jones- Seal- StingHope that helps. Give Gavin a shot! :-)"
5,Wow!! Gavin will blow your mind!,"This album is all that I hoped for and more! If you like soulful ,powerful vocal stylings, Gavin will not disappoint. Chariot takes some of the best selections from Gavin's repertoire and reworks them in classic Gavin style. Some of my personal favorites are ""Just Friends"" & ""More Than Anyone"" both of which really showcase Gavin's musical prowess. Keep your eyes on this one folks, because he's about to blow up!!!!"
4,"Gavin DeGraw, ""Chariot""","On his J Records debut, Gavin DeGraw does not disappoint. He's a talented singer and songwriter. His style and charisma fits well in the contemporary music scene. It's a shame that DeGraw was largely overlooked until the inclusion of ""I Don't Wanna Be"" on the One Tree Hill television series soundtrack.Originally released in 2003, Chariot showcases DeGraw's ability to transform lyrics into musically imagery and inspire emotion among fans and radio listeners alike. From start to finish, the 11 tracks contained on Chariot are exceptional. Stand out selections include ""Follow Through,"" ""I Don't Want to Be,"" ""Chariot,"" and ""Just Friends.""Check out Gavin DeGraw on tour. He's even more brilliant live.If you are a fan of Gavin DeGraw, you may also like Jason Mraz and John Mayer."
5,i don't even have the albulm and i know its a beast,"i don't even own the fricken albulm and i can just tell its awesome. as soon as i heard i dont wanna be i knew this kid was goin to be awesome, so i made 1 of my friends buy it. trust me. buy the cd."
4,Rare Surprise and Necessity,"I'll admit it. I first heard Gavin DeGraw's song, ""I Don't Want To Be"" as the theme song for the WB's ""One Tree Hill."" The song piqued my curiousity and I decided to investigate who sung the theme song I began to love so much. I came to Amazon.com and began to read and listen to other samples of Gavin's CD. Before I knew it, I was addicted. To add fuel to the fire, I saw Gavin on Sharon Osbourne and fell even more in love with this passionate and talented singer. (Okay, he's pretty cute too...)When I first listened to the entire CD, I really thought, this guy is going to be big. Not like John Mayer or any of that posse, but big like Billy Joel. The piano moves as well as DeGraw does vocally and lyrically. If you have fifteen dollars, go out and buy this CD. If you don't, borrow fifteen dollars and buy this CD. It's worth the price to listen to the rarity and treasure found in his words, song, and music."
5,I can't play anything else,"Ever since I purchased this CD I can't play anything else, is so good Im addicted to it. I bought it when I was pregnant and now that I've had my baby is what I sing to him. We love it! Gavin is so talented! My advice to anyone who is considering getting this CD is, DO IT, you won't regret it!"
5,Great product!,I love Gavin Degraw and this album is amazing. The stripped bonus cd lets you hear Gavin at a raw level. You can hear the passion for music he has...it's awesome.
4,Great cd,I think i will download this cd because i dont feel like paying for it but when its all said and done this cd it great
5,Real talent! Amazing!,"This album is quite possibly the best debut album that i have ever had the pleasure of hearing. Gavin DeGraw has an amazing voice that mixes smooth soul sounds with a raspy edge and an amazing range. In addition to being blessed with vocal abilities, Gavin tears up the piano and guitar in 11 original songs that are reminiscent of a young Billy Joel with a little extra kick. From the softer pop sounds of the first track, ""Follow Through,"" to the rough-edged guitar chords in ""Chemical Party,"" each song has its own sound, mixed with the signature style of New York's biggest little club act, Gavin DeGraw."
5,Oohh Chariot!!!,"As the lyrics say in the song ""Ohh Chariot"" this is a great CD. Degraw has a very Billy Joel young urban rock voice, that really stands out from the crowd. His lyrics are very interesting and thought provoking, comparable to Jack Johnsons' songs. Chariot is a mellow CD with some great thoughts and messages interlaced through lyrics and his AWESOME piano playing skills. This is an excellent CD, that compliments other singer/songwriters such as John Mayer, Dave Matthews, Jack Johnson, Jason Mraz and even Liz Phair."
4,"Great Voice, great album",Gavin DeGraw is a talented guy. I am enjoying his CD and recommend it if you are into a more mellow relaxed sound. 2 thumbs up.
5,Quality.,"I've always loved the songs I had heard on the radio and I can't beleive I didn't buy this sooner. While Gavin may not be #1 in the charts he deserves the rave reviews he gets. He is an original, not cookie-cutter artist. Great blend of upbeat and low-key songs. Well written and proformed. Gavin went for quality here-This cd doest have the filler songs you will skip over like so many of the mainstream ""artists"" out there. If you just want fun but shallow music-this cd isn't for you."
5,Real Talent!!!,"I have listened to this CD non-stop since I bought it, and it never gets old. Gavin's voice is so unique (both literally and figuratively). It can be soothing (as in the ballads on the album) yet he can also totally ROCK. I have been telling everyone to BUY this album! You will not be disappointed!!!"
4,Best New Artist,"This is a really great CD. I saw Gavin live on tour with Jason Mraz a few weeks before the release and i went the next day to pre order Chariot. He has a great stage presence and his voice and songwriting abilities will take him far in the music industry. His music is like a mixture of pete yorn, jason mraz, and rufus wainwright, with a touch of elton john's instrumental arrangement. its difficult to describe and i would recommend this cd to anyone who likes great songwriting and incredible raw talent."
3,Eh...,"Gavin DeGraw's ""Chariot"" is just an okay album. He has mad pianoskills, but he writes the dopiest lyrics and has a somewhat nasally voice. I'm not the biggest fan of Gavin, and I don't know if I reccomend this or not. The few standout tracks are:-I Don't Want To Be-Chariot-Follow Through-Belief-Just FriendsWhatever you decide, I hope you make a good choice with this album. Hey, I don't know.Sincerely,Darren CatoAmazon nickname ""total_rebel"""
5,Sweet Chariot Indeed,"Gavin Degraw is an amazing artist!!!!. I wish I could give him 10 stars. He is the type that does not come around very often. He writes his own lyrics...that are not just ""catchy but true to life. From his song about the beauty of life called Chariot to the comical Chemical Party. He is a great musician, who is great live. His performances capture the whole crowd. He has over 200 reviews on amazon alone and the critics have to admit he is a freash face in music. People pick up and listen to his cd....by the time you finish you will be a Gavin Degraw fan for life :-)"
4,New Guy Rocker Rocks,"John Mayer, Jason Mraz, Rob Thomas, Josh Kelly.... You like those guys, you'll love this. ""Follow Through"" should be a smash! Other standouts are Chariot, Just Friends, and Crush. This is Clive Davis' very own John Mayer so you know the label effort will be strong. A great voice with great melodic tunes and no too much edge to turn you off - it pop/rock at it's best."
2,Gavin DeGraw - Chariot,"Well, not really good actually. There are only a few songs that worth listening. They are Chariot, Follow Through and I Don't Wanna Be. The rest just didn't work for me. They just arent catchy at all. However, if you're a fan of Gavin, Then buy this album. 'Cause i bet he put lots of effort into it, and being a bad album to me doesn't mean a bad one to you. So guys, you may give it a try. Maybe listening to sample before buying:)."
5,You will never hear a voice so powerful.,"Gavin DeGraw is a man with a wealth of talent. His debut album, Chariot, layers beautiful, flowing piano music over rasping, soaring vocals. Chariot is a mix of Billy Joel and John Mayer, R&B, soul, pop, and love songs. I dare you to listen to this album and *not* find yourself tapping your feet and bopping your head. I promise you all, this man has a gift and you're missing out of something really beautiful if you don't listen."
2,Lost my attention after the intro.,"I ordered this recording with great anticipation, but now that I've listened to it, I must admit to being very disappointed overall. The fanfare that Sargent uses to introduce the work is quite frankly the most interesting part of the entire piece, and I say this as a devotee of Handel's choral works. Dull, dull dull. Give me Gardiner's rendition anyday."
5,Andes tradition,"Elizabeth B. Jenkins is a fine writer, but most of all a great Andes-, or Inka teacher.This tradition is a Path with energetic workings which you can feel through your whole body and mind.Elizabeth, thanks sharing..."
2,an american tourist in peru,"This is a superficial and at times naive account by a yet another starry eyed, eager and willing ""shaman's apprentice"". Elizabeth Jenkins worked as an English teacher in Cuzco when she met a ""fourth level"" shaman, Juan Nunez, who showed her around Peru. Juan immediately initiated her into the fourth level herself. The apparent ease and efficiency of this ""initiation"" process has, if i am allowed to be slightly cynical, allowed Elizabeth and Juan to create a major business catering to those who are looking to get something for nothing. About 20 times a year, Juan initiates yet another group of wide eyed tourists, and both E. and J. lead initiation workshops all over the world, including the US.This book will be of interest to people who are inclined towards safe ""spiritual adventures"". I would not recommend it to people who are looking for more resources on shamanic ""technology"", initiation or peruvian beliefs."
3,Theory is not best practice,"I bought this book expecting to find examples of new ideas developed recently by businesses that are considered at the top level related to assets management.What I found was an excellent summary of all the textbooks used in college for the last 40 years. I could even find a chart we used in class in 1972.Best Practices in Inventory management must include links to Manufacturing strategies, postponement of production to delay costs, improve flexibility for lower number of SKU's.I find the title pretty ambitious but not enough ""meat""."
5,Great Approach To A Many-Times-Told Tale,"This is a fine account of the Wright Brothers' lives and achievements. It reads easily, and sets correct some of the myths that have grown around Wilbur and Orville (such as the vignette about building the little sled).And I really liked the line in the Preface (...) stating that this particular biography wasn't going to delve into an extensive exploration of the Wright Brothers' ancestry, that some brief information about their family history was going to be presented in the first few paragraphs, and could easily be skipped by the reader. That's definitely my kind of biographer."
4,A good source of info - no one book has had the complete story,This book takes the story of the Wright Brothers through the later years and is worth reading.I have found that the single best book on the Wrights may be THE BISHOPS BOYS by Tom Crouch or TO CONQUER THE AIR by James Tobin.Each of many books gives the reader a different perspective on the invention of the airplane and the effort by some to discredit the Wrights. As an engineer I found that reading the papers of the wright brothers indispensable in truly appreciating the engineering genius of the wright brothers work. I have summed up my findings on a web site devoted to the subject which discusses the development of their propeller and motor as well. you can visit it at www. wrightsfly.infoRoland BoucherCalifornia Professional Engineer #6094
3,The Wright Brothers Long Ordeal,"This is a very detailed chronology of the Wright Brothers massive achievement to create a flying machine. It details each stage of development and incorporates the other individuals that were both helpful and damaging to the development and eventual recognition world wide of their accomplishments. It is a slow read but very satisfying since you appreciate the enormous difficulties they endured to achieve what we take for granted now - safe, frequent, air travel.I read this at same time that I read the biography of Alex G Bell by Charlotte Gray which serves as a great contrast in life styles and creative follow through. While both the telephone and airplane define modern life, the achievement of the airplane is orders of magnitude more complex than the telephone."
3,Great toy - but WAY too expensive - buy at Toys R Us instead!,"My son loves these. They each make a different noise, and they are just the right size for him to pick up - but not too easy to pick up, so he can work on his motor skills. [...]"
5,What fun!!!!!!,"These were purchased as a gift for my 9 month old daughter. She loves them! She can shake them and hear cymbals crashing and all kinds of different sounds. I think they are a little better than the Peek-A-Blocks, even thogh they are still a good toy as well. Great purchase!"
5,"love em, but amazon is overpriced","we love these balls, they roll easily, make interesting sounds and have small parts inside to focus on, they teach case and effect and baby loves them!!!as with most fisher price items amazon is wayyyyyy over priced. they're listed for 1/3 the cost at toys r us"
4,Sounds like fun,"My 7 month old son recently got this set as a gift. While he struggles picking up the balls, he has great fun rolling them all over the floor and he enjoys all the sounds each ball makes. It is always great for me to see him enjoying Fisher-Price toys as I grew up with Fisher-Price too."
2,So What?,"""So what?"" seems to be my son's attitude towards the roll-arounds. Honestly, I'm not even sure why I bought them. He has similarly sized balls that came with the Fisher-Price Fishbowl ... when playing with them without the fishbowl, all he does is put them in his mouth. Not very educational if you ask me."
5,Pleasantly surprised. A quality film.,"Perhaps the intensity of this film was easier to take on the small screen than it was in the theater. I thought it was well acted and flowed well from beginning to end. The characters moved both geographically and developmentally which helped to keep my interest. The ending was bizare, but believable given the twisted upbringing of the brother; a mixture of good and bad. The heart is a place which is large enough to house a fearful mixture of both pure love and pure hate, and who can say which will have supremisy in the end? His journey is not over by a long shot. I can see this showing up in the future on tv. It should hit a chord with almost every age group; the struggle we all have to make sense of the world, the unfortunate situations in which we all find ourselves at times, and the emotions those situations invoke in us."
2,"A dour bummer, plus boring","Big stars in this downbeat tale, but it never takes off. The depressing stuff is piled on so thick, I actually laughed: not a good sign. Charlize Theron, Woody Harrelson and Dennis Hopper just can't rescue this oddly lame picture. The 13-yr-old girl who stars has one expression: blank. Boring."
1,Awful...,This film is so bad!....I love Annasophia Robb but I still couldn't get through this incredibly boring movie!
2,Nightmare,"What a loser this movie turned out to be. I don't know why Charlize Theron is even shown on the cover, she's not in it much.The movie is a low budget sleeper. It doesn't have enough of a plot to go anywhere. It drags on and on. The characters are boring. I also have a problem with child actors who smoke. I don't care if its for a role or not, it is unacceptable!Don't even waste your time renting this dud."
2,I fell asleep,Maybe not the best review because I didn't actually watch the full thing. I fell asleep and didn't even know where in the movie when I tried to watch it again the next day.
1,nasa apollo missions,the dvd had potential. but my version was in poor shape. i tried cleaning the dvd. it paused and skipped in areas. the dvd potential was good. if the quality would've been better!!! there were good areas that saved it. i would've paid more for a professional version if one was available. i am conspiratorial and checking the possibilities that we did not go to the moon. the dvd did help in some areas. i wonder if the dvd was altered. i have seen other versions with bigger view??? i will look for a better copy.
3,half moon,"Luna stumbled on this one. The first three albums were wonderful. As a Galaxie 500 fan from way back I was relieved that Wareham continued to record decent music (I've never listened to music made by the other two thirds of G500). But on Pup Tent Mr. Wareham seemed to have temporarily run out of ideas, both musical and lyrical. This isn't a bad album; it's just not up to Luna's standards. I miss Stanley Demeski's driving beats (which propelled the Feelies so compellingly) and found the production on this CD to be rather flat. A CD for completists only."
2,My first impression was Yuk!,"At first glance I felt that this book was a real waste of my money. I am trying to improve my caricaturing skills and this book was more about cartooning than caricaturing. It was instructional when it came to exageration of details and a few other neccessary pointers, but did it teach me how to caricature anyone? Not anyone I know! It's good reading if you want to know about the author and general information about the history of caricaturing, and so forth. If you want to learn how to draw caricatures, as I do, then I don't think this book will help you very much."
3,Full Moon Madness,"Another example from the brilliantly warped mind of Charles Band. An assassin clown, devious midget, rock girls in a cage, a powerbent dominatrix and of course a shrunken head madman. Add all those ingredients and it's another Full Moon picture. Oh, and did I forget the three killer dolls? All Full Moon fans need this DVD."
3,BLOOD DOLLS,"Full Moon Pictures brings you a film that has a deadly assassin who wears facepaint like a clown, a midget, an all-girl rock and roll band in a cage, a sexy dominatrix, a man who wears a mask to hide his shrunken head, and three killer dolls...it's BLOOD DOLLS! This twisted movie tells the story of Virgil Travis, a multi-millionaire who has created three little dolls that have deadly features (The Pimp, Miss Fortune, and Sideshow) to kill anyone who gets in the way of his plans for wealth and power. BLOOD DOLLS has serious ""midnight movie"" potential written all over it, and any horror fan should pick this one up today. The DVD edition comes with a behind-the-scenes featurette, a documentary on the making of the film, a music video, a theatrical trailer, and a blooper reel."
1,This movie gotta be one of the worse out there,"i dont know if these people are giving it good reviews just to get rid of there copy of this movie!!! But from one horror fan to the next, please dont waste your time on this stupid movie. it should have never been made and youll be much happy without it"
1,"A Rolling, Flaming Ball of Garbage","I tend to write reviews of movies, CDs, etc., only when I have very strong feelings on the subject. I just watched this movie and was astounded by the large number and wide variety of bad ideas packed into it. I didn't know a movie could have this much action and yet be so boring. It's 85 minutes long, but it seemed like 85 hours. I didn't know that such bad actors could get star billing. You learn something new every day. Please don't make the same mistake I did, a mistake you will regret for the rest of your life. Get a different movie."
3,AMERICA'S CRITIC,"I THINK I HAD HIGHER EXPECTATIONS FOR THIS ONE SINCE I WAS LITTLE I LOVED WATCHING THE PUPPET MASTER,,, THIS ONE FALLS SHORT TO DOLL SIZE,,, ITS A LIL LOW BUDGET BUT I THINK THEY COULD OF DONE ALOT BETTER THAN THIS ON THIS FILM,,, IT IS A 1 TIME WATCHER. BUT MAY BE WORTH THE TIME FOR A LATE NIGHT FLICK WITH YA CHICK."
4,a great horror/humor combo,"This one went surprisingly deep on the philosophical banter between the protagonist and antagonist. But it was no mere head-to-head talkie. The music was astonishingly good, the suspenseful action lent a continuing air of suspension and tension that gave you the creeps, and the script was a twist if Nietzsche meets the Twilight Zone. The babes were hot and sassy and the relationships complicated like the taste a well aged wine. If you don't like this movie, you probably don't like to have fun with horror and should seek your thrills in more somber chillers. The clown! William Burns brought levels of sophistication to his role. His character was a spiritual man, you see. The story's message might offend the devoutly religious. Too bad. Hidden talent showed up in this yarn. The girl band coulda been a contender. The lead actress in the movie leaves you begging for more. Literally."
2,NOT GOOD,"NOW, I LOVE BAD HORROR MOVIES. I REALLY LIKE FULL MOON MOVIES. SO, I WAS VERY EXCITED TO SEE THIS. MISTAKE. THE BAND IS GOOD BUT THIS MOVIE IS BAD AND NOT IN A GOOD WAY. EVERYTHING SEEMS TO BE DONE FOR THE SAKE OF BEING WEIRD INSTEAD OF TO FURTHER THE MOVIE. IF THIS IS THE DIRECTION MY BELOVED FULL MOON IS GOING, I AM IN TROUBLE!!!! THERE IS ALWAYS SUBSPECIES THOUGH."
5,Handy little reference guide,I am new to the world of flower remedies and this has been a valuble guide for me.I am able to reference this book frequently.
5,Excellent Book!,"I teach at the college level on The Biblical Role of Men and Women. I found this book to be well written, and life changing to the people in my class. Highly recommended to all wanting to know how in the world that Jesus---The Prince of Peace---ever allowed his followers to become abused or abusers! HE DIDN'T! Violence is NEVER allowed! Get a copy of it, and the other books that speak against the misuse of Headship in relationships."
4,Historical tidbits presented in dramatic fashion,"I remember listening to Paul Harvey's ""Rest of the Story"" radio bits in the seventies. They were always entertaining and a frequent topic of discussion among the members of the construction crew that I was the foreman of. When one came on the radio, we competed to determine what the ""rest of the story"" would be. While we would occasionally get one right, the vast majority of the time we were nowhere close.There are 101 entries in this book and I found all of them well worth reading. Once I started, I could not put it down, finishing it in one sitting. It is one of those rare books, easy, entertaining and educational."
3,Useful but beware of typos,"As other reviewers have noted, this book has a huge collection of design/analysis formulas for various transmission line structures. This is the good news. The bad news is that there are quite a large number of typographical errors in the book. For example at least one of the loss equations is missing a factor of PI. It is still a useful book, but it is important to refer to the references given for each section to double check that equations have been transcribed correctly.In all fairness to the author, this may have been a book publisher issue and I have found other texts and papers in this general area to have similar issues (missing squared terms, wavelengths that belong in the denominator appearing in the numerator, etc). I think the moral of the story is you have to really watch what equations you actually use."
5,Good Book,"The book gives good insight into all the issues regarding marketing High Technology. If one were to think of interfaces, the Marketing <-> Customer interface is explained quite well. However, the interaction between Enginering and Marketing is not discussed in depth. Nonetheless it is a good read."
3,"Good, but somewhat outdated","This well written book is a good source of classic high tech marketing principles. You should realize before buying that the book is 20 years old. There are many outdated statistics and anecdotes (and interesting prognostications) that while true at the time, seem a little irrelevant today. I found the history of the marketing strategy in the computer processor industry of the 70's and 80's to be fascinating. In the end, though, I wished I had looked at the copyright date of the book before purchasing."
3,good but a bit dated,"Some interesting ideas for marketing high technology but the book is from the mid-80's so it's a bit dated. Naturally, being from the 80's there is no reference to the Internet. That's an issue since it's such a huge part of marketing now."
2,Lacks Substance,"William Davidow has great organization in this book, but beyond the big picture, it lacks real substance. I could have taken this book, created an outline from just the chapter and section headings, and got as much out of it as I did reading the whole thing.I recommend this book to the beginner in technology and marketing, but not to anyone with any real experience in either."
4,Classic!,"Who can disagree that this is a classic...One of the earlier reviewers rightly pointed out that this book does not address the marketing and engineering interaction. There is a terrific book that is just out, called ""It's not about the technology"" by Karamchedu that talks exclusively about this aspect. I recommend reading Karamchedu's book along with this Davidow's classic."
1,Horrible Series!!,"I wanted to get some Sci Fi material and then I came up with these series I'd heard about on Coast to Coast. The stories are very badly written, the cast is terrible and totally unappealing, the production is cheap ...so my advise is: Don't waste your money in this nonsense and get the X-files, The Ray Bradbury Show or even the Twilight Zone from the eighties which are way better than this. I still don't understand why the producers of the show picked these actors for the series. They are not only bad actors but they don't have the slightest trace of charisma. Then the dialogues are aweful and the situations around the main story are ridiculous. I paid $7.50 for this set and I feel like I was ripped off. Oh, I forgot ...with all this CGI technology we have now these guys still use rubber models and cheap make up. It seems that we're looking Sci Fi from the eithies or even seventies. That's sad."
2,A pretty package with no substance,"The publisher deserves credit for putting together an attractive little book. The short quotes sprinkled through out are pithy and to the point, while the decorative illustrations are pretty. Those illustrations, however are the flowery type you find in Asian poetry books and have little to do with Wabi Sabi. Gold's exposition on the subject is simplistic to the point of being juvenile. Wabi Sabi is a complex topic and requires more depth. While new to the subject, I have already found two better books. Lennox Tierney includes photographs of items which actually illustrate the principles of Wabi Sabi in Wabi Sabi A New Look at Japanese Design. Wabi Sabi for Artists, Designers, Poets & Philosophers by Leonard Koren Porvides a better foundation for understanding than Gold's book."
2,Pleasant But Hollow,"For those already aware of Buddhist or New Age principles, this book might serve as a pleasant reinforcement. If you seek a deeper truth, you'll be disappointed by the cooing stories of the author's grandmother. The ideas, like accepting what is and living in the moment, are sound in my experience, but the presentation strikes me as infantile. A luxurious use of ink and space make for an attractive book, suitable for a coffee table or waiting room."
2,Not recommended for students of Wabi Sabi,"I'm a long time fan of ""Wabi Sabi for artists and designers"" and a new fan of ""the Wabi Sabi House"" so I thought this would be along the same lines.Actually it seems to be a new age self-help book full of self obsessed California psycho-babble. If you are a lost soul needing support and guidance this may be a great book for you. If you are a designer or architect looking for guidance in bringing more authenticity, grit, and poetry to your creative process then pass this one by."
5,Fantastic book about real Wabi Sabi,"This is the best book I've read about Wabi Sabi, and I refer to it often. It covers the history of Wabi Sabi in Japanese culture, its evolution, and explains the fundamental principles of Wabi Sabi for a happier, less stressed life. I keep this book on my nightstand and re-read a bit from it each night. The easy explanations and positive, inspirational thoughts are always encouraging. I also enjoyOpen Your Mind, Open Your Life: A Book of Eastern Wisdom (Large Second Volume)and the fantasticWhat Is Love? A Simple Guide to Romantic Happinessby the same author."
1,Its not what you think,This is a book you will want to give to grandma. This book is written as journal with second rate art. This book has nothing to do with home decor. The cover is the best part!(My grandmother is dead so I have no use for it!)
3,Spoken word only.,There is no music on this set. ONLY SPOKEN WORD. I never actually listened to any of the discs so I can't comment on the content.
5,Great boogie.,I have listened to this CD dozens of times and it never fails to give me a lift. If you think boogie-woogie is old hat try this.
1,JUNK SCIENCE,"None of the 'guards' had training or experiences as guards, and none of the 'prisoners' had any experiences as prisoners; everyone was acting how they imagined prisoners and guards should act.The book is a disappointment."
2,behaviorism,"If people understood the principles of reinforcement and punishment, there should be no surprise that people can be taught new behaviors in a short amount of time. The more important thing is how to change these innapropriate behaviors on a large scale."
5,My First Psychology Book,"Well, i can't say that my reason for buying this book is the most convincing. However, going on a 10-hours flight requires a good book to read. And Zimbardo doesn't disappoint. My girl friend majored in Psychology, so this book serves on many levels.Its an easy read, and it really doesn't challenge those of us (me in particular) who have absolutely no background in psychology.The price is just right! the book with free shipment is less than 13$ which is 6$ less than the cheapest price i found in any bookstore. Even with shipment fees for standard shipment which was 16.24$ is still equal or less than most bookstores out there.One last thing not related directly to this book, is that the delivery was really fast. My order was placed on Sunday, Standard Shipment, and i recieved the package on Tuesday. Not bad at all!"
5,Sulpheric!,"I'm evil, and I've been that way all my life. Frankly, it's a heckuva' a lot of fun - you have a lot more sex and make a lot more money and the meek move out of your way like the scurrying cockroaches that they are - so to all you good people who've come to the dark side, I can only say, ""welcome aboard!"""
5,We truly are sheep,"On Being in the Role of Prisoner:""Jerry-5486: The most apparent thing that I noticed was how most of the people in this study derive their sense of identity and well-being from their immediate surroundings rather than from within themselves, and that's why they broke down--just couldn't stand the pressure--they had nothing within them to hold up against all of this"" (pg. 186).On Good and Bad Guards:""Guard Geoff Landry: When a prisoner gives you a glassy stare, and mumbles inaudibly, you almost have to perceive the worst. It's almost because you fear that the worst will happen. It's almost as if I accepted it would happen, and the slightest indication of anxiety and breakdown is the beginning of the worst possible effects"" (pg. 188).(A Guard on Forcing a Prisoner to Eat):""I decided to force feed him, but he wouldn't eat. I let the food slide down his face. I didn't believe it was me doing it. I hated myself for making him eat but I hated him more for not eating"" (pg 191)."
4,Fascinating Study of Human Behavior,"This book provides an in-depth study of the Stanford Prison Experiment and of the factors that allowed the abuses at Abu Ghraib prison, and ties them together neatly. Fascinating read for anyone interested in human behavior. The book got bogged down somewhat in its analysis of the politics that led to the abuses at Abu, but was overall an insightful study of how something like that can still happen."
4,The Stanford Prison Experiment and Onward to Others,"Well worth the read just to recapture the fascination of the students involved in the Staford Experiment. In 1971 I was new to college and later heard of the experiment in class lectures. The reactions of the student prisoners and guards, even down to the despondency and controlling behaviors that emerged, was intriguing. The Stanford Prison Experiment has now taken its place as a psychological and sociological cornerstone.Disaster after disaster is addressed, all having the thread of decent people succumbing to psychological situations. Results are dire in each. Excellent discussion on tendencies of social scientists' to explain poor behaviors on personality traits, while underestimating the situational forces at play."
5,Paperback,This arrived within the specified time. . .looks brand new and I recommend it to those who like to learn and expand their horizons.
3,didn't finish reading yet,"It is good so far. I just dont like that there now is another book titled ""Why good people do bad things."" I guess I'll have to read that also."
2,"is it evil to call this book ""garbage""?","If so than I'm the devil himself...bwah ha ha ha haaaa...but really, this book was junk. Very boring for a psych book. I think the writer's head got a little too big from the attention he received from his prison experiment and he goes through every excruciating detail of it in this enormous book. I frankly think that his experiment was a sham in that he began it under false presumtions. False presumtions = false results. Since his life's work has largely been dedicated to the results of this experiment, it must say sadly, it's been a life wasted. Furthermore, this guy gets people believing that this experiment is something groundbreaking and should compel the prisons to change. Although prisons need to change in many areas, this author does not have any more of a clue than your average citizen."
4,Worth the (not easy) read,"This book reads as if the author likes to hear himself talk using big words just for the sake of his own ego. Although I cannot know if that is truly the case, it makes for an unnecessarily difficult read. That being said, it is worth the read. The information that Zimbardo is communicating is valuable. It's just too bad that his editor let him down."
5,The truth about good and evil,"The Lucifer Effect is eye-opening. It shows how average people, under the right circumstances, can commit evil deeds and believe they are on the ""good"" side. Phillip Zimbardo shows how dehumanization is the major cause of evil acts, and how it can corrupt human beings. Definitely recommended for people who are trying to learn the origin of evil."
4,Interesting,Dr. Zimbardo's account of the Stanford Prison Experiment is very interesting and applied across a variety of circumstances. The story becomes a little repetitive at times but is easy to skim through.
3,Wonderful Insights Dreadfully Presented,"Zimbardo begins each chapter by telling the reader what he intends to say. Then he says it, mixing in frequent reminders of things he said in earlier chapters. Then he tells the reader what he just said, and adds what he plans to say in the succeeding chapter. The result is maddening, especially since the ideas he presents are both interesting and enlightening.Zimbardo's research and analysis clearly show how systemic and situational factors lead ordinary people to behave badly, and the application of his classic Stanford Prison Experiment to the situation that developed at Abu Ghraib sheds a great deal of light on the abuse of prisoners by members of the United States Military. It would have been better accomplished, though, in half the number of pages. Random House really should assign much better editors to Zimbardo's next project."
4,good book,I bought it for my granddaughter for her psychology class. I cannot assess it anymore as I am not going tp read it.
4,Modern day evil,"Even though I am going through a Doctoral program where this book is required reading, it is a must read if one wants a basic understanding of evil in our modern world."
4,"yes Moreno, no Marina","I waited for this cd for over 1.5 yrs.to be shipped directly from Amazon but it never materialized. Finally I ordered it used from an associated seller.Always liked Moreno's playing-truly gypsy, virtuosic and inspired, although overwhelming at times. There is more gypsy in Moreno than jazz, which is great, but occasionally form ovepowers content and one wishes for musicality more varied and refined.As for Marina-her singing is in that 2nd rate restourant gypsy tradition, which is called ""gypsyishness"" in our neck of the woods, meaning a pseudo gypsy sound resplendid with habitual manerisms and lacking in authenticity and vibe.Overall, the meeting of east and west in gypsy tradition did not register as success, but it surely was fun and pleasure to listen to.-"
4,further proof that alt.country is the best music there is.,"caught the band on ""austin city limits""; looked everywhere for the cd. finally, found it and now can't get the songs out of my head. probably the only thing better than the cd would be a live show."
2,Wrong disc!,This item was not the same I wanted. I was lead to believe that it was the deluxe 2 disc edition end it wasn't.
5,Harken perfection,"This is one of the best album of all time, period. It's a mostly-undiscovered gem, a genre-busting masterpiece, an amazing leap in production and songwriting from previous efforts. If you're a newer fan you'll be blown away by the raw, naked lyrics of Rhett and the band's solid old skool country roots...yet the record is not country, or pop, or rock, or anything else conviently tagged. It's the ninety-sevs at the absolute top of their game: they got pop-ier, they got more polished, but they were never better than Timebomb.If you buy this and hate it: email me. I'll buy it off you - serious - and maybe school you a little in the process, punk. trick_rope@yahoo"
5,"My life was misspent, please don't let me be misunderstood.","When two of my friends who had never met, both introduced me to this album, I assumed they'd become friends upon meeting. I was right. I bought this album for myself after a roadtrip to Mexico with one of the friends who introduced me to the Old 97's. I don't leave home without this CD, and I travel weekly. I know it's definitely in my top 5 albums of all time -- most likely higher, but the only one that will never leave that category. I'm a fan of their other albums as well, but this one is the '59 Cadillac with perfect chrome and the supermodel in the passenger's seat."
5,Best of the 90's,"From the opening of ""Time Bomb"" to the closing of ""4 Leaf Clover"" there is simply nothing resembling a bad tune on this disc (though ""Broadway"" comes closest). I've owned this cd for a few years now, and it has served many times as the soundtrack to my life. The lyrics range from poignant and sad to hilarious (often at the same time). The music perfectly conveys every emotion expressed and creates countless others. I have simply not purchased a better album in a long long time. Buy this. That way you can say the same thing."
3,"interesting research, no practicality","I was hoping for a book that was highly practical for the classroom. This book, however, relies heavily on research.Because the rest of the world is more advanced in bilingual education than the United States, most of the examples were from Europe and Asia.This is a sequel to another book, so there are several references to the first book.Several chapters would be good for teacher education classes. A few chapters would be excellent for linguistics classes.I was disappointed by much of the book, so I wouldn't recommend it, as a whole."
2,"Not feeling it actually, , , , , , Didn't care for these boots.","Didn't care for these boots, built well but a major opertation to get on and off, way too narrow at the top and the zipper on the side doesn't help much and in opinion should have been put in the front, might be all it would take to make this go on and off easier. Not an expert but have wore them ocassional for the last two winters and would not buy them again.This is my story and I'm sticking to it!"
2,vita-mix cookbook video,"The only problem with this video, as it was informative, was that the last owner had used the tape to record cartoons in the middle of the tape. I was able to fast-forward to view the end of the tape, but I am disappointed with that. - JoAnne"
3,"Not bad, wish there was more choice.","In college Latin there is really only two choices for texts. A Majority of teachers use the old reliable Wheelok's Latin, while a growing minority use Orberg. My school used Orberg. Orberg is helpful for learning the ""Natural Method"" and he really does get one to think, however, sometimes it is hard to understand what is going on. the lack of english definitions makes it hard sometimes to learn what he wants you to learn. Also, forget about the Grammatica Latina. unless you are fairly fluent, it is hard to figure out what it says. Hopefully you have a great teacher, because if you have to rely mostly on the book, you won't go far."
1,This book made me learn to hate Latin,"Not really sure where to begin. First off, the lack of understanding the author creates when it comes to the grammar is beyond frustrating. When I took Latin using this book, it was the end of the 1st semester when I learned that there were things like Nominative, Accusative, Genitive, etc. It was frustrating enough not knowing what these words meant in English, but in Latin...forget it. Secondly, sometimes the pictures were not that clear. The only thing that saved this book from receiving 0 stars (besides the fact that you can't give it 0 stars) was the hilarious picture on page 299."
4,The Wedding Samba,"These are truly happy songs that I heard as a child and never knew where they were derived. My family couldn't tell us until we watched ""A Good Year"". This is an album of pure fun."
1,Extremely dissatified customer,"I received a defective product from the seller that did not work as advertise. I contacted the seller for an exchange, which they aggreed to ship, but they never shipped a new replacement cable. I am currently disputing the charges with the creditcard company I made the purchase with."
4,Good replacement for a key ring,"It is easy to open and close, I do have a little concern that over the life of the product it might become too easy to open or close and spill the content, but it seems to be secure for now."
5,Handy!!,Works just as described. No need to worry about keys falling out. Easy to open and close clasp to add and remove keys. Wish I would have known about these sooner.
2,"Used it, then tossed it.","They're kind of cool, and work ok, but if jostled the wrong way in your pocket or bag, and they can come undone. The screw on type are much better."
2,I must be dumb...,"I just received this key ring by mail and have now spent 20 minutes trying to figure out how to open it. I can't get it to move in any direction. Granted, I am a senior citizen with limited hand strength and some arthritis, but the other reviews all made it sound so simple. I also might mention that I am a college graduate and have had considerable success in my life figuring things out. Help, help."
1,Lame,"First off, I intentionally ordered the blue one. They sent me a red one anyway. Second, the thing stinks. It's pretty stiff, so it's not very comfortable in my pocket. Third, it doesn't snap closed. I tend to play with my keys in my pocket and this thing kept opening up so I'd have loose keys in my pocket. If you leave it alone, it'll work fine, but it wasn't working for me."
3,Worth the buy,"I got one for myself, but it rather came apart quickly (a loose end), but i WILL be buying it again as i fell in love with its minimalism and its sturdiness."
4,So far so good,"At first I couldn't figure out how to open this. You squeeze the two sides inward toward each other and it pops open.I have not had it pop open accidentally and I don't see how it could happen unless you somehow accidentally squeeze the sides inward. This is stiff and takes some deliberate squeezing to get the sides to bend inward so hopefully it will stay shut.The one I got is blue like in the picture. It's a nice thing and is much easier to open than any keychain I've ever had, which is why I got it. I park at places with valet parking a lot and was tired of struggling to get my car key off my keychain. This will solve that problem. I recommend this."
4,Should last,"The cable used to make this keyring should last forever. I'm not so sure about the plastic coating. I gave this 4 stars because of the price. They should be able to sell a product like this for $1.00 and still make money. However, the price includes shipping, and that is more expensive than lots of the products nowadays. This should last a lifetime if the materials are of good quality. I'll revisit this review if I spot a problem. For now, I can recommend the keyring."
4,Keyring,This does the job! It seems pretty secure as it requires a bit of manipulating to undo the clasp. I had to use it to attach a key-fob to my keychain.
4,Great Key Holder,"OK. $3.52 is pricey for a key ring. But it's so much better than the standard steel rings. Easy to get keys on and off, flexible and holds many keys. It's not hard and bulky in your pocket and it won't come unfastened on accident."
3,perfect except for the color...,"yeah. I got a pink one. It's kind of a hot pink color. Definitely not red. Otherwise, it's exactly what I'd hoped for."
2,Comes apart too often,"Pros:It's easy to open and close.It's blue, which is a nice color.Cons:It's easy to open and close. So easy, in fact, that the thing can come open by itself. At first, this won't happen too often, but it seems to get worse as time goes by. After a few months, you may find that spilling your keys all over the place will become a daily occurrence. It did for me, anyway, and let me tell you: hunting around on the ground at night in a dark parking lot trying to find where all your keys went gets old pretty quickly.My recommendation is to get the 81101 model instead; while opening it is slightly trickier (but not that bad, once you get used to it), it's *far* more secure."
5,Best alternative keyring available - Don't buy the 81101 model,"It takes some getting used to both opening and closing; especially once it is loaded up.The process is far less cumbersome than the traditional ring style, and more secure than any other alternative. This thing absolutely will not open on its own. It will only open when you want it to.The twisting motion makes more sense once you have it open the initial time and see how the mechanism works. Then it is just a matter of using it.Great, simple, effective design.NOTE: There is another model 81101 that is smaller and FAR more difficult to open, especially when loaded. I made the mistake of ordering one of those for a family member, and as I tried to use it realized what all the complaints were about.Definitely get the 71101, it is easy to open and stays securely closed."
2,Dont expect the color you want and wont last for more than a couple of months,"This is now the 2nd order I have placed for these after the first one I go just broke. The stock photo shows blue, but apparently they come in ""assorted"" colors and now for the second time in a row Amazon sent me a pink one. The first one I had lasted about 4 months and it broke at the ""locking"" point. The wire simply came out of male metal part of the clip. However for $3.48 I figured I would give it a 2nd chance. Will keep you posted..."
4,misrepresented color - good product,title of the review says it all!! would have been 5 stars except I ordered it because I wanted a blue one - instead I got black.
1,BORING,"I purchased this CD as a present for my wife, who is a major Jonilover. I saw her for the first time at Bethel,NY (Day in the Garden), and it sent chills down my spine. Unfortunately, this recording was extremely boring, both from a jazz perspective ( I'm a jazz drummer), and from a Joni perspective. I found that Joni herself is more ""jazzier"" than ""Jazz Takes"" will ever be. I've heard jazz interpretations of so-called popular music that were much better than this i.e. Joshua Redman- Timeless Tales (which incidentally covers Joni's ""I Had a King"" from her really early recordings. Stick to the real article here! Incidentally, both my wife and I agreed that this recording wasn't good enough to keep, and sold it to a local used CD store."
3,"Maybe for jazz fans, but not so much for Joni fans.","As a big fan of Joni Mitchell, I had high hopes for this CD -- maybe _too_ high. It's much more ""jazz"" than it is ""Joni.""When I thought of jazz and Joni combined, I imagined something like _Hejira_ or _Miles of Aisles_: Joni's songs with jazz inflections added. Somehow, extended vibraphone solos and such don't say ""Joni Mitchell"" to me. She is all about style _and_ substance; these renditions change the style and lose the substance.Good advice for anyone considering buying music online from a site such as Amazon: listen to some of the samples they provide from each album! Had I listened to samples of this album, I probably wouldn't have spent the money.(Sorry to sound so negative from my purely Joni-based perspective. The performances on this album sound quite competent, and if you're a jazz fan, you'll probably enjoy it!)"
1,"Bad, Bad, Interpretation","This is an extremely lathargic and unspired CD. Joni Mitchell music is taken here VERY literally, which doesn't fare well, even in this particular jazz setting. The arrangements are extremely simplistic (except ""Edith and the Kingpin"" but the meter here is way too slow to the point of non-recognition of the material on which it is based), and the playing is strangely pedestrian and uninspired. And sparse -- like there were only two or three instruments in the room. And Thomas Chapin's flute solo on ""Coyote"" has a lot of ""wrong"" notes in it. The whole effort is kinda Joni Paint by Number music. A must, I'm afraid, to avoid.However, all is not lost in this peculiar sub-genre. For a truly inspired jazz interpretation of a great composer, check out ""Color and Light: Jazz Sketches of Sondheim"". It's just terrific."
5,Astral Chillout,"""Nirvana Cafe"" is a great CD of ambient electronic music for anytime listening. I recommend it for creative work, meditation, yoga, dance warm-up, healing work and environment enhancing. It would also be good for a low key party or dinner. It's very groovy and chill, with lots of neat sounds. There isn't really any singing on the CD, it's all instrumental with a couple short, sparse chants. It could be described as New Age, space or star-gazing music, world music as well. It's an interesting listen."
2,The worst of Karunesh,"When I first bought Zen Breakfast I was very pleased, great music for studying, reading or just chilling out. I was so satisfied that I bought two more disks from Karunesh, those were ""Joy of Life"" and ""Call of The Mystic"". They were great too. Actually my favorite is Joy of Life. I've been studying for a very demanding exam this past 6 months, the only thing that gets me studying is Karunesh...I was so happy with my studying music that I decided to buy another disk from them, it was Nirvana Cafe... total disaster, horrible instruments kept disturbing my mind while studying. So I decided to just erase it from my playlist.I totally recommend Karunesh, it's the best, but not Nirvana Cafe."
4,A familiar - and pleasing - sound,"The first thing that came to mind when I was listening to this music is that it sounds an awful lot like recent Mike Oldfield - which is just great, because I loved Tres Lunas and The Songs of Distant Earth. If you did, too, then you'll probably like Nirvana Cafe."
2,Spills ink inside the printer,"I am all for saving a buck, so when I saw that the Rhinotek ink cartridges were cheaper than Canon, I immediately figured Canon was just overcharging. However, I do think there is a quality difference. When I opened my printer to check what cartridges I needed to buy, I noticed yellow ink in the gears and covering parts of the inside of my printer. My first thought was - this is a mess. My second thought was - Is this why I need to replace the cartridge already? I have no idea how much ink leaked out, but it should not happen at all. I had a Canon black cartridge, which seems to have outlived its Rhinotek color counterpart, even though I mostly print in black only. Given that Canon cartridges are marginally more expensive, I'll stick with them from now on. Sometimes saving a buck costs you more."
3,"Great bag, not so great stitching","I love the size and features of this bag, however the stitching to the key ring torn apart the first day I used it, and after 2 weeks of use the side elastic that is supposed to keep bottles, etc has also come unstitched. Very disappointed in this aspect of the bag but like the size and function so well will repair it myself. I got this on-sale which is a good thing because for the full retail price I cannot believe they would sell bags with poor attention to details like this."
3,Not very light-hearted!,Not a bad romance though I found it way to predictable. I am used to being able to predict stories but this one I saw everything coming to the point that I found it boring.It did do a good job dealing with Alcoholism and co-dependency though which I thought was interesting in a romance story.I guess my biggest disappointment is that I usually like romance stories to also make me laugh and enjoy the writing.
4,Ziggy's second best CD,"I don't think any of Ziggy's albums quite match up with his first one (""Conscious Party"") but this one is probably the 2nd best. There are some really fun songs on here, especially ""People Get Ready"" ""Born To Be Lively"" ""Brotherly Sisterly Love"" and my favorite, ""Postman."" When I first heard ""Postman"" I couldn't believe how much Ziggy sounded like his father. After reading the liner notes, it turns out that Steven Marley (not Ziggy) did the lead vocals on that one. ""Postman"" alone is worth the few dollars I paid for this CD. Although some of the songs on here are pretty lame, the good songs are stellar and make the CD worth having."
3,Hayward DE4820 pool filter,The product received was not as shown on your website. I had to buy the valve shown on the picture which did not come with the product. I have an email by one of your associates claiming the the product shipped would be as shown.Your rules are that the complete product must be shown. Big booboo
2,Shame,"The beats are weak, the lyrics are weak. DJ Babu is alright on this album. I only liked the song with Evidence."
5,FREAKIN AWESOME!,"This is the best Motorhead compliation out there. It contains all the classics and very little filler. Unfortunately, Motorhead has released some great songs since (""I Don't Believe a Word"", Deaf Forever"", ""Devils"", Living In the Past"", Orgasmatron"", Love Me Forever"") so those gems will not be found here. That said, this is the starting point for any Motorhead or heavy metal fan."
3,no remorse II,"I have to agree with the low star guy. I have this on cassett and it is quite differentin the songs. They are the same titles but some of them are live, To Late To late to name one.If I did not already have this set I would get The Best of Motorhead. It has many more songs or the after Killed by Death area."
2,buyer beware!,"This dvd transfer has no English subtitles. That fact is not stated in this ad.The Beta and VHS transfers have subtitles. Too bad, this is a great film by a fine director.History's Reviewer"
2,Frustratingly verbose,"Chambers seems to cover the required material for Mac OS 10.3 OK, but he could have said it in less than half of the 692 pages if he kept his all-to-frequent attempts to be entertaining out of the book.Example: "". . . drag the default bar at the bottom of the window to the toolbar at the top. This is the toolbar equivalent of tapping your ruby slippers together three times and repeating, 'There's no place like home.'"" (p.-175). He carries on like this to the point of distraction.I would recommend two other books: Easy Mac OS X, v10.3 Panther 2004 (288 pages) by Kate Binder - much more clear than Chambers, and has lots of screen shots to show how to set up and use OS X. The second book, Mac OS X Panther Unleashed 2004 (1673 pages) by John & William C. Ray - delves into technical details, but also covers all the information non-technical users need."
3,"""What's this! Hush Hush on Hush Hush?","I've seen many things change in Chicago, the end of Maxwell Street as itwas a hub for people to mingle and exchange, but not putting the last cutof Siegel Schwall Band's first album on ""The Wooden Nickel Years"" is todeprive people of a glimpse of what the Siegel Schwall Band was like live.It is somewhat like the fish needing a bicycle argument, or needing thisalbum, sucking people in on a promise, how carney is that? Even vulturesmust gag sometime!"
1,nothing special,nothing like I expected same as any other sweatshirt-- no personal attention other than sarcasm from email-- at least I will get a refund as they stated
5,scandinavians do rule,"This second outing of this group simply tops the first one eventhough I thought they would have a hard time topping themselves. The sound is more intimate and less drum'n bass, thanks to more involvement by Bugge. Very hip but very subtle. Highly recommended and worth every import price tag."
5,"In a word, CEWBEAGAPPIC","As the title of the album states: complex, easy, white, black, electronic, acoustic, groovy, ambient, programmed, played, improvised, composed, and so much more! It is a great cd to just sit and chill to. Thanks to D-Nice @ Moods music for intruducing me to such a great album."
4,A Pleasant New Discovery,"I just returned from this year's Toronto Jazz Festival and found out about this group in the Festival Guide. After reading a review of the group's music and sound,I was definitely intriqued. I found a copy of their latest and was pleasantly blown away. All the descriptions of their sound are true. They are simply a unique and eclectic group that deserves wide recognition. I would've given this release 5 stars except that I found the lyrics odd (subject matter-wise) though they are sung extremely well. Beate (the singer)has a great voice and is a very confident singer. If you're looking for something new, check this out. You won't be disappointed."
5,A thoughtful and provocative way to pray,"Joyce Rupp continues to astonish me with her assertive honesty toward the Holy and her vulnerable honesty about herself. She puts into words what many of us don't even know we long for. I am very grateful that it was recommended to ,e."
5,Prayers to Sophia,"Beautiful poetry and a great companion to The Star in my Heart. Joyce Rupp envokes peace and calmness through her writings, which makes for great daily meditation."
1,Sophia who?,"Joyce Rupp is obviously writing about the worship and prayer to another dead ""saint"" of Roman Catholics. Practicing necromancy is a gross sin. Necromancy = communication with the dead).No true Christian would pray to anyone but God through Jesus Christ."
3,Assorted,"This album get's 3 and a half stars. En Vogue's first attempt at working with new producers is a great idea. The only problem is that they may have chosen the wrong producers to work with (with the exception of Organized Noize.) EV3's standout tracks are ""Whatever"" produced by Babyface, ""Don't Let Go (Love)"" by Organized Noize, ""Too Gone, Too Long"" by David Foster and ""Damn I Wanna Be Your Lover"" by Ivan Matias. While a good idea to branch out and try working with new producers, some of the producers were unable to capture what En Vogue is capable of and result in producing less than outstanding tracks for the group. Long time producers Foster/McElroy didn't produce as well as they're capable of either.EV3 - a must have for En Vogue fans. Should En Vogue work with other producers in the future, they should make sure to choose eminent producer's (Organized Noize, DarkChild, P. Diddy, Missy Elliot, David Foster, The Neptunes...)"
2,Pretty Average,This Album Seemed Too Be More Factory Produced than Actually Made.it was Missing Strong Words&Music.EN Vouge seems Vocally a bit Lost on this Disc.COmpared too their first two discs this one is very Average at best.They are the best Female Vocal Group over the Past Decade Hands Down but this Material here puts them in the pack instead of Leading.Having Heard the New song their's Hope they will get back to form.
5,En Vouge is the ''BOMB'',I like the way that thay came back after thay lost a person out the group and still sounds beter than ever. i think this is their best album to date. i hope the next one will be better. And if yall read this just now that I LOVE yall.
5,one of the best cd's I have,"This is one of the best cd's in my collection! i love the song ""don't let go (love)"", and the other songs are really good too!"
3,A Mixed Bag,"EV3 is something of a mixed bag. Like most artists in their genre, En Vogue can only be as good as their (producer's) material, and the quality of the songs on the album is quite erratic. ""Don't Let Go,"" is a soulful gem and the county tinged, acoustic guitar driven ""Right Direction,"" finds the group successfully exploring new sounds. Unfortuately, for every good track on the album there is an equally bad one. Babyface's ""Whatever"" doen't let En Vogue show off its trademark harmonizing and soaring vocals enough, and as a result the track sounds generic. Even more disappointing is ""Too Gone, Too Long,"" which sounds so much like mainstream white-pop that Wilson Phillips could have sung it. But the biggest low is the preachy and horribly bland ""Eyes of A Child,"" making one wonder what the producers were thinking when they put it on the record. For new listeners and casual fans, Funky Divas would be a far better investment."
5,En Vogue is awesome,"I love these girls. They have soul, spirit and talent. All the songs on the album are beautiful and catchy. They end the album with a wonderful acapella style song, with no music. Which displays their ability to sing well. Definately worth listening to."
4,A great intro for someone who doesn't listen to Trance,"Not being familiar with trance at all, I was hesitant at purchasing this albumn, but now I'm glad I did. The tracks are upbeat and flow together well."
3,Exciting&#65533;but daunting&#65533;projects,"For those who want to get into ""building"" mosaics-concrete slabs and 3-D objects d'art-this book tells all. It's for serious commercial mosaicists rather than weekend crafters, hobbyists, or even full-time crafters. The materials are expensive; the equipment, cumbersome. You need a large workshop for many of these projects. In addition, the work is kind of-well, ugly! It's filled with complicated but dull geometrics in discordant colors. Chavarria's book has been in a box to be returned since it was given to me months ago on my birthday. I have decided to keep it on the off chance I get some commercial commissions. Then it might be a handy reference."
2,messy and ugly,"The reason I don't give this book a one-star rating is because it does have comprehensive information on various kinds of stone (you don't see that very much), tools and a bit of interesting laying technique. And I give him credit for attempting mosaics on three-dimensional sculpted objects, though to my taste they are dreadful, and he does give a fairly good overview on bases and adhesives. But the projects? Is horrendous too strong of a word?"
5,Great Mystery,"Ngaio Marsh has been one of my favorite authors ever since I first read ""Artists in Crime"" thirty-five years ago. This is one of the best of them."
2,Wetter than the original one,"I bought this product two months ago. It works, but it's wetter than the original Canon BCI-24B. Some characters don't look so solid as printed by the original one (actually, the original one is so perfect that the effect is even close to a laser printer if you only print some text in grayscale). Considering the price does not make much difference, I'd buy the original one next time."
2,Not as good as I thought,I gave it 4 stars at first but have since carefully watched my printouts and every single one has smeared..and that's just with the black ink. I refuse to try the colored after this. I guess you get what you pay for.
3,Poor drawings,"This book could be the greatest book in my bookshelf, but the detail drawings are so basic and naive that it's valuable almost only for the essays. I mean... I bought a book where I expected to find good and useful details, and got a book with excelent essays about construction according to the masters (from Lutyens to Morphosis). That's why I gave it 3 stars instead of the 5 the title deserved."
4,Let me take you on a journey..,"This book is a collection of dreams, I have had for over 10 years ranging from the highly sexual to extremely violent dreams which are graphic and sometimes very bizarre.It is in no way a psychological evaluation of the dreams but I am sure, it would be open to such critique, if so desired.The comments after each dream attempts to explain why the dream may have originated and offers an insight into a 'normal' dreamer's psyche."
1,disappointed,"This is not at all what I remember. I had the LP of, supposedly, this workout. It came with a book showing the exercises and I did it daily for a couple years. I thought this was the same workout done on video. Not even the music is familiar. The exercises are so fast I hardly think they would recommended them these days. I have quite a few Jane Fonda workout tapes and have enjoyed them all. This is not what I remember and I'm sorry I wasted my money on it."
5,best results to firm muscles,"I had the original 33 1/3 record of this workout that became scratched and ,of course, outdated. I have the book, but I enjoy hearing and seeing. I've been looking fo a video for a long time. It is the best muscle firming exercises ever! Our son used the abdominal exercises in the Marine's basic training and called some ""the Jane Fondas"""
4,"An Oldie, but Goodie",It's an old VHS workout video that's in great condition. Jane Fonda's workout is still effective nearly 30 years later!
5,The Classic 1982 Workout Video,"Fonda energized America and introduced the ""Workout"" to millions. Not mention help create the fledging Home Video Market. There are DVD versions available, just search google or yahoo for ""1982 Workout"" and you'll find one. The quality is VHS-like at the best, but until the real release comes, it's the best we got. Okay now Stretch!"
4,2nd time around,"I worked out to this very video at least 2 decades ago and committed myself to it 3 days a week for 6 months, determined to keep up with these skinny, leotard wearing contortionists. While not believing anyone could actually do it, I did! I also found I had transformed my body into a leaner, more flexible me. Now, I am trying it again at the age of 50. I once again find this group of exercise-aholics a little freakish, I know this video works. Although after using several, more modern exercise gurus techniques, I do wish Jane had used weights for some of the exercises. But I've discovered that she seemed to have been in the forefront on some exercises that other's now use. Keep with it, it does work and works every major area. You definitely will see results in your hips, waist and thighs. Just give it time."
1,garbage,This video has a bad spot about 2-3 minutes into the tape. Have contacted both amazon.com and fruitabooks but have not recieved any refund.
1,Not a SAFE tape to do,"Janes does many streches and she BOUNCES. Thats a no-no these days. Now a days, its static stretches that are in. The aerobics portion is maybe 3 minutes, in beginner and advanced classes. The arm work uses no weights and mainly works your shoulders. The ab routine is probly the only good part of the tape. Dont waste your time trying to find this tape.there are many better tapes out there."
4,'Quick' - and meant it ...,"Although I tend to think of myself as a 'charasmatic' writer, I think that the resume examples used in this book were a little mundane for my taste. Of course, I am a bit on the 'animated' side of the spectrum. So, as usual, I sought to find a page where a person like myself could write a resume that would be dynamic, but not label myself a 'nutcase' to the prospective employer.I skimmed through the front of the book a couple of times. Information I already knew. But, this book (whether they have a chapter titled ""For those of you with Bipolar disorders) will be a very handy refence book. It was the first recommendation given to me by many 'a' source! Tons of different resume examples - as well as cover letter's, 'Thank you' letters, and all the goodies we will most likely forget."
3,"Bob Ryder is a blob, otherwise it's ok","The documentary was slow paced and therefore feels boring, though overall the heart of the story was good. I felt they should have interviewed more guys and made more cuts to it. Then again, there really is no sense in trying to make an epic documentary about the pile of trash that was early TNA. Trust me, I watched every single one of those weekly pieces of crap. If you were expecting a WWE level production here... remember what you are watching.The real problem however is that you cringe everytime you have to look at Bob Ryder. Why would you ever put him on camera?!? I have never seen such a thick roll of fat like his that hangs from his face and completely covers his neck. It's just... I can't describe... I remember when Bob used to sell ECW tapes and pack them with grocery store receipts. So I know exactly how he got that face...On top of this you are treated to seeing Cheex again as if I wasn't just healing the scars from when I first saw it 9 years ago..."
5,Outstanding book,"This is an outstanding, thoughtful, and thoroughly delightful memoir. I assign it to university students in a class on the history of water."
2,Kameradschaft,The film would have been a good film except for and the subtitles were unreadable because you can hardly see them
4,I just love his music!!!,"I just wanted to say that his music is great and that he has a wonderful voice. It is so hard to find his songs on the Internet and I want to find this one song that is my husbands and I wedding song. It has the words that goes something like I will, I can, I do. If anyone knows what it's called please e-mail me at annmarie91@hotmail.com. Thank you!"
2,Not exactly your pink drumming bunny,"Bought this one about 8 months ago to replace an older headset. I primarily used them to play WoW and to listen to music on the computer. When I lead my raids I need my raiders to hear me clearly and this headset worked to fill my needs for a time. Both the inbound and outbound sound worked great up until the headset it the 6 month mark. First the mic started getting really quiet, forcing me to turn up my outbound to max and my raiders to amplify me over Ventrillo. A week after that the microphone would either not catch any sound at all or only produce high pitched screeching when I talked.The comfy earphones still work for my medium sized head, but the mic is now dead.PROS: Nice Sound, Comfy Fit for Extended Periods of UseCONS: Short Microphone Lifespan"
5,Budget Power Wash,"This is a great electric pressure washer. I used it to remove old paint from a deck and mildew from my home's siding. It took a while, but I was very pleased with the results. It had just enough power not to splinter the wood, and still do an adequate job of removing the paint. You can purchase other attachments on their website to make it more functional. I'm using it to power wash everything now, from my truck to the gas grill. I am very pleased with it."
1,"Karcher is junk, customer service nonexistent","I bought a Karcher and it failed in the first year. Used the Rapid Replacement Program, and the replacement has now failed, too. Customer service is impossible to reach. I could sink more money into this, or throw it out and go with a defferent brand. Based on the lack of service I have seen so far, and the number of other bad reviews on Karcher products, I prefer the latter. Hard to believe Karcher can stay in business with such a lousy product and incredibly little regard for their customers. Don't buy a Karcher!"
2,Check out other products,"if you are willling to have the product fail after limited use over 3 years, buy it. While the motor continued to work flawlessly, the plastic parts started failing the first year. Super machine when it works."
1,i only used it 3 times-AND IT FAILED TO WORK AGAIN,"So we got this a little later in the season. We used it once. The next season we got it out, and used it twice during that season. when we went to use it again it would NOT WORK AT ALL. I would think that something should be durable enough to last more than 3 times. I had someone look at it (more money) and they could not get it to work either. What a waste of money!! I don't care if you use something 1-2 times a year, if it breaks after the 3rd use and it costs that much, THEY SHOULD FIX/REPLACE IT! I cant buy karcher again, because I dont have money to just throw out a window or burn!!!!"
5,A wonderful Christmas story,As I read this book I felt a part of the family as they went to visit their Christmas tree. I loved the warm feeling it gave me. I read it to my adult friends at a small Christmas gathering and they loved it also.
4,A Wonderful Look at Family Traditions,"As an elementary literacy coach I found this book to be a wonderful addition to my December booklist. This story tells the tale of one family's Christmas Eve tradition of placing food on and around a special tree in the forest each year for the animals. Beautiful illustrations add to the story. This book lends itself to discussion of other family traditions. I used it with all elementary grade levels and we made food for the birds to be hung in the trees around our playground, wrote class and individual poems, and the upper grades wrote personnal narratives about their family traditions. A great way also for parents to think about a family tradition of their own."
5,Great read for kids!!!,Great book!! My son loved it! Excellent condition!!!! And it came very quickly. We read it that night in front of a fire and my son wanted to read it over and over
5,Simple and fun,"These balls have been a consistent favorite of my son's. He loves to bat and chase them (crawling after them), shake them and study them. He has thrown them, rolled them and banged them. Although they haven't broken and seem really durable, they do get cloudy from all the abuse."
3,"Made in China, but visually interesting...get a lower price!","I was disappointed to find that these looked like trinkets mass-produced in China and worried about the small parts inside each ball. However, they are visually appealing. They are just the right size to grasp and crawl after. Note to buyers: don't satisfy profit-takers -- I found this for significantly less $$ at Toys-R-Us website, same for other roll-a-round sets. We especially like the touch-&-tickle-rounds, seem to be of better quality. Also look for Playskool busy balls, sets of 5 for under $10."
3,Great for little hands!,These are great for little ones. My son is 8 months old but really doesn't play with them all that much but every baby is different. I do like that they are easy for him to pick up with one hand. They just don't keep his attention for very long.
3,Worth the money???,"Broken handle on delivery. I returned it and spent a little more money to get a better quality bag. While I believe that it is worth $30, something more durable is a better choice for me."
4,Better than a bump on the head,The original lift supports in my 2000 Grand Cherokee were failing. These replacement parts were easy to install and perform well. Well worth the price. Now I don't worry about getting clonked on the head by a heavy liftgate!
5,Does exactly what I hoped!,"I gambled and only ordered one for my 2002 Jeep Grand Cherokee, figuring I could remove both originals and test each to see which was failing and only replace that one. Well, with both removed, they both had more than enough pressure for me to figure out how to test them. If I had to do it again, I'd remove one, test the pressure on the door with only one, then reinstall the first, remove the second and test the one that was removed first. So I didn't think about that at the time & just decided to replace one at random. It did the trick, door works perfect. This replacement does appear to be a little longer than stock, which makes starting the second mounting bolt easy to cross-thread or not start at all. As other people have commented, you can work around this easily by simply having a second person to lift the door to full extension. Simply propping the door up with a ladder or board will not do. Good luck!"
5,Great Replacement,"Very easy to install, just need a few tools, it is possible to install solo just hold the gate up with your other hand. Replace both at the same time just like your socks."
3,INCORRECT Information on year of JEEP,"LOVE AMAZON incorrect Parts, HAD to RETURN, NO TROUBLE, FREE RETURN, NO HASSLE, FAST PAPER WORK,FAST REFUND, REORDERED CORRECT YEAR PARTS, HOPE THIS is CORRECT on PARTS."
5,Great,"Arrived on time, easy to install and door no longer bleeds down and bumps my head. Should have done it long ago"
5,Great product,I can't believe I paid $120 for the auto shop to replace my hood lift support. Very easy to install and came very quickly. Just make sure you have a set of star bits. I used a hex wrench and it was a pain but it worked.
5,Wow,Works great. Very easy to install. Your hatch will open quickly and with some force... Try not to lose a tooth.
5,Completely satisfied.,This product was easy to install (make sure you have the right tool tip). I had no trouble rotating the shaft to orient left/right sides. Make sure you have something like a board to prop up the tailgate ALL the way up. So much nicer to have these than a bump on your head...
5,Liftgate support 99 Jeep Cherokee Sport,Easy installation. excellent replacement for 99 Jeep Cherokee Sport. Extremely fast shipping and great packaging. Easy to read instructions for different mounting options right on packaging.
5,2001 Jeep Cherokee..,This was an excellent buy for my 2001 Grand Jeep Cherokee. Cost way less than going to a dealer ship!! My mechanic only needed 5 minutes to pop them in. Well worth the price!!
4,So far so good,Just put them on this weekend and they seem to work just fine. They were fairly easy to install but a bit tricky to avoid stripping the threads on the bottom bolt. My friend who is a mechanic even had a little trouble doing it when I asked for help.
2,"Rip off product, horribly junky","I used to be an optician, and I am appalled by the poor quality of this item. At most it must've cost about ten cents to make. With shipping this will run you about $20.00......it isn't worth it. Take my word for it.But there doesn't seem to be much of a choice in this sort of reader that's of decent quality."
1,Cheap Chinese plastic junk.,This is an other example of cheap Chinese plastic junk passed as a useful item. It is particularly sad that such rip off is perpetrated on those who can not see well.
1,Fake reviews,"All positive reviews on this item are fake. See how they all seem to have ""real names"" but have only one review on Amazon. And see how the positive reviews contrast with the negative reviews."
1,Don't Order This Product,"For goodness sake stay away from this product. It is a piece of junk. Mine arrived broken which is not surprising because the magnifier part of the product is just cheap, thin plastic film with wavy lines in it to produce the magnification. One could easily punch a finger through it using very light pressure. The frame is extremely light weight plastic and the legs would not open completely. When I opened the package, a very strong odor of what smelled like mold hit my nose. I am allergic to molds and my fingers and face started itching immediately. I admit to a certain amount of accountability here since I should have been smart enough to stay away from a ""As Seen on TV"" product but the glowing description roped me in since it looked as though the product would fill the bill for my close in craft work. Wrong. This product has an even poorer quality then I would have expected. Don't order it."
1,Should have heeded the reviews!,"I am almost ashamed to admit that I purchased this magnifier against the advise of the reviewers. It is of very poor quality and should be sold in a ""Dollar Store"". In fact, a dollar would be asking too much for it. I cannot believe that Amazon would even be associated with this product."
5,Great for macular degeneration,"The product is not the highest quality construction, but it has been a tremendous help to my mother who has lost her reading ability to macular degeneration. The light combined with magnifier has made it possible for her to read mail and small print again. Well worth the purchase!"
4,A watch I can read without my glasses,I am pleased with the watch - I can actually see this easily - even without my glasses. The lighted dial is convenient in dim/dark areas. I think the strap is not particularly attractive and will probably replace shortly.
2,OOPS,"I had high hopes for this watch since it was a Timex. I work in a nursing facility and liked the lighted dial. I was trying to set the time, however, for time change and the whole stem pulled out of the watch making it pretty useless. Silly me. I certainly got what I paid for."
1,Poor Quality,This watch is of an extraordinary poor quality. The light failed on the first one I had. I bought a second one out of simple need and an appreciation of it's classic look. I am tired of needing to repair the watchband for the fourth time so am now looking for a new watch. My first criteria be that it not be a Timex.
3,watch worked for 4 years before stopping,"This watch worked for 3-4 years before it started to slow down and stop randomly. Now it is useless (Yes, the watch does have a fresh battery). I have been very careful with it -- never went near water with the watch even though it is supposed to be water-safe.The leather band broke after 2 years. Then I had to repurchase one leather band each year. So, it might be cheaper to stick with a metal band to start with.2 seiko watches in my family have worked for 20 years, and are still going strong and accurate. If the timex breaks every 4 years, then it really is cheaper in the long run to get a good watch that would last a long time.But the timex is cheap. If you want something that lasts a couple of years, then this is pretty good."
2,TIMEX Didn't Last,"I bought this TIMEX Indiglo watch for my wife less than two years ago, and in less than 18 months it quit working properly. The second hand sticks, and even moves backwards sometimes, when between the 6 and 8 on the watch face - causing the watch to constantly loose time at the rate of 12 to 15 seconds per minute. This, oviously, makes the watch useless, and the one-year warantee is equally useless. I replaced the battery, but that didn't help. Very disappointing for a watch from a company that did, at one time, make more reliable watches. The two stars I gave it are on the generous side."
4,Lifting the mists of time,"The book, Forensic Genealogy, was received in a timely manner and was well packaged. Being a genealogy addict, I immediately opened it and began reading. The sections on research using city directories and Irish naming conventions led to possible hits on a family line that has remained elusive for years. The section on DNA, while difficult to comprehend and requiring several re-readings, helped me understand DNA results that made it appear I was related to half the population of Ireland. There are many references, written and Internet, that will help open more doors to the past. Dr. Fitzpatrick writes in an easy, free flowing, almost conversational tone which makes it difficult to put the book down. I would have given it five stars except I dislike having to proofread while I read. There are typos, many typos; SpellCheck does not and will not replace human proofreaders. Despite that, Forensic Genealogy is a must have for every genealogist’s library."
5,Great Book!,"I ordered this book shortly after it came out and have used the techniques presented, over and over again. My favorite part is the section on identifying photographs and believe me, once you read that section you'll never look at a picture in quite the same way again. The only thing is, I want to spend all my genealogy time looking at the boxes of old pictures family members have give me. (smile)But that's a good thing, and learning to examine, not just look at the pictures has taught me to see more in them, and also transfer the same skills to examining records. You won't regret buying a copy of ""Forensic Genealogy,"" which, by the way is very readable, in addition to all the other merit."
4,Forensic Genealogy: A Recomended Resource,"This is not your usual basic family history book. It effectively teaches one how to think and analyze way outside the box. Once you have gathered all your family's pertinent material, this book will take you way beyond birth, death, and marriage records. The author brilliantly demonstrates how to use city directories, weather data, photo intelligence mensuration techniques, sleuthing approaches, and even a chapter on DNA testing and tracking. This is a wonderful teaching vehicle and reference manual. We would recommend it to all serious genealogists.The author takes a highly technical subject area and transforms it into understandable tools for one to use with excellent examples from her own family investigations. This book is a mind expanding read, and we rated it a high four hearts."
5,Great Read - Thinking Outside the Box,"The only drawback to this book is that you don't want to put it down. The ideas presented by Ms.Fitzgerald present a new approach to looking at old photographs, thinking outside the box to solve some of those genealogy mysteries! Using DNA is probably the only way we will ever determine some of our ancestors. This book provides a clear understanding of this process. This book should be on the shelf of anyone who is researching family history,whether they do it as a hobby or profession. Ms. Fitzpatrick has given clear and concise information which will surely aid anyone who is currently ""stuck"" working through their genealogical research."
3,More Q Stuff,"Sounds...And Stuff Like That!! is a 1978 release from Quincy Jones that features some pre-solo star career vocals from Luther Vandross. The best of which is a cover of the Doobie Brothers ""Takin' It To The Streets"" where he duets with Gwen Guthrie. Mr. Jones transforms the beat in to a gospel vibe and Mr. Vandross and Ms. Guthrie are marvelous. ""Stuff Like That"" is a funky track with Ashford & Simpson & Chaka Khan providing vocals. ""Love, I Never Had It So Good"" is a bouncy number co-written and sung by Patti Austin. ""Tell Me A Bedtime Story"" takes Mr. Jones back to his straight jazz days with Herbie Hancock playing a beautiful electric piano."
3,An all-time favourite,"This has always been one of my favourite albums, and I'm so happy that I've finally got it on CD. Every home should have one! :-)"
4,Interesting survey,"I'm reading Leick's book right now, and enjoying it. She surveys ancient Mesopotamia through the examination of 10 ancient city sites, from Eridu to Babylon. Naturally this narrative device is a springboard for digressions into the culture as best we can know (or guess) at it. Leick does stints as a tour guide, if I recall the author bio correctly, & it shows in her writing, which is accessible if a bit repetitive when she wants to make a point. She also attends to the different archaelogists who've dug up Mesopotamia and their biases, hypotheses, etc.; she takes a similar approach with contemporary scholarly debates, ""teaching the conflicts"" as it were. This & Roux's ""Ancient Iraq"" seem to be the two best books for us lay readers in the past 40 years or so."
2,not worth it,"Did not have full funtion of controls....Magix did not help, said product too old. this is a 2000 version. save your money."
2,Pretty Bad Stuff - Software abysmal,"Saw some reviews where folks go this to work, wish i was one of them. I can capture to a 1.6 gig MPEG file that is 30 minutes of video, but when i burn using sonic, it turns out to be a 5 minute dvd. Sonic decided to end the DVD at an apparent random spot! AND it takes 2 hours for the privilege of finding out that your DVD is a coaster. I'm not optimistic about the email support. It will probably be back at compusa before they reply. Sonic support web page wont even load!Running on XP sp2. Capture seems to work most of the time, though it will crash/hang for no apparent reason, requiring reboot, just getting it to DVD is the problem. The encoding is foreign to any 3rd party ive tried, like tmpgenc, so im stuck with sonic. I tried on my PC and my laptop with same result. Boxing this up to go back to COMPUSA tomorrow. I think 12 hours in front of my pc trying to make a single DVD is enough."
3,Terrorists are out to get a major political leader,"Yet another book about a band of terrorists out to assassinate a political leader, in this case President George Bush. The rationale is somewhat slow to develop, and the plot seems to borrow heavily from the Day of the Jackal. The story is filled with action, converging characters, and possibly too many dead bodies for reasons that are never totally clear. The ""trained assassin"" seems a little too easily distracted by women he uses and casts aside, but this villain comes to a surprising end and the hero and heroine survive, although emotionally damaged. The secret leader of the terroists leaves many tracks leading in his direction, but gets away clean. Are these final events setting the reader up for a sequel?"
2,Are you kidding me?,"I thought this book was barely worth more than the paper it was written on. The ""world-famous author who is using a fake name"" could have done so much more with it. There was an interesting twist where the main character (who can have any woman he wants, of course) accidentally sleeps with both a mother and a daughter. I thought he could have taken that and ran with it. The main character is killed far too abruptly. We never find out exactly why he hates America so much. I thought the information on Sarin was interesting, if scary, and I thought it was uncanny that the book was about Bush and terrorism and religion. All in all, very flat read, but I have to admit, I finished it. Realistically, though, Sonny had a brickish personality and probably couldn't get any woman, no matter how attractive. So unrealistic it was distracting."
4,action thriller - professional assassin after the President,Follow Sonny a professional political assassin and member of a secret terrorist group in his bid to murder the President of the U.S. The author did a commendable job in creating a charismatic and even likeable villain. Great page turner with lots of action although a bit Hollywood.
3,summer read,"this is a good summer read. i enjoyed the plot, however, the ending is tepid. i thought the assasin's fascination and interest in women to be an interesting touch."
4,"More like a brochure for visiting ""ghost watchers"".","The small volume was a treasure trove of information, and is especially intriguing since I am currently in Okinawa and living in Kitanakagusu-son, one of the villages mentioned in the book. Unfortunately, more substance would have been appreciated about a subject that could fill larger volumes of text. A great effort, though, in introducing the world to Okinawa's relationship with the spirit world."
5,All Flesh Is Grass,I was very pleased with the information in this book. It was extensive and detailed. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in improving their pasture.
4,interesting book,I found this book to be well writtten and thought out. It is full of interesting ideas some of which I will be trying myself.
3,Good specifics on pasture,"I liked Logsdon't specifics on the effects of different kinds of pasture. I think he misses an important opportunity with his unstructured grazing--See Joel Salatin's Salad Bar Beef for balance. The intense management of grazing (Salatin) makes a more sanitary environment and eliminates the need for antibiotics. Salatin is indifferent to the choices of grass variety on which Logsdon devotes so much time. The two authors provide complementary perspectives, including different details. Logsdon discusses fencing in some detail--I share his reluctance to depend on electric fence for boundaries-Salatin dismisses it and goes all electric. Both authors are persuasive advocates for grass fed beef."
4,Early Blaylock Hits The Spot,"This early James Blaylock novel introduces the world of Theophile Escargot, Twombly Town and the evil dwarf, Abner Helstrom, all of whom then show up later in Blaylock's The Elfin Ship and The Disappearing Dwarf. Escargot chases off after a beautiful serving girl he barely knows, but when she is threatened by the evil dwarf Escargot manages to steal a magic submarine and the race is on. The dwarf's intention to use her as a sacrifice to arouse sleeping giants for his evil purposes. In his effort to save her Escargot falls in with an a group of elves in a flying three masted galleon and about 10,000 little men who are 2 inches tall. It all comes to a G. Smithers' style conclusion. (You'll find out who G. Smithers is when you read the book.) Like other Blaylock fantasy it is full of elves, goblins and mystery and stars an unlikely hero. A very good read for everyone and for Blaylock fans it's an absolute must."
1,You get what you pay for,I returned this case after receiving it. It was very cheapy made and probably would not have made the first flight I was going to use it.I did upgrade to a better quality Skyway bag and it is working fine.
1,Unimpressed,I was unimpressed with this book. The Christian basis for this book was too much for me - a non-Christian - to bear. I think it may be more helpful for someone of the same religious background as the author. I read the reviews before I bought it...and didn't realize HOW rooted in Christianity this book is. This is a warning to all the people buying this book...if you're not a Christian...you may not find it helpful.
2,"Heavy Christian, Biblical, Ministry Bent was Unexpected","Although I got some helpful perspectives in this book, I was completely thrown off guard with the strong focus on Biblical quotes. All of the stories referred to were about men and families in the Christian Ministry. The subject of sexual addiction was consistantly referred to as ""sin"". I felt it was unfair that this overly religious take was nowhere to be found in the writeups or reviews on this book. I felt I had been mislead into buying a book that I might otherwise not have bought had I known."
2,Heavy christianity focus was disappointing.,"This book only shares the viewpoint of Christian families, a belief which I don't share to the rigid extent that it is used in this book. If your belief system is more spiritual based - not religious based, then this book is probably not for you. I didn't like the shaming way sex addiction is referred to as ""sexual sin"". I returned the book without finishing."
5,Enjoyed,This book was very informative and really helped me to understand this issue. I would recommend this to anyone dealing with this and a spouse.
2,Off the Mark,"I was totally disapointed with this book. After reading lots of reviews for this, as well as other books on this topic, I decided I'd have to take a chance with it. I guess I shouldn't have. The majority of the book was about support groups; finding and/or starting one for (you the reader) having spouses with sexual addictions... This book seemed to be more geared towards actual physical unfaithfulness such as sex with prostitutes, random sexual affairs, etc. If you are looking for a book on pornography and internet affair issues, I wouldn't recommend this book."
1,Not for wives of husbands who want to change,"I read this book for a friend and it was nowhere near as good as Breaking Free (by Russ Willingham) that my husband and I read to address the same problem. From what I gathered, Marsha Means has never herself experienced sexual betrayal, just the fear of it. She has some basic info on codependency in the book, but I would argue that the wife chapter in Breaking Free is just as practical without all the scary stories with no resolution. If your husband wants to change, read Breaking Free together and leave this one on the shelf. You might find yourself loving your husband through his not-so-secret wars, not just living with him."
5,At last...,"At last a book that really speaks to my heart. This book covers so many of the different types of sexual addiction out there. Yes, it does have a Christian foundation in the recovery process, but that is what I needed. When testimonials are given by other women, they speak to my heart and help with the grief. Sexual addiction is a struggle of morality. It violates our wedding vows, it makes you wonder who you have been lying next to in bed, going to church with, and eating family dinners with. This book has helped me understand this is not my problem, but I can be there for him. So many books send the message that it's his problem so I should go off and take care of myself, to heck with him. This book gives a hope to repair my broken heart and be there for him."
3,Pretty good in some parts,"This book was pretty good, however, I finished reading it with a sense of that the story was left unfinished. The author provides many women's stories of how pornography effected their marriages and relationships but really doesn't do much in terms of offering suggestions on how to help your husband through the addiction and how to continue living for Christ during this trying time. Good book of truth-telling experiences, but bad when one is looking for actual help."
5,Great book for partner's of sexual addicts,This book was one of the few I had found that address sexual addiction from the woman's point of view. It addresses the discovery of the addiction and how to get help for yourself and for the addict. There are a lot of references in the directory and there is also a chapter on how to begin group therapy for the woman. Great book-very enlightening!
1,EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED,"Based on the mostly positive reviews, I purchased it. Well, believe the negative reviews. The cheap (think dollar store) glass teapot WITHOUT strainer holds 18 ounces. Since I just received this yesterday, I only used one flower which failed to bloom and the tea flavor was not impressive. The concept is unique, but way too pricey for what you get. As for the bamboo box, it is pretty but not really sufficiently sturdy to store anything except very light weight items."
4,"Nice tasting, pretty looking tea!","I have seen Numi teas around at my local coffee and tea shops. I found this on a Gold Box Deal and decided to try it out. I like how the tea bud blossoms and looks so nice when the tea is steeped. The only negative is the small teapot. I have this at work, and have to bring hot water to my desk, then pour in the teapot otherwise the teapot gets extremely hot, too hot to the touch. Even pouring it into a cup when the tea is steeped needs to be done with caution. Otherwise for the price, its a nice variety of special teas, for any occasions!"
4,Makes a high class gift,"This is a very nice gift, the tea is great, you will want to seek out your local tea shops to get more great flowering teas."
1,Item never received after 1 month,The item looks great but we never received it. I ordered it in NOvember and it is still January and have not received it yet. I have contacted the company.
3,Tiny tea pot!,"Bought this item as a gift, and I was disappointed to see how tiny the tea pot is. It's definitely a one-person pot. The gift box looks nice. Can't comment on the tea itself, however."
3,Nice packaging,You really need HOT water to make these open up..tea will probably be cold by the time the flower opens ..maybe I did something wrong..give them the benefit of the doubt
1,False Advertising,This is soooo false!! The box looks great and it is but the actual tea pot is smaller than my tea CUP!! It makes barely enough tea for one person.
1,LIES AND DECEIPT,"I ordered this item well before Xmas as a gift for a secret santa gift. They told me it wouldnt be shipped till the 26 but would arrive before Jan, 1st. This was after Amazon said if items ordered will get to their destination before Xmas. First LIE. Then on Dec 30, I receive a email saying they are out of stock and would NOT be able to ship this item at all. One day before it was to arrive. This leaves me without a gift and no possibility for replacement in time. This is just too much sloppy handling of accounts. I am VERY UNHAPPY and you should be very very careful with this company. It is from TAYLOR'S MARKET and should be passed up."
1,Cheap Chinese tea,"Only buy this if you like the taste of chinese tea. Actually, if you like chinese tea, you can buy it a lot cheaper than this. Way overpriced for what you get. It does not taste like American tea, if that is what you are seeking, choose another brand. The ""flowering"" effect is not that dramatic or pretty. And to taste llike full brewed tea, you can only use each one once."
5,Great product,Very satisfied with this order. The tea looks great and the box that it came in is very nice as well.
5,The Perfect Gift For Your Unusual Friends,"I was looking for something different for my daughter and she was just stunned with how lovely this gift set is. It worked beautifully, and she adores it. I have plans to send this to two other unique friends. a fantastic value and a gift they will always remember"
3,Unlabeled Pearls,Well this is mainly an observation from just unboxing it. The little teapot is good enough for just about one cup I would say. So if you drink tea just by yourself probably good for you but for multiple people no. I opted to use my French Press to make it because the tea pearls release little bits of the leaves into the water. Will probably update later in what I think of the quality of the rest of the teas not to sure what tea I drank since the pearls were not labeled. But the bamboo box it comes in is gorgeous.
3,Decent,"The best thing about this tea is that it is unusual. I received it as a gift as I am a tea lover. The tea tastes pretty good, but no better really than your average box of tea and not as good as many of the loose leaf teas I have tried. I would possibly gift it to someone who is beginning to like tea only because it is a unique gift, not to those who might be ""tea connoisseurs"" of sorts."
3,Very pretty.,"What is so great about these teas is the novelty. They are beautiful to watch flower, which has a very calming effect, which is something I enjoy about tea in general. So the beautiful appearance is a bonus in that area. However, these are not the best tasting teas I've tried and I love Numi teas. They are not bad, they are worthwhile soft flavors, but if I were buying simply on taste I probably would not purchase Numi flowering teas again. Also, the actual glass teapot is very small, maybe makes enough for two people at the most. The box the flowering teas are sent is reusable, but poorly constructed. Not really worth keeping if that sort of thing matters to you. In short I would buy again, but mostly for aesthetic reasons."
5,My mother loved it!,I was thinking that the package was much bigger but i loved the bamboo box it was in. I ordered it for my mother for her bday and she was soo excited when she saw what it was. Too cute!
4,Flowering tea was a hit at the tea party !!!,I had a tea party theme for a baby shower for my son and his wife. I purchased the Numi's Bouquest Bamboo Gift Set with clear tea pot and flowering teas. I described the flowering teas before putting them in the teapot and conversation was great as the flowers opened up to make tea. It was part of the event that I know our guests talked about the next day.
5,The best gift,"I bought five and gave them as holiday gifts to friends. The genuine rave reviews I received confirmed my initial feeling about this product. Unusual, different, functional and festive."
4,Smaller than it appears in the picture but beautiful!,"I purchased this product for a friend's birthday. I thought this teapot would be one that she could use to entertain and would hold several cups of tea. However, the teapot is considerably smaller than it appears in the picture. Regardless of size, the teapot and the flowering tea are beautiful and my friend loved it!"
4,Very nice teaset,I have had this set for a while now and enjoy the teas very much. The box is very handsome and I am wondering what I can put in it. I enjoy tea very much and this is a unique set. The flavors are very good and soothing. When I want some tea that satisfies me I use this pot. I love teas and this set is especially nice. I would buy it as a gift for someone I care about. Makes about six cups from each bud. The pot is very durable. It has hit the floor at least five times and never developed as much as a crack.
3,"Pretty and functional, but small","I was excited to receive this, and it is very pretty, but very tiny. It stated how many ounces it was, I guess I just didn't put that into relative terms. It makes about one cup of tea, and the first one is a pretty strong one. Because it is so concentrated, it's hard to see the little bloom once the tea steeps.For a pretty decoration, it's nice. If you have one cup of tea a day, it's nice. I, personally, am going to purchase a bigger one."
5,Fab Gift!,Makes a great gift! Impressive packaging and amazing tea! The blooming tea makes an excellent finale to a dinner party. This is a winner!! I buy this for everyone I know who loves tea and finally bought one for myself.
4,Pretty Pleased,I sent this item as a gift for one of my relatives. She took a picture of it and sent it to me. She really enjoyed it and was pleased with the contents of the package. I saw the picture and was pretty pleased with the beautiful box that it came in and the little pot and tea that it came with.
2,Good price and an okay product but cheap looking bamboo gift box,"Amazon has a good price on this product compare to other places. This tea set is allright, and the idea to have the flowering tea is kind of cool, (There are better tasting flowering tea in the market such as Harney & Sons.) however. the bamboo box that contain the tea set is poorly made. The orange paint on the box will come off on your fingers when you touch it, and you need to be careful not to get splinters when you are openning the box. If they can package it better it would have been a really cool gift. I originally bought it as Xmas gift to give to a friend, but the quality is not as good as my expectation so I decided to keep it. The flowering tea looks cool but don't expect too much on the taste. I wouldn't buy this product again."
3,Jury is still out,"I gotta say that I was really excited for this product-- it was the perfect gift for my mom-- but not so happy with how it all worked out. My biggest issue? The flowers didn't always open the way they were supposed to, and even when they did I sort of felt like I was drinking tea with a giant sea anenome stuck in the teapot. The tea itself was pretty good, and it's still an interesting novelty gift (more power to these people for coming up with this idea), but I just don't think it's all it's cracked up to be. I'm going to try some more soon, so my opinion may change, but right now, I'm a little disappointed."
2,expensive and disappointing,I bought this for my mother-in-law for Mother's Day. I was very excited for her to receive the Numi flowering tea set with bamboo basket because she is an avid tea drinker. _After_ ordering I was informed that this item was on backorder and would not arrive until the week following Mother's Day (May 13). It did not arrive until May 25th. I saw it this weekend and was very disappointed with the quality of the tea flowers (a big mushy ugly mess in the tiny teapot provided) and with the bamboo box it was sent in (very cheap). This was surprising to me considering how much I paid and the quality I associate with the Numi brand normally. Don't buy this if you're expecting a beautiful and lavish gift set. It's not.
4,What a gift!!!,I received a set of blooming tea for Christmas.Most of the teas are really good but they are all just so interesting. One way to enjoy the set longer is that when the tea flavor is done if you just want to look at the creation(flower or grass or whatever just drain it off and put cold water in the pot.I have the drogon one in water for 4 days now. It sits right beside me. I just change the water when it gets too yellow.I wish I would of thought to do this sooner because this is my last one of the ones that came w/the set. It would have given me even more joy....
2,"Excited at first, disappointed later","Well, beautiful packaging....first one we did was ok, the Starlight Rose....but the Dragon Lily? The bloom was black. I gave away 5 of these as gifts. I hope that they don't have the same disappointing problem.The photo of what the Dragon Lily should look like was not at all what it was. I followed the directions to the T. We got a shriveled black flower, not a beautiful full red bloom."
2,NIce presentation but label takes away from the appearance,"I am disappointed with this purchase and I am keeping it for myself because I am too ashamed to give it to my mom. I thought this would be a great birthday present. I was wrong. My mother loves wooden boxes, well this one turned out too ugly to present to her. When the label was removed there was damage to the box, real damage. Looks like water damage to wood."
1,YUCK!,Are negative stars possible!!!! Moldy on the outside and the insides. Looked like some sort of insect eggs as well. AWFUL. And it absolutely sucks that it cannot be returned.
1,no returns,I ordered three of these and one came with no packing around it and the pot was broken. When I went online I found there were no returns on this item. I am VERY disappointed.
2,More packaging than gift,"Flowering tea is a nice gift idea, so I bought five of these based on the ratings here. Big mistake. What you get is a cheaply made, garish box that is stuffed with a lot of cardboard shred. This all comes packed inside an outer cardboard box. Somewhere in the middle of all this cheesy packaging is a Dollar Store quality glass teapot and a small box of flowering tea. I am embarassed to give this as a gift. I took the tea out of the box and put it in a small gift bag. I will recycle as much of the pile of packaging junk as possible. A complete waste of money and even though it is mostly packaging, Amazon calls it ""grocery"" and I cannot return it. Please don't waste your money on this one."
1,Terrible weak tea,"I only paid $12.50 when they had this for a daily special but it wasn't even worth that. Maybe the tea was old, that is why it was so cheap. The flowering teas don't flower and float at the top. Nothing like the picture. The leaves soak up the water and puff out and fall apart. But that I can live with. The tea is completely tasteless. Just like drinking hot water. I have tasted many teas, bags and loose leaf and nothing as bad as these. But the little glass teapot is cute. And it IS tiny."
2,"Pretty Flowers, Horrid Flavor.","The flowers were great. They know how to deliver there. The pot is very small though. I was only able to pour one cup of tea from it. And the tea? That was a joke. Mine tasted ABOSOLUTELY horrible! I couldn't drink it. Maybe some people who like bitter, overly herbal tastes will like this but I like my tea lighter.(The teapot also burned my hand a little as the glass is so thin- please be careful!)"
2,Not worth it,"I was interested to see this product since the reviews seemed a bit varied. The box isn't worth keeping, the tea is not particularly tasty and it doesn't really ""flower"" - at least not very impressively.I don't think it's worth the money."
3,small,Did not open the bamboo container as it is a gift but the container itself is very small so I assume the contents inside are also small. Was disappointed with scratches on the bamboo - makes it look cheap. I am apprehensive about giving this as a gift.
5,Awesome Gift for the Price,This is a great set. Better than the rest of them on Amazon. You get a bunch of flowering tea's and the tea pot that you add hot water to.Thanks!!!
5,Great gift idea,"I bought this set for a valentine's day gift for my girlfriend for around $24. It went over great. The bamboo case was really unique, and my paper cover came off without damaging the wood (I was really careful). The clear tea pot was nice, but a little on the thin and fragile side. The tea itself was great, they tase wonderful and look cool in the clear pot. I definitely recommend this set as a gift."
4,"Great Gift, Could Use More Tea!","I bought these on the gold box deal for 12.50. Great deal for a rather fancy gift for girlfriend who is going through finals. She loved it! It is both yummy tea, and mildly entertaining to watch the tea open. It would be nice if there were more than 9 packets, but you can't really complain at 12.50."
3,maybe it is not MY cup of tea!,The product is exactly what it is stated as. The flowers bloom and are beautiful. The little pot is the right size for two tea cups. You can put more hot water in and the next cups are as good as the first. My only problem is that the tea tastes like boiled grass! I am thinking that this is just not 'my cup of tea'! I like a more full bodied tea.
4,Drink and a Conversation Piece,"The only thing stopping me from rating this as a 5 is the quality of the teapot itself is slightly lacking. Mine arrived chipped and the lid doesn't sit very well which makes pouring it a bit difficult, but for the price it's hard to argue.After I've brewed each tea flower about 4 times, I will re-fill the teapot with cold water, and this works as a centerpiece on my counter for about a week! Guests will notice and ask about the teapot, at which time I empty out the old flower, and voila! Instant entertainment and a great cup of tea. I also feel better about the price of the tea flowers knowing that I have ended up with over two months worth of enjoyment of looking at the blossoms.The tea itself is pretty decent. I liked the jasmine green the best, but was pleasantly surprised by the rose flavored one.This is definitely not recommended for your daily cuppa' because of the increased price, but it makes for a great pot to share with a friend."
2,Not Good,My mother got this as a gift. The flowers never completely opened and they broke part. You ended up drinking the flowers. The tea wasn't a great flavor either.She also bought be a set of glass cups to drink the tea in. But they got so hot you couldn't hold them.I would stick with tea bags or loose tea and a mesh strainer.
3,"Bad smell for first ""flower""","I got this gift box of Nami flowering tea leaves for Christmas. Sat down to my first cup this morning. No labels on the ""flowers"" so I decided to choose the darkest leaves as it might be the best morning tea. After pouring water over it a horrible smell came off of it. I had to pour it down the sink. I give 3 stars for a great bamboo box,but so far the tea is not drinkable. Also without labels you don't know if you pour hot water on delicate green tea leaves or boiling water on the black leaves. I wouldn't buy it again."
5,luv these teas,"honestly this was a christmas gift and at first i thought they wasted their money but i was wrong! these teas are very tasty and u can reuse the same flower 3 or 4 times, depending on how strong u like your tea, plus they're really cool to watch open! enjoy tea again...."
1,do not buy this,This was a waist of $. The flowering tea DOES NOT FLOWER! No matter how hot you get it! Dissapoinment! WAIST IF $!
4,Great Gift,I bought this as a gift and it worked out great. The packaging is beautiful and the tea is neat to watch grow!
4,lovely gift,"This is a lovely gift. It makes tea time an aesthetic experience and feels like a mini trip to the spa. The beauty of the flower opening, the aroma of the fragrant tea and the warm liquid create a multi-sensory moment of pleasure."
3,soo cute,"the tea was cute and just perfect for the three of us, but the pitcher could be a little bigger. I had to steep three seperate times just for ys to all have a cup"
5,Numi Tea box,"I loved this gift box of teas. It was something different, and a unique gift for my husband for valentines day. I want to purchase another gift box of flowering teas for my friends birthday in May."
1,DON'T BUY THIS Hobbit Tea Set.,"If I was a Hobbit, this might be a nice tea pot. Since I am not a Hobbit, this pot holds enough for a couple of big gulps. What a waste of money. It looked so nice in the pictures. It is non returnable. I have not tried the tea. Maby I will make a couple of gulps in the morning."
1,Musty Smell and Poor Taste,"The packaging was very musty smelling! After throwing out the shredded paper and airing it out for weeks, the smell has come out of the boxes to the point that I may consider using them for something. The tea itself had a terrible taste! I bought another box of the same tea somewhere else and it's not so bad as what arrived in this set. Still, I'm not very impressed with the taste of the tea. Also, the flowers in the set did not have good color and were very drab. Also, the teapot holds a very small amount, as others have said. I would not recommend this at all."
5,Great gift!,"I have bought this for several grandmothers/mothers over the last year, and it has been joyfully received. They are tired of bath and body products! Nice price, presentation, and quality tea product."
3,numitea.com,"This is a wonderful product for oneself or as gifts. The tea is delicious and the box is not only biodegradable it can be used for other things when the tea is gone. I purchased several from amazon.com last September when the price was far better. However, at numitea.com, the manufacturer, it retails for [...]. So why it says on amazon.com it retails for [...] is not clear."
2,Disappointed!,"The presentation was good, but I gave this as gifts last year and my sister who got one of the boxes said the tea is beautiful but tastes ""weedy"" rather than like real tea. I tried some and agree.Not sure if it was just a bad batch, or if we have discriminatory tastes. I usually drink Stash teas and my sister drinks Bigelow & CS teas."
5,Very neat idea,great product - something different and a good conversation piece. really very cool to see. the teapot is good quality as well
4,unique gift,Gave this to my sister as a gift and she loved it. However she said the tea wasn't the best tasting in the world.
3,gift,"The packaging looked nice but excessive and the actual contents were somewhat disappointing. The actual amount of tea in the individual small plastic baggies in the small bamboo box in the shredded paper padding within the larger bamboo box within the paper wrapping within the cardboard box within the plastic air packets within the shipping box was miniscule. The bamboo box that it came in that houses the teapot and box of tea is cute but not the sturdiest thing ever. I hope I never drop it. It's also a lot bigger than I realized it would be. As for the teapot, it's cute but a good glass teapot doesn't have the sort of imperfections you can see in this (unless I'm just unlucky in getting the one with the bubbles).Lowest price I've seen this here: about $18"
3,"Great visual, substandard reality...","The packaging looks fantastic, but leaves orange residue on my hands.The tea pot looks lovely, but seems terribly fragile when picked up.The tea 'blossoms' beautifully, but tastes old and weak.I'm usually a fan of all things Numi, but this one falls far short of the mark. Three stars for the visual and presentation (has to count for something--it IS meant to be seen) and for not being entirely undrinkable."
5,"Nice packaging, great teas!","I got this set when it was offered as the goldbox deal. I absolutely love it. It comes in a bamboo box. The box is very good-looking. The glass teapot is great in size. The teas come in a smaller box that is situated inside the larger box. So far I tried Starlight Rose, Dragon Lilly and Jasmine Pearls. Jasmine Pearls is my favorite so far. The teas not only look very beautiful as they are unfolding in the glass teapot when some hot water is poured on them, but they also taste very good. They last about 4 teapots. If you are looking for something new and exciting for your tea time, you found what you are looking for! I will definitely buy again!"
3,"Numi,s flowering tea set in bamboo box","Nice set, but it would have been much nicer if the box had been allowed to remain the original bamboo color (perhaps only with some clear lacquer), if one strip of the bamboo in the front part of the box had been stained like the rest, and if the glue used to hold the paper sticker on the box did not mar the finish when removing the paper. The description furnished by Amazon could have been more explicit, too. The ingredients, much more valuable than the box (but the box is important too), are as advertized. This would have rated five stars, otherwise."
5,Spectaular Gift,This is a spectacular gift for a relatively small price and will delight anyone who loves tea. The pot inside the set is specially made so that you can watch the flowers burst open when the hot water is poured in. A very special kind of gift. So special that I bought one for myself!
3,My Take,"While this is a lovely thoughtful gift, don't expect the handcrafted mahogany bamboo chest to be anything you want to display, or keep. It just wouldn't hold up. It is crudely made and not what you might expect. Compare it to something your child might have made at camp when he/she was 7 years old. You're close. But, hey, if you like rickety workmanship, then by all means, this is for you.The tea ""buds"" are nicely hand sewn, and it's a joy to watch them open to a flower. My complaint is that they are not individually labeled so it is a surprise what flavor tea you are brewing. The buds don't resemble the pictures displayed as a guide.Overall, the price is about right."
1,"Cheap,not as advertised,one cup pot breaks easily,dud flowers","I read other reviews that there was at least a 16 ounce glass teapot...wrong!! It barely hold one cup and broke the second time I used it it is so cheap.First barely flowered, the second not at all. had bought these for presents but cannot give..embarrassingly cheap. you also cannot return to Amazon so am stuck with them. Not top quality or giftable."
3,"Beautiful packaging, small product",The packaging is really beautiful but the glass teapot was a disappointment. It is extremely small and seems to have very little functional value. I would not recommend this as a practical gift to anyone. It seems more like something you'd buy if you really had no idea what to get someone and wanted something very generic.
5,"Excellent tea, bamboo box, and makes excellent gift set",I purchased several of the tea sets from Amazon to give for gifts as well as for myself. The tea tastes great and comes with two bamboo boxes which can be used for many things when tea is gone. Excellent value from Amazon! I caught them on sale and paid $12.50 a set. Highly recommended!
5,gift,I bought this to give as a gift and I was very happy with everything about it. I might even get one for myself... It also arrived before expected.
4,I like this tea or perhaps I just don't know better?,"I am an avid tea drinker and have been for years. I got this as a present for Christmas 2008. I have since read all of the reviews and think perhaps I am not much of a tea connoisseur after all or maybe it is that some of you all just got back batches of tea. I think it is a very nice gift set. Perfect for someone wanting to ""try"" flowering tea. The pot is small but I think a bigger pot wouldn't necessarily be better. I've used the flowers more than once and the tea still seemed good to me. I've really enjoyed the tea and the tea pot and the box it came in."
3,The gift for tea drinkers,This makes a nice gift for a dedicated tea drinker and Stash Tea has tea flowers. Not worth more than the $18.50 I paid.
4,"Value, Value, Value!","This little device fit into my MazdaSpeed 3 ashtray. The orange display is nearly a perfect match to the other other gauges in the car. For the price there is no better VALUE. I prefer XM over Sirius and the Mazda dealer was offering me a Sirius upgrade to my head unit for $400! I declined and then found this little unit. Reception over the FM band is great, no static and never loses a signal. The unit will on occasion not be able to pick up an XM signal on really cloudy days. The buttons on the unit are not useable because of how I have mounted it in the ashtray. The remote does a great job, but you have to be pointing it right at the unit. That's why it is a 4 vs. 5 stars."
1,Didn't work,"We got this for a friend as a gift, but when he installed it it would not hold reception. The wonderful seller did give a full refund, and was a pleasure to do business with. The fault was solely in the product."
1,disappointed to say the least,This purchase resulted in a product that was of no value to me. The product would not work without a high level of static. By the time I would pay return shipping and go to UPS thirty miles away I would ne out more than I spent on the initial purchase. Not worth it. Will not order from this firm again.
3,Too small,"This bucket is very cute but it's super small. It's good for when you have one person over or for standing up a bottle of wine in ice. It's not big enough for a party. Still, we are keeping it as it is well made and cute."
3,"Small, and tongs are not as shown","This is being returned. First, pay attention to the size...it is SMALL. Second, the tongs I received are C-H-E-A-P. They are not what is shown in the picture here and not what is shown on the box that the bucket came in. Looks like they found out that the tongs were missing and just threw in some cheap tongs that were lying around."
3,Nice LITTLE bucket,"It is a pretty little bucket that would hold a few ice cubes. However, it is hard for me to review this as an ice bucket, since that is not what I am using it for. It is very attractive but since I am using it with the lid off, I sprayed the ugly white plastic lining with silver paint. The handle on it is sturdy and I love the little, bitty tongs that comes with it. They would work well on an assortment platter to pick up olives. The lid is nice and heavy duty."
1,SUPA DUPA FLY is the product of an Anthropoid.,"Every time the drum machine and Rice Krispies(or whatever electronic junk is provided)becomes too banal,she simply whips out her Wildean wit to save potential comatose victimes by spitting out lines like""Beep beep who got da keys to da jeep""and""When the bad guys die dey die like ugh"". Alright,alright,so she doesent exactly have vocals that evoke images of a young Aretha Franklin and the prosiac junk that passes for verse was probably done in crayon.But look at it this way,when people finally relize that these hip-hop cretins are completly vacant of, intelligence,creativity and dynamics sales will plumit......"
3,"Good cd, although it has some filler","This album would've been excellent if it was shorter. Some of the tracks are pure filler. The standout tracks are: Sock It 2 Me, The Rain, Pass da Blunt, Hit'em Wit Da Hee, Friendly Skies and Best Friends. After all these years, ""The Rain"" and ""Sock it to Me"" still sound new and exciting. Also, ""Best Friends"" is one of the most beautiful songs Missy Elliott has ever written."
1,Not for all tastes,"Although this album was much hyped in many divergent sectors, I wish to warn that it ain't for all tastes! To my mind it's way over-produced and too poppy. If you like solid rap like A Tribe Called Quest or Ice Cube and don't like contemporary Urban R & B, or whatever it's called these days, you probably won't like this. If you like ""Can't Stand the Rain"" or anything else you've heard off of this album, you'll probably like it a lot. It's consistent, and does very well on its own terms. Unfortunately those terms are not mine. The only tracks I like are, ironically, Busta Ryhmes' ""Intro"" and ""Outro."" And it's not that I don't like women rappers or pop--what I've heard of Lauryn Hill's album I've been impressed with and can't get out of my head (and I like her work with the Fugees)."
2,"Amazon, you need to check your ""sounds that changed the...""","To have this CD on your list of ""sounds that changed the world,"" and to be missing yet so many others... is disgraceful. Your staff should NOT put out lists like this without doing actual homework. To have Missy and DJ Shadow up there, The Score twice, yet to miss true history is irresponsible.Some artists that are missing from your list.** SUGARHILL GANG, Run DMC, Eric B & Rakim, EPMD, Gangstar, Tribe Called Quest, Ultra MCs, (you want a femme? try) Queen Latifah,Digable Planets, MC Solaar (you SAID the world), Pharcyde, etc. Those are artists that truly changed sound around the world in this genre (the LPs should be obvious, since in almost all cases it's the debut)."
3,THE CD'S OKAY,"The cd was okay. I love Missy's beats and what not, but her lyrics are really horrible. She barely said anything. It's funny too, because Missy is a very talented song writer. She needs to spend more time writing her own lyrics. The beats are great, but they can't stand alone."
3,This album grew on me...now I love it.,"I bought this years ago when I first heard ""Beep Me 911"". I hadn't listened to it for sometime then put it on again. I now listen to alot, especially while working out.This disc has some lush, tight, soulful beats on it. I really think Missy is so talented. The melodies, the lyrics, her style all combine with great beats to make this a really enjoyable listening experience. I love that she integrates so many other artists into her songs (aaliyah, timbaland, da brat).Of course all the technique means nothing unless an artist has something to say - I think is where I feel Missy really shines. She keeps it real her delivering some direct, clever words about her life (especially the romantic side of it). She delivers some solid, soulful insight.There is a sensuality to a lot of her music here. And I feel she brings it in a confident, stylistic manner - that makes this disc a keeper.If you like soulful hip-hop from a diva...buy this disc."
3,"Missy ""Misdemeanor"" Elliott - Supa Dupa Fly","I have to add my two cents here since most of these 1-star reviews are from people who hate rap music and MTV (why are you even reviewing this anyway if you know you're not gonna like it?). Missy's first album isn't her best (her second album is) but it does show her skills and a sign of things to come. First off, Missy is more of an entertainer, not a singer or a rapper (even though she's decent at both). So if you want someone who's more talented at these things, pick up a Lauryn Hill record. Also, there are a lot of catchy songs on here like ""The Rain"" and ""Gettaway"", due to catchy choruses and wonderful production by Timbaland; so wonderful that he bites his own beats. That's right, Tim used a lot of these beats before, like on ""Don't Be Commin' (In My Face)"", a song that sounds exactly like SWV's ""Can We"". This makes the quality of the album go down. Otherwise, this was a good party-starter of an album."
5,CD Madness!,"Missy is hot. Her music is a not a traditional type of rap. She sings, raps, and do whatever else that makes her music different and can not be duplicated. I love her music and I hope you will to."
5,"The Best Debut (And Record) For ""97","Missy's debut album is the best record of '97. I've read almost every review written for this disc and the opinions are literally split. For me, this CD is not Missy's best, but it comes extremely close. I just don't get all the negative reviews for this brilliant album. I mean the beats, lyrics, featured artists, everything is truly magnificant. Don't wait any longer, get this CD now!"
4,Missy Is Hot,I think Missy is going far. I like her songs and the beat to them. I'll defenitly buy her CD.
3,A Christmas Noir,"I bought this some time ago and finally got around to watching it for THIS holiday season. Strange for Deanna Durbin, strange for Gene Kelly, and strange for a noir. I was sorry this dvd didn't have any commentary--I'd have liked to have learned the back story.And what a bizarre title for such a bleak story!This movie and ""Lady in the Lake"" are the only Christmas noirs that I can think of and for that reason ""Christmas Holiday"" is a must-have for fans of the genre.Incidentally, the acting was great if a bit over the top at the end."
1,Rip-off of a Durbin film,"I ordered this item and was expecting a good transfer. The image was grainy, but what was most annoying, is that the audio track skips, and acts like a badly scratched (or too often recorded!) CD/DVD. There is NO continuity to this film, and watching it is an exercise in utter frustration.I feel, even now, a year or more later, USED by the vendor peddling this product. With the marvelous transfer to VHS and DVD of the 'major' Durbin films, I expected that quality here. I have been sorely disappointed."
2,A ho hummer!,"I was looking forward to watching this movie because it stars Gene Kelly in a dramatic role and the beautiful singer, Deanna Durbin. Unfortunately, it was not what I expected. I thought it would be a nice Christmas movie judging from its title ""Christmas Holiday"". It had nothing whatsoever to do with Christmas! The story was rather morbid and not that interesting. No wonder Deanna Durbin retired soon after this one and that Gene Kelly went back to his extraordinary dancing roles. Even Deanna's singing couldn't save this one!"
3,Book title misleading,"When I first saw this book in hardcover, I jumped on it. After seeing the hardcover price, however, and what was ""inside"" I found I could leave it on the shelf.This book is basically the aircraft history of every single B-17 ever built. Now, if that's what you're looking for - then this book is for you. If, however, you're looking for the comprehensive narrative history of the B-17 Flying Fortress that you ""thought"" this book was going to give you -- keep looking. That's not what this is.Now that it's in paperback, I MIGHT consider purchasing it. As someone has said, this is like the ""B-17 telephone book"". It's an awesome reference work on each individual aircraft just like they maintain at the USAF Historical Research Agency in Montgomery, Alabama. For many, this book is ideal. For most of us, that's probably way too much detailed airframe information than we care for."
3,The B-17 Flying Fortress Story,"I was rather disappointed with the content of the book. Over 70% of it has little to do with ""story"" as the title promises. The majority of the book is more like a telephone book, with a 250-page (out of the total 319 pages) listing of 12,731 B-17s. Each of the entries starts with a US Army serial number assinged to the aircraft, followed by a series of dates and proper names (i.e., the aircraft's base assignments while in the U.S.). The length of the entries can be anywhere between 2 to 10 lines. The book is a valuable companion for B-17 experts or for people who has a passion for certain recorded facts about those 12,731 B-17s listed. And the 250-page listing is obviously an admirable outcome of strenuous work. But I would not recommend this book to people who want to read touching and exciting stories of or about the Flying Fortress. I have a feeling that I was misled by the book's title."
3,Not great shipping!,When i recieved this item it came usps priority mail and the bottle of this item came completely cracked. So there was no more further use of the bottle which i planned on using in airsoft battle. Shoppers of netlink enterprises beware that your product may come damaged.
4,"Great book, but object to basic premise","This book is a good buy. It discusses exactly what the title suggests: women and the law. However the book goes even further that that: it delves into issues affecting all women such as motherhood and the role of feminism in general. The author states she will analyze women in the law while focusing mainly on Harvard grads working in large law firms--supposedly because they have the greatest ability to affect the greatest change. I, personally, don't believe this assumption to be correct, but it doesn't affect the impact of this book. The author, herself, seems to dismiss her premise later on as she discusses the impacts of women in many other areas of law including governmental offices and politics in general. Buy this book if you are looking for some dissecting of the role of women in a patriarchicial legal system."
4,Great Read for Women in the Legal Field,"Mona Harrington not only asks, but analyzes the right questions about women lawyers. I enjoyed the thourough analysis of the topic. Great read."
2,"No inspiration, No enthusiasm, The worst DT album","I bought this CD based on what I`ve read in the reviews on this site.What a disappointment, nothing that reminds me of Awake, Metropolis or Images. No inspiration, No enthusiasm, just like the record company forced them to do the yearly album, so they came to `One more day at the office`.Ridiculous words (and I don`t expect them to be Jim Morrison), and the music ... Like ELP at their worst ... Bombastic with no inspiration and no enthusiasm (I wrote it before' didn't I?).Save your money, buy something else from DT, anything else but not this CD.I gave them 2 stars just because they are DT."
3,Some good performances but overall dull,"A lot more ballads and catchy stuff than it's healthy for DT and which don't stand the test of time. ""New Millennium"" is good, ""Lines In The Sand"" even excellent. The rest is fluff."
1,"Kevin out, harmony off.","The lack that Kevin Moore makes to the Dream Theater is unbelieveble. The feature of the band, who made it to be considered one of the best ones of the world, was the junction between technique and harmony. Without Moore, the both of them had decayed deeply. It's a pity, therefore they're all good instrumentists. It only lacks exactly a good arranjer. So, COME BACK, KEVIN MOORE, AND BRING THE I&W INSPIRATION AGAIN!!!"
2,Waste of talent,"THis band is amazing, only virtuosos there, but their kind of ""rock"" is incredibly boring in this album."
3,Eh,"If your new to Dream Theater- buy Images and Words, Awake, or Scenes from a memory- this CD doesent offer much"
2,DT's rock-prog duality at it's worst,"2 1/2Rightfully one of their weaker reviewed disc, the modern progressive rock behemoths's 4th studio felt like a conscious step backwards in the songwriting department, essentially dumbing down the complex and melodic metal that made the group interesting to begin with in favor of a more accessible sound. Always reliable in length at least, this release sounds stale, and nearly deadened with seemingly ancient 90's rock production cliches; the solidly mediocre onslaught is truly put in it's pathetic perspective up against the instrumental transcendence behind ""Hells Kitchen"" and a segment of the final blatant and futile attempt at your epic album medley closer."
4,"Up and down, but good overall","This is a very different Dream Theater album. There are some really heavy songs, and some lighter and moody ones. It seems to me that there is no middle ground. I either really love a song on this album, or I don't like it at all. This record has a few of my favorite DT songs on it. Hollow Years, Take Away My Pain, Burning My Soul, and Anna Lee are great, but none of the others do anything for me at all. I think that this album seems a bit more percussive than some of the others. It's still really good, and a must have for DT fans."
5,Awsome!!!,"Falling Into Infinity proves that Dream Theater is still the best band in the world. They are the only ""new"" music group that I like that is out now. All the other new bands do a bunch of Alternative crap."
3,OK,images and words is 5 stars- scenes maybe 5 also- 6 degress is 4- so this has to be 3- awake is 4- 4 1/2
4,Changing into Infinity&#65533;,"One thing I've always liked of Dream Theater is the way they conceive any album in a different way than the previous ones; some bands (Iron Maiden, AC/DC, etc.) choose the ""one sound for life"" philosophy while DT don't. Even though I prefer ""I&W"" and ""Awake"", most Italian metal magazines wrote that ""Fallig into Infinity"" was a failure, but they were and still are wrong, because they expected that DT would relase something like ""Images and Words - part II"". However, ""Images..."" has been conceived at the end of the 80s, more than five years earlier, and if ""You not Me"" doesn't sound like ""Take the Time"", it's just because the five guys have truly expressed what they really wanted to play (and they still play ""The Ytse Jam"" or ""Pull me Under"" live, so you have no reason to accuse them!). The only thing I really wonder is why they've always been cut off from Italian musical television channels."
4,Dream Theater Still Kicks Ass,"Though I'll admit that some of the songs on this album are long and excessively repetitive, Dream Theater still carries the prog. rock banner proudly into battle. For years Metallica was my favorite metal band, and being a drummer myself, I was dazzled by Lars Ulrich's skill. Mike Portnoy can play Lars under the table any day. To hell with keeping time, Mike's playing style is more unique than the band's music itself. The band's tightly interwoven musical interplay is fantastic and is guaranteed to keep one riveted. keep it up!"
3,Disappointing from DT,"Okay, this CD definitely isn't one of Dream Theater's best efforts. It almost sounds like the band got bored or something. Ever read a book by an author you absoultely love and get the feeling they just wrote it to meet a deadline? Well, that's what this sounds like to me. There are some good songs/moments on this CD like ""New Millenium"", ""Burning My Soul"" and the beautiful ""Anna Lee"". The best song on the album is ""Hollow Years"". Being a relatively new fan of Dream Theater I could probably sleep just fine never having bought this one. If you're a die-hard DT fan then go ahead and get this, if not then I wouldn't bother. I highly recommend their other CDs though, ""Awake"", ""Images and Words"" and ""Metropolis part 2: Scenes from a Memory"" (their best in my opinion)! These guys are still great musicians though, no doubt."
4,"Not the best DT album, but still great","This album sounds and feels a bit different from most other DT albums. A bit more organic, but overall darker, less rosy."
5,great CD,Dream theater PERIOD is a great band and people can say there junk and i asked sum one who told me that and he said he listens to blink 182 and i said no way they dont try hard for there pay check Dream Theater does
1,I hate this album,"I own and love very much every other dream theater album (except octavarium, i didn't like it that much) and let me tell you this album disappoints me, bores me, and depresses me to the extreme.don't buy it unless you like slow boring repetitive FILLER junk."
2,What Were They Thinking?,"Aside from two great songs, those being New Millenium and Lines in the Sand (Doug Pinnick is The Man), this album sounds like the band's attempt at a more ""Commercial DT"" (???) I mean the influx of 3rd party ""hitmaker"" songwriters and just the overall lameness of this album make it one to pass on. Big DT fans (Despite what you may be thinking, I DO consider myself one) will want it for the two numbers mentioned above (which makes it ALMOST worth the price of the CD)."
5,dream theater phd,on their fourth full length studio album this amazing new age orchestra really pushes the limits of controlling their instruments starting with the tama jesus mike portnoy well if youve heard dt before ther is really nothing i can add through the master of the strings jhon petrucci the amazing rhythm machine myung the keyboards god derek and the pavaroti of metal labrie
3,Stumbling into the right direction.,This time around Dream Theater get off their progressive-wannabe high horse and actually try to come up with the real thing;somehow they only make it half of the way- the other half being lame excursions into pop and 'see what I can do virtuosity'trips.Progressive bands are a dime a dozen these days-there are too many skilled musicians and not enough soul.
4,well...,"Despite the fact that some people refer to this this album as ""falling into s**t"", I find that there are so many brilliant moments on this record. I like New Millenium, Lines in the Sand, and Just Let Me Breathe. However the track that I enjoy the most on the record is Anna Lee. The haunting mood and lyric of this song never leave me completely. Most people I know actually hate that particular piece, but to me I find it most ironic that it did not become a radio hit...shame on radio programmers."
5,GREAT FROM BEGINNING TO END!!!,"This album is over all one of my favorite albums from Dream Theater. It is a change from the styles of the songs than ""Images and Words"". If you get used to listening to ""Images and Words"" then it might take you a while to get used to this album without checking out the albums Dream Theater had put out inbetween the two. (Change of Seasons, Awake, and When Dream and Day Unite). For EXCELENT songs you must check out; Hollow Years, Peruvian Skies, Hell's Kitchen, Take Away My Pain, and Anna Lee."
4,"Not progrssive, but still a good album","I read an article where the band was told by their record company that they had to do an album that wasn't like the first 3 they recorded. So it wasn't their fault for changing direction on this CD. Don't complain if it sounds different. I like this album for that very reason. There is some ""bluesy"" influence in ""Lines in the Sand"" and straight ahead hard-rock in ""Burning My Soul"". ""New Millenium"" is just a great song, especially Portnoy's drum parts. LaBries vocals are more laid back and raw. I like his vocals all the time but here he sounds even better. ""Take Away My Pain"" -excellent guitar solo, very emotional. ""Anna Lee""....""Let it Be"" meets ""Bohemian Rhapsody""-great song and solos. All of DREAM THEATER's stuff is great and this is a good album."
3,"An ""average"" DT release","I was once a hardcore DT fan. I didn't participate in cyber chat or go see millions of shows (lack of money, mabe?) but I did defend DT as the greatest rock band ever to anyone who would listen. I&W was phenomenal, and while Awake was a bit of a disappointment, ACOS brought me back into the fold. FiI now has me asking, have I grown out of my love for DT music?Probably not, unfortunately. Like someone else mentioned, FiI could have been made by pretty much any rock band out there. The lack of progression in a progressive band is evident. Petrucci is still incredible and the music is still challenging, but something is missing - creative tension, perhaps?I&W is still their best album ever. I'm forced to conclude that when Kevin got bored, he took the heart and soul of DT with him."
2,Dream Theater sells out,"To say that Dream Theater sold out is melodramatic, but instead of making their music more radio friendly, the band released a rock album that could have been written by just about anyone. That isn't to say that it doesn't have its highlights, but if you want to hear Dream Theater at its best, stick with Images and Words or Awake."
3,Its just ok,I like Dream Theater. Most of their albums are masterpieces but this one is so different than their best material. only Peruvian skies is a good track (and its more heavy than progressive). This album is definitely for huge Dream Theater fans and collectors. If you are new start with Images and Words.
4,A nice diversion,"I guess most people were expecting another ""Awake"" but DT really surprised me with this cd. At first I didn't care for it too much, and I still think Kevin Shirley stripped the balls out of JP's guitar tone, but after some years the disc has found a place nicely outside the typical DT box and I appreciate it for that. It continues to grow on me. Listen to ""Hell's Kitchen"", a marvelous instrumental."
4,Um... ... a bit unoriginal?,"Don't get me wrong, this CD does have its high points. But none of this is new to me. And I feel it important to recognize what this CD could have been. I feel the long songs didn't have to be so long, and the bad songs didn't have to be there at all. I feel this score should have been a five, but the inspiring moments were tainted by an annoying kind of blandness. And I really wouldn't have noticed if I hadn't listened to the album over again. This is one of those CDs that just loses its sparkle the more you listen to it, and I was afraid to listen to it anymore just to maintain the 7 score. Somehow, I feel it should've been an 8."
4,HP Laptop,"The item is excellent. It has been working perfectly for me.Just that the glossy screen is somewhat of an issue, but apart from that this is excellent."
5,IF YOU WANT TO IMPROVE YOUR HEALTH.,ONE OF THE BEST REASONS TO STAY HEALTHY IS TO WATCH THIS DVD...KNOWLEDGE IS POWER....AND THIS INFORMATION CAN SAVE YOUR LIFE.....ONLY YOU CAN MAKE YOUR DISEASE GO AWAY.......NO MEDICAL DOCTOR HAS THE NUTRITIONAL KNOWLEDGE TO HELP YOU.....THIS INFORMATION THAT YOU WILL LEARN FROM WATCHING ''the miracle of greens''CAN SAVE YOUR LIFE.....
2,Not a good resource for Wild Edibles info,"I am quite disappointed in the sparcity of NEW information offered on this DVD - particularily on Wild Edibles. I feel I got the 'bait and switch' on this purchase, as I expected MUCH more information on Wild Edibles. Instead it's primarily a rehash of the Boutenko family's health restoration story and their shared enthusiasm for, dedication to and promotion of consuming greens, eating raw and drinking smoothies. I appreciate the contributions the Boutenko's have made on these subjects, but I would not recomend the purchase of this DVD."
3,"Good sound, reasonable ensemble, but Weiseenberg is prosaic","This recording form 1960 is in amazingly good osund, and the Italian orchestra, though thin-sounding and far from idomatic in Brahms, is less scrappy than usual. Maag, a light-handed conductor in general, takes a lyrical, easy-going view of the Brahms Second Cto. that may have inspired Weissenberg, a power pianist given t pounding out grand gestures, to tread softer than usual.The contours of this performance are appealing, then, but the interpretation is negligible. Weissenbrg comes close to having nothing to say in this music. He plays correctly, but he avoids very soft and vry loud playing, and his phrasing from bar to bar is totally prosaic. I've rarely heard a Brahms Second that felt as automatic as this. Drama and contrast are absent altogether. There's some nice, restrained playing in the Scherzo, and the finale brings out Weiseenberg's most elegant touch. Otherwise, the fve-star reviewer must hear a magic that eludes me completely."
4,Muslimgauze - 'Hussein Mahmood Jeeb Tehar Gass' (Soleilmoon),"Good, late '90's release from Muslimgauze (who, in fact was one player - Bryn Jones, 1967-1999 who died from a rare blood disease). I remember getting this CD when it first came out, as I recently came across it and decided to seek out info about this 'experimental' artist. Had NO idea Bryn Jones had put out close to a 100 releases of CD's, limited cassettes and singles (did I hear right?). Maybe too experimental for some, but Jones did WHAT he did good. Tunes here I liked the most were the title track, the somewhat mind-bending ""Nazareth Arab"", ""Turkish Purdah"", ""Istanbul"" and the semi-incredible ""Uzi Mahmood 12"". Might possibly do something for fans of Merzbow, Lustmord, Controlled Bleeding and maybe Robert Rich {second guessing}. Check it out."
5,back to the good ole world,"My god, this is good. It sounds like Black Rider. I think Tom's poetry has gotten better and better, more abstract and modern. His ballads are still the sweetest."
4,Worthy of any vinyl collection,"As a young man, I did not know who Tom Waits was or know much about his career until the past year plus. I sampled music from the whole of his career, from Closing Time and now with Bad as Me, and I've found few songs to like in each album, though I find myself more attracted to Tom's music from the past 25 years. Soon as I got my hands on a record player, I knew I had to get to Tom Waits on vinyl and this was the only record by him in the store at the time. I knew I enjoyed stuff from Bone Machine and Mule Variations so I decide to give this one a shot. The opening song Alice is now in my Top 10 Best Tom Wait Songs ever.Tom provides a good mix of jazz, blues, piano music, banjo music, and songs that cannot even be categorized into a single genre. Waits' grizzled voice is both rough and soothing, depending on the tune. I'm glad to have this record."
5,Beautiful....,"This was my first Tom Wait's cd purchase..and now: I'm hooked!The mix of songs is incredible: Some make you smile-(Everything you can Think), some make you want to dance-(Kommienezuepadt)..and others-(No one knows I'm gone), can bring a tear to your eye.HIGHLY Recommended!!"
5,my first waits album,great stuff from start to finish. tom waits proves right here that just because you're getting older doesn't mean your music has to suck. my favorite track off here is Poor Edward. eveything else is great as well. the only complain i would have would be Kommienezuspadt (but damnit. you got to give the guy credit for trying man). i don't know if this is his best album or not (i haven't heard them all yet but i've been happy with the stuff i've heard). the other album he put out Blood Money is very much like this album (and put out at about the same time). i would say to get both of these for sure.
4,More music for grownups,"I have always been a tremendous Tom Waits fan. Over the years, we both got old, and changed. So, I don't want to hear any more wiseass hipster stuff, condescending affection for country music fans and 18 wheelers. That stuff was fine in its time. Now, with Alice (and the other recent work), Waits can be as bleak, and sentimental, poetic and experimental as he wants.Alice has some beautiful lyrics, interesting found sounds (OK, I can do without Kommunieszuspadt), and moving tunes. I was one happy fan when Waits threw out his dogeared copies of On The Road and the old Lord Buckley LPs and started playing Harry Partch, John Cage, and Brecht/Weill while thumbing through Walter Benjamin and Thomas Mann.When he's mined this latest moment for all it's worth, and moves on, I'll gladly follow just to see where he goes."
3,Hmmmmmmmmm.....,"First, I really like Tom Waits. However, after listening to this I am wondering what state of mind I would have to be in to enjoy this stuff. Would I be endangering myself if I hung out with people who like this? It's out there."
2,A devante garde opinion,"Waits has all the appeal of a guy sharpening a saw while singing from the bottom of a well. Music, it would seem as a minimum, should be pleasing to the ear. I listened to this CD once -- beginning to end. I'll never be tempted to again. I'll give him two stars because he is original and now and then he creates a pleasant moment or a clever lyric. It takes a special kind of a person to appreciate Tom Waits -- and I'm not sure whether that is a compliment or not."
1,oompa loompa jive,"German Expressionism meets lullabyes in the worst way. Stileted, boring. Waits rehashes his own melodies and adds some rather uninspired lyrics. But if you read Bukowski and drink Mickey's Big Mouths and smoke unfiltered cigarettes and talk philosophy in bars with Ethan Hawke wannabes, then this is for you!"
3,Two Words: Adam Rich,"I purchased this book for one reason and one reason only... Might's post-mortem tribute to ""Eight is Enough"" star, Adam Rich. Of course, it was just a parody of such tributes and Adam was in on it, but it started one of the better celebrity death rumors to run rampant on the internet.The other articles range from bitingly funny, to mildly amusing, to the kind of pseudo-intellectual stuff written by people who *think* they're a lot more intelligent than everyone around them. It's an interesting mix.Overall... I kept it as a bathroom book. Worth the lettuce if you like eclectic reading and have a decent education. But if you listen to Top 40 radio and love shows like ""Boy Meets World,"" it's probably going to be too weird for you."
4,Wait for the real one,"I recently saw the former editor of Might reading from his book and he mentioned that his new magazine, McSweeney's, would be publishing books, and that one of them would be a 'much, much better' version of this book. He was complaining about how this Shiny book was cheap-looking and that the publisher had screwed up the cover, etc, so McSweeney's would put a new collection together, in a hardcover I think, and it'd be out sometime in the next six months or so. I saw this Shiny book in a store and it did look kind of cheap. Why do they print books with that newsprint type paper? Anyway, I think I'll wait for the real version."
5,"Powerful Stories of Sacred Places at Risk, Defended by Native People","This is a very compelling documentary about Native American struggles to protect places they consider sacred. Every time I watch it I see something new as beautiful visuals and excellent interviews reveal complex conflicts over landscapes we all love - Mt. Shasta, Devils Tower, the Hopi mesas. Lakota scholar Vine Deloria Jr. is the intellectual star of In the Light of Reverence, observing at the end: ""The basic problem is that American society is a 'rights society' not a 'responsibility society.' What you've got is each individual saying, 'Well, I have a right to do this.' Having religious places, and revolving your religion around that, means you are always in contact with the earth, you're responsible for it and to it."" You can get this film from Netflix on DVD. It is a very powerful educational tool in classrooms from 7th grade through college and starts wonderful discussions."
4,Excellent Timing Starter,I would recommend this book to anyone interested in learning the difference between market timing and buy and hold. Filled with data that backs up the case for timing and against buy and hold. This book also has a helpful chapter for web sites and other sources related to the topic.
2,If you expect any real insight vs other trading books,"A lot of wasted pages, and generic stuff written about in other trading books. The title gives impression that there is something special written."
3,"Should be titled ""a beginners guide to market timing""","If you're already a market veteran then there is nothing new here. Seasonals, presidential cycle, valueline 4% with some variations, and moving average systems. He briefly mentions sentiment and breadth indicators but doesn't go into their use. If you're new to market timing then this is a good cliff notes on the well known timing systems.My biggest disappointment was that there was no new or original work here. The results of the systems and their variations were not always in the same format making comparisons difficult. It should have been more consistent.If you're familiar with Yale Hirsch, Sy Harding and the VL 4% model then this is a waste. If you want to get up to speed on market timing then it is a worthwhile book and has a good reference section."
4,One of the Better Market Books,"I have read over 50 books about the market and this book should be in your top five books to read. Whether you are new to investing or a seasoned pro, this book provides useful information that you can directly apply to your investment activities. The author provides excellent background and 'back-testing' proofs of the effectiveness of a number of market timing methodologies. While many of these 'systems' may seem exceedingly simple, my own experience in the market leads me to believe that simple is better --- way better! You will benefit from reading this book whether you follow and use the author's systems or not."
3,Somewhat Dated,"I have owned my copy of this book for nearly a decade. There is some interesting material for reflection, particularly on the personal life of a church planter, that is extremely helpful, but for the most part, the material included seems dated and somehow fails to bridge the gap between providing theory and practical advice for an individual seeking to become a Church Planter."
4,"Excellent value, beautiful fit and finish","I bought one of these on eBay when they first came out because it reminded me of one I borrowed from a friend of mine 25 years ago. I would have to say that it's really beautiful, with a high-gloss finish and gorgeous woodgrain on the back and sides. The tuners work beautifully and hold well. The intonation and action was excellent on mine, but I've heard that some have had to lower the action on theirs. I thought that the thick wood and heavy finish would dampen the sound, but I haven't found that to be the case. It has a brighter sound than my 1951 Harmony baritone, more like a guitar than a ukulele. It's not a Kamaka or Martin, of course, but it's a far cry from one of those $29.00 models."
5,Texas Country,"Wade Bowen shows what country really is and what it should be. With an amazing voice, Bowen is what modern mainstream country has lost. Considerably underated, more people who are Texas Country fans need to take a listen to this and any other alblum by Wade Bowen. This is real country."
5,Get the basics and get them right,"I've been reading the book in order to find out wheter SBS suited the need of my company. I must say that Harry Brelford understands how to communicate hardcore SBS knowledge to a novice like me. The book covers SBS 4.5 going through the different features in a manner, that gives good basic knowledge how to implement SBS 4.5. A very readable book, written with the touch of humor that keeps you reading instead of falling asleep. Good job."
2,It's In Black and White,"Somehow I missed the part where I was informed the book was in black and white. Major disappointment. The lack of color is a big deal. Be warned. Hey don't get me wrong, I love Spider-Man. He's my favorite but I'm letting people know that the book is not in color. I would think that that would be a good thing to know before anyone buys it."
5,Excellent quality print!,"This print is is top quality material, thick paper with terrific print quality. It is the best I have ever purchased. We are very pleased our selection was available and delivered in a timely manner. It was wrapped carefully with tissue paper so the image would not get scuffed."
5,Lila is a Future Star,I recieved the Lila C.D. as a gift from a friend and it is the best in my collection. I think she does really well at singing songs that relate to real situations. She also seems to have alot of fun singing which I believe is a must to be one of the greats and she definetly seems to have that quality. I have seen here in concert once and would gladly see her in concert anytime she is around Va again. I think she is one of the best due to the fact that she has a great voice rather she is singin with musical instruments or without she still sounds great. I really believe she will be one of the biggest stars in the coming decade.
3,"Good music, but not for a teenager","I know that Lila is now almost 18 -- alot older than she was when this CD came out. When she was 14, she recorded many songs that should never have been sang by soneone so young. Where the heck does a 14 year old get off singing songs like ""Almost Over You,"" ""I Feel For You,"" and ""Already Somebody's Lover""!!! The only songs on this CD fitting for that age are ""Yippy Ky Yay"" and ""I Wanna Fall In Love."" Anyway just had to mention that."
4,i love her,"hey i love lila. she is down to earth and a great singer. she is a cheerleader, singer and in the choir. as well as active in school. anyone who thinks that she if flashy is wrong. those of us who go to school with her know that she isnt stuck up or snobby!"
1,Not worth it!!!,"I'm sorry to all you Lila fans out there, but she does not even come close to the talent of LeAnn Rimes!!! This CD is a sorry attempt becoming country's newest teen star. She does not have what it takes, in my opinion, to be a hit. Nice try, Lila!"
1,I feel being deceived,"I bought the book after reading the author's website. Had he displayed even a portion of the Magdalene Gospel, I would not have made the purchase. Reading the text I was very soon convinced that the abovementioned gospel is very late: the practice of calling one St.John or St.Peter was not the first century practice, and the style is also very similar to the late writings.I cannot see how the author makes sense of his ideas.Being unemployed I cannot afford wasting such amount of money, so I want a refund."
2,miss leading,"The ad shows 4 canon ink tanks and only one shipped. The canon number for the tank shipped is BCI-1202 and Cyan in color for me it was the last to run out. I guess I will use it some day. The fact is I still had to reorder the color I actually wanted. VERY POOR AD. Canon ink tank numbers Bci-1201bk, Bci-1202c, Bci-1201m, and Bci-1201y. Get the ad correct!!David"
5,More than meets the eye,"This refers to the book, Venus in Furs, not the essay by Deleuze. I loved this book. Not because I'm some psycho who enjoys pain, but because it tastefully deals with an issue that is too often either misrepresented as some libertine taboo or dealt with in a clinical way. Instead you have a story that deals with love in a different way than a typical Danielle Steele romance novel or a ""boy meets girl,"" sappy drugstore paperback. And while it deals with passionate cruelty it, unlike books by Sade, captures unbridled desire and an inflamed heart. It is truly a great work of literature, easily comparable to ""The Sorrows of Young Werther"" by Goethe.If you like sappy romance stories, buy something else. If you want an intriguing love story full of the passion of life and the strumming of the stings of emotion, read away."
4,A lot to learn,"For those who want to become acquainted with the deepest mysteries of mind and their relationship to behavior, not only sexual, this book is indispensable."
4,strayte thuggin!!!,OK!!! 1st of all i gotta holla at my nigz reppin da 865!!! bout tyme da ville get sum damn noize out there!!! but n e wayz...this cd was jes thuggn!!! its crunk ta death n its worth every penny!!! these bois r gonna b big 1 day!!! n if n e 1 can tell me where i can get ma boi B-Rush's album holla at me!!!this album keeps it crunk n it also has sum tite trakz!!! number 2 is fa' sho' wit it!!! number 4 n number 15 r bangin 2!!! go cop dis!!!
5,Top value,"THerre are many camcorders in the market and many are superior to this one. However you have to pay much more money, In this price range it wouldbe impossible to find a better camcorder. Easy to use with a powerful zoom (better and more powerfull that more expensive camcorders) connects easily to a mac or pc it offerssomething that similar camcorders do not: the possibility to set your manual settings (if you wish to do so) and experiment. For the users that ewant it simple, the auto settings will deliver you an excellent result. Again if you want something more than you should look elsewhere and pay more. But for the price this is the best buy"
3,Cheap and Cheerful until you need it fixed!,"I bought this camcorder back in August last year right after my vacation, not so smart but I needed a new one just didn't act fast enough. That's the lesson I learned here. Although you have a 1 year Parts warranty you only have 90 day for labor. You wouldn't think that would be bad but guess what, it will cost $200 for labor no matter how large or small the job. I unfortunately didn't test the video output through the television until recently when I discovered it wasn't working. I had never used so I'm guessing that it never worked. I tried to explain this to Panasonic service center but they weren't having it. I paid $299 and I cannot see paying $200 to fix something that didn't work in the first place. The moral of the story is, it's a pretty good little camcorder for the money. Just make sure you test every little feature within the ninety days because you'd be better off buying a new one if it goes wrong after that."
3,Good for day light shooting,The video shot with indoor lighting is very poor.I used windows xp's default driver to capture pictures off of the video. The captured pictures are blurred.Microphone is good.All in all performs best in good light situations.
2,It's a starter camera,"So, I bought this camera, and truthfully I really wish I hadn't. I guess the only thing I don't like is even with the light that you can turn on, nighttime shots are really, really poor quality. I don't know what it is about this camera, or many camera's panasonic has put out, but the minute it gets a little dark - FORGET ABOUT IT!Other than that, the battery is long lasting and it truly is really simple to use - I mean no brainer, really!It's small, so I can take it anywhere with me and not think I am carrying something bulky- love to put it in my purse, other than the night thingy, its a fine camera."
1,Bad investment!,"I bought this last Christmas for my husband. Here it is, November of the next year, and we still have trouble using it. It is NOT user-friendly! The connections to PC or TV are not easy, and forget that, just shooting movies are a challenge, especially if inside. There's a lighting feature we still haven't figured out, and apparently we have a lemon, as there are 5 blue bands that span across our movies in playback. Sounds like we're not alone...Also, I can't find any info on the Panasonic website about this model, or it's problems.Buyer beware!"
3,Incomplete review,I'll be doing a more complete review soon but right now I'm having one problem. How do you connect it to your computer via USB Cable? What kind of USB cable is needed? Can anyone maybe help me out to a link here on amazon for a usb cable I would need to get to use it as a web cam.
1,Piece of junk,"I bought this from another retailer on ""black Friday"" for half of what Amazon is selling it for and I'm still bringing it back. I think it's horrible. I was so excited to get a mini-dv camcorder because I heard how great the picture was, but this takes horrible video. It comes out so dark that you can hardly see anything, even using the light. Even in a fairly well-lit room it came out dark. It looked Ok on the lcd screen, but when I hooked it up to the TV, horrible! And it's not my TV either because I hooked up my old camcorder and it looked fine. I love that it's so small, but if I can't see the video, it's no use to me. Back to by big old Sony!"
1,Reading Galaxy,The CD cannot be used with monitors that use more than 240 ..of color./the product is useless for todays computers
2,eh...,"I'm new to RIO, so when I heard everyone comparing Univers Zero to Bartok and Stravinsky, I was very excited. However, this music, for all its harmonic complexity, lacks the rhythmic imagination and vitality that those two had. The sound seems rather thin to me, too. My advice is, just go listen to Bartok and Stravinsky, or even Martinu and Honegger. They're better than these guys."
5,simply incredible tea,"I thought that I was fairly well informed about tea. I have been ordering loose teas from England for 35 years. I have had some of the best teas (I thought). I saw this listing and was stunned by the price. I said: that stuff is the most expensive tea I have ever seen. It must be good! So, I ordered it. These flowering tea tips are like little crystaline jewels. I steeped a couple and they bloomed in the water. The resulting brew was heavenly. Picture Chinese imperial court level tea. Incredible. Do you think that you have had the best tea? If you haven't experienced this stuff your horizons are ready to expand. Unreal. Such quality. Such flavor. Worth every penny!"
5,The 16-Bar Theatre Audition Book,"Although I have not actually auditioned using this book, I was impressed with the songs included in the book . . . nice variety. Also, I am a 2nd soprano at best and the songs are very much in my range. The vocal arrangements are such that you can easily demonstrate your talents in 16 bars. I will definitely be using it in future auditions."
4,Decent,"I like the book alot and find that it has helped me a great deal. Although I wish it had some more current Broadway shows, such as Wicked, Hairspray or even Thoroughly Modern Millie."
5,Valuable asset,"This book is a great thing to have for anyone involved in the world of theatre. It does the hard work of picking out a crucial 16-bar piece of a song for you! Great for auditions. The book has selections from musicals (old and new, familiar and rare), as well as movies (even some Disney!). There's one for every vocal part. Granted, not every piece is exactly 16 bars. Some go a bit over, but this is usually excusable due to proper phrasing. It's well worth looking into for those who are just starting out. It's also a way of introducing yourself to a variety of musicals."
5,ahh Manhattan,"Melanie's latest adventure in Manhattan is, perhaps, her best yet. It is enjoyable to recognize all the places she visits, such as the Frick, Central Park, and Zabar's. Any New Yorker will relate immediately to Melanie's experiences, while girls from all over will be given the best tour possible while eagerly following (and identifying with) the difficulties the heroine faces in having a crush on two boys at once."
5,john stockton rules!,"I bought this for my boyfriend who is a huge Utah Jazz fan. John Stockton is his favorite player of all time, so he was thrilled! The toy arrived quickly and safely! Very happy!"
3,Cute drawings for a very young child,"I adore Rosemary Wells and so do my twin toddlers. But I think this is one of those books ""inspired by"" Rosemary Wells. It is just not as hilarious and unpredictable as some of the other books. My girls like it but I wouldn't put it at the top of my Wells reading list."
1,I thought better than this,"I live in Japan and trying to get to know about people and culture. I heard about Ghost sometimes ago but I never had listened to their music. So, once on Amazon, I read some positive revues about this cd and I decided to buy it. Fortunately, I bought it used, so It didn't cost very much, because this record is very ugly. When I started playing it I listened to the first song and I thought:well, let's give them another chance with the next song. But, this kind of music is very old and unfashinating, and they sing in a very terrible way."
2,Acceptable for the price paid,"I got this router around 2 years ago (v2 version) and it worked pretty well most of the time. There were occasions when it would just stop working, and it took multiple reboots of the router and cable modem to get things going right again; fortunately this was pretty infrequent. When I moved and changed to another service provider, this router just would not work right. Nothing I tried would fix the slow and almost nonexistant connection it gave me; I ended up replacing it."
2,"When it works, its great !!!","Got the Mr814 from Amazon, which shipped it in record time (Tnx Amazon). I got the white unit which is Ver3 and comes with the latest firmware from Netgear.very easy to setup and install, stylish and compact. However the BIGGESt problem with this thing, is it drops the internet conncetion every about tenminutes !!! A search on the net has revealed this to be a common problem, and is very annoying. tryed several suggestions found on the net, but none did the trick.I think you cud do better elsewhere, especially that this issue has been found since earlier versions and continues on in the latest versions as well."
5,Worked great out of the box,"This router worked very well out of the box. I have no idea how to set these things up, but the router came with an easy-to-follow quickstart card. I timed myself, and I had the router installed and was on the internet in less than 5 minutes. My separate laptop was on wireless in the next room in less than 15 minutes.Signal is strong throughout my house and quite a ways outside. I suspect I'll be providing wireless to my neighbors for a while until I figure the security functions out.I really have no complaints, the instructions were easy to follow (and I didn't have any weird setup issues)."
2,Connectivity is the main drawback,The Netgear MR814 802.11b Wireless 4-Port Cable/DSL Router is very easy to set up and required no software. I like the Firewalls and parental control options that this router provides. Internet accessible from anywhere at home. And it is compatible with both Windows and Mac. The antenna for this model is 2DB. Though the router was easy to set up I had some difficulties in configuring it to my settings. There have been numerous instances when the connection dropped and I had to reset the router for it to function properly. This frequency of loss of connectivity is an unhealthy sign.
5,great,the product works exactly like what i was told.would buy it agian.came in the mail quicker than expected.
5,Still ticking after 6 years,"I bought this as my first ever wireless router in 2003 along with a Netgear MA401 802.11b card for my laptop. I upgraded a year or two later to the identical looking 802.11g router for myself since I was please with this product. I then hooked this router in my parents home so they would have a wireless network. Four years later, and it's still working just fine for them. So needless to say, this was a great purchase."
2,MR 814 Doesn't Hold Up,Bought the MR 814 and within 2 years it's antenna or transmitting capability died. Netgear replaced it with the same model since it was under warranty. 3 years later it's dieing again. Not under warranty. It's used constantly so not sure if it just burns out or what. Used all day long on one iMac and then by additional Mac and Windows PC as well as iTouch.It now transmits intermittently and occassionally will just stop transmitting. Unplugging it seems to help it regain it's transmitting power. Started with Lynksys originally but could not get it to work with Windows PC. That's how I ended up with Netgear. It was pretty much plug and play.
2,NETGEAR MR814 v1 & v2: sheer age factor makes it bad choice,"This product is too old to use safely. Why? One of many reasons being that -- e.g. the sensitive fields (such as where your DSL account password gets entered, and even admin password field) on this rather (old/ancient) wireless gear saves to a .bin(ary) file in clear-text. Just like all the ancient Linksys models, if you ever enable the remote management option on this thing, it won't force you to change the default password. Not good.."
2,Buy a Linksys,"I bought this item last weekend and returned it this weekend. It was easy enough to set up, but it ran very slow. I spent a lot of time doing research and getting help from the computer geeks at work, but could not come up with a solution to the slowness. I spent a little more on a Linksys WRT54G today, and am very happy. I still only use the .11b, but it is alot faster."
4,Great Router!,"First off, there are two versions of this router, v1 and v2. I received the v2 router. This router is good in many aspects. It has excellent security options; there is a built-in firewall, WEP encryption, and it allows you to filter wireless access by MAC address; alternatively you can disable wireless access completely. You can also block Internet Access and/or service (MSN Messenger, Yahoo, etc.) completely or by a time schedule. The router also supports blocking sites by keyword and/or URL. One thing I find useless is the logs, it only logs sites visited, not very useful if your concerned about security. It performs well, I haven't had to reboot it once in the few months I've had it. Overall it's a great router."
2,Wireless Feature touchy at best,"I previously owned the Netgear 614 router, and was pleased enough with the performance and ease of operation to upgrade to this model for the wireless features. While the basic features of the router remain solid, I've been extrememly disapointed with the wireless feature. Like one of the other reviewers, the signal seems to drop sporatically. This is not interferance, the router must be rebooted in order to get the signal back..."
2,Connection problems getting worse,"Got this in December of 2002. It worked quite well for 9 months, although the port-forwarding feature is iffy at best. Nice amount of parental controls (ie:block undesirable websites by url or keyword). I live in an area with at least 4 other wireless networks and I have restricted mine by MAC address so only my 2 computers can use it. Fairly good range on the wireless area.Despite the good points, after 9 months the Netgear starting dropping the wireless signal. After several firmware updates, it ran sporadic, but acceptable. Then after 11 months starting dropping the entire internet connection, requiring frequent reboots, often times several reboots in a row in order to get it to connect. I'm now using an ""special"" beta firmware (4.14 RC3) in order to address the problem. The last beta firmware lasted only 3 days before giving out, but I'm hoping better from this.I would not recommend this router."
4,It doesn't disconnect from the wireless constantly,"Previous to this, I had bought a d-link router which no matter how many times I flashed its firmware, would just constantly connect and disconnect anything hooked into its network, even if the computer was right next to the router. Initially this router did that, but then I upgraded its firmware, and it got better. Then I upgraded its firmware to the beta version available on their website and no longer had problems with things disconnecting.I haven't tested it's range 'cause I'm using it in an apartment."
2,Not a good wireless router!,This netgear MR814 is a good wired router but not a good wireless router. Major problem is that I need to keep rebooting the adapter every 30 minutes as it drops my laptop connection but it performs well for a wired LAN and its cheap. I guess you get what you pay for.I am going to return this and buy a D-Link.
1,WEP doesn't work all the time,WEP sucks. Contacted tech support. They suck too... Awh well. Buying a LinkSys...
3,Get a newer router...,"I've been using this router for about a year now. I've had to exchange it once, and have spent hours trying to fix inexplicable problems. It works ok for now, but with occasional problems and mandatory resets.If you choose this router, MAKE SURE YOU BUY THE ONE THAT SAYS ""v2"" after it. Netgear realized they made so many mistakes in the first product, that they made a new version that actually works."
1,I thought it was great....,"I thought it worked great until I tried using it for more than half an hour. I upgraded the firmware, too.anyways, like every half hour, connection drops. I have to unplug the router and restart everything to make it work again. It's annoying. Someone else also mentions this on the review so obviously it's not just me. I called NetGear. I got a ticket number for the 2nd level technician to call me back, but I didn't hear a thing back from them. I'm returning this. Don't waste your time. I heard LinkSys works great, but I wouldn't know for sure."
4,just one too many features,"There aren't any technical flaws in the router that I've found, heard about or otherwise experienced. It works just like it's supposed to. The feature I don't like is it keeps a record of everywhere you go on the web, which can be emailed to anywhere, automatically, or checked from the router. This means, were somebody else to have the password, they can check on my internet activities, which include a huge list of adult sites. That's what the feature is for, but I hate it."
3,"Do your homework on support first, then choose the hardware","Although this has been well recommended by many authoritative reviewers, I had no success at all connecting this with an Apple G4 laptop with built in Airport. Tech support from Netgear was limited to only the most rudimentary suggestions before they required paid support to take over.DSL Provider only supports 2-Wire brand for wireless assist and Apple couldn't resolve the connection issue. So, although It works fine with the routing of wired connections, you need to be certain you can get help if wireless doesn't interface."
1,POS,"Bought this back in march to replace an aging linksys BEFW11SR. I was thrilled at first. I plugged it in, did the initial configuration and it worked. 6 weeks later I couldn't access the internet - initial thought was to reboot everything. So I did and still nothing worked. Put linksys router back in and everything worked just fine. Never buy Net gear again. I would give it 0 stars but thats not an option. UNFORTUNATELY!"
2,Fast but HORRIBLE Signal Strength,"This router was fairly easy to connect to my Ibook running Mac OS X. However, that was due to my Mac automatically recognizing the router, because the included software to set up the Router did not run on my computer. Once running the connection seemed to drop regularly, or at least such applications as AIM and MSN were constantly restarting. The speed was very satisfactory, running just as fast as I was when I was connected directly to my dsl modem. HOWEVER, I can not even leave the room that the router is in without losing my signal completely. If I put one single wall between my computer and my router then I do not receive any signal AT ALL. I don't know how these other users are getting such a great signal, I wish I did though!"
1,Poor signal strength makes this virtually worthless,I've had this router for a couple of months now and am sorely disappointed by its lack of signal strength. I originally had it in my office but my laptop would lose signal when I was about 10 feet away. I had to move it out to a hallway and even then it only has an effective signal when it is in line of site and within 20 feet or so. I'm in the process of looking to replace this door stopper with something useful.
3,Huge AC adapter that works only for 120V,"Linksys and D-Link come with an AC adapter that works for 100-120V, but this one's works only with 120V. Also, it is so bulky that it cannot go into the middle of the power strip without wasting a few outlets. Since there are a few routers out there which are pretty much identical in functionalities, I thought somebody may find a point like this help making their decisions."
1,Not a good router,Shitty router. Very bad connection. Drops signal all the time. Have to turn it off and on couple of times a day to make it work.
1,Poor Choice,"This item was dead on arrive. After calling 2 ""techs"" that didn't solve the problem, I gave up. Don't buy it!"
1,This is Terrible!,"When I got this item and install on my cable modem. I found my IBM-X31 can successfully connect to the Internet. However, I restart my computer and let it connect to this router automatically, it failed. I tried to upgrade its firmware in order to enhance the stability, it failed again. And all I need to do is return to the store....."
1,Don't waste your money,"This router worked great for the first hour or two, and then the problems began. The wireless feature quit working (which after reading some reviews on here and elsewhere on the internet, I discovered is from the router overheating.) After a few days of using it as a wired router (since I had given up on the wireless), I smelled something electrical overheating or burning which turned out to be this router. (...)"
1,"narrowband router, reeeeeeeeeeeeeealy slow","I thought broadband is the same as dialup when I access Internet through this defective router...after many hours trying to fix it,I finally disconnect it from the modem and connect my PC directly to cable modem, WOW, now I know what broad-band is."
2,Has its drawbacks..,"I bought the MR814 a month ago .. as many reviewers said, it's easy to set up, and has good range. But I have been disappointed with it and will probably buy something else.Why? First off, it drops TCP/IP connections that are inactive for more than a few minutes. This is really annoying, since it drops telnet connections quite rapidly .. this behavior is for both the wired and wireless ports.Second, it needs to be powered off and on at least once a day, as it will start slowing down, not retrieving tcpip connections, and a quick power off/on cycle seems to fix the matter.So in the end, while it's easy to setup and has good range, I cannot recommend this router because of the above problems."
1,Router works well...but DON'T EXPECT TO SEE THE REBATE,Title says it all. My experience with the router has been completely positive. I'm still now 20 weeks into getting the rebate....had to call and ask for it after 16 weeks .... now the 'www.wheresmyrebate.com' says its mailed....but of course three weeks later its not here. No matter how good the product this is NOT WORTH THE HASSLE unless you enjoy being stiffed.
2,get the linksys router,"I was very disappointed with this router. I had just installed an old Linksys wireless router for a friend, but decided to get a Netgear router since it was on sale. The old Linksys router had a lot more configuration options than this router. Out of the box, it doesn't offer the ability to switch off broadcasting the SSID. You have to upgrade the firmware to be able to do that. Even then, you can't turn the wireless radio off, like you can with the Linksys. For security-conscious folks, turning off wireless when you're not using it is like locking your door when you leave home.So, compared to the Linksys router, the Netgear is definitely lacking. The range on this router also does not seem as good as I what I had with the older Linksys router."
4,Good One,"Simple , easy, elegent tooo use.I had the setup completed in less than 20 minutes for installation on a desktop and laptop and works like a charm.. never had a dropped connection..i am still to check the range of the router."
1,Money down the toilet.....,"Bought 2 of these pieces of junk with one montht difference, one for me and one for for my sister's place. Both started to drop wireless connections after 2 months use with increasing frequence until wireless feature is down most of the time. Firmware updates are just placebos, won't improve anything!!Customer support are just dummies reading through scripts assuming you're utterly stupid and forgot to plug to the power or so. Rebates are a bad joke!!! 4 months and I got no money back on either!!! and I'm not going to expect them to honor the warranty, so they'll end up leveling some table.SAVE YOURSELF SOME MONEY BY SPENDING A FEW EXTRA BUCKS ON SOME OTHER BRAND!!!!"
4,easy to use,I have purchased a couple of these and have had no problems. Very easy set-up with no problems. When I have had to call support they were very helpful. A much better experience than friends have had with other brands of routers!
1,Just did not work,The router wireless connection got disconnected every few hours. After Netgear techicain send me a software update the router just stopped work completely.
4,Cheap decent wireless router!,"i order this for $35 after mail-in rebate. i think it's a awesome router. the only downside is that the connection lag every once a while, not a good idea for online gamers. it looks very sleek and sets up very easily. great router overall."
4,Don't buy the Microsoft wireless!,"I have Netgear in my apartment in NYC and had a problem with remote access because of a microwave and large fridge. Thought I would go with Microsoft as it got good reviews and I had a three story area to cover in the country. Six attempts at my PC (Win98) recognizing the router failed. Called Tech support...waited 30 minutes...got a ""case number""....waited in vain for 1.5 HOURS! Finally gave up, returned the Microsoft product and got Netgear MMR814v2. Up and running in 15 minutes and no tech support. Just had to change the name of the network from the one in the city. Am not sure of the coverage distance but at least I have one floor below where I am wireless. The v2 is smaller than the one I have in NYC and attractive. Forget Microsoft and go with this one. I usually don't write this but all of the Netgear reviews convinced me to buy... I owe some one out there a thanks for aiming me towards this product."
3,Security concerns,"Remember, that if you live in an urban environment, a unit like this exposes you to possible identity theft. The security features need to be more user-friendly. People are just not using them and they are getting hurt."
2,poor wireless connectivity. excellent wired router,"as a wired router, it is beautiful and great. works superb.i tried everything possible, distances from 2 feet to 50 feet, the connection DROPS all the time, in WinXP and Win2k.I was able to remove the annoying messages that the connection was dropped, but nevertheless connection drops very often and internet is getting slow, very slow at moments.Don't buy NETGEAR router for wireless, it sucks!Don't buy Belkin router wired or wireless, it's a tragedy."
3,"Nice, but not scalable","This has a much better configuration interface than the linksys product but it won't talk to other Wireless Access Points. If you're planning to use wireless in a large area, this isn't the one for you.I bought this to add to my existing wireless network, but there's no way for it to acknowledge that another wireless network already exists and join to it. This is per their tech support, who were at least competent and rapid in their response, even if I didn't like the answer."
1,poor customer support,"Installing wireless networks reminds me of software installs 10-12 years ago. You had to fiddle around with a lot of stuff and things did not work smoothly from the get go. At the first install the MR814 did no seem to ""see"" my cable modem. Kept asking for a static IP address even though there was none. This is the point where you find out about product support. For me there was none. I tried calling their ""7/24"" number and was kept on hold till I ran out of patience--twice. Sent them an email and got a standard response asking me to turn everything off and on and reset the router. That failed again and they did not respond to subsequent emails. Finally the powers of Google and user groups came through and I found that I had to reset the cable modem since I had used it with a different router earlier. Since then I have had internet connectivity. But I have been dissatisfied with customer service and would not have minded paying more if that had meant better support."
2,You Get What You Pay For,"I recently replaced my Linksys BEFSR14 and Airport Base Station with one of these MR814. I'm happy that I got it for this price, since it really is a pretty lousy router.I say this because the NAT is braindead. I happen to run a Virtual Hosted web server behind the router. The router can't handle it (refuses the connection immediately), you have to use a public web proxy or muck up DNS just to see your own site ! Netgear support confirmed this problem but have been dead silent since I asked them when they intend to fix it. Likely they do not.If you can get this router cheap and are strapped for cash, go for it, but be prepared for troubles if you ever want to run a public server through it. If you're looking for reliable home networking products without any misfeatures, stick with Linksys. There's a reason Netgear is giving rebates and the retail stores are dumping inventory. It's an also-ran."
3,Not compatible with Airport Extreme (MR814v2),Just a word of caution to Mac folks who are using aluminum PowerBooks: the Netgear MR814v2 router is incompatible with Airport Extreme. But it works flawlessly with the older Airport cards. Netgear tech support hasn't gotten back to me yet regarding possible solutions. Might have to exchange the router with a Linksys instead.
2,Great--if the chipset didn't keep overheating,"Great piece of hardware--very configureable. I especially appreciate the option to set the MAC address for the internet side, because my ISP will only give out IP's over DHCP to the MAC address I originally supplied. I got it set up in minutes and used it for 3 days straight without problems. Then it stopped working for no apparent reason. Unplugged it briefly, tried again. No luck. Unplugged it for the night, and it worked the next day... for an hour or so. Basically, something inside is overheating. I have to leave it unplugged for several hours before it will work again. No wonder netgear is ditching these at such a low price--there is a major engineering slip-up."
4,Pretty good router,"I've been pretty happy with this one for about a year now. Rarely drops wireless connections.It does, however, lock up pretty frequently if I use certain streaming connections, and it only affords 20 firewall port exclusions. That should be plenty for most people, unless you play a lot of online games, I suspect. Once it locks up it must be un/replugged to get any network activity at all.Other than that, a great router.Several other problems are easily fixed by updating to the latest firmware at Netgear's website."
2,Lots of wasted time,"What a beautiful product- I just wish it worked half as good as it looks. I was very disappointed when, after spending about 4 hours + assistance from their technical support, was still not able to get the wireless feature to work properly. I had a lot of issues with my ISP telling me my problem was a router problem and Netgear technical support telling me it was a problem with my ISP. I finally decided, reluctantly, to pack it up and ship it back to Amazon and continue using my older two device system which I never had problems with. I really think the wireless feature of the unit was defective."
4,mr814,"The MR814 is pretty good for anyone at a tight budget. The tech support is bad, but if you can live through that, this router works as fine and dandy as any other. It uses a SMC reverse connector for those who are wondering if you want to add an antenna to it. Works okay. If your internet goes down alot, this router can suck trying to reconnect. (I'm on dsl, goes down when it rains, takes the router forever to figure how to get back online)Anyways, overall, its pretty good. The signal is pretty strong for the price so I won't argue about that."
2,"2dbi, not 5!","The previous MR814 cranked out 5dbi, but v.2 quitely reduced that to 2dbi (much weaker, which means less range.) Also, the antenna is not removable, so you can do nothing about the limitation..."
2,Do not waste your time or money on this one,"This router has some problems. The DHCP implementation does not follow standards, as a result, some CompactFlash Wi-Fi adapter cards will not work with this router. The keyword blocking feature does not work in the firmware upgrades 4.13 and higher. After firmware upgrade, the router stops generating access logs, the empty logs are not e-mailed as per schedule and the router stops showing the attached devices. Technical support is extremely poor, with no solutions to the problem and long hold times. Aside from these problems, it is really a great product!!"
2,Warning - research and see if it works with your card first!,"This product looks slick, setup is easy and works great for wired connections. However, I still can't get the wireless to work correctly with a new Centrino notebook. After the fact, I found lots of others having the same problem - it disconnects every 20 minutes or so. I don't have these problems on other access points with my laptop. check out [website]for all the details around this.tech support is not much help either - and the wait is long. On different calls, the wait times have been quoted as 160 minutes down to a minimum of 40 minutes. And they couldn't help once I waited to get through."
1,Don't buy it,"After three months, this router became unreliable. Tech supports try to help me out but this router requires refurbish. Considering the amount I spend on this router, this isn't worthy."
2,Decent Product; Non-existent Customer Service,"This product worked well for about 1 year, then it crapped out. Tried calling customer service on several occasions with no luck; the service line hangs up on me each time. Stay away from this company unless you want to take your chances."
1,nice design but shabby perormance,"set up was complicated. i say get the d-link 604 router instead. however, if you get a netgear wireless card, it'll get detected automatically."
2,Device fails with WEP enabled.,"Do not buy this device if you want to use WEP. Apparently it is unable to encrypt/decrypt the amount of information necessary. Netgear's solution is to have the device reset itself when it becomes overloaded. This is a terrible way to try and fix the problem, and leaves you with a continually stalling network, which is upsetting if you like to do things like stream internet radio. Also, with WEP enabled, file sharing is incredibly slow, to the point of being useless. If you are content with MAC address filtering and disabling SSID broadcast for your security, then the router works fine. Otherwise, look elsewhere for a more competent device."
2,Netgear MR814v2 - not worth the hassle,"Well, you've probably already read this a thousand times, but the router is totally usless. Configuration is simple, however none of this matters if it can't hold a wireless connection longer than 30 minutes. I'm using a Gateway laptop with a built in Centrino and have had nothing but problems keeping it connected. I've uploaded firmware, changed channels, tweaked adapter settings, you name it doesn't work. I'm happy for those of you who've gotten it to work, but my recommendation is to look elsewhere. I'll be purchasing a different brand tomorrow, which I'll review as well."
4,Great Product,I've been using this router for 3 months now and it has worked flawlessly. It's extremely easy to set up and configure. I would definitely recommend it.
4,"Cheap, expandable, and easy to use","I bought this as my ""traveling router"" to go with me to Hotels, friends houses, abroad, etc... wireless everywhere. It is small, robust, friendly, and will guarantee you get your bag searched at the airport every time!The antenna is removeable and uses the standard RPSMA adapters so that you can plug in high gain antennas with a small cheap pigtail... this is a great cheap router."
2,Too many drops,"The setup of this product was super easy. The biggest problem is that the wireless connection drops like crazy, every minute or so, even though the signal is rated excellent (the laptop actually sits next to the router). The fixed line desktop doesn't experience this problem."
3,Range is Poor but works well,"I was very displeased with the range of this product. I live in a 600sq ft apt and the farthest I am ever away from the product is 30 ft. The second a wall pops up (im talking about those paper thin, non loadbearing apt walls) the signal strength drops. Two walls and signal strength drops to low. All while I am only 30 ft away. I sincerely do not believe the claim of 500 ft range. other than that, XP pro hooked up the components within 5 minutes and effortlessly."
4,Great Value,I had no problems connecting this wireless router to Comcast Cable. Automatic. Easy. Fast. Checked out the wireless functionality with Palm Tungsten C WiFi with no problems. Acceptable range. Great value for the money. Don't know why people have problems getting this router up and running.
5,Overall Great Product,"This product looks and works great!!! Its easy to use and setup and configure. It took me less than 5 minutes to setup and start surfing wirelessly. It has acceptable range. I have also tried the Micrsoft Wireless, but I am alot more satisfied with this product. There are no software needed unlike Microsft. I have done some researching and price watching, and I have found this to be by far the best deal. I got mine for [$$] after rebate!!! Great!! Overall I am very satisfied with this Netgear Wireless."
5,Works great and the price is right. Get it.,"I bought this wireless router about 6 months ago and have not had experienced any problems at all, and I use my laptop daily at home. The link quality is excellent all through my house and in the backyard. I do have a small house, though (1600 sq ft). Don't have any issues to report as never had to reboot or troubleshoot in any way. Installation was piece of cake too.I'm very pleased with this Netgear router. And you can't beat the price. Give it 5 stars."
3,No true firewall,MR814 does not support SPI(statefull packet inspection). It just provides NAT which is not a true firewall. If you are looking more secure router you should go for Netgear MR814 V2. The V2 has SPI support
3,"Not too bad, but the support is awful","Did a firmware upgrade on this darling, and found to my chagrin that I couldn't configure the router (I don't use it for broadband access, so there isn't anything on the ""internet"" port). The config assistant ""helps"" you by actively hiding the ""basic"" configuration options until you configure the router, which you CAN'T if you don't have anything hooked to the ""Internet"" port.Managed to get the URL for the basic settings page by hooking a PC to the ""internet"" port. But this shouldn't be necessary -- and what if you DON't have a second machine to do this with?"
3,drops every 2 or 3 mintues with Encryption enabled.,"If I don't enable encryption, it works fine. But after I did, drops every 2 or 3 mintues, so often. It is not right. All other brands, like Belkin, D-link, all have this issue. I don't know how to figure out. If anyone knows how to fix it, please contact me at john0341@hotmail.com."
3,Wireless connection unstable; cheap; Interface is nice,"My wireless connection drops from time to time after connected for more than 2 hours or so. Router needs to be reset by pulling the power plug. I used both Linksys and Netgear, and I found the web interface offered by Netgear is more intuitive. Unfortunately the wireless connection did not work well with my Orinoco wireless card. For $$$ dollars it's good for casual users. Not recommended for heavy duty or professional users."
1,Disconnect in every 30 minutes,"when more then 1 pc is connected, who have such experience too? is this problem common?since the price is incridible, i decide to buy it again."
4,no problems,"other than the occasional firmware update, it hasn't given me any trouble. i've had it for almost a year and it works great."
4,"Easy Setup, range is excellent, great price","Never had a network go up without some little hitch along the way before...this was 1-2-3. The router is in the basement of a three-story house, but measured throughput is the same (give or take a few kbits) in the kids' bedroom upstairs as it was for the pc downstairs, when it was the sole broadband connection. Some people say in their reviews they're not getting that kind of range...the problem might be in their PC's net adapter (I'm using two Netgear MA111 802.11b Wireless USB Adapters...don't pay more for a PCMCIA card if your laptop has USB, these are great!), or possibly a protocol conflict (I used to do tech support for an ISP, half the real problems were resolved by removing then reinstalling the network protocols correctly). You can see this router elsewhere for 10-20 dollars more. Couldn't be happier, but I am shy of giving it five stars -- if it still works a year from now without hassles, I'll mentally add one..."
3,Easy to set up!,"I've had this router for about 9 months now. It's very easy to setup and maintain. It has a remote access feature that allows you to reconfigure the router remotely.The only drawback is that this router is not very tolerant of file sharing software. It frequently locks up despite severely limiting numbers of connections.If you intend to use file sharing software, get something else. Otherwise, this is a great router."
1,Burned up,"Worked fine for about 12 hours, then apparently burned itself up with a noticeable smell. Now the power light wont even come on. Now I know why Netgear is getting rid of these so cheap."
1,Netgear Quality Control Issues,"After reading many reviews saying that the MR814 was a good wireless router and easy to setup, I purchased one from Amazon for a great price. It did setup super easy. Unfortunately, after being powered on for a few hours, it appears to heat up and have a component failure that makes it stop communicating with the cable modem. I have found many many forum's since saying they have had the same failure. Even looks like Netgear may have dumped the bad units on Amazon. After completing all the troubleshooting guides, and then running through the same with the hard to understand Netgear staff, the unit is being replaced by Netgear. We'll see if the second unit works better. Too bad they used cheap components, otherwise the router would be the best for the money."
1,Horrible router DO NOT buy!!,"I've had the router for a little over four months. It constantly freezes and has to be rebooted or hard started. If you try online gaming it stops about every couple of hours. Tried my DSL without the router and it works great. Take a little advice if your looking for a wireless router and are considering Netgear, KEEP LOOKING!!"
3,"not broken yet, but close to it ...","My experience with netgear products are good, but with this box, it seems that I get disconnected a lot, which is not the case when I had my D-Link AirPlus DI-614+. Too bad I downgraded. Just thought a new router would be better, but it isn't."
1,Good for about 6 months,"I bought this router last year and it was working fine. But for the last 3 weeks the router is a piece of crap. It connects to the internet through the LAN, but when it comes to wireless it is as slow as a modem. And that too it works for only 15 minutes and then drops the connection. I have spent at least 6 hours on the phone with Netgear support and they are not helpful. They kepp telling me the same thing over and over again. I have told them that it works for only 15-20 minutes and that too at a modem speed. When they send you a replacement, it is a refurbished one which someone else had sent in to Netgear with problems and obviously that has problems too."
1,142 out of 682 reviews gave the product one star!!!,"Given my 1-star rating, it has an astonishing 21% dissatisfaction rate. What else need to be said about it? Really not much, but I do want to share my own experience.This is no doubt the hardward I have had most problems, and hence frustrations, with. After I had given up the router (I am now connecting to my DSL modem directly), I decided to come here and see what other people have to say about it. With little surprise, I found out a lot of them experienced the same.When it works, it may work great for a quite a while. However, it may stop working all a sudden, or when you have to restart it (power outrage, moving etc.). Several times, I had struggled but managed to reset the network; this time, it completely died on me, without responding even to wired connection.I give up, seriously. It has consumed way more time and effort than what a piece of $30 hardware really should. I am shopping for a new router, and will never buy anything from Netgear."
1,Unreliable connections - buy something else,"Connections are extremely unreliable - will break every 15-30 minutes and won't reconnect till you reboot the router (despite having set all the properties). My older Belkin router never gave me any problems and I have switched back to my older router. Plus, customer service sucks : they will just give you some vanilla suggestions - such as go to this URL and upgrade the router and you will get the same response all the time (and the URLs dont work some of the times)."
2,Not good,"All I can say about this router its not build to last more than 5 or 6 months, and then the wireless feature died all the sudden. I will not recommend this router to anyone"
3,Comment by Grouchy on Apple Extreme Card.,"Just to correct the obvious - hundreds of thousands of Apple Extreme Cards are being used - and its very likely many are being used more than 20 feet from a router! Dont spread FUD...I have a an iBook G4 with Apple Extreme and it does fine even in the basement of our home - where the router is on the top floor. Our office has 30 Powerbooks - all with Extreme cards - and we roam all around our building with very few weak spots.Netgear makes solid products but their user-interface is usually lacking and definitely not Mac centric. SMC is a better product IMHO - but if you are an Apple user, plunk the money for an Apple Airport - especially 802.11b's are available for about $50 on ebay and they are worth it!This one could be my back up!AM"
4,Great Value,"The Netgear MR814 is a great value for this price range. This router took almost no configuring to set up. I have 3 desktops (win 98se, win2k) plugged into the ethernet ports and 2 laptops (win 98, mac os x) and 2 pocket pcs connected wirelessly with 128bit encryption.My only complaints are that it doesn't have SPI for better security, but it does come with firewall software for PCs (but there is no version for Macintosh). Also, there is no built in print server. If you are looking for these features check out the SMC SMC7004VWBR Barricade Wireless 4-Port Cable/DSL Router.Overall, the ease of setup and flexibility make it one of the best values in it's price range."
1,"bad product, do not buy.","Bought the router at sale price for a friend. After reset, it only works for a few minutes before dropping off. Tried all kinds of firmwears from Netgear website, no use. Spent hours trying to coax it to work and reaching custormer service before finally giving up on the product.Overall, it's a bad. A waste of money even at 1 cent."
5,"So easy, so ..., So Great","I was alittle weary about setting this up in my home because i'm not exactly a computer genius. But I just took it out of the box, plugged everything thing, and had it working in matter of minutes. The directions were easy to follow. I put it in the center of my basement, and I didn't even have to fool around with the rabbit ear. I get great reception all the way up to the second floor. I would definitely recommend this product if you want wireless in your house, especially at such a low price!"
4,PPTP in Europe works fine,"Just a word about using PPTP. Another review said that it doesn't work with PPTP protocol used in Europe. When I did the installation using the wizard on the CD, the MR814 determined that the ISP here uses PPTP and just asked for the user name and password. I think that the installion worked flawlessly"
3,Attention: This router is no longer supported,"First it's a great router, and from what I read the range is one of the best. That said, it has a bug: If you leave connections idle it will autmotically close them. Since I use this router for my work, it means I have to constantly reconnect to various servers (using SSH, Database admin program, etc.). That's when I found out the last official BIOS is from September of last year! Netgear released a V2 version of the router and they're no longer supporting this one (V1).Other than the above mentioned bug, the router works great. Easy to setup, works with PPoE in Europe, etc. For people that complain about the signal and/or range, try changing the channel. The default for France is channel 11 and I got poor signals. I set the region to Europe and channel 1 and my signal is excellent in another room through two solid concrete walls."
4,Great product,"I have been using Netgear MR814 802.11b for the last 5 months. It is a great product. The web base admin was straight forward and easy to set up. All standard features (MAC filter, 128bit encryption, etc.) are all there. The range is also a big improvement vs. the D-Link Router that I bought and returned within 2 hours of usage. The only problem I have so far with this router is once a while (a long while so) it will somehow crash or something, making internet access unavailable. Unplug and plug the power back does fix the problem, and the unit works flawless most of the time.Overall, definitely recommended."
5,Very easy to setup and it works out of the box,"It literally takes me minutes to setup my wireless while the cable guys were here setting up my coax cable internet connection. I decided to run WEP 128bits anyway and it worked. I am streaming internet radio to my laptop and my Desktop PC. Throughout my house, I get at least 80% signal and link strength. I do have both netgear usb and pc cards with the netgear wireless router. I recommend this."
5,Great Product. Low Price,"I'm new in wireless networking. Just got this router today, hooked it up and was online in seconds. Works perfect with my Motorola Surfboard cable modem. Took a little more time to set up wireless access, but now everything is up and running smoothly."
1,Bad performance bad service,"Bought this ... two weeks ago, it is NOT compatible with my Centrino laptop at all. ... I then bought another router D link DI-614+, works perfect with Centrino, 2 times faster than Netgear (tested through MSN.com)."
4,"Great, simple, not external antenna option","This router is great. Easy to install and use. Works very well. I am using it with an all Macintosh (OS 9 and X) home network and works without a glitch.I am giving it 4 starts because I would like to have the option to add an external antenna to be able to get a better range.Besides that, it's great!"
1,"good product, NO rebate.","Had this product for about eight months now. Although the wireless range could be a bit better, it has worked fine..."
2,Good - but not good enough,"I bought this prodcut with the hopes of sitting in my dining room or living room and working from there...however, the range just did not allow for it. It was easy to set up, just like my hard wired router, but I could not believe how slow it was and how weak the signal seemed to be.I am going to try another brand, but unfortunately I believe all these wireless networking devices are going to have problems with my house, my 2.4ghz phone and my need for spped."
1,Not worth the low price,"Coming from a standard router (Netgear RT314) I thought the best way to do wi-fi was with a combo unit so I bought the MR814v2. Hooked it up using the same settings as the RT314 (on Comcast cable.) The wired ports were very sluggish, it took 1/2 to 1 second to load a page. Whereas with my RT314 they load instatntly. So I'm returning this and getting a stand-alone access point (I'll stick with my rock-sold RT314 thank you.)"
1,"Incompatible with Windows Messenger 4.7, lousy support",Easy to set-up and has broadcasts for a wide range. But incompatible with the video conferencing features of the latest Windows Messenger -- even after upgrading the firmware to a new version the supposedly supports UPnP. I have literally spent over a month trying to converse through email (apparently the only way to interact) with their support staff. Responses are extremely slow. Get a different person every time which results in going in circles revisiting prior solutions that have been tried and failed.
1,not as described,"The router described on Amazon's page and in the downloadable user's manual offered as part of that description is not the router you will get. All information describes Netgear's original model the MR814. You will get the MR814 v2 which has no stand, is half the size, has a 2db antenna rather than the original 5db (and it is not removable like the original) etc. The MR814 v2 is an inferior, cost cutting product. Which probably accounts for the wide range of ratings you see in the 400 customer comments. Except for those that didn't get their rebates which means they paid even more for an inferior product. Read those comments carefully before you decide to buy on price alone.And Amazon - how about updating this page with current information."
2,Cheap and easy on the eyes -- but totally unreliable,"I've been using one of these for the past year or so, and really need to warn people away from them.It's nice and cheap, and it looks great and has a great user interface through its web UI -- but it has a serious bug. Heavy internet use will cause it to crash -- it won't even respond to pings from the LAN. To fix this requires a manual power cycle.This really bit me badly last weekend, when I was on the road and needed to log into my home machine via ssh -- the MR814 had crashed and the internet connection was down as a result.It's a real shame, as in most other respects, it's a perfectly good product. But the reliability problems are just too serious."
4,In nonstop use for years,"I've had this router for a couple of years now, maybe three. I used it with DSL and then I moved, and now it's hooked up to a cable modem. In all that time I've had an xbox wirelessly attached nearly non stop for over 2 years. I have had two computers connected by wire and often 2 laptops wirelessly. All of this in a pretty large 2 story house. I've rarely had to power off or reset this router and every device I use can find it without problem.All in All, for the money I spent on this, I can't complain at all. It works, it doesn't fail, what more can you ask for in a wireless router."
2,Range Claims exagerated,"I got everything to work right out of the box pretty quickly and easily. Have three computers running through it, one using a standard rj45 cable, which works quite well. The other is using the MA311 PCI wireless card, and a Dell laptop using MA401. At a distance of 80 to 90 feet through the house the MA311 gets a 30% signal at best, and the MA401 gets 0% and will not connect to router. Tech support stepped me though a few things. But ended up telling me it's too far away from the base station, and that it was not really designed to function in a 2-Story Environment. I have limited experience with this type of networking but it seems that with a claim of 500 feet max range, an 80 foot distance should be working much better."
2,Outdated,My problem with this otherwise good deal was its propensity to lay down when I started opening a lot of connections (e.g. p2p).It also had a problem with yahoo!mail account. Don't ask me how this is possible. The router should be transparent at that level but I can tell you : with the Netgear there was a problem with connection getting reset to certain yahoo servers and the problem went away with a Linksys and direct connections.
1,Terrible!,"This router worked great for a month. I don't know if it was chaging ISP's or what, but now my 3 month ""complimentary"" support has expired and I have a router that doesn't work. I can use pay support to get an RMA or start ALL over with net support. This has been a total waste of my time and money. Do yourself a favor and buy something different!"
5,Dependable product,"I bought this because of the endless problems with my Linksys BEFW11P1 (which seems to be discontinued - rightly so). This one worked right out of the box - and never stopped working.The only problem I had was getting my DSL provider to assign it an IP address, because the Linksys has no way of releasing it, only renewing. But the Netgear is great - it allows you to release the IP address and it even let me mimick the MAC address from the Linksys router temporarily, enough to convince my ISP's DHCP server to release the IP address and bind it to the new box's MAC address. Also the signal seems much better than the Linksys's."
3,"Workable, but not perfect","I got another Linksys wireless router in the same environment. The signal strength and coverage of Netgear is as good as linksys, but the connection quality is much worse. I got only 75% transmission speed from Netgear, and sometimes the speed will drop and rise again after 1 or 2 seconds. Its wireless performance is not as good as its industorial design. This router indeed has space to improve in its wireless connection quality."
4,New to a wireless world......,"I was new to the wireless world, when i first looked into a wireless router. This router was incredibly easy to set up, especially as I am still pretty new to computers. After setting up though, i would find that intermittently i would lose the connection to my laptop. My laptop, as well as others would read a signal from the router, but the internet would be down. I have now found that whenever this does occur, to reset the router by unplugging power from the router, and then replugging it back. So far this has always resolved the problem, a little annoying, but again problem resolved.Overall though, I am happy with this router, and i think at this price, you can't beat it."
4,good router,easy to install with XP. very very secure software once you set the 128bit encryption and WEP.I also bought the PCMCIA MA401 that now is fully XP compatible.excellent. did not lose the connection once in 10 hours around the house
1,BAD Macintosh Support,"I bought this to connect Macs at home and had read that is was particularly easy to do with this router. The dhcp server was not assigning an IP address so I called tech support. First, they did try to help, but it didn't work. Since I had a Mac I would have to pay for their premium support, Windows users do not. No where on their website does it say that Mac support is extra. I ended up returning the product."
1,Mac users steer clear,"Now I know why the price of this router keeps getting cheaper and cheaper.I bought this to replace my aging Linksys router, which was starting to require a reboot almost daily. In short, this Netgear router does not play nice with the Airport Extreme card in my Apple Powerbook.Sure I can connect to the Wi-Fi router. And sure it has great range (which was important to me). But transfer speeds of 3 kbs just don't cut it (doesn't matter how close I am to the router). Signal is nice and strong, but transfer sucks (WEP on or off).Hooking up to the router with a wired connection works just fine.. but that kind of defeats the whole purpose of wireless, doesn't it?Oh yeah, and even though it says ""Mac OS compatible"", it doesn't pass Appletalk traffic. So be prepared to enter the IP address of your printer and whatever net devices you need to connect to.Mac users would be wise to avoid this one."
3,"Great price, won't last long","It was great for about 1 year, after this time it starts lock-ups. I need to reset it every day, looks like heat related problem"
1,Need to power off and on,"The installation of product is easy, but the technical support is HORRIBLE. The level 1 support specaialist was not able to figure out that the firmware has to be upgraded and I wasted 4 hours of my time, after that it worked fine for 3 days and then I started to loose the internet connection, powered off the router and rebooted the computer,it started to work fine, but I lost the connection after 10 minutes, it started to happen every time I switched on the PC, it works fine for 10 minutes and again it drops the connection. In order for me to verify that it was the router, I disconnected the router and used my old wired router, I did not have the disconnect issue. After this I installed Netgear, I am having the same issues, I talked to support and they told me to ship it back to the Vendor. My recommendation is not to buy this product from my experience."
1,"Horrible router, constant signal drops","I foolishly purchased this router a year ago when it was on sale with a mail in rebate. To this day I regret the decision.Basically, the device is a piece of junk. The wireless signal strength is terrible and won't work past 2 rooms. Furthermore, the router will shut down its wireless component every 1.5 days so that you have to manually reboot the thing to get it working again. No amount of upgrading the firmware helped. Netgear support was completely useless.If you are looking for a wireless router, buy the Linksys WRT54G/GS and then go to www.sveasoft.com to install their custom firmware. You will have a $50 router with enough functions built-in (QoS, custom firewall, etc.) to rival business class products five times its cost."
2,Doesn't Work!,"I've had this ""wireless"" router for years, but not ONE time did the ""wireless"" ever work. I don't recommend this product. I did not buy this router on Amazon."
3,It is a gamble.,I bought the MR814v2 several days ago and have had only frustration after the first day. At first I thought it was the result of updating to the latest firmware so a downgraded to the old revision. But the problems persisted. Then I started reading the reviews.The MR814 was intended to replace a Siemens SpeedStream 2604 that has worked flawlessly for me for 3 years. The 2604 was another device that fared poorly in user reviews. My point? NetGear's (and Siemens) quality control appears to be poor. Some people will get the winners and some the lemons. The unfortunate thing about all these review sites is that they have no legitimate way to give % results. What % of the MR814s are junk from the start? If I knew the answer to that I would know whether to return my unit or exchange it for another.
5,GREAT product - VERY simple to set up,"This product is my first venture into home networking, and I was expecting it to be a pain to set up. I couldn't have been more wrong. It literally took me less than 10 minutes to set up the router, and my laptop (with a built-in wireless card) recognized the network instantly and configured itself. It works well all over my house, and the speed of my internet access is as good on the laptop as the desktop. Setting up security is a little complex, but if you read a couple of good articles on how to set it up, you shouldn't have any problems. Overall, a very nice product at an unreal price of sub-$10 after rebates. Highly recommended!"
3,Mixed feelings.,"You can't beat this for the price. It works. Setup was not quite so easy. I spent a few hours rebooting the router and my computer, and when it finally did work I couldn't really tell you exactly what I did to get it to work. It's also not as fast, obviously, as what you can get.However, now that I have it set up, I haven't regretted it for the price. I don't use wireless all that much, and my desktop that I have directly plugged into it has not had any problems with it. I would recommend it for a cheap solution."
2,Do NOT buy this if you need to schedule events!,"This router's clock hardware loses about an hour a day, so if you need to use the scheduling function (like limiting your kid's internet access at night) you'll constantly have to manually update the time setting. Netgear tech support lied to me and said I'm the only one to experience this, but there are entire online forums dedicated to the problem:http://www.broadbandreports.com/forum/remark,9352534~mode=flat?hilite=MR814v2Another bug: Blocking sites by keyword doesn't work correctly. I tried blocking hotmail by schedule, and it just blocked it continually...never unblocked it until I did it manually.I even exchanged mine for a new replacement, and the replacement did the same thing.All the rest of the functions seemed to work okay."
5,Excellent product,"I purchased the unit some months ago, so it is much less in cost now but let me tell you. It a great deal and delivers speeds as if your computer was connected directly to the router. A great buy if your thinking of going wireless."
2,Not so hot,Came home and hooked it up with my Earthlink DSL. Didn't work. Checked the message boards around the internet and found out that it dosen't work with XP. They were right. Used my Windows 2000 laptop and it went through without a hitch. Now here is the problem. I went across my apartment (1 bedroom) and the signal is poor..... Don't buy if you have walls in your house.
1,Poor documentation and poor support make for bad combination,"I made the mistake of purchasing this router. File sharing, internet access and the wireless connectivity work fine but I use my home network for online games. I tried to configure my new router to allow me to act as a server for several different games. The online documentation is very sparse, as is the KB on the Netgear site. I sent a question to their support staff, asking for expanded documentation on port-forwarding. After getting a canned e-mail response asking for my serial number (which I had already provided), I was told that this question ""fell outside of the scope of support"", and I would have to pay $28.95 (or $1.95/min) for ""Premium Support"". This is almost 30% of the price of the router itself for a single support incident. It's too bad that 1 star is as low a rating as you can make. I will never buy another Netgear product again."
1,version specific,"I own three of these things.. one V1, two V2s..What ever you do, dont own a V1.. its not readyfor primtime.. there is a reason after all why theycreated a V2.Techsupport is pathetic.. Hope you never have tocall them.. I have been trying to get the V1 to emaillogfiles ever since we have purchased it.. if you geta V1, save the box and return it..Setup was easy, the web interface is not difficult.. justhope you dont have issues.. they will not get resolvedtalking to the techsupport folks.."
1,Never buying another Netgear product,"Between the MR314 and MR8114, I've had to get my Netgear routers replaced 4 times. This most recent time the router they sent me was junk right out of the box. It will work for a couple hours then just quit. I have to unplug it for a while, then plug it back in and it will work for a little bit again. On my previous router, it worked well for 6 months or so, but then the internet port just quit working.I'm sick of having to spend 45 minutes to an hour on the phone with someone that hardly speaks english just to get an RMA number to get the thing replaced. I'm just giving up on Netgear and getting a Linksys."
2,"severe security flaw when using as wireless AP (V2, 5.3fw)","I use this router as wireless access pointbut when I tried to configure, I got stuck on ""Smart Wizrad"", and I don't have to login at allafter I referred the manual, found I can bypass the stupid wizard, but I still can jump in without loginthis is a severe security issue!!!other than that, it works OK as access point, no disconnect with pdaswarning: if you use this router as AP, YOU MUST disable SSID broadcast and enable MAC filtering at least"
5,"simple, good features, perfect for home use","I have used the router for several months now and I haven't had a problem with it. It's simple to set up, fairly powerful, and for the price it's great. I have no problem with the range, I sat my laptop at the other end of my apartment, and left it pinging the router for about 20 minutes, through a few walls, and the packet loss was about 1.2%, more than acceptable. I'm not sure why other people are seeing so many problems; maybe they need to make sure the position the aerial properly?"
3,Router will drop connection/no firmware updates,"It is true what others have noticed about this router. Every once in a while you will have to power it down to regain connection to your wireless PC. I have continually checked Netgear's website for firmware updates for this router and there have been none.When it is working and can maintain a connection it seems to be a nice product, but for a telecommuter like me, it is annoying to have to power cycle the router every couple of hours to regain my VPN connection.I guess you get what you pay for though."
2,Got what I paid for,"It is cheap and it has worked for me for me for 10 months now. after about 6 month, started to have some problem with the wireless network, for every 5-10 minutes, it pauses for 10-30 seconds. If you are surfing the web you are not going to feel it, but I used to play music online, and it really sucks to have this problem. The wired connection with is router works just fine. anyway, it is just what you paid for."
1,Not suitable for cross platform environments,"Even though this router is supposedly suitable for PC and Macs both. Don't waste your money. It had to be constantly reset. Dropped connections repeatedly. The tech support line has waits that exceed anything I have ever experienced on any product. Information from them was not helpful to cross platform. They know PCs and nothing else.Get the Linksys wireless for dependable service and good tech support, but you probably won't need the techsupport. Linksys is plug and play. No hassle."
5,Great router!,"MR814v3Especially easy setup. All I had to do was plug it into the modem and the computer into it, and it worked flawlessly (besides the fact that I had to fix and ethernet setting on my computer that I had messed with before. Wireless also works great, and has many advanced options."
2,Stopped working before I even received my rebate!,"I purchased this router in September 04. It never achieved the range Netgear advertises. Friends suspected this was due to my old home being constructed ""differently"" from homes now. Perhaps this is the case. But that doesn't explain why by early November (two months from the date of purchase), the router was consistently dropping the signal. Overall signal strength became unreliable. It would rise and fall from ""very good"" to ""low"" in a matter of minutes, despite the fact that the computer, router, and I (and even my cat) hadn't moved an inch.All in all, I wasn't impressed. I've switched to Linksys's comparable router, which has a strong signal in every room of my home. Fingers crossed I have no problems down the road with this one."
1,"Maybe it's just me, but this thing is terrible...","I was not happy with the performance of a D-Link WiFi router so I thought I'd try the better rated Netgear MR814v2. This was worse than the D-Link.Where the D-Link would have only a momentary drop in the wireless link, this router completely stops passing data on a regular basis. I have to unplug (reboot) the router, release & renew the IP configuration and restart. I tried to call Netgear tech support for 2 days but never reached a person. I was either placed in ""dead air"" or put on hold and then disconnected after about 30 minutes of waiting. A bad product and bad support.I'll probably go back to the D-Link because that model would at least continue working after a brief drop. That's better than a complete freeze.It's frustrating to see so many positive reviews only to get a product that's unusable."
5,So far so GOOD,"For the price this NETGEAR WIRLESS router can not be beat,buy now before the rebate expires!Brand name company ,quality product.Very easy install and lots of features for those who like to tweak,"
1,"Worst Wireless Router, I had ever seen.","Hi,I brought this router from Amazon.com on 11/12/2004. I am a Software Engineer and have good amount of knowledge on Networking. Still struggling to make it up.I called up Netgear Technical support four times and finally they agreed to exchange the product with a proper one.I got this product without evaluating the technical feedbacks. I looked the final price $ 7.44 which was looking very nice. But now I have to ship the product to Netgear by paying $ 7.xx to UPS.I would not suggest this product to anyone.Try paying little higher for a better product. There are so many versions of Netgear and other wireless router available on Amazon.com. You can try one of those. Please do not fall fray for money.Thanks,Laxmi"
1,"Looks COOL, but that's about it",a) router is VERY noisy(if you are planning to put this router in the same room that you sleep - low pitched noise will drive you crazy)b) poor range(I placed router on the second floor - first floor doesn't have a connection. Now the question is WHY did I want the wireless router??? ahh didn't want to bother with wires... what a bummer).c) if you have 2.4 phone - connection drops immediately and doesn't get restored until you turn off your phone ...d) and the last little thing - poor admin interface:- little middle window with configuration parameters- admin password cannot be longer than 12 characters ???...And all of this after 15 min using this device....
2,bad range,"I've used a few of these with friends and determinedthe range is poor, I can't even get from one sideof the house to the other...I swapped inSMC units, and they were fine.I suspect the radio is lower power than others.The netgear G unit does much better in terms of rangeeven running at B speeds."
1,"produce works fine, but the worst on issuing rebate","The reason why I give it 1 star is mainly because of Netgearstupid rebate policy, they will try to find some ridiculous reasonto deny your rebate. In my case, they denied my rebate becauseI used my PO as the address (while other companies are fine with sending rebate to a PO box!).The product works fine, but don't fall for the rebate crap!It will not be cheap if you are not going to get your rebate."
2,Disappointed,"Didn't work from the start. Was on hold for 60 minutes for tech support. Tech was friendly, recognized the unit was defective, and authorized return (I paid for return shipping.) Can't comment on performance, as I haven't had a chance to assess, but out-of-box experience was definitely disappointing."
2,Can't deal with the timeout issue,"With my ssh connections into my home system and chess club connections, I'm timed out after some period of time around 5 minutes. I did not have this issue when my pc was connected directly to the highspeed cable bridge. I liked netgear products in the past but this issue is a little more than annoying."
2,bad experience - had to return,"the setup was quick and easy, first 2 days it worked great then it started to get disrupted and within a week i was unable to use it for more than 30min or so. Maybe it used to get heated, maybe my piece in particular was bad.... whatever it was - i was disappointed and had to return."
1,Mac users beware,"For all you mac users out there, this is not for you. I have an iBook and G5 and neither could connect well. Web pages loaded at a painstaking pace while file sharing is even worse. I am generally pretty easy on wireless products because wireless itself is still relatively new, but this is unacceptable, completely. Buy an Airport.One Final thought, and one that didn't occur to me until after I bought it: This costs 16 dollars, and you truly get what you pay for."
5,Easier than all the ho's in college!,"If you're looking for a good time without having to labor with ethernet cable, this router's for you. OK, its not 802.11g but still blazing fast for Internet surfing and residential LAN workloads. Hook it up, and configure online per the work instructions. Its easy, and no drivers are required. Its also very reliable as I've yet to experience a loss of signal during any session.For all you numbnuts out there, make sure you have a USB wireless adapter, PCI or Wi-Fi network card, or Apple Airport for the client computers. Duhhhhh!!!!"
1,Dont buy this even if you get it for free!!,"Got this router 2 months back. Was very happy to see the design of the router and mis-understood that it will even perform to the same level. First time I insert the configuration CD into my laptop, BOOM!! my wireless network went for a toss!!! Thankfully, my laptop has 'restore' functionality which allowed me to restore the settings prior to the netgear installation. I'm saved.It worked so-so for about a month. After that, everytime i want to connect to the net, I have to shutdown my laptop for atleast 10 minutes and then start it again. After repeating this for 3-4 times, 'it might connect'!! Feels pathetic. I would prefer a dial-up connection over this router.I'm giving one star, since i'm able to connect to the internet atleast few times a day!!"
1,Won't maintain an ssh connection,"While easy to set up, and otherwise works fine, as a router it leaves something to be desired. I cannot maintain a persistent connection either in or out via this router. If I login to any of my usual working computers using ssh, the connection is dropped and timed out after a few minutes, meaning I have to login again on another shell. This is not an intermittent problem, as when one connection dies, I can immediately open another shell and ping the device or log in again - it just drops the connection.I also plugged my old non-wifi SMC Barricade back in and had none of these problems, so I know it isn't me.I tried to email customer service and got no reply. I called customer service and got a fellow who didn't know what ssh is, and whose only solution was to reload the driver from the (very slow) website.So I'm returning this device and getting something else. Probably a wifi SMC Barricade."
1,DO NOT BUY!!!! CONNECTION DROPS OFTEN! NO SUPPORT!!!,"I have experienced the same problem as many others have done. When you first connect it, it works for a while but then the connection drops. I think this product is defective. Read the other comments here. Technical supports do not help at all. They have not accept thised to repair. 90 day warrant is WORTHLESS. Why you think Amazon is selling this for just $6 after rebate. In my opinion, this doesn't even worth $6. DO NOT BUY!!!!!"
1,The product has fatal flaw,"My experiences echos those in the review forum - when it works it's great, but the product has a fatal flaw that's pain in the neck. It will drop the connection after 1-2 hours. Need to disconnect the power and leave it alone for at least 5 minutes. Even that does not gurantee the problem to be resolved. Some comments in the forum attribute it to heat. I haven't called Netgear support yet. The experiences from others in the Forum is not great."
3,Great for Windows....bad for Mac.,"I bought this router because it was cheap and did everything I wanted it to do. I used it to connect my Windows XP desktop to my cable modem via ethernet cable and allow my Windows XP laptop to connect wirelessly. This worked great! No problems at all. Plenty of signal, no hassle connections, administration interface is fine.However, I recently got a new 15"" Apple Powerbook for work, which includes an Airport Extreme card (802.11g). I've had nothing but troubles getting the router to give an IP address to the Powerbook. It'll do it if I physically cycle the power on the router or reset it via the administration interface, but no options I've found will let it do this automatically. Major hassle.I've updated the firmware on both my router and my laptop...no change.So, I recommend this router if you think you'll only be using Windows machines."
1,very poor distance,"The router works well ""if"" you are within 10 feet of the router. If not it will NOT work as promised. Why would anyone want wireless on a notebook with such poor performance?"
2,make sure u save the reciet,"ok i hooked this up two months before i got dsl to wirelessly game and it worked fine, then i got dsl and it was too also good although one thing i didnt suspect was that it was slowing down my connection...i leaned this laterone day my sister tried to send a lenghthy email and everytime she sent it it was ""interupted"" i thought it had to do with my eamil settings i tried everything and didnt work finnaly i tried unhooking it and hooking my verison dsl line directly into my computer and email and everything, my speed was even dramatically improved.I tried updating the firmware and even turned off the firewall yet this problem continued to persist. I am very dissapointed with this product and am kicking myself for not keping the reciet."
1,$40 rebate requires you buy a computer too!,"""If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is false!""Don't expect to get this product for $19.99. If you buy this product alone, you are only eligible for (one) $20 rebate from Netgear. Do the homework, view both of Amazon's ""rebates."" They show the same rebate twice! I search online and found a $40 rebate, but you had to buy the MR814 and a computer. Good luck!"
4,Only for pros,"This is a great product at a fantastic price (with rebate). Yet, if you have even the simplest need for support you will lose your savings in a hurry if you call tech support ($2/min!). I had a simple question (does the wireless router support Appletalk) which was incorrectly answered (it doesn't) for $8."
5,Great Way To Get Wireless!,"This is a great product. Within an hour I had two desktops, two laptops, and an xbox all hooked up.Installation could not have been easier. Just a couple tweaks via the browser-based router utility.Product is nice because it offers wired/wireless connections. XBox and desktops use wired and laptops are wireless via the MR804 PC card.Performance is very good. DSL connection is in second story bedroom, and wireless works fine all the way down in the basement.5 stars!"
3,Good if you're a home user,"I was up and running right away, but soon found some problems with the router.1. Does not support 802.1x authentication. Make sure this is disabled.2. Does not support multiple VPN sessions from same client whether wired or wireless. I need to VPN to 2 separate networks simultaneously from the same machine. When I connect to the second network, the router is unable to see the first network.This is a easy to use, effective router as long as you're not doing anything too fancy. For me, it's routing capabilities are not as good as my Linux router on a floppy."
1,Netgear MR814 802.11b refurbished wireless router,"This refurbished product only worked for about 1-2 hours after first set up. I then had to turn it off for 12-18 hours to get it to work again. I also learned Netgear only offers e-mail support for refurbished products as they have NO SERIAL NUMBER to register online, via mail, or telephone. There is no recourse for return of the item except to the person from whom it was purchased."
1,Worst Router Every,The first router I received worked for about 2hrs until it crapped out. Stopped assigning IP address and could even log into it. Sent it back and received a new one. It works but every once in a while the wireless functionality stops working. I have to unplug it and wait a couple minutes till I can connect again. Only buy if you want a headache.
1,Not working with SBC Yahoo DSL,"If you are using SBC Yahoo DSL, don't buy this router. It gave me a very very slow connection, a lot of time no connection at all. And their support don't know what wrong, just gave me some useless answers. The setup took some time and work too.I changed to a Linksys, done everything within 1 minute, and it works very well."
2,It didnt work.,"Well,The router continuously dropped signal from the cable modem.I set up everything for hours according to the instructions andthe router would work sporadically, maybe half the time. I'd clickon a website and be unable to connect to it. After a minute, itwould work. The modem was working as I've been using that now.The company has a great website with a lot of resources available."
5,Extremely solid product,"I had this Netgear Wireless-B router for a while and I can say it is quite a solid product. It does its job quite well without being annoying or obtrusive. The web based configuration utility is very handy and feature complete. If you do get one of these, be sure to periodically check for firmware updates from Netgear. Also be aware of Wireless-G technology which is newer and faster."
1,poor coverage.,This router seems to have a range of about 12 feet. Seriously. I recommend the similar SMC wireless router.
4,Cute but a little difficult for little fingers.,"My daughter received this and absolutely loves it. The only thing I would warn parents is that it is very difficult to open the top cover where the 3 little pets are stored. She can not do it on her own, she is six and it is not even easy for me. She also got the teeniest tinest barnyard one which slides open rather than latches. I would recommend this one since it is similar in a lot of other ways and much easier to work. Overall it is very cute, not much educational value but it will keep them busy."
1,I thought I was getting the actual book,"I'm sure the review is lovely, I just thought I was getting the actual book. It was listed right there with the other ""Great Gatsby"" books."
4,Gatsby will hit you when you are least expecting,"deep and insightful, full of intellegent analogies and representations. i read Gatsby the begining of my junior year in high school and-didnt really like it. i wrote papers on it, and dissected the ...poor novel. now-months later-it finally hits me: Gatsby is a book to be read and enjoyed! not dissected and torn appart. all the quotes and passages that i liked so much came rushing back to me... i understood what fitz may have been writing about! i though and though and thought about Gatsby and realized that i did not just Like the book-i [really] LOVED IT!"
2,More Used Than Advertised,"This item came from one of Amazon's third party vendors. That vendor claimed the book was in Good condition. Obviously there is a broad definition of the word Good. This book should have been rated fair to poor. At least it had all the pages, but there is writing in the book, highlighting, stained pages (water spill?) and other detractors. On the back cover it even said Very Good, I only hope they meant the story and not the condition.So beware of purchasing used books from some of these vendors, they use condition descriptions very loosly."
1,"One of the worst of the so called ""classics""","This book should be pulled from high school curriculum as it really has no redeeming value. Basically if the Fitzgerald name was not associated with it, it would be out of print today.Who really wants to read about a bunch of rich whiners from the Jazz era who smoke and drink too much, have extramarital affairs which result in murder all while using every large word in Websters dictionary to add color to a very unsuccessful writers attempt at literature.Please note that Mr. Fitzgerald's fame was very short lived.Is this really the content we want our young people to become motivated by?Teachers like to use it because curriculum is easy to find and they don't have to really do any real work in creating lesson plans."
2,Falls Flat,"I don't know if its just me, but I did not like this book too much. It feels empty- missing something almost. Perhaps it is Nick. He seems to be without a personality. He's just there. The story might as well be told in third person for crying out loud. I like protagonists with personality. Also, the author is quite sexist and racist and that is unacceptable.I did give it two stars becuase to the author's credit, it was a tidy little book and not a sprawing mess. But then, it was too tidy and neat. After finishing it, I thought, ""so what?"" It did not particularly dazzle me and enlighten me, and I was not entertained. It is, all in all, a hollow book."
4,E'gads Gatsby,"Well written and researched book on the Great Gatsby by an insightful and thoughtful scholar. I found it interesting to see her take on a major, popular, male American author during an intriguing time of change in American society. For the Gatsby afficcionando, the Fitzgerald student, as well as the individual interested in American social thought post WWI, will find this study, particularly since it is done from a British viewpoint, a valuable perspective. Many insightful footnotes and asides. References are made to Penguin's edition of the Great Gatsby but it is not necessary to have this edition. For the general reader who wishes more understanding about this tremendous novel I suggest Kathleen Parkinson's fine study an important companion."
5,very happy with book,I was very pleased to receive the merchandise and arrived promptly on time for my daughter to start class after her xmas vacations.
3,"Song from ""Martian Child"" my daughter wanted","It's exactly what my daughter wanted after watching her ""Martian Child"" DVD for the umpteenth time since there is no movie soundtrack recording available for that movie. After watching the ceremonial dance scene again, I see why she wanted her own copy so that she can listen and memorize the words."
5,This Ghastly Movie.....!!!!!!!!!,"This ghastly movie is pretty heavy going. But I still like it. It is a real Gothic classic. Great exteriorsof a Gothic castle. I noticed Franco finds great locations, and these European ""chateaus"". See ""Virgin Among the Living Dead"" and ""Eugenie de Sade"".Moreover, who or what is this ""Morpho""???? Who is ""Morpho""???????? He seems to be a conglomeration of all the classic monsters: Frankenstein, The Mummy, vampires (and perhaps Dracula), and zombies. And for being blind and lobotomized he can get around pretty well.At the very end there seem to be some typical Franco ambiguities, and jump cutting. Orlof's beloved daughter Melissa who has been kept in a glass case for the entire movie,which lends speculation as to what condition she is in to begin with, expires for vague reasons."
2,The Awful Dr. Orloff (DVD),"This movie reminds me some what of Lugosi's ""Human Monster"", but it really doesn't measure up. Somewhat atmospheric, but there really isn't much entertainment value here. If you find dubbed audio tracks distracting, then forget this one."
2,Relatively Useless,"IMHO, this book left much to be desired as it's examples rely exclusively on the fictious website contained on the accompanying CD. It does not go into any details of FrontPage 2000, merely glosses over the ""high"" points in it's 275 pages. While it may be beneficial to some users, I cannot recommend this publication to anybody who wants to construct a serious website.I'm off to order another title concerning FrontPage 2000, which I hope will be much more beneficial than this ""Step by Step"" publication."
4,You will be designing webs in two days.....,"Step by Step is exactly the correct title. This book is great for the person who buys software and wants to start using it right away without having to read a 4000 page novel. I was able to cover 6 lessons in two days (approximately 10 hours). To move this quickly, you should have a good foundation of Windows. Once you have completed all 10 lessons, then you can move on to the advanced books. This book covers planning, hyperlinks, adding style, tables, sound, images and video, creating forms, using frames and finally publishing and managing the web after it is published. Excellent."
4,"Excellent for beginners, but 2 superficial","This book is probably the best book you can buy if are new to web authorng and FP. I learned everything in this book in 4 days, and I now feel I need a more comprehensive book in order to use advance features such as script editor and database integration. If you are a beginner BUY IT NOW, but remember you will soon need another book in order to master FP techniques."
2,Covers many advanced features while neglecting a few basics.,"I have worked through most of this book, and while the lessons are helpful, where are the instructions for creating buttons? It never tells you how you can use graphics, etc. from the web. I discovered ""Image Composer"" (which apparently is a graphics program included with FrontPage 2000) completely by accident. The book never even mentions that it exists. I am now in the process of looking for a book that includes instructions on ""Image Composer."" It looks like one can use it to work with graphics, and buttons, etc. in FrontPage 2000."
5,Truly Ackoff's Best,"Recreating the Corporation is Ackoff's best work on utilizing the use of systems thinking to understand how to make not only pieces of companies better, but how optimizing the entire company can lead to dramatic improvements. Those who know Ackoff's work will appreciate his freshening of material contained elsewhere and the addition of new concepts to make the framework wholistic."
1,didnt like it,"i cant get this stuff out of my hair.... i washed my hair 4 times and then went to the salon, the girl there washed it 3 times and still my roots are stuck together..... not to mention my curls were rock hard :("
5,NONcrunchy help for my weak curls,"PROS: My curls are very weak (barely curly hair.) Usually, curl products either emphasize a curl but leave my hair stiff and crunchy, or they are too glossy/moisturizing and weigh my curls down. This is what I've been searching for. It's my holy grail hair product. I get definition and a bit of smoothing effect, while making my curls more ""curly."" It even makes my fine hair appear more thick. Smell is fine.CONS: Not the cheapest in the world, but there are much more expensive products too. I could see how this would weigh someone's hair down if they didn't use it sparingly.APPLICATION TIPS: I was using ""Spray it Curly"" by itself. I now use the Spray it Curly sprayed into my hand to scrunch my ends with. I then take this and put a small amount at a time into my hands and work some into my root area (and some mid-shaft too). I could see using this a bit on my ends too.PURCHASING TIPS: I get this at a better price through amazon."
5,great product,Great for curly hair or even hair u are going to curl! it is a very good product for cheap
1,MARY,"THE FLOWERS DO NOT GET AS OPENED AS THEY LOOK ON THE PICTURE, AND THE TEA DOES NOT TASTE THAT WELL, VERY DISSAPOINTING!!!!!!!"
4,Great mp3 player / delaget hard drive,The zen micro is a great high capacity mp3 player.But it has a delicate hard drive. I have had it for 6 montes and then it started skipping and then started fogetting songs and then it just stopped and because i dont have the ricite the warenty is invalled
4,Creative Sound quality with some HFE problems,"I have used the Zen Micro (6GB) for about 4-5 months now and I am satisfied with the product. There is a lot of storage space to carry all the songs and most importantly the sound quality is excellent. Sound quality has as much to do with the earphones as with the player itself and I am more than satisfied with both. The interface on the player is easy to use and directory structure, etc. is clear. The interface (button) sensitivity is easily adjustable which helps, especially while travelling.On the negative side, the human factor engineering could use some development. I have consistantly found it difficult to access the storage (Data as opposed to music) difficult to access and retrive data from. However, the software controls for loading music on the player is simple and easy to use.All in all, given the excellent sound quality I declare myself a satisfied customer and I may consider another Creative product in the future."
4,Excellent player,"This is an excellent player for those of you who dont like to use itunes. The hard drive went out on my first player, so i had to get a replacement, but the replacement works fine. The sound quality is better than my old ipod mini, the battery lasts longer than my ipod mini, and it plays wma. Also it works great with windows media player and my yahoo subscription, which is a big plus for me."
1,customer support?,"This is a company with offices and manufacturing facilities on several continents, with probably thousands of employees, and the only way to get customer service by phone is Mon-Fri 9-6 Central Time, closed on holidays? This might be a fine product, but I'll never know because I'm sending it back without ever getting to try it. We have two computers, one with Windows 98SE, the other with XP, and neither one can load the software successfully and recognize that the player is plugged in, and I have to wait 48 hrs. for any customer service? That's just too lame for me."
1,Micro HDD NO!,"Purchased this for my daughter to replace her iAudio U2 (EXCELLENT not enough storage) this thing stopped working one month after Christmas (earphone jack issue); repaired. Stopped excepting new music two (2) months after repair. Rebuilding the library caused it to erase all music placed on the device the previous day. Had to place music on it every day and try to keep it on all day. finally, stopped altogether... replaced it with iAudio 6, which did somewhat the same. Conclusion the micro HDD is not ready for prime time. I am shell shocked with micro HDD and will never purchase another EVER, flash for small players. Finally replaced with iAudio D2 a FLASH player."
2,Serious Problems.,I got this player from Best Buy and thought that I had gotten a good deal. The battery life is very misleading. A charge overnight is supposed to give you 12 hours of battery life. With normal menu usage and about 600 songs the battery life dropped to maybe 2 hours.For the first two and a half months the player was fine and there was no trouble. Now my player freezes up within minutes of turning it on. The tech support from Creative is practivally non existent. I will have to send it in for repairs and hopefully have a better time. Thank God I bought the service plan from Best Buy.
2,I bought 2!!,"Gahhh what was I thinking? I bought one for my daughter and one for myself! I didn't buy the warantee and now I have two dead players. Mine won't boot up and my dughter's has a faulty earphone socket. Via e mail I have been communicating and trying ""fixes"" since the 3 of March. Finally today I get an RMA!! We'll see how much it costs and how long it takes to get them done. I am very dissappointed with these players. I also bought them to work with the Yahoo music service and it has been fiddly but finally I got it working and now neither player works!....see also Reviewer: Jerferd (Maine, USA) for similar review!!"
3,It's aight,"The MP3 is aight. It's harder to fuction then an IPOD. The pad is very sensitive to touch so it may take a while for you to get to what you need. The sound is straight and its aight once you get used to it. When other people ask to use it, they're so confused on what to do."
1,Great little player,"This player is great, excellent sound, easy to use. Along with the player is a instilation CD, witch gives you the latest firmware update from Creative. By using the CD I have not had the problems that the others have talked about. There is also another CD included,""Play for sure"", to use with windows media player. Which makes the music super easy to load to the player. The touch pad controls are a little sensitive, but easy to use. The ear buds have good sound, but are always falling out. I bought a set of Sennhiesier PX 100 headphones, which are light weight and have superior sound, to me a better solution. Over all I would highly recomend this player"
1,God awful piece o' c**p!!!,"Occasionally, I can get the thing to work. Crashes on a regular basis, and doesn't always feel like rebooting. It's definitely a good thing that it has a removable battery, because otherwise I'd have to wait for the battery to die before I could reboot it. I've had to reset everything multiple times, and every so often, it decides to wipe out the DMR licenses to music I've purchased. I have to say one thing....it is better than the neeon. That I couldn't get to work for more than a month before I had to replace that. Save the money you'd spend on this paperweight for something more useful, like paying to have pitbulls rip you apart."
2,Not enough memory,"6GB just wasn't enough memory for my CD collection. When you rip your CD's at 128 kbps, it only saves about 1,000 songs, not 3,000. So I returned it and bought something with 20GB. Much better! If you don't need a ton of memory, it's certainly functional. It was easy to use, small, and light. But just not enough memory for me."
4,not bad!,"This player isn't bad at all...the only downfall is 1. the pad takes a little usage to get used to and 2. it takes prettyy long to fully charge the battery. other than that, sound quality is GREAT and it looks COOL."
4,Very very good.,I have had my CZM for about 6 weeks now and I'm extremely satisfied with it. I also have Napster-ToGo and that is so cool cuase you can put almost any song you want on you CZM. I dropped my CZM from my pocket to the pavement about 3 weeks ago and I haven't had any problems besides a unavoidable sctrached screen. I love CZM!
1,A little tease,When I bought this I was so excited. It seemed to be working fine for like the first two days but then i was listening to a song and it froze. Now i have to send it to customer service and hope they will fix it
2,Allright,"if the back of the creative comes off, which it does verry easily, and the battery comes out, the harddrive will get all messed up and you will need to buy a new one, it happened to me as i was driving."
3,"liked the functions, but software is not easy to use",I really liked the fact that this had an fm tuner so I could hear the TV at the gym. One problem was the software was difficult to use and the I lost all my music on the player and had to reload it twice. I gave up after that and got an i-pod. It is much easier to use and I am an apple convert now.
2,When it worked,"The Micro has some excellent features at the right price. But it fails to work all the time. First it was the firmware, then it wouldn't connect to my PC, now the hardware has failed. I am going to buy an I Pod, despite Apple's refusal to allow other forms of mp3 downloads."
3,"It's good, but it can be better.","I love the size, and the battery life; but there are some issues with the Zen Micro.My biggest complaint is, I listen to audio books. While I can say I have no problems with the size, there tends to be a problem with the player holding my place in the book when I have to plug it in to recharge or if it's not use in a few hours (that can get annoying).Also the documentation is sparse at best, and the online guide isn't much better.This is also the second one I receive. the first had a major failure in the second week I owned it. This did not bode well for the player.So far there have not been may problems with the second one. I do get ""pops"" and for no reason the track will start over (but this could be due to the battery being low).Over all I bought the player with a $[...] off from audible, so it made buying the player a bit less painful."
4,Better than the Ipod!!!!,"I have an Ipod and The Creative Zen. I have recommended the Zen to several people that were in the market for an MP3 player. Of course with all the hype, they were going to purchase the Ipod. I showed them both players and let them listen and also how much easier it is to upload songs to the Zen. All you need is Media player, not the unnecessary iTunes! It's a breeze to set up, the sound is just as good if not better than the Ipod, and the price...well price it yourself! Ditch the Ipod and go with the Zen Micro!The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars, is the touch pad is a little to sensitive. I think they could have done a little better with that."
2,The potential's there.......but,I previously owned an iPod mini...got stolen so when I was deciding what replacement to get I went for the Creative Zen Micro. The replacable battery and the FM radio were features that I wanted which the iPod still hasn't come up with. I ordered the zen off Creative's online store...it took 8 days to arrive and it was shipping from the same city I live in! It worked wonderfully for a grand total of 2 days and now the screen has frozen and the device is useless. I rang Creative's tech support who talked me through a couple of tricks but nothing worked. It is going right back and I'm getting a refund and sticking with the iPod.
4,Tired of ipod ? try this,"Good quality sound. Holds up to 3,000 songs and still has an F.M. radio. Also this baby coms with a built in mic so u are able to record lectures and also record off the radio. I would definitly get this over an ipod mini."
1,"Run, do not walk, away from this product and company",I bought my son the Creative Zen 6GB MP3 player for a gift less than two years ago. After only normal use this player developed the same headphone jack problem that thousands of other suckers reported. Emails to Creative generated only BS responses and directed me to call them--paying yet more money--for nothing.The bottom line - don't buy a Creative product because they don't stand behind their own (shoddy) work. Spend a little more for a QUALITY product
2,mediocre product,"This is a nice gadget with all the glitz and glamour it offers, but definately has some drawbacks.1. Battery life is supposed to be ""up to 12 hours"" which doesn't even come close. 3-4 hours and it is ready for a charge up.2. When you put it on shuffle mode, it shuffles songs in same order ALL the Time, no variety. It'll bypass songs you have but never hear and play the same ones over and over again.3. SKips songs quite often unless you lock it and then if you don't like the song must unlock to change. I could go on and on... Bascially not worth the $$$$."
1,Great While It Lasted...,"I've had my Micro for over a year now, and when it worked, I loved it! However, I'm having the notorious ear phone jack issue; the sound is output in layers, and I am constantly trying to ""reposition"" my headphones to get full sound. My husband called Creative Labs for assistance, and he was told that it would cost him [...] per month for a ""customer service subscription."" After reading these reviews, it seems we'd be paying Creative Labs [...] so that they could tell us there's nothing they can (or will) do. Next brand, please..."
5,Zennifer is still running strong since 2004!,"Yes I named my player, she's a peach. What I listen to the most are audio books. I have owned the Mozaic from Creative Labs (not even close to the Zen Micro, the Apple Mini (did not like the auto shut-off feature for bedtime). I keep looking for a replacement and have decided to stick with Creative Labs for the book listening is the best! I never lose my place for more than 45 minutes (default for me). If I turn it off it remembers where I left off on the book, unless I switch to another book, then all bets are off. I should mention my need for more than one player, I drove quite a bit, had one at the treadmill, one by the bed and one in the car. Sadly, I'm down to one. I just keep buying batteries (once a year or two). THIS IS THE BEST PLAYER FOR AUDIO BOOKS EVER MADE!!! Oh, my cell phone works too, but again, no Zen Micro."
4,"Cool, but cant drag n drop","Most newer mp3 players dont require any software install, they are recognized as a storage unit, you drag and drop mp3 files to them and they play. But this does not appear to work on the zen micro. One has to install their software first in order to transfer mp3 files. Why? It makes no sense to me. And if you do enable the unit as a removable drive and drag mp3 files to it, they wont play! WUWT? Is there a law against ease-of-use?"
5,IPOD Killer,"This mp3 player is awesome. I have nothing bad to say about it. The software is extremely easy to use. The only problem I have is trying to navigate the menu in the car (which I shouldn't be doing anyway) and really isn't the players fault I guess. One other thing is it only has a 3 bar battery monitor so when one bar is left you could have 10 mins or up to 8 hrs. Other than that though it is perfect. After using my brother's IPOD for a month prior to getting this, the Micro is preferable in many ways (most important to me is ease of use and it is considerably smaller)."
2,It'll do,"I've have my ZEN Micro for over 2 years. I've sent mine back twice (without charge) for software issues. I can no longer use the Creative computer software to upload music because it doesn't recognize my player. But I with Windows Media Player Sync and that works out fine. I just learned to let it be and not mess with it too much. I have it filled to the max with music and listen to it daily. The charge life is less than i had hoped, barely making it thru an 8 hour work day.Favorite part: it is orange!"
2,pretty good mp3 player...but it doesnt last too long,"i've had this mp3 player for about 2 years now and it's been pretty good. Well it was for about a year anyway. After that the buttons pretty much stopped working. At first, it was just one and then gradually they all stopped working. It really sucks because this is a good mp3 player and it holds all my music but now i cant use it because the buttons dont work. Besides the buttons not working, it also doesnt hold a charge for very long. It lasts for about 4 hours until it dies. If you want a mp3 player that lasts long and is durable then you should probably keep looking because this definitly doesnt. But it was good while it lasted =/"
2,Disapointment,"I bought this the other day and was excited that a mp3 player with such large storage had a fm radio tuner which is great because I travel a lot so I get more music out of my mp3 player. When I got home and installed the 'Creative MediaSource' I spent 5 hours trying to get my music from iTunes into it. Only 350 went in out of 1,348, then it started to delete songs off of my computer. Just all by it's self it errored out at least 200 and deleted 100 without any sign. The 'songs' that were now in the 'creative' mediaSoure were mostly old podcasts and music tripled. I really love the zen, it looks great, love the blue with the black and the fading when it idles the headphones are awesome, but I'm going to have to turn to the iPod. Something that is in print 'Compatible with iTunes'"
1,Very poor PC integration,"What an awful integration with XP!The syncronization is problematic. I got errors like ""General error"" during the syncronization with XP. What is one supposed to deduce from such a detailed error? This is not something I would expect from a mature product, and it is not something I ever got with my iPod.If you want to hear podcasts, you will have to use their ZenCast software. This product is, at best, in the beta stage. I found it impossible to sync the Zen Micro with the software.All in all, I would say that the iPod is a much better product."
2,Poor tecnical support,"I purchased this product to take with me on a deployment to Afghanistan. It has never really worked for me. At first I simply had problems loading music onto it. I spent the better part of a day on customer support and they were unable to fix the problem. I ran out of time before I deployed and now my customer service period is over. For a while I was able to listen to the few songs I had gotten loaded but now my operating system keeps crashing. Perhaps I got a bogus unit, but not being in a position to spend weeks dealing with it I have been left with a poor experience."
1,The R,"This is a VERY bad album. Who ever does not think so is just not a REAL music fan!(also it does not matter HOW BIG you type your words the album is GARBAGE!)Where do I start, well for one when I heard this album I could not get past the lack of creativeness in the lyrics. Do your self a favor and get a album from a REAL artist like Jill St. Soul."
5,Growing Readers: Units of Study in the Primary Classroom,"As a literacy coach for a large public school system, I feel every 1st grade teacher should challenge themselves to strive for a classroom that resembles Kathy's. In this book, she shares insights on exactly how to do this. What an outstanding text and a MUST for every primary teacher!"
5,When the Sky is Like Lace,This book is a true treasure. I am 22 years old and recieved this book when I was 4. I am completly in love with this story and still read it all the time. I wish it was not out-of-print and that every child could read this book. This book is the work of an amazing imagination. I always hoped that I could walk barefoot with gooseberry jam under my feet.
1,when the sky is like lace,This product was an old library book that was stamped to be destroyed. Why would I want something like that?
5,All time best children's book,"The artwork in this book is beyond belief. The story evokes an imagination that goes on for weeks after the story has been read. As a child I often found myself looking through a Kleen-x to see if the man on the moon would wink at me and on good nights (when my mother was up for it) he 'would' wink, so we would immediately start the spaghetti!"
3,"Sorry to Break the ""5"" Star Chain","This book was just ok. I think the unrealistic scenes and bad editing issues is what turned me off. Yes, we have all had a hustler at one point in our lives, but to be so young and your parents allow you to be ""A Hustler's Wife""...I don't think so!I bought this book because I thought it would be a a ""GROWN"" woman dealing with the effects of being with a big time drug dealer. This story wasn't like that all. Sorry Miss Turner."
5,A true story?,This book was excellent. Nikki Turner makes this just as though you are living this story. Listed as a fable but seems so real. Excellent
3,Interesting,This book was o.k. I liked the relationship between the character Yarni and her mother. Some parts of the story was a little unbelievable but overall it was a pretty good read.
4,big baby,"Yarni is a spoiled brat who has to face the real world after her boyfriend is locked up. She thinks she can find another drug dealer to take his place, but boy was she wrong."
1,"If I could rate no stars, I would..","My thirteen-year-old can write better than this.I got through the second paragraph and had to MAKE myself continue. I couldn't even get to the third page. With sentences like ""Des' mother, had Joyce, accompanied her as a favor to her son."" It's amazing this book got published. Where were the editors/proofreaders?It's sad the state our young Black readers are in that this book had a good rating on this site. I can't even comprehend what the author is trying to convey half the time. I'm glad I didn't buy this and checked it out from the library; I would have been highly upset. The fact that the headers for the pages aren't aligned properly and that they use capital letters in the middle of the sentences should have given me a hint on what's to come. Please don't buy this book. I have nothing against urban contemporary Black fiction (I actually am a fan), but I'm warning you!"
1,Don't quit your day job!,"This book was terrible. How can Nikki Turner even call herself a writer with a straight face? There was no character development, she jumped around from place to place, and the whole story was unrealistic. Next time get a better editor too!"
3,It was oooook,"Nothing big. I thought after reading the reviews and because of her name that the book would have been better but I was so wrong. It was dull, no excitement and was just average. Sorry"
5,YOU HAVE TO KNOW THIS LIFE TO UNDERSTAND IT !,REASON I LOVE THIS BOOK CAUSE I KNOW A LOT WOMEN AND GIRLS THAT LIVE LIFE LIKE IS. IN LIFE YOU GOT TO BE PLAYED WITH OTHER WISE YOU DONT LEARN SO I WHY SHE HAD TO GO THROUGH ALL THE MEN TO END UP ON TOP. THIS ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS IVE READ IN MY LIFE AS A YOUNG GIRL IT TAUGHT ME WHAT KIND OF MEN TO STAY AWAY FROM AND THE ONES YOU RUN FROM. I READ THIS BOOK WHEN I WAS 16 SO IT WAS A REALLY GOOD READ FOR ME THEN AND NOW.
3,So Was She A Ride R Die Chic????,"So it was an ok read to me some parts was very funny lol...well i read this book awhile back but i cant say that it was jus all that great,and im thinkin it was cause my friends had told me so much about it...but still buy it it was ok to me!!!!!"
4,Very Good Book,I kept putting purchasing this book off until I finally decided to go ahead and purchase. Good Choice. I loved this book. It was very good from the beginning until the end. Read it in 2 days.
2,Just didn't see it...,"Okay, first off...I give credit for the cover and title, nice job, but the book itself, I just didn't see the hype about it...the plot was mediocre, if not dull and preditable. Yarni was supposed to be a hustler's wife, but I felt that she kept getting played throughout the book, and the book was poorly edited...fo' real. I give Nikki her props for trying and pushing it out there, but there were some scenes that were not believable and maybe just too over the top and c'mon...I just don't see the moms black mailing all these big time officials just to get Yarn's man out of jail...dude was doing like life or sumthin...and that whole happy ending thing for a drug dealer, finally being let free and reuniting with his girl...c'mon...the moms would have been dead and so on...but once again, I just don't see the hype in this book..."
3,3.5 Good Read,"I read this novel in 2 days. It was a good book, not great. The age of Yarni bothered me, at 15 to actually have LOVE of that magnitude, was kinda hard to believe. However, all in all it was a good read. What I liked most about the book were the bible verses and all that old school advice that your Momma or Granny used to give you!Yarni's character was off the hook, she was a smart female and I loved how she thought."
2,Not Very Good,"Well, It was kindas stupid. It jumped around a lot. It was quite unbelieveable. Every man she met was rich they all loved her spent all their money on her screwed her over she made it out unscathed and the whole time her man was cool wit all these other dudes she was screwing please!!!! I also have part 2. Part 1 does not set me up to want to read it in a hurry though........."
4,Life in the streets,"In Turner's debut novel, The Hustler's Wife, you meet Yarni: a young girl who has never really wanted for anything. At 15 she meets, Des, the love of her life, the man she is going to marry, until he finds himself in an awkward situation.Now, Yarni has to swallow her pride and return home to her mother; who has always kept the door open for her - including a spare room. When she can't be with Des, she must find other means to `survive on the streets'. She plays the game and does it well. The game even catches up with her, but she lands on her feet.Turner takes you in the clubs, streets, and jails of Richmond, Virginia through the many exploits of Yarni. This book is a definite page turner, keeping you on a never ending journey. I enjoyed this story because you feel every twist and turn as if you were the one going through the drama. I would recommend it to others, and anxiously await Ms. Turner's next novel.JackiR.E.A.L. Reviewers"
2,Do not waste your time,"I picked this book up mainly to support an african-american author, while I do not regret supporting her I do regret buying the book I truely felt this was a waste of my time and hers. There were many words left out of the book, many grammar errors and the list goes on. I also felt the author started out writing a love story then changed her mind and tried to turn this into a mystery/horror story. I would not recommend buying this title."
1,Anyone can get published...,"This was the first time I read a book where the author couldn't write, let alone tell a good story. The ending is predictable, the plot is nonexistent (along with the periods, comas, spacing, and spelling corrections, that were rarely used when they were needed.) Don't waste your time, money, or energy, cause by the 20th page you'll regret it. Just words of advice."
5,"Outstanding, a lesson to be learned","This was a outstanding book i recommand this book to anyone who is thinking about buying it. Not only because its good but also it has a few messages. Never let anyone or anything get in the way of your education, if you have a chance to further your education did do it, It's good to be indenpent so that you don't have to denp on some one else there's nothing like having your own money, and if you are involved with anyone that are similar to the characters in this book you need to be smart and learn to save for rainy days. This book was interesting from start to finish."
3,Good book if you can get past the errors,"This book has a good story, unfortunately the book is ripe with typos, grammatical errors, and misspellings! But, if you can get past it then the book is a good read. i said good and not excellent."
4,Definitely Worth the Read....,"""A Hustler's Wife was a pretty good book. I am not familiar with Turner's writing, so this was my first experience. There were a lot of publishing errors and missed words. I had to use context clues to figure some things out, but overall, it was an easy read. It was a page turner, but not quite the page turner I expected after reading the reviews. By the time I finished the book, I was ready for the sequel. However, I will say that one thing I LOVE about Turner is how she incorporated spirituality into the street. That was hot!! Either way, I would say pick it up and read it, but buy it on Amazon.com."
5,Very good read,This book was off the chain. I couldn't put it down because I saw much of myself in her. It show a woman does what a woman gotta do and she did just that with sweet revenge. if you want a book thats straight hood and will give it to you raw buy it. Not many are living her good life but outside of that you can really relate to how a woman takes care of her man when he's down. Great read *****
3,An okay read,The book is alright to read. As you read it you can't help but feel that there is something missing. Several gramatical errors irritate. My advice is Don't expect too much!!
2,A Hustler's Wife,"I did not like the book. It was too fictional. No man would continue to spend money on a woman (with gifts way to extravagant) with her keeping contact with her husband. If you love a man you wouldn't cheat on him no matter what, I have filled Yarni's shoes and haven't cheated. Yarni made it seem like she loved Dess so much but was living a double life. All in one chapter she decides to get right find the lord and stand by him; after a book full of her deceiving him. I was real excited to read the book because I heard so much about it, but after doing so I was very disappointed."
2,not a good hustler,"This book was marginal, at best. I don't see how Yarni ever ""hustled"" anyone. A more accurate description would be to say she prostituted herself for material things. And the characters were as inconsistent as the narration of the book itself, it jumped around and so did the characters as they jumped in without any prior reference. Overall, the book was boring. I would not recommend it at all."
1,Where were the proof readers ??,"The grammar, english language usage and poor use ofspeaking in the correct tense made this book unreadablefor the most part. I can't believe something like thiswas actually printed on paper and published!Not the story (hey I'm as down as the next sister) butthe atrocious read. With all those acknowledgements atthe front, someone should have included a proofreader !!I want a refund from the publisher for taking advantage."
3,It Will Do,"Rating this book is somewhat difficult. Nikki Turner did an o.k. job to me. Now if you compare it to The Coldest Winter Ever, it is garbage. But just to read, it will do. I gave the book a 3 which is an average rating. But The Coldest Winter Ever deserves 10 stars! You can tell Nikki is familiar with the streets. Some of the events were funny and real. I was getting ready to say that her being fifteen and all she went through is unrealistic, but it isn't. Plenty of girls fall in love with men that sell drugs and go for the ride of whatever the dope game brings. That is what this book is about. A girl who falls in love with an older drug dealer and what happens in her life when he is locked up. The book is worth reading, but it has a long way to go to reach the level of Sister Souljah's book."
5,SUCH A GREAT BOOK!,"i loved this book as well as the the sequal! i couldnt put them down! i dont want to ruin the story so i am not gonna go on and on about what happened in the story but it was well worth my money and if you like reading books about living the high life and the struggles that come along with it you will love this book as well as the sequal ""Forever A Hustlers Wife."""
2,Unrealistic and Ebonic Read,I read this book expecting more and I was disappointed. It was poorly written and the characters and the story was plain unrealistic.MY MAIN GRIPE with this book is the editing! There were more than two dozen typos and misspellings throughout the book! Pathetic.I will never read anything again by this author.
4,great book,wonderful book that shipped quickly. Finished this book in two days...the author did quite well with this writing and combined all other books as well. Love her writing
3,She wasn't a hustler's wife till the very end!,"While reading this book,I could really tell that this was one of Nikki Turner's earlier novels.Thank God her writing has improved over the years.Even though this book wasnt great it was still an ok read. There were quite a few errors and some things seemed a bit repetitive. Yarni was very mature for a 15 year old girl but some things and scenarios were very unbelievable.I really thought the story was gonna focus more on Yarni and Des..but it was focused on Yarni and ""other dudes"".I felt like something was missing but I cant quite put my finger on it.The ending was ok..nothing really that blew me away.But Im glad that after all these years I finally got a chance to read this novel."
1,Seriously?,"I am having a hard time reading this book, I used to push my way through books like this but now I just stop, no use wasting my time on a book that is not catching and keeping me. I am on page 32..if I get to 50 and i'm not reeled in..I'm giving up!!"
4,Good story,I thought the book was a good story. I did wonder if there was some truth to it. I would recommend it for men and women in their 20s and 30s.
4,i liked it,"this book was a good book but the only problem i had about it was on how the characters handled their situations and how they were pertrayed, other than that it was a good book and it had a happy ending!!!"
3,It Was... OK,This book was OK. I liked the book and all but it just lacked suspense. I just really couldn't get into it. Instead I would suggest reading The Coldest Winter Eva ad No Disrespect by: Sista SouljahTrue To The Game-Terri WoodsB-More Careful-Shannon HolmesFlyy Girl-Omar Tyree
1,Combo of Flyy Girl and Coldest Winter Ever,"This book was poorly written. The dialogues were hard to follow along with the constant grammatical errors. I'm not really sure what the point of the novel was. The main character, Yarni, did not grow or change throughout the book. Her life was ridiculously unrealistic, in my opinion). I'm guessing it was just another testimony of the lives of young materialistic women. Its not on the level of Flyy Girl or Coldest Winter Ever but it seems that there was an attempt to tell those stories in Virginia instead of NY and Philly."
3,Proofreader for Hire,"I have to agree with Kavetta Ameen from the ATL. Nikki Turner's stories are okay but she needs to hire proofreaders. I even went so far as correcting the grammar and spelling errors in my personal copy and believe you me, there were a lot of them. I have also read A Project Chick and I was very annoyed at the fact that the book was even published because the errors in that publication were astronomical to say the least. Use spellcheck for crying out loud!!!!!!"
3,Not a Bad Read,"I read many of the reviews for this book, so I expected it to be okay. That's what it was, it was an alright read (I read it in less than 1 day), but it was a bit unrealistic in the end. I did like this book, there weren't that many sex scene descriptions like some of the other books of this kind (True to the Game, Coldest Winter Ever). It's definitely not as good as the coldest winter because that was the realest book of this kind that I have ever read. Overall, this book did what I purchased it for, it helped me pass the time."
3,WHAT WAS HER MOMS THINKING,I READ THIS BOOK IN TWO DAYS. I DONT THINK IT WAS BECAUSE IT WAS GOOD I THINK IT WAS BECAUSE I WAS BORED! THIS BOOK WAS COOL BUT I JUST EXPECTED A LITTLE MORE OUT OF THIS BOOK.YARNI HAD NO GUIDANCE WHEN IT CAME TO RELATIONSHIPSYARNI'S MOTHER WAS STUPID (YOU WILL SEE WHY)YARNI AND DES SHARED REAL LOVE
5,EXCEPTIONAL,"I FOUND THIS PARTICULAR BOOK TO BE VERY INTERESTING AND INTRIGING, CONSIDERING I'VE BEEN OUT OF SCHOOL SINCE 1989 AND IT'S THE 2ND BOOK SINCE, THAT'S CAUGHT MY ATTENTION."
3,Pitiful!!!,"I heard so much excitement about this book so I decided to look it over while in the bookstore. I could not believe what I read! I couldn't get past the 3rd page. It seems like something a kid in middle school wrote. The sentences where so boring with no description, no substance. The 1st character who was introduced, Joyce, was said to have style and class. Then in the same paragraph the author went on to describe her tackiness?????? That was a major turn off. I tried going to other chapters to see if I could get past the initial letdown, but it just got worse...I'm giving it 3 stars only because I didn't read the whole thing...SMHIf you read on a 5th or 6th grade level it just may be for you..."
1,Grammer,"Did anyone catch the grammatical errors that infected this book? Or just me? I was shocked to see page after page with so many errors. Did no one proofread this ""work"" before turning it in to the printer? I am just curious. Story line was a waste of text. Characters were unbelievable."
3,"Not your typical story, but its ok","I liked the storyline because it was sweet and all that, but it wasn't realistic. I don't care how he was brought up, a gangstas not gonna be THAT nice. He was actin like a prince and she was his princess. Nobodys that nice, she needs to be more realistic. He most likely woulda took advantage of her being so young and all. I dont kno anybody who spends that kinda $$ cause they like somebodys company, it dont work like that. The story was good and it WAS hard to put down, but it strayed a lot and certain parts were unrealistic, like in the club, a sheltered girl aint beatin up no project girl so simple, especially if shed never been in a fight in her life. I wasnt havin that"
1,To Unrealistic,"I searched high and low for this book and when I got it and read it is I was very dissapointed. I can usually read a book in about a day or two but I had to struggle to get threw this one. I dont mean to give the book away, but it is too unrealistic how a 22 year old man wanted to marry a 15 year old girl, and when her mother said no they did it any way, and the mother accepts it. Also it is to unreal how her mother just happens to be a caterer and takes these bogus pictures of the mayor and whoever doing whatever to one another and with that evidence Des gets out of jial sorry I don' t think so. I would not recommend this book at all."
1,What da hell was dat?,All I have to say is that this book was not urban drama it was just stupid drama. Another story about a female chasing money....zzzzzzzzz. This book just straight up lacked substance.Later!!!!
2,HUSTLA,fIRST OF ALL WHEN I ORDER THIS PRODUCT IT NEVER CAME THEN IT WAS SENT TO ME AGAIN AS A COURTESY. I DID RECIEVE THAT ONE. eVERYTIME I ORDER SOMETHING FROM AMAZON I NEVER GET IT. SOOO I'M VERY SKEPTICALLY ABOUT THIS WEBSITE.
4,Thanks for the page turner Nikki Turner!!,"I thought this book was great, it was definitely an easy read and a page turner. I can't wait to read the next one."
3,A HUSTLER'S WIFE,"FOR A FIRST NOVEL I FELT THAT IT WAS A GOOD STORY. THE PLIGHT OF THE THE MAIN CHARACTER IS INTERESTING AND DOES KEEP THE READER WANTING TO KNOW HOW THE STORY ENDS. I HAVE READ OTHER BOOKS THAT WERE BASED ON THE SAME TYPE OF ATOMOSPHERE (STREET LIFE), WHILE THE BOOK WAS PRETTY TRUTHFUL AND REALISTIC THERE WAS NOT VERY MANY SURPRISES. I FOUND MYSELF SKIPPING PAGES AND STILL BEING ABLE TO KEEP UP WITH THE STORY LINE. OVERALL I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS BOOK TO A FRIEND WHO HAS JUST STARTED TO REAL ABOUT STREET LIFE."
2,A Hustler's Wife,"I did not like the book. It was too fictional. No man would continue to spend money on a woman (with gifts way to extravagant) with her keeping contact with her husband. With my husband in prison a lot could be related to the book, but if I love him I'm not going to cheat on him. Yarni made it seem like she loved Dess so much but was living a double life. All in one chapter she decides to get right find the lord and stand by him; after a book full of her deceiving him. I was real excited to read the book because I heard so much about it, but after doing so I was very disappointed."
4,"This book had me sayin ""No he didnt..."" the whole time","This was a very good book, it would have got 5 stars but it was so many typos in it, but besides that this book is off the hook. It will literally have you sayin ""no he didnt"" almost from the very beginig till the very end because alot of men did Yarni wrong but she always had something in store to get them back harder.I recommend this book to anybody who have read ""B-More Careful"""
3,OK,"I am giving the book a 3 but that is really pushing it. I think it was an OK book. THE TYPO'S WERE RIDICULOUS. All the time she took in devoloping Yarni, she should have made us believe that she really had hustlin in her. I just couldn't see it. The end was like WHOA. After all this you mean to tell me dude did this bid for this guy. Who was this guy who was NEVA MENTIONED. I mean I hope your next book will be better devoloped."
3,Great....attempt,"This book had the potential to be a modern day ""gangsta"" Cinderella but I was confused with the authors point. Yarni played too many roles. Love her, hate her? God fearing, super sinner? Where were we going? Anyway, keep trying but for goodness sakes - fire the editor for the many, many typos! I'm an avid reader and I had to read over some of the sentences several times just to grasp what the typo was supposed to be. Take your time sista, the next one will be great!"
2,"Boring, really.","The title is catchy, along with the cover, but the content of the book i found to be pretty boring. I mean, Yarni didn't really grab me as a hustler's wife, it didn't flow to me, cause it seemed that the author was just putting Yarni in situations, cause she was trying to build a story. Sometimes, Yarni seemed too nice, and that kind of got on my nerves, i mean, niggahs did her dirty, and here she is, trying to play an angel to everyone--c'mon, i mean, lets get real, she's suppose to be a hustler's wife, not Marry Poppins. It took me quite some time to read through it, but i finished it. I gave this book two stars, because it had its moments, but other than that, i felt she was pushing the story too hard."
5,Hustler's Wife,"This book is the bomb! Nikki is off the hook and so is the book. Aside from some grammatical errors, the book was bomb. I read the book in one day, I didn't even want to stop to go to the bathroom. This book as it all, love, drugs, money, jewelry, everything! If you want a book that is worth buying, this one is it!"
2,Hustler's Wife,"I believe the book reminded me of a number of books I've already read.There were a number of grammatical errors in the book and even on the back cover. I thought the book should have been professionally edited before published. The characters you choose were good, but in all reality things don't end up like that. Overall the book was okay."
4,A Hustlers Wife,"This was a very good book. I did not want to put it down. It's not A Coldest Winter Ever, but close. If you like street life books as I do pick this one up. There are a lot of misspelled words and gramatical errors. Nikki girl,fire the editor or use spell check."
2,Don't Believe The Hype,"Um..can someone tell me please what all the hype was about? This book was just mediocre but the cover is pretty. I bought DON'T KNOCK THE HUSTLE by Stacy Nelson and there's no comparison. It's something about the TCP authors. Maybe they all need to branch out. I'll be getting Nikki's new one though, only because I love to read. Now that she's with a major publisher let's see what she comes with."
5,a find,Let me start by saying it was nice to finally find the book that began the series. I read the read the other books in this series. Having enjoyed the book's that followed I enjoyed having the foundation for this series
4,Pretty Good...,"I received this book on a Saturday and finished reading it on Sunday. I would say it held my attention, especially all of the typos, spelling and grammar mistakes (did she ever hear of a Spell Check?). But, other than that, I was entertained by all the gold-digging, back-stabbing, boyfriend-stealing events. I would purchase another book by this author."
4,not that bad,"I read this book a few weeks back, it wasn't a bad read. It talks about a girl name Yarni that's a somewhat sheltered child. She hooks up with a balla name Des... his mama was off the hook!lol. it's a good book and has allot of ups and downs. The book ends really well."
3,Yarni & Des,"For those of you debating whether or not you should purchase this book, I would recommend not to. I would suggest searching for it at your local library because this book is not worth the money charged. The plot of this story was sweet but I believe it could have been better.The novel ""A Hustler's Wife"" written by author Nikki Turner is based on the character ""Yarni"". Yarni is a young beautiful girl who doesnt realize how much her looks influence those dirty looks she recieves from men. Her body grew in faster than her age, and she's caught the particular eye of an older man named ""Des"".Des and Yarni finally get things ""poppin"" after a while but unfortantely, Des gets popped and is spending some hefty time in the joint. Now that Yarni is by herself, she needs to figure out a way to make ends meet and care for herself because all she ever did was rely on Des.Follow Yarni on the journey to self independence while she fights for her mans freedom."
2,The Imperial City ..... Short-Changed,"Initially unimpressed by the first chapter of the book, in which Freely provides a cursory summation of Byzantium's early history, I was amazed to find on page 13, the first of Chapter 2, that he mistakenly identified Mesembria (modern day Nesebar)as the Greek colony closest to the Bosphorus. It was in fact, and still is, Apollonia Pontika (modern day Sozopol), which was one of the earliest Greek foundations (late 7th century B.C.). The rest of the book is an assemblage of information, much of which will not be particulary useful to a visitor. The book's saving grace is an excellent bibliography for the reader to explore. For tourists, the ""DK Eyewitness Travel Guide - Istanbul"" is a far better companion; easier to carry, containing excellent color photographs and diagrams,and full of historical information."
2,Not what I was expecting....,"I'm about 150 pages into this book. If you're interested in geneology - who gave birth to who - this is the book for you. The book briefly mentions the Hagia Sophia - it briefly mentions what lead to the schism between the Greek and Roman Churches but continues to onslaut the reader with geneology - which has become a bit boring. No doubt the author has done his research - but I was hoping to get a better idea of what Istanbul was like - the arts, the food, the architecture. There is an index of monuments at the end of the book. I'll continue to slog away and let you know...."
3,Interesting,"A little too detailed for what I was after, but an excellent history of this wonderful city."
2,"Full of facts, but dull","This book does have a lot of information about Istanbul, but it's the kind of book that someone would finish only if he or she were living in Istanbul or going there on an extended visit. The book isn't really entertaining in itself, but there are lots of facts and dry anecdotes about the city's history.A better, more interesting, book on historical Istanbul is Constantinople : City of the World's Desire 1453-1924 by Philip Mansel.As for Freely on contemporary Istanbul, he is never able to give the reader a feeling for what it's like to spend time with the people who live in Istanbul, like Max Rodenbeck is able to do in his book about another city, Cairo: The City Victorious. There must be better books about Istanbul out there."
4,Bring this book to Istanbul with you!,This is one of the few books that both covers the complete history of Constantinople/Byzantium/Istanbul and at the same time serves as an excellent travel guide. The list and description of Istanbul's monuments and churches helped me immensly as I visited the city last month. The book does not go into enough depth on any of the historical subjects but is a great overview of the city's history.
4,Great Read,"I read this while exploring Istanbul- made history come more alive while I was there and, while not a travel guide, has useful info on important sites in the city in an appendix."
4,"Morbid, but accurate","Musa, the protagonist, wins both respect and money by his salesmanship. He is extreme in his lack of integrity, as he must be to make the novel's point - that we give our money and our bodies to attractive personalities; integrity does not count. We saw it vividly in the OJ Simpson trial, and we see it again in ""Quarantine."" Musa and OJ survive and flourish by winsome tactics, while Jesus and Marta die and suffer rape in their integrity. It is the way of things.The man, Jesus, in ""Quarantine"" does not ring true with Jesus of the Bible. Mr. Crace should have given him a different name.The book is excellent in its development of Musa's character. It loses verisimilitude toward the end where many details seem forced."
1,"meandering, pointless and confusing","What begins as an inquisitive study of the humanity and divinity of Jesus meanders to a disappointing conclusion. Character development and geographical descriptions are excellent; that is all except for the central character. All the supposed mysticism, parallels and theology fall flat on their faces. A very compulsive yet unsatisfying read."
4,Not for those who take their Bibles literally,"In the beautifully written _Quarantine_, Jim Crace takes one of the least edified Gospel stories - Jesus' temptations in the desert - and throws it on its proverbial ear. The Jesus who is portrayed here is all too human, but prays to be something more, wrestling with his own demons - and only wins his heart's desire by losing the ultimate battle. All of the characters in the book go through a transformation at the end, although it is left up to the reader to choose what those transformations are and what they mean. While the pacing is definitely slower than most other modern novels, it is well worth the effort. If you engage the book it will certainly make you think. A satisfying read for the open-minded."
2,"Jesus Christ, Supersnore","Sonewhere in California, 1998---YOU ARE THERE!! ""So, dude, like what do you think Jesus, like, actually DID for 40 days in the wilderness, man?"" ""I don't know, dude. Like, what would you do? For 40 days, c'mon man, like who would know?"" ""No, I mean it...wait a minute, wait a minute. Like, suppose there were like other dudes there, too. Y'know?"" ""Dude! That's awesome! Like a really awesome chick or something. And a total stone stud blonde guy!"" ""Yeah, and a bad guy, too...a Jabba the Hutt kind of guy."" ""Cool! Like we should write a book or something. Y'know?"" Too late, dudes! Jim Crace beat you too it!! What a disappointment this book is! It strikes me as a classic case of it seemed like a good idea at the time. As a concept, the idea is interesting, but I couldn't care less about the characters as written. Even Jesus' struggle with his divinity just doesn't engage. I give it two stars for some beautifully written passages which are, alas, few and quite far between. Too bad."
5,"hugely impressive, so carefully written and precise","I found this novel hugely impressive and the language so carefully and precisely used, that the intrusion of Jesus (the latin form of his name) into such a carefully constructed Judaie world was a real irritant. Why not use the Hebrew/Jewish name of Joshua bar Joseph? If you think that your audience isn't clever enough to have equated Joshua with Jesus by the end of the novel surely you're smart enough to drop us a few more clues? Similarly I thought every child who had been to Sunday School knew that'forty days' was a New Testament idiom for a 'long time' (forty years a very long time). This realisation would have released you from the adherence to be factual, literal timetable and forced you to use a tighter time-frame, for I believe that human beings cannot survive more than 5 - 7 days without water, 25 days without food. Having said all of this, I'll recommend this novel to all my friends."
4,He makes you think.,"Jim Crace's novels are so different from one another that it's hard to believe they're written by the same person. Quarantine, that's ostensibly about Christ's 40 days in the desert, really revolves around the others staying in caves while Christ goes through his forty day fast.The other characters are very interesting: there is a woman who wishes her husband had stayed dead, there is a merchant suffering from a terminal illness, and there are several other unique individuals to interact with these. The novel's central idea involves the self-imposed suffering of people and their reasons for it.This novel will likely upset those with strong views on either side of this issue in terms of religion. The funny part of that, however, is that the novel isn't really about religion per se, it's about the way that people perceive religion. All in all, this is a thought-provoking novel well worth your time."
4,Jim Crace's Dark Adapted Eye,"Jim Crace reminds me of De Niro in Raging Bull. He will go to any lengths to get it right, go to any extreme. Hardened readers crumble in amazement as the excruciating experience of starving to death is gradually enacted at the crossroads of history, curiously off set by the morbid misdeeds of an unlikely Satan and his band of captives. The writer must submit to such extremes, be a visionary, a master conjuror. This is a visceral historical parable that unrolls effortlessly in an unobtrusive blend of idiom and cinematic imagery. Not since Ancient Evenings (though Mailer's Jesus book seems puny by comparison) has any writer of historical fiction I have encountered used the language with such wizardry and finesse. The psychological interplay and characterisations are unforgetable, utterly convincing."
3,A strange work,"I didn't really know what to expect when I purchased this book, only that the subject (Jesus's 40 day sojourn in the desert) intrigued me. Having read this strange, disquieting little book, I'm not quite sure how to respond to it. Well-written it certainly is, but I'm not quite sure that I got the point of it, or if there even is a point to get! The enigmatic ending alone was enough to make me think that I probably missed the author's intent throughout the work. If you enjoy well-written books with believeable characters, read this work: if you like your tales to at least appear to have some rhyme or reason to them, stay away from this one."
4,A vivid and well crafted tale.,Jim Crace's QUARANTINE was a compelling and ultimately moving retelling of one of the pivotal moments in New Testament narratives. It vividly recreated the often brutal realities of ancient middle eastern existence. In the barreness of the desert and in the barreness of the characters' lives there are suprising signs of life. I suspect that believers and non-believers will both gain insights from this beautifully crafted tale.
2,"poor quality, don't waste your money",Very cheaply made and fell apart within a month. Save yourself the aggravation and spend a little more for a better piece!
4,perfect album,"This is the most perfect album I ever have from Gene Pitney so far, the finest recordings with a fair price tag too. Most of the tracks brought back memories of my younger days. As a matter of facts, I only heard a few of his most hits like Town without pity, Man who shot Liberty Valance, 24 hours from Tulsa, It hurts to be in love, Only love can break a heart and Something's gotten hold of my heart over the radio airwaves in the early sixties. So this 25 All time greatest hits I thought only a few tracks like I mentioned above were all I wanted, To my surprise most of the tracks are wonderful. For those who need a relaxation listening pleasure, take my opinion. Peter Lee"
5,Pathos and Power,"When my son asked me what I wanted for father's day in 2004, I immediately chose 25 All-Time Greatest Hits as I had seen Gene Pitney in a sold out concert on March 27, 2004. The decision to go was a last minute one. My wife and I ended up amazingly with sixth row center stage tickets in the beautiful 2800 seat Proctors Theater built in 1926 in Schenectady NY. His performance was flawless. He could have taught the American Idol contestants a thing or two.The CD captures the essence of his singing style, his powerful and soaring tenor and his softer romantic yearnings.As much as I appreciate the British Invasion groups of the mid 60's, the downside was the slow demise of singers such as Pitney, Roy Orbison and Del Shannon among many others both male and female. Even Elvis was knocked out for a few years. It's great that Gene was still touring, sounding magnificent and in great physical shape. My hope in seeing him again is gone. The CD will have to suffice"
4,Why isn't he in the R&R Hall of Fame?,"How many times can this gifted songwriter and performer be overlooked? I received the CD a few weeks ago and it has not been out of the cartridge yet. A unique voice to accompany a long, boring drive to work. I have long appreciated ""The Rockville Rocket""."
5,my husband really likes this CD!,this was a gift for my husband... he really likes this cd. It is a true classic.... I would highly reccommend this one!
5,Swinney review,"This is by far the best compilation of his best music! I never get tired of listening to it. It proves that Gene Pitney can sing anything and make it sound good. I'll never understand why his songs never made number one! But that's ok. They'll always be number one with me. In fact, my co-workers that have never listened to him before now, think he is great. I've never got to see him in concert. I hope I'll be able to in the future. I've been a fan since I was nine. Gene sings each song with feeling and passion. This album is the ultimate Gene Pitney."
2,Died within a year!,This product had issues within a year of buying it. It started with only missing a section of a song at a time and ended with only playing a song or two before dying. I felt that it should have lasted a lot longer. Replaced it with a quality Yamaha player.
5,great product,"Worked like a charm. It came just as it looks in the picture.. actually the box was a little cooler looking in person. My nails are way stronger, and they're smooth now, no peeling, no marks. It takes a while for this product to work its magic. I use it as a base coat for my polish, and it works well as a base."
2,Broke right away,"I was really excited to give this to my State fan for Christmas, but it broke 2 days after Christmas. I have contacted the seller regarding this but have not heard back yet. I also purchased a U of M one for my other son, and that one broke as well, in the same spot. Two different sellers, same style watch, makes me think it is a manufactures defect. The watch face is very nice, and the band is nylon and fits small wrists well, so I am hoping that this gets taken care of quickly."
1,I thought I was buying another book,"A bit too mystical for my taste....and does not harmonize with my theology...since I am very technical with what the Bible says vs. what some man writes, I did not like this book."
4,a stayer,"I've owned this wonderful CD by Lucy Kaplansky for a number of years now and I have to say that it only gets better and better. From the opening title track to the haunting closure of 'A child's hands', Kaplansky's album is chock full of touching lyrics and tender melodies. 'For once in your life' is the highlight for me; a beautiful, lyrical ode to friendship and forgiveness. 'One good reason' will remain one of the most evocative songs in my personal collection for a good while longer I imagine. And she is a joy to sing along with. The only reason I give the album four stars is because I find some of the slower love songs (Promise Me and Just You Tonight) a little too dreamy and sluggish. But I think that will change as I get older. Proving again that this is an album for your life, not just today, but tomorrow and the next year and the next. If you like meaningful lyrics and pristine melodies, Ten Year Night is for you."
3,A decent effort but not her best,"I bought this after reading the online reviews that all gave her five stars... beware of online reviews that all give five stars. It's not a bad record but she's done better. I'm a big Shawn Colvin fan and I know they started out together but LK's voice is not Shawn's, it's actually a bit nasally. Listenable, but that's it."
2,"Okay, but not great","I have to be honest, I was disappointed by this CD. I already had Flesh and Bone and loved it (still do). To me, this one is nowhere near as good. I saw her touring in support of this album and sing all the songs live before I heard the studio versions. I'll take her and her guitar onstage any day to the fully worked up with a backing band version. In particular, the song ""Turn the Lights Back On"" was oozing with raw emotion and hurt at the concert. The song sounds rather tame on the disc, by comparison. So Lucy is still a great artist, but I'd recommend you buy Flesh and Bone instead."
5,Ten very good songs.,"I have learned that any recording that includes Larry Campbell's work is going to sound good. He's on this album and the sound is very good. You might have heard Larry with Cry, Cry, Cry or on Richard Shindell's solo work--among other places. The star of this disc, though, is Lucy Kaplansky. Her songs are witty and insightful and nearly always include a catchy hook or melody to stay with you long afer the stereo is turned off. Among the truly excellent songs is ""One Good Reason"" with Shindell singing backup. With no duds in the mix and a very talented singer leading the show, this disc is sure to provide many hours of great listening."
4,Want to understand KM!,"If you read only one book on KM, this is it. Dr. Frid's book on KM is an EXCELLENT introduction! It's extremely well-founded and provides a solid, practical strategy for building KM systems which collect and re-use experience and facilitate collaboration. This book is particularly well suited for those in management who want to have a grasp of the big KM picture but don't want to get too far into the details. Dr. Frid's book is an easy read and presents a great deal of insight into the process of setting up KM systems which work. This insight reflects experience with more than one instance of implementing KM.If I had to offer any criticism, there are two shortcomings. First and foremost, his narrow focus on Microsoft products as the solution to every need (well, almost every need) is weak. On the other hand, a survey of the technology can be found in Amrit Tiwana's outstanding book, The Knowledge Management Toolkit. Second, he has"
1,Not in use,Bought two pistols and two of these sights. One the dot light is not working the other has problems with it moving because the screw gets loose. And if you do get one of these sights when trying to slip battery out the hold down screw will break at the base so unscrew the hold down for the battery. Bought a better sight and not frustrated with this sight.
3,not bad,this point sight dont work to bad i put it on my rifle and my hand gun and it gives you a point of view to shoot at. not the best but it works.
3,Daisy sight conversion,"The Daisy sight works fine converted to an astronomical telescope sight. The addition of a potentiometer to dim the red light and polishing off the reflective coating on the lens made a fine, cheap addition to a six inch scope."
2,DOVETAIL REALLY?,"its a great point sight but come on they made it for a dovetail rail! why not picatiny, it doesnt fit on any of my guns!"
3,Daisy Scope,"Bought it at Walmart for $7... I'm may return it because I thought it actually projected a laser onto the target, which it doesn't. It's more of a high tech scope that uses a laser dot, which is nice but not what I wanted. I had no problems mounting, had it hooked up in less than 30 seconds..."
3,Works fine,Pretty easy to sight in and I like how small it is. I just wish it wasn't so easy to break. The instructions weren't clear on how to open the battery hatch. I couldn't get it to open so I ended up using more force than needed and I broke the spring that holds the battery in place. Luckily I was able to get it to work with tape. I wish the instructions were clearer but I guess for $10 you can't expect to much.
1,Daisy Dud,"My blunder wanted to try something different and this surly was , If it only worked as good as it looked . I bought it to use and a Daisy gun and what a let down has only 4 screws 2 to attach unit to gun and 2 to adjust sight , you can turn screws either way and had no response . Biggest let down is I used on a daisy 5170 BB gun , Not impressed dont waste your money step up and by a better product."
3,Decent Buy,"Product is small and fits perfectly on my dovetail Crosman 3576. It looks nice, and the laser is plenty bright. There is a bright and dim adjustment option. On the contrary, the plastic is cheap (thin), I did crack the battery cover trying to remove it because it was a little sticky. When I took out of the packaging the battery was loose and jiggling inside. Perhaps, I just got a bad apple out of the deal. So, I added a piece of Scotch tape to hold the battery in place, and some more to get the cover to stay on. It looks decent, and works still. Only problem now is that I have to shake the gun to re-adjust the battery now and then when the laser light goes out.Otherwise, a good buy for the price. Be gentle with it, and have fun!"
2,Was this from the dollar tree?!?!?!?!,when i got the package i was so happy then i opened the sight package and it was cheap plastic and just did not feel right so i put it on the gun i bought it for and it had a part of its plastic broken off and it does not turn on
3,Good accesory if your are on the budget,It works.... but if you are lloking for the best accuracy of your gun... you'll have to spend some more dollars to get a better sight.
5,One of thee Best,Nicole C. Mullen music from this c/d is thee best inspirational music that I have listen to for months on the way to work. Her spirit is beautiful. One of my friends was playing her c/ds in her store and I said who is singing this? I fell in love with her music and so did many of my friends! I have bought 3 of her c/ds so far...
2,Not really crazy about this,"Although I love NC, this cd wasn't what I was hoping for. She does have a lot of inspirational songs on this cd, but they are more like story songs and not songs you can sing along to."
2,Mediocre atlas. I've seen much better.,"I hate to say it, but unfortunately I was very unimpressed with this book. One good feature is the informative and concise descriptions of all the pathologies. These are useful.However, the printing quality is very poor & the image quality is also bad especially for radiographs. It is really too bad that the pictures are so poor. I wouldn't recommend buying this book. I also own the Lexi Comp hard and soft tissue atlases and find them to be much more useful."
4,Hope I'm That Young When I'm Old,"The premise... Four elderly (60-ish) couples decide to build homes at Paxton Court and retire together there. All the homes a painted shades of purple and the neighbors have mixed reactions. I must admit it was a little difficult for me to think about couples in their twilight being sexually active (at least as active as these folks are), but Salvatore does such a nice job keeping things realistic and tasteful this reader forgot how old the characters are.This is truly a great love story -- not only within each couple, but between the eight friends. As they deal with one especially troublesome neighbor, they make fast friends with several others who know about and overlook their ""lifestyle.""This isn't one I'll keep permanently on my bookshelf, but I'm glad I got the chance to read it."
3,A Good Novel that just missed,"I would like to give this novel a higher rating because I enjoyed it and Salvatore is a good writer--but this novel just missed it by not being long enough or in depth enough. Part of the problem is that if she was going to make so many characters she needed to make the novel longer so we could identify with them. Most are never shown in enough depth to quite become attached to them. And the ending is rushed. If we were going to feel that Rich was going to choose Rudy over the young and handsome Greg, we needed to SEE the scene where Rich and Rudy come to a greater understanding, not just be told that it happened.The ending made sense and was even touching in places, but I just didn't feel it because she was skimming over the people. This is still worth reading whether you are gay or not. While there are homophobes in it, decent, understanding straights are plentiful and this is more about learning to live together as human beings than one's sexuality."
5,More relaxing Music,"Here's another Oliver Shanti disc that I adore, every cd is different from one another, some are for Meditating others are for easy listening"
2,hard to understand,I want to check the garmmar with this book but this book is really hard to understand. Very difficult explanations.
2,Disappointing,"When I purchased this book I was looking forward to another engaging story with sizzle from Ms. Walker. Unfortunately, it didn't deliver. The characters are likable and engaging, but the stroy simply doesn't deliver.Because the timeline makes a rather clumsy ""jump"" from one event to travel back and tell the bulk of the story, then back to the ""present"" for the finale, I had to take the time to figure out when the passages I was reading took place. Very distracting. In addition, I don't feel the reader is given enough information to understand the fantasy world that has been built for the story. This book also lacked the sensuality I have come to expect from Ellora's Cave.I've read enough of Ms. Walker's work to know she can write great stories with incredible hot scenes, but had this been my first Walker book, I would never consider buying another."
2,Skip It,"There is a need for such a ""tool"". No Latin person speaks as slowly as this CD presents the words. The idea is good,but it needs much improvement before it can be really useful for a person in the construction industry."
3,Of course it's slow,"Just a thought, responding to ""skip it"". Of course it's presented slowly, nobody can possibly learn a foreign language at the rate it's spoken by native speakers. I wouldn't expect the Spanish-speaking guys on my jobsite to pick up English the way I normally speak. We both slow down for each other, knowing we need time to process the phrases in our heads. Looking forward to getting this CD for our superintendents. I'm tired of translating for them!"
3,A one-sided and incomplete look at success.,"I fully understand Mrs. Dean's struggles and position. She truly became consumed with success. That as she points out is wrong and un-Christian. We are to be fully and totally given over to our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. However in her zeal to warn us from the dangers of materialism and greed - both sins- she has mistakenly isolated on ""tool"" of both. MLM is no more the problem than an 8 - 5 job. I was also in her position once but my ""MLM"" was the military. With any business, career or hobby for that matter, we can become overly consumed as was she. I think the book's message would be better targeted at greed, materialism and lust for power and fame - not a particluar type of business. For the record I am not in any MLM - But I find it truly distatsteful to mark any type of business opportunity as ""ungodly"" simply because we may or may not have had a bad experience in it."
5,Buy it.,"Words can do only injustice to this album, it must be listened to to be understood and fully enjoyed. It is also not a radiofriendly, shiny, single-filled album - the songs work as standalones but are really the brushstokes (heh) of an entire painting. Conceptual, but not heavyhanded, this is an aural masterpiece."
3,Promedio?,"Before you click the ""not helpful"" button remember a three star rating is not bad. This is the first Dredg CD I've heard and it is a decent listen. They have an alternative, dreamy groove going on with very subtle influences of U2, XTC and Radiohead scattered throughout the disc. There isn't any virtuoso playing and, for me, the timbre of the vocalist is an acquired taste, but the songs are well written and the segues are interesting. A good change of pace disc."
3,Disappointing,"The earlier album of dredg (Leitmotif) is absolute somewhere in my top 10 albums and I must have played that cd a zillion times.But I'm abit disappointed with this release, it's so different from Leitmotif. In my opinion, the only two tracks that come close is to the quality of Leitmotif is ""Brushstroke - New Heart Shadow"" and ""An Elephant jady jady jady""Like A. Marsh says in his review; After hearing three songs with the similair vocal sound it gets repetitive and annoying.Still this CD isn't bad compared to the masses of ringtone music. Dredg is still a very powerfull band and I really hope their next release will be beter."
3,I like the CD...,"Well its definetely a good album, however its not a must have or anything. I still think that they need to grow as a band a bit more. The guitar, bass, and drums are amazing. The delay the distortion and reverb are used perfectly with the masterful playing, however the singer still pisses me off. He seems like he's trying to do something like Radiohead and sing really high, but you can hear him having a difficult time hitting those notes. Thats the one thing that dissapointed me about the album. After reading the reviews I have to hear the rest of Leitmoff... the vocals aren't going to get any better until the next album though..."
2,A letdown.,"People have been recommending this band to me for over a year, and I just now got around to listening to them for the first time. My first reaction was that nothing about this rather long album caught my attention at all the first time I listened to it, and it really just seemed like background music. I tried listening to it again, and paying closer attention, and it still really struck me as bland and boring. It really just seems like these guys are trying to hard to be deep, when there really isn't anything there. The instrumentation is weak, the lyrics are weaker, and overall, it was a dissappointment. For now, 2/5 stars."
1,Put Me to Sleep Please!,"What are all you people thinking. This has to be the worst CD I have ever purchased. I bought the cd based on it's reviews, huge mistake. The idea of the album is cool don't get me wrong. But the lead singers voice sounds like it has been so computerized it makes me sick. How can you people compare this band to Pink Floyd or it's singer to Maynerd what a crock. I want my money back!!!!!!!"
5,I can't believe what this CD has done to my brain,"AMAZING!A week ago at this time I didn't know who this band is. Now I'm so addicted I'm listening to them all day long.This CD is my favorite so far. Their other stuff is really good too, but this CD has something else. Something I can't describe. It ate my brain in one big gulp."
5,Better than Leitmotif,"El Cielo breaks new ground for Dredg. The album is a great follow up to Leitmotif and a great improvement as well. The album is more musical, more dynamic, less repetitive, better mixed and more pleasing to the ear as well. The music just puts you in a great relaxed mood. I like to put it on and just sit and close my eyes. Its wonderful. Dredg uses a lot of great texture on this album with percussion, guitar tones, interesting bass lines and a lot of good string arrangements and even a little bit of saxophone work on ""Whoa is Me."" The album's closer is absolutely phenominal. The music is amazing and it provides a great climax to the album. ""The Canyon Behind Her"" concludes the album by tapering away from the intruments and fading into a simple but hypnotising choral line of changing chords. This album is one of my all time favorites. If you liked Leitmotif you will LOVE El Cielo."
5,More Flow than You Can Shake a Stick,"I can't express to you how much this changed my life. I happened to be having bouts of sleep apnea when I discovered this album, and it was so amazing. The structures and funky break downs in the midst of dreamlike melodies. The effects and sounds get deep into you, and take you somewhere completely else.The Canyon Behind Her: My favorite ending for an album."
5,Majestic,"Upon first listen, EL CIELO sounds much like an extension on LEITMOTIF, Dredg's debut album. But the beauty lies with the simplicity of this album. None of the songs are 10 minute progressive epics, but they are able to convey many emotions. ""Scissor Lock"" is nothing you've ever hear before. The production quality on this song is top notch. ""Of The Room"" is simply amazing with the moving chorus ""Night falls....."". Gavin Hayes's voice sounds very similar to Maynard of Tool's in this song, but not to the extent where he is a Maynard imposer. The musicianship in this album is of a high standard, and the lyrics are really beautiful, but also cryptic. If you like anything from Tool to Dead Can Dance to ,screw it. You like good music? You like Dredg."
3,It's no Leitmotif,"i have to say that as a HUGE fan of leitmotif, el cielo was a moderate disappointment. what made leitmotif so wonderful for me was the energy of tracks like 'symbol song' and 'crosswind minuet.' on el cielo you'll find more mellow tracks full of ""spiritual"" lyrics that border on cheesy (just give one listen to the 'all you need is a modest home in a modest neighborhood' section of 'same ol road'). it's still a good album, with some outstanding sing-along choruses, but it doesnt have the magical energy and rawness that made leitmotif such a triumph. if you're looking for a mouthful of sugar, this is the album for you."
5,A dynamic original record,"I don't quite recall how I stumbled upon this record, but I'm glad that I did. Apparently their first record was a bit heavier than ""El Cielo"" and the band was compared to Tool. I think a better starting point on this record would be the missing link between Radiohead and Porcupine Tree. There is definitely a progressive rock element here as well as washes of guitars the invoke shoegazer era britpop of the late 80's. The vocals are a bit unique, but once you get used to them this record becomes a very rewarding, fresh and dynamic journey."
5,Simply great,"An amazing album, that is perfect for almost every mood. I have been a fan of this band for many years and their major label release is far from a dissapointment. I hope they continue walking on the cutting edge and creating the kind of music I can truly enjoy."
4,Point of entry,"For those who haven't heard Dredg I offer a simple piece of advice: hear Dredg. As with all music, hearing is believing. Dredg manages to echo aspects of Tool, Miles Davis, early Pink Floyd, and other forms of progressive/art music while retaining a truly unique sound all their own. The drum sound on their albums is the heaviest yet most natural I've ever heard. The band doesn't multi-track everything to death (listen to the Smashing Pumpkins or Boston if you like that). Instead everything has room to breathe because art is about space. The msuic ranges from hard rock to piano ballads to indigenous vocal chants to psychedelic sound washes to free form jazz excursions AND sounds completely cohesive. Dredg is one of the best rock bands on the scene, period. If you crave art is music, and are tired of being fed ... pseudo-indie bands with trashy guitar tones this album may provide salvation. Turn it up loud for maximum effect. It will open your third eye."
3,El Cielo by Dredg,"This is album is not bad, but it's not as raw as their first album, Leitmotif, nor is it as polished and organized and conclusive as their last album, Catch Without Arms. I'm glad I now own it, but it's mostly out of closure, and not out of fulfillment from the music itself."
5,Wow!,"Again, wow! I discovered Dredg about 7 years ago. I purchased ""El Cielo"", and was amazed by the band and CD. I recently purchased the SACD of ""El Cielo"", and I must say it is like nothing I've ever heard. Music needs to be heard like this by more people. The surround mix is truly awe-inspiring. The drums sound like they are in the room with you. ""El Cielo"" has been one of my favorite albums for years now, but this SACD version gives it a whole new life to me. It is a masterpiece."
5,One of the most important pieces of music in recent history,"This album has opened doors for progressive music that no one could ever have dreamt possible; it is hard to fully explain how utterly beautiful and ethereal el cielo is until you have heard it. gavin's vocals are a huge part of the music, and this cd simply takes you to a place that is beautiful and terrible at the same time. it starts out with one of the best songs on the album, ""Same Ol'Road"", a cleansing, intelligent tune that will stick to you long after you have heard it. songs that stand out include: triangle, scissor lock, of the room, and whoa is me.this is just one of the most impressive albums that i have ever heard; buy it!"
5,Breathtaking,"Dredg has proved themselves worthy to combat with the chart topping bands that get overplayed on the radio. El Cielo is most likely the greatest cd I have ever listened to in my lifetime. The lead singer has one of the most beautiful voices I have ever heard for a modern ""Rock"" band; although I do no think that Dredg can fall under any category of music, they have their own. You will get your craving of hard guitar, but with the soothing sounds of perfect musical harmony. I can not explain the feeling that you get while listening to this cd, you are literally transported to some other place when listening to some of the songs on this cd.I think that anyone who does not at least give this cd a chance, has a problem. Absolutely breathtaking, I wont be suprised if they are #1 on the charts within the next 3-5 years."
1,not that worth.......,"General speaking, this book is well organised and written. However, I'd found the author doesn't face the actual problem on nowsday American Industry. Throughout the books, Great Americanism, or America is the best can always be found."
2,Incomplete Description,"I might think of buying a lampshade like this if there were more details posted. The product description available through the Amazon site is incomplete. All it says is ""fabric lamp shade, white"". But potential customers also need to know the size and how it mounts!"
1,How does this company stay in business?,"Look to their other products for more BAD reviews. Their customer support (NO PHONE # just e-mail or write them) to even ""unlock"" the features. It locks up my computer 90% of the time and they never respond. I need the MP3 unlocked to be able to send it to my phone, but they never send the activation code. Useless!! In case you are wondering if I am just some dolt that just learned how to turn on my computer -I am A+ and Network+ Certified. I know what I am doing and this and the rest of their product line is JUNK. Save your money!!"
5,High Class!,"What a fantastic CD! The most unique blend of jazz, cabaret and latin that I have EVER heard. And the singer's voice is truly amazing! A must have for dinner parties! I played it at mine and people were asking right and left who the band was?!"
2,Notable for What is NOT On This Album,"The music contained on this collection sounds great. Jackson Browne is without a doubt one of the best singer/songwriters of the 1970s/1980s. However, the fact that this disk does not contain ""Stay,"" ""That Girl Could Sing,"" ""Lawyers in Love,"" ""Boulevard,"" or ""Rock Me on the Water"" makes for an overall dissapointing experience. When I listen to this disk I can't help but wonder why these songs were not included. If they had been this would have been one of the best ""Best Of"" albums ever. Instead, it is just OK..."
2,Could have been so much better,"This CD does not live up to its potential. The sound quality of the CD is flat. And the omission of ""The Load-Out \ Stay"" is inexcusable."
2,Gimme a Break,"How can this be called the Best of Jackson Browne? It doesn't include many of his great songs. Every time I think about buying this CD I stop. There's way too much missing. My advice to anyone wanting to get some Jackson Browne into their collection is to look elsewhere. Start with one of the stand alone albums. ""Saturate Before Using,"" ""The Pretender,"" and ""Running on Empty"" are my favorites. I have different advice for the record company: Get your act together and release a true ""Best of"" for Browne. Sure, it will probably need to be a double-disc set. Also, it would be nice to see some remastered versions of the individual albums. As far as I know, we're still forced to put up with [poor] sounding analog transfers of all the early albums, which are easily his best."
2,waste of money,"This CD is a waste of money for any but the most casual fans. A best of compilation would need to be a double disc set and would have to include such songs as ""The Road"" from RUNNING ON EMPTY, ""Before the Deluge"" from LATE FOR THE SKY, and two or three additional tracks from FOR EVERYMAN. Really, his first five albums merit owning in their entirety, even for non-fanatics. A single best-of CD that covers his later career (from HOLD OUT onward) would be welcome, as the albums are much more spotty, but this CD fails to document even his more recent stuff adequately. The choices are so strange in some cases that this CD can't even be considered representative.That being said, compeletist may have to buy this CD anyway for the title track and ""The Rebel Jesus,"" which appears on a Chieftains album, I think in a different form. ""Somebody's Baby"" is only available on the ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"" soundtrack and was a Top 40 hit in 1981 or so."
4,Interesting Collection,"This compilation of Browne's career is ok, but there is a lot of material missing that could have been included. In fact a more recent two CD retrospective was released a few years ago that covers a lot more ground than this disc does. The choices of songs selected for this album are not necessarily Browne's ""greatest hits"" although several of his big ones are included (""Doctor My Eyes"", ""Running On Empty"", ""Tender Is The Night"", ""Lives In The Balance""). The collection includes one track from each of his studio albums so some of his better album tracks are included here as well (""Late For The Sky"", ""Barricades Of Heaven""). The album also includes two new recordings ""The Rebel Jesus"" and ""The Next Voice You Hear"" both of which are good. All in all this is a good collection, but might disappoint those just looking for Browne's hits."
2,Best of - NOT!,"I gotta agree with many of the posts. This is a very poorly put together Best of Collection. Best of Collections are not for the long time die hard fans. They have all the albums. Best of Collections are for those who like the music, but don't want to invest in all of the albums. Maybe we will be inspired to delve further into an artist's history after listening to a Best of Collection.I was waiting for years for a JB Best of Collection. I bought this album with the hopes of getting all or most of Jackson Browne's hits. This doesn't even come close. So many big hits or popular songs are absent. Check out a greatest hits album from Springsteen, Petty, Mellancamp. These are best of/greatest hits collections.When the next best of or greatest hits comes out, I won't be buying."
3,Hope to hear another voice soon...,"As mentioned in some of the other reviews here, this ""best of"" collection is strangely bereft of some of Browne's biggest hits and most frequently played classic rock staples. Among the missing are Here Come Those Tears Again, Boulevard, Rock Me on the Water, That Girl Could Sing, Stay, and Lawyers in Love. The good news is that the old songs included here are gems (Late for the Sky, Fountain of Sorrow) and sound fantastic. Still, I can't listen to this collection without thinking of the collection that could have, and should have, been."
3,Same mistake as the Boss and Seger,"While there are some great cuts on this CD,such as the Pretender and Shape of a heart,there are also some glaring ommissions. Jackson Browne and or his record company has made the same mistake as Springsteens and Segers. The mistake is trying to put a ""best of package"" on one CD.While I applaud the effort to put out a greatest hits without having to purchase a box set, I think all three of these artists would have been much better served with a two CD set."
2,Browne Falls Short,"Make no mistake about it. This is a ""Best Of"" album (apparently as selected by Browne) ... not a ""Greatest Hits"" albums.If you're not sure what the difference is, take a look at the track list. Notice anything missing?Like many people who admire Browne's work but don't run to the record store (or to the computer) everytime he puts out a new release, I've always hoped he'd deliver a knock-out greatest hits album.To say that the quality of the track selection on this album is wafer thin is an insult to wafer makers around the world.A major disappoinment."
4,A delightfully melancholy journey,"This ""best of"" album nicely showcases Browne's progression through the years, from his highly personal early work through his more outwardly focused and often political music. Overall, I enjoyed the album, because the song choices often coincided with my favorites from particular albums. For example, ""Sky Blue and Black"" and ""The Barricades of Heaven"" are the two best from their respective albums. It is a shame, though, that music does not seem to have been chosen this way consistently; some, like ""Running on Empty"" and ""Somebody's Baby"" (while, granted, good songs) seem to have been included more for recognizability than artistry and stick out oddly among the more pensive-sounding tunes that populate this recording. One caveat: Jackson's best work is excellent, but often his best work is also wrenchingly melancholy. This makes it hard to sit down and listen to ""The Next Voice You Hear"" at a stretch without sinking into a deep melancholia yourself. Be warned!"
3,Where the TUNES!,How can this be a greatest hits album with out the songs Stay-You love the thunder-Here comes those tears again. I'm a big Jackson Browne fan but to exclude those songs is crazy. I personnally won't be purchasing this CD because of the exclusion of these songs.AHHHHHHHHHHHH!
5,Excellent,"I loved this C.D. Have waited a long time for Jackson's greatest hits. Especially enjoyed ""Sky Blue and Black"" and ""Barricades of Heaven"" as they return to the ""story of his life"" versus his political statements found in some of his later songs. Jackson looks and sounds as good as he did in 1972! Glad to see from the insert that David Lindley is still a force in Jackson's career too!"
2,An Uncompromising Artist Compromises Here,"It must be a real challenge to put out a dud of greatest hits album when you have as many truly great songs to your credit as Browne. It's a challenge, however, that he and the record company were apparently up to.The choice of cuts on this compilation is poor and woefully incomplete and the sequencing of the songs is downright disorienting.Browne is a sensational musician. This album should have been a good way to introduce new listeners to his uncompromising style. Instead its a remarkably compromised effort."
4,No problems with it.,It shipped on time and works well. The only problem that I can say bout it is that the picture is different then what's given. I don't think there's anything else to say about it. :P
5,Card Holders,"I love these. I use them to hold notes or whatever, to use in my purse: for car registration, medicines I take, little lists. This way I can always find them & they don't get all wrinkled up. Many ways to use them."
2,Not what's shown.,The picture shows regular toploaders with sleeves. The description says they're the premium.. but I didn't notice the difference. I thought I was buying what was pictured. (really what's the point of showing a pic of something when you're selling something else??) But I got the premium ones without sleeves instead of the regular with sleeves that I wanted. Not cool.
1,No driver for Pocket PC 2003,"Although the product looks OK and I guess it should work OK, I haven't been able to make it work yet as Belkin has no driver for Pocket PC 2003 yet ! When I contacted the technical support, they said that they had no date for release of a compatible driver !!Better purchase another bluetooth adapter if you are running Pocket PC 2003."
3,"Pocket PC 2003 drivers are available, but...","Yes, the driver and registry update are available for 2003 even though the company that wrote them no longer exists. I have this card working on my Dell Axim X5. It works with my GPS receiver and my laptop. But as has been noted, Dial-Up Networking does not work. [...]"
5,Belkin F8T020 BT PDA CF Card works with PocketPC 2003,This card works well and drivers ARE available for PocketPC 2003 - we sell many of these cards and have had few complaints.Dell sells this same card as the TrueMobile 300.
1,PPC2003 Driver for Belkin BT CF Adapter,"I use a driver downloaded from Dell or Philips. It works fine, only is unable to establish bluetooth dial up modem connection."
1,Garbage,I have owned the Bixolon SRP-275 printer for 7-months and have never gotten it to print more than 2-times in any given setting. Connected to my Business Edition Dell Latitude D830 traveling between home and trade shows this printer always needs to be reinstalled and hardly ever works and you can't get any support from the company. I would suggest buying anything except Bixolon printers.
4,intergallactic beats,"Mix master mike has really worked on his beats this time. i give him props for that. what i miss is like a scratch-theme in each track like dj revolution, dj premier are doing using acapellas and making own lyrics, sentences with it.Overall the album is ok, but not a classic."
1,Do not buy from here,"Once i got the book and opened it up I found that the book was ripped almost in half, after flipping through more pages I found what I thought was snot all over multiple pages throughout the book. I'm giving the book one stars due to the fact of it was in horrible shape when I got it and also the book is ok but just on the book I would give it 3 out of 5 stars."
4,Great impact.,"As a foreign correspondent, Scott Peterson witnessed firsthand Somalia's descent into war, the spiritual degeneration of Sudan's Holy War, and the genocide in Rwanda. He brings these events together to record a collapse that has had an impact far beyond African borders."
4,"Good start, implausible ending","It was hard to put this book down, a good mystery about a small town gone bad. The only complaint I have about this book is the ending was a bit unbelievable."
2,"I prefer more thrill, less emotional drama...","This is why I usually stay away from female authors. I really felt like there was way too much emotion and not enough good story here. The story itself is a good one, with some good parts that are thrilling. However too much time is spent with drama filled pages of emotional feeling, that could only be written by a woman. And the book didn't seem to flow - too many short sentences one right after another. Maybe the author has better writing skills that she didn't represent in this book but I know I was happy to be finished with it and on to something I could really get in to."
4,Silence is not always golden!,"Avery Chauvin is an investigative reporter who goes home to smalltown Louisiana to attend to the affairs of her father after his death. While there, she is welcomed back by her ex-boyfriend and his family who have chosen to stay in this ""Pleasantville-like"" town where things appear to be perfect. After finding out about an unusual number of accidental deaths and disappearances, Avery decides to stay for awhile, looking into the situations surrounding the town.This is a pretty good yarn with some surprises at the end."
5,"Chilling, and Deceptive","I just finished this book yesterday, and I was so pleased. This book was alot like Erica, but she wove a totally different kind of story. This book may be my new favorite instead of All Fall Down. I cannot wait for her new book to come out!!!!"
4,Great Thriller,"This is a great thriller, with lots of plot twists. This writer keeps getting better and better. This plot involves alot of psychology, not just of the predator but everyone involved with the story. Fast paced and an exciting end. Highly recommend."
2,In Silence,"In Silence is a formula murder mystery which is not necessarily a bad thing. The story line might have been extremely interesting, but I found myself distracted and annoyed by an over-abundance of run-on sentences, sentence fragments, unclear pronoun references, and other mechanical errors. In Silence was my first and last Spindler novel."
4,Creepy homecoming,"This is a great book from Erica Spindler. It has twists and turns on every page of drama and intrigue. You'll be at the edge of your seat. A great thriller! When Avery learns her father committed suicide, she's shocked to hear it. As a journalist, Avery returns to her home in Cypress Springs, Louisiana, and tries to put together the pieces of what happened. She later learns, that he set his house in life. Also, strange things have been happening, even when she's reunited with her former flame, Hunter Stevens, and meets his family, which have been acting strange. And when she digs deeper, she's in the line of fire of a vigilante group who wants to punish people, and vows to never go home again."
5,Edgey,"I was introduced to ES by my girlfriend. I had never read her work, much less, heard of her. Once I started reading it was hard to put the book down. I have now read four of her books (reading #5 now. In Silence kept me guessing between the brothers and at one point, the dad. Needless to say, it kept me on edge trying to figure how it would end and who would be the bad guy, and in this case the sick pervert...Good to the last page!"
3,Fuel line quick disconnect,"These plastic quick disconnects work most of the time but I would spend the extra couple bucks on and alloy tool, they work much better."
2,"You *DO* realize this has nothing to do with Ellen DeGeneres, right?","Saw this at Wal-Mart one day, and picked it up for my S.O., who's a fan of Ellen (DeGeneres). Over the weekend, we started listening to it, and noticed that these were *not* the original recordings of these popular songs, rather, they were performed by ""The Hit Crew"". Furthermore, as we studied the liner notes in more detail, we realized that aside from the name ""Ellen"", there seems to be no discernible connection between this, and daytime talk-show hostess Ellen DeGeneres.We got a chuckle out of it all, and the CD was only $6 or so. But it's still dishonesty on the part of the marketers. Now I'm off to go watch ""Transmorphers""."
1,Empty.,"I loved Pollen and enjoyed Vurt, thought Automated Alice was fairly competant if a little uninspiring. I only finished Nymphomation because I'd shelled out for it. I found the writing style virtually unreadable in places; trying to be so cool that it utterly failed to convey any meaning or emotion. Perhaps this was the intention of the author. I have nothing against style over content, but feel in this case that the style was haphazzard and resulted in a total lack of any empathy with the characters (which was definitely there in earlier works by this author). Ultimately vacuous."
3,Third Edition,I have the second edition of this New Bible commentary which I was pleased with but it was falling apart. So I ordered this third edition. I was very disappointed as it had fell for the documentary theory and the quality of the commentary and introductions to the books of the Bible had fallen from the second edition. So I'm still using the one that is falling apart.exp
5,Snow and Hot Chocolate,"Snow . . . lots of pristine powdery substance: good for making snowmans, skiing, snowmobiling, and I would have liked to have gone sledding.Hot chocolate, hot apple cider, a cozy bookstore, and a cozy condo to go along with all that snow. Good thing I read this book in the scorching heat in the South, or I would have wanted hot chocolate. But it ""mentally"" sounded good, though not physically. I do not want hot chocolate in this heat!Kate, who lives in Texas, goes to Colorado to stay in her aunt's condo for Winter Break. How awesome is that! She brings her two best friends.This is a teen romance, and I do admit that I do not like romance novels, but I liked this book because of the atmosphere and all the cozy things I mentioned.And, by the way, ""Thrill Ride"", also by Rachel Hawthorne, is also an awesome teen book. I liked it even more."
3,Love on the lifts,Great bookAbout teens and college kids and relationships. Siblings can bond after all. Nice to see how relationships turn when you think you like someone else.
5,Adorable!,"This book is a little corny, but we could definitely all use a little corny in our lives. Worth the time to read!"
3,"Good read, but boring","I found the plot ordinary. I really expected more of it. I also think that the novel should have a little bit of adventure, maybe something different from all the other teen romantic novels. But, I can't argue that I enjoyed Joe (the male protagonist)."
3,A cute teen romance,"This is a really fun, light read. It focuses on a bunch of teenagers hanging out on a winter vacation. What's not to love? The main couple was cute, although it was a little obvious for my taste, which is why I deducted stars. I would (and have) recommended this book to friends. In fact, my copy is on loan to my best friend right now."
3,"Nice to read, but not as good as you think","""Love on the Lifts"" is a great book, especially for teens, but not as fun and enjoyable as you would hope."
4,Try to get a better price,"I like it, but it isn't all that thick- I would try to obtain it in the 15-20 dollar range if you can. There are enough specifics to make it worthwhile but I am sure you would feel better about owning it if you extract a better price than I did (around $30 not counting shipping and handling.) They didn't have this at my library and I was curious."
5,Highly recommended for lawyers and paralegals everywhere,"Now in a thoroughly updated second edition, The Lawyer's Guide To Marketing on the Internet is a practical introduction to getting the most out of the Internet, and collaboratively written by Gregory H. Siskind, Deborah McMurray, Richard P. Klau for professional attorneys. Individual chapters address designing a professional web site, ethical issues online, developing an internet marketing plan, optimum use of e-mail, and a great deal more. Highly recommended for lawyers and paralegals everywhere, The Lawyer's Guide To Marketing On The Internet is an indispensable guide for making the most out of internet opportunities as affecting the development of a successful legal practice."
1,none yet,i have not been able to read the book as such i would not be in a position to review the book
4,Not intended as toy for toddler,It seems like nice quality. My 3 year old and 20 month old broke the red reed off in a week. My wife superglued it back on and it seems to be working fine. My three year old loves it. Update I have been informed that this is not intended to be a toy for a small child. So I'm bumping up my review to 4 just cuz.
1,The Family Stand just broke!,"I purchased the Family Stand's first two albums only because I was familiar with their work with Paula Abdul. I bought and thought their first two albums were satisfactory listening but their third album was so terrible, I returned it to the store the same day and demanded my money back. The album just didn't hold me. The words have no meaning and the rythms and chords seem to change drastically from one verse to the next that it's too jumpy to enjoy. I expected better from this group, but it's no wonder why you can't find their music hardly at all in the stores. It's just not good enough to sell."
3,Good book for begginers,"This is one of many good books on the subject useful for those getting started in the field. I like the jounalistic style approach to the author's work, and the layout of the book is well done. A lot of good ideas for what to capture during the wedding day. What I think is sorely missing is that author offer more detail advice about what digital equipment one should get to help carry out the work. He provides a brief introduction to the type of cameras on the market (from point and shoot to professional), but he doesn't seem to go any further than that. Information about lenses, flash units, etc would be very useful. Also could have conluded a section on lighting."
5,"This book is excellent,, except for......","This book is excellent, except for the size of the print. The print is terrible. It is real, real, real, small print. I can't understand why the publisher would ruin a great book like this by making the print so small. No offense to you, Mr. Gero. You are an excellent photographer. Your pictures are great. This book is so well written. Thank you so much for sharing your experience and knowledge with us. My hat is off to you, sir. If you come out with a second edition, please tell the publisher you want bigger print, much bigger print. Or, if you have this book on a CD or DVD, please let me know. I would gladly pay more for a book of this quality, in order to pay for the extra pages it would take to print the book in a lot larger print. For some reason, almost all photography books are written in print that is way to small. Are you listening publisher's? Please, publisher's, we DO NOT want tiny print in our photography books."
4,It's okay,"This book is okay for an introduction to digital wedding photography. I recommend this book for people who understand the basic concepts of photography and are looking for a guide to shooting weddings. People who need to learn the basics of photography should get a different book. Also, people who are familar with wedding photography and want a book that provides new ideas for exposure, compostion, posing, and general artistic ideas also should get a different book. This book is a good basic guide to wedding photography, and I recommend this book only for people who want just that."
2,Offers too little,This book is useful only if you're really inexperienced in photography and particularly wedding photography. It also suffers from a serios lack of content.
4,HP 28 Tri-color Ink Cartridge,"I like this product, which was really getting to be hard for me to find in my area. It was in the factory packaging as stated and works perfectly in my printer....if asked I would recommend it for purchase."
4,A good summer book,"There used to be a pdf file of this book circulating before it was published. I'm glad an editor finally picked it up.It's a great story, or set of stories, and the short stand-alone chapter format makes it easy to pick up and quite addictive.The characterisations are strong and the reader gets involved and concerned for the main character. The climactic end is the most amazing surprise.The writing is much better than we are used to putting up with from gay authors and my guess is that the straight world will enjoy the voyeuristic access to hidden aspects of the gay dating game.All in all, I think this is the perfect summer books to dip in and out of when you're on the beach and although I don't often read things over, I intend to order a proper copy for myself and read it again."
4,50 vignettes of unrequited gay love,Certainly not your average gay novel. This series of 50 encounters of our hero and the reason why the relations he describes are certainly not escapist gay fiction but more like the gritty reality of gay life as it affects many people. Set over several decades and a series of you guessed it 50 failed relationships wryly amusing and sad at the same time. A good read.
2,Ok. Multicultural book- but white bread,"This is a good multicultural book to read, but it's too PC. It as if the book was an episodic show allready on one of the big 3 Tv. networks.""The Big Book of Jerkcity"" , ISBN 0966331184, is multicultural too, but far more funnier and edgier."
5,One of the better books out there,"In addition to Stones' ""Stick Control"", ""Accents and Rebounds"" is a great book. Not only for beginners, but for the advanced players as well.Making the Line: A how-to guide on successfully auditioning for drumlines."
3,Wrigley Field high above sea-level? Dude!,"There is some good information in this book, and some good pictures, but there are a number of inaccuracies that are disturbing (I take my ballpark history seriously). Consider the description of Wrigley Field as ""high above sea level"" and how that affects the ball flight. Dude, last time I looked, 600 feet is not high above sea level...maybe you meant the ballpark in Denver. Again, that is just ONE of the misleading inaccuracies. This is a good book, but not for serious ballpark afficionados like myself."
4,baseball parks,"Take me out to the ballpark by Josh Leventhal is a very exciting book because it shows you baseball's old stadiums. For instance, the Brooklyn Dodgers Stadium. The book shows you how many stadiums there are. I used to think there were only 30 stadiums, but this book gives information on more than 100 major and minor league stadiums around the country.The book shows some very unique stadiums. Some have roofs, some do not and some are football stadiums like Minnesota's stadium. My favorite part of the book is when they show you the old Yankee Stadium. I think a baseball fan should read this book.By Jacob"
5,One of the best,This book on baseball parks was incredibly good. I personally am very interested in baseball parks and so I have high expectations for a book like this. The information was given in an easy-to-read way that made reading it enjoyable and not a chore. There were lots of facts and the pictures were perfect. The only problem was the shape... I don't get it is it a baseball or what? Other than that this is one of the best baseball books there is and I should know because I love baseball.P.S. Go Rangers
3,Take Me Out to the Ballpark is a disappointment,"This could have been such an enjoyable book had the author/editor prevented the internet-style graphics and stats from crowding (and often covering) the beautiful photographs of the ballparks. I don't care how many home runs were hit in Camden Yards and I especially don't care to see a bright red pennant with ""home runs!"" stats overlaying the photograph. The book would have been effective if all the photographs were more like those on the first few pages, where we see unfettered, whole-page sized shots of a minor league park and Braves Field in Boston. The information about the parks, which is interesting, then could have been included on opposite pages. Instead, the creatively shaped book, great photographs and useful information are all diminished by combining them into a visual mess.Look at it in the bookstore but don't buy it."
4,"Fine, Representative Collection","Judy Collins is one of the great artists and this strong collection goes quite some way towards doing her justice. No real surpises here, apart from how well the early material stands up: ""Maid of Constant Sorrow"", ""So Early, Early in the Spring"" and the irresistible ""Someday Soon"" are far from overshadowed by the big hits ""Send in the Clowns"" and ""Amazing Grace"", both undeniably classic interpretations. Judy's own compositions ""My Father"" and ""Albatross"" are welcome inclusions, as is the profoundly touching song about her son ""Born to the Breed"". The only tracks I have trouble with are ""Pirate Jenny"" and ""Marat Sade"" - on both of these Judy seems to be trying too hard to impress; I much prefer when she sticks to the simpler folk formats. Like other reviewers, I would have liked to have ""I Think its Going to Rain Today"" included, but these are minor criticisms - overall this is a very worthwhile overview."
5,An Angel for our needy world,"In the early 60's, I was a snobby and probably snotty ""just-out-of Medical School"" Republican. Then, one night in Denvr, Co;orado I walked into a Coffee House; and my life changed. Judy Collins was playing and singing. Since then, she has been my mentor of right vs. wrong, human ethics and caring about our planet. I believe I own every recording she has made.This anthology collects the very best examples of her extraordinary talent and voice. In two CD's one can here the vintage Judy nd the mature, the folk ballads, the anti-war beliefs and her personal autobiographical songs. Buy this; you willsmile, dream and yes, even cry. This is a musical classic, an experience for all generations and lovers of beauty."
2,Someone needed to take this thing in hand,"Much of the music is lovely, though the track sequencing doesn't show any organizing principle. The cover photo is silly, and a little sad. What is Judy trying to prove? And to whom is she trying to prove it -- us or herself?But what's really distressing are the booklet notes -- by Gloria Steinem (some inconsequential reminiscences about her days as a folkie college student) and particularly those by Collins herself, who can't write her way out of a paper bag. I was very disappointed to learn that there is such a rambling, vapid intellect behind that lovely voice.Judy Collins just had too much control over this project. She should have exercised a little less ego and a little more judgment by letting someone else hold the reins."
2,No Sunny Goodge Street?,How can you possibly have the best of the best of Judy Collins and not include Sunny Goodge Street? No Thursday all-nighter in '76 was complete without Sunny Goodge Street and this best of anthology is not complete without it either.
5,Excellent Collection from an Excellent Artist!,"""Forever"" is an excellent collection of Judy Collins premium years with Elektra Records. Although not chronologically sequenced, this collection speaks multitudes about an enduringly treasured and highly regarded American artist. Whether singing her own compositions or those songs from her impeccable taste in other songwriters repertoire, ""Forever"" shines as a musical monument---Illuminating the career of a truly original and ""one of a kind"" voice. If you're a Collins fan you will also love the well written and insightful liner notes. I highly recommend this great collection. Awesome cover photo!"
4,Logitech MOMO Force Feedback Racinf wheel,"Excellent use of wheel in tight curves, no swaying like the old wheels. Having the shifter beside the wheel as well as the control paddles and buttons makes this a top line Sterring Wheel . The only draw back is the lack of instruction showing you how to remove the top centre consol to gain access to the two top screws to attach the wheel to your Desk. Wheel works in all games, but make sure that it is set up in the windows program. This is a must"
3,mo mo wheel,"I thought the wheel is good, I may have to slow of a connection to get it to work right. New at these pc games..... just ok I guess"
4,I really enjoy my wheel,"I have really enjoyed my wheel. I wish there were a few more buttons on it, but for the money it is great."
5,nice wheel,"very nice racing wheel. it has worked with all of the racing games i have tried so far, including gran turismo on the ps3. the steering, shifting, braking and gas are very precise and adjustable. good compromise between the cheap wheels and the all out expensive wheels."
5,wheel great deal,My son loves this product. It's working great and is a hundred times better than using the keyboard for steering. It was cheeper here than from Best Buy
3,Logitech Momo,I am concerned about the controls. There seems to be inconsistent throttle control during racing games.
3,Problems with the power adapter plug,"Mine will not work. Apparently there is a problem with the power adapter or the plug. Many others complain about this same problem. It seems that Logitech has quality issues at their manufacturing plant. I hope they get it sorted out, because there are not many other force-feedback wheels on the market."
1,Additional Feedback,I have now taken back 2 Logitech MOMO Driver steering wheels. Had to take the current one back this week as the left gear paddle ceased working.There is a major design flaw with the gear paddles and for this reason i believe Logitech should recall this product and fix this problem. An online team member also had the same problem with this wheel. One of his paddles stopped working after one week of use.Everything else about this wheel is excellent and perhaps you will be fortunate and not have the problem i have had. Also if you drive Auto or are comfortable using the stick shifter this also negates the paddle vulnerability being an issue.
5,Great wheel for the price,"The MOMO Racing wheel has good force feedback effects, much better than previous wheels i've used. It uses gears to create the effects so some rattling is experienced, but not enough to discourage playing. Software is great in assisting with customizing buttons for all types of racing games. Rubber wheel makes it very easy to hold on during intense steering with stick shifter and paddles being great additions. Recommended buy."
5,"Great product, perfect for budget sim racers","Sure we would all like to have a BRD or TSW, but this is the best bang for the buck of any wheel out there. Matches perfectly with all the current sims, including rFactor (a MUST have, rfactor.net), GTR, GTL, RBS and the venerable GPL. Great wheel feel with limited slip, sequential shifter works nicely as the e-brake for RBR and the multiple buttons and assignable pedal axis make this perfect for all applications. Highly recommended."
1,Don't buy !!!!!,"I bought this hoping for some real racing fun. What I got was dissapointment however. Steering wheel never centered correctly.Downloaded multiple tweak files from various websites that said it would correct problem but didn't. Steering sensativity was never the same on different games even though settings were the same.Example: say your racing Need For Speed Hot Pursuit 2 and you win your race and move on to another race in a championship series. The resistence on the race you just won is set to ""0"" and it's real easy to turn on that race. The next race is totally different though. Even though settings are the same the resistence is like going from power steering to manual steering on an old truck. Then came the real bad problem. Throttle kept messing up and then it would only go 1/2 throttle no matter what game I played or what the setting's were. On top of that Amazon only gave me partial credit when I returned in ""as recieved"" condition."
3,not bad,the dealer fogot to update the picture of the item. I received very different thing from the picture I have seen. But they depreciated for me. That's a good result.
2,No subtitles !,"Well this may very well be a sendup of gangster films, but I'll never know the whole of it - there are no subtitles ! Shame on me for not electing to study French in high school/college !There should be a listing of this dvd's features, and Amazon LLC sold it ! And I should have checked more thoroughly on this Gaumont release.This refers to this specific version of this title -amazon.com/tontons-flingueurs-Ventura-French-version/dp/B002MD2Z10/ref=sr_1_1?s=movies-tv&ie;=UTF8&qid;=1345514032&sr;=1-1&keywords;=Les+tontons+flingueurs"
5,All That,"This was my first Nikki Turner novel, and I couldn't put it down. If you like urban novels, don't miss thia one. It's absolutely great. Looking for Hustler's Wife now!"
3,Can you say EDITOR?,"I gave this book 3 stars because I didn't want to come down too hard on Ms. Turner. But, please let me say this that book was no good. Did that just make sense? Well, those are the kinds of errors you run into while reading A Project Chick. The story was interesting. But in some parts VERY UNBELIEVABLE. I'm an advid reader of Black Fiction that flows with drama falling in the right place not all over the place! You want a good read? Try Bad Girlz by Shannon Holmes, The Last Bad Decision by Paula Edwards, or my personal favorite, Black by Tracy Brown. I would recommend these novels to anyone. As for A Project Chick, you better have plenty of patience before reading it. That's all for now folks. Peace."
2,A load of unrealistic rubbish!,"I was recommended this book and at first I like it; maybe the first chapter or so..interesting content and good opening, but then it got ridiculous; she made several errors, skipped through time in a short number of pages- I didn't know where it was going one minute it's the next day then 10 years later! Also it was very unrealistic in terms of what happened and she stooped as low as to advertise her own book smh!"
2,NIKKI TURNER JUST MADE HER FIRST BAD BOOK!,"I couldn't believe this, one of my favorite writers Nikki Turner made a bad book! No, no, say it isn't so. I could have excepted this from another writer but not her. I read this book and it was so up and down to me. I just wasn't feelin' it. I'm so upset, maybe others will love it, but to me it wasn't that good."
3,TOO MANY ERRORS,"I would first like to say that I liked this book very much, and I have already recommended it to friends. But, I have to ask Ms. Turner not to insult me again with her constant typos and numerous errors. I became very annoyed with that alone. Then there is the fact that she herself became confused and mixed the characters up Gypsy and Wiggles. But what annoyed me the most was when I was thinking back on the book and discovered a horrific error. Now pay attention, How can Lil Merk be Tajs' son when he was in Jail when Lil Merk was concieved. Lil Merk is the youngest child, Pee is the second and the old head is father to the first. Maybe its me but Iam confused. Nikki, please FIRE your editors they played you and as a result you played me. I also feel that she could have gave Indie and Tressa a little more of a story line. The endding was only ok."
2,Smith in DC,"I won't deny that this book has a good story line, but it's time-consuming to read and reread over and over and over, paragraphs and sentences that just don't make sense. Nicki Turner should fire Triple Crown Publishing for the mess they've made of her book."
2,Not a favorite,"This book was sort of slow to me. It also had a lot, and I do mean lots of grammer and spelling errors. At one time she was telling Gypsy after she became paralized that ""she was going to get custody of her nephew if the police ever caught up to her brother, she then said Wiggles just blew into the straw to agree"". Wiggles had been killed 4 chapters back. These are the types of errors that occured all through the book, which is why it was so difficult to read. I am not sure if I will read any other Nikki Turner books anytime soon (hopefully she has a better editor now). This book was overall a slow read, and in no way can compete to other african american authors like, Zane, Michael Baisden, Eric Jerome Dickey or Sister Souljah for that matter. My recommendation is to read at your own risk, its better to check it out at the local library for free, then to spend $10-$15 dollars on it at the store. :)"
4,Good vs. Bad,"Well, let's start with the good. It was a pretty good book that most people, men and women alike, could relate to. There is a little bit of every personality in this book, and that makes it so easy for everyone to relate to it; you can see where everyone is coming from. However, there were far too many typos and inconsistencies throughout the story. Whoever edited this book did not do a very good job, and for $14.95 retail, I expected a little more professionalism from Triple Crown. That is the biggest drawback. But once you get past that, the book is excellent."
2,"good book , but not a page turner","this book was good, it was a great ending and it kept me interested (well...for the most part). however, i felt it was unrealistic how things happened to her, like getting a place in only a week just by flirting and looking good (being raised with Section 8, i can tell you, if it was as simple as it was in this book, EVERYBODY would be on it fast) how things happened with Indie, how she got from the projects to a house (just from knowing somebody), and how, after only a couple of months, Wiggles COMPLETLEY cleans up, get a job and have morals again. now maybe Cleveland crackheads are different from VA crackheads (which is sarcasim, a crackhead is a crackhead no matter where) but they don't clean up mentally, emotionally and financially that damn quick. and i also thought the book wasn't consistent enough. it jumped from one year to the next in a matter or sentences. i thought it could've had a better flow and more realism. but all in all, it was worth reading."
3,What in the world?!?,"Nikki Turner is not a trained writer, but she doesn't need to be one. All she's supposed to do is write the book. Her editors are the ones that are supposed to make the piece a sound literary work. I'm a high school English teacher, and I wanted to get my red pen while I read this novel! The editing was horrible! The grammar was off, and the point of view switched from 1st to 3rd like it was nothing! Ignoring the bad editing, Nikki Turner did a great job telling this heartfelt tale of a young single mother, ""doin' what she had to do for her children."""
1,What's up with the editing?,I love the stories Nikki Turner writes but what's up with the editing. I feel like I need to have a red pen in my hand to read these triple crown books. (Vickie Stringer and Shannon Holmes should be ashamed of themselves for putting this stuff out. My hats off to Terri Woods and Carl Weber now they put out street books that black people can be proud of. Nikki find a new publisher cause I can't take it anymore. I had to put this one down before I finished.
4,KUDOS TO OUR GIRL NIKKI T!!!! A PROJECT CHICK REVIEW,"This is my first online review given and I must say that Ms. Nikki Turner is a truly gifted writer!! I have recommended this book to two other co-workers and they have/are enjoying it as well.My only negative comment is that there are several typographical errors (the reason for the 4-star rating) I wish that I hadn't purchased a book with so many, but I fault the editor for this. For anyone looking for page-turning books, both of Nikki Turner's will do it. I enjoyed a Hustler's Wife and loved every minute of A Project Chick. You will not be disappointed!!To Ms. Turner:Please keep doing your thing as you are truly talented!! :-)"
2,Aww Mannnnn,"See if you read Ms. Turner's previous work you would know where I'm coming from. ""Hustler's Wife"" is a great book but this one well.......let me explain. For thoese who read hear me out and for thoes who haven't listen to me realll good ok. I thought this was a repeat of or copy of ""Hustler's Wife"" the main haracter Lucky Luck seem to be bengie all over again, Gloria from H.W seem to be or show some simalrities in ""wiggles"" from P.C, Yarni was Teresa, I forgot his name but Teresa's brother was Des from H.W all in all the books were two much alike and didn't show any uniquenesss. Also Triple Crown Productions was and still is doing the damn thang but what's up with the editing even the slang was wrong and words were flip around. It's one thing to read the book and figure out what going on but to be confused because of the misspelled words come on now."
2,WHAT THE F**K !!!!!,THIS BOOK SUCKED COMPARED TO HER OTHER BOOKS... I DID NOT LIKE THIS ONE AT ALL IT TOOK ME SO LONG TO READ IT !!! I WONDER DID SHE READ THIS HORRIBLE BOOK.... WHATS WRONG NIKKI??????? USUALLY HER WORK IS AWESOME BUT I DONT KO WHAT HAPPEND HERE..... DO NOT BUY...!!!!!!
2,What happened?,"I did not connect with ""A Project Chick"" at all. It was extremely over the top in most scenes which made the novel very unbelievable. The book did not flow and that could be contributed to the many grammatical, spelling, and punctuation errors. The consistency is by far less than tolerable, I felt as if Ms. Turner was ""dumbing it down"" for her audience. I must say the ending was nice and a surprise, but was completely rushed. The main reasons I continued reading this novel was based on entertainment and because I don't like to start a book and let it go unfinished."
2,Save Your Time and Energy!!,"DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY. This book contains many grammatical errors and you'll find yourself trying to make sense out of what you've read. I've tried to get pass all of the errors, but enough is enough. I encourage the author to invest in an experienced Editor."
1,Disappointing!!,"I had high hopes after reading ""A Hustler's Wife"" only to be disappointed with ""A Project Chick"". First let me say that I know Ms. Turner is capable of better judging by the first book. This one seemed a little rushed and out of step. The errors in the book were ridiculus. I'm sure Spell-Check was on the computer, I don't know why she didn't use it.I hate to ever say this but....Don't buy it."
2,I WAS PISSED,THIS BOOK HAD TO BE THE FAKEST BOOK THAT I HAVE EVER READ. I WAS NOT FEELING TRESSA AT ALL. AND I HAVE TO SAY THAT IT IS APBOLUTELY A WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY. I EXPECTED IT TO BE GOOD BUT IT REALLY DON'T DESERVE THE TWO STARS I GAVE IT. ALL THE STUFF THAT HAPPENED IN THIS BOOK WAS STRAIGHT UP UNREAL. WHAT KIND OF GHETTO WAS SHE TRYING TO IMATATE IT SHOULD AIN'T THE HOOD I WAS RAISED IN. IT JUST WASN'T REALISTIC THESE BOOKS ARE SUPPOSED TO BE BASED OF OF REAL LIFE NOT A DISNEY FAIRY TALE. TRUST ME DON'T WASTE YO TIME IT AINT WORTH IT.
3,It could have been better,"I was really fascinated with A Hustler's Wife. I compared to many books I've read and said that was the best one even better then Coldest Winter Ever. But this book was just not at the same level as the last book. I think it was a nice love joint and the whole but should have been about Indie and her. The twist at then end was nice should have went into more detail instead of rushing the ending. I think a lot of the authors on the meow production or what ever the group is called rush the endings of their books. The ending is the most important part to close all the thought the reader has and so the reader can really say wow that was a good book. Overall good job but, not at the same level as your first book. I can't really say I'll buy another but will borrow and share with someone because It wasn't worth my money!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,THIS BOOK IS A MUST TO BUY,I READ THIS BOOK IN THREE DAYS. THIS BOOK SHOW HOW THIS CHICK WENT FROM RAGE TO RICHES AND BACK TO RICHES. SHE WAS A STRONG LADY SHE NEVER LOOK BACK. NO MATTER HOW HARD IT WAS SHE WENT STRAIGHT FORWARD. YOU MUST GET THIS BOOK IT WAS SO GOOD. NIKKI YOU DID IT AGAIN.
2,Calling All Project Chicks!,"This book is for you. It was written specifically for you and about you. I don't know who else that can relate to this garbage! The plot was BLAH, the characters were BLAH, and the editing was BLAH BLAH BLAH and BLAH. I think at one point the author forgot whether she was writing in first person or third! My God! NIKKI, baby do you have your stuff edited? I wish I knew someone I could refer you to because your publishing company is just throwing you in the fire with gasoline underwear on!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Still not feeling her,"I know a lot of people are not going to like this, but I am still not feeling Nikki Turner as an author. For ghetto fiction she writes too many unbelievable story lines.A Project Chick had me in the beginning with her struggle, but as the book went on I was like oh my god this is crazy. I guess that's why its called fiction.Later!!!"
2,project chick,I must admit I was totally feeling the book for the first half. Then the other half she got all unrealistic and it really did make sense how it ended one moment she said lucky lights went out and the next he was in the story alive.Some scenes were redundant and absurd and to me she was lucky that they even published the book sorry but I was a fan of your first book but the second one was a great dissapointment TRY AGAIN
2,Let Down!,"I really enjoy Nikki work, but Project Chick wasn't the best.Who ever did the editing need to be fired! I understand doing the street lango, but getting the charcters wrong in the book was the worst. Saying that a charcter was speaking when they died chapters before was a let down!"
1,Warning,"This Author shows no growth between her previous book and this one, in fact, she declines. I gave the last one two stars for entertainment value, but this one was straight up stupid. There was nothing real about it except for the fact that the main character is triffling (Although the author does not seem to think so). Nikki Turner seems to think that women who mess with hustlers and hustle themselves in any kind of way, including prostituion, deserve to be on some kind of pedestal. The publisher also has not shown any kind of growth, or hired a decent proof reader to catch the horrible spelling and editing mistakes. These books must be typed on the typewriter, what other excuse is there for not using SPELLCHECK? The story line is all over the place, there is just nothing real about it. Keep trying Nikki. I don't recommend buying this book. You can have my copy for free."
3,Just Alright For Me,"I thought this book was just ok. The editing was horrible. Can we get one book from the urban fiction genre that has good editing?The Richmond, VA references that Nikki gives in her books are always on point and she didn't disappoint in that aspect. I also liked the fact that the main character, Tressa wasn't just some around the way chickenhead but an intelligent woman trying to make ends meet. But the situations weren't new which didn't make it a page turner for me. The ending was pretty good so that earned a star by itself.With all that said I would still read another book from this author, she has potential. I just wouldn't buy the book, I'd check it out of the library."
5,Wonderful is all I can say.,as in 'full of Wonder'.I bought this for a Christmas present and the recipient has enjoyed it very much.
4,Sexy comfortable top - NOT A REAL CORSET!,"My wife loves this top. I love the way it looks on her. It pulls in and shapes ever so slightly to emphasize her hips and bust. Plus, the soft, shiny fabric is a pleasure to touch.The boning seems to be plastic, so there're no wires to poke through or dig in. Also, the fabric in the back has a bit of give, so there is a little flexibility with sizing. The cups are a bit overly roomy, seemingly made with larger breasts in mind - if you are smaller than a C cup, you might not feel fully supported.Remember, this is NOT a real corset. It just looks like one. If you're seeking serious shaping, this top will probably not be firm enough. However, if you just want a cute top that will get some attention, you can't beat the price."
5,"A LITTLE SOMETHIN TO ROLL TO, AND SMOKE TO....","I BOUGHT THE CD THE DAY IT CAME OUT AND EVER SINCE THEN IT HAS BEEN BUMPIN IN MY CAR, MY FRIENDS CAR, MY HOUSE, FRIENDS HOUSE....EVERYWHERE I GO. I WOULD DEFINATLY RECOMEND THAT ANYONE WHO LIKES THE ORIGINAL FLOWS AND BEATS OF THE DAYTON FAMILY SHOULD HELP SUPPORT THIS L.P. AND HOPEFULLY MORE WILL FOLLOW."
4,YO DIS KYNNA HOT,BOOtLEG AN DA DAYTON FAMILY BRING IT WIT DIS 1...NUMBA 9 12 AN 13 R ESPECIALLY GOOD BUT DA WHOLE CD PRETTY TITE...ALSO GOT A COUPLE OF SLOW JOINTZ ON DERE 4 ALL YALL EMOTIONAL PEOPLE. IF U HAD ENOUGH INTREST 2 LOOK IT UP I SAY U READY 2 GO BUY IT.
5,BOOTLEG,Even though this cd isnt out yet I feel its going to be rowdy. Especially after bootleg coming out of prison. He's going to show what he's all about.
1,expensive coasters,"I too bought these after not finding spindles of the Verbatim DL. A few work, but only a very few. I have an NEC recorder which works completely reliably on most media but not these. The machine is a dual Xeon with 2GB of RAM, so this is not a resource issue. Sigh."
4,Memorex DVD+R,"Product works fine, no flaws or re-writes due to errors. The CD face is lined with dots, would rather it be plain or just have the manufactures name. This would allow marking the contents easier."
4,Good Product - reasonable price,What can you say about recordable media. This is packaged well. The shipment came as indicated in the order and all seems to be in order.
4,great,"i have no problem with this item, i use top buy a noname brands but allways there was a problems,so i try this item no problems..great item."
1,MemorXthatout,"I bought two 25 packs on sale and regret it. I've used about half of them and have thrown out around 5 because they wouldn't work. Now I come to find out that even though the images I saved on one disc before overhauling my pc are showing as thumbnails(I did a double check before deleting them) the disc causes whatever program I'm trying to open a file with to lock up, so it's useless and now I worry that I may not be able to replace some of those images and photoshop projects that I use on my website. If I were the litigious type I would be discussing a lawsuit right now. I worry as well about all the other disc's I have burned which I haven't actually tried to open a file on yet."
5,These are perfectly fine!!,"I've used memorex dvd+r's for 6 years now. If you are having a lot of problems burning DVD's it probably is the software you are using! Like any blank DVD media they don't last forever. I haven't had a coaster in 4 years. These are GREAT DVD's and are a GREAT price. I've used memorex dvd+r 4x, 8x and 16x over the years as burning speeds have upgraded. People are giving them 1 star but it's their human error and crappy software/computer that is causing them problems. If you know what you are doing, get these! Well actually, if you know what you are doing you probably already use memorex and love them :)"
1,ABSOLUTE JUNK!,Backed up some movies and not even 1 played well. They either skipped or didn't play at all. I backed up my harddrive with one of these and some of the files won't even open... says damaged or corrupted files... ABSOLUTE JUNK! I will stick with Verbatim from now on!
4,"Pretty good, not the best though","Memorex dvd blanks are my second choice and I bought two 50-count stacks of these because they had a great deal going on. In a perfect world, I would have gotten the same deal on 50-count stacks of Maxell dvd blanks. They are the best but you'll have a hard time finding a deal on them since everyone else knows they are the best."
5,Memorex 16X DVD+R,"I have never had any problem with these discs. While I will go with other brands IF price requires it, the Memorex are my first choice. I do wish they made a LightScribe version."
3,good but not,"it was good for the 1st 10-15 discs but the remaining couldn't be recorded on as stated disc error on every disc after that, but other discs which recorded fine."
2,Could of been better,"I'm not happy with this product. I'm trying to burn home movies on. There are 6 already that are crap. I should of came on amazon to read the reviews. I had no problem with my older disk for burning the same memorex dvds on. That is really sad, and a waste of money. I hope you get it fixed. I hate having to try and burn a dvd and it doesn't work then have to get another one hoping that will work."
5,Good for what they're meant for,This item works like it is made for. I use them to make backups of our very well used children's movies. I can replace these and not worry about it as much and the Kids don't touch the store bought versions.
1,Very poor,"Hello. I transfer VHS home movies to DVD and I always used Memorex for years. Since buying the last batch, many have returned them saying they dont work. They burn fine but they cant watch them. I therefor have switch to verbatim. I cant afford these bad DVDs anymore. Memorex went down hill bad.Rick"
4,pretty good sounding,"traditionally this Memorex brand which I've carried at my store, has been looked down upon for quality. they've really improved the sound lately and I would recommend this product when well priced."
1,DO NOT BUY,I bought these and a new burner. They only worked for data. I went out and bought a diffrent brand and those worked just fine. I used Nero. and 1click dvd copy.
1,WARNING MEMOREX DVDS HAVE NO LASTING LIFE,"I had no problems burning to these discs, its when I went back a few months later to these discs and found out that none of them work anymore. After further research I found out that Memorex uses the cheapest dye available and thus the DVDs have absolutelly no life to them, my discs started dying after a few months.In addition, in you physically hold the disc in your hands you can feel how warped physically it has become. This is true for all the discs (about 150 of them). I CAN NOT NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT STRONLY ENOUGH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,"Burns Ok, but will not read in set-top player.","I was able to burn videos to these discs just fine. Don't let that fool you though. I was disgusted to find out that nearly all of them would not play correctly on my Sony set-top DVD player. Whenever they get to the end of the movie, the player skips back a few chapters or just quits all together. The problem seems to be at the outside of the disks because the shorter movies that I burned seemed to work ok (they don't use the whole disk). I could even look at the burnt disks under a bright light and see dark spots on the disks that I think is just poor manufacturing. I was able to read them again on my PC though and make another copy to a good disk so that was life saver. My suggestion, go with another company that actually has a quality assurance department."
1,Garbage!,"To back up my personal DVD collection I burned 200 discs. 100 on these Memorex DVD+R's, 100 on Philips DVD+R's. EVERY Memorex had flaws during playback. EVERY Philips was flawless. I've been buying Memorex for years but I'll never buy Memorex again."
2,marine radio,Not bad price for the unit but way too many steps just to get it to scan which is usually a one button step in most marine radios.
4,"Not good, not crap. Not everyone will like it.","This book is a page turner, I'll give it that. And, surprisingly, it manages to be fairly realistic while maintaining suspense. The characters are great. I only have a few comlaints. It could have been made a lot more suspenseful. And there was a couple of stages in the book that were just stupid or boring."
1,Not relevant,"I completed every test over and over, attempting to review and learn the concepts that would be on the ACWA test. The test itself was MUCH harder that anything provided in this study book. The vocabulary section was helpful, but the math section was completely useless. I would advise to spend the extra money and purchase the other version."
2,Game is fun but Leatherette case is poorly made,"When I open my package from Amazon, which contained the Rummikub game, I noted the shipping box had the proper packing material to keep the game secure in the box during shipping. Yet, the 'Leatherette' (must be Chinese for micro-thin, leather colored, brittle plastic coating) case was damaged on the two top front corners of the case, and, one of the two, under sized, miniature hinges on the case was missing the hing pin. It wasn't even in the shipping box. The damaged corners were quite visible as I opened the package. This indicates to me that the damage was there before shipping. I use to enjoy playing tile rummy with my parents 20 years ago and I purchased this game to play with my grandchildren. I love the game but it's a d*@n shame we can't get the Chinese to use better material to make these games.Bruce Cooper"
1,Had to return it,"Rummikub is a terrific game, but it's just amazing how Pressman has botched the manufacturing of it.We were replacing an old set that had confusing rules, tiles that revealed the numbers when they were upside down, tiles with the blue and the black colors too similar and racks where the legs were too loose and fell out easily during game play.So, we bought this new set, hoping that by paying some extra to get a more deluxe version, the manufacturing problems would be solved. The tiles were very nice with big numbers and distinct colors, but the legs didn't fit into the racks at all. The ends of the legs were too big for the holes in the racks. Had to return it."
1,Vimla,"Tiles kept on falling of the rack, I wish it was little wider so it can balance little better. We all ended up living our tiles on the table surface as we could not keep them from falling off."
3,Larger Version Rummikub,"Thought I'd LOVE this edition of the game due to larger tiles & easier to see colors. However, I HATE the flimsy tile-holder racks, and the tiles have a slicker, different feel. The carrying case and tile colors are nice. For a deluxe edition, I wish they had made more durable racks that didn't have to be assembled each time I play....and that would hold up rather than collapse. Very disappointed in this version. I also like the racks with three ""shelves"" rather than two.I will admit that taller racks that don't allow opponents to see how many tiles are left make the game more challenging."
4,Very Fun Game!,"I love this game, just wish the box had a better space to hold the tiles in when you are not using them. As it is they float all around in the giant case and can be a real mess when you get the game out."
4,Great Game,"I have an old edition of this wonderful game and wanted to get one for my son and his children. The quality of the pieces has really deteriorated since I got our original one many years ago. The pieces are very light weight. It's unfortunate, but I think that's just a sign of the times."
3,fun game cheap case,"This is a great game! My husband and I love to play it. My only complaint is that the leather case it came in broke within minutes of opening it. The handle came off the first time I held it. So, i'm not sure the extra dollars for the ""special"" leather case is worth it- But, the game itself is great"
2,Cheap easels,"This is a great game for families and players of all ages over 5 or 6, but the easels used for this particular version are awful--the tiles don't stay on and the whole thing can fall over. Get the less expensive one with the sturdy, lower blue easels."
5,great game to stimulate the mind!,"We bought this game for the cold winter nights. I'm use to playing Rummy with 2 decks of cards, which is also easier. This is a different game slightly and actually a lot more interesting. You start with 14 pieces just like you would start with 14 cards in Rummy, but the difference here is you play with no discard. Also, you don't have one big pile you are drawing from, all the remaining tiles are stacked in 7's so that you also get the randomness of which pile to start next. Highly addictive and very fun game!"
5,family fun,Not only the children. But all the family enjoyed playing together. And the game is in a good condition.
5,Love is At It's Best,"Someone finally made it possible to get alot of great songs and put it on a c.d.! I love maximum slow jams not only because it is a great gift to give to someone you love, but also the fact that all the songs take you back to a specail person in your life ( if their not still there). I loved all the songs especially Keith Sweat Make It Last Forever and Chaka Chan's Through The Fire ! This blazing hot c.d. needs to be in everyone's c.d. collection ! You won't be maxed out!"
4,Bobby-Soxer,"This is a coming of age story of a young woman growing up in a small town in New Jersey in the 1950's. It deals with the discovery of knowing your family with all their faults...her father having a mistress who dies and leaves her estate to his wife and daughter, her father's mother who is 100 years old and still rules the family, her mother, a southerner who lays on the couch reading and eating bon bons but dresses each day as if to dine with the King of France.The family drifts apart over the years as the young woman grows and becomes a remarkable woman and in doing so finds out the wonderful secrets of her family."
5,good workout dvd,"good workout dvd, anyone looking for a workout dvd, this is it. and the price is right on foreman's workouts."
