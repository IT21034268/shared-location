5,Excellent product,"The qulaity is superb, it is just what I expected and the item arrived when projected. I am very pleased!"
2,Much smaller than expected,"The quality seems okay, but the size that came is much smaller than expected. They should put some measurement tips in the notes so people know how to estimate the size better. I did not and I was suprised by how small this is. Bummer.The color is somewhat faded compared to the picture. That is my only other complaint; size and color not as expected."
4,"Exactly how it looks, not a quick connect","I tried to match this color with a leash I ordered, but they are off by a shade. I think they will eventually match after some wear. This fits on the 2nd notch for my dog and it's difficult to connect to the leash quickly since the overlap is so thick. I'm hoping that as it is used more often, the flap will be more flexible."
4,"Nice quality, but order up a size!","This appears to be a nicely made product in a pretty reddish brown collar. After a coat of oil to soften it up and condition the leather, which was pretty dry out of the box, I expect it will hold up nicely as my dog's primary collar.BUT, I'm glad I read other reviews that advised to add 2 or 3"" to your dog's actual collar size to determine her size in this collar. The measurements on this one are taken from end to end - meaning from the loose end to the end of the buckle - which is strange, because the first hole is punched a couple inches down from the end. Our German Shepherd needs a 19"" collar, and I was not sure whether 22"" or 24"" would be better. I went with the 24"", which fits her on the second to tightest hole. 22"" would probably have been long enough, but this will work fine. SIZE UP!"
2,POS,"Broke after only a month, really a poor quality collar. It was a nice collar if only it had lasted."
2,OK Product,The original size I bought was too small for my beagle (18 in) so I had to size up to 20in. I don't like how the colour rubs off on my dog's white neck. Had I known that I would have gotten a different collar.
3,Not what I had hoped,"Its important to note that this collar is measured end to end and not from buckle to middle hole like some collars. This means it is much much to small for my little guy and returning from Aus will be a pain. Its also very very stiff to when received and I wont find out if it will soften over time. I have no idea what the leather has been rolled around, but what ever has been painted over the back does not really look like it will last on long, though for all I know it might. Have given it 3 stars as it is still what it says it is - just not what I was expecting that meant..."
3,Too Small,"This collar is pretty small. Needs to be used on pretty small dogs. The 12"" is measured from the beginning of the metal clasp to the END of the collar. The last hole is likely 11"" from the end of the clasp and 10.5"" from the beginning of the leather. I returned this because I need a collar that is bigger. My dog needs 12"" from the beginning of the leather to the hole. Amazon took care of me though, so i'm a very satisfied consumer."
5,Well Made and Sturdy Collar,"These rolled Leather collars are made with some serious hardware and I have found thru the years the rolled leather least interferes with any dogs coat. My still overly rambunctious yellow lab Buddy pulls on his lead to tow me around the block, but the collar shows no sign of stress or strain. (I wish I could say the same about my arm!)."
3,Hamilton collar is mis-sized.,"The quality of the collar is beautiful; however, the 12"" collar is 12 inches end-to-end, and will not buckle around a 12"" neck."
3,Looks Interesting,"Funny how the ""Texas Refugee"" has bought this box set that has not been released. Hmmm.I am looking forward to seeing the 1935 A Midsummer Night's Dream and the 1996 Hamlet again. I have not seen MND for a very long time, but I have very fond memories of it. The 1996 Hamlet is arguably the best on film.(Why do I have ""Peter Jackson"" in my badge?)"
1,not good at all...,"I bought this book at the end of the semester to review for the gross anatomy shelf exam. I quickly discovered that the text is horrible, diagrams lacking, and the questions are FULL of errors. I loved BRS neuroanatomy and physiology, but this book isn't very good. I put it down after half a day of frustration and just focused on Netters (and kicked butt on the shelf)."
2,"If you cant stand looking at an informative picture, buy it!","This book is cerainly a disgrace for BRS in general. Unlike the beautiful Biochemistry and Physiology BRS, this Anatomy book is really a disaster at least reputation wise for the BRS. Yu don't believe me, just buy it and you will NOT want to study from it. The most crucial thing in Anatomy is a good diagram, but there are few diagrams and they are horrible anyways!"
1,DID NOT RECEIVE,It has been one month and 6 days since I purchased this and I have yet to receive it. I would like a refund!
5,my all time favorite movie,"flashpoint has it all...political intrigue, jokes, murder...death...mayhem...it's the perfect guy movie. two texas border patrol agents are frustrated with their jobs and are looking for a way out, when one of them stumbles upon it. it turns out the feds have been looking for this very same thing for some time as well, and the chase is on!! only who will win, the high-tech federal agents, or the street smart texas border patrol agents?"
2,THE DVD HAS BEEN CUT PEOPLE!,"Great film-would normally give it 5 stars. But as others have NOTED it has been cut. Thus I'm at a loss reading reviews from folks who claimed to have seen it in the theaters(I did) and give it high marks-The most important single line in the movie- the line that makes the movie AND THE ENDING--when Rip Thorn points to the rifle and says that is the gun that did it (aka shot Kennedy) IS MISSING. I can only assume they lost the Master Negative and just used an existing print for the DVD and that print had damage at some point and was missing the line....Totally incredible-the one line that makes the movie, makes the ending and it is missing. Like an idiot I threw away my VHS copy before watching the DVD.."
4,Not just for fitness models,What a great book for both aspiring fitness models and the average fitness buff. It was easy to read and a good inside look at the fitness industry. There's tones of great advise from top people in the industry and Clark's philosophy for success is great for everyone. I recommend this book for anyone with an interest in fitness whether you want to be a fitness model or not. Learning what's it takes to be one of the people you see in the magazines is fascinating for any fitness enthusiast.
4,Excellent career guide for everyone,"I really found the insight in the book valuable. I'm a Korean (i.e., Asian) but found a lot of elements to which I can relate from my personal experiences. The book contains excellent insight and advice from these successful individuals who managed to crack the corporate code and climb the ladder. I'd recommend this book to anyone who's interested in climbing the corporate ladder."
3,Better than the first one,This one is better than foundation's fear - much more like an Asimov creation. I am interested to see where third one is headed.
2,Terrible,"All the books in the ""Second Foundation Trilogy"" are terrible and leave me not wanting to finish any of them. Found myself skimming pages instead."
1,Greats cast of characters,Great cast of characters. I like the way he works the robots into the plot. nice plot. also he has a nice plot but no as good as Assmove's plot.
1,One star is too much already,"Not even close to the concept, the narrative, and the eloquence of the Master (Isaac Asimov). There is no mystery. What it is is a soap opera with pages upon pages of silly dialogue. If allowed, I suppose that Mr. Bear would throw in a few light-saber fights and describe them blow-by-blow, grunt-by-grunt. A silly, silly book, but to be fair, Benford's Foundation Fear is in the same league (and ""Forward"" and ""Prelude"" by the late Master are no gems either.)The two most interesting characters are Tritch and Mors Planch. Tritch gets a few lines and Planch some more, but not enough.Why can't Dan Simmons or Vernon Vinge be asked to write a sequel to ""Foundation and Earth"". Now there's a mystery worth pursuing and with them the Asimov Estate would do well to preserve and honor the spirit of the ""Foundation"" series."
4,Foundation and Chaos,"This is the best book of the new trilogy. After reading this one I recommended to a few friends that they read the first one just so that they could get to this one. I've read everything Isaac Asimov has ever written, but nothing by Greg Bear except perhaps maybe one of his short stories. Now that Isaac is gone, I now look forward to checking out what other novels Mr Bear has written."
4,Almost like asimov's work,"I was extremely dissapointed with the first installment in the second trilogy so I thought for a while of not reading this book in case it was just like the first. I'm glad I didn't skip it; it was the exact opposite of Benford's book -- interesting, well written, and it does a great job of keeping the Foundation universe alive; the parts with R.Daneel had me turning pages for a while! It was almost enough to save the series on its own. Hopefully brin's book will be as good!"
4,Foundation and Chaos: Isaac would be proud!,"As many of you contemplating this second book of the ""new"" trilogy may think, I thought that no one could possibly capture the writing style and depth of Isaac Asimov...especially after that abysmal first installment. ""Foundation and Chaos"" was a terrific read that Asimov would be proud of. I lost myself in this novel, not only enjoying the story, but reminiscing in the memorable moments from this legendary Asimov series. As described in other reviews, you will truly beileve that you are reading an Asimov novel. Thank you Greg Bear."
5,Foundation Triology review,"I have read both Foundation's Fear and Foundation and Chaos. They are different but equal in all respects. Foundation's Fear provides rich characters and fleshes out Hari in a way Asimov could not do because of his style. Foundation and Chaos brought us close again to the world of Asimov with his robots. I have been a fan of asimov since the early 60's and thoughly enjoyed both book but in different ways. I noticed a number of reviews seem to discount Foundation's Fear because it strayed from the Asimov style. Dispite this, or maybe because of it, it is still a very good story. It caused me to like and understand Hari. If you van begin to like and understand Hari you will enjoy the original Asimov all the more. Just as likeing and understanding Susan Calvin is necesary to enjoying the robots. I recommend them both to the readers but warn that without reading the original asimove they would be missing a lot."
1,"trivial, boring, bears worst","I like greg bear and have read nearly everything he's written. This is without a doubt the least entertaining of his books I've encountered. I also read the first book of this series -Gregory Benfords' Foundations Fear' and which (I thought) was dynamite. Benford fleshed out Asimovs universe, expanded Hari Seldons character and a lot happened in that book. Bear goes retro on us and seems to try and capture what Asimov was doing when he wrote the foundation books. He shrinks Benfords sparkling new universe, and nothing much happens in his book. I know Asimov was one of the greats but he was a conceptual genius. His books were not big on character development or plotting. Frankly if he came on the scene today he would not be well known. The purpose of this series was not so much to reprise Asimovs' Foundation Universe as it was to update it. Bear has missed the point, buy Foundations Fear, look for David Brins next installment but skip this one."
5,Fantastic and imaginative!,"I was impressed beyond my wildest expectations (which were quite low after having read Foundation's Fear)! Greg Bear's creative imagination has added a powerful, page-turning interpretation of the Grand Master's universe. What a fantastic idea R. Lodovic presented! Bear's climactic recreation of Seldon's trial also had me fully engrossed. I finished the book in 3 hours without pause. Asimov would have been proud to see his Foundation series added to with this wild tale."
4,"The best of the three ""new"" Foundation Books","By far the best plotted and written of the three new Foundation books. Bear explores some very interesting nuances of the Foundation Galaxy such as ""emotions"" in the robot Dors, the various ""heresies"" amongst robots when it comes to the 3/4 Laws of Robotics, and the effect of no laws. He actually does something useful with the incredibly misguided ""sim"" story line foisted on us by Benford. And while focusing on robots, he doesn't overdo their impact the way Brin does in the third book in the series.My only wish is that Bear had written all three of the books."
5,THIS AM BAD BOOK OR ELSE!,Me am thinking you not like this book because it not about Bizarros. It am about Bizarros. Bizzaro code: Us do opposite of earthly things. You am not going to read this book. IT AM BAD. :o)
2,I don't like it,"This game has great voice acting, graphics, and plot. So far it sounds like a good game, but it isn't. I beat it in 5 days which consisted of running around in the same looking levels fighting the same looking bad guys. It's nearly impossble to beat without a guide book. You'll have no idea whats going on if you never played blood omen or the soul reavers. One awful thing is that you can't first play the game as kain and then as Raziel. It swiches off between them."
1,RUNAWAY! Don't buy this flash drive!,"2 major problems:1. flash drive I received looks nothing like advertisement picture, nowhere on any of the packaging materials does Samsung's name or logo appear. This drive is marked in generic fashion ""FLASH DRIVE - 16 GB USB"". Plenty of data storage problems. Data disappears and fragments, what is retained and what gets corrupted is a crapshoot.2. attempted to contact seller twice to get refund or was even willing to accept new drive if I just happened to receive drive with faulty flash memory. No reply, nothing. Since this is through a third party merchant, can't get a refund from Amazon."
2,Not so good...,"I liked this album the very first time I listened to it, about three years ago. About the third time I listened to it I turned it off because I got bored of it. I usually don't get bored of cds that quickly, most cds take at least six months for me to get tired of them but this one was on the shelf in a week! I don't ever listen to it any more, the music is poppy but it's out of date, I would reccomend Oxygen if you want an Avalon cd."
4,Avalon's Debut CD,"I honestly first listened to this CD when it had just been released several years back ( in '94 or '95?). It is not as fast paced or vivid as the latest CDs that they have released, but what drew me to this group was their awesome talent in harmony and energy. It is a group that has definitely succeeded in bringining the Christian community a fresh view of the Christian faith."
2,Whole Wheat Bredsticks,"This product is not as good as the brand that you carried prior to this (Fattorie & Pandea). These aren't as crispy and the taste is not that of the whole wheat flavor that makes it much better than plain white bread sticks, these really have not much taste at all."
4,Be careful with sizing,"Contrary to another review, I found that these shoes do NOT run large. I usually wear a size 8. I ordered an 8 and found it a little too small. I recommend finding somewhere where you can try any Capezio shoes on first to check for sizing before you order a pair online."
3,chabelo cd & dvd,"Disappointed. I wanted one specific song on cd, Mamacita, donde esta Santa Claus?. It was the same titled song, but the wrong rhythm. I wanted the cha cha cha version, but the song on this cd is a slower rumba rhythm. What a bummer!!!! All the songs are cute for kids. Haven't watched the dvd."
4,One of the 3 books for the Cranford TV series on PBS,If you liked the TV series Cranford on PBS this is a must read. Very easy reading and hard to put down.
3,"Great graphics, good sound, lots of storage, but..",I gave this item to my daughter for Christmas and she loved it until the battery died completely and would not charge. This happened exactly 30 days after purchase. She ended up having to send it back to the Creative Zen people. Hopefully they will replace the item or repair it satisfactorily.
4,Outstanding Product,"Have had for over a month now and have found it to be excellent quality and possessing outstanding sound output. Organization of outlook data a little cumbersome, but still well worth the price!"
4,Software is an issue,"Others have posted more complete info, so I will not rehash that.Briefly, I was very pleased with the audio quality. The video quality is very good also, considering the tiny screen. These should be deciding factors for many people.The mechanical ergonomics and user interface takes a little getting used to, but overall, Creative did a fine job. You will probably want to set the pad sensitivity to low.The player works with the supplied Creative software, and Windows Media Player 10. The problems I encountered importing my mp3's were duplicate tracks and album art. Depending on how many mp3's you have and if you care about album art, this may not be a problem for you. In my opinion, neither WMP or the Creative software makes it very easy for you.The Creative Labs user forums are very active, and should be a good source for help on the issues you may encounter. Also, Creative company people also monitor and respond."
1,defective,"I purchase this for my son for Christmas, within two weeks the playerlocked up and wouldn't re-boot. We went thru 5 replacements, Amazonreplacing each one. Each one froze up for no apparent reason and allmy son's data was lost. Creative Labs was completely unhelpful. Iwill never, never purchase any Creative Lab product again."
1,Great Disappointment,"After doing what I believed to be a great deal of research, I purchased the Creative Zen Vision:M. I also purchased the optional charger. When charging the player(with the optional charger)for the first time, the player went into recovery mode. I was not able to reset the player using any of the suggestions given by Creative Labs. I found the user manual to be woefully inadequate. I am now waiting for Creative to repair or replace what was a brand new and unused player."
1,Lasted 3 months & 2 weeks,"I started getting lock-up problems after the 2nd month of having this thing, and now 3 months & 2 weeks after buying it, it's completely worthless. The display first became completely corrupted, and now nothing works. Warranty is 3 months for labor. How convenient! Can probably buy another MP3 for less than they'd charge to fix it--but it's not gonna be this brand. I took extreme care to not damage it in any way, so it wasn't abused. I also have a Samsung--only 4 GB--but it's sound is a LOT better. Don't buy this one."
2,haha,449 dollars? haha this player was great until it stopped working what a pos now. me and 5 other owners had the same problem where this player would not connect to any computer. POS
4,not certain,"I saw the Vision: M in a store and thought it rocked. I've looked at about 10 MP3s, and this has many more features than most other ones. I didn't buy it right away because the salesperson wasn't helpful. I'm not very technically savvy yet (this would be my first MP3) and can't find the answers to my questions anywhere. I want to know if I can download from iTunes to the Vision: M, and if I can ""copy"" songlists from my friend's iPod. Also, would I be able to download from NPR or old Seinfeld episodes?If anyone knows, let me know. [ GLMSW@hotmail.com ]"
1,Works for a month.,"This product is HORRIBLE quality! I am on my second one, and it only worked for a month! My dell jukebox lasted me through countless falls for over three years! For this price, it should work over 2 months. Do not buy this unless you are willing to get it replaced over and over again."
1,email and long distance customer support was not helpul,"I have over 200 CD on my computer that are in the WMA ""Lossless"" format. After several emails and finally a long distance call to Creative I find out that they do not support this format and can not help. They said that ""maybe"" if I gat a Codec from Microsoft that would help, but they could not tell me which one to get. The only reason to buy this product is b/c it is MS compliant and in theory should work better with XP and other applications. However, I have learned it is no more compliant then IPOD. Since this player is not fully MS compliant like they stated I am taking it back and going with the smaller and more ergonomic IPOD.Bottom line buy the IPOD it smaller and better!"
2,kind of looks like an iPod,"Looks a lot like an iPod. I don't like the software as much as itunes. Wouldn't say this was a ""bargain"""
4,Zen Vision is a Vision,So far the Creative Zen Vision M haas exceeded all my expectations. In comparison to my old ipod- there is none. the creative zen is far more user friednly in my opinion. I haven't dug into the videos aspect yet but for everything else... this item is on point. My mom is getting one ecause she's jealous of mine.
5,Fantastic player,"Update after using it for more than 2.5 years:I have been using my 30 GB Zen Vision M player for more than 2 years now and it is simply fantastic. I have used it both in media and data mode and there have been no problems what so ever. The bundled software is just fine - helps load media, create/manage playlists etc. FM radio works perfectly and catches all the stations available. I have loaded both TV sitcoms as well as full length movies and have had no issues playing them on this player. The stock ear-phones are also good - you can get adequate thump!!Back when I purchased it, I got the same question from everybody - Why not Ipod? Well, I don't want hassles loading my huge mp3 collection to a player. Plus I get the FM radio built into the player instead of having to buy it separately. I had used Creative products in the past and knew that they care about audio quality. I'm glad I made the right choice."
2,Worked for 2 weeks,"Controls are difficult to master and the documentation is sketchy. Real problem came after 2 weeks. With about 150 CDs loaded the device is no longer recognized by the Creative Media Explorer software. After a few hours of digging on their web site and discussions with tech support, the only solution they can offer is to reformat - deleting everything - with the hope that this will work and it will again be able to accept data. So my choice is (1) to chance the reformat with the best case scenario of having to spend several hours reloading the disk - or (2) live with the music I have already loaded. They say the problem is likely a ""corrupt"" track on one of my CDs. All my CDs are legit original copies. Not being able to deal with this is a serious design defect."
4,This little guy is the shiznit,"I bought this with 2 expectations. Good sound/image quality and long battery life. They both passed with flying colors. Also, this product has the capability to import AVI, and DivX files and read them through the easily managable file management program with the unit. Lightweight design, excellent menu system and interface. Only downfall, is it locks-up occassionally-have that paperclip ready. But the lock-ups are the fault of crappily edited AVI files.Unlike the Ipod which supplies nothing except directions to download Itunes which is anal, this product has it all and is of great value $[...] or >. Get it."
5,AWESOME!!!,"One word comes to mind when I think of the Zen Vision:M. ""WOW!"" This is one great media player, I've had mine for about a week or two, And I love it! The Video quality is incredible! Everything about it Rocks! In my opinion this thing beats the [...] outa the video ipod. I totaly recommend this product to anyone in search of a good media player."
4,Excellent player for excellent price,"It looks great, it works great and its storage is great! The missing star is for being not able to play some special types of video. But that's fine."
5,Creative Zen,"This unit is just what I wanted. It is very easy to use and load from my desktop PC. It will play video, audio, and works like a PDA with a voice recorder. The main feature is the fact that it doesn't change the format of my MP3 files. They are loaded and played as MP3, and kept that way. Although it is a little heaver than other units, this unit costs about 15% less. I would recommend the Creative ZEN Model M."
1,My Vision:M is now in the trash can,"I would not recommend this product to anyone. It froze up two days after I got it and needed to be reset. I should have sent it back as soon as that happened. After that it continued to freeze on a regular basis. A few months later, out of the blue, it stopped connecting to my computer properly. To fix that problem I had to reformat it and lose all 3000 songs I had loaded. After the reformat it started to die a slow death.The last straw for me was when I tried to turn it on and nothing would happen even when it was fully charged. I got fed up a put in the trash can. I will never buy another Creative product."
1,Won't buy Creative again,"The battery could not be recharged after sitting off for 30 days. The online support pages were not helpful, and it was impossible to contact a person for technical help. Thanks for some kind people at a Creative forum I tried all the tricks and finally gave up. I won't buy another Creative product. I am now in the market for a new mp3 player."
1,piece of crap,"i've had this player for less than 6 months, and just recently it started to malfunction.... sometimes it wont even turn on even though it's fully charged.I've never dropped it or anything and it keeps taking me to some shortcut screen on it, and i can't even get to my music or videosdont buy...."
3,5 stars if it would ship already!,"I previously bought a creative zen micro from amazon and i absolutley love it. I cant get enough of it. I listen to it every possible minute i can. Ive had this for about a year and a half, and i saw that creative came out with the vision m. I did hours of research on it. I compared it to the IPod video, and decided that the vision m was the mp3 video player for me. My dad has an IPod video and he loves it, but recently the hard drive crashed on him. I ordered the vision m in white because the black really shows finger prints and scratches. I ordered this product on March 28 and today is April 28. Amazon still hasnt shipped this product, and I payed extra for express shipping. I am getting extremely impatient, but from what i hear ""good things are worth waiting for"""
1,"It'd decent, but overpriced for the lifespan","This unit falls into the ""iPod wannabe"" category... i personally held off the Apple wagon for a long time... Now having owned both, I can say that this unit has a touchy navigation pad, an lackluster menu system, and (this is the dealbreaker) after a bit of use i put it down for a few months, came back to start using it again as a storage device and the unit would not hold a charge nor run at all unless plugged into the charger...Essentially a several hundred dollar paperweight..."
1,Creative Zen M - junk!,I purchased a Creative Zen M 4 months ago. I had it 2 weeks and had to return it because the hard drive kept freezing up. I got a new one and it wasn't any better. The company wouldn't work because I had lost the original purchase receipt (my fault). So it got dumped and I am now looking for something else. I had a creative Jukebox which ran and ran for years. This little machine however is a piece of junk. Be sure to check out the warranty before purchasing oneCreative Zen Vision:M 30 GB MP3 and Video Player (Black)
2,Just wanted a simple MP3 w/ Video capabilities,"The tech support is limited to one year, unless you pay an extensive amount for it. The software is incompatible with common mp3 sites (iTunes, Napster, etc) so everything has to be converted and unless you know what you're doing before getting it, there isn't much help available. I've had mine for nearly 2 years now (was a gift from my MIL) and still can't get videos to transfer without having bitrate issues, connectivity troubles, and ""cannot convert"" errors - using not only their software but 3rd party programs as well. It's beyond frustrating and I'm about to give in to the Apple craze and just buy an iPod, I have 4 kids and just don't have time to fiddle around with this thing. I want to load n' go. Seems like most of the reviews on here are pretty good so perhaps it's user error on my part? (I consider myself to be an intermediate pc user and am usually quite capable of figuring out electronics so I dunno.)"
4,Good music player,I bought this product about two years ago when it first became available. It is a great music player and the software that comes with it is not bad either. I would recommend this product.
3,Great player but beware.,"This is my second one. I also have a new 16mb flash player. I bought this one because of the capacity. But my first ones HDD died after 1 year , after the warranty was up. So if you buy one get the three year protection plan from Amazon. I believe Creative know about the HDD problem as it is very hard to buy a new one of these anymore even from Creative. Creative are cheaper and better than Apple, especially if you already have your music in MP3 format and do not need to but it."
4,Creative Zen Vision problems,Creative Zen Vision:M 30 GB MP3 and Video Player (Black)I like my MP3 very much except the controls are too sensitive. You have to slide up or down gently or it will not respond as you wanted.
2,beware,worked great for a year or so. Then all of the sudden it says I have a firm ware problem and I have yet to find a way to fix it or even get it to turn on again.. Also freezes up a lot. I suggest you just buy an ipod thats what I did. the 80 gig ipod classic is only 250.. This thing has been nothing but frustating. Also creative has bad customer service.. So just stick to ipod..
4,hands down better than iPod video...accessories an issue,"I bought myself this mp3 player on Xmas of 2006. Simply put: it beats iPod video hands down. Love the fact that you can throw any video format and it plays it. If not, included software does the conversion job for you. The only ""issue"" (that's why I'm not giving it the 5 stars) is finding accessories (that's the only regard were I envy iPod owners). To top it all, the connector is proprietary; I wanted to purchase a docking boombox and ended up buying an overpriced one at Creative's store."
1,Disapointed,"I should have learned the first time. So my Girlfriend ordered this product about 6 months ago and right out of the box it was defective, so we exchanged it for another one. (same model) well that one also came defective but she called and trouble shooted with Creative zens tech support and got it working. And I have to admit it has been working well. So I figured I'd give them a try myself and guess what. RIGHT OUT OF THE BOX IT IS DOA. (dead on arrival) So I think I'll be buying the IPOD for the extra $40"
2,Good MP3 Player but,"This is a good mp3 play but heavy, and thick. The music file system can only displayed by artist, albulm ect instead of by folders you creat. Although the language can change to Chinese, but it can not show the artists' names in chinese.So you can not find your chinese songs easily. The FM radio and recorder are good. It takes quite long to charge the machine from your comptuer. Returned it to Amazon."
1,horrible rip off,"My friend bought this player creative zen vision M 30 GB player as a gift for me after exhaustive comparison and reading hundreds of reviews between Ipod 30 GB and creative zen vision M 30 GB. It worked great for the few occasionally times I used. After not being used for a month, the battery completely drained and has never been able to charge ever since. I have tried charging it overnight through a computer. I have tried charging overnight with an AC adapter. Nothing works. I can only access its interface when its connected to a power supply. As soon as its taken out, instantaneously it dies out. I have even tried resetting it. No luck. I called the Creative customer service and they would not replace it as I do not have a proof of purchase as it was gift and my friend apparently did not care to save the receipt. I went online on Amazon and realized it costs over $250. I feel miserable that Creative refuses to fix a faulty product of theirs which is very much in warranty."
1,Hard drive died after two weeks,Just buy the freakin ipod. I wish I would have. Now i have a 200 dollar piece of plastic.
1,Never received item.,"I didn't receive the item, I don't think it was the seller's fault, it just didn't arrive."
5,AWESOME Player!,I like this player very much. Only issue is the scroll. Much too sensitive even at lowest setting. Otherwise a great player with a lot of functionality. Definitely recommend over ipod!
1,Started out great...,"... but after a few months the player developed charging and connection problems. No matter how I tried plugging the device in (AC or USB), the battery would not take any charge. As for the connection issues, I tried reinstalling the software but the player just would never register on either of my computers. I visited Creative's web site for help (these are common issues for them), but their solutions could not fix the problem. Out of warranty repairs would have cost almost as much as a new mp3 player. So thats what I ended up doing. My Ipod is working great so far."
4,Good price/quality relation,"I bought this player because of the combination of 30 GB hard disk mp3 player and fm-radio. The positive details are mentioned in many reviews. All in all I'm very satisfied with the purchase, although I think the player is a little bit to heavy, if you want to go jogging with it. Sometimes it crashes, if it gets moist from sweating. Compared to the I-Pod there are not so many useful accessories. You can not play songs while the Accu is recharging."
2,Frustrated and Puzzled,"While copying music to my mp3 player, I was asked by Creative Labs if I wanted to update the current operating software so I said yes. After the operating software was updated, the device stopped working stating that there was a firmware problem and no further explanation. I went to Creative Labs site and left an e-mail with their customer service dept. and was informed that I would have to mail the device to them in order for it to be fixed and that it was going to cost me another $50.Needless to say, I'm very upset since I've already spent enough money buying the device in the first place. Therefore, I recommend to everyone not to update their firmware and avoid buying their products altogether."
2,don't do it !,when it was working it was great but these creative products don't seem to last very long. in the past 4 years i've had 4 of these creative player different ones none of the seem to last i just do not want to buy an ipod so i keep giving these people a play but not any more
5,More better than the Ipod video,"I love my Zen vision M. Its the better media player i ever had (it's better than my ipod video).Pros : The sound is excellent. The screen is amazing. The controls are easy to operate. Very easy to transfer media archives and you can make play lists very fast.It has radio FM inside. And this can support many more video formats than the ipod video. Also the battery life is 2 times more durable then the ipod video.Con: They should sell Bigger capacity of Zen. ( 60 or 80GB for my videos). There is no games options, and i dont know if i can make run some extra programs (linux ) in the Zen like my ipod"
3,Zen broke within 3 months of having it,"I really like the features of the zen alot... That is why I gave it a 3. My Zen had a hard disk failure. It is currently being worked on by Creative Labs and their service has been great (antoher reason it earned a 3). The reason I am writing this review is to let people know that this ""hard disk failure"" is a ""somewhat common"" problem. I found out about that when I did some forum searches regarding my players symptoms. Great product when I was able to use it though...UPDATE: (4 stars) I sent my zen in for repair. They sent back a new one. It was a hardisk failure. They replaced it for a $25 handling fee. Great customer service at Creative Labs."
2,It was great when it worked,"Hi. I went through two of these and I'm sad to say, I had problems with both of them. I had the first one about a month and a half before it started acting up. It froze during a song and it just went downhill from there. I tried resetting it but to no avail. I returned it to the store (not Amazon) and they were nice enough to exchange it for me. Just my luck, the replacement froze up the next day. I am now just going to return it for a refund and try something else. When my units were working, I loved them. They worked great. I was just unlucky I guess that I had problems. And no, I didn't drop them or bang on them or abuse them in any way. Thanks."
4,Pleasant Player,"I'll make this short and sweet - the Zen Vision: M is terrific!I'm techo challenged and resistent to newfangled gadgets but I enjoy this quality mp3 player. I did a good deal of info digging and comparrison shopping before settling on this 30GB audio and video player. I appreciate the easy to use and gigantic screen design. I love the terrific sound quality. The digital photo display is fantastic. This is an overall outstanding mp3 player.I despise the iPod. I dislike the scroll wheel navigation especially. I also resent the overwhelming presence of iPod. It seems ""popular"" and I'm not into status symbols. Besides, the Creative Zen offers so much more. It's clunkier looking than the sleek iPod Nano and such but it packs a lot of good features.As I said, I'm keeping this review brief. The botttom line is I really enjoy this fabulous player and think it's currently the best deal. It's worth a good look if you're looking around for a nice, multi-functioning player. I love it!"
3,zen mp3 player,"It is a beautiful item, however it didn't come with clear instructions and I am having trouble downloading. It downloads very slowly and sometimes incompletely"
4,Should have bought the 60GB,"Was initially frustrated in using the Zen. The controls seemed to be either overly sensitive or not responsive at all. Within a day I was getting used to it and now I'm very happy and impressed with its operation. After ripping about half of my CD's on Windows Media Player, I've discovered the 30 GB capacity on the Zen is not going to be enough. I use my Zen in my car (using the casette method). I've connected all of my audio systems in my house to the Zen. With hundreds (thousands) of songs and using the shuffle feature, this is a great way to listen to my collection of music. I really like the idea of cataloging all of my music. Ear plugs are a negative as well as the instruction booklet. Otherwise, I think the Zen is Great!"
4,"Great Player, Ipod better whatch its back",I am very happy with my unit. The ease of file transfer is wonderful. The touch pad is a very cool addtion and the brightness of the screen makes my ipod fanatic friend to doublethink his admiration for the ipod.The only problem with the zen vision m is that it tends to freeze every once in a while but with a simple restart it comes back to life.I'm a very happy bunny
2,"""Device not recognized""","Prospective buyers, beware!I did a lot of research, and finally settled on the Creative Zen Vision:M. I was certainly impressed when it arrived, it is handsome and the player itself is easy to figure out, with gorgeous sample photos and videos to admire as I installed the software.When I finally plugged the ZVM into my PC, an alert came up, ""Device malfunction, not recognized."" Since then, I've spent 12+ hours researching the internet, downloading fixes, firmware updates, driver updates, etc., to no avail. I am an average PC user, but common solutions include meddling around in the registry and completely re-installing windows XP. I haven't been brave enough to do either of those yet.I do believe the ZVM will be fantastic when I get it to communicate with my computer, it has such great reviews. I just want everyone to be aware that mine is a common problem, as demonstrated on Creative's Support website. Don't be dissappointed if it happens to you."
4,Great player,"Had this player for a few days. Previously had the Zen Sleek. This is a great model. The screen is unbelievable and the navigation is very easy/clear. They really did a nice job with the touch pad this time. It has a great feel. It also works flawlessly with Yahoo Music Unlimited. My only complaint is that the buttons around the scroll pad are very, very stiff. Perhaps this is unique to my player. But it is a little annoying having to press down so hard."
5,Impressive music/video player,"I have had several friends who have owned iPod's and without fail, every one of them have broken with in the first year. So when I decided to buy this type of player, I looked around and saw that all the reviews and comments I had seen were very positive for the Zen Vision M (most rated it much higher than the iPod). One of the main reasons I wanted a player like this was to store my photos since I am also an amateur photographer. The resolution on the Vision M was great as was the sound. I also liked the idea of having a radio as well as a recorder. I bought my Vision M in October of 2005. I bought my wife one for Christmas 2006, and she loves it! The only issue I have is that the battery is not replaceable and there sre not nearly as many cool accessories as the iPod has. But I have had my player for over a year and take it to the gym and work and in my car, I have had zero problems with it. (Both were purchased from Amazon, where I found the best price)"
1,Technical Difficulties,"When I use this MP3, I had many problems with it. Here are the problems:1. It freezes too much.(Even on the first day I used it)2. It has a slow response.3. When I reset the Zen, it decreases performance.4. It shakes to much.5. If accidentally dropped, makes the reader for the disk busted.6. It is a disk type MP3.7. The processor is sluggish.These are the things that makes it bad.But there are actually some good feature that are very awesome.1. Big capacity.2. Good resolution screen.3. Microphone (The cause of freezing)4. Long battery life.5. Lots of featuresAs you can probably see, the cons outweigh the pros.This MP3 is a must-not buy."
1,Don't buy the Zen Vision M,"If you do a little homework by searching the various forums where this device is discussed, you'll learn that if the unit works at all, it won't work for long. It will cease to charge it's battery, and it's unlikely that you will ever get the problem resolved.Creative tech support is less than worthless! When mine stopped charging, I e-mailed Creative tech support. After a couple of days, I actually received a response... telling me to make sure it was fully charged.GRRR!!! I will NEVER EVER buy another Creative product."
5,Great user interface,"Wonderful user interface and dj mode makes this player a jewel to operate. Ripping dvds and compressing to an .avi file size is time-consuming, but within a few days you can store some of your fav. movies for replay anytime.Only downside is the manual is underwhelming, but the online forums for the anti-ipod crowd are growing. You can quickly grab neat navigation tips by just searching the forums. The included software works well, and is fairly easy to use - still, it is not as user friendly as iTunes. The tradeoff is the open architecture."
1,DO nOt buy!!!!!!!,Do NOT spend ur money on this item!! i had it a month and now it won't even come on...it is not the best player to rely on. id choose the ipod over this anyday.....please don't buy it!!!!!!
2,Quality lacking,"I got this one for Christmas. After using it for a few weeks, it's going back and getting replaced with an iPod. My wife has the iPod, and it is much easier to use than the Creative. The Creative certainly is not as easy to use as the iPod, and it also feels as though it is not made as well. You can pretty much tell after using them side-by-side that this is Creative's attempt at copying the iPod. They do a good job of making it look similar, but it just doesn't stack up to the quality of the iPod."
1,no Mac compatibility,"equals no sale. Closed system that excludes me is more ""proprietary"" than iTunes/iPod combo. You are not forced to use iTunes to use your iPod, any CD can be ripped to it. You are not forced to use a particular OS for your computer either, with an iPod. Not so with this wanna-be. Zen-casting? give me a break!no zero star option available"
1,This is a waste of money!,"My freind bought one of these thinking it was gonna be cool, but then he later returned it because it didnt come with software, and instead he bought a iPod which was a good investment!"
5,LOVE IT!!!,"I purchased this for my husband last Father's day, and was so jealous I begged for one for Christmas. I LOVE it!!! I've loaded all my favorite CD's, and still have 19 GB leftover for all my pictures. Don't be fooled into thinking the IPod is the greatest MP3 player.... this one sounds and feels great!"
5,Great MP3 Player.,I got this for my 13 year old son for Christmas and he just loves it. he wanted an alternative MP3 player to an ipod and after a great deal of research he decided on the Creative Zen Vision M.He has downloaded his complete cd collection very easily and quickly plus video's and other media. It is easy to use and has a larger screen than some of the other players. The sound is very clear and the system itself is very sturdy. I am very pleased with this purchase.
4,So far so good,"I got the item today and charged it up and put songs on it. It plays great. Also the screen is very sharp. The fact that you can put your own pictures on the backgroud is a must. The headphones are nice but they don't always fit into peoples ears. My creative came with the most up to date firmware. THe only reason it is not a five is the small hookup. I am guessing the reason is so the could fit everything inside the player. I am happy with this so far. The product was also not in stock. However, Amazon changed the shipping from 9 day to 2 day to get it here on time. This was truely amazing. Once shipped it was here very fast. Good job Amazon!"
4,I love it,"I bought my wife the pink and myself the blue Zen Vision M. It does everything I hoped for and more. The picture is clear, the sound is great. FM reception is very good. Recording functions for both FM and voice are easy to use.The Zen does not yet have the plethora of accessories that currently support Ipod, but more accessories are available every week.This was a fantastic purchase. The fact that I saved money on Amazon only sweetens the deal."
1,No AC Adapter..poor video support.,"The version sent does not have the previously included AC adapter. Some Call this the Zen Vision Lite version.The support for various video files is less robust than many report.If the video is above 2500 mbps total or beyond 320 by 240 (!!) then the software demands transcoding.It is the slowest transcoder in existance...be prepared to wait hours and hours and hours for a movie.It will therefore likely cost $$ to bring this up to speed. First, a case to protect from scratches and a kickstand so you can see video on the screen. Secondly, a wall adapter. About $60 more.The internal battery is not removable. 500 charge cycles are the maximum for Li-Ion of this type. The player is likely to be worthless in just over a year (since the charge capacity decreases over time). That is a pretty expensive toy.I am not impressed."
1,Great For 90 Days,"Beware of Creative products!The glowing reviews here are based upon people that have just received their new toy. Ask them what happens between 90 days and one year. The durability of Creative products is extremely poor. Why do you think they only warrant the product for 90 days, after which you pay all labor to fix it? You can expect Creative products to fail after 90 days.Think of quality in Mp3 players as being demonstrated by the manufacturer's warranty. Look at Microsoft's Zune and Apple's iPod. They both offer a full one-year warranty. That means that they believe their products are built well enough to last at least one year. Creative has no more confidence in their product than 3-months!These devices do stop functioning very easily. The $50-$100 you think you are saving by buying a Creative product is quickly lost trying to repair it in less than a year."
1,"It looks really cool, but I haven't been able to see on yet.","I have bought a creative zen vision:m through amazon. I was promised one in 2-3 days. It has been over three weeks and the delivery date has now changed to make it 5 weeks. I just want you people out there to know that if you want to get this item through Amazon, it will take a long time. I like Amazon.com and usually get my item by the time promised. I guess this item is going to be out of stock for a while. Do not put your hopes on the promised 1-2 weeks on the add. It will take far longer than that. I'm still waiting for mine. Hope this helps all of you who plan on getting on through amazon. Again, amazon.com is great, but this item will be out of stock for a while and they will not update their add to show that."
3,Get informed before buying!,This is a great mp3 and video player.... but even having more features than an ipod it has a great problem.... about which i found after i bought it.... I can suddendly get frozzen!!!!! there is a forum on creative.com with people who's zen had frozen.... and they couldn't solve this problem...... this happened to me but i were lucky... after a soft reset my zen got back to life.... but this might not be the rule....Again... this is a great player but look for information before buying....... besides this zen m rocks!
5,Amazing mp3 player,"This mp3 player is AMAZING; it beats the similar iPOD, hands down. It has a built in microphone/recorder which I use everyday in my classes, it has a radio for when you get bored of your own music. The images are sharp and clear, sound is terrific (even better if you have their noise-canceling earphones!). It has NEVER frozen on me, NEVER done anything unexpected. Once, I accidentally deleted my own library, but it was entirely my fault (I pressed the delete button on my computer, foolish). The maximum capacity of 8Gigs for a removable disk is great for when I need to store files for school. It's perfect!"
2,"Read ""almosthappy"" review for workaround to DOA issue","The first Zen we bought would not turn on at all. We used the Amazon return process and quickly received a replacement. In the meantime, I read the comment / review from ""almosthappy"" about how to charge the battery on a player that was Dead on Arrival. The second player was DOA as well. We followed his instructions and used a wall charger from an old CD player. Once the battery had enough charge we could boot up the player. It would be nice if Creative provided a wall charger with the MP3 player. (One can be purchased as part of a pkg with a silicone cover, and a travel and wall charger. I found them on Amazon for ~ $26.) We have three Zens in our family and so far they seem to work well. We will have to reserve judgment until more time has passed. I recommend buying a decent set of earbuds if you find the ones that came with the MP3 player to be uncomfortable."
5,The best MP3 player on the market,"I have owned an iPod and an iAudio and this BY FAR is better than anything I have seen. The picture/video quality is phenominal, and the sound quality is great. The buttons are easy to get used to (especially if you have owned an iPod). This is a true iPod killer."
2,Somewhat good,"I purchased this player in May of this year, and it has now just out of the blue started locking up on me. It includes an internal reformatting, and resetting function, which is good, but I guess I just got a bad player, because it locks up on this function as well. It's been good for the time I've used it. I've watched movies on it during flights, and I've continuously used it to listen to my favorite music while I travel, but now it's caput.I just can't believe that after only 7 months I now have to look for a new player, and now the price is higher than when I bought it. I have to get rid of this thing, and it's beyond the returns policy.I'm now leaning towards a zune. I just can't spend more money on a player that I already had that broke down on me after less than a year.I'm very upset."
5,Great MP3 Player,I took this player to Iraq with me and was able to fit all my songs and pictures on it. Was nice having a bit of home with me.
1,Worse Display Ever,"Advertising the display is the last thing creative people should consider because dispite its tiny bit higher of resolution, you won't be able to see anything under daylight. Say when you are walking on the street during the day and you wanna switch a song, I can gaurantee that you won't see a thing on the screen. The high resolution can only be seen well when you are in complete darkness. The processor is also insanly slow, can't believe this item can still exist under this kind of rediculous price!"
3,"Good unit, once it works","Upon receiving this rather pricey unit I found that it didn't work, and so, even though I had purchased an extended warranty, I had to return it to the manufacturer at a personal cost of $15. Upon receiving it back it now works well, although the documentation on how to use it is very scanty. I found I just had to experiment with it a lot to figure out how to use it optimally."
2,...,What the hell. The information about Creative Zen Version: M being able to supprt AVI format is a lie. It does not support it and I am quite mad about it.
1,Piece of crap.,"I bought this mp3 player a little over a month ago and have used it 4 times. I've kept it in a small case to keep it perfectly safe. Haven't dropped it, haven't left it sitting or anything. Now I went to use it the 5th time and it either A shuts down after 5 seconds or B makes my headphones sound like they're full of water. I've tried using different headphones, I've tried replacing the battery. Nothing works. I am veeerrryyy dissapointed in this product. It was a TOTAL WASTE of money. I strongly advise NOT purchasing it."
3,I've Owned Nothing But Creative Products,"The Good:I've had the Vision: M since June of 2007 and it is EXTREMELY durable, I've dropped it more times than I can remember and it shows no ill effects. I take it into the sauna with me after workouts at the gym, again no problems. Sounds great, it has a customizable EQ feature, a ""bass boost"", and a ""smart volume"" so all your tracks will be the same level. (IE, so older tracks play at the same level as newer ones).The not as good:The older it gets, the quicker the battery drains (maybe that's with all mp3 players?). You can't use just any USB cable to connect it to your computer, it comes with an adapter that you have to have to attach to the cable so if you lose it, you're screwed. If you fill it up too close to the 30 GB limit it will start locking up on you.If you put video on it, it seems like even at full volume it's still a little lower than I would expect something at full volume to be.Overall, this is certainly a good media player for the price."
4,Great product but customer support from company sucks!,I've had this mp3 for three years and I love it.My problem has been with customer support; my FM turnner does not work any more and the battery doesn't stay charged as long as it did when new. I tried to contact the company to see if they could replace the fm and battery and they won't return my e-mails. what's the big deal? All I want to know is if it can be done. Any help out there?L
5,Perfect!,"Finally a player that I can use everywhere. It is extremely easy to use with a PC and accepts tons of file types. The screen is beautiful. I would suggest getting an InvisibleShiled for it though, since it does scratch easily."
4,Great player; marginal video ripping software,"I love this unit (my third MP3/video player), but ripping videos from DVDs using the supplied software just doesn't work well. After several tries (unsuccessful) with Creative support, I bought a copy of Xilisoft DVD Ripper 4.0. It rips the DVDs easily, using intuitive controls, creating a format compatible with the unit. You can then easily transfer the ripped file to the unit, and voila, your music concert, movie, or whatever you want will be there for you to play while traveling, etc. I use my unit with Bose Quiet2 earphones on planes to avoid engine noise, passenger noise, etc., and to have something relaxing to watch. I use Jack the MP3 Ripper (a shareware program that is great and easy to use) to rip MP3s to install in the unit."
5,one of the best purchases,This thing is awesome. It plays mp3s very well and also video. i've thrown different types of video and it plays it very nicely. the radio is a great feature and a better feature is being able to record it. it also has mic recording so i can record lectures or other things. the only thing missing is line-in recording. that would make this the perfect player..
3,Nice when it works,"I've had mine for close to 2 years and when it works it's pretty good, video is very nice, it's all very nice, but only when it works! Too many times it has frozen up on me and I've needed to restart it and it gets annoying, especially when I'm working out and don't want to leave to get a small pin to restart it with!"
4,Worth every penny,"This device is so much better then the iPod, I has many features that the iPod dose not and I have always been a big fan of Creative Labs. They have been doing sound longer then any computer company out there."
5,"Geek Approved, you should consider getting it!","This is the best portable media player out as of yet. Here's why you should get this instead of an ipod...Ipod is all about restricting you. You must download all songs/vids from ONE computer, and cannot transfer them to another, and it is format specific... It must be in apple format... BOO.I have 3 pc's, and I sometimes move songs from my laptop to a desktop... NO RESTRICTIONS WITH CREATIVE. It caters to more files, and doesn't try to play 'big brother' and be your conscience by limiting what you can and cannot download and transfer between the unit and your other pcs.So, it has the speed, look and feel of an ipod, is compatable with more file types for both audio and video, and it won't try to be your moral guide by limiting what you can transfer and what type of file.Enjoy!"
2,Pick Quality over Quantity,"It makes me sad to have to give a bad review, but I am just telling it how it happened. I bought this Zen through another store, and was so excited to get it in. When I got it, I think it was a defective player, because it kept not turning off when I wanted it to, and I had had it less than 24 hours. The screen also started freezing up when I wanted to fastforward. The player itself was old, it said it was made in 2005, so I don't know how the newer ones are. I am going to get a better quality player even though it is more expensive."
2,NO AC ADAPTER,"Creative has removed the AC adapter from the included items, and the only place where Amazon mentions it is in the detailed tech info. I feel cheated.I dont know why Creative would do such a thing.., when all along they were trumpetting the valuse for money vis a vis iPod."
2,Do not buy this...it only worked for a few months.,"I bought this product thinking it would be a great replacement to the Ipod I used to have. At the beginning it was excellent, the FM tuner is great. I used it at the gym everyday for at least 1 hour, for 3 months or so... Then one day the player would not turn on... I read that if I would connect it for a couple of hours and it would work again, I followed that advice and it did work for 2 days... the 2 days past and the MY ZEN M DIED.... it has turned on once since then, but just for a couple of minutes, funny thing... is that during the those few minutes that it was on the battery was totally full as well.Anyway.... please do not waste your time or money with this product."
3,"Good, but needs to be better","video freezes up not infrequently, forcing you to completely restart the device (which takes about 5 minutes). The navigation is unintuitive and awkward. Very good equalizer options though and good sound."
1,DONT BUY IT!!!!,"I completely regret purchasing this item. I had this product for a month in a half before opening the box. When I opened the box and started using the item, it broke. It wouldnt turn on and when I contacted customer service it was just grief. That is after an employee of the award winning customer service hung up on me the first time. When I then called back and spoke to a manager, he misinformed me of their policy and waited a month to return the deffective product. I wish I never purchased this product. You would think after they sold me expensive, and deffective equipment they would go out of their way to replace it or fix it, but they didnt. I would not encourage anyone in buying thid product and I wish I never did. It was a birthday gift and it came back to smack me in the face"
2,Wish I'd bought a video Ipod,"The Vision:M is a decent little player - except for the ""little"" part. 30GB for a video/mp3 unit is not enough, especially when the Video IPOD offers 60GB - 2x the drive space - for $50 more. After loading my average size song collection of 15GB, my Vision M has only enough room for about 2 - 3 hours of MPEG-2 (TIVO) video.Creative would have been better off leaving out the seldom used FM and digital dictation functionality, and putting a properly sized hard drive to serve the core MP3/Video purpose."
2,Hardware is only 1-4th the equation,"While the Zen is a decent size and does everyting well, and nothing poorly, it is the software that really bothers me.Microsoft has left Plays For Sure in the dust due to Zune. In other words, don't count on PFS and WMA getting a big boost in technology creativity any time soon.Apple's iPod really has the most seamless solution, and for a few bucks more, you won't be regretting your decison...Don't be ""penny-wise and pound-foolish"" just go with the most seamless solution on the market. I recently moved to iPod-iTunes and the overall use - now I know why 60% percent of the people use it!"
1,TERRIBLE,"I have had this unit for two days now. I bought it for a road trip, and the first thing i did on the road trip was try to watch a movie and the player froze. It stayed froze and there was no way of turning it off except either, wait for the battery to run out, or push the reset button. Since i was on a road trip the reset button wasnt an option and the battery didnt run out until we were done driving. The second time i used the M I was scrolling through menus and it froze for the second time in two days that i had it. I either got an extremelly faulty unit or this product needs major work. Get yourself an ipod, it costs the same amount, but at least you know your getting a product you can trust."
3,No Fast Forward button,"My preferred use for this player is to use the ""Random Play All"" feature - that way I can have fun listening to a surprising music list of the 14,128 songs I have loaded. Unfortunately, when it is in the 'Random Play All' mode - there is no FastForward button if by chance a song plays that I don't want to listen to at that time.Rather - hitting the upper left button simply re-loads all the tracks and re-starts the Random Play All. I wish it just had FastForward like my 60GB Creative ZenXtra has."
2,Disappointed,"I have owned my Creative Zen Vision:M 30GB for 10 months. I was disappointed with the stability of the product, support, and integration with software. I have now decided to purchase an ipod and retire this unit. I have experienced intermittent problems causing the unit to hang during the power up process. I suspect it has to do with the hard drive. I have been gentle with the unit so I am surprised the drive would fail. Trying to diagnose the problem or get technical support was frustrating. Creative provides no place to call for the support I needed and limited support on their website. I felt unsupported. I eventually had to resort to googling for help. Finally, the software they provide is confusing and un-intuitive. I used Microsoft Media Player to manage the Zen which was only average to this purpose.On the positive side, I like the size, the battery life, and the quality of the screen. The touch pad controls were too sensitive at times."
4,Nice Player But Confusing User Interface,"I bought this for my daughter and it sounds real nice. However, the user interface is pretty confusing. The included manual is useless which makes matters worse. The touch pad is *way* too sensitive. I couldn't turn down its sensitivity enough to stop false selections. The software is not bad but I think Rio's is a lot easier to use. In the end my daughter reports that she's got the hang of it and is very happy. I guess I may just be too used to the Rio players."
5,Zen Vision: M what the ipod aspires to be.,"I am a firm believer in the Vision. It gives new meaning to easy to use and versitile MP3 and video players. Not only is it compatible with any computer, but it can be used as a second hard drive or a jump drive if needed. Longer battery life, longer lasting, Easier interface. All combine for a Big thumbs up."
4,Definitely a good competitor against the Ipod,"Im very satisfied with this player. The audio quality sounds great and it holds plenty of music and video. It doesnt scratch to easily and feels sturdy. Avi support is a godsend and it plays videos very well. The color is great, so is the battery life.There are just a couple of cons. The stock software doesnt manage album art. If a track is not tagged with an album, its invisible in the album section even though it shows the artist. The conversion software for videos straight up does not work for anything, neither does it give an intuitive answer as to why. Just use windows media player 11 and everything works perfect. The player locked up two or three times but that was fixed with the firmware."
2,Brand new & wouldn't take a charge,"Well, I purchased the Creative Zen Vision:M on 5/09/07 and when it came a week later the box was in perfect condition, however, the unit would not take a charge. It did not display any charging icons or any life at all. I left it overnight on (2) different computers charging via the USB cable. I even went out and bought an A/C wall charger, all to no avail. I have requested that Amazon ship me a replacement unit. At this point, I don't fault anyone, I just want a unit that works. I will post an update once I get the new one."
2,"Harddrive Crash after 90 days, other reviews same problem","Player only Says ""HARDDRIVE PROBLEM"" Worked fine for 90 days then crashed, Now being charged $25.00 to have it looked at by Creative labs, since it is after 90 days. It's says 1 year warranty, but after 90 you have to pay $25.00 to get it fixed. Still cheap. Tech support took over 48hrs to reply, and when they did they try to sell you stuff for a broken player. This is in the tech email. ""Please be patient and we'll figure this out. In the meantime, feel free to visit our website and see the entire line of accessories that we have for the Zen Vision:M. They will definitely help you get the most of your music experience. Here is the link""The only thing the Zen has going for it and why 2 stars is the picture is nice and clear. Will not buy any creative labs again, this is the 3rd product, the others being speakers, all have broken or poorly manufactured. I have had better luck with lower end products."
2,Not Good,"I purchased this product December of 2006. I got it and was very very pleased with it. Video, Music, Pictures, FM radio, FM radio recording was all good, never used the microphone.After about 4-5 months after purchasing this product, I went to charge and add music to the player and the USB cord could not be recognized by my computer. I have read reviews of this happening and still decided to purchase it anyway......WRONG MOVE. Everything I tried that the tech support told me to do via email because your phone support help expires after 30 days I believe did not help. Luckily I purchased from Amazon and was able to return it but with a 15% restocking fee deducted from my refund.I don't know if its just the Creative Zen Vision: M that has this problem but I suggest that you do not buy this product to find out.DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT."
2,No Zen Here !!,"Pretty in pink although a bit bulky in size, screen is great, tap bar is often unresponsive then becomes too sensitive and too many freeze ups."
2,Not happy,"When I got it, I downloaded 3000 songs easily. I went back to download more and the computer would not recognize the USB cable. I tried 4 different computers and 3 different cables, no dice. I tried calling customer service and I got hung up on several times and then got a busy tone (it is a 1-300 number) The only other thing is a discussion forum. I downloaded all the new drivers and programs that it said to do..still doesn't work. This is a great product as far as sound, visuals etc, but if it breaks or doesn;t work, be prepared for some crappy customer service."
3,Amazon - 5 stars,"Nice unit. Works seemlessly with Media Center. Plenty of capacity. Nice, but easily scratched, screen. However, the Zen just stopped working one day due to an apparent software issue. No rhyme, no reason. Creative wasn't much help. They did suggest I contact Amazon. Amazon did replace it 3 months after purchase,to my surprise, with absolutely no hassle. I would have given this unit 5 stars had Creative been more responsive to the problem. Knowing what I know now I doubt I would buy a Zen Vision M again."
1,Not Worth It,"I got this for my daughter after a few problems with an IPOD that she had for two years. Well, the Zen here worked for about 10 minutes and we're two days and waiting for customer support at Creative. When she received it for Christmas, she told me that it didn't work. Thinking that she didn't have it set up correctly, I finally had some time to work with it this past weekend (April). Well, she was right, it doesn't work. Loaded everything, got it in sync and then it promptly froze in recovery mode with the computer software saying that it isn't plugged in since it's in recovery mode. Catch 22!!!! Find another brand, it can't be any worse."
5,Easy to Use,"I have really enjoyed my Creative vision so far. I have only had for little less then a week, but already I think it is great. The main reason that I chose the Creative Zen Vision instead of the iPod was because I can use any music service and I am not tied to the iTunes. The rip software that is provided with the Zen is so easy to use (and I am not a tech person at all); I ripped all my cd's (600+ songs) in a matter of a few hours and the synch process was very easy. I had no desire to throw it out the window and I have had this urge with every other mp3 player I have owned. The other great feature is that it has an fm tuner; which is helpful if you want to listen to the radio at the gym or somewhere. The screen resolution and sound quality are great as well. If found the touch pad very easy to use, although I have no experience with the iPod for comparison."
1,Unreliable,"I bought one of these for my mother. She used it very lightly(ie 20 times or less over a year). Just over a year after it was bought(and shortly after the warranty expired), it got corrupted and the recovery software from creative doesn't help.I have a somewhat high computer/technical experience and normally can recover gadgets like this.Save some aggrivation and buy a Zune or iPod instead"
1,Unreliable piece of trash,"I started off really liking this product. Then the problems started. The player would hang, then freeze completely and wouldn't even let me turn it off. I had to use a bent paper clip to press the reset button over and over again. After about eight months of use, the player wouldn't turn on unless you charged it overnight, and God forbid if you let it go to sleep mode. Eventually, after about 11 months, it died completely.And forget getting assistance from Creative Labs. They won't even speak to you over the phone; you have to run the gauntlet of their unintuitive web site, and they won't deal with you at all if the product is out of warranty.11 months isn't long enough for a product even one-eighth the cost of this piece of garbage. Save your money and don't buy Creative."
2,Great features but BIG problems with the hard drive,"I have owned two, first shut down after 2 or so months, had it replaced because of serious problems in the hard drive, and misplaced my second around here somewhere. Considered getting a third, but I'm quickly reminded of my frustrations with the first Vision:M. I know it's too much of an investment again on my end for a device that may or may not be working in the next 3 months. Easy to navigate (dummy-proof Windows format), with tons of space, great clarity, colors and all the works...if it decides to work when you're ready to use it. Look elsewhere for all these features BUT with a more stable hard drive."
1,"Prone to defects, poor support provided by Creative","With all its bells and whistles, the Zen Vision M is an amazing alternative to an iPod--when it works.While not every unit is plagued with problems, many of them are...A month after buying it, the FM radio spontaneously stopped working. Well within the warranty, I sent it back to Creative for repair and got a brand new model a few weeks later.Shortly after the year mark had passed (and thus the warranty ending), the unit randomly started malfunctioning--freezing up, displaying only a black screen, resetting wouldn't work, even formatting the hard drive didn't do anything. Outside the warranty, the cost to fix it? The same price as a new model.Creative does not support their defective units. All one has to do is browse the Creative forums to see how many other people have experienced this same issue...Avoid Creative--get an iPod. They supposedly last."
3,it's good while it lasts,"I wish I could tell you that I have been completely satisfied with my Zen Vision M. I bought mine in October 2006 and started having problems in January 2007. Apparently, I ""dropped"" it, damaging the hard drive. This completely ruined it? It would not start up and merely went to the opening screen. I had to pay an additional $100.00 to have it fixed and had to wait over 1 month to have receive it back. After being aggitated by that, around a month later, now, the same thing happens again, except I know for a FACT i did not drop it. All of the options in the Recovery Mode of the player do not work, for me at least. I am not looking forward to sending it back again, and I definetly wish now that I had gone with my first instinction and bought and IPOD. Maybe I will switch over to it now..The player was great while it lasted, but it is not trustworthyenough if you are an avid listener."
3,It's okay.,"I think this player is okay. However, I find that maybe one in every ten songs that I play on it have a horrible static noise accompanying the song. This is fixed by restarting the song, but it still annoys the hell out of me.I'm also rather upset with the video capabilities. I wasn't aware that if you rip a dvd into too high of quality that it wouldn't be able to play on it. Hell, it won't even let you transfer it onto the player. [And reformatting it takes FOREVER when you're dealing with a movie.]Other than these cons that I've mentioned, I really do like this player. It hasn't gotten frozen during playback as of yet, and is generally a very nice player."
3,"Great non-Ipod MP3 player, but...","I bought this MP3 player for my husband as a surprise for his birthday. He loved it. The only problem was that after 3 days there appeared horizontal lines on the display screen. The company provided a few suggestions to fix it, but they didn't work. We returned it to Amazon - no problems, full refund received in a very short amount of time. We have purchased a replacement item at a store. So far, it is great.My husband loves the large hard drive - 30 GB for a price that is a few dollars more than 4 GB or 8 GB. Video is a bit hard to figure out how to import. Other than that, a good machine."
4,Great MP3 player for the price,"I have been looking for a MP3 player for some time and finally decided to go with Creative Zen Vision:M 30GB and haven't regretted the decision. The files have transferred very nicely and the software for organizing data seems to work really well. I have had no problems at all with ripping, syncing or transferring any of the files to the Vision:M. One problem that I have, and the only reason I did not give this five stars, is that the touch scroll device is very ""touchy"". Although there is a way to ""tune"" the sensitivity I still find the pad to be to sensitve. Great features, love the option to use FM (yes, I still enjoy listing to the radio sometimes) and having this option is just an added bonus. Great screen resolution and pretty user friendly. All in all I would recommend this player."
1,Horrible Sound Quality,"After my COWON iAudio X5L 30 GB broke, I decided to go with something new for an MP3 player, and after sufficient research, I read that Creative Zen Vision:M was the best player on the market, even rated ""best in show"" by CNet. However, after receiving the thing, despite it's beautiful display - the sound quality is HORRIBLE...even if you play with the Custom EQ the bass is lacking, if you turn bass boost on the sound gets distorted, and no special effects or surround sound options are available.Do not buy this product...the beauty of it may be nice but is a superficial reason to purchase a player. At the end of the day, you want the player to sound great and function well. Go with the COWON iAudio X5L 30 GB, which has 35-hour battery and THE best sound quality of all the currently available MP3 players on the Net."
2,Creative Zen Vision M Problem Not Turning On or Off Lights stay on,"My wife just got the Creative Zen Vision M last week, but we have a problem already, the Zen doesn't want to turn On or Off. But all the lights are On, so the company is sending us a new one :-( try to fix the problem reset don't work try all) no luck! But it is to new to find any problems on the web. Hope we have no problems with the new one.Ps. Sorry for the spelling"
4,MP3 Player IPod Alternative,It works with everything but ITunes. This means you transfer your old music if you have another MP3 player besides an IPod. Slightly thicker then IPod but still very compact. Easy to use but some short cuts would be nice. It still has same digital rights media limitations as all the other mp3 players. I like the Ven Vision Series computer interface software. The random play is as limited as all other players. You have to select the starting song which means you will probabaly here the first song in your play list alot. Still it sounds good and works well with my car radio 3mm plug in and my home stereo 3mm plug in.
4,Lives up to the positive feedback.,"What can I say? So far so good. The unit lives up to the positive feedback it has received. I still need to get a good set of headphones for this thing because if you like bass in your music like I do, you will find the earbuds that are provided with the unit woefully inadaquate. I listen to mostly rock/metal music. The ability to adjust the sound via the EQ feature is a nice touch lacking on my wife's IPOD mini. I know I am comparing apples to oranges here but that is my only exposure to the ipod. I have converted one DVD over to Divx and it looks NICE on this little color screen. FYI, I converted over Miami Vice to Divx format and it ended up being 1.26GB in size. I will probably need to play with the compression a little bit to get it smaller.I may post another review once I have owned the unit a little longer but this is it so far. Overall, I highly recommend this player. So far."
1,Hi,"Becare full before u consider buying a IpodDVDS problems getting to player.Itunes have have Remote problems.Ipod Plays Monopoly & its ILigal.U will be Upset one u buy it because it a new tecnology.Be care full not to hook your Ipod up to nother comuter or all music will be Erased.If Itunes Libary has no CD music and u hook it up it it could be Erased.be carefull a virus dosent crash your computer or music is gone.If u erase your PC and start brand new it can cause Ipod to erase atamatically if Itune libary is emty, U dont get a wall charger, The CD installation is poop. U get 1 USB port charger and its new type charger, the usb port jack on pc is where u charge, Laptop battery drain faster, even if u plug laptops in the wall, I have theese problems"
4,"some plus, some minus","I use this for audio books, and love the battery length and the fact that I can get a huge library on it. I am still finding the controls confusing: bookmarking seem almost random in whether it ""takes"" or not. I don't know how much this is me not absorbing directions or how much it is a problem with the touchpad. But I will say, the controls are far from intuitive."
1,On off switch was defective and unit had a lots of scratches,"On off switch was defective and unit had a lots of scratches, the unit came with bad defective power on switch, not satisfied at all with the conditiion the unit was."
4,"Great price, menu navigation could be much better","While I love the fact that I can use this with my Yahoo music account and save $1000's over iTunes, the audio output is better than my iPod and is of a better build quality... the only thing that really lets this audio player down is the menu navigation. Which is a real shame as it's something they could fix by enabling the 'left' button to consistently work as the 'back' button instead of the specific 'previous' button in the bottom left hand corner.Great player, will be awesome with a minor software tweak (which I have to assume they are working on)."
4,Very Happy with MP3 player,"I had several other MP3 players and I like this one just fine, controls are a little touchy with a slight learning curve to use correctly (this zen M works differently from my zen micro-photo)so I had to read a little .instead of just pushing a button to activate something you have to swipe you finger across it to the right, which is sort of stupid and I'd prefer just to press a button but other then that I cant complain about anything..sounds fine, works fine"
1,Pass on this piece of garbage! You will regret it otherwise!,"This product is defective! It doesn't work and there's absolutely no guaranty process to take care of this.We bought this product in Dec 07 and after 1 month of using it very sporadically it froze! There was nothing we could do to get it back on.Took it to the store and got it replaced just fine.New unit froze in less than a month later! Store refuses to replace it and sent us to the manufacturer. Manufacturer doesn't provide a process to replace this piece of garbage!If you are in the market for something like this, pass on this garbage! You will be sorry if you don't.By the way, there's no way to take the battery out and reset it. You are out of options on this garbage! Please, please pass on this.Thanks for your patience. Good luck on your search!"
1,never again !,"i purchased this product for my daughter for christmas. what a mistake.. after appoximately two months this expensive novelty stopped working. we sent it back to creative lab, that took a month, once it was returned, the same problem exists. not charging and not being able to download music"
3,Needs improvement in navigation,A product is only as good as its usability. The main menu is difficult to access. It is also difficult to get to other parts of the libraries. Over all navigation is poor.
4,Good,"I think this is a good product. I like the various settings it has such as the radio, voice recorder, photos, and video option. My creative vision m came in about 2 days even though I picked the free shipping and when it arrived it was easy to use and install."
5,Awesome older MP3 alternative to Apple's iPOD which is still functioning when bought in Feb 2007 now in Dec. 2012,"Awesome older MP3 alternative to Apple's iPOD. It is still functioning when bought in Feb 2007 now in Dec. 2012. The FM radio and MIC features made me pick this MP3 player in 2007.I did not experience the same quality with 2 purchases of Creative Lab's Zen Stone Plus (2GB) which did not seem to last longer than 2 years even when I used this Zen Vision M daily and the Zen Stone Plus only when working out. Thus, I now use an iPod Nano 6th Gen for fitness training.Disadvantage:It keeps syncing duplicates of existing songs even when I turned that feature off on the device and on my Windows Computer."
2,Creative Vision M300,"The product is much tinier than pictures of it indicate. Next, the product comes with a small user manual, but the product doesn't work like the user manual says it is supposed to. For example, the user manual/Quick Start Guide tells users to navigate (which doesn't work so well) to ""Documentation,"" but there doesn't seem to be any documentation on the device. I found some documentation on Creative's web site, but the directions on that documentation also can't be done on the Vision M300 device. Also, the what directions I could make work tell users to open and rely upon Windows Media Player to sync and organize their tunes, but the Windows Media Player doesn't work well either. So, I would not buy this product again and will probably hesitate before buying on Amazon or buying from Creative again."
3,"Nice player, but won't play M4V files","I bought this player mostly for the video feature. The screen is very clear and the radio and audio quality are very good. I was, however, very disappointed to find it won't play or even convert M4V (Quicktime) formatted files. This file format is commonly found on ITunes (large selection) and is available from Creative's own Zencast service. The Creative software that came with the player will convert different file formats, but not M4V. Creative's recommended solution is for the user to buy 3rd party software (additional cost) and convert it (time consuming) before loading it to the Zen Vision:M."
4,Awesome colors + Graphics!,"For Christmas i got my very first mp3 player! When i opened the box the first thing that came to my mind was awesome it looks like a Ipod! (Thats a big up for me) I tryed to turn it on but it didn't WORK! I was a lil sad. But after working on it it turned ON! Yay! Yes it did freeze once, But it hasn't done it again. So if your thinking about getting a mp3 player GET A Zen Vision:M, you will love it and to tell you the turth its way better than an IPOD! better graphics! the screen on the zen's look almost like a tv screen so nice! SO! what are you waiting for?!?!!?! go out and BUY IT!!!!"
1,Buy An IPOD,"Mine died 4 days out of the One Year Warranty. However the labor warranty is only 90 days it cost money to get repaired no matter what after 90 days.Not a typical warranty policy compared to the other big players in the MP3 player field.Check out the Apple or Microsoft products and you will see a One Year Warranty, parts and labor.What a waste"
5,The first true iPod Killer,"This Player is great. The folks at Creative, or third parties, should not lose the momentum and must start offering accesories for this Player."
4,I <3 IT,OK...so the touch pad is a little sensitive. I don't usually find this to be an issue unless I'm in a moving vehicle or something. It is very easy to use the screen display is amazing. The sound output is great! I am very pleased with it.
3,cost of replacement battery 30 M,"If your unit is out of warranty, it will cost you $80 plus shipping and handling to replace the battery.If your unit is still in warranty, $25 for labor cost to replace the battery."
2,Wasn't useful,This was too analytical and not real world applicable as a resource for managers I hoped to use in a training class.
5,Not Only Great for the Interviewer but also for the Interviewee,"This book is easy to pick up and understand what behavioral interviewing is all about. For someone that is at the other end of the interview process (the interviewee) this book helped to better prepare me for the interview process in this day and age. Interviews no longer entail just talking about your experience. A potential employer needs more information about a person in a short period of time. By reading ""High-Impact Interview Questions"" I feel more confident knowing what a potential employer could be looking for and what kind of quetions they may be asking. For the price, this book is well worth it!"
5,Soul stirring music with lyrics far from cliche,"It seems like the only place in Christian music that does not continually rehash the same phrases and thoughts is the alternative arena, especially since the demise of our beloved Rich Mullins. The Waiting provides the compelling feel of the alternative sound with lyrics that do more than merely fill the space between musical jams or carry the melody. I have been encouraged and challenged meditating on their lyrics during my devotional times."
1,This toy is a danger to children and should be taken off the market,"I can not believe that this toy is still on the market. Yes, kids love them and can be ohh so creative building with them. I have a preschool class that enjoyed magnetix. However from the first day we had them I noticed the little magnets all over the place, coming out of the plastic cylinders. They are defective. And, now that a 3 yr old in WA state has died from swallowing 2 magnets, and others have become severly injured, the Consumer Safety Product Commission should get a clue! It is part of many young children's nature to explore by putting things in their mouth. These magnets are breaking away from the toy with out parents noticing. They should definitely be recalled. I took them off my classroom shelves immediately."
3,In with the old...,"Life is about growth. Beattie's latest batch of characters haven't learned a damn thing since they first slumped onto the page. Park City is been there, done that (so much more alertly in earlier books.) Still, it's Beattie and a bad Beattie is better than a good - you name it."
5,WELL WORTH THE WAIT,"I was wondering is Ms. Faye had stop writing for a while. Now I know she has not. Her books may come out as quickly as others, but when they do they come out with a BANG. I found myself feeling the anquish that Mark and Nicole were putting on each. This will satisfied any reader that has read the book ""A Time for Us"". Ms. Faye please keep up the good work."
2,TOO MUCH FLUFF....NOT ENOUGH SUBSTANCE,"This is the first book I have read by Cheryl Faye and I was left wanting. The story of Nicole and Mark had potential but the telling of the story got too bogged down in I love you, No I love you, It's my fault, No it's my fault. And Nicole cried every time the wind blew the wrong way. Even Mark was teary eyed every other bad encounter. I think Nick Latargia's character could have been expanded more. And, are we really suppose to believe that the three million dollars Nicole received was from legal sources, what type of legal work did Nick do to earn that much money? I'm not giving up on you Cheryl, but I am looking for your next book to bring me back into the fold."
2,Too Long,This could have been a very good book. I think at least ten chapters could have been left off. Of all the books I've read I have never seen so much crying in my LIFE. Mark didn't have common sense and Nicole was gullible. Mark claimed he loved his wife but wouldn't keep Ashlie out of his life especially if he knows it upset Nicole. I didn't care for that hold thing with Nick what was that about. I hear that A time for us is MUCH better I'll see.
2,Follow up should have been better,"I love to read Cheryl Faye. I look for her books well in advance so I will know when to rush to the store to buy them. However, A Test of Time, proved to be too unbelievable in the story line and the characters who were so likeable and strong in the first book became hard to swallow in the 2nd book. Nicole who was such a strong female in the first book, became a weak person with a tendancy to use people. Mark, I could see losing his patience at times, but A Test of Time, made him go from a strong business man to a horny rich guy making bad decisions. The 3 million dollar scenario was so far fetched I can't even speak on that. I will say this is the only book that I have been disappointed in by Cheryl Faye and that does include the one she wroted after this. Thanks."
4,forever love.,i sincerely thought this bookk was the bomb. i enjoyed the plot inthe story and the way nicole does not let go easily. however i did not like the fact that mark was the one who had to mare all the gestures to get back together.
2,Jersey ape-man almost makes it big,"To say this guy is full of himself would be a great understatement! His world record vault with a stiff pole will NEVER be broken (everyone now uses the fiberglass pole). My hat is off to him. BUT, this guy thinks this ability was going to make him a movie star? Maybe he and the chimp would have had the same acting coach. Furthermore, as great as winning the gold medal was, people forget about you. Hello, what have you done lately? People are not going to run to get into business with you just because you are (were) Don Bragg. Sorry... at least you got to live the great American dream for a while , which is more that most can say!"
5,The Music of Christmas,This man has a God given talent!! What an artist and this album is wonderful!! It really makes you stop and think what Christmas is all about. I recommend it to everyone. Thanks Stevan Curtis Chapman for all you do.
5,Great CD,This is the best Christmas CD that I have heard in a long time. It is absolutely wonderful.
5,The Only Christmas Album You'll Ever Need,"This flawless combination of music, material, & message make this an exceptional CD.In Christmas music, all of the gifts that Steven Curtis Chapman have to share with the world conspire toachieve perfection.EVERYONE who loves music should own this album and celebrate."
5,Wow.,"This CD is very likely the best overall Christmas album -- including compilations from various artists -- that I have EVER heard. It's THAT good. Whether you're a die-hard SCC fan, a casual listener or just someone who enjoys good, quality music (especially around the holidays), this is a very, very hard album to top."
2,disapointed,I was excited to get the additional cartridges...not sure if they were used/refurbished 2ndary to good price...but I cannot access all of the songs...they just don't load and when you type song number in...it says that there is no such selectio...emailed seller my concerns but they never even responded :(
5,assuring answers to dailyl living challenges,This is a masterpiece to me.A directional material to many unsolved daily life issues.This piece has indicated the steps and what kind of prayer that needs to be adapted ie the issue or problem at hand.This material would help unfold the abundant life that Jesus came to introduce.Thank you Pastor Henry.May you release more of God's comfort to us through your books so that we can enjoy God to the fullest.God bless you plentifully.
5,ANOTHER GREAT CAGNEY FILM,"What else us there to say other than it's a Cagney film? Plenty of clever banter between him and co-star Pat O'Brien and lots of action. And you get to hear ""Garryowen"" played six times!! My favorite military tune! The Warner stock company is evident with Alan Hale, George Brent and Frank McHugh. Watch for a pre-Superman George Reeves as one of the Yanks. This is a film that can be watched over and over and over."
5,One of the greatest games in the PLANET!!!!,"My friend got this for her birthday and we played it almost all night long on her birthday party. You actually feel like u'r in the tv playing game- whether its heading soccer balls, doing kung fu or dancing! Its a really cool and fun technology and a must have for all ages and both genders. Its definitely going on my birthday and christmas wishlist this year! It is truly one of the greatest games in the planet!!!!***fine print: even this almost-perfect sounding game has its drawbacks---you have to get used to pressing buttons by waving your hands in the air which might take a while and on some of the games you can't see yourself very clearly on the screen. Also, in the dancing game (i think its called Disco stars) you have to position the camera in a very good position or sometimes the buttons don't get pressed and you don't get points.***BUT STILL, THIS GAME IS THE BEST!!!"
5,All 4 my son,I ordered this for my sson because we could not find it in the store. Little did I know that I actually saved a lot of money by ordering it here. He loves it! He actually thinks it is good exercise for him as well! It was easy enough for my 10 year old to figure out how to hook up and operate completely on his own. We are very pleased with this purchase.
4,"Fun interface, fun for family","The Eye Toy is a great interface - you and family and friends will start laughing when they see images of themselves on the screen thanks to the USB camera. It's fun to wave your arms to interact with the game instead of the controller. Always a kick when we break this out at parties. Guys like the Kung Fu and Boxing games. Girls like the Window Washing games- they will all make you sweat. I bought this along with DDR MAX2 and Karaoke Revoluion so now we have 4 ways to interact with the PS2: arm waving, dancing, singing, and regular controller. The only thing is, the graphics are a little chunky compared to most PS2 games, and the games are very simple. So this game is a good break/novelty factor for crowds with short attention spans rather than a game you'll spend hours trying to beat."
4,Excellent,Our 10 year old son just got this. It is awesome. We have enjoyed many laughs and he is getting lots of excercise. I much prefer him playing this than sitting playing a video game. It is fun for the whole family. I highly recommend this. The technology is terrific...He is so thrilled..
1,"im begging you, DONT BUY!","worst ps2 game type-thing EVER! first of all, the games that they supply (which is all that u can get) are the biggest load of crud that i have ever seen!!!!! also the resolution and gameplay of it is the worst than i have seen. ""lets go play watch the rock erode in the river"" is like new years in madison square garden compared to this.PLEASE DONT BUY THIS FOR THE SANITY AND SACREDNESS OF MAN-KIND!!"
1,?????????,"I Hate this game this gamw it sucks, all it is is a camera that you play with. I can have more fun on Microsoft Paint. When I bought it I spit on it right away. It is now my stress reliever. Theres only one good thing about the game when you play it you can see how ugly you really are."
5,Even works on a computer as a webcam!!!,My kids loving playing all the games with the PS2 and if you look online search for eyetoy drivers and this little gadget works as a webcam. I use it with Yahoo messenger and it works great... I have windows XPsp2 and you just plug it into one of your pc's USB ports and you are good to go.
1,havent recieved,id like to know where my product is it says it was attempted on april 7th but that was 2 weeks ago Ive waited patiently to receive my gift now id like to know where it is please
4,Eye Toy,"The games on Eye Toy are really cool but you can get really bored of playing some of the games over and over. Out of the 12 games you can play games by savimg your friends, playing soccor, destroying ghost,spinning plates,washing windows, boxing, being a dancing diva, and becoming a kung fu fighter. Before you start Eye Toy the game will tell you some really good tips and before each game I'd recomend reading the instructions first."
4,Family Fun,"We just purchased this game and our whole family played for a couple of hours before we got too tired and couldn't play anymore. We plan on breaking it out for Thanksgiving for all of the extended family to play and make a fool of themselves. Both kids (2 & 11) enjoyed playing a watching and I can't think of a better video game that includes the whole family working out, laughing together and enjoying eachothers company. We will be using this often and can't wait to show our friends."
3,This game is interesting!,"Eye toy is a fun game that uses a camera and captures every image it sees and puts the image on the TV.You have to use your body, not the controller.The grafics are not good and the gameplay is not to good. It's fun at first, but it will be boring after a while.there are tweleve mini games and video messaging."
4,wowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowow!WOWOWOWOWOWOWOWOW!!!!!,"this is amazing!unbelieveable!now,i'm a 10 year old and this is so cool!You should get it!now if you couldn't see yourself on the tv,it would be less fun.but you get to see yourself,and get to punch,kick,and jam!i love it!"
5,I'm really a 13 Year Old Girl,"This is an AWESOME family game! I just got back from my grandma's house and everyone there played it! By everyone, I mean everyone from my grandma to my 5 year old cousin! My cousins and I must have played this for 5 hours! We all absoulutally loved it! When we got bored on the game we where playing, we would record messages or play in the gameroom. (It has a ton of cool effects). I would definitely recommend this game! Also, it is quite an aerobic activity :D BUY THIS GAME"
4,Greatest Thing Invented for PS2,wow! i am very impressed with this new toy! it is the greatest thing that ever happened to the playstation2! it is awesome! kids love it and so do adults!
3,Decent fun..,"This ' game ' is decent fun. It's VERY innovative and capable. ( I've heard of it soon being able to hook up online and you'll be able to chat with people. ) This game is just repetetive. And a workout! There are times when at the end of the day when I played this when my arm was about to fall off. Buy this though if you want a strange, original, yet obvious idea, ' game ' . You most likely will not be too dissapointed in your first few outings with it."
3,"Interesting idea, but poor quality for the money.","The Eyetoy is an interesting idea in videogames... a camera that actually maps your movement onto the screen. I love the idea, and I love that the technology now exists. However...For the amount of money involved, Sony could have invested in a higher quality camera. The image is too fuzzy to be satisfying, the unit detects light and dark spaces poorly, and adjustment is a pain. Though the camera is a fun toy, it need stweaking before I can take it seriously as a lasting accessory."
4,Easy to use,"and I was amazed but it works exactly as described. Not hard to hook up and it tells you how to do it. I think it was good to go in under 4 mins.It wears the kids out, the adults have fun with it and the price isn't bad. I can imagine anyone not enjoying this."
5,26 yr Female enjoying games again,"I recently got this for Christmas . I uaually don't play video games, and haven't been excited about a game in awhile. However, I really enjoyed playing with this one and I was totally interacting with it physically - punching, jumping up and down, etc... However, after a few days of playing the few games it has, it can/does get tiring and boring after awhile. Playing this game is a good workout and it will keep you on your toes! Another section is the playroom this is good to veg out on or just to have on - check out bees and bubbles... I really like those."
4,Eye Toy Note,"The Game itself is very fun to play with for kids and adults especially when its used in parties, it definitely still makes a rival for modern consoles. The only thing is that some sellers placed the game ""eye toy play"" (which is the game the eye toy comes with) as the only product they are selling under this category, so if you are planning to buy this contact the seller first and make sure they are selling the game and the usb camera as said in the description. trust me you don't want to end up with just a game disc you can't even play."
5,PS2 Eyetoy,"Finally! I video game that mom can feel good about letting the kids spend hours playing! For the first time, the kids are getting EXERCISE while playing a video game. You're really in the game while you box, kick and jump your way through all the exciting games. I joined in with the kids and was actually breathing hard after a couple of games. This game is fun for the whole family. We give it a ""two thumbs up"". We paid full price and would do it again! Buy it and start the fun! It really is incredible."
5,WOW!,"I-Toy is so much fun. It is the best game you'll ever play. You are litterally in the game wether it's the Mirror Game or the Kung Foo Game it is the best. To bad it's only for PS2. I mean they should make it for Gamecube, X-Box, or even PS1. There are so many good games on PS2 and PS1 that are only for PS2 or PS1. Like Kingdom Hearts."
4,Good family game for all ages,"My wife & I purchased this PS2 game for our 12 yr old daughter for Christmas. She's not much of a PS2 game fan, however, she loves this game. All our children (and mom) down to the 5 yr old have played and enjoy this game. They all have their favorite ""category"". Highly recommended for the interactive gamer."
5,This is fun for the entire family!,"What a cool toy! We bought this for Christmas 2003 and we are so glad we did! My husband and I (ages 34 & 35) couldn't stop playing it! But our 2 1/2 and 3 1/2 year old sons wanted to play it also! My Mother in Law came over and played it also! What a blast! The boxing is great, and what a workout! This is aerobics that you don't know you're doing!I am so glad I purchased this toy! Maybe now I can get my exercise in! :-)"
5,The most original video game in a long time,"Our family had a blast with Eye Toy. It's very original, has lasting appeal and is going to be the best party game when having guests (young or adult) over for the holidays. This one is a clear winner, at a fantastic price. You get the camera and 12 games (on one disc) in the package."
3,It's pretty good,Its pretty cool technology. My only complaint is that it only plays special games which don't seem like more than demos. You can play GTA Vice City with Physicam but not with Sony's product? They should make it like Physicam so that it plays all games.
4,GREAT EXERCISE!!,I've seen the Eye Toy testet on RTL (german tv station) and did take my children to the german Toy Store to try it out. The games are FUN and you should've seen all the kids in the store waiting for their turn! The whole PURPOSE of this gadet is for the children (and older couch potatos) to get some exercise in this Video Game obsessed aera. The test results (performed by doctors) show that a child playing the Karate game on Eye Toy for 20 minutes is loosing just as many calories as playing soccer for 15 minutes!! I think it is a great way of tricking our little video junkies into exercise and them thinking that they are just playing a video game! Since I don't have a PAL system PS2 I had to wait for the american version to come out and I can't wait to give it to my son! :)
3,good yes but ....,have been listening to the blues for 30+yrs. Robillard's a fine player but it all sounds too artificial to me.The samples I listened to lack spontaneity and feeling.
1,Reiman's book is just terrible.,"This book, which pretends to have a liberal answer to the abortion debate, is just awful. His arguement is basicly this; we value humans in different ways at different points of their lives, these seems to roughly correspond to how rational to human is. Since the fetus lacks rationality, it isn't an entity which has a right to life. While supporters of this arguement may claim this is a misrepresenting it, it really isn't. If Reiman has taken his head out of the philosophical stratosphere and examined the problem, he may have come up with a better arguement. As it is now, it simply represents the way some moral philosophy no longer talks about the real world. Pass this one up. Besides, at this price for the skimpy book (less than 100p), you'd do better using it for nearly anything else."
3,A good sampler,"I love Keith Green's passionate music for Christ. It's the most Spirit filled music I've ever heard. But let's face it. This sampler barely scratches the surface of Keith's heart. One of the biggest tragedies of the last 7 years is to see Keith Green's albums fall out of print. Sure, you can still get all the songs when you buy the magisterial Ministry Years 1977-1979 and Ministry Years 1980-1982 (except the totally awesome live version of ""If You Love the Lord,"" or the prayerful worship at the end of the remixed ""O Lord You're Beautiful""), but there's nothing quite like the original releases. Hearing the songs in the order and way in which Keith wanted them heard. Skip this and get Ministry Years or the originals (if you can find them)"
3,So You Wanna Go Back to Egypt?????,"Okay, there are some great songs on this cd, but where is the title track to what many consider Keith's best album. To produce a record /cd and leave this one song off is a shame. Keith deemed ""So You Wanna Go Back To Egypt"" as being a worthy title track, it's too bad those who compiled this collection did not follow his lead."
2,Not a Substitute for Bathing,"This ""dry"" shampoo is a dusty powder that claims to remove oils, dirt, and product build-up from your horse's coat. It really does nothing more than leave your horse with a citrus fragrance. I saw no better results than if I had just given my horse a good rub-down with a curry and stiff brush. Definitely not a substitute for a good old shampoo and water bath."
1,Not neccesary,"Its ok, not really neccessary, it just covers parts of the PSPmy son removed it he didn't like how sticky it was."
5,"KEEP ""VISITATIONS"" CLOSE BY FOR DAILY INSPIRATION","This lovely and inspirational collection of heartwarming stories takes all the sting out of ""death"". There is so much love and peace and joy in this book. Everyone on this earth has experienced the pain of ""losing"" a loved one. This book proves, over and over, again, that love is never lost, and that death is only a graduation. It is a study in communication."
3,Visitations,She put together many stories from her personal experience and experiences from many other people as well. I get distracted from this style and have found I put it down often and not read it for awhile. I does give us hope and knowledge we are not alone.
1,Magnetix Flying Saucer,Very Frustrating...Instructions were absolutely terrible & incomplete.Set did not even come with the pieces required to build the saucer.Save yourself some grief and look for something else!
4,Hi-Res Muppets...is there anything better in the world?,This game is very fun. Not quite what I expected and not a great one player game. If you have kids or are a kid or simply love muppets like I do then you will have a blast playing multi-player. I play with my niece and we just laugh at the wacky little games. Enjoy!
1,Need more info,"I might buy this if I could see it better. Need to know the pockets, what it can hold. More info and bigger pics please."
4,The Injustice of Justice,The stark reality of our court system and its tragic flaws is brought home with little relief in this gripping tale of the murder of a father and son and the slow death of another son and his family.
1,Lived it!,"I was 11 years old when this happened and I lived 4 houses away. Robbie was a good friend of mine and I was forever changed by this event. I hope you all can understand that this book is very one sided. As someone who was close to the real victims in this case, we feel that justice was done. This man not only took the life of an innocent man, but an innocent boy. Robbie was a sweet, caring and funny boy and he never had a chance. Scott was a troubled kid who made the chose to murder 2 people and now we all have to live with it. It's been 19 years and I still walk around my house every night make sure all the doors and windows are locked. Where's the book for us"
5,Some Great Southern Rock n Roll,Surprising just how many hits .38 Special had. Great compilation of their best work. Not many tracks I skip. Great driving rock.
3,Good Compilation,"Always liked several .38 special songs, but never bought any albums until this one. It contains just about every song I liked and the quality is good as well. Worth the money."
4,High Five for Mary Mac'K,I am an elementary physical education teacher and I have thoroughly enjoyed using many of the hand clapping games in my classes. The students love the hand motions along with reciting the rhymes. This is great practice for coordination and rhythm. I would recommend this book for any educator looking for fun and exciting ways to engage students in hands on learnning.
4,Great to Share with your Kid and Her Friends,"Written by twelve year old Sarah Bernstein, this fun book has all your favorite childhood ""Hand Clap"" games in it, from ""Miss Mary Mack"" to ""Say, Say Oh Playmate"". Bernstein researched and collected Hand Clap games from all over the country to gather over 40 ""Hand Clap"" games, including many I've never heard of, but all that I remember. Interestingly, the ""Miss Lucy had a Steamboat"" Hand Clap listed in the book, is not the scatological version I'd learned as a child, but rather a ""clean"" version you'd be happier to share with your children.The book is laid out in a clever manner with the lyrics, the musical notes, as well as visual cues as to the hand movements. The last part of the book has a section for writing your own ""Hand Clap"" games with your children or friends. This book is sure to be a hit for your kids and their friends!"
2,Hard To Follow,"I found this book hard to follow. The author put a lot of effort into trying to make this an easy book. There are 79 hand pictures of the basic hand claps with the movements described in words, but I just can't get it. Music notes are included for each rhyme. I wish the author would have included rhythym as well. I have yet to use it with my students."
1,Disappointing,The drawings are too small to see what you need to do. I know these hand claps and the songs and I don't think a school-age child could figure this out very easily.
1,Doesn't work in USA.,"I'm just confirming what was written in another review that this DVD will not work in the USA. (I wish I had read his review before purchasing but I didn't.) There's no indication of this in the Amazon description or on the packaging -- in fact, the description and packaging seem to indicate it will work fine in the USA, but it doesn't. I'm not sure if the manufacturer simply inserted the wrong type of disc in the boxes for one batch of these DVD's or if there's some different issue but I would suggest you hold off buying this until you see something on the Amazon page confirming that the problem has been corrected. The good news is that Amazon is always super easy to deal with on returns, so assuming they do indeed credit me for my return, this negative experience only reinforces the fact that Amazon is a great place to do business."
5,Fits perfectly,I was please to know that this replacement foot fit perfectly and I have not had any problems with it.
1,Agressively Awful,"There are a ton of bad gay movies out there, but few are this awful. Awkward and bad acting. Pointless story. At times creepy. Nothing about this work. Also terribly boring. Avoid at all costs. And gay moviemakers, just give up if this is the best you can do."
4,excellent!,"I bought this camera to replace an older Kodak digital I got around 2000 and was very comfortable with. I was very pleased with the features for the price of this model, as well as the other reviews I read. I haven't had an opportunity to use it much yet other than a some quick pictures around the house, but so far I love it. It's very simple to figure out and gives excellent results. It does burn up batteries pretty fast, but only two at a time, so rechargeables are definitely the way to go. The drawback for me has been the EasyShare software, which I ended up uninstalling. It was too intrusive and slowed my computer down (probably my computer's fault more than the software). I prefer to just directly load the photos to my computer by putting the memory card into the slot on my computer and using other software to edit if needed. Overall, I think the camera is great and would definitely recommend it!"
4,Purchased for my five year old,This camera is simple and easy to use. I purchased it for my five year old and she loves it! The pictures that are taken appear on the screen until a new shot is taken. She loves that she is able to see her latest picture. I have taken video with it twice and when we try to see it through the camera the appears to be no sound. I have not connected it to my computer yet. I do recommend purchasing a sd card so more pictures can be stored. When comparing the new Fisher Price digital camera made for children I opted to get this camera instead. It has more features and for a few dollars more was well worth the investment.
4,Extremely pleased!!!,"Camera arrived in excellent condition approximately 36 hours after I placed the order!!! Granted, I live slightly close to the seller, I thought it would be at least 3 or 4 days before delivery. This is the perfect Christmas gift!"
1,flaw in the screen,"my problem is that camaras buys 3 easyshare c-433 kodak, one of which me salio with flaw in the screen, reenvio to be solved the problem and to date presents/displays I have not had answer if they are going to me to send another one or they are going to me to reimburse the money"
1,Kodak Repir Problem,"It a wonderful product, takes amazing pictures and easy to use. The only problem I had was with the company they contract out to for repair work. The camera worked great for almost a year but then, without warning, the screen suddenly filled with horizontal white lines during all modes. I obtained a return authorization from Kodak and shipped it their repair center. After three months of unanswered phone calls and e-mails, I called an 800 number asked them why it's taking so long for my camera to get repaired. They told me the camera's on hold for unspecified customer damage. That's nuts! The camera was well taken care, never dropped or exposed to liquids. After contacting Kodak to look into this they came through and I got my camera back the next week. They did an excellent job repairing it but negelected to return my 1gb SD card. Oh well, at least I got the camera back. If I hadn't pressed it with Kodak, I don't know if I would have seen it ever again."
4,Yes!,"I bought this camera in july for $69 on Amazon and I have had no problems whatsoever. It is quite possibly the easiest piece of technology to use. It has a fast shutter speed, great pictures, a good zoom, incredibly good video and a large enough screen. It uses batteries pretty quickly, but buy some rechargeable AAs and you'll be fine. Also, you can't zoom during video and the flash is sometimes WAAAY to powerful. Once I took a picture in pitch black and it came out. This was not my first camera, but I get the feeling i won't be needing another for a long time."
4,Nice,I'm a first time digital camera purchaser so I know little about these cameras. I like it and could use it with little expertise.
3,Good for a typical Camera User,"This camera is for the typical average user. Not a user who wants to take pictures of the outdoors, or at a zoo. Around the house photos, facebook, and myspace picture are good for this camera. Zoom sucks, so does dark places. So if this is your kids first camera, go right ahead! i give it a 3, the zoom is horrible( *note: im not a typical user)"
1,Not worth it at any price,"My daughter received this camera as a gift. Koday Easyshare was supposed to be so great, but I don't agree. I am not a novice at taking pictures and have taken many great pictures with my Canon Powershot. The Kodak camera eats up batteries like mad. There is a delay between pressing the button and when the camera actually snaps the picture, which has resulted in many missed shots. It is very sensitive to motion and pictures come out blurry. On top of that the software that you use to download pictures (and you need the software to download, unlike the Canon) is a memory hog and bogs down my computer (2 different versions installed on two computers). Other than the camera being lightweight, I don't have anything good to say about it. I realize this is an older model now (not when we received it), but it's only two years old and I'm ready to pitch it because it is so frustrating to use."
4,"Takes good pictures, but eats AA batteries!","I bought this camera, as a Christmas gift for my daughter. The camera takes very good pictures, however it goes through AA batteries like crazy. Make sure you stock up on quality AA batteries, or get yourself rechargeable AA batteries. It is an economical choice for someone just starting out with a digital camera, or if you just need a descent quality low cost camera."
2,Good for Beginners,"It's more of a choreography dvd than a workout one. I would more recomend it for 'advanced beginners', those who have a basic knowledge of the sport, but still need to learn at a slower pace.As a former cheerleader, i disliked how some of the dance moves were 'flow-y', more like traditional dance. Cheer-dancing and Dancing are two very different genres, and this Dvd tried to attempt to combine them."
5,This book rocks!,"This is quite honestly one of the funniest books I've ever read. Some of it's base, some of it's tasteless, but it's all shameless and all funny. The wry interactive (sorta) style in which the book is written really makes the reader feel like a part of the ""how to"" experience used as the platform for the jokes. It's fast, witty, and insightful; a smartly written book that truly is ""laugh-out-loud funny (Stan Lee).&quot"
5,The Funniest Book I have ever read.,"I found this book to be absolutely hillarious, but Isuppose the kind of humour is not everyone's cup of tea.If you enjoy obscene, black humour, much like one canfind on alt.tasteless.jokes on good day, this book is adefinite must.Sure, it's juvenile, but it is fun."
2,ROTFLMAO Funny,"The book is funny in and of itself but if you are a GAMER then the jokes get magnified by a factor of a thousand! This book is the one book everyone I game with has read and quotes like its a segment from ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail""! The British version IS better than the US release but BOTH are laugh out loud hilarious! I bought mine new when it first came out and its rather sad condition is from the fact it has been read and enjoyed by MANY of my friends! If you can lay your hand son a copy - DO SO! You will laugh until you fall down!"
1,The worst book that I've ever read.,"This is the absolute worst book that I've ever read (and finished). It was intended to be funny, but it's just pitiful. I'm shocked that other people enjoyed it."
1,"Awful Recording, Not Entertaining","Long, rather boring stage performance. 2 hours of poorly recorded video footage without any type of editing -- their assistant has to get after the camera guy because the camera is left pointed at her during the opening part of the show -- and rather lacking in guest animation. Rarely did anything actually occur from the participants. Not worth a penny. I'm requesting a refund through Amazon on this purchase."
1,Stage Hypnosis is entertainment,"This video (which I've seen and not purchased) is a prime example of why I have to spend at least 20 minutes of my valuable time asking clients what their experience of hypnosis is.But hey, I'm all for a good time. However potential purchasers should note that this is a STAGE SHOW. The participants were chosen for their ability to please the hypnotist(s). That said, if anyone is gullible enough to spend hard earned money for this, bear in mind that, even as a STAGE SHOW it is poorly produced and, I have to say, boring. Perhaps the people attending the show were having a great time, but you at home won't. Stage hypnosis is entertainment. This video was not.Lawrence BullockCHt"
1,Another hunk 'O' Junk,"We bought this firewall four months ago, replacing their old SOHO and their newer piece of junk edge firewall. This new one has crashed four timen, one less than their other edge firewall, with same results...losing it's firmware for no reason. I give up with Watchguard. Never ever ever ever buy this product we are back on our old firewall and would like to return this one if we could get a hold of anyone"
1,Piece of Junk - My worst tech purchase ever!,"Bought this for $860 on 17 July 2007. It is May 6th today. The product worked once for 5 minutes. It is complicated and the issues keep changing everytime. I wanted something easy to use for a small office. I am very tech savvy but I just cannot configure this one. Reaching out to their tech support is no use.They outsourced it to a India based company called R Systems whose support is even worse than this product. When you call them, they never have a tech support handy. I have even tried setting aside an entire afternoon and told them to reach me but no use. Right now, it is 30 minutes after asking for an escalation and it neither agent nor supervisor is available. They will call at their leisure and if you are around may be there is luck. I have tried reaching out to tech support 6-8 times over six months.Save yourself this agony. My reviews are mostly well balanced. But this product and the tech support company both fully deserve this review."
2,I was mistaken!,"I have to say I was disappointed with this book in general, I found the tittle to be misleading in that I felt it implied there might actually be some patient care modalities described as indicated from the description paragraph ""Although other books cover clinical aspects of transport medicine...none have the scope, depth, and authority of this one."" This book is definitely geared toward the Transport Coordinater and NOT the medic or RN treating the Pt. I'm not saying the information given is erroneous and in fact it is required, however if you are not charged with the logistics of a transport...do not purchase this book."
5,The perfect size!,"At first I thought it was too small - but I was wrong. It is perfect for bringing my lunch to work (microwave use). With the need to get rid of all the plastic in our lives, this is the perfect addition to my lunch bag!"
4,Good product!!,A great product!! Reheats food pretty good in the microwave and the lid it brings with the pop ins is a good ideal and it helps the lid to stay on but still heats the center of the food!! The dish since it's stoneware it heats faster and cleaning is a breeze..It doesn't stain the dish even though it stains the lid but hopefully corningware will make stain free lids someday too!! Other then that I love corningware & corelle products!!
1,beware,"My experience with other Jwin products would prevent me from buying this; for example, the JX-P3228 (radio and cassette) boombox. The FM antenna broke off the second time I used it. The volume control was erratic and difficult to control -- sometimes from barely audible to blasting after barely moving the control. The tape speeds of the two decks were inconstant, and the motor died completely far too soon."
1,Not sturdy enough for a stool,"We've had this ""stool"" only 3 days and we've had to re-tighten the screws every single day. This is not sturdy enough for a stool - it should be marketed as a side table. My son is so upset because the table that matches, and the stool, were a birthday gift. We all know when something feels like it is falling apart day after day, it is extremely frustrating.I took packaging to the dumpster the evening we put it together because everything seemed fine. The next morning...in he comes carrying the stool with 2 wiggly legs. We re-tightened...very tight. The next day, same thing.Also, no instructions at all included. If we hadn't put together the matching table first, we would have been hard-pressed to figure this out.Two thumbs down :-("
2,"Virology, virology, virology","This author loves the word virology. It doesn't matter if everyone in the room with the main characters is a virologist, Jane will continue saying it over and over. Virology.The descriptions in this book were wonderful. The suspense was good. It just didn't feel like the main characters would have gotten together in a normal setting, making their relationship a ""smoke 'em if you got 'em"" sort of thing."
1,NOT VOL. 2,"The music on this disc is great, but it is not really a volume 2. If you have the 2 Disc version of Live with a Little Help, this stuff will be new to you, but the stuff on this disc is included on the four disc version of L.W.A.L.H. along with lots of other good stuff like Gamblers Roll, 32-20 Blues, I Shall Return and more.....the 4 disc was real hard to get for a while, but now it seems to be readily available. Pick that one up if you can, skip this one."
1,Buy The Collectors Edition Instead...,"I own LWALHFOF, The Collectors Edition as well as the two CD version. For my money this product is a waste. Gov't Mule with the late great Allen Woody(bass) was a spectacular band. Mixing equal parts blues, funk, jazz, country, and space jamming this band in some ways even surpassed its parent band, the 1990's ABB.Warren Haynes felt that he had to release the four CD set because the concert was great. I concur with that assessment.Do yourself a favor, lay down the extra $$ for the expanded edition I promise you won't be disappointed!"
4,polisher pad,Purchased to work with a Porter Cable polisher and backing plate. It does indeed work well.
3,Not an Interracial novel,"If this is considered a interracial novel, then I need someone to explain it to me. The book was ok but it was misleading. In the last 60 days I have read over 40 interracial novels, so I think I know how to pick them."
4,The Most Wonderful Book Ever,"This book is a heart-warming story about a young girl at the ageof 16, who has had cancer recently and has lost two friends to cancer.But, when she runs into an old friend does she feel more than just a friendship around him?"
4,works great,This hitch works great and was easy to install. The only problem was is the mounting area should be longer and go further along the chassis to have better support.
3,Did Not Fit - Curt Was No Help,"The hitch seems to be very well constructed. This doesn't matter since the hitch doesn't fit a 1500 Dodge Ram - even though Curt Manufacturing claims it does.To be more specific, it doesn't fit *my* Dodge Ram. After sending several photos of the issue, many emails, and a long phone call with customer service, Curt Manufacturing said ""Sorry, it doesn't fit and we aren't sure why. Maybe you can fabricate a bracket to make it fit, good luck and good bye.""Completely unacceptable.Update: I changed the rating from 1 star to 3. I was able to get it to fit - no thanks to customer service. If it is going to be a tricky fitting, assume that you will be on your own."
1,Piece of crap,"I actually have the 2 GB model but that doesn't change any of my comments.The primary problem I have with this is that the earbuds don't fit in my ears. They are way too big. And they fall out. This means I can't wear it when I run. Even when I'm fairly stationary while using it, it's really uncomfortable. Why don't they fit? I'm a 5'2"" woman. My ears are not as big as those of the 5'8"" man they probably made this for. This essentially makes it unusable for me.Also, the chord for the earbuds is too small and I can't put the mp3 player in my pocket. The mp3 player hangs half way down my chest. Again, I'm a 5'2"" woman - it would be worse for someone taller.The radio reception stinks.The buttons are poorly labeled and it's hard to figure out how to work it - including how to turn it on and off.It eats batteries, even when it's off. After about 3 weeks of not using it the battery is dead. They might die sooner - I don't know.Don't get this thing."
5,Good for the refills,I always hoped that some day someone would invent a refillable filter for the HVAC. I can't complain. Filters out a lot of dust that would end up on the furniture otherwise.
1,No Guarantee,"The seller guaranteed that this product would yield mushrooms. I did get 5 mushrooms, but then it would not fruit again regardless of the fact that I contacted the seller and followed directions to the ""T"". Seller refused to replace the log since I did get 5 mushrooms at the very beginning. At that price I decided to throw away the log and buy mushrooms from a local organic supplier."
1,Propostion 65 Warning?,Why in hell does this product have a Prop.65 warning on it? I've checked a few other brands of Horny Goat Weed sold on Amazon and see no such warning on them. Whats up?
4,From One Brat to Another,"Marilyn's brat book should find its own nitche in the small world of brat related literature. It is non-fiction, but it deals only with Marilyn and her family. Ms. Morris takes us back to the early days of post-World War II and to places were we and Communisim faced each other - Korea and Austria. Her book is well written and well remembered. My only fault is that she appears to repeat herself a couple of times. i still found it a pleasant and informative read and I was happy to compare my experiences with hers."
2,Doesn't really fit,My Mother's walker is a standard walker with front wheels and the ability to be folded. The tray sits over the top but doesn't really fit well enough and it would be too costly for me to return it - I should have got it from the same company the walker was ordered from.
3,Not so universal,"If the slots that fit over the walker handles were 1/4 - 1/2 inch longer, it would fit my Mada Medical walker."
1,Not a universal tray!,"On the walker, the tray is unstable and ideal for mess as if you let go of oneside, the contents will obey the laws of gravity and fall down. It did not work for my mother and I would not recommend this product."
2,Tray will tip,"We have a standard size walker. The opening on the tray needs to be 12"" but it is only 11 1/2"". If the person puts items on the tray it will tip over unless the items are put in the center and lifted off. We added some foam and duct tape about 1"" above the walker crossbar on all 4 corners... so far this seems to work. We did not wand to keep hunting around and the tray is very sturdy."
5,Repurpose Tray for Surprising Use,"I ordered two of these trays for my walkers during post-surgery rehabilitation. They are great for ""carrying"" items to and from kitchen and for keeping books and water bottle, etc. at hand at a time when my hands were otherwise occupied! After I no longer needed the walker, the tray became a handy laptop table, lowered to the appropriate height. Now I have my laptop on a table on wheels! My only suggestion to the manufacturer is to make the openings for cups (there are two holes in the tray) larger to fit cups, mugs, and glasses in use today. The holes are too small to be used for anything."
3,GREAT - IF they fit,The trays are great - only IF they fit. Ad says fits MOST standard walkers. Didn't fit my standard walker.
4,"Nice item, but not for all walkers","This tray is very handy, and fits my mom's walker pretty well. However, the cup holders are right over the collapsing hinges, so they are basically not usable. The tray can be turned around so that the cup holders are at the bottom of the tray instead of the top (closer to the person) but then the ""V"" of the tray is pointing to the person walking instead of away from them. It works, but it's not as nice as if the tray were put on correctly. It really helps the person using it to carry plates, cup of coffee, etc., that they couldn't do before. Just be sure it's on level & don't walk too fast!"
3,Not the wisest choice,With a broken femur the walker is needed for support. The tray gets in the way and therefore has little value for carrying items. Although it is being used as a laptop table when seated!
1,Shipping Problems-defects,"I will not buy anything from ""As Seen on TV"" again. I sent this as a gift. It arrived in makeshift box, with gaping holes and no packing slip. The tray was cracked/damaged. When I contacted customer service about returning it, I will have to pay for the shipping to send it back. I do not really see that with this level of carelessness that I would like a replacement - that was the only option. When I told the customer service representative there was no packing slip, I was told ""I find that hard to believe"". They have definitely lost a customer and I would warn others about ordering from them."
2,tipsy,"We have two walkers. This tray did not fit properly on either one. It does not go down far enough over the hand rails to fit snuggly, so it tips at an angle when you put anything on it. Bad investment."
1,Not a Univerdal Walker Tray,"We bought this tray hopng to solve the ""tipping"" problem my mother-in-law has with the basket on her walker. However, since she has a walker that folds, the tray does not sit evenly and is unusable. When I attempted to return it, the postage with tracking and delivery confirmation, which the company asked for, was more than we had paid for the tray! The tray itself seems fine and the idea is a good one, but it would be helpful if we had known that it fits only non-folding walkers, since it is advertised as a ""universal"" tray."
2,Universal Walker Tray Review,This tray does not stay secure on the walker. It teeter totters back and forth which spills the food.
1,watch for size,"Got this for my 88 yr old father because he really needed somthing like this. Unfortunately, although I thought his folding walker was a standard size, the tray does not fit. It simply will not fit over the handle bars by about 1/2 inch and there is no way to make it work."
5,"Great for teachers, therapists, & parents","This is a great tool for teachers, therapists, and parents. I first learned about this when I attended a mini-conference for Early Intervention therapists. I decided to buy this for my son, who has been receiving therapy for gross motor, fine motor, and speech for 3 years. This tape incorporated both the gross motor & speech therapy ideas nicely. I plan to show it to his preschool teacher to see if they would like to borrow it for the classroom. This is also fun for children who do not have any special needs, as it provides a way to get up & play song & movement games. Probably a great gift for a stay-at-home mom!"
3,"good, but NOT great","music is like built to spill, without any guitar explorations. its a straight ""by the book"" rock album, which is good but not great. vocals are heavy on the reverb. a mix between perry farrell and jim james , which is good but not great. i like the disc, and i play it often. its a great disc for a debut album though, and a good buy!! i have a feeling their next album will be great, BUT its on themselves to do something original and stop being someone else."
4,Band of Horses...,"Band of Horses have a sound that puts them in good company (see any of the reviews below for a good list of contemporaries) but, somehow this album rises above most of them for me. BOH exhibit a sense of balance that is unusual for the genre. The intelligence alone doesn't distinguish them, nor does the wonderful pop sensibility, or their simple charm, but they somehow keep all of these balls in the air without leaning too heavily on any single strength.Buy the album, it's beautiful and good for what ails us all.http://battlesphincter.blogspot.com/"
3,Oh,"Decent music, good laid back indie-pop, though the vocalist has some kind of unnatural obsession with the vowel ""O"", or, the exclamation, ""Oh!""Seriously. Use other vowels. They're all free."
2,Too many average songs,"The funeral is a great song. But, unfortunately, the rest of the songs are average compositions far from the quality of the biggest hit.Everything All the Time"
2,meh...,"i really liked the first song ('the first song') and was excited about hearing these guys and what else they did, then i got the record and then i got very bored. they're not bad but they're like a less complicated version of elliot or a less dramatic coedine...you knew where coedine was going with everything but they made you wait for it and it was still satisfying, i can't say that for these fellows. maybe on 'the first song'. when i started thinking 'do something else' they did; it wasn't a surprise, but it was something else.maybe i don't like they're style either. i liked elliot's records when i heard them, but i don't feel any need to listen to them now.man, coedine, they sounded like they were going to fall on their faces while they were recording."
2,My Morning Jacket the Second???,Short and sweet...I think my title says it all...Do yourselves a favor and stick with the original MMJ...
2,No more Neil Young clones please,"J Mascis, Wayne Coyne and Doug Martsch have already done enough Neil Youg type vocals and now we've got these guys and a bunch of other clones like Grandaddy blah blah blah. Buy On The Beach and be done with it. This stuff reeks."
2,**1/2,"Despite all the other opinions, I find that they sound much more like Porno for Pyros (Perry Farrell's post-Jane's Addiction band) than My Morning Jacket. They are much poppier and, IMHO, more boring than MMJ. This is very run-of-the-mill stuff that doesn't stand up to repeated listenings. I liked it most after a single spin, and my enthusiasm has shrank with each repeat to the point that I can't imagine a mood that would warrant another listen."
5,Pass It Along,"The importance of having friends with good taste comes home to roost. How long would have it taken me otherwise to find out about such a great album? Band of Horses takes 36 minutes to create a perfect album with no song too short and no song too long. It's almost like they heard ""It Still Moves"" by My Morning Jacket and said ""Not bad, but we could do it much better and quicker"" and they wouldn't be lying.Taking nothing away from MMJ and It Still Moves which was a fantastic album, but It Still Moves wasn't exactly a lesson in brevity. Band of Horses borrows a small page from MMJ's overall sound but makes an entirely new and fantastic package. This is one album that requires no second guessing of track selection, location, etc. You just put it on and let it go. The cd player will do the rest.A great album through and through. It's certainly a sound for sore ears as I eagerly awaited my favorite new spring time CD. This is it, enjoy!"
4,Down To Earth Album,"I bought this album for one song, ""The Funeral"", which can be heard on the popular video game ""Skate"". I was worried that making the purchace based on that influence alone would be a mistake but was relieved to hear the rest of the album to be just as satisfying. The South Carolina band produced some very Earthy tones on each track and it is a nice cd to enjoy while stretching out on the couch to relax. The only negative comment that I could make would be that a couple songs sound too much alike.Something like that can be overlooked."
1,"whoa, pony","banal, derivative, overproduced tripe. whiney, lame, stupid vox/lyrics.a country-inflected KILLERS--i.e. soul-less corporate rock gone trendy (read""alt-country"" wannabes with My Bloody Valentine fantasies).Sub Pop, whence the spate of horribly BORING records. i've not bothered to listsong tracks cause they're really undeniably samey, these songs--one after anirksome other.don't waste money--buy GOOD RECORDS: yo la tengo, sparklehorse, the black watch,the radio dept. all put out excellent albums this year. investigate!"
5,Good brain teasers,This has some good brain teasers and is fun. It is not for little kids but junior high school kids should be able to do some of these.Peter Schrag
1,selling fragrance testers?,"I came to Amazon to purchase my fragrance Dior Addict.3.4 oz 90.00. What I received was a tester full size but a tester that would be used in store for customers to try.I paid 90.00 for collateral product. I am very upset with this.My career of 30 yrs was spent in the cosmetics industry. I am sure that Dior will be very unhappy when I tell them about this. Who has authorized you to sell their fragrance testers? And for full retail price. Their are so many financial ramifications of where and how testers ate paid for,used as deductiions as cost of goods, ect ect ectAmazon should be aware of this as will Dior by end of day"
2,False product,The perfume I got smells really similar to the real Dior addict but I think it is imitation perfume. It's a different color and smells slightly different. If I wouldve known I would get this I would've just gone to the mall and got the REAL stuff.
2,Broken cap!!,"This product came with the cap broken, and spilled into the box.The package seemed to be ok, and nothing looked bad outside.I can't explain how the cap broke.The only explanation is that it came broken since dealer."
5,Best kept secret,"Your phermones dictate how colognes are affected, (if you can't smell it on you, it's right for you!); I found my gem. Not a moment, day, encounter goes by that a woman or man does not say to me ""gosh, you smell great!"" or ""I could just stand by you all day"". I prefer NOT to tell them what I'm wearing for I do not want a lot of women in my area smelling this good. LOL! But, for any women out there that wants to be set apart from the crowd of others, try this cologne. Seriously, what have you got to lose?Merry, Monterey, CA."
4,Great Music,Mr. Jose Mario Branco is a famous traditional musician in Portugal. This music is soft and appealing even to non-Portuguese speakers. I highly recommend this album to fans of world and traditional music.
4,Surprising good story and excellently acted!!!,"Even thought I have never heard of this movie,I just happened to find it when I was in the video Store and then I bought it. This movie a dark movie, fascinating, well acted, and well scripted. Mos Def's character is excellently performed, and Brendan Fraser played a character which is very uncharteristic of his other roles. You will be surprised!"
4,Another good small budget film,"Journey to the End of the Night was pretty good for a smaller budget type film. I would not necessarily call it a low budget film, but not a large budget one either and it's really hard to tell by viewing it since it really does not appear to have a low price tag. The story was interesting and never got board watching it. Many of the smaller titled movies like this one that I have seen on Universal HD channel have been really good and better than more expense, popular ones you see in retail/rental stores. Think in my opinion it says that a large dollar amount does not guarantee a better movie.Peter J. Miller"
5,He was amazing...,"I love every song on this CD.I had the opportunity to see him perform about 6 mos. before he died. In the audience, directly behind us, sat a group of little old ladies who started singing and dancing as soon as he began to play. It was truly magical and I am so thankful I was there. Since that time I have searched for anything and everything I could lay my hands on.It also amazes me that he is not better known outside of Cuba."
2,MoonDog,"Quirky characters that are not really likeable and a timeline that isn't consistent make MoonDog a challenging read, even for mystery lovers. Certain plot twists do capture one's imagination sparking lots of discussion and debate within our book group."
4,Seifer Almasy's Hyperion Gunblade! XD,I ordered the last Fri of Oct & i received my order that following Mon! It came so fast! I'm really excited. I've wanted this since i had 1st laid my yes on it. It so cool to see it up close while holding it in my hands. It's even bigger than i thought. I plan to use my new item as an art reference for drawing. It has such detail & looks just as i imagined the Hyperion Gunblade would look like on closer observation! I'd say perfecto for a collector!
3,Cool,"This ""toy"" is more for decoration than for fun and it is a bit smaller than I imagined but if you are a Final Fantasy fan or know someone who is, it is really cool and the detail is great."
3,"A Reference Book, Not Tool Kit","This is a reference book based on PMBOK, with very concise summaries of project management processes. For example, the Project Charter is covered in two pages. It is not for novice project leaders as the book states. There are no examples or templates to show you how you can prepare your documents."
4,Good read,"I thought that this was a good read...and maybe not the deepest, most meaningful book on project management - but for the price a worthy addition to a PM's bookshelf.I do recommend this book."
3,"As the title suggests, this is the ""leftovers""...","Jack Handey got a lot of mileage out of his ""Deep Thoughts"" series, but I think the word ""rejected"" would be more fitting than ""lost"" for this fourth volume. I don't want to suggest that it's bad by any means, but it's definitely the most hit-and-miss of the series. Some of the passages are classic Jack Handey (""Toward the end of the Stone Age, I bet there was already a feeling that metal was just around the corner.""), but many of them are downright lame (""Life is a constant battle between the heart and the brain. But guess who wins. The skeleton.""). If you've got the other three volumes, this one is absolutely essential, but if you're a newbie, don't start here. Pick up ""Deep Thoughts"", ""Deeper Thoughts"", and ""Deepest Thoughts""."
4,"Get lost in ""The Lost Deep Thoughts""","I happen to like the ""Deep Thoughts"" seiries, so of course I like this one. Jack's way of turning a situation into a psychobabble feel good statement is hilarious and the pairing of the nature photographs reminds me of those dumb motivational posters at work - you know, the one where it's a photograph of an eagle flying over a canyon and it says something such as ""Strive with all your being to fly as the eagle does fly and makes more widgets for our company to make huge profits from"" or some nonsense like that. (Okay, the signs _don't_ say the widget thing.)It's vaguely comforting to read this book, to know that Jack's still out there (in more ways than one!) pondering his ""deep thoughts"" and sharing them with us. If you enjoyed the other books, you'll want this book."
5,1970 El Camino,My friend at work restored a 1970 El Camino that he left in California. The car would not run so I ordered the pump and gasket for him and had it sent to California as he does not have an amazon account. Amazon thoughtfully allows this. His son installed the pump and it works very well. We were both amazed at the low price and high quality of the Airtex pump.
4,Learning Material for PMPs,I use Tom's book as supplemental reading to the basic PMBOK for students in my PM Risk classes. I love the fact that it is illustrutive of the concepts introduced and discussed in the PMBOK. His book enhances the learning experience. They gain knowledge from his own experience as well as the additional knowledge from the case study used throughout the book. It is helpful for all to put concepts together with real-life events in order to make it all come full circle.
2,Risk Management- Kendrick,"This book was very dry and did have sentence structure that was hard to follow at times. Kendrick gives some good examples and walks you through risk management well, but this book is for the more advanced project manager. This book is not ideal for a student learning risk management for the first time."
4,Very useful,Identifying and Managing Project RiskAs lecturer at the engineering faculty I have found this publication as a very helpful reading
2,Dry,"The book touches the topic of risk management on a high level. However, some examples are provides.It was a bit disappointing that the detail level is so limited. Moreover, I will be looking for other books on the subject."
1,Not worth the money look elsewhere,"I again make the mistake of taking the advice of some reviewers and bought this horrible movie. It consists of three loosely based stories none of which are very good or scary. The first 25 minutes of this thing consists of someone relaying the back story, very dull. There is one slight scar in the film otherwise not very good. In fact the guy who put this movie together must have been a dropout from film school, he goes out of his way to use every annoying cut, slice and angle you could think up. Oh and have I mentioned that the dubbing job is not very good. Keep your money for a good horror movie, pass on this inferior film."
5,best wow yet!,these are the best wow albums in order:1.wow 19982.wow 19973.wow 19994.wow 20005.wow 19966.wow 20017.wow 2002thank you and god loves you.
4,Terrific,"A great mix. The best is Clay Crosse ""Saving the World."" I'm burning up my CD on that song. Get it now."
5,Perfect for Virtual Piano Instrument,"I can't stress enough what everyone says: touch is a very personal thing. I didn't believe it until I tried the keyboard I was sure I was going to buy - and hated it. I personally like the 990xp as much as a Yamaha GHE keyboard, but that's my opinion.That said, this keyboard really made possible a Virtual Piano (East West Quantum Leap Pianos) for the price of a hardware solution.Keep in mind that you can only plug-in a footswitch type sustain pedal. If you want something fancier, you are going to have to go with something outboard to your computer like a CME GPP-3 (which I have not used and so am not endorsing)."
5,Great compilation of Lewis writings,"this is a compilation of portions of Lewis writings from many sources, arranged by topic, and mostly in short bits that are easy reading if you would like to use it for a daily devotional sort of reading."
5,Joyful Christian,"This is an excellent compilation of the best of C. S. Lewis taken from most of his greatest works. Lewis is a philosopher of great depth but expresses himself in flawless and simple terms...always getting to the heart of the matter in an understandable and inspirational way. If you can't read all of his works, this is a great book to see the highlights of them."
1,not the usual hue standard,i'm a big fan of hue tights. i own about 10 different kinds in fabric and colors and can truly say these were a big disappointment. they pilled up from my first wear at the calves when i had boots on and they snagged with every touch which is not usually the case with hue tights. i wouldn't recommend this item but i'm still a fan!
3,not as good as it use to be,I've used this stuff in the past many many times. Must be VOC regulations as this stufe does not work as well as it has in years past. Coverage is ok as long as you prime with a darker paint.
2,WRONG COLOR DISPLAY BUT WE MADE IT WORK,"Amazon, please fix this products color display. It is notthe color that arrived at my house. The cap color on the website is totally wrong. This color has no red like shown but a ivory tone. Very disappointing, but I made it work."
1,All of the texture washed off.,It was great befoe the rain came. All of the texture washed off my project. I was very dispointed. I wll not use this product again.
2,Inaccurate photo,"It's not all black, there are flecks of white in it as well. Not what I wanted, but not worth sending back. I'll probably spray it, then paint over it with solid black. Too bad."
1,This is Not Iran's National Country Flag,"How could this be Iran's ""National"" Flag, when the mullahs and ayatollah throw out the votes of the people to force our people to live under a tyrannical terrorist sponsoring regime that murders freedom lover in our universities and attacks the Persian foundations of our country. Islamic invaders have destroyed our country and need to have us return to the time when Persian Christians and Zoroastrians lived in Peace and Love."
4,1st Course in Abstract,"Fraleigh does a great job writing a book that is generally easy to follow.There is a big difference between the 6th and 7th edition, notably the change of sections and chapters. This has caused some issue for me considering my professor chose the 7th edition.One could comment that there are not enough examples for many of the theorems or corollaries but I believe a strong part of this book assumes that some of the conclusions YOU the reader need to come to on your own, i.e. by doing some of the problems."
5,Katrina Walker rocked this movie!,"This was an incredible movie. The kids in the movie, Katrina Melanie Walker and Scott Pyle, stole the show and were amazing in their roles. You could see the angst in these young people whose family is on the verge of break up. It was inspirational how Melissa (Katrina) plays match maker for the adults in the movie.Well done!"
1,DO NOT BUY!!!!!!,I just bought this for my psp recently. I was a piece of crap. I returned it and tried the new one. Still a piece of crap. I highly advise not to purchase this from ANYWHERE! I thought a cheap piece of plastic was going to protect my psp. Big mistake.P.S- CRAP
1,They Should Have Tested it BEFORE They Sold It,"Good idea, but when attached to my PSP the screws protrude too far inside the PSP and prevent the UMD door from opening/closing. So it's worthless."
1,Swing arm breaks,"While I like the slim profile provided by the face armor, this thing is poorly designed. It pivots on square plastic pegs and shatters after you flip it out a few times. Mine took less than a month to break."
2,Face Armor damaged my UMD drive,"In the process of attaching the Face Armor to my UMD drive I damaged the UMD drive. The drive didn't stop working right away, but did so a few days later."
5,Face armor/disk jackets,"Reviewing this item, it's the best that I've seen yet. The face armor is extremely easy to install. It screws in on the top. I screwed the armor on my PSP for the first time and no problem. If you read anything about the armor damaging the PSP, it may be because of the fact that the armor was defective in some way. An important note on the disk jackets. These are clear pieces of plasic, not glossy in any way. The inside of the armor has a piece of thin rubber on the inside. You really can't go wrong with this. Well worth the money."
3,"Good, but the hinges smash easily","i liked the size and form-factor of this cover. i travel a lot and being able to snap it open and closed on a plane was good. a couple of downsides: the lid does not open beyond 180 degrees so it can't be used as a stand while watching movies, and the hinges break easily - i went through two lids in three months. my advice: pay $20 and get the logitech hard case."
1,Psp Face Armor,"Garbage, garbage, garbage. The concept is great. It protects the screen and doesn't make the PSP too bulky to carry in your pocket. But it is made so shabby that after you open it up a few times, the plastic snaps and it's junk."
3,Tried it... didn't like it,"I bought this item since I couldn't find anything else at the time. I had trouble getting one of the screws to stay screwed into the top of my PSP and finally gave up and bought the Logitech case, which I like for the most part.I also do not like the game covers. One of the four fit tight and didn't fall off the game, but it scratched the plastic on the bottom side of the UMD. I know it wasn't ruining the UMD, but I like them non-scratched. The other three were always falling off. Totally gave up on them and am trying to find UMD cases that work."
2,Defective Items - Beware,"This item is a big topic on PSP message boards. Apparently Sony built the PSP with one of the screw holes 1 mm smaller than the other, and Pelican did not account for this. I would personally feel more comfortable using a screen protector that stays on while you're playing as well because that screen is so delicate.One redeeming factor is that the face armor comes with four UMD cases that have a really cool design. You just slide the games into them and they add very little bulk so I can still fit a couple of games into my aluminum case. However, one flaw in the design is that they cause two long scratches on the back of your UMD when you slide it in. This is (hopefully) primarily a cosmetic flaw that will not affect the performance of the games, but it's up to you whether it's worth getting your games scratched up."
3,It's okay...but...,"As mentioned several times, the face armor does have the problem with the screws. While it is worth the $10.00, it felt so flimsy to me that I was afraid I would break it. The screws were annoying to deal with seeing that one side does not go in all the way. There's a rumor that it's because one of the holes is a milimeter to long or something like that but it doesn't matter. After having to rescrew the thing on four to five times, I got sick of it and removed it for good. I then ordered the Logitech PlayGear Pocket which I'm looking forward to being that it's a complete protective case.If you can only spend about $10.00, then this is okay. If you're willing to spend a little more, check out the Logitech PlayGear Pocket."
1,This sucks,This cheap piece of plastic does nothing. The hinge broke not long after I had it. The box also says that the armor matches the glossy black of the PSP. The armor was more of a navy blue and it loooked odd on my PSP. Don't come close to this.(I am not under 13. Didn't want to register.)
1,Terrible. Don't waste your money.,I LITERALLY had this thing for 5 minutes before the cheap plastic hinge broke. Okay okay. Just a little piece broken. I super glued it back together and tried attaching the thing back on (using the two screws) and what do you know? One of the screws was stripped. Terrible.
1,Crappy Face Armor,"My kids broke this face armor in about 5 mins. I have 4 PSPs for all my children and the best face armor is a really thick transformer one that I have had on my oldest PSP for 3 years. It is almost indestructible. I now let the 3 year old watch movies on it, so it is dropped daily with no issues. Do NOT buy this face armor!!!"
4,Sleek and slim,This jacket is sleek and much less bulky than the total enclosure types. It fits neatly onto the top of the unit and protects the screen but does not interfere with play buttons. With this added the unit will still fit inside the neoprene case (available seperatley) and adds no additional weight.
2,OK CD nothing special.,"I have to say that I'm rather dissapointed with this CD. I love the Spice Girls and I think they are a great group and I was excited to hear that Mel C was going solo and bought this album and I was rather dissapointed. Mel's song are rather annoying (a lot of screaming!) and make you want to plug your ears. The only song I like is Never Be The Same Again which Melanie's voice doesn't sound that bad. I quite honestsly find Melanie better as a member of the Spice Girls. If your looking for some Spice solo material, check out Geri Halliwell's album. Thats worth buying. HOPE THIS HELPS!"
2,Mel is Better in the Spice Girls,"I'm a big Spice fan, but I didn't like this CD. There was one song I raelly liked: ""Goin' Down"" but no one else seemed to favor it. All of the songs are OK. From most reviews I read Spice fans didn't like it as much as non-Spice Girls fans.I'll give it two stars, I'd rather listen to the Spice Girls."
4,Awesome! Spice Girl with the power of VOICE!,Mel C is incrediable. This Spice Girl has always had the talent of voice but she expands her musical horizens on the roller coaster of a CD.
4,um...,"i was expecting much more from her, but overall melanie did a good job. i'm only forgiving her because her voice is so great. there are a few good songs (the ones that begin with the letter 'g'), but she didn't really leave behind the spice girls sound like she said she would. if yanni and his new age friends are on train A going at 40 mph, and lucious jackson and geri halliwell are on train B going at 60 mph, what happens when they crash? the answer, sadly enough, is mel c. if you're into that kind of thing, though, go for it. it's a great album (i guess) if i hadn't been expecting so much. it just goes to show: once a spice, always a spice. even if you can sing."
4,subduded...yet i like it...,"Let's be honest, Mel C probably has the best voice of any of the Spice Girls. And her debut is even more proof. It's a lot more 'alternative' than pop, and this suits her fine. Her voice works well with these tracks, very layed back, yet very complex. This is quite an impressive debut, and its very far from what was done w/ the Spice Girls."
5,Girl Power Symphony,"Melanie C expands upon the joyous exuberance of her work with the Spice Girls to create an eclectic and introspective pop collection that proves her to be at the forefront of musical craftsma'amship today. Her punkish first single, ""Goin' Down"" celebrates the will-to-power of an angry young woman, while ""I Turn to You"" juxtaposes starry-eyed dreaminess with dancefloor physicality. Many of the songs explore the emotional terrain of relationships, from the friendship-to-love jitters of ""Never Be the Same Again,"" to the irrepresible ebullience of ""Suddenly Monday,"" to the mystical wrath of the trip-hopy ""Why."" The final track, ""Feel the Sun"", reaches the height of pop gorgeousness; Mel's soaring musical voyage from doubt to self-respect is rapturously melodic and accompanied by a brilliantly plush arrangement. From the booty-shaking to the contemplative, Melanie C here proves the range and satisfying depth of pop music at its blissful best."
3,Sporty needs a bit more spice...,"It's good to know that at least ONE Spice Girl has the capacity to find her way out of Spiceworld and into the real world. Some songs are okay on ""Northern Star"", some aren't, but you should at least give her the benefit of the doubt. Standout tracks here include ""Goin' Down"" (Sheryl Crow attempts White Zombie's back catalogue and pulls it off), ""If That Were Me"" (the best song that Amanda Marshall never wrote), the title track and ""Go!"". Tracks to avoid include Melanie's duet with TLC's Lisa Lopes (Liverpool accent too thick to sound convincing), ""I Turn To You"" (crawl out of the disco ghetto, for God's sake!) and the monotone-sounding ""Ga Ga"". I still think that if you're going to borrow Slayer's producer to make an album, you should make it more raw. The techno overdubs and drum loops are a tad overdone. Too much of something is bad enough..."
4,Great CD!,"I only really, really liked about 5 out of the 12 songs, but those 5 songs are really worth buying the CD for. ""Go"" is a real rock-n-roll type song, sounds a lot like the band Garbage. ""If That Were Me"" is a slow touching song, and ""Suddenly Monday"" is really pop-ie and cute. ""Goin Down"" is a nother track that sounds a lot like the band Garbage. A great step up fron the Spice Girls, so if you didn't like their music, you will probably like Melanie's solo CD. And if NOTHING else, buy it for the pictures on the inside!"
3,"Good CD, could've been better","After hearing Melanie C on the Big Daddy soundtrack, I thought that her album would be great. Well, out of the 12 tracks, only 4 are worth listening to: Ga Ga, Be The One, Suddenly Monday, and Never Be The Same Again. Other than those, the album was not that great. I expected it to be harder than it is, since everyone was saying how Melanie's style was so much harder than the Spice Girls' pop. But that's okay. Her voice is strong, a bit nasaly at times, but I liked the fact that guitars were used a lot on this album, something the Spice Girls should explore more in the future."
2,i really dont like it,"i personaly dont like this cd. i recieved it for christmas 99' and never really listened to it. when i finally did i realized it was overrated, cheesy and annoying. her constint cutdowns on geri have gotten very annoying and this cd may as well be burned. i gave it 2 starts only becasue the awesome lisa left eye lopez appears on the cd."
3,Daring isn't it,"I brought this album because she is the only one of the Spice Girls who can sing. This album is pretty good on the whole. Melanie C demonstrates her talent as a singer here. Just a few flaws. One of them is the overall mood throughout. It's so morbid. The other is that some of the songs are just too long and need to be shortened. The songs I do like include: 'Northern Star':This is something special. Breezy and meaningful. A reflective song. 'Never be the Same Again': I didn't like this one at first because of the transition from Melanie C to Lisa Lopez seemed a big clash. But this one grows on you. It has a nice R&B feel to it, combined with a strong rythmic flavour. 'If That Were Me': This song has a powerful meaning of poverty amongst a background of wonderful orchestral settings. I recommend this as a release. I'll be interested to see what Melanie C offers in her next album."
4,Forget Sporty. She's the Best Spice!,"Melanie C., unlike Geri Halliwell, really should consider a solo career for good and not just for this album. Despite the different styles, it sounds convincing because she's a natural talent. Melanie really screams out the hard rock song ""Goin' Down,"" and it definitely will make you feel the resentment that she is feeling. Geri's voice is solid but has no personality, while Melanie's glides through ballads with a Madonna-eque flair. If you want some music that will take you on a musical journey, buy Melanie C. If you want an attempt to keep the Spice Girls' sound while not having the fun that the Spice Girls had, buy Geri Halliwell's album. If you like Melanie C. and are a pop fan, you might even get into good bands like Garbage after listening to Northern Star. It's that appealing."
5,Way to Go Gerrrrrrr!,"I was never into any of the spice gerr's stuff ..well sum of their latest ones such as 'goodbye'. Hey i'm off track here. Northern Star is definitely awesome! Mel sounds totally different. I'm very into R&B and soul but this album is totally fantastic! Ambient, indie, rock, r&b..gosh a bit of everything. 'Northern star"".. the second song on the album is goin to be a hit! It's lovely. Mel C is such a good lyricist! This album is a must buy."
1,Spice Girl minus the spice,"The Spice Girls breathed new life into pop music after several years' worth of alterna-dweeb drivel. But Mel C, despite being The Big Voice of the Spice Girls, has regressed into alterna-dweeb territory with this album. She needs to get back into pop, where she can do more with her marvelous voice than just stand around whining while guitars drone in the background. Definitely a disappointment, I'm sorry to say."
3,Good try,"i have to say this cd impressed me, she is brave and have a good try on this. But, she sounds too much like natalie imbruglia, as we all know nmelanie likes natalie much, so may be she is copying, especially in the songs GAGA and GOIN' DOWN, sounds like DON't YOU THINK and of course, WISHING I WAS THERE. But, she is better than GERI though, a good try instead for her, but melanie should sing all rock sonmg, not ballad like IF THAT WERE ME, in which she sounds too awful."
2,OKAY BUT NOT GOOD ENOUGH,"ITS OKAY BECAUSE MEL C. GOT INTO ROCK. I ONLY REMEMBER HER IN POP AND IN THE GROUP THE SPICE GIRLS. IT WILL BE MORE INTERESTING IF GERI CRAWLED BACK IN THE GROUP, SO THAT THEYWILL LIVE AGAIN. IF THEY KEEP SEPARATING THEY WILL LOOSE MORE SPICE FANS."
1,"SAVE YOUR MONEY,ask for it for Christmas","Since most people thought she was the ""Voice"" of the Spice girls.I was disappointed with this cd.Tracks 4&8 are good.Everything else basically sounded alike. If you like whinning lilaith fair lesbain music,buy it now! If you were expecting something like the Spice girls, Forget it.you'll have to wait with the rest of us for that third album.You would think that she could be a little more versitile with her choices of music for this cd.(It worked for Geri,I'm sure it would have worked for her too)She has a great voice.all she needs is people from her label to help her display her vocal talents better."
4,You can hate the Spice Girls but still like this....,"I didn't really want to give this album a try because of my dislike for the Spice Girls. However, I was pleasantly surprised to find Melanie C to be the lone Spice Girl with talent. Her voice is great! The style of each song is different proving that Mel has great potential for a solo career. So forget the Spice Girls and listen to this!"
4,surprisingly good,I got this album because she had a awesome song on the austin powers soundtrack and I figured she would have an awesome cd also. I didnt like it at first but I got really into it after a while.
1,Save your Money,There is nothing about the book that I like which is to say the book is terrible from every aspect but some areas are worst than others. Pictures are all B&W with fine photocopy-like print. This book is a collection of car magazine articles from the 60's and is it ever so obvious. Looking back we know that many of the car magazine articles of Muscle Car comparisons was for the most part not objective or scientific in approach. The auto makers are as much to blame with some of the ringers they provided for comparison. In my opinion you can take most if not all of the 60's car magazines and apart from some of the photos just get rid of them. They are not a reliable source of information and neither is this book. Correction: all of the photos are black and white except for the cover.Imagine that.
2,Nothing like the picture,I had bought two sharps containers because I wasn't sure which would fix in my medical travel kit. This one is supposed to be shorter but wider however it is not. It is actually thinner but taller like other sharps containers. I rated the product so low because the company could have at least posted the right picture for the product.
3,Complicated,I bought this last January after reading all the reviews. I tried all the tricks people mentioned and it just did not work in the freezer compartment of my fridge. I took it to the family cottage last week which has chest freezer and it worked like a charm.....
4,Ice Cream,"So far this is working fine. It doesn't freeze ice cream as hard as the old ice and rock salt method, but it's a whole lot easier. However, I just made a batch that didn't freeze well. I'll have to take care to keep the bowl a little lower in the freezer."
5,Makes great ice cream,"I bought this as a gift for my sister for Christmas as she was interested in making homeade ice cream instead of worrying about giving preservatives and not knowing exactly what was in the ice cream she was feeding her children. This ice cream maker works really well and fast, she was very amazed with the quietness that this product had compared to other ice cream makers that she had heard of."
5,Best little ice cream maker!,Well it might not be little but I love this ice cream maker. I love that it is not real noisy and makes perfect frozen desserts every time. If you are looking for a great ice cream maker you have found it!
5,My own 31 flavors plus,"My husband and I love this ice cream maker. We plan on creating our own special flavors. We made fresh strawberry ice cream and vanilla frozen yogurt, both were delicious and super easy to make. The machine is a breeze to assemble and clean. You will be eating homemade, pure and wonderful frozen treats in under 30 minutes. It is correctly named ""Pure Indulgence 2-Quart Automatic"""
3,a little loud,"This is a quality made product that I wish was quieter. In my small apartment it just wont work. I even put it in my other room with the door closed but still could hear it running. I had to send it back, but I wanted it to work for me. I guess I will wait for a smaller, quieter model."
1,Cold Soup Maker,This thing is terrible at making ice cream. The bowl is completely frozen and even after 30 minutes (they state needing only 20 min) the contents within are soupy and runny. It should at least be the consistency of soft serve. Every attempt to make ice cream so we could eat it immediately after has resulted in waiting a day for the freezer to actually finish the job. But of course then it's hard ice cream.
3,"Works well, but pretty noisy when running.",The subject line kind of says it all. Just make sure your freezer bowl is really cold and have at it. You will probably want some more recipes than what comes with it. And yes - it is quite noisy when running.
5,"Wonderful ice cream in around 30 minuutes,","My husband has been trying to lose weight but loves ice cream and has always had dessert. With this ice cream machine I am able to make him low fat no sugar ice cream, gelato and frozen yogurt all of which are extremely simple yet really delicious."
5,As advertised,"I've used the maker 3 times now. It works as advertised. I bought a recipe book and used the recipes from there. If you like homemade ice cream, it doesn't get any easier than this."
1,Never quite cold enough,"I've had this ice cream maker for a couple of years and initially it performed okay. I am used to getting soft serve ice cream when making it at home. The trouble all along was that the bowl is very small, so I have to adapt recipes so that they will fit the 2 quart capacity. This amount of ice cream is never enough for family gatherings. Now that I've had it a few years, only using it occasionally, the motor heats up and melts the interior bowl so the ice cream never sets up and just stays very loose and slushy. I've gone back to using my old-fashioned model that requires an icy brine to mix ice cream. It may be noisy, but it is large enough, inexpensive, and reliable. Don't bother buying this."
5,Awesome easy to use easy to clean.,This machine was everything I could hope for. The only thing that could be better is not having to freeze the bowl. Buth that feature runs hundres of dollars and who needs to spend that much. Great bang for the buck.
3,ok product,This product is good to make ice cream from time to time and the tank has to be frozen completely before use (which can take over a day depending on your freezer).
2,More like mush than ice cream,"I have used mine twice in the past two days. It isn't much of an ice cream maker. Every thing has to be premixed before placed in the machine, a bowl has to be pre frozen to chill the mizture. At twenty five minutes, the cycle time of the ice cream maker, you have a bowl of soft mush that has to be placed in your freezer before it comes close to the consistency of ice cream. This is bascially a low speed blender with a gel filled mixing bowl. My wife and I cook and bake a lot. We are not strangers to recipes, mixing ingredients and following instructions. This is not a useful piece of equipment."
3,Sound,"I just received this product as a gift and using it for the first time. Everything seems great, but the machine is very loud, especially when the directions instruct to let it run for 25minutes. It definitely can't be used when there are others sleeping nearby."
4,Great,"Used the automatic ice cream maker several times. Easy to used, receipes easy to use and makes excellent ice cream and yogurt."
3,a real noise maker,The machine makes good ice cream but the noise is deafening. We've used it once a week for a month and it seems to be getting louder each time. Buy some ear plugs as an accessory.
4,Very Good,"Pros:Easy to use.2 quart capacity.Easy to clean.No ice/salt neededCons:NoisyPlastic mixing device can be messyThe machine works by spinning the entire tub, and the ice cream is churned by the plastic mixing thingy which does not move, kinda a strange design but it works. The ice cream I have made from it has all been very delicious, I dont think i will ever buy premade ice cream again. :)"
4,Homemade ice cream has never been easier,"Fresh strawberry, lemon custard, chocolate orange--yum! Cuisinart has made creamy, delicious ice cream easy. After years of wrestling with traditional rock salt and ice, we have been thrilled to convert to this new method. But if you need to serve a big group or make multiple flavors, it's worth buying a second bowl, since they need to freeze about 24 hours for each batch. Great recipe books: Ben and Jerry's and David Lebovitz's ""Perfect Scoop""."
4,Nice machine,Makes great ice cream. I would say it's worth it but be prepared to do some prep. You have to freeze the canister. You don't save any money making your own ice cream but you do get to have fun experimenting with crazy flavours.
5,LOVE it!!,I've had my ice cream maker for a little over a month. I've used it over three times already (we're in the middle of winter here lol) and its so easy to use!! LOVE LOVE LOVE my ice cream maker!
4,Good product,"We've made at least four different flavors of ice cream since the ice cream maker arrived. It works great, and the ice cream is good, but not as creamy as a Ben & Jerry's. (Though what we make is probably lower in calories!) The shape of the unit makes it easy to store."
5,Smokin Hot Ice Cream Maker,I bought this so we could make ice cream like at my sisters.Now my sister is wanting to buy one like ours so she can make ice cream like we do.This is so easy and what is even better is how you can modify recipees and lower sugar content without impacting flavor and most importantly the texture.
5,Delicious,Makes delicious ice cream! We've made the common chocolate and vanilla so far. We've also made a Lime ice type thing and it was very good! Easy to use and clean.
2,crap,"i originally gave this product a 3 b/c i couldnt get the bucket to freeze,,, after i lowered the temp in my freezer the bucket froze and made some great gelato, so i changed it to a 5 and said it was great,,, well i'm now on my 3rd batch of gelato and neither the 2nd batch nor this 3rd will freeze and turn to gelato. i dont know what is wrong but i'm not happy,,, this product is crap and i should have stuck with my instinct on the 1st review instead of listening to the smartass that tried to tell me i was doing something wrong. its crap do not buy"
1,Misleading description,"This machine is advertised as being ""fully automatic"" and as ""providing ice cream in as little as 25 minutes.""How is it automatic if you have to freeze a large bowl for 6 to 24 hours?How is it ready in as little as 25 minutes if you have to prep a day ahead by freezing the bowl?I just received this machine but I'm going to return it. I have a small freezer and there is no way I can leave a large bowl laying around in it just in case I want to make some ice cream."
1,Great for Milk Shakes,"Like so many Cuisinart products that I've encountered recently this one is engineered by idiots. It lacks the freezing capacity to freeze anything past the ""slushy"" phase. Every time we have used it we have had to put it back in the freezer to further solidify the ice cream. It is a clear case of failed physics: too little heat capacity to accommodate the thermal load required to actually make ice cream. Years ago I had a Donvier that would freeze to hardness. It broke and I miss it. Like my Cuisinart coffee pot that vomits all over the counter every week or so this is a FAILURE."
2,Lousy lifespan makes for an unhappy customer,"This product started to malfunction a little more than a year into its life.At first, it made great ice cream. Now, the unit generates so much heat while it is turning that the bowl unfreezes and I end up with a pultaceous mess that isn't remotely close to ice cream.Avoid this.______________________________________________________UPDATE: Cuisinart replaced my defective product. For a $10 shipping charge, they shipped a new unit to me the same day I called. It shipped from New Jersey via UPS and I had it two days later. They require that you ship the defective unit to them in New Jersey at your own expense, but they will ship your replacement without first having the defective unit. My total out of pocket expense was $20. I'm very happy with the customer service."
4,This is a good product.,"I am very happy with this easy way to make almost any kind frozen desert you could desire. There are some minor things about it that are worth mention.First, the price isn't going to kill your budget but it's more than the average ice cream maker.Second, your range of quantity is limited. You can't make more than 1 3/4 to 2 quarts (hey good ice cream can go fast with a few friends over) and at the other end you can't just make a pint very easily to test out recipes.But, it is an easy to use, good quality frozen treat maker. I can definitely recommend it with confidence."
4,Cuisinart ICE-30BC,It makes delicious soft ice cream in 20 to 25 minutes and after being in the freezer it is as good if not better than bought ice cream.
5,GREAT product!,This is a great appliance to have if you like icecream and frozen yogurt. It's very easy to use and clean. There are included recipes that are pretty good. I suggest looking for more either online or actually buying an ice cream recipe book. Clean up is really easy too. Take off the clear top you see in the picture pull out the mixer part and the bowl and wash.My only complaint is that I need to have freezer space for the bowl. It's not enough to take a start away from the product though. As I see it it a something that is needed to be able to make my own (ingredient controlled) frozen treats.My 4 year old also loves making ice cream with me too!
4,"Great Product, Loving it!","I purchased the Cuisinart ICE-30BC 2qt ice cream/sorbet maker about a month ago and have had great results. So far I have only made Sorbet, but I have made 8 different flavors all were awesome! I would make up my mix the day before and leave it in fridge then next morning put it right in and wala! 25 min later, kinda soft but just popped it into a gladware container with a piece of waxed paper on the top and it hardened within an hour or two. I still have some in the freezer I made 3 weeks ago and it still tastes great, the waxed paper really keeps ice crystals/freezer burn off. I managed to do back to back batches, second was softer but it worked. And as soon as I am done I just rinsed the freezer bowl and popped it back in the freezer until next batch, I have found 8 hrs in my freezer is just about right.I definitely recommend it! I will be trying ice cream soon, will report back!"
1,"NOT Ice Cream, Just Ice","I LOVE ice cream, like I need it multiple times a week love. I was really excited to get my own ice cream maker and kick the habit of buying the expensive stuff. First time I used this, I made a gelato that didn't freeze in the bowl and made an icy consistency after freezing in the freezer. I thought I must be doing something wrong, so, I tried a different recipe and got similar results, only the ice crystals were even bigger. So, last night I tried it again, but got ice crystals. It looks like the bowl just doesn't freeze the mixture quick enough and then when you freeze it in the freezer, ice crystals form.VERY disappointing. I do not understand how this product receives so many five star reviews. I will try to return this thing, but I don't expect to be successful."
5,Oh so easy treat,"This was a gift to my daughter and family. She has raved about it from day one.She says it was so easy even her 4 year old did it by herself!!My granddaughters say the ice cream they are making is better than what they get at Cold Stone, and they don't have to stand in line to pay an arm and leg for a scoop!!!!My daughter liked the ice cream maker so much that she plans to give it to three friends for Christmas."
5,Easy Frezzy,"Almost seemed too simple. When I opened the package I could not understand how few moving parts, the opening in the top and how the mixer stayed in place. All was revealed during the first use. The opening: to pour the mixture in while the container spins; the mixer doesn't attach because it doesn't move, rather the freeze bowl moves. The very few parts I leave to good design."
5,My go-to dessert for parties,"This ice cream maker is fantastic. My sister and bro-in-law gave it to me for my birthday a couple years ago. Now I bring ice cream to almost every party/potluck to which I'm invited, and I've become famous for it. Everyone asks what flavor I'll bring next. (I made white chocolate ice cream with macadamia nuts and coconut shavings for Easter, pumpkin spice ice cream with chopped pecans for Halloween, etc.)The machine is easy to use, easy to clean, works great every time. The best ice creams are the ones where you make a custard base (with egg yolks, cream, and sugar) on the stove top, add relevant flavor (melting in two bars of dark chocolate, for example) as instructed by the recipe, chill that custard a few hours in the fridge, then set up the ice cream maker, pour the flavored custard mix in and turn it on. Half an hour later, you've got ice cream that's better than Haagen Dazs."
5,"Loud,","Yes, it's loud,but it does a great job. I remember the old days of rock salt and ice. No more, just freeze the container and in 20 minutes you have soft ice cream. However, it's very noisey!"
2,Not so much,"Remember making ice cream as a kid? Remember how you had to put that bowl in the freezer overnight? Remember how the ice cream turned out like cold mush? Now you can relive those memories- only the results are much more disappointing than you remember! Thanks Cuisinart- you can have this one back. We used a deep freezer and top shelf ingredients, and did 3 cycles of freeze/churn, and at a certain point I realized this was going nowhere. Maybe the refrigerated units work, but we quit because the preparation of ingredients is a pain."
4,I love this machine,"I had an old ice cream maker that sadly broke. Then my friends got me this one for my birthday with the most interesting ice cream recipe book I have ever seen.Space in the freezer can be an issue from time to time, but apart from that I cannot fault this product in any way.This machine does everything they claim and does it very well. In comparison with my old ice cream maker this thing is very quiet. We have tried a few recipes from the manual and they are great. The kids love to watch for the full 25 minutes it takes to make a batch. If you have space in your freezer store the bowl in there permanently, so it is ready at a moment's notice.Now I intend to use this in conjunction with my new ice cream recipe book to get some veggies into the kids with ice cream.Savory & Unusual Ice-Cream Recipes"
4,For the ice cream lovers,"Yes this machine is on the louder side, but it is definitely worth the results. Expect the ice cream to come out with a soft-serve like consistency, which is exactly what I like. If you like firmer ice cream, simply put it in the freezer for a while. The average price of a scoop of ice cream at a restaurant is extra expensive, this machine is great for making a sundaes and definitely worth the investment if you are an ice cream lover."
5,"In a word, ""Awesome"".","After doing a lot of comparison shopping, I settled on this machine for the best combination of features and price. I couldn't be happier. As was noted by other reviewers, I haven't had any ""store bought"" ice cream in my home since I made the first batch of chocolate from the machine's recipe book. Since then, I have made sorbets, sherbets, all manner of ice cream flavors, numerous variatons of frozen yogurt and even a couple of gelatos. Not a loser in the bunch. And my grandkids think I'm some sort of magician.I like it so well that I'm going to give my daughter and her family one at the next ""gifting"" occasion, as my SIL and granddaughter are real ice cream junkies. Will also pass along my favorite recipes.Couldn't recommend it any higher, but then I've always been pleased with ALL of my Cuisinart appliances, so I shouldn't have expected any less."
4,enjoyed it,"This is a space saving ice-cream maker, and is great for all ice-cream lovers (kids and adults). Of course, the ice creams are not perfect as the conventional ones at the convenience stores but they are pretty good for home made ones and the process is so fun. Sorbets are pretty good as well and is a healthier option. I enjoyed mine."
4,nice,did the job. Ice cream was delicious. You should definitely get this if your trying to not buy anything over the top
1,Roack Hard Ice Cream,"I was gravely disappointed with this ice cream maker. After the product is made (ice cream or yogurt) you best eat the mix right away. If not, when you place the mix into the freeze for storage to eat at a later date it will turn into a piece of ice block and nothing relating to ice cream or frozen yogurt. I will not waste my time with this product."
4,Fun product,We've enjoyed this product. Only drawback is we had to set our freezer for the coldest setting in order to get the canister to freeze. The ice cream is delicious though!!
4,"Hey, this is fun!","It's easy to use, and kinda fun. And the ice cream is very good. Still, it's a gadget, and I don't use it enough to justify the expense. Be forewarned: this gadget may save you alot of the work involved in making ice cream, but it doesn't do it all for you--you'll still have to do the egg mixture yourself. As far as quality and functionality go, it's great. It's just so unnecessary!"
3,Makes Ice cream,"The machine does work like its supposed too. Wish the ice cream didn't freeze up so bad. When I take it out of bowl and put it in the freezer, it gets to hard. Have to let it set out awhile before eating it. Hate scraping it out of bowl too. Have to figure out what to do to keep it from freezing to hard. It works but I need a few good lessons on making good ice cream a little softer."

5,Cuisinart ICE-30BC Ice Cream Maker,"I had the pleasure of using this item while house sitting for some friends and we were very impressed. Easy to use and the end result is great. Only four, all natural, ingredients for vanilla compared to a paragraph of ingredients with store bought. The only draw back is you need a space in your freezer to freeze the container of liquid. If you have that space then you won't be disappointed. Another great Cuisinart product. BTW, we bought this as a Christmnas present for our daughter. We can't wait to visit and see what flavor she will surprise us with."
5,We Love It!!!!!!!,"The first time or two we used it we were a little disappointed, but now we love it. Does a wonder job, we leave the bowl in the freezer all the time so its ready to go. And make sure you chill the ingredients before hand too. With the right recipes its deliciouly smooth. We like to use smooth ingredients like a dab of honey or a little corn syrup, and sometimes dry vanilla pudding mixes. These ingredients may help the smooth texture."
3,Cuisinart Ice-30BC,I purchased this machine for a gift. When my son and his family make ice cream they have to put it on a towel and put it in the bedroom with the door shut because this machine is soooo load. They have never been able to get the lid to stay on. When you start the machine the lid just pops off. The ice cream tastes great though. I think the inside part is too tall for the lid to fit properly.
2,"Cuisinart ICE-30BC Pure Indulgence 2-Quart Automatic Frozen Yogurt, Sorbet, and Ice Cream Maker","This product has no self-cooling function, so the manufacturer recommends placing the ""bowl"" in the freezer for 24 hours before making ice cream, frozen yogurt, etc. However, even 24 hours at 0F (32F below freezing) before use is not enough to produce ice cream with any solid consistency. The result in my hands has been semi-liquid on each occasion I tried to use it. Other users have had the same experience and suggest making a custard-based frozen dessert, or adding carrageenan, or just putting the semi-liquid into another container back in the freezer until it reaches a better consistency. I haven't yet tried those solutions (I stopped using the device after a couple of sloppy results), but I will have to try again."
2,Very Disappointing,I tried several of my favorite recipes with this machine and the results are not acceptable to me. I followed mfgr's directions and froze the bowel for several days prior to use. The mixture after running the machine twice the recommended time reaches the consistency of a milk shake. It must then be placed in a freezer several hours to harden. I tried cooling the mixture in the frig for up to five hours before using the machine and the results were the same.
1,Wish I had the other reviewers machine!,"Ok, first off...great price IF the machine would have worked like all the other reviewers. I guess I must have had a defective model from the get go. I tried every recipe in the book and other recipe books I've collected over the years. The machine I got NEVER produced ice cream........the results were milk every time. It never thickened, it never even made ""ice."" The manufacturer states to freeze the bowl a minimum of 6 hours; well I did that and then tried 8, 10, 12, and overnight.......same result every time....milk consistency. What a bummer! Will have to keep on looking for an ice cream maker that actually makes ice cream!"
2,Not as advertised!,This product was advertised as like new. The unit I got was definitely use quite a bit and was dirty. The unit was just stuffed into a box with broken styrofoam and no manual provided. Not what I expected.
3,Don't Expect Too Much,"The Cuisinart ICE-30BC is fine, if you don't expect too much. I had to freeze the gel container a good 24 hours and cool the mixture to near freezing in order to get ice cream that was about the consistency of a Wendy's Frosty. Unless you have a wealth of freezer space, the convenience of making ice cream with this machine is lost in the planning. The ice cream I made was indeed delicious but not superior enough to store-bought ice cream to justify the extra work."
4,"nice appliance, yummy results","I wasn't sure which machine to buy and then when I zeroed in on Cusinart I wasn't sure if I should go for this one. But, like someone else who reviewed, I went for the 2Qt size and am very very glad I did. It makes a nice amount of ice cream, so you can freeze a little, and it is still a compact sized machine. The stainless steel is beautiful in the kitchen so I don't mind keeping it out on the counter where it's easy to use. The shell froze on the faster side of their time range, and it really is good. I made the peach ice cream recipe that came with the machine - delicious, but not as creamy as I like. So, next up was Ben and Jerry's base, which is very yummy. It is still pretty soft when complete but really good... so I go with the freezing afterwards."
4,Homemade ice cream,The machine overall does an adequate job. I followed other reviewers' suggestions and always leave the bowl in my freezer so that it is ready to make a batch of ice cream. I find that it makes the ice cream a soft-serve consistency so that I need to put the ice cream in the freezer to firm up. It is easy to use and I do recommend this model.
5,Couldn't be easier.,"Mix ingredients, pour into maker and plug in. This ice cream maker is straight forward, quick, easy to clean and makes delicious ice cream in 25 minutes. Having good recipes also makes a difference but other than that the maker is fool-proof."
4,Works great but not 2 quarts,"This is simple and fun to use maker, make it a family project with different flavors. Not sure why this is called a 2 quart machine, makes only about 1 1/2 at best. must be careful when preparing ingredients because you will have more than can fit in the machine if you measure for 2 quarts."
5,The Cuisinart Ice Cream maker,"I wanted an ice cream maker, but did not want the mess of using ice and salt. I chose the Cuisinart because frankly I liked the way it looks. and gave me the ability to make ice cream without the ice and salt. I am very pleased with the Cuisinart as it is simplicity itself to use. The only thing to remember is that the double insulated bowl must be solidly frozen before you attempt to use it, and all the ingredients should be cold. If you do this you cannot fail."
5,"I was a little worried after reading some reviews, but I love it","This is my 3rd icecreamn maker; my first was an old hand-crank model, then I had an electric one that required ice and rock salt. I was a little worried after reading some of the reviews that siad this machine was only good for freezing custard icecreams, but I took a chance and bought it.I am so glad I did! I'm not a huge fan of custard icecream. I keep the bowl in my chest freezer, and I have had great reults with all types of icecreams that I have tried. They all set up well and have a good consistency after freezing in freezer. This machine is so easy!I don't find it to be too loud, it's a little noisy but certainly not like a blender (as described in one review), maybe like a mixer.I'm just so glad that I went with the good reviews and purchased this product, I am looking forward to years of enjoyment for our whole family."
4,great little ice cream maker,"I bought this unit because it looks great and the price of good ice cream is outragous! It makes a great ice cream in about 20 minutes. The only problem is getting the ice cream out as it keeps freezing onto the sides of the bowl. Rubber spatulas don't work as they're too flexable. I have found a plastic spatula, the type used for frosting a cake, works pretty well. Also, the faster you remove the ice cream the less time it has to freeze. I would recommend this unit."
4,A diabetic necessity,"Being so limited on food & dessert choices because of my type 2 diabetes I began to look at sugar free ice cream as a alternative for my sweet tooth. This product works well & is VERY easy to use. Honestly my only problem with it was the manufacturer included a ice cream recipe section on the back of the manual for the nachine but none were sugar free recipies. BTW for all you Diabetics out there be advised there is no such thing as a truely sugar free ice cream for there is sugar in the milk, fruit & many of the items you need to make your ice cream. This machine takes all the hard work out of making treat."
5,Incredible Ice Cream!!!!,"This is one amazing ice cream maker!!! Throw away the old rock salt and ice machine and save all the hassle and time that making ice cream used to mean. Simple, easy to clean, compact, and extremely well built. Makes your favorite flavors in about 20 minutes minus the preparation time. The recipes in the Cuisinart booklet are awesome, very close to Ben and Jerry's quality. Can't go wrong. Great sorbet's also."
4,WORKS FINE,"THIS PRODUCT GIVES SATISFACTION. ALL THE MEMBERS OF FAMILY ENJOY ICE CREAMS MADE IN THIS PROCESSOR. IN SHORT,GOOD BUY."
3,"LOUD, overpriced, makes decent ice cream","Length:: 0:17 MinsThis device consists of an electric motor, a housing, and a liquid-containing unit which must be frozen.It does what it is supposed to, which is freeze milk, cream, and ingredients into ice cream.However I can't imagine the components cost more than $10 to manufacture, and for the $80 price I'd expect something that is about 90% quieter; it's almost as loud as a blender."
2,Want mine?,I wasn't that happy with this unit - guess I jumped too soon on the offer. What I really needed was something that was electronic and could actually cool and stir the contents instead of something you put in the freezer to get cold and then bring out and pour your liquid in and start it turning.
2,Didn't work for us.,"I bought this ice cream maker for my husband for Christmas. We froze the container for over 24 hours, and the first time we tried making ice cream, it didn't freeze. However, instead of trying to figure out if there was anything he should have done differently, he decided he wanted an ice cream maker that freezes it's own bowl as it stirs the ice cream, instead of having to keep the container in the freezer. So we took it back."
5,Love it!,"I've only used this twice, but have been very pleased. The ice cream was ready to eat in 35 minutes. No need to put it in the freezer and wait for more freezing. I highly recommend it."
5,Cuisinart ICE-30BC Pure Indulgence 2-Quart AutomaticIce Cream Maker,"OMG! How simple and how delicious! First time using an electric maker and I just can't believe how easy it was.And how quick and easy the clean up is.We bought this ice cream maker because my husbands favorite ice cream flavor, Peppermint, was rarely available in stores or supermarkets and now the local ice cream parlor is only carrying it in December.The Peppermint is nearly gone already, and now I can't wait for the insert to freeze so I can make a batch with MY favorite flavors next, something with lots of caramel and nuts. . ."
4,Ice Cream Heavan,"I have owned other ice cream makers in the past and was reluctant to purchase another given previous bad experiences. After looking at the reviews on this product, I decided to purchase. I am glad I did. This machine is easy to use and clean. I just finished making watermelon ice cream. I typically have to freeze the ice cream for a few hours afterwards to get a consistency that I prefer. I don't think I can go back to store brought.I like the stainless steel exterior as compared to other white models. The bowl easily fits into the freezer. You do have to wait anywhere from 6-24 hrs for it to freeze per the manual. I typically let it freeze for a day. My only complaint (and why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5) is that it is a little noisy. It is quieter than a blender (probably closer to a mixer noise) but can interfere with normal conversations. I am looking forward to trying other recipes."
4,Great machine,I have only used the machine once to make frozen yogurt and it worked great. It took 25 minutes to make as advertised. The sounds is a little loud but not as bad as I expected based on teh reviews I read. My only issue with it was that the blades don't actually scrape the side of the container so it leads to almost icy product on the edges. B/w I chilled my mix before putting it in the machine which might be why it did not take more than 25 minutes to be ready.
4,bad for your waist line!!!!,"Have had my cuisinart for a week and have made 3 batches of ice cream from the Ben and Jerry's cookbook. Made peach ice cream, chocolate almond and peanut butter. on the peanut butter, I cut up reases peanut butter cups and put in at the last minute of the mix. Was wonderful.... Am very glad I bought it. My husband is an ice cream freak and eats every bit of what I make the same day... Buy the machine you won't regret it....."
5,Fantastic,With a good recipe you can create the best ice cream that you have ever tasted. This machine is well made and very easy to use and to clean. I highly recommend it!
3,Had to get a replacement bowl,"Initially, the ice cream never firmed up and it stayed soupy (nice milkshake). Turns out the freezing container had been underfilled with whatever material is in there to hold in the cold. After getting a replacement, and after being sure that the mixture was thoroughly chilled as well before trying to make ice cream, we got it to work acceptably."
2,Won't run without shutting off,"I used this for the first time today, and it won't mix for more than 5 minutes before turning off on its own. It will restart after five minutes or so, but then turn off again a few minutes later. By then, the bowl isn't very frozen anymore.Addendum, Jan 22: I returned it and Amazon was great, sent back a new one immediately. The new one worked once perfectly, but the now it does exactly the same thing. On the plus side, if I can get it to make ice cream before the bowl is not frozen, it tastes great, but it's a battle every time."
5,Love This Ice Cream Maker!,"My wife loves homemade ice cream. I began making ice cream by purchasing one of those old fashion ice cream makers with the electric motor on top (it also came with a hand crank, but who's got the time for that!). The ice and salt was fun but expensive and messy. It lasted two weeks before the motor broke! I saw the excellent reviews for the Cuisinart ICE-30BC and it was the same price I paid for that old fashion ice cream maker! I am very impressed with this machine. It's simple, very powerful, easy to use, easy to clean, and it makes wonderful ice cream in less than a hour. I love it! I make ice cream twice a week to keep up the supply for my wife and three hungry teenagers. I wouldn't be able to do it without this wonderful machine! I highly recommend it to anyone. Make sure you follow the directions and freeze the bowl throughly for at least 24 hours. I usually go 48 hours to be on the safe side."
2,Not cold enough,"I would make a wonderful receipe as a kid in the old fashioned crank ice cream maker called ""The Six Threes"" which consisted of three cups cream, three cups milk, three cups sugar, juice of three lemons, juice of three oranges and three mashed bananas. I tried this receipe in the Cuisinart and it never froze. I think if you are making plain vanilla or chocolate (cool the ingredients first) it might work, but for anything with citrus, the bucket cannot stay cold long enough. I put in overnight in the freezer as suggested by other uses, but still no luck. I am going back to the old fashioned kind."
1,"Makes an ice block, not ice cream","Unless you are going to eat 2 quarts of ice cream as soon as you make it, don't waste your time on this machine. As soon as you put it the ice cream in the freezer it freezes so hard it literally is a block of ice. I called Cuisinart only to be told that they are aware of the problem, but there is no solution at this time. I know what my solution is - return it."
5,This works great!,"Makes really great ice cream in very little time. It does not take up a lot of shelf space and is very easy to use. I highly recommend this to anyone who likes to make their own ice cream, sorbet, etc."
4,Cuisinart ICE-30BC 2-Qt Ice Cream Maker,"We've made espresso frozen yogurt and mango gelato in this product so far. Both turned out great. Lots easier than our old hand-turned ice cream maker, but caution: the motor is rather noisy on this Cuisinart machine. We made frozen yogurt on Super Bowl Sunday in our kitchen/family room and needed to turn the TV volume up while the ice cream maker was running."
4,fun treat! Recommended!,"I got this ice cream maker for Christmas and I have really enjoyed it alot! It is not perfect everytime, but as it says on the back of the Ben & Jerry's Homemade Ice Cream and Dessert book, ""There's no such thing as an unredeemingly bad batch of homemade ice cream."" So long as you keep everything good and cold, you will make great ice cream (this is true of all ice cream makers).I've made some pretty cool original flavors, like ""apple crisp"" and ""chocolate raspberry chip"". I am also blogging about it [...]Enjoy!- Scott"
4,As good as expected,"I purchased this ice cream maker and it met my expectations. I followed all of the suggestions in the previous reviews and the ice cream turned out great. Just remember to freeze the bowl overnight and if you want the ice cream to be harder, you'll need to put it in the freezer for a couple hours after you make it. I made a custard based ice cream which was super rich and creamy and I did a sorbet. The sorbet turned out a little icy, but still good. I would definitely suggest this ice cream maker to someone. Is it the best ice cream maker out there? No, but if you want the best you need to be willing to pay more money. I think this is the best for the price."
3,It does work fopr soft icecream,"My wife just send me an e-mail with the icecream maker she wanted. It is a nice unit, no doubt. But, when it comes to icecream . . The bucked is placed in a icebox overnight and is the only energy source to cool the the cream. Once the cooling runs out one hopes to have icecream. It became icecream but it was very soft. So if you like that than this is the machine for you. I returned it and bought one with a compressor cooling unit in it to provide continuous cooling until the icecream thickness meets your expectations. The unit was also about $170."
2,Not working as promised,The design is nice but the chilled bowl is supposed to make ice cream in 20 minutes. It does not. It only gets to a slushy state like a milk shake and a watery one at that! I am considering returning the ice cream maker and going the old fashioned rock salt and ice route.
5,"Don't read reviews, just buy one!",This amazing machine and my Ben and Jerry's recipe book are all I need to be happy for the rest of my life.
3,NOT as good as I expected.,Came with a VERY limited set of recipeesConsScraper blades are made of plastic and are not really up to the taskThe Pre frozen bowl never seems to get cold enough. CA reccomends 0 degrees - I chill mine down as cold as my freezer gets (Negative Eight) and it still does not freeze the ice cream well.
4,Quality,"The quality with any Cuisinat product is always good, they work as promised and last along time. I have used this item in the making of several diferent ice screams and a few sorbets and I have also made a few messes in the process. I like to try new things, change things up a little, in the process I sometimes make a mess. The Cuisinat ice cream maker works flawless and cleans up easily. The only thing that doesn't work as promised is the volume about a quort and a half is all I can make at one time, if I try to make more it runns out the top. Amazon shipping is always fast."
5,This product is great,I bought it for my elderly mother and she uses it all the time. It makes fantastic ice cream and is simple to use.
4,Frozen Yogurt and ice cream maker,"The product was received when expected. I have only used it once, but it worked great. Keep in mind in you have limited freezer space. Like most ice cream makers, it does take up a lot of space while being chilled before use."
5,Best Ice Cream ever,Bought this as a Christmas gift with the Ben & Jerry's Ice Cream & Dessert book for my teenage daughter. Not sure who loves it more! Makes excellent creamy ice cream with minimal work and ingredients in less that 30minutes. It's also very easy to clean. We love it!
5,Like it much better than we thought,"We were skeptical when we received this as a gift, but the difference between fresh ice cream and even the best from the store is greater than we thought. Will make enough for 12-16 good servings, so two or three batches are enough for a good-sized party. On the other hand, we can make a pint at a time when we're just having dinner for four."
4,Eventually it worked,"Unrelated to Cuisart, I had problems to start with as I was sent an American product which does not work in Australia. However I have been given a full refund and used it to purchase the same product in Australia.The icecream maker has the largest (2litre)) bowl so more can be made each session. This is an advantage for a family or dinner party situation. Cuisinart do make a 1 and half litre bowl as well but machine is plastic and not as good to look at.Icecream comes up well, but towards the end as mixture really thickens up , the machine is very noisy. So if you are making whilst dinner in progress best to place out of earshot. I make all my icecreams up ahead of time so this is not an issue.Buy one in states v cheap, but Ozzies beware don't buy Overseas. David Jones has them here."
1,Waste of Money!,"We have tried three different times now to use this thing, after almost a hour of operation the liquids have not even begun to freeze up!. Tried freezing the insert for over 24 hours as instructed in the manual, no help at all. Save your money and buy a cheaper brand at Wal Mart. Definately not up to the Cuisinart level of quality I expected."
3,"Great Price, Bad Packaging","I read several other reviews on this product before purchasing it as a gift. All the other reviews ranted and raved about it, on this website and several others. I was more than pleased with the Amazon price and 1st quality product when comparing the price to other websites. I was however disappointing in the packing that it was shipped in. I used to work for UPS and am familiar with their packing standards. There was not two inches of packing around the item the box was only about half full with packing material. As a result the box for the product was crunched. It did not hurt the product, but I was embarrassed to give a crunched box as a wedding present."
4,"Works well, great ice cream","I have made two batches of the same recipe, an apple cider honey ice cream and they both came out very well. They were a little soft and melted quickly but I probably should have just churned them longer and they firmed up nicely in the freezer. They had a good consistency and the bowl was still cold after I removed it after 30 plus minutes of churning so it could have gone longer. The machine is not whisper quiet but being in the other room the sound wasn't bothersome at all and it was heard but not annoyingly loud while I was cooking the kitchen with it going."
4,Great Eats!,"This is a great ice cream maker. My only complaint is the fact that you have to leave the bucket in the freezer ahead of time. This takes up some pretty valuable freezer space. We've tried varying the ingredients quite a bit, and you can come up with healthier recipes, but your best bet is to buy a good ice cream recipe book."
4,Very Easy & Quick,"This is a very easy, quick way to soft serve ice cream. It uses simple ingredients and my kids loved it. It does melt very quickly, so you may need to set it in the freezer to harden up a bit. I did have a slight problem getting all the ice cream off the sides of the bowl, as it tends to freeze to the sides. Very easy clean-up. I recommend this if your looking for pure ice cream with no perservatives."
2,big problem,"Didn't realise it would be on an american power supply, so after buying an adaptor, it blew up in 30 seconds."
2,More trouble than I thought!!,I purchased this product thinking it would be easier than making a trip to the store for a half gallon of ice cream. It took my wife almost seven hours to make the ice cream. One of the recipes that came with the product needed several hours of preparation before the half hour needed in the suprisingly loud machine. My wife and I had to stop watching our television program for over twenty minutes while the ice cream finished. It was more trouble than I thought it would be. I'd rather run to the store. Ice cream was very good though.
1,AWFUL,I have been wanting an ice cream maker for about 3 years. I finally recieved this one for christmas this year. This is an awful machine and will be going back to the store tomorrow. It never makes ice cream. All it does is spin milk around for 35 mins with no other effect. Don't waste your time or money!
1,Did not like the product,I bought this for my wife and she did not like the product. I guess we were not informed that the mixing tank should be frozen for many hours before use. It was used one time and will probably never be used again. The unit is not as user friendly as advertised - if we would have known more - the purchase would not have been made
1,This is horrible!!,"I received this product as a gift. I used it with a recipe I found online for a healthier ice cream that I cooked on the stove before placing it in the ice cream maker to freeze. As far as I can tell, I followed the directions from the maker perfectly. The ice cream came nowhere close to ice cream consistency in the ice cream maker. I put it in the freezer, as the directions say you can do if you like firmer ice cream, and it came out an icy disgusting mess. I spent all day on the ice cream, so I was not happy. I couldn't even eat it. I called Cuisinart customer service and explained the situation. They said you HAVE to use the recipes in THEIR manual for it to come out correctly, which it didn't say anywhere in the directions or on the packaging. So they were no help. I then contacted Amazon who offered a 50% refund minus return shipping for the product. Blah. I am so mad. Don't waste your money on this awful awful product!!"
5,Great ice cream maker !!,"The Cusinart ice cream maker is one of the easiest, and quickest (25 mins), ways to make homemade ice cream. We have experimented with many flavors in the past few weeks.I highly recommend this product to all the ice cream lovers out there."
4,"Good looks, good treats","I have always been a Haggan dazz kinda guy, but this machine changed that. Only your creativity will hold you back. I would have given this 5 stars if it were not for one thing, the advertising says 2 quart. It has been through many trial and error that I have found this to be a 1 maybe 1 1/2 quart ice cream maker. There wasOne time when I was able to make 2 and that was when it was18 degrees outside and I put the whole machine outside. The secret to smooth ungrainy ice cream is to get it cold FAST. If you try to make a full 2 quarts, you get grainy ice cream, or at least I do. Having said that, I just bought one for my daughter."
2,Easy To Use,"This ice cream maker is easy to use although you must always have the 2 quart container very cold. I keep it in the freezer all the time which is somewhat of a problem because it takes up space in there. My major concern with this ice cream maker is that the motor is loud. For that reason, I would not purchase it again. Very pleased with Amazon's delivery, as usual."
4,gtt1159,This series along with the Lensman series started me on Scifi and Fantasy back in the 70's. They are truely escapist and should be viewed that way. I still have both series boxed up at home in my mothers garage. I think when I retire from the military I will pull them out and read them once again. Recommended for those that like something different and I suppose old school would be a good term.
3,Super Reader,"John Carter Lite, of Rann?Or, you get the idea. Dray Prescott is your 19th century manly man who gets snatched by the Star Lords (hence the Adam Strange, bit) and ends up on another planet.Cue astoundingly beautiful woman, the need to show the local warriors he can handle his rapier rather well thank you. Add in some capture, some slave girls, and a lustful Princess who will give the gorgeous Delia a run for her money and you have a somewhat entertaining sword and planet romp that is pretty much exactly as you would expect it."
4,Transit to Scorpio,"This book is the start of the Dray Prescot adventure series by Ken Bulmer writing as Alan Burt Akers, which is presently at 37 books in English and more in German. The hero is a sailor of Horatio Nelson's wooden navy transported by Higher Powers to the wonderful world of Kregen under the double sun Antares. This book gives the reader the essentials to the hero, planet and Higher Powers. It is a action packed adventure to adventure quest, where the hero must survive to attain his desires. It is a must read for anyone desiring adventure, sword play, monsters, aliens or in need of material for role playing games. This book is reprinted in ([ASIN:1843195534 The Saga of Dray Prescot:The Delian Cycle]) along with the next four in the series, Suns of Scorpio, Warrior of Scorpio, Swordships of Scorpio and Prince of Scorpio. It also is available in various computer formats. Hi Jikai!"
2,different,"different from the original, not worth reading the book set again. it became to much fantasy without the realizem that the old books had."
3,Slight defects,"These days it's not a bad thing to promote world peace from your doorstep and the colors and material are appealing enough in this rendition of a flag . . . Lettering, however, is a little awkward in something that must be seen from both sides: this one works fairly well. The slight defect was in the grommets used for securing the flag to a pole: the center holes were far too large and required my improvising with washers. I would hope this isn't standard, but this is the way we got ours. Otherwise the quality was good for constant outside use and the price more than reasonable."
1,bla,Have watched the old movies and thought I would like but was nothing like old movie. Maybe all the movies were fake.
4,oldie but goodie,"I remember Boston Blackie on the radio in the mid- to late forties. Along with The Whistler, Mysterious Traveler and Gangbusters, pretty exciting for a ten year old kid. The plots were trite and hackneyed but were good for the times."
3,Good Genre Read,"I got interested in the original Perry Mason novels, so I decided to try some other older noir novels.This book is okay. Not much mystery and fairly predictable. For the Kindle price it was worth it. Just do not expect much of a story."
1,disappointed,"I ordered the 1986 men's Division 2 wrestling championships with SIUE winning. I got nothing of the sort. What I got was about five matches on a 50 minute long dvd. It was not even Division 2 like I had ordered. At thirty dollars, I should have received more. Extremely disappointed!!!! Now, I was sent a replacement video and instead if getting the correct dvd, I received the exact same one that I already didn't want. Can't they get it right????"
5,Sensual book about hair!,I (Lyn) absolutely love The Hair Grower's Handbook. I am an older woman and never have grown my hair long. But after reading this book I am greatly inspired to do it.He tells you all these scientific and interesting facts about hair in a way that you pick up on how much he admires and respects hair. He lovingly instructs on the care and maintenance of hair.I truly wish I could hear Mr.Longman speak on hair at a local seminar.
3,Running with the Infantry,"This is a decent compilation of running cadences for whenever you want to hit the road and put a few miles under your shoes. However; if you have ever listened to the USMC running cadences compilation, you won't come back to this one. The USMC's is much more upbeat and the voices of the running grunts feel somehow stronger than their Army counterparts. Don't get me wrong, I love the Army and respect its honorable members, but cadences-wise, the Corps has a better feeling to it."
4,Pleased w/ my purchase,My experience was very good! The TV arrived expedientely and in good condition.
5,An Inspiration to the People of Zacatecas.,Senor Aguilar is a real inspiration to the people of Zacatecas and the U.S. This is very appealing music for all.
5,Best cologne ever.,"This is an older brand cologne but it smells, manly and masculine. Be careful, you need only a small spritz which will last ALL day long. Funny, men and women will ask you what great scent you are wearing. Love this stuff!!!!"
2,Not much Masculine!,"I like paco unisex, one million. This perfume is not that great, it even lasts only for few hours.It all depends on your personal preferences when buying a perfume, try them before buying the product. i got this perfume as a gift, so i don't regret for it."
2,paco rabanne for men,"I have been using Paco Rabanne for Men Eau de Toilette for many, many years. Unfortunately, it doesn't seem to be available in stores in California any more - something about too much alcohol in product. The Paco Rabanne I received on line does not smell the same as the original eau de toilette. It's perfume smells somewhat cheap."
5,Elegant,"This is my favourite parfum ever. It is subtle, elegant, and classic. I use it every day. In the last week I have been working for more than 16 hours a day. When I arrive back home, I wash my face with cold water, and I am always impressed that I can smell myself the nice and refreshing flavour of Paco Rabanne."
2,What happened,"I've been using Paco Rabanne Pour Homme for years. My first thought was that this does not smell like Paco Rabanne. Too much alcohol and soapy sent. I read the bottle to make sure it was not the after shave. So after spraying about 10-12 full sprays on myself; the original only required 4-6 to be enough and not overpowering, my wife said she could smell it. I'm still wondering what I bought. Did they change the formula? Where/what is the original? Splash and Spray does not come close."
5,Paco Rabanne,My order with Amazon was easy and simple. The seller had a very competitive listed price for Paco Rabanne. I am happy with my product. I arrived in time for the holidays.
5,Paco Rabanne eau de toilette pour homme c'est chic,My favorite for years. I will never forget about it. I call it the classic of all eau de toilette. C'est chic forever and ever.
5,I ordered because Iike it,"I have been bying Paco Rabanne for many years, to give away aa a gift a for my husband, I love the smell of that perfume"
4,choice-of-chance,"XS Pour Homme by Paco Rabanne for Men 3.4 oz Eau de Toilette Spray, is delivered very quick, intact. The only difference is that the spray smells different as they use more of the natural component."
1,good ten years ago...,Paco was good before stuff like Aqua by Armani came out. Now Paco has a stinky smell..ewww..I dont know one woman who likes PACO anymore.
2,a resource book on aquatic life,"The idea is great, the book; too long, and too technical to hold an elementary age child's attention to the end. If you need a resource book on aquatic life for a report this is the book to use. Animals covered are: the Basilisk lizard, Western Grebe, Fisher spider, Water Strider, Water measurer and the Rove Beetle."
2,I read the book,"I read the book in German, and I was disappointed by the lack of plot. Most of the book is description, which might be interesting to local Munich historians, but rather bored me. Furthermore, the German style is exemplary of what Mark Twain pokes fun at in his ""The Awful German Language""; sentences that wind on and on and call for multiple reading in order to be understood, and I'm a native German speaker...If I am allowed some speculation, I venture the suspicion that listening to this text its meaning will be even more difficult to grasp, unless it is extraordinarily well read. Thomas Mann has certainly written better works than this account of him and his dog Bauschan - read those."
1,Terrible,"It clogged with paper from the outset. A big waste of money, lots of frustration. It will not reliably feed papers larger than 8.5 wide. Epson really should recall because of the feeding problems. I have kneeled and prayed beside it. I cant believe that it is still on the market. It is a very old model. Can I say anything worse about it. Oh yes, if it get confused, because of an error, you have got to shut power down to the house , wait for a day and then turn it back on again. If it does not feed, it will then start printing gibberish for days on end."
1,"Noisy, troublesome, lousy software","I've been waiting 2 years for Epson to post a Mac OS X driver for this and it doesn't look likely in the near future (even though their web sight keeps promising a driver any day now. It's turned out to be a real drag having to have 2 printers (one for each operating system). It has turned out to be a very expensive paperweight.Not only that, but it is very noisy, is prone to clogged print heads and blows through a ton of cartridges. The customer service is pathetic. There is literally no way to email Epson ""support."" One must mail them a letter via the postal system.It would take a lot for me to ever buy an Epson again. Even if I were given one for free, I'd have to think about it."
1,"Great printer, no drivers","I have used the printer for about 3 years and really like it, but Epson hasn't updated the drivers in about 2 years and shows no intention of updating them this year or any time soon. So if you have an older OS, and don't intend to upgrade, go ahead and get it, but forget it if you are going to be using Mac OSX or Windows XP."
5,Great.,Great condition and really interseting it is a must-have book. Its explain blow to blow how to use Phrasal verbs in many different contexts.
5,Excelent ESL material,"This is a book we use a lot with our students, it's pretty good, not too expensive and it is user friendly."
3,Rachel Perry Moisturizer,I have mixed feelings about this moisturizer - I've been using it for about two weeks and my face has been breaking out really bad on one side of my cheek. I'm not sure if it's the product that causing it because I did have some pimples prior to using the product but it's not helping clear my old blemishes either as stated on the package. I also don't really care for the lotion like texture or the scent but it does however leave a nice dewy look on your face after you apply make up and my face doesn't look all oily by the end of the day. I guess I would not purchase this moisturizer again because it's not improving my skin and I seem to have more pimples now than I did before. I paid about $12.00 at a local supermarket.
2,Not really a cucumber scent,"I was hoping for a cucumber smelling lotion, but all i can smell is the Calendula. And if you don't like the smell of Calendula, then you won't want to put this on your face. Dont get me wrong, the scent is kind of subtle, but you can still smell it.I was expecting something that smelled yummy like the Pond's Deep Cleanser & Make-up Remover with Cucumber Extract but this barely smelled like a cucumber.Pros-Did not irritate my skinWas not OilyCons-Not a cucumber scent, more like a Calendula scent, which is kind of a grassy smellI personally would not buy this again, just because i dont like the smell. I wanted something that smelled fresh and clean, not herbally and grassy."
3,oil free??,"This can't be oil-free. Read the ingredients list.If anyone knows of a good sunscreen for oily skin that doesn't have a heavy, sticky, or greasy feeling, and helps keep oily skin shine-fee, please let me know!"
4,Why two drives?,"It looks good and certainly performs like it should, but why on earth does it appear like two drives in Windows Explorer (e.g.)?!? I really don't like that... even though it doesn't really matter.Well... I'm still happy with it :)"
4,Quite impressive!,"Well, I have come across this album about a year ago and I can still listen to it today. Seems to me that good music can be listened time and again... As if it wasn't enough, the presence of Portuguese musicians in it makes it a curious ensemble of sounds! Rap, without being rap, Hip-hop without being limtated to it... Quite impressive, I must tell you!"
3,Oxford Chinese Minidictionary,"I liked this ""big-little"" dictionary well enough to want a bigger version of it and tried to find it at Amazon.com. I may not have used the correct search technique, because its bigger brother book did not seem to be there for me to buy. The review by Jeffrey Chapman expressed my own feelings and frustations very well. This is a very good dictionary for serious beginners like me that appreciate the integrated blend of Pinyin romanization for the sounds of Mandarin with the real Chinese characters there to be seen and with English words and helpful examples of expressions and sentences.A ""Big-little"" book is a special kind of book I remember as a child. And this memory hints at my age. A ""big-little"" book was made for kids and had print size consistent with book size (and shape); but the ""Oxford Chinese Minidictionary"" tried to put adult-size content into child-sized volume!"
5,Amazing!,"I am amazed at how comfortable this Therm-a-Rest mat is, even for a plus-sized person. It is so thin that I didn't think it could possibly be that comfortable. It's much warmer than regular air mattresses and doesn't sag in the middle. Several nights on the floor - and no backache. It's expensive - but worth the money."
4,Good for children learning to write....,"For teachers trying to come up with interesting phonetic words to provide for children learning to write this is an excellent source of words. This is a must by for Montessori teachers, who often need a variety of words for children just starting in on the moveable alphabet (for the initial lesson)."
3,"Definately not new - if this particular one was truly new, not worth it....","This came in an open bag - all product packaging had been removed (I believe we even received the wrong size) and the fabric and binding were coming undone so I had to sew some of it myself. It was cute and had I been to a store and got to look at it and check it for myself, depending on the stitching and such I might have still bought and item like this - but not this particular one."
4,The Night Visitor,Good plot and more good character development for Charlie Moonand his friends or associates at the Ute Tribal Police Dept.
3,Somewhat disappointing,"I was disappointed in the convolutions of the plot and felt that at some points I needed to diagram it all out on a pice of paper about five-feet-long and three feet wide. I found it very hard to literally imagine a Native American the size of Charlie Moon. Unfortunately, his fried food diet is all too believable. On a positive note, I did enjoy the quirkiness of the characters and their approaches to life, and felt they were very well constructed."
4,"The Nught Visitor, by James D. Doss","This book is typically full of the interesting and quirky characters that populate all of his books, both characters familiar and the newly intoduced. The plot carries me along wanting to know what is going to happen next and because I care about the people. Doss stages the story very nicely with good descriptions of the sights, smells, sounds and beauty of the area. This is not the first nor the last of his books that I'll enjoy."
4,Ansel Adams Address Book,"Very nice. Great pictures at each ""letter"". Would like to have had acell number"" spot. Wish they would have given dimensions - 9""x7"" a little larger than I would have preferred."
3,Ring for Doom Collection,"I enjoyed this video because it has some old time horror movies on one video. My very favorite is The House on Haunted Hill. Belive it or not on a dark cold night this movie still scares me. Vincent Price is a rich man who invites strangers to spend the night and if they survive the receive $50,000. Vincent's wife is a gold digger who want's him accidently killed. The Bat also star's Vincent Price. Money is hidden in a house and The Bat will kill everyone in his way. Horror Hotel is about a female college student who is studing witchcraft and goes to this New England town and disapears. Her boyfriend then try's to find her. Don't expect much in the quality of the video. The movies are dark and seemed to copied from very bad quality stock."
5,Great for DANTES test,"I read this book to prepare for the DANTES test in Computer Science. Anyone who understands the material in this text will ace the Intro. to Computer Science test. This is well worth the price of the book considering the test gives 3 undergraduate units without any classroom time. Additionally, the book was enjoyable to read. I would recommend it to anyone wishing to know more about computers."
3,good overall review,"good overall review touching on all aspects of computer science: binary code and machine language, the evolution of software, storage techniques, and machine operations. the book is not practical and don't expect to learn many things that can be immediately applied. also, to understand the material you'll need to do the practise problems and exercises.accordingly, this book is most well suited for an introductory class in computers or as a reference guide."
1,Computer Science: A Fourth Grader's Introduction,Apparently I should have read the review of the 14 year old because this book is so elementary that my 9 year old brother can read it. It uses examples of kermit the frog and fuzzy bears.
2,no free shipping,please don't think that the total in your cart will get you free shipping. The shipping is 3x as much as the decal and it lost its static cling after one week on a cold window. Save your money and don't get it here.
2,NY cling,Didn't get the one I thought I was getting I ordered the NY symbol but got the helmet with the NY symbol ..
1,wrong one,The decal would have been fine except that it was the WRONG ONE. NOT the one I ordered (or at least the one that was pictured on my order).
4,A great compilation...,I enjoy this album as it features a lot of Chapman's truly great hits. It's great for long car rides!
4,Great Album,"I never really liked SCC until I got the Signs of Life album. Then I got hooked on his older stuff too. I would reccomend this to anyone just getting started on SCC's music. I like the new songs, as well as the remake of Lord of the Dance, and The Walk. I would reccomend this to any Christian music fan. Favorite songs; I Will Be Here, His Strength Is Perfect, Lord of the Dance."
4,Christian rock worth playing on mainstream radio.,"Mr. Chapman alternates between praising God and exploring the simple joy/reward of the Christian lifestyle in this toe tapping collection that ranges from ballads to harder edge rock. Being a Greatest Hits collection means there isn't a loser to be found, just an hour or so of good, finger snapping/head nodding music to be savored. Recommended."
4,Good Man,"While, I'm not a ""marching in line"" conventional, conservative type Christian, I can appreciate Steven's heartfelt melodies and searching lyrics. In some of his lyrics I find an innocence that is refreshing, refreshing in this day and age when a lot of people assume they KNOW all the answers. He is less arrogant than some of the other contemporary Christian singers."
5,Great CD,"Great Cd! Love his music and his message. I plsy him alot snd he is very comforting and inspirational as well as hip and upbeat. If you have never listened to him, this is the one to start with."
5,Beautiful Dreampop,"What a find! Beautiful, dreamy, joyful, sensual songs -- mostly voice, guitar, some subtle synth atmospheres, but also understated drums, occasional dulcimers, etc. ""Tiptoe Through"" is my favorite. And BTW, buy it at C D B A B Y: you get it for less and the artists get more..."
3,Sunshine Giutar,Always a great singer of the fifties and it is good to have something a bit different other than all the Mitch Miller arrangements. I liked the CD
1,Doesn't stay lit,"Purchased this lighter based on the other reviews. The lighter worked fine initially, but after a few days it would only stay lit for a second or two and then it would go out. The ligther was still full, but had the same issue even after topping off the butane charge. I also tried several different flame settings, from low to high, and all have the same result - flame on for a second or two.Unfortunately I threw away all of the packaging because it worked fine when I first got it, and I didn't expect it to fail so quickly. I only subjected it to very light use. (Lighting 3 cigars over a 2 week period!) I would return it if I could."
2,Disappointed,"When it works, it works really well - it has a nice powerful flame. However, the problem is that it sometimes just doesn't work, even on the highest setting. It will light for a brief instant, and then extinguish. I can hear the fuel coming out, but there's no flame.It also doesn't work at all on anything BUT the highest setting.Too bad. I'll keep it in my kit (I use it to fuse paracord ends at Scout activities, btw), but will look for a replacement, too."
4,wall-lenk turbo-light,"I am completely satisfied with the turbo-lite, it works great under extreme conditions. Note- you will need to purchase butane and fill the lighter, as they can not ship with butane."
4,Not Quite Thirty...,"I really love this collection. These are some of my most favorite hymns. And Carman does a superlative job at presenting these classics to a whole new audience. But I do have a question. The title says 30 songs. In my purchase/download, I only received 15 songs. Any ideas where the other 15 are hiding?"
4,an attempt to blow away the clouds,"I find it fascinating that Carman was able to gather together such a wide variety of classic hymns that all have lyrical content that represents the prexistance of soul. It's a subtle (or perhaps not so subtle) way of sharing his someone unusual (at least within the evangelical christian world) belief in reincarnation. It seems that he is relying on already accepted hymns as an appeal to authority so that people will stop giving him so much grief in the press. If his recent experience at the national evangelical booksellers convention is any indication the criticism must be weighing on him. He isn't alone in his beliefs for sure but he is certainly on the fringes. His old family association with the decendants of Mary Baker Eddy, Finis Dake, and David Swarr have certainly left a cloud over his music ministry. I suppose this album was his attempt to blow away the clouds. I give him 4 stars for his efforts."
5,Carman can do it all,"I went to 3 of his concerts last year, and I was very impressed with his love of God and his talent. Since then, I have been collecting his music and videos. This CD is unique for him because he usually does really upbeat songs (rock, rap, clap your hands and stomp your feet type christian music). On this CD he does the standard gospel songs very well in his own style which I love."
5,Very Worshipful CD,"I actually bought this CD for a friend that I thought would enjoy it. I already had it, and I really like the arrangements of the hymns that they used. My favorite is probably ""Leaning On The Everlasting Arms"" with Chet Atkins playing the guitar breaks. Each song has something different, and I could imagine similar arrangements being used in a blended (traditional/contemporary) worship setting where old hymns are the focus. Good stuff!!"
3,"Almost, but not quite. The search continues...","My search continues for a functional yet attractive blender. I didn't make it so far as to assess the functionality of this fine machine, because I couldn't get past the ""fake metal"". The photo is convincing, but the large handle and cuff on the pitcher is actually silver plastic pretending to be metal. This seems to be the blender trend these days. But in Cuisinart's defense, it almost got it. The base IS metal. And the pitcher IS glass. P.S. Shipping it back was a bit of a hastle as the cheapest rate was $26. Sigh."
3,Bad spout!,"Terrible design in the spout. I am writing a review after almost 4 years of owning. It works well, but I can't stand looking at this blender anymore. THe spount doesn't work well. I make a smoothie everyday, so in terms of it being a workhorse- it is. THe problem is when I go to poor the smoothie it drips all over the place. So much crap has gotten under the metal part that surrounds the glass it looks terrible. I can't take the metal surrounding off to clean it either. So, that is a big problem. It looks very dirty at this point. But, I am having a hard time giving it up because it was expensive, and it does the job. The food processer part works great too."
3,"Looks nice, but looks aren't everything","This thing looks pretty. It runs well don't get me wrong. I was expecting more for the price though. In the past I have usually gotten cheap blenders from wal-mart. I wanted to get something better this time. One that would make blended drinks without large chunks of ice in them. My guess was that if I paid more for a blender I would get a better blender. Well, I was wrong. It doesn't really work any better than a cheapo one. The motor is strong, and I don't smell that burned rubber smell that the cheap ones emanate. So, if you want pretty get this one. If want to save money don't, if like me you want a blended drink like you get commercially get something else. I haven't used the food processor part yet, so I have no comment on that."
1,Dissapointed,"I thought this would be a great deal since it was two items in one! I used the blender one time and the bottom piece broke, Cuisinart replaced it at no cost. Today the entire base just stopped working during use, I am very dissapointed. I am returning the item and will replace it with another brand. I have always love Cuisinart products, but this one is not reliable. I have read other reviews that say the same."
5,Love my blender!,I love this blender. It's sleek and powerful all at the same time. I love the count-up timer.
2,not dependable,"We bought this blender to replace a 35 year old Oster that performed beautifully....yes, it's a hard act to follow.3 years and 2 months later, the Cuisinart's motor has frozen and burned out. The Warranty is good for 3 years only. Our local appliance repair person recommended buying an Oster or another brand for which it's easier to get parts. Our experience with the Cuisinart:Pros:Handles ice well.Stays put on the counter.Big, wide top glass jar.Cons:Really (really!) noisy.Metal band that attaches handle to jar slips, allows food underneath and cannot be cleaned under there.Base of blade is plastic, which cracked after 18 months of use.Pulse function is difficult to use.Motor didn't last long.Can't be serviced readily.Expensive, given it's early demise.Oster (or some other brand), here we come!"
3,"Reasonable performance, but won't last long.","I purchased this mostly as a compact food processor and to make the occasional smoothie. I have had it for about 2 years and considering the price (I payed about $140) you would expect it to last. Now every time I try and blend something the liquid poors out of the sides, rendering it useless. It is not durable and I don't think its built to last, sadly like most things these days. Not an appliance you would want to use a lot."
2,"Great power, flimsey work bowl, poor service","I was really excited about this product and opted to buy the ""premier"" model over the ""duet due to the extra wattage. Unfortuately the work bowl for the food processor is not the high quality plastic of my 20+ year old full size Cuisinart food processor, and the cover latch broke on the first use! I decided to give it a try anyway, and order a replacement part at my own expense directly from Cuisinart (it was back-ordered which should have told me something right there and then). Six weeks later, I still have not received the replacement part so am thinking I should return the whole thing. Very frustrating experience."
5,Amazing!,"My best friend and I bought this book on the same day. We were both in bad relationships at the time and this book has changed us both for the long-term and the better. It is self-empowering: It teaches you to love yourself and put yourself FIRST, because that is what men do and it is what matters if you want a man to respect you. I've learned, IF you don't respect yourself how can you expect a man to respect you? When you stop being some guys doormat, you start being the smart, funny, self-empowered, woman men are attracted to. While reading April Masini's book I finally realized that it wasn't men's fault I kept getting hurt, it was MINE.If your going through a breakup GET THIS BOOK NOW!!!! As soon as you start reading it your whole outlook on life and men will change DRAMATICALLY. I promise!!! LOVE IT!!!"
4,A Survival Manual for Men as Well as Women,"As a man, I should not admit to this but will explain to my male friends that it will only serve us anyway. I recommend this as a great gift idea men should give as a manual for their girlfriends and wives. Ultimately, it will only help us not come off as the boors we really aren't.A delightful book, well-written, thought out and presented. April Masini has broken through.While the market is full of self-help books, this title is an example of great finds made available to the public by POD publishers."
3,"Too much beauty advice, not enough dating advice","Some good relating advice in the beginning chapters, but much of the book contained tips on improving your physical appearance. Personally, I don't need help in that area, and was a little disappointed in the book. If you want beauty and fashion advice, there are better books out there for that subject."
1,be a woman and act like one,"Why do women need to think like a man in order to lead them into commitment or marriage? The things said about men seem very judgmental to me and I have the opinion that most men are not as simple minded as described in the book. To respond to the example of the Japanese business man, the author mentioned. You do not need to think like the other partner to build a bridge for successful communication. You need to respect the other partner for who he is and be compassionate. It does not necessarily mean that you agree, but you allow the other person to be who he is, while you think and act the way you are. I encourage women to be authentic and men either like you for that or not. It might be a fun book for some readers, but not to be taken seriously."
5,A curious mix,"Now, what in heaven has passed with composer-singer Vitorino Salomé, to make a record with a group of old-time performers from Cuba. Vitorino himself explains that, when he was a boy in Alentejo ( a beautiful part of Southern Portugal, just above the Algarve ), this was the music that his father and friends, all amateur musicians, used to play. So this is, for this once "" combat song"" singer, and later one of the best and most popular traditional music singers of my Country, a return to childhood. And, if you are able to listen to Cuban music with a slight ( and quite nice, I might add ) portuguese accent, you will find that Vitorino transforms some not-so-well-known Cuban tunes in true gems of the highest quality.Just listen to "" Capullito de Alelí "" and "" Contigo en la distancia "", it is certainly not Buena Vista style, but is surely as pleasant to listen to."
5,Interesting movie!,"This movie has been around for years and is well worth a look, especially if you have children or work with children. Offers many insights and a look at real life relationships that don't fall within politically correct ideals."
1,DVDR - Enough Said,"This is a DVDR, and the quality is really bad. I have a video of the movie that I downloaded. It is much better. Not just a little bit. I wish Amazon would make it very clear, with bold print, or even a pop-up, when you were buying a DVDR."
3,This special friendship,A disapointing movie which had a very poor storyline and did not make much sense
2,100 pages too long,"This week a colleague informed me that her husband was having exactly the same problem with this book as I had experienced: about a hundred pages before the ending I completely lost interest. I didn't finish it, and I didn't feel sorry, neither for not finishing it, neither for reading until reaching the moment of laying it aside. Something similar happened to me reading Pirsigs ""Lila"". Cana book that you couldn't stomach to finish be a good book ? Other readers with this experience with Harry ""mulles is vulles"" Mulisch magna opera ?"
2,chewed out,"I've read the book untill appr. page 400, then I just couldn't stomach it anymore. You can just hear Mulisch brag thrue every sentence. The sentences he makes are art, but to fill a book with good sentences does not necessairily make it a good book. It realy annoyed me that all the men in the book are intelligent and all the woman are stupid and die quickly. When you know a littlebit more about Harry Mulisch you just know that the author is speaking here. The book is very discriminating for women! Never the less, I did like ""de aanslag"" and ""de elementen"" (the elements?) written by Mulisch. The elements is a relative short novel, with a lot of philosophy and a great plot. But if he would have lengthened this book by adding another 700 pages, the result would probably have been like 'the discovery of heaven.' Not a sympathetic book!"
1,"An overrated, hackneyed book.","A very ambitious attempt at an overview of history and philosophy, but it does not contain anything new for a well-informed reader. The characters are shallow and poorly written, and the story is contrived. It seems to be a compendium of facts and trivia that were on the author's mind. Very overrated, and a tedious book to read, as it is written from a distinctly old-fashioned, European perspective (dead white males). The author makes much of the meaning of the child's existence, but it turns out to be very anticlimactic--his mission, which rightly doesn't even rate much mention in the book, as much as it is ballyhooed beforehand, is hardly worth the effort that went into producing him. All very overblown and dull. I consider this book to have been a waste of time and money."
5,A Book For Any Century,"One of the few modern novels that compares favorably with the great European classics, completely enriching. The blot from The New York Times Jack Miles with his idiot movie references & perverted innuendoes is disgusting, and showcases how shallow the urban American ""literary"" effete are. Pearls before swine."
2,Didn't really get into it,I found myself skimming the passages quite a bit. Overall the book just seemed a little incoherent and boring. Perhaps more diligent editing would have helped.
1,I never received this book,"This book was supposed to come beginning November, but so far NOTHING at all.They took my money, but no book.BAD service."
4,Excellent,"I won't spend a lot of time here because there are many in-depth reviews. Overall though this is an excellent book, very well written (even in translation), very clever, with two great protagonists and some incredibly deep ideas scattered throughout (e.g., the historioscope). It does start to drag halfway through when the pace slows way down - but then, can anyone think of a 700+ page novel where that isn't the case? It gradually picks up again and becomes once more inspiring, thought-provoking and hilarious. I give four stars only because, as another reviewer mentioned, the ending just... well, fails. Again, as with so many long and wonderful works, it is difficult to build up to a satisfying climax. A very original voice, though. A book well worth reading."
4,An odd mix of nature and artifice,"Overall, I would recommend this book. Mulisch creates a story of two friends whose lives are connected by fate and the workings of angels which is very engaging. It is also a very erudite book, and one puts it down feeling one has learned much about politics, religion, even archaeology and astronomy. But its ending fails to satisfy. After several hundred pages of what seems to be a very realistic story (with the exception of the angels' conversations) the ending is a bit too fantastic. (I won't say anything about it in case you actually enjoy the surprise.) It seemed tacked on to serve some extra-literary purpose; Mulisch seems to be pressing too much of a message on us. When I finished it, I was a little irritated and felt cheated, but now that a few months have passed, it's all the things that I enjoyed that have stayed with me."
5,NOVEL WILL BE FILMED,GREAT NEWS FOR THE PEOPLE WHO WHERE WONDERD BY THIS BOOK. A DUTCH CINIACT AND INTERNATIONAL CAST ARE GOOING TO FILM THIS NOVEL!
5,building computers easily,"This is my first attempt to build a twin core Pentium computer. As a novice, this video was very helpful in building my new home station.It was basic, which is what I needed. I think it would be too slow for computer person; but for someone without any in-depth knowledge - perfect!"
2,Just okay,"While this will give your booty and legs a workout, I was disappointed on two counts. One is the music -- there is no discernible melody, and the drums (?) are tediously repetitive. I need to be motivated by music when I workout, so I was dreading the idea of doing this workout again. I've decided to find a suitable music CD, and play it simultaneously with the silenced DVD. The other disappointment for me is the videographer's choice of focus. Many times he/she focuses on the face, chest, or upper arms of the instructor, when the action is all going on in the legs. It's extremely frustrating to try to follow along when I can't see the moves! I find this inexcusable in what is supposed to be an instructional video."
3,mmm...good,"This is not an excellent video, but it's not bad either. A little bit exagerated. The video has a ""yoga"" part that is not relaxing , the ""ballet "" part is not ballet at all..LOL...it's just a couple of exercises for the booty. The warm-up part is more than exagerated..even funny."
2,Was not a fan!,"I ordered this DVD looking for a good Yoga workout, and its not what I got.The warm-ups are ridiculous. It gets your heart pumping, sure, but I felt like a fool trying to do the moves they were doing.The Yoga section was very disappointing. I understand Vinyasa yoga is a fluid practice moving position to position, but they should have changed up the positions. They do a few cycles of only 4 moves...over and over and over. To be honest I got so bored I turned the video off and went to something else.I wouldnt waste your time or money on this."
3,"Good, not great","I have only done the first part/half, 'The Basics'. If you're looking for fun music and dance, this is not it. You can barely hear the little music they do feature. The exercises aren't bad, but pretty basic. and the two ladies leading the video drive me a little crazy. You do get a slight work-out but it's not extremely difficult."
1,waste of my time and my money,"I wanted to be able to learn how to do 'steps'. This video starts slow and explains some things about yoga, then rips full speed into dancing--wow, take my money and dont teach me first before i am just jump in. If only you could have broken the moves down first, taught them in sequence with some pointers and then said 'ok, now lets put them together'..but you did not. If only you could have done the routine to slow music, then speeded it up,...but you did not. you are not teachers. i have no time to waste and very little money to waste. I took the time to do this review because i am so very unhappy with this product."
5,New Horror! I like it...,"This book has it all if you are a lover of horror. Massey is a master story teller already. Vivid imaginative characters, fast paced plot twist and scary as hell!!!I especially liked the way he continued the theme of father and son relationships from beginning to end. I couldn't put this book down."
4,Good Read,"I think Brandon did a great job, It was A FUN BOOK, I enjoyed it and look forward to more books from him."
5,Sequel? Please? Pretty Please?,"I loved this book. I can't wait for the sequel!Brandon Massey is a wonderful writer...if you haven't read ""Thunderland"" yet, pick it up...it's a winner too!I wish Mr. Massey a long and fruitful writing career. I'm hooked."
5,Completely satiating...!,"From the very start to the very finish your breath will be caught in your throat. Dark Corner was everything you've always wanted in a horror novel- love, excitement, compassion for the bad guy, fear of the bad guy and a great ending. This was a great read and I am now a true fan of Mr. Massey's. And did I mention FEAR of the bad guy. :-)"
1,Can you say PREDICTABLE?,"The most predictable book I have ever read, which is not always bad if the book is well written with good character depth. However, Massey accomplishes neither. Some of the characters actions are very unbelievable. The main heros after a night from hell being chased by vampires and seeing most of their friends die or become vampires themselves manage to find a secluded cabin and SLEEP. The female character is interested in (...)the main character after this horrid night... Massey can endow the vampires with what ever imaginary behavior he wishes, but it would be nice to see people behave like, well, people..."
4,Dark Corners - Brandon Massey,"I've just finished reading Dark Corner. It was excellent. I can't wait until they release a movie about it. It was one of the best vampire books that I have read in a long time. It is very unusual for a book to be written on vampires, revolving around a black community and written by a black author. Sure there was Blackula and Blade, but this was in the true essay of the old vampire flicks. Massey is very talented. He makes you feel like you are right there while the story is being told. I'm looking forward to many great things from Massey. Watch out Stephen King, your time to step aside is near."
5,Dark Corner. . .Bright Future,"Many writers have broached the subject of dysfunctional families. Even more, I?m sure, have taken a stab at Vampires. Few do both?in the same novel, that is. Brandon Massey appears to be immune to the sophomore jinx; DARK CORNER surpasses his debut novel THUNDERLAND in scope, style and ambition but maintains his signature plotting and eye for the horrific that will keep this writer putting nightmares to page for years to come. Horror fans and Vampire lovers would be remiss to pass on a trip to DARK CORNER."
3,"Good book, not so good ending","This book was going along great and then you get to the end. I felt that after three quarters of the book, the author then begins to rush the ending. He ties up loose ends too quickly and I was left a little dissapointed in how this was done. Without giving the story away, I was left wondering why his father wound up doing what he did ( I thought the author could have gone deeper into the reason). It was like lighting a giant firecracker and only geeting a small pop when it finally explodes. Mr. Massey is very talented and I will definately read more from him ,so should you."
4,A new twist on Vampires!,I had the opportunity to read Brandon Massey's DARK CORNER and I was impressed. The pool of Black Authors writing horror is indeed talented but very small. I enjoyed it immensely and I highly recommend it to anyone that enjoys this genre.
3,Not what I expected...,"This book was full of info, but most of it was the spiritual benifites from fasting. I wanted more of the physical benifits. But, if that's what you're looking for then this book is for you."
1,Didn't like it.,"I'd like to think that I am a Star Trek and Klingon fan, but this work was horrible. I don't believe the author knows anything about Klingons and it seems that his writing smacks of ""Look how important *I* am"". I'd rather read real Shakespeare if this is the only thing available. Better luck next time."
1,Garbage,"I've followed the directions to a T and after attempting to connect this thing to 4 different cell phones I give up. The price was cheap, I should have known better. Threw it in the garbage."
5,Very Good,This is the first of Cheri Keaggy's CD's I have listened to; and I think it is excellent. It is inspiring and beautiful. And she is fantastic on the piano!!
3,Fair,"I loved Cheri Keaggy's first CD- ""Child of the Father""-, but something was missing in this one. Her cover look has changed and she doesn't seem to have the innocence she did in ""Child of the Father"" and ""My Faith Will Stay"". I still liked it, but will hesitate before buying any future releases. Think twice before you get this one."
5,"Just good music, pure and simple.","I had to get this through Amazon (US) as it is not available in the UK at all. I first heard of the Low Stars by catching the theme tune to a show called 'What about Brian' and wondered what else they'd done. Trust me you won't be disappointed by the rest of this album. Its not often I'll listen to every track all the way through on a CD these days but this seems to just glide by and I like every song on there. Brilliant work guys, can't wait to hear more."
4,wonderful harmonies and mellow sound,"If you're looking for grinding rock, skip this. If you're looking for a one-voice album, skip this. If you're looking for anything short of beautiful harmonizing and mellow, breath-relaxing musical compositions, skip this.I saw this cd at Starbucks and kept passing it by. I thought, wrongly, that it was a country album by Texas singers. Erm. Cut off my legs and call me shorty--I was wrong! This cd reminds me of the Eagles more than anyone else, but without the rock vibes. It's in the harmonies, that similarity.You'll love it!"
4,Good Acoustic Rock,"I first heard of these guys when they opened for Edwin McCain at Amos' Southend in Charlotte in April. We were surprised when they came onstage with just four acoustic guitars and started playing. They are a kind of throwback to some of the better sounds of the past and a welcome and pleasant change from much of today's popular music. They also sound the same live as they do on the CD and that's a definite bonus. This is definitely a CD that belongs in your collection and if you get the chance, go to one of their performances. You won't be disappointed."
3,okok,A little too dramatic in making an elefant from a fly but it still gives some insights into the matter of a minority among a different or even opposing majority
4,Great bag! Just wish it stood up by itself,"I needed a tote to carry notebooks, spare glasses, clipboards, etc. This was the perfect size for me. It has lots of storage, and that great waterproof bottom and liner. I wish the sides wire a little stiffer so that when it's not as full it would still stand up without flopping over."
5,Wonderful Tote Bag,"Mountainsmith makes great products and this bag is terrific. It is tough, it has a rubber bottom so I can set it anywhere and not worry about the contents. I have several of these and use one smaller version as a purse when traveling. The large totes are good for carrying office equipment/files and for carrying outdoor gear. Anything."
3,Not as durable as you'd think,"I've had mine for three or four months, and while it holds everything you could possibly want to put in it, it is not as durable as I would like. For one thing, the shoulder strap that came with the bag was too narrow and not padded enough for a bag this size. After a couple of days of cutting my shoulder in half, I switched the strap for one from another bag. This helped, but now the place where the strap attaches to the bag is wearing out. It's really as if they expect you to carry this giant bag by the tiny handles and not over your shoulder.I do still use this bag occasionally, but it's certainly not getting the daily use that I was expecting. Be aware that even though it looks tough, it will not last a lifetime."
3,Good Diary for Kids,"My 9-year old daughter received this for Christmas. The book itself is nice, the pages durable, the cover very pretty. The problem we have with it is the lock. It is of poor quality. She could not even unlock it the first time. We even had difficulty with it. We will have to replace it. Because of the lock I am giving it a 3 star."
1,"Cute diary, defective lock","My daughter received this diary as a Christmas gift. The diary cover design is adorable, especially for a fairy lover like my daughter. The lock, however, is very poor quality. After locking it for the first time, neither my daughter or I could unlock the lock. After struggling with the lock for close to an hour, I finally got it to unlock, and swiftly threw away the lock and key it came with and gave her the lock from one of our old pieces of luggage. I rated this toy one star all around, because a locking diary should LOCK at the very least."
1,Absolute garbage,"We bought three of these from Ace for various uses around the house. One was filled with water, the other two with cleaners. The spraying mechanism worked several days on the one of longest use, a day or less on the others (and was very shoddy to begin with, spraying half-heartedly and sporadically, before it entirely gave up the ghost.) You can get them to spray by squeezing on the bottle itself (without pressing the spray mechanism at all) though; what a design flaw! These are hands down the worst spray bottles we've ever bought."
5,A Kenpo Dictionary,This book is a great reference for any Kenpo student. It lists alphabetically the various terms used in Kenpo. While some entries are defined rather quickly others give a bit more of an explanation of the term. That is where this book shows it's worth; as a reference for the various terms and concepts taught in any Kenpo studio. As long as you understand that this book is a great purchase.
5,ed parkers encyclopedia of kenpo,"it is a great book for improving you knowlgments ok kenpo karate. totaly usefull for the meaning and vocabulary of the kenpo language. Its not book to read for like a story or something, only content its kenpo terms. totaly recomend for beginers and more advanced students, even a good encyclopedia to have at your kenpo dojo"
3,Informative,"It's a very Informative book. I would have liked to have seen some definitions of The actual Kenpo Moves with a breakdown of the belt system however.I'm pretty new to Kenpo (still a white belt) and the thing I find hardest to remember is the names of some of the moves. A more detailed explanation of them and how they were named was kind of why I bought the book, yet it's pretty much the only thing NOT in there.Not that I don't like the book, I just wish it was more suited to my needs."
3,Book of definitions,This is really a dictionary of kenpo. Well written but it is literally an alphabetical list of terms and their definitions. I was hoping for something that would explain the techniques.
5,A must for all Kenpo students,"If you are, or want to be, a kenpo karate student this encyclopedia is a must. It goes over all the terminology that is needed throughout your training. Written by Edmund K. Parker, the founder of American Kenpo Karate, a great man and well respected martial artist."
1,"""New"" Quality of Book, not what I expected.",I want this same book but the pictures were of poor quality. It seems the book was printed when I ordered it. The pictures look as if someone took a picture off a television set and then printed them. All kinds of weird diagonal lines were visible.
4,Well-grounded foundational teaching,"Provides a foundation of understanding to the church so that we invite and value this ministry as God prepares His saints for the approaching events of the last days. A good read for pastors, teachers, helpers, ministers of mercy, and every individual who desires to understand the role and task of a needed ministry in the body of Christ. Without the Lord's vision, the people perish, flounder, and faint."
4,Very Pretty.,"This collar looks very nice. I have 2 issues, though...1. It says 14"". That means from tip to tip, not that it fits a 14"" neck. It doesn't.2. It also states that it is ""soft leather."" Not so. This collar is pretty stiff, and with it fitting too tightly, it would chaff my BFF's pug something horrible, so we had to order another one. I got the 16"" this time. Maybe it will fit better.Overall, it is a very nice-looking collar, but I think the description should be a great deal more realistic. 14"" long, fits 10-12"" neck would have been a nice detail to add."
4,In an english mood,"This cd is very english---all songs here are typically 'english music', and they are well-selected, from original works of some great composers to anon. folksong. Ian gives us a beautifully calm and warm voice, and his noble temperament is incomparable .Thus the whole cd is in a peaceful and pastural mood. However sometimes his voice is too light to carry the weight and the depth of the word. Drake's accompaniment is competently well."
2,LOL!!!,"Ian did not do a good job and this CD blows. Since people are paying good money to buy his CD, I will be selling my on eBay to recoup my money."
3,"Good, but not without several flaws.","A faithless wife(Lana Turner) conspires with her lover(Anthony Quinn) to murder her wealthy husband(Lloyd Nolan). The dastardly duo carry out the dirty deed well enough for the unsuspecting hubby is most assuredly dead; however, after the dearly departed's funeral, someone starts to blackmail them. The premise of this suspense melodrama is rather ordinary, but it is given a considerable lift by splendid decor and an agreeable cast. It's slickly produced by the distinguished Ross Hunter who worked with star Lana Turner a year before on the classic soaper IMITATION OF LIFE. Empty-headed, yet irresistable Hollywood entertainment."
4,Lana Lover? You'll like this,"I'm a big Lana Turner fan, and recently watched this movie for the first time in years. Very melodramatic, the clothes are gorgeous, Lana's makeup is flawless even when she is in the middle of murder. Almost campy, but not a bad movie if you have a couple of hours to waste on the weekend."
1,A Priceless Glimpse Of Complete Hollywood Ineptitude,"There are 5 reasons to watch this movie: 1. The unbelievably strange cinematography by Russell Metty with its bizarre background/foreground, light/dark contrasts. 2. Lana Turner's first scene, a tour de force of Hollywood voyeurism: she's shown looking out a window so we can admire the back of her gown; as she turns and walks toward the camera, a mirror over a fireplace mantle reflects the lower half of her dress so we see front and back simultaneously. No view of her fabulous outfit is withheld. 3. Anthony Quinn's bunched-like-a-fist face which never modulates its expression no matter the melodramatic circumstances. 4.Sandra Dee's baffling outfit when she's shown boarding a boat on the San Francisco Bay. She looks like a reject from the set of ""Lost in Space"". 5. John Saxon's hilariously inappropiate impersonation of Marlon Brando in ""On the Waterfront""."
2,Whirlwind,"I agree with the previous reviewer. Where was the editor? And not all of the author's information is correct. Lincoln Memorial University's old gym is Mary E. Mars gym and the new arena is named the Tex Turner Arena - neither named for the Butcher's. This is an incredible story as I remember the rise and fall of this family - however, the Knoxville News Sentinel's reports were better written and more accurate than this book and that's a shame. The book is not inexpensive, either."
1,"This Book is Crap, Buy Something Else",What a waste of valuable trees to produce this garbage. Environmentalists should be outraged.
2,Disappointed,"I am pretty healthy and wanted to do a cleanse. I was dissappointed that this product did not do that for me. I found that I actually felt constipated at times, and no different than if I hadn't taken this product. I would not recommend this or buy it again in the future."
1,Don't Waste Your Money!,"The product does not work! I tried it, followed all the instructions, and saw no differences in my body's performance."
5,Feeling cleansed and fresh!,Got this kit from my friend for a gift since she told me how she loved to use this kit a few times a year. I did not know what to expect since I have never tried a colon cleanser before. I took the recommended dose for a few days and began to see increased bowel movements which was good since I have been so constipated. I began to feel liter and so much less bloated as well. My friend said I had a lot of waste inside my bowels that needed to come out and this did the job.
2,does not work,This product didn't work for me. The instructions say to take up to 3 tabs in the morning and 3 at night. It had no effect on me when taking the max.
2,Not the greatest product I've used.,Was expecting more didn't do much for me. I've done detoxes before and after 5 days still no regular bowel movements.
2,Didn't cleanse,"It didn't seem to work for me, or maybe I didn't need it. My ""once a day"" never increased, and never changed in quantity."
3,Unclear about instructions,"I started on Phase one about 6 days ago, I take a lot of medication that is constipating, thought this might help. I don't understand if you are supposed to take Phase 1 then Phase 2, or both at the same time. I am on Pase 1 only now. Can anybody help me?"
4,A music genre of its own that has been passed by,"I was amazed with the first song on this album. A blend of contemporary jazz, electro pop, and alternative mix is the best way I can describe it. This is music you won't find from any other pop artist out there. Many artists can be so easily categorized, but Peacock continues to show the breadth of his music abilities and taste in his latest album.But as with many artists, I find his choice of lyrics decaying in this particular album. Although they may be sincere, he could have put more thought into his prose. There are also a number of songs that I find rather too unfamiliar as well. But songs like Strangelanguage, That's the Point, and Rocket hit home with thought provoking yet simple lyrics and a well fit music to accompany the message."
2,Princess and the Goblins/Madeline,"The book written by George MacDonald is fine children's literature. The movie which is very much like a photographed play is poorly done. If a child saw it today, he or she would not realize how good the book is. I hope some studio makes an excellent movie someday about The Princess and the Goblins and The Princess and Curdy so that these stories will not be forgotten by children.The Madeline stories are all done in rhyme and well illustrated. However, this video is terrible. The acting is poor and the sets are cheap looking.Teresa Schoenberg-Johnson"
4,Great Movie!,"I am a fan of George Brent, and even in later movies, I find he is still a versatile actor, and charming. All characters play their roles perfectly. A younger Jane Powell shows her stellar singing voice."
5,"Jane""s Best!!! and Melchior too!! And Cugat!!","This is an absolute delight. We see Jane as an adventurous teen stowaway on an ocean liner with dad Brent being the Captain who relegates her to the kitchen where she has the whole staff involved in an ""Alouette, Gente Alouette"" to die for. Who ever dreamed that number up was a genious. We also get to hear her sing Manon's Gavotte, and beautifully as she's trying to impress Melchior who plays (what else) an opera singer. But Melchior had already left so the gavotte was in vain. Later she gets to impress him with some operatic allusions in a fantastic version of ""Peanut Vendor"" with Cugat. Melchior sings Wagner, a drinking song, and a final duet with Jane.Another enjoyable Powell musical is Holiday in Mexico."
4,LUXURY MGM MUSICAL,"Jane Powell made many cute MGM musicals, and this is one of the better ones. As with Rich Young and Pretty and Small Town Girl, these Warner Archive titles are of excellent quality. They appear to have been worked on to some extent as colors are vibrant, and sound is clear with out hiss. These are quality releases. Go for all of them if you are into this type of old fashioned quality enbtertainment."
4,"Silly movie, great singing, reasonable quality DVD","I now have several movies from the Warner Archive Collection. Both have been of good quality despite the fact that they have not had any restoration work done to them. In this movie the color is not as vibrant as I have come to expect from Technicolor films, but it is solid and not washed out as has happened to many of the 1950s Kodak Film Stock Movies. The singing is solid -- it is a treat to be able to listen to the reasonably young Jane Powell as well as Lauritz Melchior. The plot gets a bit silly and overly complex in parts for a romantic comedy, but the film is enjoyable. It played fine on my Sony Blu Ray DVD player"
3,Caveat Emptor,"This is a charming but minor MGM musical in glorious Technicolor. Even in the oeuvre of Jane Powell it ranks below her best pictures, 7 Brides for 7 Brothers and Royal Wedding. However, caveat emptor, buyer beware! This disc is part of the new Warner Archive Collection and is a ""burned"" DVD-R video-on-demand disc, as oppsed to a professionally stamped and pressed DVD. The discs in this collection have been somehow encrypted to work on ""play only"" devices and will not work on player/recorders or on computers. That said, it is nice to have these rare titles available and the quality is quite good from original, if unrestored, elements."
2,The microphone is crap.,The headset is fine. I bought mine super cheap at $[...]. I don't think its worth even that. The headphones are alright. They become uncomfortable after a little while but the sound is good. The microphone however doesn't work at all. Its totally crap and I can't find any online support for them at all.
5,the phantom OF THE SUBWAY,smokin swiss cheese there was a ghost haunting new mouse citys subway tunnels. my whiskers were trembling with terror at the thought of it but i knew i had to get the scoop for the rodens gazette. so i set off to investigate. little did i know that i was in for the fright of my life because the ghost turned out to be a cat.
5,One of my favorites,This is one of two albums that Ravi Shankar recorded with Yehuda Menuhin- the other is East Meets West. They are both exceptionally recorded blends of eastern and western string music. A must-buy for classical and eastern music lovers.
2,Niether Fish Nor Fowl,"I was very disappointed with this album. The mix of styles, instruments, and musical cultures just did not work. I am surprised that other reviewers thought so highly of this weird mixture. Maybe my musical taste is just not sophisticated enough to appreciate the end result of the meeting of two great musicians."
4,A real original; a culture icon,"Bought the original West Meets East on Angel 30+ years ago; with grooves worn to inaudible, bought CD. Recordings are real originals: Shankar was already a star in India & Menuhin was one of the premier American classical violinists when they collaborated. A better 60s culture icon than Jefferson Airplane or even Sgt. Pepper.Sorry, not all the tunes are alike, although I'll admit this music is an acquired taste. But after 30+ years, the coda to ""Swara-Kakali"" still sends chills up my spine as Menuhin's fingers & bow leave the planet, maybe for some small space beyond perfection. You gotta hear it!"
4,"Five shorts, from which I prefer ""Homecoming"" .","This volumen one made by Amazon. Is a great support for new filmmakers (young and not so young), because, despite of the great quality of sound and image, that it has, is a great source for us, new filmmakers who can not attend a film school. This way we at least can see the work of fellow filmmakers, and learn from them. Of all the five shorts 1) The Clock, by Noah Laracy; 2) Descent, by Kevin Souls; 3) Slings & Arrows, by James Cude; 4) Homecoming, by Michael D'Addario; and 5) Aquaphobia by Geoffrey Gottlieb. I prefer ""Homecoming"", because of its artistic and experimental style. The other four shorts I did not like them much, because of its arguments. But still, I think is a great visual excercise to see it. I am waiting for volume 2.Elías Rima"
5,I had no idea...,"I am no critic, but I had no idea that student films could be done so professionally. From Michael D'Addario's ""Homecoming"" to Noah Laracy's ""The Clock"" - talent abounds. I would recommend this tape as an addition to anyone's collection. BRAVO!"
1,USC is full of hype and no glory,"Having seen these films, I can rest assured that one of these lucky directors will be making the movie version of Charles In Charge. USC's film school reminds me of a graveyard with all the plaques to its great grads and patrons. These films only proved that this program is flooded with untalented ""A"" students and not real creative people. They may look smart, but there's nothing simmering beneath the cool shots they've ripped off from other films."
2,cheap,"I bought this expecting the usual Nordic ware quality. I was very dissapointed, the material is very light compared to my other nordicware pans and the yellow paint came already scratched. I will be returning this immediately."
5,A better bottle,"We replaced another similar bottle we use to make sun tea in, with this one. It functions much better and is easier to keep clean."
3,It leaked. They all leak.,I have never had much success with these plastic jug water dispensers. Some leak at the very beginning. Others leak in a week or so. I finally bought a stand up water cooler and put it in my garage.
2,Nice Construction. Poor Fit.,"I bought this hitch for my 1999 Jeep Cherokee at a local Discount Store. The box claimed it would fit the 84-01 Cherokee and XJ. During the install I noticed that the brackets did not fit flat against the frame rails, A lip on the frame was in the way. I continued on anyway checking the instructions a dozen times to make sure that the poor fit wasn't caused by something I was doing wrong. Next I installed the receiver in place on the poor fitting brackets. I decided not to finish the install when I noticed that the receiver would only ride about 10"" off the ground. I double checked the instructions and verified everything was done correctly before I finally unbolted the whole thing and took it back. I ordered a custom hitch instead. The quality of the hitch appeared to be good and it may fit other vehicles well but avoid it if you have a Cherokee."
1,Ridiculous,I struggled for a week with this so call 45 minute installation on my 2004 Nissan Frontier.It. Simply. Will. Not. Fit.Phone support is a joke. Now I'm stuck without a hitch on the day before my vacation starts.
1,A Waste of Time,"Why did I bother reading more than one or two chapers of this book? Same reason I used to sit through Gilligan's Island episodes years ago. But wait --- I'm being far too hard on Gilligan. ""Personal Agendas"" on the other hand has no redeeming value. Not only is it written in a style aimed at fourth-graders, its subplots are designed so that the status quo is preserved and nothing is changed. This is the exact opposite of what Bablyon 5 is about --- characters growing and developing like real people. Skip this one."
1,Terrible.,"This isn't a book, it is merchandising, and merchandising of such poor quality that it is an insult to the consumer. I feel insulted that I am expected to buy this simply because it has the magic words ""Babylon 5"" on the cover, and I feel a complete fool because that is exactly what I did. The worst bit is that we are actually expected to regard this is being part of the B5 ""canon"" - as ""really"" having happened in the timeline of the show. Sorry, no way. Ivanova in a wig all through season 4? Don't be ridiculous. Quality-wise, this is on a par with really bad fan fiction - except that I can't imagine even the dimmest fan writer getting the characterisations so wrong. In fact, go look on the Web and you'll find stacks of amateur spin-off fiction which is light years better than this. Oh, and by the way, I only gave it one star because the software wouldn't let me give it none at all."
2,Okay as a stand-alone.,"This is not a Babylon 5 book. Aside from the names, locations and background, this has nothing to do with my favourite TV series. The characters are total inventions - I didn't recognise any of them - and it has no regard for the continuity of the series.It'd be okay as a stand alone novel, totally unconnected with anything else, but as a Babylon 5 novel, it falls down badly. My suggestion: If you're a B5 fan, look somewhere else. If you're just looking for a bit of light entertainment that you can pick up and put down at a moments notice, give it a go."
2,Who let this idiot write anything at all???,"After reading the excellent The Shadow Within, this was a major disappointment. I just wanted to kick whoever wrote something like this. First of all, Delenn and Sheridan was way to bright after what happened on Z`ha`dum. Delenn was supposed to be filled with guilt, feeling it was her fault that John went away. In this book she shows nothing of the kind! And Londo & G`Kar... Don`t get me started! These great characters are ruined in this book, descriped in a way that makes you think it was a Star Trek novel. With such a great show that B5 is, you should think they took better care of it. After this book, I don`t know. Hey, I`ve got more talent than the one who wrote this book?? Call me next time JMS, I promise I could do better...Camilla Sanman,Nadderudveien 189,1343 Eiksmarka,Norway"
1,Horrible,"Is'nt it obvious this is not a good book. Sory Sir/Madam who wrote this book I suggest you give up writing! This book is of b-5 what I mean is its a dissapointment, I'm sorry to say. People don't wate your time with this one"
4,There are no happy endings,"There are no happy endings. Things are the way they must be. In style this book is a lot like Clark's Law, you can almost see the chaptersas scenes already filmed and shown to you. I know that some may think that short chapters are distracting and hard to follow, but in my opinionthat isn't the case; it keeps the tempo up, and helps the reader to keep track of everything that's happening in multiple places at the same time.The story has two or three separate plots. The main plot concentrates on events surrounding G'Kar's incarceration. One plot studies whatLyndisty's plans for Vir really are and a separate plot allows John and Delenn get some time together, but not in the way they expected.The events take place in 2261, before ""Falling Toward Apotheosis""."
3,Fun to read but definitely not for the hard core fan!,"I am a B5 fan, that, there is no doubt. But if you read some of the others reviews you would think there are no redeeming values to the book. The characters are a little ""out of character"" but I like to read the books to see what happened between the scenes of the TV show to see how the characters are away from the main story arch. The book was enjoyable, it was easy reading, and I could imagine in my mind's storyboard everyone doing and saying what the book told me. Remember read it for enjoyment sake not to get some revelation on the personalities of the characters. Fun, ok!"
3,Great price but outmatched by newer scanners,"I bought my HP S20 last year and have had great success with it. The setup is easy (USB) and the scans are fast and accurate. Photoshop quickly corrects any color problems. However, after using a Nikon with Ice3 (cubed) I must say that I am trading up. No longer having to remove dust and marks from my scans will save me hours of tedious Photoshop work. HP, please add ICE!"
5,absolutely wonderful!,"Anyone who enjoys country, gospel or those old hymns from church will love this collection!"
4,"Not Too Bad,","The Fisrt cd is alot better than this one, but this one is still okay. I only Liked one song on this disc and it is. Track 4. Will The Circle Be Unbroken/I'll Fly Away/ Jesus Loves Me. Don't get me wrong the music is beautiful, but i think the first one is alot better."
4,A lovely little doggy,"My sons got this cute doggie from their grandma when my older son was almost 3 and my younger son was almost 1. It's not the most played with toy in the house, but it is played with consistently. My younger son (now almost 2) loves to take Waggy, as they named him, for walks around the house. My older son (now almost 4) likes to clip the leash on and off the collar, and practice being a vet on Waggy. About six months ago, my older son was very into 101 Dalmations, and Waggy was a big favorite, and temporarily re-named Pongo.I love wooden toys, and this is no exception. This toy has weathered perfectly, still looking like the day they got it even though it's been doctored, and dragged down the stairs :0)"
1,Minus 5 Stars,"This show is only funny for infants or people suffering from severe brain damage.The fact that it has the name MAD on it means nothing. MAD TV at least had a FEW good bits to it, however this show seems to be ""written"" by former SNL writers who were fired because the sketches they came up with bombed.The ""comedy"" is so puerile, it makes the jokes on the side of a Happy Meal box look complex.This show wants to pass off as being for children, and I agree. That is if Sesame Street is too advanced for your child.Scratch that, I don't think this diarrhea of a show is worthy to be viewed by anyone, living or dead...although I'm sure that if you did sit a dead person down to watch this show, it would bring them back to life just long enough to switch the TV off."
2,"Not Bad For Kids,I Guess","There are definately worst out there(Fanboy and Chumm Chumm)but it isnt for me.I love Mad Magazine and read it every time it comes out and while i like the spy vs. spy and the don martin parts i dont like the movie parodies as much as in the magazine.Dont get me wrong.The show is alright,just not my cup of tea."
5,Over It - Step Outside Yourself,"Stolen from another site and I agree with it to the T.""The best way to describe Over It's major label debut Step Outside Yourself is as a giant coming out party for everyone involved. The vocals are strong and impressive, the lyrics are poignant and refreshing, the guitars are predominately displayed, the bass is powerful, the drums blistering, and the production flawless. Every single aspect of this album is a step above everyone's past work and in reaching this new plateau the album sits a step above their peers as well.The time is ripe, the stage is set, and the curtains drawn. If there was ever a time when the phrase ""the next big thing"" was perfectly fitting - that time would be now."""
2,Bummer,"Not sure if this other reviewer has been a long time Over it fan or not but this album was a diappointment...pure and simple. ""Against the Grain"" is good along with a couple of so-so's. Point is, Over it is an awesome band, especially their early-mid work ie)Timing is everything. I was unbelievably stoked to get this and preordered it only to be crushed. Anyone agree with me? Maybe it needs more listens but I just can't get into it. I can only hope this is just a misfire."
4,"Good performance, but....","Argerich made a few mistakes! The obvious one is in the last few bars of the Franck finale. (too bad!) In the first exposition of the theme in the 2nd movement (Franck), Argerich also failed to maintained a steady tempo, which is essential. Moreover, the melodic line is not brought up consistently. I wonder if Argerich actually practiced for this performance!"
3,For Winchester interests beyond firearms,"If there is an interest in all manner of Winchester products, ""Standard Catalog of Winchester"" is an okay black and white price catalog of all sorts of items sold under the Winchester name. Even if you are not a Winchester collector, the contents are interesting to thumb through.The firearms section is approximately 120 pages, which are virtually the same Winchester pages that appear in other Krause Publications such as ""The Standard Catalog of Firearms"" and ""Fladerman's..."", only expanded though the use of larger versions of the same pictures and illustrations. I only mention this duplication of content because, if you already have any of these other Krause publications, this book does not offer expanded or new information relating to firearms."
3,Amazon did not stock the same item,"When ordering this item from Amazon. I got best price but have to return it and re-order from other online dealers. The reason? Amazon sent me two different looking rotors. After contacting the CEO of the manufacturing company, it looked that Amazon stocked some really old stock that the company is not selling anymore. To be safe, I have to return these and pay a higher price to get the correct items from other source. I am lucky that I don't need these parts in a hurry, otherwise it will be much worse."
4,Did the Job,"I took this player on a long road trip to disneyland, so that my daughter would have something to do along the way. It worked great, no skipping, played any disc that was put into it. Only negative was it's built in speakers were to quiet, but if you used the supplied headphones, it was very loud."
1,What happened to my item?,I ordered my book in December before my Spring semester started. It showed on here that I would receive the book between the 8th and the 26th of January. I have still yet to receive it.
5,An Experience,This novel will take you through every range of emotion and you'll feel like you're going through everything right along with the characters.
5,On of my all time favorites,"This book is wonderful! This was my first Deborah Smith book and I feel it is her best. She is a great writer and I enjoy everything she writes, but this one is just so detailed and the characters completely developed. I felt like they were friends."
4,Love Story,I really enjoyed this love story. I had a hard time putting my kindle down. Loved the innocence of it. Sweet writing...
5,I wonder why this wonderful book is not on the best sellers list?,If ever a book deserved more publicity and hipe this is it. I was hooked from the first line until the last. This is a great read. Buy the book and read it on vacation!
5,I cannot wait for her next book to be available,I could not put this book down. It was meant to at least last a week and I finished it the first day. Claire's courageous spirit to help Roan captured my heart and my soul. I have passed this book on to friends as my #1 book for the summer. I can't wait for the next one!
5,This book holds my heart in the palm of it's hand.,"I will never forget this book, I simply fell in love with the thought of having a love like the one within these pages. I only wish everyone had an appreciation for life in which I had when reading this book."
2,"First half great, second half dull","I loved the first half of the book. The second half was more like a typical romance novel. I was amazed to find other reviewers felt like I did, the second half was a huge disappointment."
3,Struggled through Part 2,"The beginning, of the book I found very interesting, and it seemed like a promising book. I enjoyed the ""Southerness"" of the story, but, oh boy, after the two main characters grew up the storyline drug on and on and on and on.. you get the point. Sorry, but I give it 3 stars."
3,Great at first but then.....,"I really enjoyed the first half of this book so maybe that's why the second half was so disappointing. Once the main characters became adults, this book just wasn't worth reading anymore. However, since the first half was so enjoyable, I will be looking for another book from this author."
5,No book has ever compared to this one,"Every book I have read since A place to call home has fallen short. It grips your heart and makes you believe every character is real and you cheer for them, hurt for them and laugh at them. It is no doubt the best book I have ever read."
2,What happened?,"Part one of this book was absolutely riveting! The characters were so well drawn, unique. The plot was excellent. I simply could not put it down. Then came part two. What happened here? The book became sappy, and dull. The characters began to really let the reader down. I really am trying to figure out if the author got bored with her writing, or perhaps I missed something. This book is only worth half the price. I can't even bring myself to share this one with a friend. Ms. Smith has talent. Maybe she should try again."
3,Let down halfway through,"The beginning of this book was truly wonderful. There were some laugh out loud funny parts (the Easter scene had me laughing until I cried). The characters were well drawn and enchanting. I was even compelled to read through Clair's stint as a reporter. But when Roan came back, I was left scratching my head. I lost interest quickly in the drama of whether or not Roan would forgive Clair's family. Add to that Matthew's parentage...What difference did it make which one of them had fathered him? I agree with the reviewer who said that Ms. Smith has talent. Next time I read one of her novels, I hope it lasts all the way through the book."
5,Such a moving book,"A Place to Call Home is one of the BEST books I have read so far! I loved it! It was so good, I absolutley could not put it down. This beautifully written book has left a mark in my heart, because it was touching and showed what can be accomplished through true love. I would definanlty reccommend it."
5,It was THAT good!,"I didn't want to finish this book, so I read it slowly (which was difficult to do because I wanted more!). This is one of my all time favorites. Enjoy!"
3,Unusual - Essentially Anti-war film,"This is a very curious film - although released in 1934, the story must have been written and planned before the National Socialists came to power in Germany, almost certainly conceived at the height of the initial revulsion at the Great War in the late 1920s and at the time of the emergence of revisionist historical literature, e.g. Sidney B. Fay's The Origins of The World War (1928, rev. 1930).Clearly an anti-War film, focusing negatively on the anti-German prejudice in the US which built after the Lusitania sinking and its effects on good people, and sympathetically portraying the Germans as patriotic to their own country rather than as the Evil Hun of Allied war propaganda.This film is thus very much a period piece. The acting is competent enough, but despite its significance as an historical document with respect to American attitudes towards Germany and the War, it is a small film."
3,A little missing.,"I have been told that the original release was 71 mins long. DVD is only 58. Does seem to be holes in story line several times. Quality poor at best, but in it's defense, it hasn't been remastered."
4,Neophye lawyer fights office sabotage and romance.,"Tonya Locksley has graduated from law school and accepted aposition with one of the most prestigious law firms in Dallas,Reynolds & Freeman. She is determined to put the negative things behind her such as the betrayal by her fiancé and her brother's drinking. It is not her intention to become involved with anyone, but when Mr. Freeman's son, Dexter, comes to work for the firm, she is immediately attracted to him and he to her. Dexter still has a home in Atlanta where his ex-wife Melissa lives. Eventually, things come to a head when Tonya and Dexter break-up and rumor has it he is remarrying Melissa. Tonya discovers she must make a decision that will change her life forever while battling family problems, her best friend's betrayal, and office sabotage."
5,I love it!,I LOVED THIS BOOK! so much that after I finished it the next day I read it again. This is a must read.
4,Slow starting but definitely in the running..,"Ms. Lee has created a pretty good story after initially some doubtful quick turns and ambiguous leadings. By the time Tonya finds out she's pregnant, I was as hooked as any good soap-opera crazed fan. The characters were flawed like ""real people"". The only point of contention with this book is the total homophobic and sexist treatment of David, particulary by Tonya. Overall an enjoyable love story; girl-gets-boy story."
4,Very nice work!!,"For Lee's first novel, she really did a nice job. I enjoyed reading about Tonya and Dexter's love story. Don't you just love it when a couple preveils when other family members do not want them to be together. Good Read!"
3,Too Much Telling and Not Enough Showing,"First I must commend the author for her debut novel For Love's Sake. It has an interesting storyline (woman falls for a man whose father prefers his son's ex-wife), however, I didn't like the STYLE in which the story was told. I guess my biggest problem is how so many lines were written that tells the obvious. The story doesn't allow the reader to figure out what's going on. It just about drove me nuts. Other than that, I did like the story and I look forward to other writings by the author."
4,"I'll suck up too, just not as much.","Voice: checkBeats: checkGirl sprawled out on cover art: checkOkay, it's all here, and it sounds quite good. It's not the culmination of everything good in the universe, but if you like softly sung words to excellent music, then you should enjoy. Hooverphonic is quite similar, you might look at them too."
2,Flimsy,"This bag looks nice and cushy (and red), but when it arrived it seemed like a cheap piece of cardboard covered in plastic, and was black (not red). The only reason I'm giving it 2 stars is that, when I sent it back, I promptly received a refund."
1,Just a history - not what I wanted,"From the synopsis of this book I thought it would have a how-to section or a schedule of cleaning for the clueless or novice housekeeper. This is a history of housekeeping as well as some of the methods used. It is also a compilation of historic antedotes as well as bits and pieces from literature.Overall I am extremely disappointed. One synopsis compared this book to 'The Joy of Cooking' yet there is nothing in here about schedules, routines, or how-to."
5,A great book for music fans,"Mr. Muir writes with such enthusiasm and intrigue that the reader feels as if he/she is at one of the concerts. Dylan is still a very vital entertainer, even in his old age, who still performs world-class rock concerts and releases wonderful albums. One only has to read Mr. Muir's chapter on Prague 1995 to see that this is a book for music fans, as well as Bob Cats."
1,Zero Perspective,"Let's say someone's written a book about Frank Sinatra's last concerts, and you get to read about, oh, his various renditions of ""My Way,"" with copious notes of how the author and his friends got to concerts, what THEY thought of his ""New York,"" last February in Montreal. Very, very boring. Bob Dylan's a deeply enigmatic figure, granted, and his elusiveness is grounds for publishing anything, everything about the man, theoretically. But this honest, well-intentioned book offers absolutely no perspective about the nuances of the concerts, the performers, the crowd, just flat, common fandom. We need a lot more, if we're that curious, and itisn't here...give it a pass."
4,Moen Water Filter,Product received timely. Filter is as advertised and fits into existing Moen faucet. Indicator on faucet is supposed to turn green after five minutes. After a month we are still waiting for light to turn green but water tastes fine.
4,Funny and enlightening,Reading this book is like sitting down with Regis and listening to him tell you stories. You will be able to look deeper into the man that engages in Host Chat with Kathie Lee everyday. This book is an example of how far Regis really came in life and how hard he had to work for it. This can almost be a self-help book in a way because it portrays the commitment to excellence put forth by Regis to achieve his dream....and did he ever!
3,My thoughts refer to the unabridged audiobook,"Regis is one of my favorite celebrities! He is a down-to-earth family man who approaches life with good humor and a likeable manner. I enjoyed accompanying him as he talked through some typical days in his very busy life. Listening to him more than a decade after he shared these reflections gave the story an outdated feel, as a lot of the pop-culture personalities he mentions have disappeared from the scene, and the old-timers he reminisced about are way before my time. As well, now that he is paired with Kelly Ripa, he seems younger, hipper and more light-hearted than he was at the time he recorded this memoir. She brings out something special in him that Kathie Lee never did.The book is a nice representation of the entertainment business and pop-culture, made all the better when expressed by a personable and respected celebrity like Regis."
3,Can't Judge This Book By It's Cover,"This book has a misleading title. It is not really a handbook,except in that it may be held with your hands. The image it sends isthat it is a self publishing manual, like Dan Poynter and others have written. It's not, so don't be fooled.This book is a collection of stories about self publishers and self published works. At that, I found it to be interesting, and a worthwhile read. But if you are expecting it to be something else you may well be disappointed.Imagine buying a Repair Your Own Car Handbook, and finding it to only contain stories of others who have repaired their cars. The misleading title scenario here is essentially the same."
3,Can't Judge This Book By It's Cover,"The title is an injustice to potential buyers. This is not a how-to book. This is not a handbook (except in the sense that it may be held with your hands).This is a book with many accounts of books which have been self published, and the people who have self published them. As such, you may find some value or interest in this book. Do not, however, confuse it with The Self Publishing Manual by Dan Poynter (which really is a self publishing manual/how-to/handbook etc).The material covered is old, (some of it really old-like Thomas Paine, William Blake, and Walt Whitman). This book is potentially interesting, but don't let it catch you by surprise."
1,Disappointing,"A sloppy book. Not at all scholarly, although the author is a professor - basically this book consists of lists of pop culture items (films, TV shows, comics, etc.) with some Lovecraft connection. Some of the items are reviewed, but the reviews are very uncritical. The lists are arbitrary and leave out many obvious items. For example, the section on music goes on at some length about the late 60s/early 70s group H. P. Lovecraft, but that's the whole section.The author's understanding of Lovecraft seems to derive from August Derleth - he shows no signs of being conversant with recent Lovecraft scholarship. Lovecraft enthusiasts may find some pop culture references with which they were unfamiliar, but otherwise I can think of no reason to buy this book."
3,Uniden DECT 6.0 Phones,THe phones work ok. Range is not the best. Clarity is good. Features are limitted. Company tech support response to questions is slow.
2,Not entirely impressed,"Who was in charge of the binding? Seriously, did ya'll run out of glue at the book-making factory or something? I am about three weeks into the semester with a new book that is falling apart...and I'm not the only one! Several others in class are having the same problem: pages falling out like leaves dropping off a diseased tree. Fifty dollars should buy me a text that lasts longer than three weeks. Ridiculous.In addition, the speakers on the audio CD sometimes talk so fast that I have an extremely hard time discerning syllables and tones. Not ideal for starting out on a language where tone can mean the difference between a compliment and an insult.Two stars."
5,The Quest: A Journey of Spiritual Rediscovery,"I have only read a few chapters, however, I love this book. You read a chapter and then stop for a day to let the information sink in. I've ready many books about Spirituality and always enjoy a new perspective... I am partial to Unity books because they inform you while challenging you to drawl your own conclusion vrs telling ppl what they have to think."
2,disappointed,"I've purchased used books here frequently and have always received something that looked almost new. This time I went to the link for books beginning at a penny and I guess you get what you pay for. There is a yard sale sticker with ""2.00"" on the cover that won't come off. There was a sticker on the spine that was removed before I received the book but which pulled off the cover. The book is slightly ""fanned"", like it had been shoved between two other books. And the cover is worn and curled at the corners. I like to keep my books and I'll never purchase from the ""penny counter"" again."
2,not her best,"I must say this book was way below Susan Andersens usual level of writing. The plot was filled with holes. The sincerity and intelligence of the hero were questionable with regards to him rescuing his kidnapped sister. His actions seemed to be at direct odds with insuring her safe return. The characters were otherwise likable, but the plot was just too weak to hold my interest. Hopefully her next book will be back up to her usual standards"
5,Lucky You! Exactly as written on the back cover - I agree.,"How can you even start a Susan Andersen without being prepared to spend the night (or in my lucky case 4-5 hours). Lily Morrisette is the epitome of sexy, curvy, lady with a sugar-daddy type. It's so difficult for men to see underneath; hard working, smart, money of her own etc. And funny! Zach Taylor about blows her high heels off when she meets him, but she is very frustrated by his seeming preoccupation with halting his little syster Glynnis' wedding - to a man he's never met but has pre-judged.This is perhaps the best Susan Andersen I remember. You'll put it on your keeper shelf and never let it go."
3,"Fun, but uneven.","The Good:The story about a fake kidnapping and the revitalization of two of the secondary characters' marriage, and the revenge story were all good.Witty banter, humor, and a little steam.The Bad:The descriptions of the heroine made it seem like she was stuck in the 1980s, even though the book's from 2003. Ironed designer jeans with stiletto heels? Maybe this is cutting edge fashion, and maybe most 30-somethings dress like this & do big hair & makeup to hang out around the house.The hero made a stupid assumption about the heroine & stuck with it despite all evidence to the contrary, which always makes me mad.The Verdict:A good editor could make this a 5-star book."
4,my first book by this author,This novel is entertaining and well-written; I would have enjoyed it more without the language and the explicit sex.
5,Cool Documentary Style Zombie Book,"Max Brooks takes a well written and realistic ""documentary style"" approach to the zombie genre. I enjoyed many of the stories and I liked how the novel engaged the impact of the zombie infestation on a global basis. A very good read. I also recommend two other very good zombie booksThe Dead Walk Diaries: NightandDay by Day Armageddon (A Zombie Novel)"
2,Fun Book but not great.,"I started it once a few years ago and set it aside but The Walking Dead on TV made me pick it up again. I enjoyed it but i do not think its great. The style is original. A bunch of seperate stories without a cohesive story line. That's what i did not care for. I know that a lot of people like the style of the book but to me, it felt incomplete. Like there was no true beginning or true end. There wee no main characters. No one to root for. It was just a bunch of small vingettes. Too many questions left. How did it start? How did it spread so fast? How did the dead manage to live under water without being crushed by the presure? It was an enjoyable book but left me feeling like there should have been more. Oh well."
3,Unique idea,"Its not the easiest flowing book I've ever read but if you like zombie flicks and books, give it a try."
3,Worthy Read for Zombie Lovers,"A fun read that has a bit of difficulty maintaining a tone. Is this serious, sometimes its very serious, at others a bit comicbooky - as the narrative of war against the undead unfolds we have some rather uneven snap shots - but the highs definitely outweigh the lows. Recommend reading for Zombie or survival fiction enthusiasts."
3,"Very entertaining, surprisingly educational","I really liked this book. I loved the Passage by Justin Cronin, and this reminded me a bit of that book. It was written in an interview format it so was disturbingly realistic. What was an unexpected bonus was how much I learned while reading the book, and not about Zombies. So many historical references sent me to Google to look them up; an example is the segment that dealt with a siege of a castle. The character being interviewed mentioned many actual castles and I had to look each one up. Very fun and interesting reading. Think I will have to read the precursor The Zombie Survival Guide. And the most surprising thing? The author OS Max Brooks, Mel Brooks' son!"
3,great ideas but ...,Thought the idea was good and the format interesting but somehow it just missed. Shame since it could have been brilliant.
3,Impressive World View but Not Much Zombie Action,"This review is from the AUDIOBOOK, which is very well done. The many characters from all over the world are played by actors such as Alan Alda, John Torturro, and many others, and their performances are great. As far as the book goes, I was impressed by the many angles explored in the book, as far as world view. The Zombie apocalypse is seen from some truly creative angles. BUT, the zombies as described didn't seem to warrant much threat. They are slow, stupid, and can't even open a car door. They are slaughtered until they are stacked like wood twenty feet deep. Supposedly, these impotent Zombs overwhelm the US military at the start of the war. Um-hmm. Entertaining book, nevertheless, especially the AUDIOBOOK."
2,A huge let-down.,I was really disappointed with this book. It was almost as dry as a zombie's left elbow. It could have been so much more! If you are looking for a good zombie book I highly recommend the Zombie Survival GuideThe Zombie Survival Guide: Complete Protection from the Living Dead
3,World War Z - Max Brooks,"First off, I enjoyed this book. Fans of zombie lit will enjoy this book. The book is written as a documentary of interviews with survivors of a zombie plague and as such the book is really best described as a collection of short stories. In most short story collections a few really stand out and a few are forgettable. I found this to be true with this tale. The drawback to this style of storytelling is that the potential to love or hate characters never completely develops and ultimately you move on to the next scene and start over. The stories are not interrelated other than the fact everyone is dealing with zombies which adds to the short story collection feel. It's a zombie tale, there is plenty of gore and thrills, enjoyable read for zombie fans."
2,Not deep enough,This book got great reviews and that drew me in. The whole reporter dialog just didn't do it for me. By the time the stories got interesting they were switching to someone else's story on the other side of the globe. None of the stories ever came together no relation of the characters. Just a collection of open ended shorts. I did enjoy the detail of the virus and how the outbreak began but ended up just putting the book down unfinished.
5,Loved this book!,"Have you ever wondered what our world would look like after a major worldwide crisis? I don't mean a small localized event, I mean some catastrophe that touched the entire planet. The stories in this book, while obviously dealing with the living dead, are rich with a surprising amount of details, and real-life scenarios that could very easily apply to a pandemic, or some other wide scale event. The author took the time to do his research and it shows. Entertainment no doubt, but many of these stories remind us just how disconnected many people have become from reality. The very things that have made life so easy and convenient for so many in the 21 century, have become the Achilles Heel that might one day bring it all crashing down. I enjoyed this book and was sorry when I reached the last page."
4,Good book,This was a good book and a fast read. I really liked the individual stories though I must admit I liked the stories that took place in the U.S. the most (since I'm American). The descriptions are so vivid that you imagine exactly what the speaker is describing. This is still a scary zombie book but a bit different since it describes a lot of military responses across the world when the zombie outbreak happens.
3,World War Z,Good book. A little scattered. Drawn out in some parts butoverall I enjoyed it. Some stories we're difficult to follow.
4,Good read,Gripping. Interesting way to use interviews as a method of telling a story. Will be interested in seeing the movie next year.
3,A new take on the zombie apocalypse.,If you want to read an exciting action zombie splatter-fest you will be disappointed. This reads like a collection of survivor stories years after the war with the undead. Still good but not what I expected. Was hard to develop feelings for characters you spend only a few moments with before it was on to another interview.
4,World war Z,I hope the up comingmovie will come close to the book. The walking dead from all sides beginning to end.
4,Fun,It is a coherent history about a zombie outbrake in our world. Brooks is a good narrator on this fictional tale
2,Disappointed.,"I'd been told by a few friends that since I found zombie fiction interesting, I should read this book.I was incredibly disappointed.I bought this book thinking it was going to be an exciting, tense and horror-filled story of the apocalypse. What I didn't expect was for it to be 1% about zombies and 99% about politics. Why not just call it, ""World War Everything That's Wrong With the Government in Every Part of the World""? So. Incredibly. Boring."
4,Cool concept,"Looking to read something off the beaten path completely different? Max Brooks science-fiction novel presents itself as a chronicle of the battle for humanity between humans and their undead foes. Writing in the guise of firsthand accounts of survivors and veterans of the war, Brooks tracks his story from the first Zombie rising in China, through the harrowing ""Battle of Yonkers"" and then finally to humanity's last stand to recapture their world from the lurching, moaning undead. Some ripe political satire and a few obligatory gross-out scenes keeps the pace moving briskly, as Brooks cloaks his prose as true fact, at times emulating non-fiction books like The Greatest Generation."" At times this one-trick-pony does go off the rails a little bit, but the author should be congratulated for taking a novel concept and making it work. If you like ""outsider"" fiction, this is for you."
2,Boring,At first I thought the book was interesting. Then it turned to boring and towards the end I was just waiting for it to end. This book would be much better if the author changed it from the characters telling their stories in past tense to present tense. It would be much more interesting and scary. I didn't find the book funny or scary. I'm not really sure what kind of book it was trying to be.
5,An enjoyable departure from the norm,"This book reads like a documentary with short vignettes that tell the tale of ruination and hope that are the main staple of zombie survival novels. It wasn't about gore, but similar to popular Walking Dead show on AMC, this focused more on the human element of a worldwide zombie takeover. Kudos to the author for coming up with something fresh!"
1,"Bad book, Amazon reviewers nailed it","The author is terrible. I do agree with someone else, once I read about how artillery wouldn't hurt the zombies, I wanted to quit reading. The interview style is terrible after a while. Everyone interviewed speaks the same way as everyone else, and it's laughably pathetic. This guy basically is regurgitating his high school education in this book, instead of telling a story. It just doesn't work, and I gave up. Max Brooks needs to go back to writing school."
1,VERY BAD READ..INFACT ONE OF THE WORST EVER,"DONT WASTE YOUR TIME, THERE ARE OTHER ZOMBIE READS OUT THERE, THIS WAS CHILDISH, AND NO ONE SHOULD EVER HAVE TO WASTE THEIR HARD EARNED MONEY AND TIME WITH THIS NON SENSE"
1,A Tedious Read,"I found this book to be a very tedious read. (So much so, that I read two other books, in-between)While The Zombie Survival Guide was a funny read, this book was completely opposite. It had its moments, such as what was happening, down in a submarine and up in a space station, however they were few and far between.This may be one of the exceptions where the movie turns out better than the book. . .myspace.com/horror_reviews"
2,mediocre at best,"i got the zombie survival guide and found it to be extremely interesting. so i got world war z for my birthday. needless to say i was disapointed. the book itself barely even touches on the fact that the zombies attacked. the entire begining is about illegal immigrants coming out of china. WHO CARES!!! i wanted to read about people getting eaten and killing zombies, not the business aspects if the asian government. overall not a good read."
2,World War Z,"This book was not at all what I expected. It is not about a War, as the title indicates. It ""jumps"" from one scenario to another every few pages. It is very hard to follow the story line.. The Earth is supposedly being overrun by the Un-dead, yet, people appear to be living normal lives and paying little attention to the possible end of life as they know it. It is just a lot of words."
1,Fun but stupid,"It was fun, in a mindless sort of way, but deeply defined by mid-20th century pop-history and lacking in any characters that were fully realized or sympathetic.I enjoyed it because I was ready for a break from thinking. But it was, and remains, utter trash."
1,Warning: This Book May TURN You in to a Zombie!!,"I don't want to read anything like this ever again. The story was interesting, I mean, who doesn't want to hear about zombies. But the fact that the reader has to sift thru loads of information makes this book difficult and ultimately boring. A coworker recommend this to me...FAIL! I'll read for what feels like an hour, only to find I've been reading for fifteen minutes.I wanted nothing more to get to the end of this book.I'm sorry I paid full price for it. I recommend finding another more interesting/entertaining zombie book to read."
5,Great read for the Zombie fan.,"A smart and very entertaining book. Its got everything a zombie fanatic would want from a book about a war against zombies. Guns, equipment, strategies, stories, everything presented in an interesting interview format that gives it a legitiment documented feel. If you are dissapointed with all the lame recent zombie action flicks like Resident Evil and Land of the Dead, then World War Z will be a breathe of fresh air-- a piece of zombie work thats done just right. 5 out of 5 because it sets out to do exactly what satisifes a zombie fan."
5,"Great book, highly reccomended",This is an excellent book. It details the rise of a zombie epidemic that sweeps the globe and kills millions.There are a few logical inconsistancies but otherwise it is a great book. I highly reccommend it.
1,Swing and a miss,"I got this book for Christmas and previously had no experience with zombie literature. If this book is considered ""very good"" by zombie afficiandos, as it would appear from the majority of the reviews, this is certianly a genre I should avoid. I found the writing to be boring, the delivery choppy and the theme far too preachy. Moreover, the book was filled with inconsistencies. At Yonkers, the zombies are aggresive and over run the military. Later, they are so lethargic that one just whacks them with a shovel to kill them. As always, I read it to the end to see if it got better. In retospect, I wished I had stopped half way through and started a good book. Don't waste your time on this one."
2,Boring.,"I found the book to be boring, with long interludes between occasionally gripping narrative passages. The interviews do suffer from a similar voicing, with sentence structure unceasingly uniform throughout. You're not likely to encounter such blandness were you to interview the neighbors on your street, never mind if you were to interview people from around the world(as the narrator claims to have done).And then there are the requirements that you believe that zombies(human flesh here) don't dry out. Why doesn't the flesh become dessicated and dehydrated? Was every deceased plastinated? I'd have much preferred if Brooks added some component of decay to the zombie experience, barring that he should have explained how his creation denies physical law.Yes, I understand that the precept of a zombie novel denies physical law, but saying that human flesh doesn't dry out(and the zombies aren't carrying water bottles) but can freeze seems an unnecessary trespass on the readers goodwill."
1,Dull and poorly written.,"The book reads like a bad comic book. I couldn't make it through the fourth narrative. I had to give up. The characters are undeveloped, the dialog is childish and the story is dull. I think I would have possibly liked this book when I was 11 or 12. Unfortunately I attempted to read it as an adult."
4,Fun read,"Fun read. Nice twist on the genre .... Humans having prevailed. I am looking forward to the movie, though I am not sure how well the book will translate to the big screen."
3,"Good, but more of a past tense read","I enjoyed the little stories that went with this read, i just look for a more story than a past tense and review of what has happen. recommend if you want a good intro into zombie apocolypse type books"
1,Paperback is cheaper than the Kindle version,The paperback version of this book on Amazon is $8.27 currently. Kindle rip-off versions of books get one star from me.
3,A so-so zombie novel,"The approach is definitely unique, which is why I gave it three stars. I personally did not like that the book described the zombie war in a generalized recalling of events. I prefer my zombie action to be much more ""in your face"" - the feeling of being right there with the characters with a well-written zombie tale was woefully missing from this one. I'm also pretty disappointed the publisher makes you pay so much to find this out. I won't be recommending this one to friends."
5,Great,Great book great condition great deal in price zombie apocalypse here I come I can not wait for the movie to come out
2,Disappointed,"I'm fascinated with the idea of Zombie's and usually enjoy Zombie apocolypse fiction but I really couldn't get into this book a all. It was long winded with alot of jargon that I found really hard to follow. There were a couple of good accounts but they were few and far between. Too many real life references that the average person doesn't know about, I found I had to keep flipping to the reference list to get through every second sentence."
4,Very good Zombie Apocalypse book,"The book stars off immediately with an account of one of the survivors and takes off from there. The thought and details that goes into every page is astounding. He must have spent alot of time imagining the world and how it would be because its very imaginitive and cleverly set up. The things I didn't like were some of the characters, some acted very absurd. Since the book is written in an interview perspective, it does not allow you to be with the characters from beginning to end and you don't feel as invested. The this book is still very well written thanks to Max Brooks and Its a very suspenseful account of what could happen during a zombie apocalypse, Its very good overall and I recommend World War Z."
2,Overrated,Not as interesting as people made it. Just a whole bunch of interviews and short stories. No main character to follow or climactic points.
5,Before the movie...,"As a bonafide zombie fan, I'm always on the lookout for stories about the un-dead, whether they're in print or on the big screen. After recently seeing a commercial for the upcoming movie of the same title- a family member suggested the book & highly recommended it. I was not disappointed. Each chapter describes, in detail, each country's approach to the zombie apocalypse & contains individual accounts of the horrors they witnessed & how they survived the terrible times.. Lots of details, lots of really creepy imagery... I couldn't put it down."
3,Better as movie?,"The back and forth, one character to another writing kept me confused. Even when I noticed the character's names were overlapping in places I had already forgotten what the had previously said. I will see the movie however and see if having faces to watch will help with that part of it for me."
3,O.K....Could have been a lot better.,"I am a huge Zombie movie/book/game fan. Even my friends can attest, I have made them sit through many films and stories. I say all this first so you can understand that I am not just a casual fan of the genre.I bought ""World war Z"" with high expectations, based on the reviews I was hearing, but it didn't deliver what I expected. It is indeed a well written book, with bits of action here and there, but it lacks the one thing that makes zombie books/movies/games great, character development. The book is short stories of survivors, so you really never get a chance to fall in love with some, hate some, and just get downright amused with some!Where the book is good lies in the detailed accounts of how certain governments would deal with a zombie breakout. So I gave it 3 stars, mainly for effort.Brody"
3,Author's bias's keep getting in the way....,"The book and many of it's concepts are good, but the author's political views keep seeping getting in the way... esp since many of them have been proven wrong since the book was published.And the author's view of the military. He chip shoots the Iraq War and makes general's look like bumbling idiots, then he give props to a citizen's army and Marine Corps.Is this just to sell books?Also his ignorance of the true effect of artillery or airstrikes in favor of using a shovel to kill zombies was a bit much to ignore, as well as bullet performance.All in all an interesting book that did have some great stuff, but the author should humble himself and do some real research."

2,ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZombies made dull,"THIS BOOK IS BORING! Like the zombies I so enjoy, I am just looking for a blood drenched, brain splattering, limp severing, entrails flying, no thought required good time!"
5,Zombie fans fantasy come true,"When George A. Romero made the film Day of the dead, that was his attempt at answering all those little questions you had about zombies, this book is filled with all of those answers and more inventive scenarios than you could have wished for. Great book, if they ever make this into a movie, ill be the guy waiting for 3 weeks outside the theater just to see it. Buy this immediately, wether it be on amazon, ebay, or whatever."
3,"Fun Read, A Bit Too Long","I enjoyed this book. However, as I went through the story, the more I was ""checking my watch"" (to steal a phrase from movies). If it had been about 25% shorter, and focused on either the human story or military story, it would have been a 4 or 5 star book. Brooks' vision of the world handling an infestation of reanimated corpses taps into a discussion of humanity, politics, morals, and religion. A very fun ""What if?"" for any of the What-if Fans out there. A worthwhile read, and the kind of book that some will like more than others."
4,Very entertaining,"Not the greatest book I have ever read, but definately an intelligent read.I would recommend it and look forward to the upcoming movie interpretation of the book."
5,"Exceeded expectaions, great book for the Zombie World War","I loved this book, a lot of it was based on real facts.(except the zombies of course)The book is basically a collection of made up interviews that together tells the plot of the outbreak of a world war where the enemy is zombies, a fearless enemy who's ranks swell as humanity's numbers dwindle. It goes so far as to push humanity on the brink of extinction.It is a dark book, and told in a really realistic way too, and the ending was really done well, not just a jip off typical zombie ending.I much rather prefer this book then Stephen King's Cell, a book about zombies too. (although I also enjoyed that book too, because I am fascinated with the idea of zombies)Apparently both books are becoming movies.I defnitely recommend this book for a good read, and don't be surprised if you learn something deeper within it's texts about human nature and the world in general and am at the same time wildly entertained throughout the process."
3,"Fun ideas, but the concept is not fully realized","As you should know by now the concept of the book is that the author conducts interviews with the survivors of the zombie war; politicians, soldiers and regular people. But this concept just isn't executed as well as it could be. Though each interviewee tells a fascinating story that illuminates an aspect of the global struggle that is truly original, Brooks does very little to make them really feel like interviews. Each subject speaks in flourishing prose and spins a tail right on the spot better than anyone I've ever met. They are completely candid and require no prodding from the interviewer and apparently speak perfect English (thought the interviews take place all over the world). Again the ideas are unique and the book is worth reading, it's a fun new take on the genre. But if you are easily taken out of a story when things don't add up, skip it."
3,Interesting concept,"First - do not expect a central cast of characters or detailed plot - the author is up front about this (though it takes some time to figure that out when you are reading the book) when he calls it an 'oral history.' Essentially, and the other reviewers have already said this, the book is a string of interviews from various parts of the world, all covering 'World War Z.' I made it through, but was disappointed that a central character to relate to was never really brought into play.Still, the preview for the upcoming movie looks quite interesting."
4,fine world catastrophy guidebook,"even if you replace zombies with, say; ghowls, warewolves, mummies, or similar freaks, the book will stand just as well, because it takes the problem from an strategic point of view... just miss a cientific plausible explanation of how the hell a dead can rise... they just say they do..."
4,Pretty good,"This book was super easy to read and interesting enough to read pretty quickly. Its style, however, doesn't really lead to any character development or attachment. Although I guess thats the point."
4,Was a bit skeptical about the format of the novel...,"But I have to say that Max Brooks did a fantastic job turning page after page of ""interviews"" into something that flowed just like a ""regular"" novel. Well written, fun, occasionally funny and definitely dark subject matter. Check it out!"
5,This book is awesome!,I am a HUGE fan of this genre and this is one of my all time favorites! It hits the nail on the head and is exactly what zombie apocolypse fans want!Buy it!
4,Even if you are not a Zombie fan... get this book.,"World War Z is unlike most books I have read, due to the oral history accounting of the events that happen throughout the book. It is like reading several interviews about what happened during the fictitious Zombie War and more importantly, how it effected individual people and communities all over the world. The individual stories that are told have a genuine emotional quality that is all too relevant in these tough global times. Even though it is a collection of individual stories from different points of view, Max Brooks does a wonderful job of tethering these to a broader sense of a main story arc. Once I was finished with the last chapter, I had a clear idea of the big picture. Very rewarding. I immediately passes it along to a friend!"
4,Fun read,Enjoyed this book very much. We'll see how the movie does. Once you start you won't want to put it down
4,Good book,"Gave it four stars. It reads more like a collection of short stories. I liked the ""big picture"" aspect of the zombie apocalypse."
5,World War Z leaves its mark.,"This book was great. I found great enjoyment in the way the author went into great detail to show the reader how people from different cultures, different ideologies, and different walks of life dealt with the zombie plague. He also went into painstaking detail of countries with different topographies that either were a great help in defending against the hordes of the undead or were the reason for their doom! I recommend this book to anyone who likes horror books. This novel was a very quick read, and the author Max Brooks really delivers a fantastic tale!"
2,It's a Documentary,"Zombie novels are entertaining and if well written can be a kind of historical novel when one suspends belief. There are many out there, but WWZ is not, in my opinion, one of them. It is disjointed and incohesive and too long. There are many interesting passages but none successfully relates to any other. There is no character development, not even in the narrator. It is difficult to empathize with any character. If this were a novel about an actual historical war, it would be interesting to read of the happenings individualized around the world. But the repetitious nature of WWZ is not as interesting."
2,How Can a Zombie Apocalypse Be So Boring?,"Very disappointed. If you've never seen a zombie movie before, maybe this book would be fun. Otherwise, it is an enormous bore. How is this possible?! The concept gets an ""A."" But the execution gets a ""D."" Every interview sounds like the last one. There is almost no variance in the characters' voices. The unending chapter about the FDR-New Deal-governmental reorganization going on in the Western US was miserable. That's when I quit. I can't believe Mel Brooks's son managed to make such a hash of such a good idea. At the time of this review, the book has close to 900 reviews and a 4.5 star rating: HOW? Ugh. Amazon reviewers, you done me wrong."
2,I guess I just don't get it,"I bought this book because I like zombies. I like thrillers and thought it would be a good book-especially with hearing so many positive reviews. 4 1/2 stars from 900 some people-it must be good! I keep putting it down and just not picking it back up though. It just isn't holding my interest at all. I have had the book about a month and still haven't finished it.The book takes place after the zombies have taken over the world and were supposedly defeated by humans. The world is very different now. There are a series of short 'interviews' by those who lived through it all and have a story to tell. The stories by themselves are ok and entertaining, interesting. But you have to start over every story from the beginning-set up the story, scene, characters, etc. It's very hard to have to do this over and over and over and over again."
2,Not even a collection of short stories.,"The one shot characters and stories were very boring for me. No back story for the vast majority, no real character development, not much of anything.If you are big into zombie fiction,read it, you probably won't be disappointed but I'm sure you won't be wowed. If not, save yourself some time and money and just pick a different book."
5,Best zombie book ever,This book is so well written and planned that I nearly believed a zombie war actually happened. He took the old zombie genre and made it real.
5,Excellent read!,This book was very entertaining and enjoyable to read. The vivid descriptions and accounts given by each of the characters in the book along with the ideas and feasibility of the scenario itself make for a very captivating read. Two thumbs up!!
4,Good Story!,"I have to admit that the story keeped me reading. Usually I have at least 2 things going at a time, but I read this straight through."
1,Boring,"I was bored quickly with this book and kept hoping for the end. I would get into an interesting interview, start visualizing what was happening and it would suddenly end and to go into a long boring interview. Certain parts of the book made me think of the film The Day After Tomorrow with zombies instead of the environment. Just a disappointing read."
2,Disappointed,"I must admit that the high ratings of this book now make me hesitate to try the other highly-rated zombie books here on Amazon. First, I am a huge zombie genre fan (I love the 28 Days Later movies), and I was excited to read this book. It started off fairly promisingly, but it seems the author ran out of ideas about half way through, and every survivor's story turned into a miniature morality play where greed, pollution, or hubris was the cause of the people being eaten by zombies. It got repetitive and boring, and I had to force myself to finish it. I'm going to have to take ""zombie ratings"" with a larger grain of salt, methinks. Try ""I Am Legend"" for a better zombie read."
4,Interesting Political Commentary,World War Z delves into the ineptitude of a Government so tied up in its own tangle of bureaucracy that it is incapable of responding to a threat quickly spiraling out of control
1,Oral history format was teadious at best.,In my opinion the format allowed the author to avoid developing complex characters and a real plot. I am sure some folks like it but it was too disjointed for me. More fit for a short story than a novel.
5,An Incredible Book,"An incredible, amazing, fascinating book, truly superb. I couldn't put it down. Very realistic and quite serious in tone. Like the best science fiction, it takes a fantastic premise, then presents a perfectly logical follow-up. You'll be surprised at how real zombies can seem."
1,Freakin' Pointless!,"I don't understand all the hype and 4/5 star ratings. This is the most horrible zombie book I've ever read, and I've read a LOT of them! I was expecting a lot more because of all the talk about this book, and boy was I disappointed.This is not really a coherent book at all. This is a disjointed, pointless mess of personal anecdotes from around the globe without any central characters or plot. For as long as it is you would think there would be more detail about the spread, conquest etc of the zombie plague, but this too is lacking. I don't see how this can be a movie unless they're going to just write an entirely new script as is commonplace nowadays. This is one case where the horrible movie might actually be BETTER than the horrible book.I was similarly disappointed with Brooks' Survival Guide which I read first, although that at least had some interesting information and amusing thoughts."
5,Excellent Book,"This is the first review of a book I have written. I tend to be some harsh in my reviews of horror and zombie books, and at first glance I didn't think I would be that impressed with this book but I have to admit this was probably the best zombie book I have read. Sure still some flaws in the logic; zombies aren't likely to over power a modern army with thousands of rounds of ammo and high explosives but that doesn't really detract from the fun of the book. Have to admit couldn't put this book down, read it in only a few days which is unusual for me nowadays. The only zombie book I've given 5 stars too."
5,What Needs to Be Said?,"This is an amazing book. If you are a fan of zombies at all, this is part 2 of what many consider the Bible of Zombie (The Zombie Survival Guide being the other half).There are not words in my vocabulary to describe the awesomeness of this book. The intricately woven stories make you go back and re-read previous portions to stay on top of everything. The way everything goes together so well is just pure genius. And the fact that this is 100% genuine material, not some ha ha funny joke kind of thing.God, it's so good. Go read the Zombie Survival Guide as well."
1,"Seriously, what is so great about this book?","I cannot for the life of me, understand why this book has gotten such great reviews. It's not a great book. I'm an avid reader of all things zombie so I read it a couple years ago. I was so disappointed. And just recently I saw the author on a show called Zombies vs Vampires. He was such a freaking tool, douce bag. He took himself way to seriously as if he was actually an expert on zombies when all he did was jump on the band wagon and copy all the other zombie writers out there. Do yourself a favor and skip this one. You won't be missing anything."
1,What's all the fuss?,"Given the book's popularity I was expecting something really exciting and engaging. I quickly grew tired of the interviews that always stopped just at the point when they could have gotten interesting. Perhaps if I'd gone into it with lower expectations...But then again, I think Zone One by Colson Whitehead is spectacular, and it's overall rank on amazon is 3 stars, so I guess I'm at odds with the current here."
1,Not worth the money,I was very disappointed in this book. I am apart of a book club and this book we all voted for to read for the month. The whole book club could not get into it and all had dropped reading it. Once we started talking about how the book is coming along all had stated they could not get into it at all..and did not want to read it.I do know that there probably are some people who do like this type of book and that is fine. Just know that this book is not for everyone. And not everything is as it seems when it comes to what they say this book is about vrs reading it.
5,Number 1,"Without a doubt, the number 1 zombie book out. Period. If you like zombie books, you'll love this one."
5,Not your average zombie book,I love all things zombie and Mr. Brooks has created something unlike any zombie book I have ever read. To have put it in interview form from many different survivors is brilliant. Many of the different government response scenarios are so plausible and probable we all should be fearful in the case of an actually world catastrophe.
3,Written as a series of short stories told as interviews,wasn't bad most of the stories were interesting with some dry spots in-between. good book in my opinion. however was different than i expected
4,Pretty okay,The perspective felt unique and the story held my attention but I never felt on edge like one would expect a zombie book would make you feel. I enjoyed it anyway.
3,A good read...,Very well thought-out and researched. Most of the tales were interesting with the exception of a few that were almost intolerably boring; but those with riveting stories probably were not... around... to share them?! And the tale about dachshunds being used for zombie recon brought a smile to my face!
2,Kind of dull compared to watching the walking dead.,Too repetitive and didn't care if I finished it or not. It reall wasn't a story and jumped around the globe to to many people for interviews. Only a few parts had any real tension.
3,"Good zombie novel, disconnect flow...","I enjoyed the novel, but it's format (interviews with survivors) did not allow to really connect with the characters and the events they were facing!Nevertheless there were quite a few memorable characters. I really liked the Japanese blind master!"
5,Humanity,"By setting the novel in a world war against zombies, Max Brooks writes from the perspective of characters from around the world. His short vignettes provide powerful testimony to what is common to all humans: hope, courage, ingenuity, fear, perseverance. This is a book for everyone - it's not about zombies, it's about us."
4,"Great audiobook,but read the book before or after!","This is a great audiobook, the cast is really top notch and their interpretations give life to the story. However, this is an abridged version and you should get the full version of the book, to get the whole picture.World War Z is a great book. The main character is the human spirit, the will to overcome the most terrible odds, the desire to survive no matter what. There are great ideas in zombie combat in the book and it also takes into account the complex social relations of such a situation."
3,world war z,"my first max brooks book..was looking on something more descriptive of the horror side of a zombie war..this is more about logistics,procedural,and governmental responsibilities(or lack thereof)..was hoping for something more personal,and descriptive...maybe i should have started with his first zombie book instead..."
3,A collection of short stories...,"Too much breadth, too little depth. I don't believe any story in the book exceeds 5 pages. At least 10% of the pages must be devoted to the endless stream of new characters that must be introduced for each short episode. Only a handful of characters (maybe 5?) have a followup story at the end of the book.If he had created 2-4 primary characters, and followed their trip thru the war, it would probably have been a much more riveting novel. Instead, it's an endless stream of ""soundbite"" stories. All sizzle, no steak."
4,Not the whole book,"This is a great production. The voice acting is solid enough and keeps you in the story. I was really and truley pleased with the production untill I realized that it was missing about half the book. They clearly picked the most stories that coverd the most ground - but calling this ""unabridged"" is in no was accurate. The stories that were told were, for the most part, left alone but so much of what was cut was refered to in what was left in - I like those stories: the decimations in russia, the K-9 retirment home, the houses on stilts, the reporter on the aircraft carrier at the political summet. So much of the fine detail is missing. I gave it 4 stars because they did not finish their work. what they did was great, but where is the rest."
2,Snoozer,"I enjoy a good ""scary"" zombie book and this fell flat. Regardless of which character was regurgitating their ""thoughts"" on what happened, the stories were all the same - dull and told in the same flat format. This book was poorly written, boring and difficult to finish."
2,Not as good as I'd hoped,The book was very well thought out but with the style of writing I never really felt like I was getting into each storyline.
3,Yawn,Was hoping for more action. This book didn't have me on the edge of my seat awaiting the turn of the page. I just longed for it to end.
4,Interesting and WOW,"Such a great read. This book is written as a documentary after-the-fact: the world zombie war is over and he is talking to survivors. Such detail-- like he wrote all of these survivors' stories first and then wrote their journals and then took excerpts from those. Amazing, interesting, innovative and incredibly detailed. I don't know how the movie will be, but I'll hope for the best!"
3,Not my cup o tea,If you are more into character development and less into a documentary then this book is not for you. It was an OK read I suppose.
5,A must read for all zombie fans!,"Excellent read. I really enjoyed the ""oral history"" approach the author takes in telling this zombie story. A unique perspective."
4,Zombie War,If you like zombie books you should really like this one. Told from points of views from all over the world Brooks paints a bleak and dismal picture of the dead attacking the living and the horrors of learning how to battle the onslaught of millions of zombies. This was an engrossing tale and a triumph of the human spirit. I really can't wait to see the movie!
4,What a great way to tell a story!!!!!!,What a great way to tell a story!! I defiantly recommend this book.... I received it in audio format and listen to it in the car on the way to work..... Many times I drove around the block so I could keep listening. Great story!!!!! When is the next one????
3,Fun,Didn't and still haven't got into the zombie craze. This book takes a look at the human element of something so wild as reanimated corpses. I liked it.
4,Very good zombie read!,"Excellent book. Did not give it 5 stars as I would have enjoyed a little more character development through the different stages of the outbreak. Toward the end, it dragged a bit and this would not have been this issue had he developed the characters a bit more for the reader."
3,3 stars,"While this is a very well written book, it is difficut to stay interested in it. Every chapter is a short story with all new characters and in no way connected with any other story. Some of the stories are better than others but any could be left out and it wouldn't effect the book at all. The book should be listed as a collection of short stories."
4,fun reread,"I borrowed World War Z from a friend and couldn't put it down. I gave it back two days later... but at first I had pooh-poohed as trashy pulp. Every where I looked it seemed like another zombie book was in the book store window. As I read it though, I found myself not only enjoying the interview narrative but the attention to detail. Brooks mentions a few places I've visited personally and I found his research to be pretty good. Further, his hints at catastrophes that he doesn't get into in the story itself kept me reading, hoping to find out more as to what happened in Buenos Aires or China Camp for example.I picked it up again three days, at a loss for a fast fun good read, and found myself just as eager to finish it all in one sitting as I when I read it the first time. I'm not a zombie or an apocalypse fanboy... I am a fan though of decent writing, compelling narratives, and stories of how humans seem to be at the center of most system failures. World War Z is all of the above."
3,"Let me write a paragraph about this character and, whoops, time for another","World War Z has a very interesting concept. A UN official is recording oral history from the recently finished war with the undead. Well, the war that's wrapping up with the undead. Some of the characters get better dialogue than others, some get better characterization than others, but on the whole it's pretty good. I guess the one thing I didn't really care for is that it seems like each character gets a page or two to himself, then it's off to someone else. It's an interesting technique to show a broad slice of an ongoing multinational event, but it leaves you wondering if any of the character aside from the UN narrator have done much developing, and it's harder to find closure.Obviously this may sound like sour grapes on my part, but I don't think Max Brooks minds at all."
5,Excellent Choice!!!,"Amazon has once again outdid the competition by not only giving the best value, but quick and easy service. I would recommend the book for anyone who loves zombies. The stories are captivating and extremely interesting."
3,Okay if like zombie lit,"Which, as it turns out after reading about two-thirds of the book, I guess I don't. Zombies don't offer much as villians go- they moan, they shuffle along, and that's about it. Brooks does offer up some clever asides, as when he notes that most of us today in the computer age would have no useful skills to offer in the aftermath of a national catastrophe. I'd recommend this book only for serious zombie lovers."
4,"Very realistic, extremely entertaining","This book was awesome. I wasn't exactly sure what to expect in the beginning, but after getting into it a bit, I couldn't put it down. It describes an alternate history that at times seems so real, it scares you. Every different account that you read through, makes you want to hear the entire life story of that person. All in all, a very different but extremely good read. I highly recommend it."
5,Zombie fans rejoice!,It's great to find a well-written and highly imaginative novel in the zombie genre that does NOT pander to the young male demographic...ie: it's not all about the gore.
3,Hope the movie does the book justice.,A lot of excellent short stories. Some NOT so excellent. No real ending to speak of. Alice in headland is better
2,"Started well, but fell flat fast","Problem...if you don't connect to any of the characters of a book, what's the point? It was so interesting in the beginning, but then the amount of profanity and the fact that I couldn't connect to any of the characters made me put it down half-way through. Bummer. Not a good use of money."
4,I never thought of that.,"My experience with zombies had been limited to Dawn Of The Dead, Resident Evil and, of course, The Walking Dead. So, I never really thought about the global epidemic that goes along with the dead coming back to life.Mr. Brooks has approached the zombie apocalypse from a new and fascinating angle; The global response. The ""war"" covers the entire globe and is fought with everything from tanks to spears.Overall, I really enjoyed this book. Everything from the characters to the technology was realistic and plausible. Now to prepare for the war by reading the Zombie Survival Guide."
3,book,"This book i bought cause I saw that it was made into a movie that is not out yet , so i figured i would read it before the movie but it is kinda boring and has not really caught my attention, too many different stories."
5,Best book I've read in a decade,"Don't eschew this book because you think it's just another zombie book. It's not. It's literally an oral history of the zombie war, written by and for the survivors of that war. Brilliantly conceived and executed, it was almost impossible to put down. His world building is amazing and so real that its difficult to distinguish from our reality."
2,Eh,"Pretty disappointed with this. I thought it would be more than a series of short stories.. more in depth characters.. better connected stories.. or at least have a main character through out the whole thing. So far, I'm having a hard time reading through it because it's just several descriptions of what was happening. Some are not even an entire story."
2,Didn't like.,A 22 year old coworker recommended this book. He raved about it. This is definitely a book that would appeal to a 22 year old.
3,"Imaginative, but flawed in its execution...","I was very hopeful when I cracked this book open, but was ultimately disappointed by the lack of stylistic variation, which is crucial since the author is recounting stories from many different survivors of the Zombie War. Not only that, but there are several plot holes that are distractingly blatant. These, in addition to several typos (how does a book go through as many printings as WWZ and not have them corrected?) broke the ""suspension of disbelief"" that would be necessary to really become immersed in a book like this.With these drawbacks, I still give World War Z three stars for being an imaginative new take on the zombie genre. But if you're really interested in a gripping, horrifying and engrossing zombie survival tale, pick up Robert Kirkman's ""The Walking Dead"" from Image Comics."
4,Nice.,"Every time I sit down to read this book, I am left with chills.Max Brooks created the many different characters for each of the interviews of the oral history of the zombie war.I really like owning this book as I have also purchased a copy of the Zombie Survival Guide, also an enjoyable book to read.I can recommend this book to anyone that likes horror and fictional historic reference!Five stars!"
5,WORLD WAR Z,Great book for any zombie genre fan...realistic and horrific approach to a overexposed subject
1,soooo not good,"I've read at least 40 zombie novels. This is the only one that put me to sleep. I dont understand why it has so many positive reviews. I tried to read this book several times, but finally gave up.So in my opinion borrow this book, dont waste your money. If you want a good read, try Day By Day Armageddon Origin To Exile, Zombie Fallout series, Joe McKinney's four book series, Z.A. Recht's series, heck just about any other zombie book ive read was better than this book."
5,World War Z? Good or Bad?,"I enjoyed this book more than the Zombie Survival Guide, although I am a fan of both. This is about a bureaucrat collecting stories of the survivors of a massive zombie outbreak. I recommend it for any zombie fan of any level. It also is a pretty easy read."
2,I expected more,"Not sure what I was expecting but this wasn't it. I knew from the description it was accounts from people the author meets and their stories of the Zombie war. However, I found myself getting bored and not able to focus on what I was reading. Some of it was entertaining but for the most part I was waiting to get to the end.I love Zombie stories and I expected great things from this book. I was working at Barnes and Noble when it came out and I saw the popularity and how quickly it hit the best seller list. I was unfortunately disappointed and wished it was better. I tried the audio version of this because there were some big actors who were reading the different parts. That still couldn't help this book be interesting to me. It is still very popular and a lot of people like it, I just hoped for more action and less chit chat."
4,Good read,"Great job adding a creative spin and building on itself to create a full picture of the ""zombie war""- makes it stand out from the typical zombie story- recommend"
4,Excellent story telling,"I enjoyed this book thoroughly. My only complaint was the battle of Yonkers. Other than that, this was a great read."
4,World War Z,"Great book, loved every moment. One of the best zombie books I've read. This is what a true zombie apocalypse would be like."
3,OK book,Came highly recommended. Movie looks like it will be better than the book (sad). Just did not hold my interest.
4,A original look,"Chose this book for an original view of a long lived tradition. I was not disappointed. We get to see the battle for the survival of mankind from the shoulder`s point of view as well as he family man protecting his lost home to the invaders, down to the lost soldier behind enemy lines. All told with original points of view and original voices. Zombie book or no this is a good political book for our current climate."
2,"less fun, more filling","i whole heartedly agree with daniel b. below. nowhere near as fun as the zombie survival guide, which i loved. too much left wing politics, not enough zombies.on the other hand, you have to expect some explanation/point of view from the author as to why he's writing zombie fiction in the first place, and max gives you that, like it or not. at least he took his stand.i don't care about this book, but i hope they make the 'survival guide' into a movie somehow. maybe a 'crocodile hunter' docudrama type treatment. it was hilarious."
1,All the rage? Not so much.,"Alright. So there was a lot of hub bub hoopla about this novel. Firstly, its a fantastic idea. Fictional recounting of experiences during the Zombie War taken down by someone hired/appointed by a global council of sorts. The book begins out well, the accounts of survivors and the roles and experiences they have. But...then I noticed I wasn't enjoying the quality of the writing. It wasn't very inspired or vivid. Sure, I could picture what was happening, but a lot of it came from my own imagination. No beautiful phrases, unsettling images, etc. And on top of this it becomes so repetative. Somebody struggling with surviving the war, over and over and over.I gave it one star because I just was not interested at all in finishing this book and moved on."
4,A good piece of classic horror... with a twist,"All we love zombies. I mean, crushing zombies. And we gotta be prepared for the wars to came between zombies and humans! So, go ahead and read this book. You'll find it funny and scary. Considering it all, is not a bad novel, but don't expect high literature, but a lot of fun stuff."
1,Good concept but didn't pull it off,"I was really disappointed with this book. I found the book's concept to be very interesting. For me the book bombed, I labored to get through each little episode. His political or cultural allusions seemed to be more on the petty side and detracted from the story. I was expecting a better quality of story telling."
2,The book is great; the audiobook is dismal,"[the two stars here are for the audiobook only. I give the book six stars.I loved the book. Best book I've read in years. Couldn't put it down.But the audiobook is dismal. The voice artists are amateurish, their speech clumsy and unnatural. It's as though they're reading from a script that they haven't rehearsed and they don't know how to get ""in character"". The attempts at foreign accents are overdone and painful to listen to.(I love listening to audiobooks and radioplays. I listen to many hours of BBC World Service every day. I know what foreign accents sound like. Not like these).I strongly recommend that you find a preview of this audiobook before buying it, to see if you'll dislike it as much as I do. Or buy the book instead. Heck, buy five copies of the book like I did and give them to your friends. Awesome book."
1,Sucked,"Nothing but political correct bull$***disguised as zombie fiction. I cannot express how old these kind of things have gotten. All the bad asses are women, the smart ideas are from jews or negros... No reason why a White man should read this book unless he likes getting dumped on"
3,Not what I expected,"I read this book due to a recommendation of a friend and the continued hype around the book. I must say, I was rather disappointed with the book. The books pacing is slow to me and kind of dragged out. I suppose that if you really, really like post-apocalyptic stories you might want to read this but if you like faster paced books you'll get board with it.I also found that the style of the story writing negatively broke up the story which really interfered with the continuity."
2,Not much to offer.,"This book is alright not many stories stick out of my mind. The details are nice it's just to forgettable. I don't remember most of the book and when you think about it, that doesn't make a good book. If a friend has it borrow it but don't buy it. Get this instead:The Zombie Survival Guide: Complete Protection from the Living Deadfrom same author but better"
3,Meh,"Reading his zombie survival guide was great the deadpan approach was hilarious. That book was fun until the recorded attacks in history, which were all the same. In World War Z, the stories all seemed to really blend. One thing I really did not enjoy is the amount of people interviewed in the book. Some passages honestly felt like filler and gave nothing pertinent to the story. I wish he chose 4-6 characters and the whole book book was their interviews. At times he leaves you hanging and if he returns to the character, you dont even realize it because of all the abrupt character changes. Awesome concept, poorly written."
3,WW Z Could it happen?,Very good story about mankind fighting back from the Brink of Extinction!!Could it really happen this way?? Maybe not with Zombies but very possibly with any other situation that destroys the fabric of civilization look at what happened in New Orlr\eans after Katrina it was dog eat dog down the survival of the fittest and the tru human nature and will to survive that is in all of us!!! Are you prepared????
5,100% Gold,"I love zombie novels. Well, everything zombie. This is a must read to all zombie fanatics. While I read the low star reviews of this novel I understand the complaint was the style it is written in...the interview/short story setup. This book is beautifully captured in this style. It makes it all the better. This is my absolute favorite book to date."
5,Sets the stage for Zombie novels.,"Not sure this would transfer over to a movie at all, but accomplishes what it wants to for sure. The ideas that Max Brooks comes up with are phenomenal. I have been considering writing a Zombie book, and every few pages of World War Z I think to myself, man, what didn't I think of that. If you can enjoy a zombie movie, you will enjoy this book. It is almost the perfect book for fanatics."
3,ok expected more,not a bad book overall but felt the plot line dragged out a little more but then again im more of a brian keene type of zombie reader than this. will wait and see what the movie does although i heard the zombies will all be CGI a bold risk. did the studios not learn from I Am Legend????
1,Life is too short to read a book this bad,"With all the hype I expected a good Zombie book. What I got was political propaganda. A can't speak for the whole book, because I quit after 25%, but the characters seemed to fall into two categories: Those who tried to do something and were apologetic, and those who didn't do anything but try to save themselves and they were angry with those who tried to do something. If you are very far left leaning you will probably enjoy the views of military personnel and business people. If you are a normal person you will be disappointed. Spend your time well...elsewhere."
1,Not what I thought...,I thought it would had more of a story line. It was hard to follow along. I usually tend to finish a book within the week but this took me longer.
3,Ok. Unique writing style,"This book doesn't follow the normal novel writing style. By that, I mean its not really a story per se. It's more of flash backs with many diffrent characters.Some may enjoy that but I did not."
5,Amazing Book,This is an amazing book. The author goes so far into the social minutiae in what would be every day conversation which really makes the reader feel like they are reading a factual documentary.
4,Amazing Zombie Book,I am not a zombie fan. I have seen a few Romero films and they are not for me. I picked this book up because it kept getting recommended over and over. What a gem. The environment is very well thought out especially the military strategies. The author put a lot of time and thought into what would happen globally. This is a good book that you can pick up and put down over a few weeks. I highly recommend it.
3,"Very weak , geopolitical and not many zombies .","I was excited to read this based on the reviews and critical acclaim. As a fan of the genre , I was dissapointed not in the interview format , but the fact that this book is less about a zombie war and more about the politics of dealing with it and its aftermath . there is no terror or edge of your seat excitement in listening to a South African man describe his plan to use the population as live bate and lead the zombies away from the military or some political big wig describe putting a post war population back to work and reconstruction . As a matter of fact , this did not have to be about a zombie war but any kind of war on a global scale. Sorry masses , as a fan of the genre I don't see the appeal here . Check out Day By Day Armageddon by JL Bourne for a really good time ."
3,Just a bunch of good short storys that barely weave together.,"I did not enjoy the way this book is written. Is is many mini encounters/accounts of what happened during World War Z. Just you are getting into a character and what is happening after 2-5 pages... Bam! It is over and you don't go back.Writting is good, but a big part of what makes a Zomibe book good is a connection to character, which you can't have in this book."
5,ZOMBIES!,Could not put this book down! Keeps you on the edge of your seat. Incredible writing! Read it twice. Recommend it to all of my Zombie/doomsday/apocalypse friends.
3,Highly recommended to me but not my style,"This books is very well written. The idea behind it, the style of the narrative, are fairly unique in the seething mass of zombie novels. It consists of many first person accounts of their version of the zombie apocalypse (known as WWZ)I could not get into it at all. I am too much a lover of character development, relationships etc. This is a whole differnt style. I knew that going in, figured it couldn't hurt to try.Like I said, a well written book - just not ""me"" !"
4,Good book,"Very interesting book,give me a new look at the world of zombies.It showed how the world was impected as a whole."
3,Can't Purchase,"The publisher has made it impossible for my to be willing to buy this book. I simply can not pay more for the E-version than the paperback. It should almost be illegal to do so. Kill a tree, waste a box, burn the gas to get it here all for less than a digital transfer. The environment screams."
3,New take on genre - perhaps not as interesting as it could have been,"I am obsessed with post apocalyptic fiction and I enjoyed reading World War Z as it was a different approach to this genre. It was however not as engrossing as I would have liked it to be.The book was set up as transcripts of interviews with survivors from around the world. The author must have done a lot of research as it was full of details about military policies, ranks and geographical information from many different cultures. It gave a lot of different perspectives from officials (military/health/government) rather than regular survivors and it did have a sense of a time line or progression but it didn't feel like it was all tied together. It lacked emotion or a personal perspective. It felt very detached. There was no narrative.I would recommend it as something different. I just wouldn't suggest it is a stand out in its field.Instead try Beyond Armageddon or After Armageddon."
3,Good idea but becomes stale...,"I find that the ""interviews"" in this work are an interesting angle to portray a ficticious event set in current times, in a modern form of media/press. Idea was good. But I found myself wanting to ""just finish the book off"" about 1/3 to 1/2 way through. As mentioned before in a previous review by another person, the dialect of the characters interviewed is all the same. Sort of like if a bad actor played many different roles without engulfing oneself in their culture or socialogical background. One other minute critique I have is that, just when the interviews are getting interesting, they end and another starts. It could just be me though.Overall, its an interesting book, and if you enjoy short stories you might be more into this than I, since there is a lot of start/stop with the interviews, although they all focus around a central theme. If you are looking for horror, Id look somewhere else."
4,..this is the way the world ends...,"Came at this backwards, getting to Brooks' 'Handbook' after his magnum opus. Listening to this on a late night drive from New Mexico to Arizona will keep you awake the whole way. Full of horror, social comment, sarcasm and quirky details, 'WORLD WAR Z"" takes what was once supernatural silliness to an odd level of plausibility. The skills of actors like Mark Hamill, Henry Rollins & Alan Alda (of all people) give this incredible future-history the ring of believability. George Romero must be proud of this red-headed step-child.The Audio Download was no problem at all. Nice source of stuff to feed the iPod."
4,Would you like survivalist fantasies and political satire with your gore?,"If so, this is the one for you. And it shows the various types of appeal of the zombie genre. On the one hand, I've always appreciated zombies, because they give you so many opportunities to fantasize about how you'd fight them. You can talk tactics with other enthusiasts for hours, and this book has plenty of such speculations: What would happen to zombies on the sea floor? What would we do with the frozen ones left after the war? What would happen if you shot one with a laser? And Brooks handles the political satire by wondering what various governments would do if faced with a deadly pandemic, and his speculations are both chilling and funny, because even the good old USA, though it pulls it out in the end, stumbles pretty seriously, and all so plausibly."
2,Not as good as all the hype,"This isn't a story as much as a collection of several dozen short stories. The entire book is a first person, past-tense recollection of events that had already happened. Consequently, there is nothing riveting or suspenseful in the entire book. It hinges on dated pop-culture references, without mentioning any by name, to have some hope having some timeless meaning. Perhaps this could have been a good companion to an actual story, but by itself it is unremarkable. On the cover it mentions a movie is being made of this book. I suspect the movie will be an actual story and consequently have nothing to do with this book beyond the mere mention of zombies. While interesting in the exploration of how the world might (emphasize *might*) react to such a catastrophe, it is an unremarkable book."
2,Kindle Version Ripoff,"I was hoping to buy the Kindle version, but then I noticed that it was $2 more than the paperback version. Why is the Kindle version more expensive than the paperback version? I can understand if it is priced the same or less, but more? Forget it. I realize that it is most likely the publisher's fault and not Amazon's, but unfortunately, neither Amazon nor Brooks will be getting a share from my sale. I will ask my daughter to pick it up at the library instead."
2,Abridged Too Far,"World War Z is a wonderful book and I felt shortchanged with the audio book version. It is well acted and still has an impact, but there is an entire story missing regarding a character that directly interacted with the blind Japanese swordsman, as well as the fate of North Korea and Russia. I thought these were very important aspects in the story and should never have been left out."
4,Suprisingly Good,"I really didn't like the Survival Guide, the writing was terrible. With that in mind I really enjoyed this book. It could have used one more run through to tweak the flow of the novel, and there are some disruptful punctuation problems, but it was very good. Certainly better than any of the other novels in the zombie genre. This may be, in fact, the first literate person to attempt a zombie novel...something I have been waiting to see for a long time now."
4,Unique and a must-have for zombie afficionados,"I picked this up, thinking it would be a decent zombie/thriller/comedy/drama, good for a couple-three afternoons. I didn't expect to be reading a fascinating collection of short narratives posed by a variety of characters over the span of exactly what the title implies. Separated out into various points in the war, it's often quite realistic, and provokes a desperately-needed fresh look into the genre. Definitely worth the buy."
4,Great Read,I loved it; it was interesting and very well paced. The variety of characters was the main reason I enjoyed it.
5,Compellingly Entertaining,"It's rare that I come across a book that I just can't put down, but this was one of them. It is organized like a series of short stories, and each one was so vividly realized that I wanted to know more about that vignette's character. Together, the stories paint an incredibly detailed and believeable picture of what such a conflict might be like. So much so that I found myself occasionally caught in the reality of the book's world when I wasn't reading it. Handled properly, this could be adapted into an incredible film."
4,Very entertaininig.,Interesting approach to the zombie world of literature. Could have used more details on the retaking of the U. S.
5,Awesome Book,Its an awesome book enough said. It is interesting and im really looking forward to the movie version of it.
5,great!,"I listened to this as an audio book. GREAT BOOK! When I saw it in the books store, I thought, ""World War Z? I must have missed that in history class."" I bought it because it sounded amusing. It's very well written and interesting. I don't give out many 5 stars, but this for me was a 5 star read. Maybe because I had low expectations? Who cares, I thoroughly enjoyed it."
4,Road to Zombie Hell and Back,"I had actually picked up this book at local bookshop before and decided then against buying it; It was not before I saw the trailer of the upcoming movie -based on this book - that I finally ordered the ""World War Z"". I am happy I did.During the recent years zobies have become popular in movies, games, books - you name it. While I enjoy a good ""Z"" movie or book one is starting to get a bit fed up with this topic.So I must say that Max Brooks' approach was a refreshing one - the book is kind of scrap book that features interviews of various characters that have participated to the WW ""Z"" . First I thought that this might result in loose and unconnected story - however this is not the case. Instead Mr Brooks succeeds in creating a vivid and credible cronology of the events that nearly exterminates the human race.Highly recommended."
4,Great collection,This book is a great collection of smaller stories telling an overall worldwide tale. I really enjoyed that this book told the stories from other parts of the world in a very realistic way for a very fantastical problem.
3,Good Read. . . .sorta!,"Its a good book. . .but its written as different interviews or accounts. . . most of the different interviews are well written and interesting. . .but some, especially about the political side. . .are extremely boreing!"
5,Best Fiction of 2006,"This suprising piece of imaginative fiction still has me thinking and wondering about real world analogues to zombies and global chaos. Brooks' zombie war comments brilliantly upon parallels in our real political and social world in a way that chews to the bone. Plus, its a fun read. World War Z was, to my own great surprise, the best book I read this year."
3,meh,"decent, but jumps around between different phases of the Z warmore like a collection of short story fragments (scenes?) that the author categorized....If this was the authors intent, then I don't like the format"
5,One of the best zombie books out there,"This is likely my favorite zombie novel ever! Many reviewers before me give you an accurate description of just how this book plays out. Whether you are a long time zombie-romero-end of the world fan, or just getting onto the walking dead band wagon, this novel is a great place to lose yourself for a few hours. Highly recommended! Also check out JL Bourne's Day by Day Armageddon if you liked this!"
5,Now I'm Reading Again...,"Here is the deal. I purchased The Zombie Survival Guide and I liked it so much, I decided to buy this book. At first, I thought I wouldn't like it. I thought that having a book that recounts the events of the Zombie War through the first hand accounts of others wouldn't appeal to me. I was expecting it to be through the eyes of the author. Instead, I found myself entangled in each story, one after the other; as well as how they intertwine and form the separate aspects of the Zombie War, from beginning to end. It was a refreshing read for me. The Zombie Survival Guide and World War Z were the first pieces of fiction I've read since high school over 15 years ago and they jumped started my interest in recreational reading again. Five stars all the way, for this one and for The Zombie Survival Guide as well. Hopefully, we will see more zombie antics from Max Brooks in the near future."
3,Interesting,"Not a bad read at all. Very realistic in its portrayal of subject matter that's been addressed in so very many ways. It wasn't spell-binding reading, but almost like a Discovery Channel documentary. I enjoyed it."
3,Great concept...cheesy dialogue,"The book started out great, but after a while all the dialogue sounded a bit too contrived, like listening to the bit actors in an episode of Law & Order."
5,Loved it!,I was extremely excited to read this book after hearing about it from friends. I was not disappointed one bit. I love the zombie portrayal and the set up of the book. I love that it's a compilation of stories and the way the book ends is fantastic.
3,"Disappointing, despite a good concept","I liked the idea of this book. It's a different take on the zombie genre and I was really rooting for it. Unfortunately, being a collection of interviews with several dozen different people, this book does not create any of the basic elements of a traditional storyline - no buildup of a storyline, suspense, or denouement. It starts off slow, stays quite slow, and ends up just as it started. I would say it's perfectly suited for a graphic novel (comic book). The writing is nothing fancy - just basic. There's really nothing artistic, thrilling, horrifying or suspenseful about the storyline. Basically, if you're looking for a book to read on the train or plane, then this is just right as it doesn't require too much attention."
5,World War Zombies,"The best zombie book I ever read, lives up to its expectations!I bought a copy for my brother and he loved it!"
4,A unique and awesome style,"For those who don't know by now, this book is a collection of 1st person accounts. Effectively it's a cohesive short story collection that maps the Zombie Apocalypse. So rather than falling in love with one character and tracking them through, Brooks gives us a dozen interesting characters to love, hate, root for and hope get eaten. The style is unique enough that I recommend the book to friends and coworkers just for that feel alone.Being a very solid zombie tale itself, without spending too much time trying to science-ize zombies, makes it also an interesting read."
4,Facinating read,"I enjoyed this book. Not a ""horror"" novel per se. (not like, say Stephen King) It's written as if the events actually occurred and the ""author"" compiled a bunch of personal interviews from survivors/participants in the war, giving their different perspectives. It's pretty interesting and I enjoyed the ""true to life"" aspect of it."
3,Not what was expected,"First, not a lot of zombie battles. Then, much more cultural discussion about the way people respond. Some really interesting characters. But the quick on/off stage for some of the most interesting characters was disappointing and ultimately the books grinds to a halt."
3,A fictional documentary that makes you think it's real,"If you're searching for a zombie horror story, you won't exactly find it here.The book feels like a real doxumentary, but like a documentary, it can get sometimes boring and repetitive.Also, there are some holes like how it went in Israel, while tey tell only how it has started there but not how it was dealt with.Also, some parts are highly technical, and some of those technical details repeat themselves in other chapters.Also, it's hard to follow the characters.Another thing is that you won't emotionally attach to the characters, because most of the time they mumble about irrelevant stuff.And at last, don't expect rich language, it's written as if it was transcribed from interviews."
4,You can't go wrong with zombies,"I have a theory about movies. You can't go wrong with films about junkies (Drugstore Cowboy, Trainspotting, Sid and Nancy, etc.), Nazis (Boys from Brazil, Marathon Man, etc.) or Zombies (Night of the Living Dead, Return of the Living Dead, Shaun of the Dead, Fido). It seems that my theory holds up with books, too, at least as far as Zombie books go. Max Brooks did a great job of compiling ""reports"" of survivors of the Zombie War If you enjoyed any of the above-listed zombie movies, you will find World War Z to be a treat. I haven't had the opportunity to check out Brooks' Zombie Survival Guide yet but I do look forward to it. World War Z is definitely worth checking out."
5,A Great Tale of War with Zombies,"I really enjoyed World War Z. I book is well written and very enjoyable. World War Z, feels very realistic, and almost feels as if it happened and I reading about it. The whole epidemic is explained and is quite believable.If you like books about heroes, or deep character development you are in the wrong place. This book is all about the world as a whole. This is the only problem I had with the book is that I got to like the stories of some people and wanted to hear more. Some characters seem to have a very interesting story to tell but are cut short.In short, read this book if you like zombies."
1,A zombie ate Brooks' brain,"When I read Brooks' Complete Zombie Survival Guide, I literally could not put it down until I had read the whole thing. So naturally I was excited to see World War Z on the new release book shelf when it came out and purchased it immediately.I'll be candid and short, this book f****** sucks zombie genitalia. Don't waste your time or money on this complete bore of a book. Aside from the obvious political slant that I take offense to in the writing, the entire thing is just plain boring. What a complete and utter waste of a good concept."
2,Could have been so much more if it was told differently,"The plot for World War Z is a great idea, but the book doesn't take advantage of presenting that plot by using historical interviews. This book would have been awesome if Brooks had revealed the plot through several people currently living the experience. Instead the author just gives a historical account of what happened through a lot of interviews with survivors. For me the result was like watching a documentary on PBS. The entire war lost its excitement, because I pretty much knew what happened and so the interviews were not very suspenseful. They were just informative. I got about half way through the book before I set it down. I just lost interest."
1,Stopped reading it,"Stopped reading WWZ about a quarter of the way into it. It's probably just me but I have to follow characters. The interviewing of random people didn't work for me. Also being a former journalist I hated interviewing people, so my review is probably biased in that sense. I'm sure most readers judging by all the 4-5 star reviews can get over that, I couldn't. I'll see the movie when it comes out."
3,"Less Metaphor, More Zombie Lore, please?","O.K. we all know that Zombies are a prime target for authors wishing to make a metaphorical point. The better ones, like Romero, can do it without sacrificing the quality of their work. Let's face it. Zombie fans do not go to a movie or pick up a Zombie book hoping to find a clever put down of ""mindless consumerism"" (or any other issue, for that matter) concealed within the prose. They go to see or read complete chaos and gratuitous Zombie killing. The problem with World War Z and it's ""oral history"" is that it drags on and on with hundreds of words meant to criticize this or that politician or political policy. Greedy Corporations and inept officials ARE a problem, but do you have to clog up an otherwise very good Zombie book because you've got a political ax to grind? I think liberals and their policies are the most horrible way to run a society ever invented, but I'm not going to write a Zombie book to tell people about it!"
3,It was OK,"My wife and I have a 35 minute commute each way every day. This was good for killing some time. However, the story wasn't that great. It wasn't terrible either."
2,Pretentious,"A classic case of pages being filled with attempts to sound smart. I couldn't care less about what this author considered the history of the war. It was more of a feely feely reflection. I was just barely able to force my way through it, and I don't feel good about doing so. There was hardly any action, and when there was, I didn't really care. I was led to believe that this would be an oral history, not a reflection about how the war made people feel. I didn't buy this to get to understand the people involved in the war, I got it to learn about the war. Disappointing."
2,zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz for sleep inducing,"First, this is not a novel -- it's a book made up of vignettes, so there's no real plot or character development. Second, it's highly focused on policies and strategies -- it reminded me of my husband's Army War College textbooks. If that's your idea of engrossing/interesting reading, you'll enjoy this book!"
4,"Not What I Expected, But Still A Very Good Read","Not really sure what I expected from the book after seeing the movie trailer, but the one thought that kept going through my mind was ""how are they going to make a movie out of this book?"". Notwithstanding, I really enjoyed the book. At various times it made me cry, pissed me off, left me sad and a little hopeful at the same time. The only negative was the constant looking at the index to see what a word or event meant. I felt the author could have just put it in (parenthesis), but that may have just been because it was supposed to read more like a briefing than a book. I will say at times I had to keep reminding myself it wasn't real."
2,boring and dry,"This book was so disappointing. It should have been called An Oral History of Weaponry, since that's what it's really about. Even worse was I had to read over 60 pages to hear the POV of a woman...at first I thought maybe this is just a man's book. Then a man at work saw me reading it on my break and asked me how I liked it, turns out he couldn't get past the 2nd chapter, too boring for him.I hope the movie took a lot of liberties and is better than this."
2,"""They will have to create a whole new tapestry from the pieces of cloth in this book in order to actually make a movie.""","Once you get about 1/3 of the way into this book, you begin to think, ""ok, I get it"" and once you get it, there's not much more to get. This book is like a great piece of work that an author would put together when establishing the backstory for a novel, but it is not itself a novel. It is a large collection of very short stories told by different people about their experiences during the zombie apocalypse. The reader does put pieces together to create the chain of events while reading, but that's about it. There is no main character, except perhaps the interviewer, but he has no real voice in the book. Perhaps the movie will be the story that this book sets up, but don't expect to read this book and then know what the movie will be about, because they will have to create a whole new tapestry from the pieces of cloth in this book in order to actually make a movie."
4,The gratuitous nihilism gets old,"My complaint is that Max's characters all seem similar after while. Each character in the book-Says ""bastard"" at least twice when speaking about others-Soils themselves in times of stress-Drops the F-bomb for no particular reasonThough, the book is a great read.I'll bet the author spent a good potion of his childhood framing his experiences in terms of a zombie invasion. He is so through and detailed in his zombie lore, that the world he paints is truly believable."
5,PROBABLY THE BEST ZOMBIE BOOK EVER....SO FAR...,NOT MUCH TO SAY OTHER THAN READ IT! IF YOU'RE A ZOMBIE FAN THEN THIS BOOK IS FOR YOU.
3,Slightly disappointed,"I thought this would be a novel but its just short stories about the progression of the ""Zombie War."" It was hard to get into. Hopefully the movie will be better."
2,I expected more,"With no offense to the author, I found the book to be disappointly dry. I was expecting a book of retrospective interviews along the line of ""Warday"". The interviewees weren't written in a way that made them particularly interesting. Certainly, those who had survived such a holocaust would be emotionally injured for life. Still, I wanted to care, because I wanted very, very much to enjoy this book."
3,It's okay,"This book is not bad, but jumps around a lot. Just about the time it would start getting into a good part of the story, it would jump to another interview."
3,Good but too quick a read,"I enjoyed the book but was disappointed by the quickness of the read, especially the 12 dollar price. I finished it in 8 hours. I don't think I'd pay $1.50 an hour to read this. That being said, the author did take the story in many interesting direction which showed a lot of imagination. I didn't enjoy the 1st person perspective without the qoutes and descriptions of the characters as they interacted. But I feel this is a common flaw about e-books. Authors write these stories with having alot of dialog or descriptions of the interaction between the characters. I found a lot of space was sucked up by the narrator's dialog which was sized about two levels larger than the people being interviewed. It wasted a lot of space. The book is no better than a 6 buck e-book."
4,Good Read,I liked the book and excited for the movie to come out. The only reason why I did not give it 5 stars is because it is basically a book about short stories.
4,Zombies r not us,If I could give a 4.5 rating I would. Grabs u and all too soon it's done.Thanks for the ride.
3,A zombie war book without the action,"This was a good read, but not exciting or compelling. The author takes great pains to flesh out the world and experiences of survivors from different cultures and parts of the globe. And in this, he does a wonderful job.This was not what I was hoping for, however. The accounts of the zombie attacks are mostly dull recounts. The main exception was an individual in a building when the zombie apocalypse strikes.It is interesting, and the characterization so lacking in many books is very well executed, but overall not the escapist fun I was seeking.If anyone has the same interest or reaction, you might prefer Stephen King's ""Cell."""
3,Petula,"I love The Zombie Survival Guide. I thought this would be as good, but it's only okay. It's a little slow and sometimes boring. I didn't expect it to be exerpts from different parts of the world from different peoples' perspectives so it threw me off guard a bit. Otherwise it's decent. I hope he writes another one that's a little more entertaining......"
3,Did not like the format...,"I am an avid reader but found the format confusing and disjointed. I would have enjoyed this book more if there were not so many separate stories, several of which were tied together at the end as well."
4,Good,Very different but entertainingI'm interested to see how they are going to make it a movie since it has so many different stories
4,Pretty good,"I thought it was an alright book, i feel sometimes it could of finished off the stories better or the stories could go on for a little longer."
5,Top zombie book of all time.,This book is simply a masterpiece in the zombie genre.Read it and you'll see what I mean.
4,World War Z is great!!!!!!,"When someone asks you what the book your reading is about and you say, ""Zombies"" some people will dismiss you. This book is the prize for not having such bias. This book can stand along books in any other genre. It is well written and includes social and political commentary that will cement it in place as a literary place marker for our times. The gritty personal stories that make up this book will suck you in. Max Brooks pays great attention to detail and weaves it through the stories and characters so well that the fact that they are fighting zombies never seems corny. By the end of the first interview in the book you won't think twice about zombies. By the end of the book you'll have your own plan of action ""if that ever does happen."" If not Max wrote that too! Personally I'll read whatever Max Brooks writes next because of this book, I have recommended this book to everybody."
5,Best than I tought,"I'm a hardcore fan of zombies and I've read tons of books of the issue, and I have to say that WORLD WAR Z is one of the best EVER books I ever read. It's creepy, scary and fresh. It's not the classic ""survival"" book, but an intense over-the-world history about the Zombie Outbreak. It's a must have and you really WANT this book. ¡Viva México!"
4,Too bad it was the abridged.,"Had it not been the abridged version it probably would have gotten 5 stars... It was actually really good. Now that its been a couple weeks I think I will listen to it again. You can't help but wonder if some of the things would actually happen durning ""world war z"". Its a good listen if your driving down the road wondering ""What if"". I enjoyed each of the short ""interviews""/ stories. I love zombies"
2,Just didn't do it for me,"Picked this one up in the airport and was really disappointed. I just don't think it knows what it wants to be. It's not fun, like hanging out in the mall with the zombie horde waiting outside and it's not believable. The author tries to make you believe his knowledge of the real world, governments and politics are accurate and believable.Not impressed."
3,interesting read.,"I was looking for something to read and a co worker said that this was a great read. I was hooked after the first few accounts of the zombie war. I have never heard of Max Brooks, but would read him again. I like the war the story is pieced together from different perspectives, and geographical locations. At first, you may find it difficult to follow the event, but it all comes together pretty quickly as episodes are filled in on the war spread.I recommend this book to anyone interested in zombies, kinda a requirement, and anyone looking for a fun, quick read."
3,Slow but not terrible,"Overall this book was ok. Not terrible, not great. The story moved forward with each chapter being told from a different person's perspective. This prevented me from connecting with the book, as the main character in the book (other than the narrator who is really just reporting) is humanity as a whole. It had interesting stories but there wasn't any action driving the book forward. It was easy for me to put it down. I don't regret reading it, but it wasn't one of my favorites."
4,More Zombies,Very well written. Had some very good insights into different countries responses to really any catastropicdisaster. Writing style as an interview was excellent.
3,Interview style didn't work for me,"The interview style of the writing just didn't make the book flow for me. Really hard to get into a book when the characters constantly change. Even a tad confusing the way the interviews bounced back and forth to all different parts of the world. I didn't even realize that one of the US military officers had multiple interviews scattered throughout the book until I was near the end. It just felt so disjointed to me.There were some good interesting stories but there were some incredibly boring ones too. Even the good ones were a little disappointing because once I finally found a story I enjoyed and began to get into the book, the story ended.Not terrible, but not a masterpiece either. Enjoyed the ""Day by Day Armageddon"" series much more. Not really sure how the movie is going to turn out. What character is Brad Pitt going to play? There weren't really any main characters.Obviously the interview style wasn't a problem for most, but for me it just didn't work."
4,Better than a sharp stick in the eye.,"I am glad that I read World War Z. I was excited to receive and read this book. I haven't had the opportunity to read many zombie stories and don't have much to compare it with. Some of the chapters were very good and others seemed plain and less than exciting. A good read, I really liked the perspective that the author took to tell the story."
5,Hail the Zombie War,"The perspective threw me off a little, it is done as a collection of interveiws, but I quickly got past that as the story drew me in. It is a must for Zombie lovers and those who enjoy psycological studies on human kind."
3,differnet,"A different taken the zombie, viral apocalypse. looking back at it. Worth a read for a night of light entertaining reading."
3,Didn't infect me,"Perhaps it was because the book is as exciting as an Associated Press report. Many of the characters are boring, it's ridden with clichés, there's little that stitches the story together, the political mumbo-jumbo and jargon plagues the writing as a pack of ravenous zombies. The book as a whole is a collection of vignettes covering a genre that has been beyond overdone. Do yourselves a favor and skip this, find The Walking Dead graphic novels (not the mediocre TV adaptation) and give it a try."
4,Different Perspectives Add to Story,"Effective way to tell a story with global impact. The short tales vary greatly depending on the perspective of the person talking. While a bit confusing at first, you quickly begin to feel what it would be like to survive such an event. Great book."
3,Solid But Not the The Best Ever,"Max Brooks World War Z is a very interesting take of Zombpocalypse from a macro level, 10,000 foot view. He does a very good job in researching such entities as the World Health Organization and standard govt/military procedures to global emergencies and quarantine shut downs. The result is a highly realistic zombie novel that feels more eerie than outright grisly. The writing is competent but there are no memorable characters and as such I can't recommend this as top shelf zombie fiction. Those laurels belong to I AM LEGEND, HANDLING THE UNDEAD by John Lindqvist and a very demented, newly minted genetic science take on the genre called BLUE BLOODBATH by Katrina Von Kessel, which i highly recommend."
2,Edgy = Annoying,"Although fairly well written, the dominating social agenda is highly distracting. This book is far more concerned with criticizing government (and government entities) than telling a fun and fictional story."
2,Disappointing and just boring,"I really enjoy survival, apocalyptic stuff and if it includes zombies...all the better. This book was a snooze though, less than half of the interviews were exciting and if you did start on one you liked it was over in just a couple pages...then on to a completely different interview that was in all likelihood just boring. I think this could have been better if it was only 4-5 larger interviews instead of a number of small 6-12 page interviews. It was hard to finish to be quite honest and I love this genre and couldn't wait to read this book...just disappointing...that's all I can think of when I see this book on my shelf."
3,Thought it was going to be funny...,"I kinda thought this was supposed to be funny. It is here and there but for the most part it's a straight faced telling of the zombie war. The idea seems funny, but loses its charm after a while. Not that its boring, just not super entertaining."
1,Absolutely Poor Quality Control.,"This book was not cut at a 45 degree angle. It is almost 10 degrees off of square. Absolutely should NOT have made it past any quality control check. Big disappointment, Amazon."
1,Very disappointed,Bought this book after reading reviews. But it was wordy and very hard to follow. Not what I was expecting
3,Interesting read.,"Could have done with out all the leftist junk, but it was an interesting and different way to tell a story."
3,"Excellent premise, but the execution could have been better","I was so hyped for this book - I love this stuff! I'm also a huge fan of the Zombie Survival Guide. While the premise was promising, I found the execution lacking. I really wish the author would have done more linguistic research. When reading an interview of a someone from China, for example, I would try to picture a television interview with sub-titles. The problem is, the words used and the phrasing/cadence were all very much American - for ALL interviews; none of the text read as authentic to me and that really jarred me out of the writing. That and the fact that all American's sound like drunk Texans with the need to swear constantly put me off. Don't get me wrong - I don't mind swearing at all. It's just that I wanted more variety and real personality in the people being interviewed, but they all read like a slight variation of the same character."
2,Interesting but flawed,"The premise is interesting and some of the stories are entertaining but as others have indicated the military interviews are so lacking in credibility that they border on ridiculous. The author clearly did a great deal of research on weapons systems but his knowledge of military culture and thinking is unsophisticated at best and an embarrassing caricature at worst. At these points it devolves into puerile teenage boy gizmo fantasy writing. The audiobook version gets very tedious in these sections and the ""testimony"" from various actors is too often contrived and histrionic.I guess it is just meant as harmless fun but for all the tedious details he often gets it wrong."
1,good idea poorly executed,"Unfortunately I have to say I was disapointed with the book. I am a fan of horror books, and really like the zombie theme and was expecting something easy to read and interesting. The book is a collection of ""interviews"" with survivors, with sounds cool and all but in the end turns out to be the biggest flaw. To put it directly, the author is just not good enough to pull of the trick. Instead of leaving with the feeling that you heard numerous voices, it is like all of the different characters are the same, they sound the same, despite being from completely different backgrounds. A classic case of a good idea poorly executed. Especially in the case of far fetched histories like zombie apocalypses the writing has to be good to make you believe in the characters, and for me this is just not the case here."
5,cool,"Good book, cant wait for the movie to come out. I finished it in two weeks. It was awesome bro."
3,Zombies were boring.,"Thought it was to long.Could of had more indepth stories. Didnt really understand alot of it, couldn't get into it."
2,Boring,"At first it was cool. It is structured as a series of interviews, so it's really a whole bunch of first-person narratives of the same event.The problem is they got boring. He cuts off every one of these interviews to leave the story incomplete, really because he's out of fresh material, so they become boring.I hope the movie is better than the book."
5,worth of the praise it's gotten so far,"Very good read. There could have been a few details that were described better, such as what exactly the 'lobo' looks like....but other then that, you really get the feeling that it's been a decade since the zombie war. Rather then delve deeply into a few particular stories, Max gives every aspect of the Z war a medium depth overview. Enough for you to understand and relate to each aspect: the front line soldiers, the doctors, dog handlers, homefront, the aftermath, the clean-up operations.....You get a taste of every aspect of the Z war.This is a worthy addition to anyone's zombie collection."
4,Thanks to Max Brooks!,"Brooks has made the Zombie phenomena more mainstream than I would have thought possible. While seemingly written just for fun, he also manages to depict some of the menace of the threat from the undead. My sons and I have a lot of fun discussing what we would do if zombies were real. Thanks to Brooks for making Zombies fun and interesting.If you like this books, you might enjoy the following 3200-word short story for only 99 cents:Gladitorium Immortuos"
4,Very Good,"When I first started reading World War Z, it took a few chapters for me to get into the writing. This is not a typical novel with characters you're rooting for. There is no storyline, no heroes.It's written by a ""reporter"" who went out and interviewed various people, in various countries, about their personal experience in this war. Each story is unique to whomever's being interviewed. The only thing they have in common, is the zombie war.As I was reading, I started to actually believe it happened,that a zombie epidemic took over the world. It was unreal how this book dragged me in. The stories are first hand accounts of how they survived the epidemic. Where they were, what they did, how they got out, and how they fought. Each one reads like a short auto-biography.I was very impressed with the way it flowed, and taken by complete surpise at how much I enjoyed it, as I'm not a fan of the Zombie genre."
1,Life is too short to read bad books,"This is was one of the worst books that I read for a long time. He is just working the cliches over and over again. There is nothing new or original. It is hard to understand how this book got such a hype. Even if this was free, I wouldn't recommend anybody to read it."
2,boring waste of money,who would have though a book about zombies could be so boring. i had to make myself finish it. waste of money dont buy it
2,Thin on suspense and action,"I have pretty low standards when it comes to zombie books, but I think this book dipped below that standard by a bit. This book is organized into chapters that are little summaries of this or that event. There is really cool zombie stuff in each, but it's not pitched in a compelling storyline...just the sort of text that a government agency would commission. I understand that that's the whole point of the book, and that it's trying to be literary. All I'm saying is that if you like a novel with a gradual creeping up a tension, this is not going to be satisfying. You'll end up skipping the 2-3 pages of character development in each chapter that have nothing, absolutely nothing, to do with the zombie theme."
2,"Not bad, but too Choppy","I guess I'm in the majority, but I really didn't like this book. I couldn't even finish it. The style of the book is written in various accounts, but it isn't accounts integrated in to the story...it's just account after account after account. It's not seamless and I just couldn't get in to it."
2,World War zzzzzzzzzzz,"To put it simply, this is boring in comparison to the Zombie Survival Guide. the ZSG was at least funny as hell. World War Z is boring. It should be called World War zzzzzzzzzzz. It's actually quite easy to put down. I hope Max writes a more interesting or funny book next time."
1,disapointing,"I bought the book to read because I saw the movie trailer. It was a lousy read, there really is no story. I would not waste my time or money buying it. Just wait for the movie. It has to be better!"
2,Sooooo Boring,"I love zombies, so I bought this thinking it would be a great zombie book. Wrong. It is sooooooo boring. Jusdt a compilation of stories from people who survived the zombie apocalypse but they are a collection of small stories that just plod along and never get exciting in any way. I feelt like I am reading a high schoolers term paper. I put the book down halfway through."
2,I was really disappointed in this book.,"I really, really wanted to like this book but it was not a good read for me. I kept pushing forward hoping it would get better but it just continued in the same droll way. Interview style writing is okay with me, at least I thought so. It was more the lack of character development within each interview. There are plenty of short story Z books out there that have better character development and shorter chapters than World War Z. I was expecting to really enjoy this book, otherwise I wouldn't have spent my money on it. I like to re-read my Z books but I don't think I will do that with this book. Bummer."
2,"Zombies? In this book, not credible or even very interesting.","Compared to Justin Cronin's series about vampires, the Zombie Wars book suffers badly, mostly in the incredibility of its basic premise (what are zombies and where do they come from?). Cronin's explanation for the origins, nature and physiology of vampires is believable and quite compelling; Brooks' explanation for zombies (a virus that ""reanimates"" the brains of the dead, enabling the body to live, sort of, as long as the brain isn't destroyed) has no possible basis in science; and his zombies are therefore incredibly uninteresting. The only problem humanity has to solve with the zombies is how to kill them efficiently and in large numbers by destroying their brains. It's a pity that Brooks never addresses this fundamental problem since he writes well, and his war ""documentary"" includes a number of ""interviews"" that are quite clever."
4,Good book,"Can't wait till the movie. Not real sure how they will do that, seeing the book is collection if short stories."
1,Try To Stay Wake. Impossible!,Too Political. Too Long. Too Boring. Maybe The Movie Will Better. It Was Recommended To Me. Maybe I Was Being Punished
4,The title says it all,"I have not read another zombie novel, and probably will not read one, but I'm glad that my book club partner chose this one. The oral history format, with many different voices and points of view from around the world, is handled well.The author has written extensively about zombies, and this gives credibility to the incredible subject."
4,Not a normal read,I have never read zombie books. This was a great read though. The characters were well used. A few times I even felt I was there.
2,Don't like the structure,"I guess it's a cool idea to structure it like real documents, but I want to read a story when I choose a novel, not bits and pieces of things with footnotes. I head this was good, but I only read about 15 pages and lost interest."
3,Great.....at the beginning,"The book starts out great with tales of how many people combated the zombie virus. It did its job, and that was to drag the reader in. About halfway through the book it switches to the political aspect of the zombie virus and then it just drags on and on until you can't wait till the end of the book"
5,Please don't let them make it into a movie,Excellent read! I now need to totally revamp my defense plans. I had no idea they could move under water. Sigh!
2,Ugh....,"For my zombie books, I guess I'm more of an action-oriented guy. This focused so extensively on the societal impact of the zombie apocalypse that I completely lost interest in the book. I want action and suspense and fast-paced story development. This book was just so slow and blah. I found that I actually started skipping paragraphs just so that I could get to the end as quickly as possible."
5,Brilliant concept. Impeccable Execution,"With 616 five-star-reviews as of this moment, there is absolutely no reason for me to review this book except that I feel compelled to add to the chorus of people who loved this book. It was, by orders of magnitude, the most interesting book I read in 2011.I am not a fan of zombies. I don't read horror. I am not a survivalist, I do not enjoy dystopian literature, I don't believe in the apocalypse. And yet, I loved the heck out of this book. It was brilliantly written -- an exposition on the darker side of humanity. In many ways, it is possible for the reader to insert any biological calamity for the zombie apocalypse and imagine the exact same behavior occurring as was described in World War Z. The political commentary is scathing, the indictment of the dark side of capitalism compelling, and the description of the capacity for heroism inherent in every human being was oddly inspiring.Max Brooks is brilliant. I'm not kidding."
5,World War Z: An Oral History of the Zombie War,Great book. Absolutely a must have for anybody who is a fan of the zombie genera. I would absolutly recommend this to a friend. 5 GOLDEN STARS!
2,I know I'm in the minority here...,"...but I just didn't like it. Like reading outtakes from the Warren Commission or the 9/11 Report, the insight into how a disaster happened after the fact just doesn't satisfy my need for ""problem, suspense, crescendo, solution"" reading entertainment. This may be one of those rare ones where the movie will be better."
4,"Buy the ticket, take the ride","Having already read the Zombie Survival Guide, and knowing the movie comes out next year, I decided to get on the ball to read WWZ. If you've read the description, you know the general idea. The book is a series of interviews with survivors of the Zombie uprising. It reads as a possible postscript to any of the classic Romero films, if someone was optimistic enough to think that humanity would ultimately come together and triumph over the undead and rebuild society. What's most impressive about the book is that Brooks has thought of nearly everything. He paints a portrait of the zombie war as it's fought in South Africa, China, Japan, Paris and North America. There's civilian perspectives, military, medical and philosophical. By the end, you've been through the World War Z, and you've survived."
5,Good zombie read.,This was my first zombie book I have read besides the walking dead comics. It was a combination of a bunch of short stories that all came together to tell how the war started and goes through individual stories or highlights of the war. It was entertaining and a quick read.
4,Good read,Well-done scenario that gave verisimilitude. Populated with some interesting characters. I don't expect the movie to be anything like the book.
4,Zombie Novel in a Compelling and Intellectual Format,Did you ever wonder how the prototypical zombie apocolypse actually spread around the globe? Or what was the political reaction to zombies in Israel and North Korea? Or what happened to all the house cats left behind? This novel is for you.
3,So-so,"I enjoy zombie books but this one can be as dissapointing as it is fun. It reads like a collection of short stories. While each one is good, it still leaves you wanting more than just that. Goes to show that the whole is more than the sum of its parts."
4,great book,Book got here in good time. It was a great book. Loved the realism behind the fantasy type story.
3,Good idea but kind of drags...audio much better,"enjoyed it to a point, but got bored.it sure has a lot of good ratings...but i just couldn't keep my eyes open after a while.but the audio version was much better.i was also left wondering about the cause of the plague, the medical side of prevention, etc. maybe that was out of scope?"
5,Review,"I absolutely love this product. Even tho it's a scrub, it doesn't feel like you're rubbing sandpaper on your face. And it makes your skin feel soft and smooth after"
5,Great product,I moved to Portland OR about a year ago and without transportation and no walmart's i am lost. i ordered this and later found it in a grocery store here. Great product but you can most definitely find it cheaper locally.
1,be cautious,"Carcinogenic ingredients: diazolidinyl area releases formaldehyde. Sodium lauryl sulfate, methyl and propyl parabens have negative effects on natural hormone balance."
3,O.k. for the money,"I find this leaves a residual feeling of ""film-y-ness"" of itself on my face after use. Not just the good tingly feeling, either.The product is tingly & refreshing & the price is right for the product, hence the three stars. Don't forget, there is the s&h; charge, too.However, I will go back to St. Ives apricot scrub after this is used up (maybe even before). The price is right for their products, too. Especially at places like CVS that give out discount coupons regularly.I've used St. Ives for years. Never had any residual feeling after use, price is always good & (as far as I can recall) products are natural.UPDATE: 4/5/09....I just saw that Amazon is now selling a six pack of St. Ives apricot scrub w/their free S&H....; best deal I've seen on this scrub. Highly recommend."
3,ok product Fast seller,I have very sensitive skin so I am actually writing a review on the seller. theywere very quick in shipping and the product price was great. would purchase something else from this seller
5,"Good, concise, and straigt to the point.","I seem to learn and retain the material better when there is a matter a fact approach relating to all the important factors that needs to be learned, and this book does just that! This series is awesome!"
2,movie was boring,I really had to caffeinate myself quite a lot to stay interested in the story line. A better movie along the same lines is Leap of Faith with Steve Martin.
1,You have GOT to be kidding!,Never in my life have I seen such a piece of total crap. This movie stunk up my house. I had to light candles all over the house to get the stench out. Dear Lord (no pun intended)! I'm ashamed to admit I was in this stinker.
1,Wrong part,I checked twice to make sure this was the right part. It is not. This fits the 02 dodge 1500 not the 2500. I even rechecked after I recieved this item. It shows it as the right number but its not. The quality looks ok but I didnt open it so I can't say for sure.
1,Get past the title and it's all a sham,"I walk in to Barnes & Noble nad stroll over the Business section and there is a new book with a catchy title and subtitle; ""Leading Leaders"", ""How to manage smart talented, rich and powerful people""What you get is more of the Communists News Network (CNN) useless diatribe on how the war on terror and Iraq are failures and that the President can be held in contempt because we have the freedom of speech.Mr Salacuse writing style is both reckless and irresponsile.What a farce."
3,"Interesting context, but a slow read","If carnivals and sideshows are of great interest to you, this book may be worth a read. However, if you've read much about carnivals and sideshows, I think you'll find this book is a repeat of information which you've seen before.This book will remind you of reading school books - written by a teacher - you think you'll be tested on the content."
1,Stick With Flatland,"Sphereland, which is supposed to be a sequel of sorts to the wildly entertaining and thought-provoking classic Flatland, is poorly written sludge. Do yourself a favor, and resist any urge to pick it up, it does Edwin Abbot's book no justice whatsoever."
4,"BEST IN CLASS, THOUGH NOT THAT GOOD","Among all guidebooks I have seen on the Amazon, this one did the best job of gathering information and putting it in an easily readable fashion.The book is divided among the different countries in the region. Knowing the attractions mainly of the Brazilian Amazon, I can say that about half of the businesses, phone numbers, addresses, etc. are outdated. It is to be expected, since this guide was published 4 yrs ago. The Brazilian section is good, with good advice especially on the surroundings of Manaus. It also provides good advice on what to bring and what to look for in the Amazon, which is useful and timeless.To someone considering a trip to different places in the Amazon, if you want to get just one guide, I would recommend this one. If you are going to just one place, perhaps as a second guide book this would help, but I would not rely too heavily on the companies listed there, many of them no longer exist."
1,this book was not what i had expected...,i found the book to be over written and pompous. Far too academic in tone.
3,Luso Trancers Score Big,"I picked up this album while visiting the Azores island of Terceira. The attendant working the record store pointed out this band after I had asked for some Kruder & Dorfmeister-like sounds. I went home, put on this CD, and was soothed by the soft sounds and delicate percussion. Although not as sonically complex as a K&D or Tosca product, Cool Hipnoise deliver on their ambient/trance efforts. Of course, the beauty of this genre is the lack of geographical identity; Portuguese, German, American, be what you want, the sounds are agnostic. Except for the occassional Portuguese vocals delivered by talented local voiceboxes, you'll be glad to go for a ride with these Lisbonites, and even more pleased that you'll know not where you left from and where you'll arrive."
3,A little much,"This sure would be useful. But for $67 I can practically buy a new laser printer. For $30 (like the last one that sold), it's a reasonable investment in a 15 year old printer."
1,don't bother,"I've read many different books related to hormone problems due to my diagnosis w/PCOS. This book contains very little information - just skims over the issues of hormonal health and hormonal problems. I was hoping for a book on hormone health through nutrition but, this book has only 1-2 paragraphs on diet changes and the recommendations are not very specific. There are much better books available that contains more detailed information!!"
4,Works well,"I use my NDAS all day every day. The install went well and fast. The only downfall to this unit is that the enclosure doesn't have a fan. Extended use of the device yields high temps inside the enclosure. I suggest keeping this away from sunlight (obviously) and in a cool location. Other than that, works well"
2,Not compitable with dell inspiron 9300,"With the driver installed, windows XP shows blue screen. Even after a windows reinstall and downloading latest driver from Ximeta, the dell still shows blue screen. In the end, I was unable to use it in past two years. I wish that Ximeta issue a drive which can be certified to XP.2 stars, because my other NAS drive from CompUSA(bought cheap on Ebay) works without much problem."
4,Not really a true NAS,"This unit is built nice, but if you are looking for a true network attached storage via ethernet, this is not it. What it is, it works. You have to load proprietary software on each machine before it can ""see"" the unit. I don't really mind as it is definately a secure way of doing things. Very fast interface and multi-users can access. You can also use it as an external USB device as there is a plug for that too. In all, it works well, but not a true NAS in that sense."
5,"very complete NAS solution, although non-standard","while you must use non-standard drivers to access these NAS devices, they do excel over standard NAS shares in 2 areas:1) they seem to perform better. I can always mount these devices while I often have problems mounting standard MS Windows shares. They seem to work better on busy networks than standard device shares.2) the custom drivers include the ability to bind 2 devices together over the lan for RAID-1 support. This means you can locate the 2 parts of the bound RAID-1 device in separate areas of your site (as long as they share a common lan segment) and provide better disaster coverage. If you lose one to some site problem, you stand a better chance of not losing your data if the other one is located elsewhere.I have 4 of these and stand by them."
5,Care Bears CD,"This is great for my four year-old who loves Care Bears. Simple to learn games that are hard enough to keep children challenged. Lots of color and kids' favorites--balloons, cupcakes, rainbows, hearts."
2,Not what it's cracked up to be.,"At first I thought this would be neat for my 3 1/2-year old daughter, but I was disappointed. Some items are very hard and past her abilities at this time (the bubble game). Others are right up her alley (the matching game). The various games advance levels as you complete a level, but only 4 levels exist in each game, and there's nowhere to go after that. She was quickly bored, and the games she was not ready for brought out her frustration."
1,Disappointed in vendor,"I tried to purchase thee in November 2010 and the vendor just cancelled my order as they were out of stock and the vendor did not have any idea when they would become available again, they simply canceled my order from Amazon and it just disappeared as if I'd never ordered them. So: 1) Out of Stock. 2) No know restock date; perhaps never. 3) Order gone from my listing of Amazon orders; would prefer record of it remains."
5,"Silver Lining, Tied in Bows","Simply a stunning story, not of romance, but of love. You feel like your riding along with Ben and Amber in her silver streak of a car without a seatbelt to the very end. Sometimes the road gets bumpy, sometimes scary indeed. It's a chance meeting, a delightful roadtrip, a face-to-face look at life, and a lesson in living it. Ms. Haley is a rising star among independent authors. The honesty and warmth of this story beats anything I've read on the New York Best Seller list in years. Take it to your heart and you'll see rainbows, maybe even double rainbows."
5,Absolutely beautifully written,"What a beautiful story, and so well written. You feel like you are part of the story and get so involved with people that you don't want it to end. I think I'll read it again.This story would make a great movie! Susan Haley, thank you for this book and when are you writing more????"
5,The Audio of this Riveting Story Brings These Characters to Life,"When viewing a Chuck Close canvas, one needs to step back a bit to appreciate it full essence. Such is the case with the power of this wonderful novel. A riveting story is only part of what makes Rainy Day People such a success. The artistry involved in crafting this work enticed me to move from audio to hard copy, then back to audio once again. Through these dual modalities of sight and sound, I was flooded with the very emotions this author's words were meant to evoke. All sensibilities were heightened: sight, sound, touch . . . but foremost, the all-to-human feelings surrounding the experiences of love and vulnerability. Susan Haley is one talented writer. Keep an eye on her. I know I will.Lois W. STernAuthor of SEX, LIES AND COSMETIC SURGERY"
3,Does not contain motor! Disappointed!,"We purchased two of these for birthday gifts, and were very disappointed to discover that they do not contain motors. It is very clearly stated in the information in two places that this kit contains a bonus motor, and it does NOT! Do not be fooled by the advertising. If this is worth it to you without the motor, then by all means, purchase it."
2,Poor Quality Control,"My first pair was perfect but the plastic soles got too hard and brittle after the 2nd year and broke away from the stitching that connected the upper to the soles. So I ordered another pair and altough both soles were size 10, the upper band that goes across the top of your foot was one inch shorter on the right slipper. VERY disappointing poor quality control for a company like Minnetonka!"
2,Don't Buy For Wide Feet,"I haven't worn slippers in years. I wear about an 8 shoe size in mens, so without guessing, I got an 8. I knew my feet were wide, but nothing to write home about. My right foot fit into the slipper very snug, and couldn't get in past my toes on the left. I held it up to my foot and I could fit a finger and a half next to the slipper to be about as wide as my foot. I am not sure who Minnetonka uses to base their footboards on but they have quite narrow feet. After submitting a rebate for these, I was quite sad to see there isn't a wide model."
5,Love these slippers! Sizes run small...,"I was looking for a warm slipper that didn't look like they belonged to Grandpa but kept my usually cold feet warm. These really fit the bill (in black, so no soil marks). Perfect for indoors and for running to the garage, taking out the garbage, and so on. Just bought a second pair for very fussy significant other. NOTE: These slippers are sized too small. I wear a 10 but the 10 was very tight. I swapped for 11s and they fit the bill. Same with another shoe from the same maker. Order one size larger than you normally wear and you should get a good fit."
2,"Great uppers, LOUSY sole!","These slippers are comfortable and warm, and are made from high-quality sheepskin. The soles are another matter, entirely: I owned a pair for less than a year, and the outsoles tore on the sides where the stitching connects them to the upper. I repaired them by hand (I used to repair shoes), and (thinking I had somehow misued them)I purchased a second pair. The second pair fell apart the same way after less than two months of use. Minnetonka seems to be using an inferior grade of synthetic rubber for their outsoles. It actually crumbles with repeated flexing. This should NOT happen at this price level. I will not buy this brand again."
5,hiphop the best music,This music is a filosophy of my days. she is my past and my present. Manual was the best album from da weasel. I love da weasel and all hiphop music*
4,Good Watch,Good watch. Keeps better time than my automatic Tag (so far at least). The back has a crystal so you can see the internal movements--pretty cool. I've gotten quite a few compliments on it.
1,"Friends of punctuation and grammar, beware!","It's tough when a book with so much potential is sunk by a total lack of editing. The glaring punctutation and grammar errors were so severe and numerous it made it difficult to read this book; the natural flow of thought kept getting interrupted. The disjointed jumps from one scene to another, with little or no transition, made it hard to follow the action. Most characters where undeveloped. Hire a good editor, rewrite the book, and you just might have something worth reading."
5,Worked for me,Connected a PCI-e 1x Firewire card to a PCI-e x16 slot in my media PC. Didn't quite fit my oddball case layout but the card to mother board connection was entirely successful.
4,Canon EF 16-35mm f/2.8L II Wide Angle Zoom Lens,"""The Canon EF 16-35mm f/2.8L II was able to produce a very good performance in most aspects. The center resolution of the lens is exceptionally high regardless of the zoom and aperture settings. The border performance is lower specifically towards the extreme ends of the zoom range and at large aperture settings.... The build quality of the lens is great and it is a joy to use."""
5,Amazing Lens,This lens is absolutely amazing and worth every penny. It's sharp throughout the range and it feels like I am shooting with a prime. I highly recommend this lens.
4,Worth the price over the 17-40mm f/4,I have both the 16-35MM II and the 17-40mm. At the end of the day the images produced by both lenses are sharp. The main difference is the speed. f/2.8 v f/4. When daylight turns to dusk and you're still shooting (ambient light) the option to open up the lens makes it worth it.Sure its twice the price but the ability to gather more light to get those shots makes it worth it.
5,Great lens!,"I was originally looking to get aCanon EF 24-70mm f/2.8L USM, for the focal length and glass speed. Taking into consideration that my 40D has a FOVCF of 1.6, I opted to get the EF 16-35mm f/2.8 -- the equivalent focal length is close enough to what I was looking for. I don't regret making that decision at all. This is an awesome lens."
4,$2200+..REALLY?,"Ok folks... I bought this wonderful lens about 12 weeks ago for maybe $1400. I've used it for landscape work and it does a fine job..not great at 16 in terms of sharpness and never great at any length at the corners. I also use a 24mm TS-E and a 17mm TS-E. (and a 35mm 1.4) all of these are better lenses in terms of sharpness...the 24mm TS-E in particular is crazy sharp (and cool). So, if canon/retail wants to try to gouge $2200 (current listing 4/30/2011) of your hard earned $$ for this lens just say no...it is not worth that kind of money....its a great lens at sub $1700 but after that it makes more sense to look at high quality fast primes (24/35).Update...Pricing has dropped to a more reasonable rate..still a few hundred more than last year..but still ... its a fine lens..recently I've been using it to shoot bike racing (hobby)...and its been terrific...shooting from the hip on AF...nice.."
5,Best pics.,I do real estate photos - and this camera pano has given me the best photos! I can get the whole room. The pictures are clear and professional looking. Great for landscapes!I love love love this lens!
