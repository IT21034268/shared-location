2,Not happy,I wasn't aware this product didn't come with the attachment vacuum hose. Can't use. I'm very disappointed in the description.
3,Vac lid,Does not always work. I find it very fussy on what and how it works. Should be more detailed instructions to avoid frustation.
5,GREAT SEALER,"LOVE .. LOVE this jar sealer. Works everytime I use it. I use it to seal flour , cornmeal and stuff like that to it fresh. Works everytime. Great product.Keeps food and snacks fresh in jars. Really a money saver.I would recommend this to anyone wanting to save a little money and keep foods fresh."
4,Works just like it should,"Not a lot to say, it works exactly like it should. Nothing complicated, put it over the jar/cap and put your hand held pump over the hole. It does a nice job."
5,Great item!,"This is a great item! Very helpful for keeping food fresher longer, or for sealing dry goods for longer term storage. Can go right into the fridge."
5,Works great,The wide-mouth sealer seals more easily than the regular-mouth sealer does. I like both sizes of the sealers but prefer the wide-mouth for ease of sealing and because the wide mouth is easier to use because you can fit you hand inside the jar. I would definitely recommend this product.
5,Great product!!,Perfect for sealing my wide mouth jars. Exactly as expected. I highly recommend this product if you have a Foodsaver!
5,This works great,Ordered on Wednesday night and got it at noontime Friday. Thanks guys. This works great with my off brand hand held bag sealing vacuum pump. It seals tight to Mason Jars to help form a cheap vacuum chamber.
4,Love my FoodSaver!,"While the FoodSaver is my new favorite kitchen toy, and I've saved lots of money on foods that have not 'perished', the plastic rolls are expensive. By investing in a case of Mason jars and this handy-dandy product, I can save and reuse the jars for nearly ever! It is a little tricky to seat the lid just so, but once you get the hang of it, it's easy and you can keep all kinds of things for much longer than before. I haven't thrown away any cheese since I got the FoodSaver...mold just doesn't form on sealed cheese! And the Mason jars work for all kinds of leftovers, cookies, crudite, items bought in bulk, nearly anything."
5,Good product,"This sealer works great. It is much more reliable than the plastic containers food saver sells. Works with various size mason jars, and the seal he been holding for over a month so far"
4,Love contents,"The CD of ""Archy and Mehitabel"" was everthing I had hoped for. (For Carol Channing lovers this is a must hear.) However, the jewel case arrived with a crack in the plastic cover. Packaging could have been better. The CD was not damaged."
3,3stars instead of 5,"I give this amusing story 3 stars.I first got to know the version with Eartha Kitt as Mehitabel ( known as ""Shinbone Alley"")and really got stuck to that one. THAT is the one that I rate 5 stars !!!a 2-CD set was released of it and I also heard Eartha together with Eddie Bracken perform the play on BBC radio , live in the early 1990s."
4,Great reference,"This is not a book that you will read end-to-end. It's got little overview sections before the configuration chapters that explain Kerberos, AAA .... The true power of the book lies in the handiness of having the information in an easy-to-reference place, rather than the nightmare that is CCO's search engine. I didn't give it 5 stars because it was not a groundbreaker like Doyle's book, but it is worth the money if you are interested in implementing some of the more complex security features in the 12.x IOSs."
1,AWFUL!,"I think the other reviews don't adequately state how really thin and awful this stuff is. Unless you have a reason for wanting tp that's thinner than tissue paper, don't get it - you'll be unhappy. If you're trying to help the environment with your purchase, try 7th Generation."
4,Scott Rapid-Dissolving Toilet Paper,"As this tp is recommended for septic systems, I decided to try it. You get a big roll and the paper is one-ply, very thin. I'm sure it will do as it says. Although it's not soft and cushy, it does the job and should extend the time to have our septic tank drained. It is probably more economical than many tps and you don't have to change the roll as often."
3,Scott Rapid Dissolve Toilet Paper,"This toilet paper seems to be very similar to the Scott 1000 that we had previously bought. It does dissolve a few seconds faster than the Scott 1000, but other than that seems to be the very same. I could not locate this toilet paper at my local stores, so I called someone who works for Kimberly Clark and they said it would be located in the automotive(or camping) section. I still cannot locate it so we are still using the Scott 1000. I am sure it would be an excellent paper if I were able to locate it without ordering it online."
2,Not worth buying online,"Yeah, the product is fine. But I bought them thinking it would save me a considerable amount of money compared with buying them at my local store. It didn't. So next time I'll just go to the store."
1,Dissolves Instantly,"Scott Rapid-Dissolving Bathroom Tissue, 1-Ply, Unscented, Case Pack, Five - 4 Roll Packs, 800 Sheets Each (20 Rolls)Unless you use a large amount of this toilet paper (eliminating any savings) it dissolves as you are using it, particularly inconvenient for the female of the species. The worst one-ply I have ever used.Go find the puppy paper,my kids love it and it is comfortable for the MommyCottonelle For Kids Toilet Paper, Prints, Case Pack, Four - 12 Roll Packs (48 Rolls)Perfect for toilet training too!"
2,Spend an extra few pennies and get eco T.P.,This stuff ain't worth it spend a few extra pennies and get Seventh Generation. Seventh Generation is stronger and dissolves better not to mention 7th generation is made from post consumer recycled paper
1,Not usefully at all.,I find that this product starts disolving before the use it was made for can be completed. I have used Scott products for years and this is not a good one.
4,Rapid-Dissolving Tissue Lives Up To It's Name,"Yes, it is rapid dissolving. Do not expect it to perform like a thick, plush tissue since it is 1-ply. It is much like the original scott. It will save our septic system, I'm sure!"
4,a fun read,"We bought this book on a lengthy trip to canada for my 10 year old who was already in love with the redwall series. One day I picked it up and started reading and was hooked. It's an imaginative story of woodland creatures. My son at first had trouble with weasels being the good guys, but as the book points out, there are good and bad in all creatures. It has the action little boys crave but with a gentler, kinder message. I plan to read it aloud to my sixth graders this year. I believe it will hold their attention well."
1,Incomplete and not authentic.,"This is not a finished work by Yogananda,nor an abridged version of the (much anticipated!) full work published in 2004 by his organization, Self Realization Fellowship.Those interested in the full depth of Yogananda's overwhelming masterpiece who would like a paperback version will have to wait a little bit longer!!!!"
4,Honeywell Room Heater,This is a nice small heater. It does everything that Honeywell says it does.The only trouble I had was pushing down the child protection button. It does take quite a bit of strength
1,Do not buy this,I bought this and turned it but in less than ten minutes of use I heard a pop and it was dead. It did produce decent heat but it won't last any reasonable amount of time.
4,to get moving,"great way to get started, And to Keep Moving. laid out well to inspire to begin and to continue the program. need the Book to go with it."
4,Nice stereo,"Arrived within days in perfect condition. Free shipping, of course. Does exactly as described-- plays all 3 record speeds, cassettes, CD's and AM-FM stereo radio. Plays all well. Speakers are marginal for anything but a small room, but we hooked up a pair of Sony SS-B1000 2-way bookshelf speakers to the Crosby auxiliary speaker outlet for much better music. These Sony's just happen to also be sold by Amazon for $49. Overall, we are now pleased with this Crosley CR83 Arlington Stack-O-Matic Oak. This unit would have been okay with its' own attached speakers, but now we can crank it up much louder without having to worry about damage to the much smaller Crosley speakers. Hope to get many years of listening enjoyment from this unit. Thanks, Amazon, for offering so many products at exceptional prices with combined excellent customer service. A winning experience."
4,Great album,I love this album....It wasnt that successful sales wise but if EMI had of properly promoted it ..it would have sold as well as Duran Duran 7 & The Ragged Tiger...There is some awesome tracks on this albumI do have 1 gripe thoughNo extended mixes were includedThey could have put Manitou extended mix on this....Also the remastering isnt that great but hey we have it on CD so buy this and support the artist.....
1,Just like the Anime GT,"I wasn't expecting much from this game since it was based on the ""We stole Akira Toriyama's characters to make a few bucks"" Anime. For a side scroller, this game has terrible graphics and controls. Throw this one away in the garbage."
5,Fantastic and full of fun,I really thought that this game is fantastic and when you unlock characters it's so fun.I really think that every DragonBallZ fan should have it. This game is very fun because once you've saved up enough Points you can unlock super cool things for example characters you can unlock very powerful characters. Any way I think that this game is full of fun and I know that If you buy this game you will enjoy it alot.
3,Great Game but could've came out with a Sequel!,"I think this game is cool but the big problem is that Atari said they where going to make a sequel to this game and they said no because due to the next-gen consoles like the XBOX 360, PlayStation3, Nintendo Wii, The PlayStation Portable, and the Nintendo DS! It just changes everything to companies like Nintendo, Atari, Microsoft, Sony, Capcom, and Sega for instince. But I think Atari could've been ashamed of themselves for abadoning a project like a sequel to this game because I've been hearing from EB Games, and Gamestop saying that Atari was trying to make a Sequel to this game. I give this game a 3 out of 5!"
4,pretty good,"From what I've heard this is a pretty good game and I want it.The game is kinda like DragonballZ Sagas.Oh yeah,Can somebody please tell me the controls in the game my email is nick_augustus@hotmail.com."
2,"Great Pictures, Inaccurate History","This book has a lot of great pictures, but there is no excuse for sloppy errors like this one:On p22, it states the USS Lexington (CV2) underwent an extensive upgrade in 1943-1944. On p23, it correctly states that CV2 went down in the Battle of the Coral Sea in 1942. They later correctly state that the Essex class carrier scheduled to be named Cabot was renamed Lexington (CV16), commissioned in 1943. The writer must have seen a picture of CV16 from 1944, seen that it looked different than CV2 and written that it was upgraded.Bad job. Go ahead and get the book if you want the pictures, but find another title as a companion to get accurate history."
5,Beautiful throughout!,"If anyone who loves aircrafts carriers gets the chance to buy this book, go for it! It's worth every penny. Great photos and text make this book a treasure to any naval enthusiasts library."
1,the stickers are not reusable!,"I think the title probably says it all. I got this before a long drive on a beach trip figuring that it would entertain my daughter for hours. unfortunately, once the stickers are on the page they are impossible to get off. and since the story is all about placing the stickers, once you put the stickers on the page it isn't as interesting as a regular maisy book. I love maisy, but I really wish I hadn't bought this. I would have been better off with the maisy goes on vacation book which has a better story that bears repeated rereadings.also, once you use the stickers you are left either with the empty sticker page in the middle of the book, or you have to remove it, which is very difficult to do without tearing the book."
5,Great substitute for earbuds,"If your like me, and earbuds irritate, or constantly fall out of your ears, then these are for you. Lightweight with good sound quality, and they match your iPod too!"
3,Decent headphones for the money,"What can I say? They perform with good sound reproduction, but it does not produce a lot of high volume, or bass extremes.I use them for listening to music on my computer, but would not use them outside/running.Great sound in quiet closed quarters."
3,Not Enough Route Markings,"Was told by a friend who purchased this book a couple of years ago that it was the map book to have to travel around Ireland. The book we got was 6 years old, and it does not have good markings for the routes. Another friend has a 6 year old AA Atlas of Ireland, and its' markings are so much better (2ond edition), so I have ordered a newer 5th edition of the AA Atlas. The book I bought covers everything, but it is hard to find the routes on main roads."
4,ATV's Everything you need to know,"This book would be great for someone who likes atvs or needs one but doesn't know much about them. If you read a few certain chapters you would be ready to go to a dealership and pick out the ATV you want and/or need. Its not the most detailed book because the author trys to span the entire spectrum of atvs in stead of just focusing on the stock atvs themselves. He really shows his expertice in many areas but neglects some other areas.Overall very good book for the ATV newbie or a seasoned rider who wants some new tips and ideas, or just to sit back and read about ATVs!Ordered Amazon at a good price with fast shipping again!"
3,great at first...then aggravating,I bought this a few months ago and loved it at first. I only have one cat and hes hardly a year old but pees a gallon every time. The bag will not even be full and the wheel will be almost impossible to turn becausec its got so much litter in it. so Ive had to cut the bag and take out that litter and tie a new knot in the same roll of bags. the rolls last me months don't get me wrong.. but the wheel gets so hard to turn after just a week of dumping litter in to it. other then that i love it. but Im now looking for something with no wheel.
3,Better odor control is worth any minor inconvenience,This product is great for odor control. I love it for its descrete compactness. I find replacing the bag cartrage to be difficult(if you're like me) for persons with disabilities.
5,LOVE IT!,"I love this item. After getting 2 more cats, adding to my one, I found that cleaning the litter box became a horrible chore! I had to clean it 2, sometimes 3 times a day to keep it clean and smelling good, and it was hectic to keep getting a plastic sack to put the cat feces in. The litter mate is awesome!! I have had it for about 3 weeks now, and emptied the bags once. im sure the one refill of bags will last me until the end of the month. not a bad investment of about 7 bucks a month for the refills!! Its worth every penny!!"
5,Another Great Release from Gismonti,"I don't know how he does it: another masterful album of wonderful compositions played by first rate musicians. Chief among them of course is Egberto himself on guitar and piano. This trio recording does not include the cello that graces the other recordings of this band i.e. ""Infancia"" but it's hardly missed. The bassist and the other guitarist/synth player on the CD are no slouches either. The music and playing are inspired, imaginative, moody, joyful, knotty at times but always superb.Highly recommended!"
4,great book so-so etext edition,"Nice introduction to Greco-Roman Mythology. Concise with just enough information. Enjoyable for those who what to get a basis in the Greco-Roman mythology. The e-text functions properly and you can change the font size without chasing the text clear out of view. Unfortunately, this e-edition does not show a link to the TOC in the go to window. If you go to the beginning and backspace you find an interactive TOC with usable links. Unfortunately, the link does not quite get you to the chapter you are looking for."
5,Great book.,"This was the first book on my kindle and I'm loving it. It holds explicit details about the Greek gods and more. It tells every little fact about them all. There origin, abilities, and what they control and lots more is included in it. I definitely recommend this book to all people that enjoys this subject."
4,Just the facts maam.,"Good information. Lays out the major gods, goddesses, major myths etc. but there is no real story telling her. That said, I only needed the facts so I was ok with that. Would love to find a good book of myths as literature."
2,LINK FOR AUDIOBOOK DOESN'T WORK :(,"The book must be an awesome subject, but i basically bought it because there's a link to download the audio version. I have tried any possible way to download it, but it DOESN'T OPEN THE FILE. I am very disappointed :("
2,get something better,Was not very happy with the book. To muchhistory of the gods and legends at the beginning. Was not written very well. Look for something better in your public library.
2,it was just plain awkward to read.,"i am a huge lover of greek myths and it was hard to read this, even though i only got the sample. i found it hard to figure out somtimes when something ended and started. i was half way through the story of zeus beating his father before i even relized it had started!"
2,none,well im a big fan of greek and roman mythology and i could barely get through the first couple of pages.
3,greece roman,i have started reading and find it interesting but not really easy light reading. i expect to finish reading this eventually.
5,Very Interesting,"For a free book it is very interesting, a little slow in the beginning, but insightful. I love Greek Mythology so if you do too it's a good read."
4,Interesting Book,"This is my first review, so I'll be first telling about the content of this book. This book is a complete history of Roman gods and the myths associated with them.The first one were Uranus and Gaea- the parents of all the gods. Later Giants and Titans came and after them Olympians. All share a common fate where son will dethrone his own father. This happened with Uranus being dethroned by his own son Titan Cronus and he also faced the same fate by his own son Zeus who later became King of Gods.Reading this book in Kindle-PC was a different experience. Author has used many Roman phrases which is difficult to understand. Also, author has used Aides in the place of Hades (Brother of Zeus and God of Underworld).Overall, this book has complete information about the legends and Gods of Ancient Romans and Greece.You should buy this if you are interested in Roman and Greece culture."
1,Bit disappointed,Its a buck - ok? Was hoping for actual stories to play over the speakers in my car via KINDLE. Its really more a facts guide to the Greek Celestial Beings. Zeus is represented by an eagle on a sceptor bla bla bla who has an affair with Ledo ... - I want to read (or listen to) the actual story - not a summary recount by some scientist.
2,myths and ledgends of ancient greece and rome,"the book does not excite, even though it has lots of details i found myself looking for something else to read"
2,Myths and Legends of Ancient Greece and Rome,"Enjoyable, however there are too many errors in the writing that make it rough to follow the story lines. I learned quite a bit from the comparisons of the Roman and Greek legends."
4,All around good book,The book from page one had me hooked. It was hard to put down I wanted to know what would happen next.
3,Lost Its Momentum.,"This book started out very interestng, but then started repeating itself. Repeated same stories, in a different manner and just seemed to dry up. I didn't finish it as it was just repeating itself after the first half of the book."
2,Myths and legends of ancient Greece and Rome,I chose. This book because I am interested in Greek mythology.I dislike it because it did not tell me much. It was just plain boring.
4,"Very Informative, Yet Lacking Specific Details and Other Relations","This helped quite a bit, I'm still reading it, due to my love for Greek Mythology. I love the fact that this informative book was free too. However, there are some areas that seem a little hastily done, such as the sections with the Muses, that I would've loved to learn more about."
2,Cut a third of the book...,"...and all of the clutter on the floor could be dialogue... and it would be a more interesting book. Even so, I finished it because I was sick, not because it was gripping. The author doesn't write badly, but I think she tried to pack in too much for the plot to flow well or the characters to appear plausible."
4,"A Good book, But some mixed feelings","Charles and Melanie Fraser seem like a couple that has it all. A good life. Two children that they love. In a sense the perfect life, until six year old Colin is kidnapped. Now the past is coming back to haunt both of them. With time running out Charles and Melanie must race to find a ring and save Colin before its to late.""Daughter of the Game"" was the first book that I read by Tracy Grant. While I did enjoy it. There were time that the seem to be too long and to many plots happening. Overall, it was a decent book and I would read is follow up book."
1,Disappointed,"I bought this book in a moment of weakness because I needed something to read on a trip to Ireland. What a struggle, both to read and not to discard. The story line was a 19th century version of a Super Mario game in which Charles and Melanie Fraser wandered all about London looking for gold ring that would get their son, Colin, back. At every turn, things get more convoluted and contrived: ... Gimme a break, please. Aside from all of the tapestry and the score card you need to keep track of everyone, you know how the books going to end before you've read 20 pages. My mistake. I should have doen my homework before buying it."
1,Terribly unrealistic,"I actually purchased all 3 books in this trilogy BEFORE reading the first one. Being an avid horse lover & owner of an ex-racehorse, I was excited to get them. However, the store is completely unrealistic and obviously written by someone who truely knows nothing about horses or racing. Continuously repetitive and boringly ""perfect"" characters who always win and don't seem to have much for negatives in their lives. The negatives they do face they use their outragous fortunes to buy out of. I never can seem to put a book down though, always hoping it will get better, but this one didn't. I eventually went to just skimming the pages, since it's all repetitive anyhow. I'm working on finishing the final book in the series (which isn't any better) and then I doubt I'll look to this author again."
4,Good Read,"I normally do not read this type of story. Having said that, I was pleasantly surprised at how it kept me captivated and at times a real page turner to get to the conclusions of action scenario's. I would recommend this book for good action, story plot and the ability to place myself in the book through character identification."
5,Kentucky Heat,I love Fern Michaels writing and I think her series on Kentucky are really intertainning. I would rather read a collection of series rather than just single books and this is just one of nine books on these families. They take you from WW11 to the present time.
5,Functional and stylish hat,"I bought this hat for my son for camping and fishing trips with his Dad. He loves it.m has a zip compartment for keeping money or key safe. Nice hat, now my husband wants one."
5,Drawing Assignments that are Interesting and Challenging,"I bought this book for myself to motivate myself to draw. Would be a great resource for the college level art teacher, as well as high school level."
5,The Briki,"The quality wa exceptional considering I have ordered Brikis from Greece and Turkey. Works well, does the job, great taste as you learn to make great Greek/Turkish Coffee."
1,Where is it?,I ordered the product on May 20th 2008 it is now June 20th 2008 and I still have not recieved my product.
5,Page-Turner,"i have read everyone of Philip Margolin's books and Heartstone was the first one that i read. this book is a MUST-READ. I read the whole thing in about 3 hours, i could not put it down once i started.The ending that you thought would be by the middle of the book takes a different turn TWICE, making you say ""What the Hell"", but its awesome.this book is worth it."
2,first Margolin book I didn't like,Interesting story but to much sex that didn't add anything to story.Author tends to put detailed sex in every book but this one seemed to go overboard.
4,Excellent,execellent for any one who likes murder mystery's. Highy recommended for any one who likes to read and read quickly.
2,heartstone,"This book did not capture me the way Margolin's other books have.I read all of his books and this was my least favorite. I did not like the characters and the plot was not up to Margolin standards.I had just read Capitol Murder, After Dark, and The Burning Man.....I would not recommend this book."
4,HEARTSTONE,Phillip Margolin is one of my new (to me ) favorite authors. I'm getting caught up on all the back and new books. Waiting for the next one out.
3,Good But not Great !,"After recently reading Margolin's ""The Burning Man"" I couldn't wait to get my hands on another of this author's titles. This one, ""Heartstone"" was a good read but did not compare to the last piece I read. This was not a page turner nor was it a book that I just couldn't put down, to the contrary, it was a book that I sometimes had to force myself to pick up. The story was good and at certain points, like when one of the main characters, Esther Pegalosi, was under hypnosis to recall the details of a murder that she witnessed, did the story get interesting. Overall, a good story but not one that captivated my interest. I will read another title or two by this author in hopes of finding another title that competes with my initial read by this author."
4,interesting and addicting---but confusing.,"I enjoyed reading this book. It is a bit confusing though because it hops around from subject to subject, but this sudden change of subject keeps you addicted and interested in what will happen next. This book is great for those who like mysteries. I recommend this book to those out there and hope that you will enjoy it as much as I did. In my opinion you won't be able to put it down!!!"
4,As a debut novel - It's a commendable read.,"After enjoying ""After Dark"", I decided to read Phillip Margolin's debut novel, which was first published in 1978 and being nominated for an Edgar Award.Thumbs up for being a debut and written in the late 70s, it may not be as sophisticated and compelling as compared with those more recent works of some legal/criminal/thriller writers.Nonetheless, it is a sincere and good effort work from PM. This could attribute to PM himself being a criminal defense lawyer in Oregon where he works both as an appellate and a trial attorney. As quoted from the book, he has represented over 30 people charged with murder, including a number of clients who have faced the death penalty.What I admire about PM's novel is that, just like ""After Dark"", he has invoked or should I say,at least he tried (especially for those who donot favour this book), to instil some thought provoking 'dark' facts for us to ponder seriously!!"
4,I stayed up late to finish it.,"I rarely become so engrossed in a book that I can't get to bed, yet Heartstone kept me up until I finished. This is a tremendous effort for a first novel. I loved the characters, we all know someone in here. Just one question- when is the sequel?"
2,Not close to Margolin's others,"Too many characters, moves to slowly, and the little twist at the end isn't worth the time it takes to get there. But don't let that stop you from reading Margolin's other great books ""Gone But Not Forgotten"", ""Last Innocent Man"", and ""Wild Justice"""
4,Surprize ending.,"I have never read any other books by Phillip Margolin but I liked this book. It takes a look at the legal system and the lost memories of people. How witnesses can be turned to ""remember"" events that never occured. This novel reads more like a true crime novel with all the plots, twists and turns. It sounds like Margolin got the idea from this novel from an old retired cop. Just when you think the novel is over and your sympathies are all lined up, there is a death bed confession with a surprise ending. Keeps you guessing until the very end."
2,Underwhelmed by this first effort,"It's nice to hear the other reviewers lauding Margolin's other books because this book left me pretty flat. Indeed, I am wondering what the fuss is about this author -- but I'll give him another try -- someday.So what's wrong (or right) about this book? Basically, I realized about half way into the book that I really didn't like any of the the characters. Part of the problem is that there are way too many characters so there's no chance to develop a sympathetic protagonist (or even a crook). The book also bounces around between all of these people and lacks any sense of flow."
2,They can't all be great,"In a fast trip through previous Margolin books, Hearstone was the first one that I found lacking. The characters were not as well developed as they are in other Margolin books and the plot took too long to get anywhere. If this is your first one, keep reading. Gone But Not Forgotten and The Last Innocent Man were much better."
2,I didn't like this one,"This one was difficult to get through, although it was a good plot and I've enjoyed others of his books. But there were just too many disconnected characters introduced early in the book and not resolved until much later. A hundred pages into the book, I was so confused that I had to go back and re-read from the beginning to keep track of all of the characters. At no point did this book really grip me in a can't-put-it-down way, and the hypnosis sessions dragged on forever."
3,Not his best work,"I just finished Heartstone and must say I found it a little too confusing to be enjoyable. There seemed to be far too many characters, too many to be able to pin down one to be interested in and identify with. Although the premise is certainly interesting, and the conclusion a bit of a surprise, I found myself not feeling much of anything by the end, except a relief that I wouldn't have to spend more time being puzzled by another vaguely familiar character name.Gone But Not Forgotten is a much better read. If you enjoy gory suspense, try Headhunter by Michael Slade - now that is a page-turner with a great ending!"
2,I was very disappointed!!,"The first book I read by Mr. Margolin was Gone but Not Forgotten. Perhaps that was my mistake. Gone... was a fabulous book. I would rank it with my top 10 favorite books. (I will write a review for it as well to be fair.) I couldn't wait to read another book by this author. I made the grievous error of picking up Heartstone. I would rank it with my top 10 least favorite books of all time. Now, I'm afraid to pick up another of his books. I want the thrill of Gone... but if I wanted to be put to sleep by a book I would read a nursery rhyme. Little Red Riding Hood had more suspense."
2,NOT TO GOOD!!!!!,"Wish there was some way to get your money back when you did not like a book. The author has already made his by that time. I think Hearstone has to many characters and to many different stories going on at the same time. I was totally confused. The story is about who killed Richie Walters and Elaine Murray. Wasit the Collidge brothers, Bobby and Billy or not? Was the key witness told what to say? What about the prisoners who said they knew something. Of course the detective will do what ever to solve the case. The DA is looking out for him self and his future even if he holds back the truth. The last few pages of the trail were very good. The rest was not. I think the best thing I got was a line on page seven, ""Getting into heaven was not going to depend on the size of his waistline."" This is my second Margolin book may try another but doubtful."
2,Not really that great...,"The book itself sounded interesting, but after I've started reading it, things started to get confusing. Too many characters appeared all at once, and half-way the book I couldn't understand what was going on at all. At one moment, I was reading about character X, and suddenly the story was shifted to character Y. The ending was rather sudden, yet surprising."
2,Terrible Abridgement...,"The soundtrack was IMHO really the only appealing thing about this. Marc is an excellent interpretationist, however, Random House gave him little to really work with regarding this abridgment. For instance they cut the entire scene with Jacen and Ben in the munitions tower in the opening. They cut some of the dialog between Han and Leia prior to the entry of the family and friends. Basically they were opting for the action and drama and left the light moments by the wayside. As well as some critical plot points."
2,ripped off,"The trumpet was really beautiful when it arrived. We had trouble playing it due to sticking valves. Having played for 50 years, we tried to oil them to no avail. We got permission to return the horn, which we did. All this happened in August and we are still waiting for our refund in mid December..."
1,This is just... horrible,"There is a trumpet player in my school's band that has one of these, and it is just HORRIBLE. It is never in tune, she is easily at the level of lead trumpet, but due to this horrible ""instrument"", is playing 3rd trumpet, and is seated last in the section. This is a horrible piece of metal suitable only for a lamp. If I could give this a negative rating, I would. Also, the saxes they make are c**p, an i am saying this from personal experience."
5,perfect for using with plastic sheets!,I needed to separate sections in my portfolio. I used plastic sheets so regular dividers were too small. These work great! I was able to see each numbered section clearly. My portfolio looked neat and organized!
1,no color choice...,I am really disappointed with the color options for extra wide dividers. I don't like the blaring colors and would much more prefer the trendy neutral and pastel choices (of every other product out there EXCEPT extra wide dividers...). It's really frustrating that avery and other brands have not caught on to what the trends are... please fix!!!!!
2,Not ready for prime time,"I think maybe this thing was designed by engineering school dropouts. If the treadmill is too close to the wall, you can't turn it on/off because of the shockingly inconvenient placement of the switch (which is hard to reach under any conditions because it's hidden behind the power plug). And it's ALWAYS too close to the wall because the treadmill travels while you use it -- you can scooch it away from the wall, but it will soon be back where it started (and leaving black smudges on your wall as it moves up and down the incline).The price is good, but do yourself a favor and pay a little extra for professional engineering."
2,Poor weld,"When rolling myT51 down the stairs to my basement the handle bars broke from the up rights. Upon inspection, the brackets were only welded 3/16 of a inch instead of 1 1/2 inches. Being the second owner, I had no warrenty."
5,"""The"" Book for Aging and Judging Trophy Whitetails","Aging and Judging Trophy Whitetails is the ultimate resource for every whitetail enthusiast. The book is loaded with photos (almost 300 color photographs) taken by esteemed wildlife photographers, and is a teaching tool to age and judge trophy whitetails in the field. It also includes a self test to see how well you have learned the skills expertly taught in the text. A must have!!"
5,Loved this book.,This book is to be read and re-read. It has many layers and is very honest. It deals with issues we all face and questions we all ask ourselves (and God). Great insight for peacemakers.
4,a good introduction to Spiritual life,"Nouwen describes the Spiritual life like a dance with three movements, distinct but interconnected. I found part 2 (the movement from hostility to hospitality) particularly valuable--it's a must read for parents, educators, and people in the helping professions."
4,Fan of the DCU? Go ahead and buy this.,"Picks up right where Quiver left off. GA and GA Junior are still getting to know each other. Black Canary and Ollie are defining their relationship, and young Mia wants desperately to be part of the Arrow family. Throw in the homicidal villain Onomatopoeia, and you've got fantastic entertainment! This guy is a ruthless stalker of heroes.As with Quiver, Phil Hester's pencils and Ande Parks' colors are awesome. I do think the brighter inks in Quiver were a bit better, but Hester's no slouch in these issues. The art has a timeless feel. Could've been drawn yesterday or 15 years ago."
3,Not as fascinating as the first volume but still readable,"Lots of trademark Ollie Queen cynicism, lots of action, but not quite up to Kevin Smith's earlier volume. Not quite as R-rated, either, which is good for the younger fans. Green Arrow's always a lot of fun!"
3,disappointed,"I am a R-K freak. I love his operas, he's an opera guy! His chamber music is weak, he said so in his book ""my musical life"", he manages better big orchestras...you'll have always the feeling that there is something missing.Martin"
5,Great book!,Awesome pictures. I pick up this book and open it whenever I need to feel some dog love. Highly recommended as a coffee table book - everyone loves it!
5,Best Golden Retriever Book So Far,"This is a pictorial history of the author's love affair with her Golden Retrievers. The ""story"" is about 30 pages and the pictures about 50 or so. The story will grab you in your gut and hit you right in the heart of how you feel about your current (or former) Golden Retriever. The story about the cover photo is especially moving. For a non ""how-to"" book, this one is THE BEST!"
2,"""2Pac Live"" Review","Death Row Records is at again with yet another release by the late Tupac Shakur. Following up the awful remix album, ""Nu-Mixx Klassics"", they couldn't do much worse but that doesn't really say much. This live album is supposed to be from Pac's performance at the House Of Blues but anyone expecting to hear Pac's infamous declaration of war against Biggie from that performance should know that it hasn't been included. Also, the opening track is actually a medley from his perfomance on Saturday Night Live in 1995. One of the tracks is falsely advertised as ""Heartz Of Men"" when it is actually just a seven-second interlude. All of this might not have mattered if ""Live"" were a quality attempt to bring a live Pac concert to our speakers but in the end, the audio quality is just slightly better than a bad bootleg recording. Clocking in at under 45 minutes, ""2Pac Live"" may leave most Pac fans feeling a bit short-changed."
1,Bootleg Garbage,"Do not buy this album. It is trash. If you want a 2pac live album buy Live at the House of Blues. Both albums are from the same concert, however this one (suge knight/deathrow's version) is horrible, and i mean horrible, quality. It is an audience recorded bootleg. Meaning someone was in the audience with a tape recorder and recorded the concert, and deathrow put it on a cd and tried to sell it as a live album. Live at H.O.B. however is the same concert, except much, much better quality. The recordings actually came from the front of house mixboard for that album."
3,2pac Live- Bootleg quality.Live album.,"not really that good, the songs are , but short, bootleg quality and just thrown on to make more money as always with the ever always coming out releases. it's a pass, unless like me you saw it and it's live and you wanted to have it."
1,Poor Sound,"2pac's production perfection is one of the many attributes which helped establish his sound and respect. He surely wouldn't have approved of this novice sounding recording. It is impossible to judge the concert from a crowds perspective,purely because of the rubbish recording. Was 2pac on fire? who knows. The backing vocals and beats are higher on the mix than 2pac himself. He sounds like he's in the bathroom backstage. Deathrow had to be aware of the poor recording and still decided to release. Why?. For the money?. Even so why not release something more professional, it must exist. This is a amateur sounding release expected from a crowd recorded bootleg. Unless you are a hardcore 2pac fan looking for some kind of artifact rather than a pleasurable listening experience, hold on to your money."
1,dont buy,"i thought to myself as i listened..""suge knight should get knocked out for selling this horrible audio quality cd"". ha, i got my wish. this is a terrible reprsentation of pac live. dont waste a cent"
3,Pretty Good but needs a DVD,This CD is aight but it wouldv'e been worth it to have a DVD of the concert then it would've gotten 5 stars
4,"short, but worth the money","If you're a 2Pac fan, you definitely need this CD. If you're not a huge fan, stick with the stuff he recorded in the studio. My only complaints are that the CD is short (13 tracks and most only have 2Pac's verse) and the sound quality isn't great in some parts. That isn't a fault with the CD, but a fault with the sound system when he performed these songs. There are a few spots where the mic sqeaks.It's cool to hear Pac live though. He's just as good as he is in the studio. That's not surprising though, because I heard he rarely did more than one take when recording a song. Also cool are the few songs that were unreleased at the time of this show (troublesome, tattoo tears, and never call you [...] again).This CD is worth the money, but I'll be disappointed if this is his only live performance that was recorded. I hope there's more out there...maybe even some video for a concert DVD!"
3,Live isn't the greatest,"Picked up this CD last week and was a little disappointed with it. The performance was good but the sound quality on the CD is poor. It sounds like an audience member taped the performance. Also track 8 - Heartz of men, is only seven seconds. Overall at $13.99 it's not a terrible buy. It is 2PAC. But they should have done something to improve the sound quality."
1,"Poor quality, only for Tupac completists","I don't really know what this live album is supposed to accomplish, but I believe it has failed on all accounts. I enjoy having a live Tupac document, but the replay value is almost nil, as the sound quality is terrible.All in all, I was fairly disappointed with this release."
4,soundtrack for the downtroden,"First and foremost, will haven are my favourite band so i'm slightly biased by my opinion, however its been at least a month since this album has been released and its leaft me confused, i should by rights LOVE it, it really delivers everything i want in a will haven album, but it hasn't knocked me off my feet like everything that they've released before. this is not to say its a bad album, if i knew nothing about them before last month it would still be my album of the year (just beating the new les savy fav album), they are a great band, this is a very innovative, fresh sounding record that puts the ridiculously overrated last deftones record to shame. i guess i'm just greedy and i expected more - really it just consists of 9 songs. its a good, solid album, they are a great live band and they are super nice people. think about it like this.. every time someone buys this album, godsmack die just a little bit - please send will haven multi platinum?!"
3,O.K.,"I have heard really great things about this, but when I listened to it, I found it to be lackluster. Not bad, not good."
5,Get out and do something!,"This book is great. As soon as I started reading it, I knew I had to get out and do some hiking with my family. The authors enthusiasm for life is contagious and inspired me to value every experience. I also enjoyed the variety of content in the book, from humours poems to thrilling accounts of rafting the Colorado river through the Grand Canyon."
4,Good Book,"pros:1. Good descriptions of the patterns.2. Good explanation of how to use the patterns to solve a particular problem.Cons:I wished the examples were better. Most people are not familiar with CAD systems, so a more common software problem would have been more helpful."
4,Love this stuff!,"This is magic in a bottle. The smell is intoxicating - spicy cloves, honey, and lavender. The texture is very creamy and rich, and it really feeds moisture to dry curly hair. Leave it in your curls for at least 10 minutes for maximum effect. Also good for calming a flaky scalp - I massage a palmful into my roots and it keeps flakes away for 2-3 days. The only con is that a little bit does NOT go a long way, so there's less bang for your buck."
5,Donovan's Daughter is a must-have book.,"I read a library copy of ""Donovan's Daughter"" and so thoroughly enjoyed it, that I now have a copy on order. I want to own this series from the very beginning.Lexy Connor is a great heroine. She is well past the first blush of youth, but is smart, vital and ready to do anything for a friend.She searches for the true parentage of Tally, a young woman who is being threatened even though she knows nothing of her true background. Her parents have been dead for years. She comes to Lexy because Lexy knew her adoptive parents.With few clues to go on, Lexy (along with her delightful dog) goes across country to solve a mystery that puts her and some of her friends in grave danger.Don't miss this exciting and humorous first mystery with an unforgettable heroine."
1,No support,"This product was shipped without proper packaging. They used the original product box to send this heavy system. The box was very beaten up when it arrived. And judging from the noise that it makes when I move it, there were loose parts inside. Not safe for a unit that handles power. I called Panamax to let them know about the packaging issue and was told that purchases from Amazon are not under warranty. I called the Amazon seller for a refund, they calim that it was a manufactuering defect that happens from time to time. When has the poor packaging and loose part become manufactuering defect?I have to pay for the shipping both way to get the refund. An awful experience."
4,"""When Heaven Fell"" meets ""The Forever War""","This a typical Barton novel. Mercenaries and kinky alien sex, but with a conscience, as only Barton can write. I personally liked When Heaven Fell better. Don't get me wrong- I think William Barton is one of the finest science fiction writers publishing today. This novel is definitely worth reading and far better than most of the stuff published today, but in many ways this novel rehashes When Heaven Fell without the neat story line in When Heaven Fell."
3,Tiresome and affected,"Somewhere about halfway through this book became a real slog for me. The author's stylistic use of brief sentence fragments really started to get distracting and seemed to be a cover-up for lack of substance. Also, despite the passage of many years the narrator never seemed to evolve beyond callow."
4,Very pleased,"I use this mask for scuba, against the recommendations. It is so comfortable I don't know I have it on. Clarity is excellent as is field of vision. No it is not very stout and you have to hang on to your snorkel when you jump in from the boat as the strap is minimal (I had to chase my snorkel the first time I used it when it fell off and headed for the bottom). As for scratching the lenses, for the low cost and great comfort, if it gets that bad I'll throw it away and buy another. Store it in the case it comes with (which is way too big and takes up a lot of room in your dive bag) and scratching shouldn't be a problem. I have had at least six different quality and expensive masks and I like this one the best hands down. I didn't buy this on Amazon. The last $100 poorly fitting mask I bought online and paid the price of not fitting it in a shop before I made my purchase, not Amazons fault but try before you buy, you may save yourself a bundle."
4,Perfect for freediving!,"Excellent view, very small, reduced air space, perfect for freediving or spearfishing! The only disadvantage is that is not glass but plastic, so you have to be very careful to keep it all the time in his origial boxGreat product!"
3,Below Aqua Sphere's Standards,"I had high hope for this mask.I've used and reviewed Aqua Sphere Kayenne goggle and gave it a raving 5-star review. I expected that same level of product here. Sadly, these just arn't as good.This fit is okay, but:The flimsy strap doesn't play well with snorkels.The lenses are plastic, which isn't always a bad thing, but on a mask I have a higher standard for clarity than I do with goggles. When I snorkel, I want to see very clearly (otherwise, what's the point?).The side skirt leaks on the snorkel side.Something about the nose pocket causes me to get water up my nose.In fact, this mask merits the third star only because it's so light.I'm still looking for a great low-volume mask--this isn't it."
4,Good Devotional,"It is what it says in the title, the gospels in chronological order. For a new christian, like myself, it is nice to have Jesus' ministry and life laid out in order. The devotions for each day are wonderful and eye opening"
5,Life Changing,"I used this book devotionally and found it to be challeging and life changing. I've since purchased several copies for friends. Smith's commentary is brief and helpful in following the flow of events. The very best part is that Scripture remains central unlike some ""devotional"" works these that use a verse or two along with stories, illustrations, etc. I came came away from this book feeling like I truly spent 30 days with Jesus. I was pumped up!"
1,badly reproduced cd,I spent a lot for what I expected to be a high quality CD and man was I disappointed. Some songs seem to play faster than normal - just a little. It has a tinny quality - not enough bass. And they cut the end off of too many songs on the tracks - like radio does. This is terrible for the price. I would recommend no one buy this. I'm tossing it and buying a cheaper version.
2,Protects well,"This case protects your Sansa well, but isn't pretty and doesn't work well for wearing on your arm or belt."
4,Not a bad holder...,"I like this alot for my Sansa e260. Once it the Flexiskin is on, it is still easy to move around on my Sansa. In fact, it makes the buttons easier to work since the Flexiskin brings the buttons up even with the roll wheel. I would rate this a 5, but the arm band seems a little bit small. I am an average guy, and I only have about 2 inches of extra strap left when it is on my arm. I don't tighten it as tight as it will go, but you would think there would be just a little bit more armband. I haven't tried the belt clip that comes with this, but it appears easy to use."
1,This book Stinks,If you want to read one of the most pretentious books on progressive rock whereby the writers try to sound smart discussing a wide range of social philosophers completely out of context then this book is for you. I would recommend not wasting your hard earned mony and picking up a classic like Armando Gallo's I Know What I Like or Sid Smith's Court of the King Crimson. Both amazingly enjoyable and unpretentious reads.
4,Easy-to-use and entertaining,Anyone who has ever cooked venison will love this book. The recipes are easy to follow and taste great. Learning how the author got her kids to eat venison was great.
1,Really Bad,This is probably the worst cd of prison songs I have ever heard. This guy couldn't carry a tune if his life depended on it. Save your money!
3,"One of many suspense novels, but not a stand-out","I don't often read a Johansen novel, in fact I think I've read two, but both have been pretty interesting and decent reads. That being said, Long After Midnight was a pretty good book. It wasn't the best suspense novel I've read this year, nor was it the worst. I think the main thing that sticks out about this book for me, since I read it two months ago, was just that the characters were very likeable and the plot was intriguing enough that you wanted to keep reading to see what was going to happen. At times it moved fast, other parts seemed to drag a bit, but over all it was a good book. I might pick up another of her books, we'll see."
3,It was okay....,"I have enjoyed Iris Johansen in the past, but I had a really hard time getting into this book. I couldn't get into the characters. Especially Kate...she just didn't make me sensitive to her plight. I did like Noah and Seth, but still I don't think there was enough characther development. I never felt the chemistry between Kate and Seth, or even Noah.The actual plot was okay, but nothing that really held my interest.I do still like Iris Johansen and will continue to read her, but I was a little disappointed with this one."
4,Excellent and Enjoyable!,I loved this book! I never read this author's work before but I will now. I really enjoyed just about every page. I totally loved the guy the main character fell in love with. I was really pleased with the ending. However the only criticism I have is that the main character was sort of annoying. Her sarcasm was not becoming and she did a few stupid things throughout the book. It's definitely worth it though cause the book is spectacular!
2,Not impressed with kate,"The character of Kate grated on my nerves! In spite of all that had happened showing the law couldn't help her, she was naive enough to think ""the system will work"". Seth is a man who is an absolute expert at keeping people safe, a man who would never back down. Yet she fights him at every turn. ""You can't tell me what to do"" or ""I'll do what I want"". She needs to remember she has a family to protect and stop acting like a willful child!"
2,Awful Waste of Time,"This is the first book by Johansen that I've read, and it will be the last. This has a disappointingly ridiculous plot, with characters that are extremely annoying. They are forever doing the least prudent thing in any situation. A killer is after them, but they go about exposing themselves to danger at every turn. The main female is a nasty tempered nag. That two men would find her attractive is baffling. I wanted to stop reading half way through, but I hate giving up on a book. I finished it and am glad it's over."
2,Like all the rest,"I thought this book was ok. They all seem to be the same though. The author never really does anything new, it is almost like you are reading the same book over and over with different characters. I would recommend reading ""The Ugly Ducking"" and then moving on to another author."
2,Not that great,"The book had some exciting moments...but it was way too complicated for me. The characters seemed two-dimensional, and the plot kept jumping around. I think the book would have been a lot better, and certainly more suspenceful, if it had stuck with just two alternating viewpoints, Kate Denby's and Ishmaru's, who is the madman assigned to kill her. Ishmaru was a very interesting villian...he would have been great in a John Sandford book."
5,Excellent end,You'll get hooked since the first page and you wouldn't be able to put it down till you finish it. All the time you'll think that Kate is kind of ruthless. But at the unexpected end you'll see all the truth about her and her heart. Six stars for IJ.
3,SLOW BUT NOT IMPOSSIBLE!!,"I swear everytime I finish one of her books that I'm not going to read another one; yet when I see a new one, I pick it up. As with her other books, this book never quite takes flight. You can almost see it hobbling down the run-way waiting for the ""fly"" signal...some books eventually fly and others just keep hobbling...this was one of those hobbling books.I'm not sure what the problem is. The characters are likeable but may need to bo ""punched up"" a little. Everything feels dark and foreboding in this book.Maybe I keep reading because I do see so much potential. But, while I am certainly no author, I think that maybe giving these folks a little lightness and showing their positive human traits, there is a story worth both reading and writing."
2,"Silly characters, not easy to follow plot","I'm struggling to get through this book now, although I'm not sure why I just don't put it down. The kid, Joshua, drives me nuts; a totally unbelievable personality and comments from him. Kate is supposed to be this strong woman, but she usually has no idea what to do, easily is bullied and manipulated, and sappy. I guess I just don't like the author's style (sort of a blend of Barbara Cartland, Danielle Steele, and Sidney Sheldon), so will avoid her books in the future."
4,Beach Novel,A good book to read on in your spare time. Its one of those romantic thrillers. I started reading a few of her books when I realize they were really a series but I could never figure out which order they came in so I pick them up when I see them. Its a decent book to read and keep you occupied.
4,"way to cool, specially the romance between the protagonists","i like it a lot because it was kind of different. also because it shows a part of women that a lot of people don't know. It shows how can women overcome fear barriers and obtain victory by their own effort. way to go, Iris!!!!!"
4,I loved this book!,"This is the third book that I have read by Johansen and I think it was my 2nd favorite. I love her writing, it always keeps me thinking. I couldn't put any of her books down. The reason I only give it 4 stars is because I wasn't to impressed with the end. I wanted to read about the wedding. I wanted to know what happened with RU2 and if it was allowed in the states. I was curious as to if it helped Kate's father. I really wish there were a sequal to this one."
3,WHAT HAPPENED TO CLIMAX?,"This book was really good. It had me considering ways in which the characters were going to ""get rid of"" the bad guy, but the ending really let me down. There was no swinging-up to a big climax. That's why I gave it only 3 stars. Most times the ending can either make or break a story. This one just shot it right down."
3,So similar with Ugly Duckling and And Then You Die,"After reading the other 2 I mentioned, this was just not so exciting and nerve racking.In all fairness, I think it is a good read and a reviewer mentioned about how unrealistic it is that Kate Denby is 29 and has all these degrees, well it is all explained in page 8."
3,May've been better if I'd read it and avoided abridged!,I had a really hard time connecting with the plot when I listened to the abridged version. I would NOT recommend it. I'm going to try reading it and see if it gets any better. Was upset that Noah died as well. I also thought Kate was a little annoying I would have let him kill Ishmaru. She should really feel responsible for all those other deaths.
5,This is her best!,"I have only read 3 of Johansen's books but I would rank this one the best. It was so inspirational to me. I have the greatest interest in joining CIA now. I have always wanted to do spying and such and this totally motivated me. I couldn't put this book down. The characters were described so well that I felt as if I knew them. Johansen's mix of mystery, suspense, action and romance is incredible. I found that television was no longer interesting to me. This book played out in my mind. If I were to suggest any book in the whole world for someone to read it would be this one. The end of this one was satisfying. I would love to have it go on but I was satisfied with the end. I didn't HAVE to know more. READ IT!!!"
1,Unintriguing ScienceGoneWrong Story With Boring Protagonist,"Much of this book has our ""heroine"" gazing down at her son fondly & thinking ""Oh, Joshua"", with which we're supposed to be touched or possibly relate. She had all the punch and complexity of June Cleaver at Sunday services. The male characters were comprised of pure ethnicist cliche, and of course they were all impressed with our 2-d ""heroine's"" good looks. So in essence the plot goes like this: a vapid and attractive widowed mother gets embroiled in some shady technology drama which her husband had been involved in. She helplessly shrieks and maternally frets for her son and falls in love with the good guy, so predictably that I wanted to cry for the trees that needlessly died to make this MadeForTVMovie style of a novel. Definitely one of the lamest piles of pulp I've yet encountered."
2,Buyer Beware Mistakes & lack of Exercise Solutions,"Just a quick review to warn people like me who buy books like these to help us in our autodidact pursuits. I bought this Dover book because I trusted Dover publications and am now disappointed to say that this trust is now in question. The book has some merit: the flow and examples are clear and well laid out however, THERE ARE NO SOLUTIONS TO THE EXERCISES!Be aware that there are some glaring mistakes even to the beginner's eyes. For example, the author says ""We may determine a 4X4 matrix..."" and then represents this 4x4 with a 5x5 matrix. And he contradicts a commutivity theorem by saying that where two matrices A and zero share the same nxn row & column dimensions An+0n=A and then right after this he says A+0=0 on pp. 12-13. This is wrong! How am I supposed to trust further examples from this book? Sorry, I'll have to permanently shelve it...Good luck.IndiAndyAspiring Autodidact"
5,A Treasure of Folk Art and Inspirational Nostalgia,"This book is an extraordinary find. It came into my possession around 1990, when my artsy aunt was purging her book collection. I confiscated her copy from the trash and consider this book among my prized possessions.Native Flash and Funk captures images and stories of truly creative and talented artisans and crafters.Truly, you MUST look at the images to appreciate the artistic skills of these artists. I have a great attraction to the wood-carved doors, if I could find one, I would very quickly save the money and have one installed! Secondly I am in awe of the embroidered shirt (a young woman created the shirt while serving time in prison, the nuns taught her to embroider and she became a true visionary with skill). Not to mention the beautiful batik clothing, and touching stories. (okay, so the penny kamode did make me giggle...)This book is a valuable piece of history that highlights the creative flow of the Haight-Ashbury era."
5,A Norman Vincent Peale for the '90s,"Crawford brings a refreshing new ""bounce"" to positive thinking, taking it a step further (higher?) by remodeling it as ""resilient"" thinking. Excellent. Inspiring. A keeper!"
5,Great Characters,"I loved this book. It was the second book I read by this author, and I was amazed at how well she could create characters so close to me in attitudes and likes. I love working on cars, and I have experienced the prejudice that comes with that as a female. I was fascinated at the author's ability to create a believable character within this premise. Yeah, if you are a true mechanic, you may find a few flaws in some of the repairs. Still, most of the information was impressively accurate. I picked up this series thinking it was going to be cheesy, but I found some books I could really sink my teeth into."
2,Appearances can be deceiving,"Looks aren't everything. A rich, beautiful woman becomes a small town mechanic in this romance novel. She's totally helpless, which goes against most of what we know about rich people: they have money because they can do things (or sell things) better than others. However, she is a decent accountant and mechanic and she slowly falls for her employer, Bob. There's some witty dialogue between Bob and Georgette concerning food and fixing up a home. The moral of the story is don't judge by appearances."
4,Good Hard Rock Sound,"This album by Decyfer Down is a bit hard for my taste, but it is rather well done.At times the tracks seem a bit too similar, but they have a good sound. The lyrics are nothing that will cause a concern for parents. Some of the songs have subtle Christian messages and all are rather positive.Hard rock fans will enjoy this much more than I do, but even I will concede that it is pretty good. If a potential listener wants to try a digital version before buying the whole CD, my recommendation would be 'Fight Like This', which I think is the best one on the album."
3,Decent but needs some work,It's decent music definately professional but It needs some work to break the monotony and bring out more colors in the songs. I wouldn't recommend this one just yet but perhaps the next one will be better.
3,should i?,when i listed to life again this song with my dad he said he thought i would never like this kind ofmusic! gess i did. i might wait till another song by these guys is played on the radio till i buy it.
5,I can't wait for these guys next CD,"This album has ten songs and all that have hooks that grab you and pull you in. Heavy guitars and a lead singer with a great voice who puts his heart into every note he sings. This album had my head bobbing on their fast songs. I even enjoy the pop sounding ballard ""here to you"". My favorite is the second cut ""Life Again""."
5,Caleb Oliver Beats TJ Harris By a Mile,"Decyfer Down had two lead singers, and their first one was Caleb Oliver, who left in 2008 due to family issues. He should not have left.This CD is a perfect record- no joke. Songs like Fight Like This, Life Again, Break Free, Burn the Back Sun, I'll Breathe For You, and especially Never Lost are excellent songs. I can play guitar to these songs perfectly! Especially Never Lost and Life Again, the latter being the best track on here. I recommend it!Rating: 5 stars/5 stars"
4,Solid album with distinctive sound,"The world of Christian music has definitely changed and the addition of Decypher Down is a welcome one. They are bringing a new level with Crash but they should work at exploring more melodies and percussion dynamics, overall they are a very good addition to the Alternative/post-grunge Christian music scene."
4,Beautiful soulful album,"I heard about Selena when she added me on Myspace!Normally I ignore band-adds, but her profile was playing the mournful track ""Silence"" and I loved it - and bought the album. She is skillful vocalist - the album is good range of gentle upbeat pop and soulful ballads.Favorite tracks -#3 Memories Won't Fade - dramatic with hints of Natalie Imbruglia.#5 And you were There - a soulful love song#11 Save Me - a slow lament, with relentless drum beat.#12 Silence - a slow and dramatic piano/voice solo, best on the album."
1,Sizing,"Its not an easy task triyng to choose the right head without having the right information but this one Remo could not find an answer for me,Toca Elite Pro Series congas (fiberglass) do not match up. I have gotten in contact with Remo and they were just as puzzled..."
3,Another Game That Failed To Deliver....,"Once again I had high hopes for this game as it seems from the descriptions to be a game I might like. Alas, I was again disappointed. The game ran very slowly and as with another game I got was so dark I had trouble telling what was goibbng on. On these types of problems, I usually try turning off as much high end graphics and see if the game play improves. But this didn't help this one. After working with it for about an hour, I had to uninstall it and save it for the next system I get which might run it better."
5,"ACTUALLY, I CAN'T WAIT TO REC. I'M SURE IT'LL BE 5-STAR. KIMMY WILL BE BACK!","ACTUALLY, I CAN'T WAIT TO REC. I'M SURE IT'LL BE 5-STAR. KIMMY WILL BE BACK!"
3,The Long Way Book,"I was very disappointed in this book because I looked forward to my finance class in college. But this book was poorly put together - one short paragraph would talk about carry forward and back but nothing was elaborated on the subject - it would just go right into the equation. I heavily depended on the professor's lecture and not once referred to the book when studying for the exam. However, I did use the book to make sure I was using the correct terminology for the exam."
4,Great introductory book for finance,I bought this book for my class. Not sure what else to say other than the book is great for beginners and easy to read.
4,Fundamentals of Financial Management: Concise,"The quality of the book was very good. There was a large amount of highlighting but, the price was fair. The book was shipped with good packing materials and received in an expected time frame."
3,Very pleased!!,"I was thrown in for a loop when I was told I was going to be the new pole vaulting coach this past year. I knew absolutely nothing about the event, or how to train my athletes. This dvd really helped on showing the different types of techniques that one would need to use to train thier athlete. Also, by watching the dvd with my athletes we were both able to watch the jumps and try to analyze how to improve her skills as well. It was a great resource to have."
1,Not as described,"I agree with the other review. They are only cardboard and read as a ""tuff tear"" construction is VERY misleading. I an running an evaluation and now I don't even have time to order more. Very dissapointed."
2,Not as described,"The ""tuff tear"" paper is nothing more than card stock. It is misleading that it is tough tear."
4,Clever and colorful,"This a very nice book for 2-4 year olds. There are commonsense scenes that will teach, and plenty of animals to keep the child's attention. The illustrations are oddly unique, and very colorful. A very nice addition to the library."
1,The Depths of Utter Pretentiousness,"The completely shallow nature of this collection of abysmal photos is no surprise coming from self-indulgent schlock-meister Teller. But what is far more shocking than its toilet-level content is acclaimed actress Charlotte Rampling's involvement in the cringe-inducing proceedings. This is a career-suicide project causing one to wonder precisely why Ms Rampling would debase herself in such a very public way. Furthermore, it does nothing but tarnish the achievement of her cultivation of a rare cinematic mystique combining intelligence and sexuality. Hopefully for Ms Rampling, the book will disappear quickly and she will come to her senses. As for Teller? Here's some advice--please put some clothes on and grow up...or better yet, just go away."
4,Lester is good,It is a little dated. Update was helpful. It is a good general guide and insight into what building wealth is all about
3,Building Wealth + The Future of Capitalism = One Great Book,"This books is really an addendum to The Future of Capitalism. Concerning the third wave economy, he says little that he and others (i.e., Reich, Ohmae, etc.) haven't said before. What's new here is some amount of advice that is broadly useful to any individual operating in the new economy. This is NOT a ""What Color is Your Parachute"" for the 2000s, but he does bring home some points regarding education, career management, and U.S. vs. E.C.U. vs. Asia competition of which we should all be mindful. As always, his style is fluid and comprehendible to non-economists. That is why he's so widely read. However, his metaphor of the ""wealth pyramid"" is ineffective due to underdevelopment. I recommend this book as the best primer for anyone wanting to learn the basic issues of the new economy. If you've read Thurow's recent works, this one will offer a few additional insights."
2,"He's OK, but he's no Krugman.","This book is a very fun read for those who are interested in economics. However, Dr. Thurow seems more intent on thrilling the reader than basing his arguments on reality. This book would be wonderful if he could back up more of his arguments. Still, it's fun to pick through Dr. Thurow's mind and see what he sees in the future of world economics."
2,No credibility: Called for industrial policy in 1980s,"Mr. Thurow called for central planning of the US economy back in the 1980s. He cited Japan's model as an example of what a centrally planned economy could achieve for its citizens. He could not have been more off base. How does he keep his job? If I made wild recommendations to my employer that were so wrong, I would be out on my back side. Mr. Thurow are you a socialist? How would MITs innovations reach the market under your programs? How could you advocate central planning when it has been proved wrong everywhere? Is it elitism that drives your analysis? Why don't you beleieve in the power of markets and individuals?"
1,"How can one be wrong so much, and yet be successful?","It is so sad how wrong someone can be proven over and over again and still, he/she is rewarded, called a genius and is allowed to teach our youth. Here is a quote from the author: ""Can economic command significantly... accelerate the growth process? The remarkable performance of the Soviet Union suggests that it can... Today the Soviet Union is a country whose economic achievements bear comparison with those of the United States."" This was in 1989, just shortly before the Societ Union collapsed. Unfortunately, being this wrong in economics gives one awards and allows you to teach college students while being described a genius. Sad. Mr. Thurow may be a 'genius', but geniuses can be wrong too."
1,"Pretty bad, doesn't take reality into account...","I got a third of the way through it, and decided that he wasn't expaining anything new and his reasoning lacked reasonableness. I don't have too much time to waste on this so I'll describe the book as: contradictory, biased, unrealistic, similar to his other works about the collapse of the US in the 90's."
2,Interesting: But Any More Useful Than His Other Books? No.,"Having read other Thurow books, and recalling particularly ""Head To Head"" from 1991, I'd say despite his authoritative writing and recognizable name, we have no particular reason to think he'll be right this time. Look at ""Head to Head,"" in your local library and see how well this talking head predicted such things as Japan's economic collapse and the U.S.'s continued global competitiveness. Thurow has made an industry out of books that have useful lifespans of six months."
5,Great Perspective,"Building Wealth delivers the same level of analytical depth and breadth that Thurow's readers have come to expect. Excellent insights are drawn from a truly impressive set of research efforts. Lester Thurow assimilates a hugely broad set of general and industry-specific research into what is essentially a series of essays centered on the theme of explaining relationships within the ""wealth pyramid.""Great reading for anyone looking for a little perspective and context in which to frame today's hyper-speculative technology stock boom. Thurow’s analytics provide a good refresher on international and traditional economic theory. Building Wealth is a solid sounding board that reflects characteristically strong direction for public policy. Fun read, and excellent conclusions."
5,A feast for the peepers!,"Tony is one of the few living artists whose work reverberates with me. Each of his etchings has the complexity and scope of a really good movie. There is so much going on in each piece that you could sit looking at one for an hour, come back to it the next day and have an ""oh I didn't notice that before"" moment. I love all of Tony's work, but this book really shook me. Wonderful!"
3,artist apron,"Wish this had sleeves, the plastic is pretty hard or thick not sure if that is good or bad, probably good for durability or bad movement restriction. Its pretty big too big for my 2 year old i use clothes pins or clips to keep it on. Keeps paint off clothes thats always good but could fit better."
3,Mextar Ma715-20B,My daughter is still using it after 1 year.Con: dust can get inside the screen (no sealing at all)
3,"A lot of room, but not the quality I expected","We wanted a locking video cabinet for our R movies and more violent video games now that the boys are getting old enough to work the video player & Playstation themselves.The cabinet assembled easily enough with some forethought and has made it through a move in the proper number of pieces.Unfortunately, the swinging doors have settled the hinges and now the lock doesn't latch to the top.Also, it would be nice if there were metal extensions for the latch slot instead of relying on particle board.I'm not sure I would by another one knowing that we'll be moving again in a couple years... maybe after we get there."
4,It Woks Great!,I cant believe the difference it makes when I take it. I ordered it and it arrived right on time. Will continue to purchase more in the future.
5,Just what the good Doctor ordered!,"For the many single, divorced and frustrated marriageable women looking for a responsible mate, this book is a lodestone. Not only is it for Black women but definately crosses racial lines for all American women, regarless of color.Dr. McElroy not only tells you how, but more importantly gives you practical methods for finding that only previously dreamed of accountable lifemate.As a practicing psychotherapist and marriage and family counsellor for over 30 years I not only can unequivocally recommend this book but must add it is a ""must"" read for all resposible women desiring that special soulmate."
5,Trophy Man,"This book is the How-To I have been looking for my whole life. I am not a black woman, but I found this book right on. It is well written and insightfull. I sent copies to all my single friends and I strongly recommend it to any intelligent woman who is wondering if there is any hope."
2,How to transition from hooker to callgirl.,"This book is very helpful for prostitutes trying to upscale their customer base. But any woman needing/trusting a book like this to find a husband is misguided and confused; not to mention amoral. GOOD LUCK TO ALL OF YOU SEXUALLY, EMOTIONALLY, AND FINACIALLY FRUSTRATED LOSERS!"
1,"Can you Say ""Women's Right""","This book attempts to push women, 50 years backward in their quest for equal rights.You gold digger should instead, purchase a self-help book on ""education, establishing wealth, and fame"" for you're damn self. Instead of trying to leach off a Man. Women don't need to find a Trophy Man, they can become Trophy for themselves, and only require love and Trust form them Partners. Anytime you judge a potential partner partner, based on there wealth, or material processions (not on their character) you are prostituting. Which's makes you a HO.Brothas Beware"
1,What a waste!!!,"Aviation & airport enthusiasts beware!!!I bought this book on the title alone thinking it was some comprehensive book about PDX and found it to have little about the airport. Instead, it's really more of a PR piece for (perhaps) the chamber of commerce with lots of profiles of local companies and essays about what a great place Portland is. It looks like something that should've been given out to companies that were thinking of setting-up shop in Portland.What it does have about the airport is pretty generic in nature with no diagrams and not much in the way of great photos. What's even more of a joke is that this book was originally priced at $34.95 when it was published back in 1997. I pity anyone who paid full price for this."
1,Another deceptive missionary work,"By cherry-picking some stories, the author has done a great favor to the western and Christian readers. We need to ask ourselves when we are going to stop dishonest portrayal of Muslim societies. I can also list all the ills in the Western society and blame it on Christianity like rape, teenage pregnancy, high rate of divorce, infidelity, adultery, AIDS and other STDs, promiscuity, birth out of wedlock, domestic abuse etc. The freedom of women in the western world has nothing to with Christianity. The progress and enlightenment in the Western world evolved from anti-religious secular ideas. Democracy, freedom, and liberty all originated from non-Christian thoughts which are certainly not un-Christian or un-Islamic."
2,Not a good cleaner,"Looks very thin, like water. Almost no suds. Feel ripped off. Been buying wig shampoo for years and have never ever seen a shampoo that looks this thin. Will definitely not buy this product again."
4,THIS IS NOT YOUR TYPICAL DELTA FORCE STORY,"I ANTICIPATE HIS SECOND BOOK...THIS IS NOT YOUR TYPICAL, EVERYDAY DELTA FORCE STORY. READERS WHO ENJOY READING CLANCY OR MARCINKO (ECT) WILL EASILY GO FOR THIS ONE! HEY I THINK THIS WRITER IS A ""CAG"" OPERATOR. ITS A FAST READ THAT HOLDS YOUR ATTENTION THROUGHOUT. THE WRITER HAS EXCELLENT TECHINICAL DESCRIPTION OF SPECIAL OP EQUIPTMENT AND TACTICS. THE WRITER HAS DONE WELL WITH RESEARCH FOR ALL THE PLACES CAG VISITS. CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT IS GOOD BUT HAS POTENTIAL FOR INDEPTH IN ADDITIONAL STORIES. THE BOOK IS NOT A NOVEL BUT I THINK AFTER YOU READ IT YOU'LL BE HOOKED TO THE LEAD GOOD GUY - JOHN STONE."
2,"Decent story, too many grammatical errors","I think the author did a good job on the story line. I really liked his knowledge and the information on CAG. However, I couldn't read two or three sentences without finding some sort of grammatical error. I found myself spending more time going back and reading again sentences just to make sense of where the story was going. I would gladly pay $...for the Rouge Warrior's book as to waste my time and money on what was a decent book that severely neeeded proof reading by a 4th grade English teacher."
1,Avoid at all costs!,"Littered with more typos and grammatical errors than I could believe possible, this ""book"" reads like it was written by a grade school drop out. The dialogue is flat and the characters are so unbelievably boring it's a struggle to get past the first 30 pages.The printing appears to be done via a laser printer, running low on toner, with the fonts jacked to a very large point size(presumably to inflate the page count of the thing). The illustrations inside are worse than laughable...I have no idea if the author was really in the military or not, as his bio claims, but this reeks of someone just cashing in on the latest fad (military special operations). If you want to read some authentic and well written material about SFODD check out Eric Haney's book. He was in Delta. Or check out Bob Mayer's Dave Reily books.This is one of the worst things I have ever read. Seriously. Avoid like the plague."
1,Incredibly insulting quality,"I am willing to give anyone a break or benefit of the doubt. When I saw the poor quality of this book, my first impression was that it took no imagination and less talent to put this book together. The craftmanship of this book makes small press released books look like the high-end publishers.It is that bad.Adding insult to injury is the price for this piece of work.Avoid it."
5,Was this book written in 1943,Tucker's People was a book written in 1943. I do not remember the author. It is about a crooked lawyer who was manipulated by a man named Tucker. It was made into an interesting movie staring John Garfield. Is this the same book
1,aCROCKalypse,"Lordi comes across as so blatantly calibrated for chaw-chewin NASCAR buttwipes that it's really hard to believe they are from Finland. That's like saying the top ballet school in the U.S. operates on the tarmac at Oakland International Airport. These twits are like Jerry Lewis, sans Dean Martin, banging pots and pans in the basement.I'm sorry, I don't get the joke, other than that built into the mix is an unspoken Grand Joke by design. If it's such a tongue-in-cheek, farcical, fist-pumping party-down good time, why is it so boring? Tired chops no more biting than Journey and a snarl that brings to mind Wolfman Jack and makes me think surely Alice Cooper is rolling around in his above-ground grave -- oh yeah, but he's a sellout; thanks for reminding me, beatbajer!Anyhoo. I'm sure none of this is getting through, your brain-cheese stuffed with axle grease, your eye whatzits spinning in reverse, locked into laptop chick meat and bbq pork rinds."
5,Monsters of rock unite!!,"The DVD containing videos and a live show make this worth the money right from the word go.If you have never heard these guys but remember them from the biggest ever eurovision win in history then this is a great place to start, if you do know them because you have the monster show CD/DVD then you know what you are in for.Lordi are not breaking any new ground, they play by the numbers hard rock with a theatrical twist.Whilst it has been done before, Lordi are the only ones doing it now and doing it well.So if you are looking for music to save the environment with, forget it. If you wnt to have a good time with a band that knows what the spirit of hard rock is all about then The arockalypse is for you...All together now... who's your daddy... buy it, you'll know what I mean."
4,"A page turner, couldn't put it down!","This book is one of the best I've read in a while. The interplay between Yourdon and Tasia made a great sub-plot, reminds me of when me and my fiance first met. Will there be a sequel? A very good fantasy novel. I highly recomend it."
4,A TRUE WORK OF ART,THE INTERACTION BETWEEN YOURDON AND TASIA IS ONLY PART OF WHAT MAKES THIS BOOK AS GOOD AS IT IS. IT REMINDS ME OF THE SHANNARA SERIES IN THE WAY THAT YOURDON MUST NOT ONLY COME TO GRIPS WITH THE POWER WITHIN HIMSELF BUT WITH HIS FATE AS WELL.
5,The Complete Metalsmith; An illustrated Handbook,"""The Complete Metalsmith;An Illustrated Handbook"", this book is great even better than I had hoped The book is very informative."
4,the complete metalsmith,"This book was recommended to me by several of my silversmithing instructors as the ""go to book"" to have. I have read it from cover to cover and back again. The information is consise and well organized for the beginner to advanced metalsmith. The illustrations are particularly helpful. The only ""ding"" would be an addition of another section to discuss which silver gauges would best be suited for what projects. This would be very helpful in planning your metal purchases for each type of project."
2,Who's the audience?,"This book is strange because it goes back and forth between seeming to be for beginners and advanced metal smiths. I think if the author had defined his audience before constructing the book, he may have done a better job. Another problem is that full chapters are crammed onto one page, with illustrations that sometimes do, sometimes don't relate to the text. And the text is so abbreviated that it's hard to get any real information out of it. I wish I could recommend a better book for the the beginner metal smith (which I am), but I have yet to find one."
5,Older version of book is still a good book,This book is an excellent one especially for the novice metalsmith (me). It's illustrations are great and correct. The steps listed in accomplishing each task are clear and concise. I recommend it for novices like myself although I imagine it is informative and worth keeping on the work bench of Metalsmithing Artists.
4,Go-To Reference,"This is a great reference for anyone working with metals. I've owned a copy of this for nearly 20 years and bought this one to give as a gift to a friend who is just starting. There are so many times when you would just like to have a clue how to approach something or to know what your options are and this book lays them all out for you. The drawings are fairly clear as long as you are somewhat analytical. It also helps to be in a classroom situation so this is not your only ""teacher."" Great helping reference though!"
5,Really glad to have this book.,This book had been recommended to me by my silversmith teacher. It is well worth the small amount I paid for it....and it came soooo quick!
4,Complete Metalsmith,This is a great book for beginners. It was a required resource for a jewelry class I took many years ago. I bought a new copy for my son when he got interested in jewelry making. Over the years the material has stayed pretty much the same with a lot of additions. It is a very straight forward easy to understand book. It is a good basic resource for anyone interested in doing metalsmithing or jewelry work.
4,Great reference,"The Complete Metalsmith presents a broad overview of the craft of working with non-ferrous metals. This book won't teach you everything you need to know about metalsmithing, but it will give you a great introduction to lots of areas. It's also a great bench reference that even the experienced worker will use again and again."
3,Language Issue,"Difficult to use if don't know Greek or French. I eventually found what I wanted, but took a lot of effort to locate towns and islands."
5,Wonderful,"Although I did not buy my first bottle from Amazon, this is a wonderful spray that makes ironing a delight. As I used the spray I added water to the bottle and the scent was still present. I am finally ready for a new bottle. The spray nozzle itself is a really good one and has so far lasted over 2 yrs. This is one of those excellent products that you hope never gets discontinued or changed in any way."
1,"Not on par with the ""walking with"" series","This film disappointed me. The animation is sub-par and the feature itself is too short. The background story is weak and the music sounds like it was generated from a MIDI program on a kids PC. Save you money and rent it instead. This film is not in the same class of quality as the ""walking with"" series."
2,"Nice eye candy, but movie itself is lacking.","This Blu-ray Disc has excellent picture and sound. However, I found the movie itself to be lacking. First of all, the content of this movie could have been narrated in 15 minutes; as a result, the movie seems to repeat the same concept over and over again therefore being very predictable in where it is going.Second of all, the movie was very obviously designed to be watched in 3-D. The effect is just not the same in 2-D as fish swim towards the screen in 2-D and objects awkwardly jut towards the camera. While I'm sure this movie was engaging in 3-D, watching at home in 2-D was actually rather boring and non-engaging.I've thoroughly enjoyed other National Geographic presentations on Blu-ray such as Relentless Enemies, however this one seems to be short on substance and designed for color 3-D delivery which is not really possible on Blu-ray yet. I'd avoid this despite its interesting sounding title."
2,not worth the money,"I guess I expected too much from this show, and was let down when I saw it. It wasn't extremely terrible, but it was terrible. THe CGI was very cheap looking, and it was way too short (of course they didn't have much to work with).Save your money and go buy Walking with Dinosaurs, its more expensive, but totally worth it. Even Dinosaur planet or When dinos roamed america is better, just don't waste your time with this."
3,"Not very good for adults, nor for kids","The scenario and some scenes look childish, and the CGI looks like that of an old video game. It is only for kids. Nevertheless, it includes many 'educational' scenes, which the kids don't enjoy. Walking with... series of BBC was good for both adults and kids. This is not for anyone."
2,Sea Monsters DVD,"I normally do not post reviews but in this case I felt compelled to. The folks that I purchased this DVD from have been great; they exchanged the defective DVD with another defective DVD (both were new and factory sealed). Both had blank or bad spots in the same places, therefore I have come to the conclusion that this is just a bad reproduction. The move is not all that good and the animation parts are where most of the defects are located. Save your money and purchase a better ""prehistoric monster"" move such as ""the walking with"" series."
3,Not as good as the BBC series,"I got this because I loved the BBC series Walking with Dinosaurs. However, National Geographic: Sea Monsters - A Prehistoric Adventure (In 3-D) [Blu-ray] isn't quite as good as that series. Rather, it features clips of paleontologists digging for fossils, with scenes of the CG sea monsters interspliced. As such, it isn't as entertaining or exciting as the BBC series, which shows just the dinosaurs. If you want a great series on prehistoric sea monsters, check out BBC's Chased By Dinosaurs, which in addition to dinosaurs has a mini-series featuring sea monsters that is much longer than National Geographic: Sea Monsters - A Prehistoric Adventure (In 3-D) [Blu-ray]. In the series, Nigel Marvin chases, and in turn is chased by, sea monsters from a variety of different time periods. It's both more entertaining and educational."
4,"Visually beautiful, best for late elementary/Jr high age kids","I was hoping for more of an adult documentary with more details that ran a bit longer, but this is really excellent as a sort of science museum film for families with school age children. I plan on running it for a niece in that age range. For adults and very bright or older kids, it makes an excellent companion forOceans Of Kansas: A Natural History Of The Western Interior Sea (Life of the Past). Also check out the wonderful Oceans of Kansas web site."
3,Good,I purchased this to add to my sons growing collection of Prehistoric DVD's he loves it. The animations are great and make learning fun
2,OK if you enjoy computer created animation,"I guess I was a little disappointed that this whole film was computer created animation even though the images were realistic. If you enjoy watching prehistoric creatures in action, this may be the video for you but I enjoy ""live"" animals much much more so I was really not too turned on by this film."
5,Tis unfortunate,"Frank Black Francis is not a best of album. The first disk takes us back to the beggining of the pixies and lets us see were the songs began. This is the freshest you will hear these songs. I recomend the first disk for hard core pixie or Frank Black fans, it is excelent stuff, but only if you are interested in it.The second disk is a compleat reworking of origional pixies songs, into newish lounge music. I can see a lot of hard core fans dislikeing this disk, or loving it to death. This is a disk that will polarize people, its a love it or hate it album. I love it!!"
4,Not sure what to make of it,"This set comes on two discs. One is early demo tracks of Pixies songs performed by just Frank Black and his guitar. Two is what I can only describe as reminaginings of classic Pixies songs.The demos are amazing. Raw, a little dirty in the sound quality, and rough around the edges. It's like listening to old friends who were recorded before I met them.The re-imagined versions are a whole other thing. It's not that I feel like hey have no business messing with classic songs this way. I love to hear different versions of the same song. It's just that I'm not sure I like the style in which it was done. Some, like ""Cactus"" and ""Where is My Mind"" are cleverly done enough. But as a whole the tracks come off as unfocused and even, in a couple of cases, boring.Still, they are Mr. Black's songs to let people mess with as he wishes.I'm not going to call it horrible, but I'm not sure very Pixies fan will be into this. In fact I'm sure some will outright hate it."
3,a 50-50 proposition,"Had to rate this only 3 stars to split the difference between the 2 discs. The first disc of demos? GREAT! Give that a very solid 5. But the second rates a zero and even less if it were possible. Consider this a single CD with bonus metallic coaster. Absolute, utter travesty of the songs and so BORING it is unreal. For the most part Frank leaves me bored, sleepy and unsatisfied these days. Sad, sad, sad. I used to be such a huge fan."
3,Pixies Fans....get this,"As much as I like Kim Deal, I have to say the Frank Black version of Into the White is the best I ve heard so far. I find it pure and heart wrenching.Just like Kim Deal s cover of Neil Young s I ve been waiting for you was much better than the original (in this case though, Frank s version is the original)"
4,My fault,I guess I should have asked if the scratch and sniff aspect of the book still worked - it didn't - but then how much can I expect for one dollar............still it is a cute book - thanks for the quick ship.
1,Not worth reading,"I read the Bourne books of his and one or 2 others and liked them very much. This book was SO unrealistic with unbelievably bad and inappropriate dialogue that I could barely finish it.The whole deal with the crew of the AWAC having this wierd sexual tension and saying time and time again ""You're not going without us"" was embarrassingly unreadable. The closeness of the protagonist and antagonist was annoying. Stick with the Bourne series or other authors for a better spy-thriller experience."
3,Wavering!!!,"I would like to make it clear that Ludlum will have to reinvent himself to catch up with the times. What was great reading in the 70s is not gonna cut now. The material in this book is essentially recycled from his earlier books and today's soap operas. Please, give us something realistic and new. That is all I am gonna say Robert!"
3,More of the same,"Its not that I don't like Robert Ludlum, its just that this book really doesn't stand out. Its one of those books that you have in your possesion so you know you read it. At the end of the day you just can't recall a single detail about it.If you want a book that the author put some serious thought into read ""Bourn Idenity"" or even ""Road to Omaha"".Overall-This one just doesn't cut it"
1,Disappointing,"Started out well setting up the characters of Tyrell Hawthorne and Amaya Bajaratt pursuing one another around the Caribbean. A potentially good story then falls flat with overlong narrative which makes the readers out to be stupid. Ludlum here instead on concentrating on the main two players throws in an over complex narrative with subplots that just seem to go nowhere and distract the reader. The military element in the book is also poorly researched. Supposedly tailor-made for the 1990s, it belongs in the 1970s - an era when Ludlum was writing his best material. And then he also falls for the trap of awful dialogue -overuse of the words 'darling' and 'my love' like a dime-store pulp romance for bored housewives! Cringe. Let us not forget the other cliche - constant references to TV, actors, personalities to bring out a characterisation or plot device. If you're new to Ludlum, avoid this one. Read THE MATARESE CIRCLE or THE BOURNE IDENTITY first."
4,Works the mind!,"I read this book about 6-8 months ago and I found that it was a book that although I couldn't put down, I had too just so I could from time to time figure out what was what. I don't think that you could read this book all in one full swoop. It made you think and was a great book with all it's twists and turns. An awesome read!"
1,Horrid Writing,You may like to curl up with a great action-packed spy novel. If so this is not the book. The characterization is weak. The plot is non-existent. The dialog downright silly. Ludlum has written some great spy novels....
1,Not Ludlum's best!,Just too many coincidences to make this even close to believable. Have read all of Ludlum's other books and enjoyed most of them. This book was just too predictable and not what I would call a good read. Try early Ludlum's if you are new to this author
2,The Scorpio Illusion,The strange line spacing is very disturbing. It is very hard to understand the differences between the various spacings; sometimes it means silence between conversation lines and sometimes it is a pause between chapters. Veru confusing. Had I known this I'd have skipped this purchase.
3,Perfect for a Gloomy Weekend!,Tore right through it - even though the plot makes no sense! Would love for this to be a movie!
3,Not Free SF Reader,"The Scorpio illusion does have a professional spook as its protagonist. Or an ex spook anyway. Again, we have someone who gives the game away when his bedwarmer and better half gets killed because of an operation gone wrong.He gets pulled back in because they need him to stop and find a female assassin who can lead him to information to uncover and stop a sinister plot."
1,Not for everyone,"I was disappointed to learn that you cannot use this product if you have cycles that are longer than 38 days. However, nowhere on this amazon page or on the product's original website, does it state this information. I was pleased with Amazon's return policy and had no problem at all getting my money back, but I feel this information should be stated right up front so others can make a more informed purchase."
1,NOT WORTH THE MONEY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,The sensors do not stay in the watch and there is nothing to hold them in place. My first sensor broke before i could even use it $30 down the drain. My second sensor fell out while I was sleeping and has disappeared. Therefore another $30 down the drain and another month of not using this watch. I bought the OV-Watch brand. I followed the directions clearly. my husband even tried (and he's a doctor!) They sensors were OV Watch sensors so i would expect them to fit like a glove. I expected wrong. I would not recommend this watch to anyone. I is so frustrating / upsetting that ths watch was so poorly designed I will even post a video to show how the watch sensor does not fit in the watch.
2,OV Watch - needs some TLC,"I'm also disappointed with the OV watch. As set the watch for my first cycle, the 'B' button feel off. I emailed customer care and was prompty was told to ring the help desk. As Im in Australia its hard to reach the US during business hours. Anyway, I managed to set up the watch and all went well for the first month. Then on the second month attempt, the watch had trouble reading on Test mode displaying 'No Reading' and 'Skin too Dry'. There must be something wrong with the sensor,as my skin is not dry and this worked the previous month. OV Watch need to step up and improve the quality and stabiltity of the OV Watch, especially based on price!"
1,This is a rip off!!,I purchased this item when TTC to confirm if I was ovulating. This watch did not tell me anything I couldn't of determined by using all of the free online calendars. The dates it displayed that I was predicted to ovulate were what I already knew. I wanted it to tell me if I was ovulating for sure. All this watch does it calculated your expected days to ovulate based up on the number of days in your cycle. Had I not had it for over 30 days I would have sent it back. Do not buy this thing!! Use the free calendars and ovulation predictors online...much more valuable.
1,Very disappointed,"The watch worked as expected the first two days, then watch kept saying ""Not Reading"" or ""Skin Too Dry"". I followed the troubleshooting instructions but that didn't resolve the issue. This watch costs too much to have to ""troubleshoot"" every month. I don't have time to waste on this product nor do I want to feel the resulting frustration. I am returning this product."
3,Customer Service SUCKS if it breaks!,I tried the watch for two months and it read just fine. By the third month it was not taking readings properly. In the fourth month it did not work at all. I tried to call customer service and you could only leave a message. I sent an email three days ago and still no response. I would think twice about spending the money.
1,terrible product,"I was really hopeful about this product. I knew it had mixed reviews, but my cycle is very regular and ovulation is pretty consistent, so I thought it would work. However, the screen was very dim from the moment I opened it, and the watch was not comfortable to wear. I went through a sensor within 10 days, and now the next one is drying up. I have followed all the directions accurately, including its storage, and it seems that the battery is dying. Ridiculous, after 10 days! I am grateful for Amazon's return policy, and when I get my money back, I will purchase something better."
1,Piece of junk,"Had one of the sensor packs die on me on Cycle Day 8, which meant I was out for the entire month. The next month, it told me I was entering my fertile phase two days AFTER my ovulation... that's right - fertile time had come and gone for the month. I had a 28-day cycle that month, too. OvWatch will mess with your hopes and lie to you outright!"
1,It didn't work for me,"This product seemed to work fine for the first month, but after that it didn't detect ovulation properly. The second and third months it detected ovulation a week late! I had to use an ovulation predictor kit to verify if the OV Watch was working correctly, and it was not. I received a surge from the OPK and the OV Watch didn't detect ovulation until much later. I was very disappointed with this product and the company only has a 30 day return policy. It takes more than 30 days to determine if this product is working for you. I wish I bought the Clear Blue Easy Monitor."
2,Temperamental and Disappointing :(,"Was so excited by the testimonials and had been trying for 7 months when I first started the OvWatch - been using it for over 6 months now - no baby! On top of that, the last 3 cycles it has been malfunctioning and saying 'not reading' and the screen is going dim. Will just have to start using another method and go see a fertility specialist. And OvWatch's guarantee sucks - only 30 days!!!I wouldn't rely solely on this method - use ov strips and/or BBT along with it to be sure.It's also bulky and uncomfortable, and very expensive to maintain (especially when you get nothing in return!!!!!!)"
1,expensive calendar,i bought this watch with the hopes that the maker of this item was making valid claims. 2nd month using this watch with a back up of the clear blue easy digital ovulation strips( the circle/ happy face ones)i had a lh surge before the watch even said i was on my fertile day 1. i have reg 28 day cycles. it looks like all this watch does is calculate an average based on your cycle length. so the expensive sensors are a waste of money if they don't actually read what they are suppose to do.
5,"Suprised, but it really does work!","This watch is going to make TTC much easier! My husband and I have been trying for about 3 yrs. I've always had problems with the pee sticks showing a positive. I was convinced that I wasn't ovulatng. Then on day 13 of wearing this watch it said ""fertile day 1"" I was so excited! We will see if we are pregnant in about 2 weeks, but I do feel hopefull with this watch. The only complaint is the size of the watch band... It's a little small, but you can call the company to get a longer strap."
4,OVWatch,The OVWatch is easy to use and understand. It is much better than the fertility stick you pee on!
1,Don't waste your money,"What a waste of money. This might work for someone who ovulates every month on the 15th but I don't. Thought it was funny that my chart & OPK's agreed I ovulated on cd 23 but the watch gave me the ""typical"" cycle days as most fertile."
2,not sure,This watch does nothing more than confirm what you are already learning from the ov predictor urine kits. just stick with them and don't waste your money. this item works it's just not needed. i used it the first 3 months i was trying to get preggo and it just made me crazy focusing on it. save yourself the headache in the tough times of trying to get preggo. btw i got preggo 4 months after i stopped with the watch
2,Doesnt seem very scientific,"Im sure there is a lot of science behind this product. However, it missed my ovulation consistantly. It almost seemed as though it would just subtract 14 days from the end of my last cycle when calculating when ovulation would occur. I have a 25 day cycle and ovulated three times around Day 9. The OV watch kept saying that I was ovulating on day 11."
1,Predicted ovulation 7 days too early - worthless!,I was also temping while using this - the BBT identified my ovulation on the day it occurred (my period started 14 days later) and the OV watch said it happened SEVEN days before the temp rise! I would have given up and missed ovulation completely if I had listened to this useless piece of technology. DON'T waste your money!The refund policy is useless - it will take more than 30 days to know whether it's working. Save your money.
3,didn't use it myself,"i bought this watch to help me conceive and the week it came in the mail i found out i was pregnant!! So, i never even opened the box. I did however send it to a friend who had trouble conceiving and she used it and used it and never conceived with it. she went to a specialist and was finally able to conceive and has a lovely little one now! I would have given it 1 star...but i consider the fact that i bought it to be ""lucky"", so i gave it 3 stars. but really, don't waste your money...use the money to see a good specialist instead."
4,The man behind the music,"yep, Alchemist picked up where Havoc left off, recreated the mobb sound, got QB on fire with street anthems all year long, so he had to make it official with one of the best release of 2004.""Hold you down"", the single for the album is reminiscent of Primo circa early nineties, with the soulfoul sample, scratched shoot outs and the strings playing in the back, it all blends together, without taking over the lyrics, only in NY.There's so much goodies on this one, and the collabos with the Mobb and D-Block on ""D-Block to QB"", B Real on ""Bang Out"", Nas on ""Tick Tock"", and that unadulterated wailing on ""It's a craze"", it's a lot of heat, not one filler, if you're familiar with QB artists, Mobb Deep, Cormega, AZ, Nas, matter of fact, if you're familiar with the NY sound, you will love it.Alchemist is the white son Primo never had. Let the Neptunes and Kanye West rule MTV, The Alchemist rules NY streets."
3,Alchemist - 1st Infantry,"This record is somewhere between a 3 and a 4 rating. The beats made by Al are outstanding, and on other albums would make superb hits, however some of the artists featured here destroy them. Lyrically, this album is average at best. The beats make this album what it is and are far better than almost any other hip-hop album around, yet they are almost damaged by the lyricists featured.top tracks:1-dead bodies (f. game & prodigy)2-the essence (f. the l.o.x.)3-it's a craze (f. mobb deep)4-for the record5-hold u down (f. nina sky, prodigy & illa ghee)"
3,"Alchemist Jacks Beats, but u don't touch on the Big picture!","Everyone is talking about how Alchemist jacked the Just Blaze beat for Hold You Down, which is very true, I knew that the first time I heard it. I still like the song, since people jack people all the time. The thing that I noticed first was that Prodigy was the one riding the beat, so it seems to me to be just another cheap shot by some half a$$ rapper to take a shot at the CEO. 'Understand' was a deep deep song, one of the best of the Dynasty, and Prodigy and Alchemist know this, and it seems petty to me, but also a little entertaining. Prodigy is desent, the CD is ok, didn't know Alchemist could rap either, but please leave it alone, don't throw rocks at thrown.ITS THE ROC!!!"
3,RE: Alchemist STOLE JayZ beat??? Nah god ya facts wrong,"Hey Mr. Delgado, why don't YOU do your homework and get YOUR facts straight. ""Soon You'll Understand"" was produced by Just Blaze on Jay's Dynasty Album in 2000. Nobody said Alchemist wasn't a producer...The dude simply said he questions his abilities, and I do too since he just bit Bleezy's beat. Ignorance is gonna forever ""hold you down."" Do your homework dawg, then maybe ""soon you'll understand."" As for 1st Infantry, I like the album, but since his ""best track"" was a rip, I can't rate it higher."
4,works OK as a skimmer. Sometimes is difficult to maintain,"I have been using htis skimmer for about 1 1/2 years. It works well, but would prefer something that is even bigger. Cleaning the filter sometimes can be a pain. It is pretty sturdy. No cracks in mine yet. Suggest you get 2 or 3 sets of filters so you can quickly change them out and then rinse out the old one and use again. I also added a steel wire to the basket to make a handle which makes it easier to pick up with my reacher (grabber)."
3,No More Mr. Nice Guy,"I've seen worse. Nightmares 4, 5, and ""Freddy's Dead"" sure were. This is a decent prequel for the Nightmare series. Directed by horror legend Tobe (Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Eaten Alive, Poltergeist) Hooper. It shows the origin of Freddy, the trial, the release (although it is inconsistent with the first movie's monologue by Nancy's mother), the murders, and the parents of Springwood torching Freddy. One of the few episodes worth seeing."
5,Best episode of the TV Show on Video.,"No More Mr. Nice Guy goes into the story of how Freddy became ""the man of your dreams."" Begins with his trial, goes through his death and beyond. Obvious loopholes in plotline from the movie's story kind of spoils it, but this is the best episode released on video. This episode was followed by (the non-video released) episode: Sister's Keeper."
2,Terrible,"This is the first episode of the series and I really expected a lot more. The story given contradicts the plot of the original Nightmare on Elm Street movie. The actor who portrays the lead cop is a horrible actor. I realize this is a tv series from the 80's and did not have the same budget as the movie, but I was grossly disappointed by this tape. Especially in the scene where they show Freddy's murder by the town's people and when he kills the guard. Even if you are a fan of the movie series, this tape will disappoint you. This movie is to be avoided."
2,"Kind Of A Weird TV Show, If You Ask Me","I've never seen this tv show before, and if I did then I must have been about two years old. It's not that bad, but I thought some parts were very boring and weird.This is the only 'Freddy's Nightmares' episode I have seen. I guess that means they're pretty rare.If you want to see this, then go for it. It's good to see a movie, before it goes out-of-print, even if it is bad. At least you can say to yourself, ""I have seen that movie, and a lot of people haven't."""
4,My new tent,"This tent is made for warm weahter, with no zip-up windows makes it a perfect tent for warmer climates.The rain fly keeps out all of the wet weather,and has a very nice bowl type floor to keep the water from entering the bottom of the tent.Another plus to this tent it has a over head storage bag that keeps your everyday use equipment out of the way.Would I buy this tent again,yes I would if something happen to this tent.I hope you can enjoy your camping like I do."
4,met our expectations,"My sweetie and I were quite happy with the first time out with the our Eureka Tetragon 8. Our maiden voyage with the tent was a three night wilderness canoe trip. First night out we had to set it up in a light rain. Stayed completely dry. We had light rain and some wind the rest of the trip. The tent continued to be a dry haven. It is easy to set up, the gear storage system worked well for us. It is definitely a three season tent. With the exception of the back window,the screened windows have no way of closing off to colder weather. But for what we needed, it worked well."
3,Tetragon 8,"The tetragon design is good but the overall quality has slipped. Pole clips are weak, rain fly ties needed to be reworked right out of the box and Eureke nylon zippers have not been ""Jake"" for awhile now and comstomer service is in large part, non existant. The price through Amazon is good and that is what makes it even worth concidering."
2,Poor poles,"This spring our Troop was upgrading our tents. We looked at several tents high and low dollar. We are replacing some Eureka Alpine series tents that are about 10 years old. They served us well. We purchased 4 Tetragon 8 for our boys and some Nenergy 1210 ( they were marked down to $75.00 )tents for the adults. The adult tents have done well, but the Tetragon 8s are dissapointing. Within two campouts 3 poles have broken. Two fly poles and one main pole. The two fly poles broke right at the coupler so we were able to shorten the poles 1/2"" each but the main pole broke in the middle of the shaft. I know for sure that no one was even in the tent when the pole snapped. We are now looking for more tents as the troop is growing. While it would be nice to have the same tents for the boys, Im afraid to buy any more Eureka tents. I have not, nor will I ""Apply"" for warranty for these tents. I have learned my lesson."
4,An interesting novel for teenagers.,This exciting book involves conflict and learning to grow up. I reccomend it to anyone who wants a good read.
3,Look for a better value,"I like these cable ties, but they are too expensive. Amazon.com has similar products that are more cost effective. For example, search for ""Velcro Reusable Self-Gripping Ties, 0.5 Inches x 8 Inches, Black/Gray, 50 Ties per Pack"""
1,Utter effing crap.,Crap. That is as good as I can put it. Its a horrible documentary with bad sound and even worse post production. Going in the round file immediately.
2,Disappointing,I was disappointed in this collection of stories. Most were depressing accounts of ill fated love affairs and family dysfunction during the Christmas season. I was really expecting more from Ms. Binchy. She doesn't usually disappoint.
1,A godd book with good stories.,"There are several stories in this book which are filled with Christmas spirites, and made me feel that there are always nice people around you, and there are always hopes. I enjoyed reading the book, and I am going to give this book to my Mom to enjoy."
1,Waste of time...,"This book was such a waste of my time. It was a series of little Christmas stories, most of which left you hanging as to the outcome. I kept waiting for it to go back to the story with the resolution, but it never happened. It's the worst book I've read in a very long time!"
5,"I laughed, I cried and most of all, I felt!","Maeve Binchy has povided a series of short stories about the holiday season and how it affects people. Many are bitter sweet, some are just plain sad, while others provide hope and insight. While some people may say that the character development is not what you would normally expect from a Binchy story, the fact that these are short stories make the task all the more impressive. Each story hits a nerve. My particular sensitive spot was relfected in the story of the ""difficult"" step daughter who eats all of the hors d'oerves to the horror of the step mom only to think that they were going to decorate her bedroom for her. An instant bond is built between the two women, one young and one old. Age differences, women in love with married men, widows dealing with the holidays and people with dreams. This is an excellent book for the holiday season. It is easy to read and would make an excellent gift."
1,Amy - a bookclub member in Ohio,This is in no way an inspirational or uplifting book for the holiday season. I found nearly all of the short stories to be modern day and even realistic stories - but of disfunctional families or relationships. I found it very depressing and hope to warn others that this book will definately not leave you in the holiday spirit but further depress you about the state of the world and how poorly people can treat one another.
2,<Groan> Predictable,"What I am at a loss to explain is why I finished it. Ever hopeful, I guess. These are the basic formulaic Binchy-craft, and just how many women can keep justifying their existence as the mistresses of married men, and why are the men so shallow, and why does it always take a handsome single stranger to lure poor, misunderstood mistress back to righteousness?"
2,This Year will be different.,I thought this was a full novel but as I read it was just short stories. Some were pleasant but others really didn't have a good ending & left you hanging. I love Maeve Binchy books but this one didn't hold my attention like the others did. I wish I could return it & get another full novel book.
4,True to life stories about the holidays,"What a great collection of stories. I have never read any other Maeve Binchy books, but this one was recommended to me because, well, Christmas has not always been my fav. The stories are all around the idea that the build up does not equal the end result and that sometimes the holidays are just yucky. Some characters have experiences that are better than their usual, just not the picture perfect ideal. I thought they were well written with great characters and interesting situations. It wasn't depressing, just real. A few stories were actually inspirational to a person like me who knows that perfection does not happen just because you wish for it. Sometimes there is just movement towards better. Really, a nice collection."
5,This Year it will be Different,I recommend that you sit down by the fireplace or Christmas tree and read this book during the Holidays. It will make you feel great inside. The stories are short and heart-warming to the soul.
2,What a downer!,"My mother buys me a Christmas book every year around the holidays. I've always loved a good uplifting Christmas tale ever since the first time I read ""A Christmas Carol"" when I was about 13.A few years ago I received this book. Being a fan of Maeve Binchy I was looking forward to reading it. Wasn't I surprised to find that only 2 or 3 of the 15 or so stories were uplifting and even those were borderline? Most of the stories were filled with every kind of downtrodden character you can imagine performing every kind of unsavoury act.The two stars I give this book are only for the writing which is not bad. For content and sentiment I give nothing.If you want a good Christmas story - get yourself a copy of ""A Christmas Carol"" by Charles Dickens. Don't waste your money on this drivel."
3,A mix of nice and not-so-nice,"This book had some stories in it that were a tad uplifting, but there were too many other stories with cheating husbands. That was a bummer; I was hoping the whole book would be full of feel-good Christmas tales, not feel-depressed. Anyway, my favorite was the first story, ""The First Step of Christmas."" I just prefer the happy endings!"
3,Zealot Reviewers,I just can't believe the one star reviewer uses the same excessive amount of radical language and ideas that he accuses Knitter of. Zealots of any stripe are of little use to a society that is striving toward the peace and love Jesus implores us to practice.
5,"Great medical thriller, great characters!","This book captures you from the very beginning and makes you see the world through the eyes of Dr. Sarah Baldwin. Very detailed medical information and a fast read. Keeps you going from the first page to the last.Dr. Baldwin is the kind of doc most people in this open-minded society would want to have -- one with the Western science medicine as well as using holistic practices such as accupuncture. She gets in trouble after two women die and one woman is maimed in their pregnancies after taking her herbal supplement for pregnancy, which she recommends instead of the usual vitamins. An intrigue follows which delves into politics and money. Great mystery up until the very end, when one of the last people you'd suspect turns out to be the bad guy!My first taste of Michael Palmer, and I'm looking forward to reading more!"
5,Couldn't Put it Down,"I am an OB nurse and really enjoyed this book, found it believable and couldn't wait to turn the page. This is 3rd book of Michael Palmers I have read and this was the best!"
3,Nothing to write home about,"This book was Ok. I've read a few of Palmer's books and this was not my favorite. It wasn't terrible, just nothing too exciting.It's about a hospital that is mixed with traditional type doctors vs. new-age doctors. And when pregnant women start dying from some unknown cause, the two clash on what is the cause.The characters were interesting, as the scenario. The ending was pretty easy to guess. Overall it was a decent read, just nothing to write home about."
3,UNNATURALLY LONG,"NATURAL CAUSES is a decent medical thriller, with some complex twists and turns thrown in, but Palmer takes too long to get to these twists. Once he does, however, he keeps the plot cooking. I liked the characters of Sarah Baldwin and Matt Daniels. The accused doctor and her defense make an intriguing couple, battling with the ethical logicities of being client and lawyer and lovers. The villains, and there are many of them, are cliche and the twists toward the end can be seen earlier if you pay attention to the lot of the clues Palmer buries. Particularly good among the supporting characters is Dr. Rosa Suarez, the CDC whose investigation into the cause of the DIC brings the final clues. Cinematic, to say the least, but a little long in the tooth to make it a classic. Palmer does know however how to blend his medical knowledge and a crisp mystery too."
1,Mistakes left and right...,"I have been playing guitar for over 15 years and have been into Dream Theater since Images And Words came out. All the tabs in this book (even in all the previous ones) have mistakes. I believe that the tabbers that do these books are Joe Shmoes that don't even listen to Dream Theater and just put something out just to put it out. If you want more acurate tabs for the songs, go to powertab archive and get them for free (tabbed by actual fans of the band)If I could, I would give a rating of 0 stars.......eh....the artwork is nice...... The one star goes for the packaging."
5,So You Like Stories.....,"""So hello already. I hear you're looking for a good story or two. Well you came to the right place. You want stories? I'll give you stories."" So begins Uncle Blubbafink's introduction and he's off and running. He's got stories all right. Silly, humorous, outrageous tales with titles like Abraham Sandwich and George Washing Machine, The Legend of Smoky the Volcano, and The Dragon Whose Head Was A Station Wagon, that will have kids laughing out loud and rolling in the aisles. Keith Graves' witty, irreverent, easy to read text, written in hip, kid-speak language is complemented by his marvelously bright, bold, wacky artwork, including changing font styles and colors and youngsters will revel in all the busy, vivid details. Perfect for kids 9-12, Uncle Blubbafink's Seriously Ridiculous Stories really captures pre-adolescent humor, is a book your kids will want to read again and again and we can only hope Mr Graves is busy writing more."
3,"Okay, but could be better.","I'm a beginner, but I've been using these fins for a few weeks now and although I like the feeling of wearing fins (very zippy), they just aren't very comfortable to me. I have size 11 feet, which is right between the size range listed. But if I cinch the strap on tight enough to stay on my foot, I end up getting a sore spot on the outside of my feet, just below the base of my small toe. If it is any looser, the strap falls off (yes, even mid-lap).Maybe my feet are too wide for them, so your results may vary."
4,Good Product/Nice Workout For Your Legs,"Have used these for 5 weeks now and am pleased so far with these fins. Quality is good andhaven't had any problems with them at this point. The reason I didn't give them 5 stars wasfor sizing. I'm a solid size 12 and these fins are tight to get on with the straps fullyextended. I have to pull the backs over my heel and have no room for any more adjustment. I can't imagine how someone with size 13 feet could wear these. Once I do have them on and after a fewminutes, they are totally comfortable. I would rate these for size 10-12 feet. I would buy theseagain."
4,Pretty good swim fins!,"Fins work great, and they were a good deal. They do fit somewhat snuggly, so if you are a 13 or have a wide foot, this may be a consideration for you."
5,Zip Fins are Great!,My friend had an older pair and let me try them as I decided I wanted to swim to lose weight and get back into shape. Hers were great so I ordered a pair of my own and every time I go to swim (5-6 times per week) I use these to help my workout and improve my freestyle kick. I see many people at the pool where I go to work out using these fins and they are all happy with them. I am so glad I got the fins as yesterday I was so happy to swim one mile for the first time in one month. These fitness fins have really helped me improve my workout...get a pair...you'll love them!
5,great product,"These are great fins, at least from the perspective of a beginning lap-swimmer. I only use them for warm-ups, and they've worked great. Transaction experience with the seller was fine."
2,"ok, but there a risk of them to fall of your foot if not very tight","Fins are ok, but the buckle which holds them on your foot is of a rotating ""hook"" design, which means that if for some reason the tension is not too high, the hook may turn and coupling rod will escape through the hook opening thereby unlatching the buckle and the fin may slip off your foot if you don't catch it with your hand in time. The fin should work in theory if tension is high enough and the buckle feels tight and snag on your foot. I had to catch one fin once when I was swimming with them for the first time. I see it as a design flaw. The fin should never be able to slip off the foot, even if the strap becomes loose. It would be devastating if it happens in the open sea, and slightly embarrassing in the swimming pool."
5,Very pleased with the item,My training fins are fun to use and I can definitely feel the whole back of my legs getting more exercise.
5,East/West,"The liner notes are in Japanese, so I'll give a brief description:This release marks the first CD issue of two LPs. Tracks 1-7 were originally issued as ""Cool C"" MUSE LP 5245 (1981), and find Cole fronting an all-Japanese big band. Track 8 is from the same sessions with just a rhythym section. Tracks 9-12 are the Japan-only LP ""Tokyo Madness"" (a live recording also made in 1981) with Bruce Forman (guitar), Smith Dobson (piano), Marshall Hawkins (bass), and Scott Morris (drums). Marshall Hawkins really rips through ""Cherokee.""It's good to see any Richie Cole in print, so this gets 5 stars. The Japanese attention to sound quality is evident throughout. While not my first choice of Richie Cole releases (""Alto Madness"" and ""Hollywood Madness"" are better), nonetheless worth purchasing while it's still available."
4,a great travel companion,"This is the perfect book to take along on a trip to the Middle East. Saves hours of research on the history of western religions.Dalrymple's stuborness in getting places even when it puts others at risk can sometimes be exasperating and he has fairly firm opinions on muslims, christians and jews but his writing is witty and fluid and it is a pleasure to share in the excitement of his travels and benefit from his extensive knowledge of religions,art and history."
2,Disappointing,"being a fan since the pentecost 3 days, i have seen this band undergo quite transformation, most of which has been very good. I love alt4 and think judgement an underrated album, but a fdte really sounds like a band that does not know what to do next. I feel it to be comepletely without emotion. Its almost like they have given up and are just making music to make musicit is possible to make the transition from metal to rock, and keep all the emotion and integerity of being honest musicians(just listen to katatonia and you will understand)i honestly can not reccommend this album to anyone."
5,thank you....,"....to whatever inside my head convinced me to buy this cd. for months i would pass this album wondering if i should try it(not having heard anything by this band previously). I finally picked it up a few days ago, and what can i say? This is one of the most beautiful, moving, serene and dark albums i have ever bought in my life. while i would say im a pretty big metal head, i could not resist the mellow and haunting soundscapes of this album. The title track alone could carry this cd. do your soul a favor and buy this, NOW."
4,Underrated album from an underrated band,"Listening to this album for the first time in 2008, having pretty much ignored it on discovering Anathema years previously, I can say it's a damn fine piece of work! It rocks out; it has mellow moments and has those memorable Anathema melodies that'll have you humming for days. Criticism of A Fine Day as the disappointing follow up to Judgement is unfair. As a stand-alone piece of work this album is streets ahead of the offerings of most of the current batch of popular rock bands out there."
4,the new one,"the new release from englands anathema and a strong one atthat.it took a couple of listens for this one to grow on mejust like the last cd.gone for good are the death growlsfrom this band.a very mature sounding cd at that.some strongsongs looking outside inside,panic and underworld.would istill call anathema a metal band...yes a damn good one"
4,A strong collection with a few really good interviews,"It is almost impossible to please everyone with a collection. Why was this poet included? Or you included him/her and didn't include this poem... Are you insane? The benefit of an anthology is that it can introduce the reader to poets that they may otherwise never come in contact with. To that end, I am thankful to Moyers for introducing me to the work of James A. Autry and Lucille Clifton. I also enjoyed many, but not all, of the interviews. This was a good book. If you are interested in poetry but aren't sure where to start, this collection will introduce you to a wide variety of styles. I am sure you will find something you like, and it will be worth the effort."
2,"dull, maudlin romanticism","Bill Moyers is an admirable thinker, so one must be careful to distinguish that the low quality and worth of the ideas in this book are attributable to the poets, not to Moyers himself. Almost all of the poets express themselves in the usual vague and cliched generalities of what they conceive poetry to be -- ""Life,"" ""Soul,"" ""Eternity,"" ""Love,"" ""Beauty,"" etc. Of all the poets interviewed here, only Adrienne Rich (a poet with whom I have many aesthetic differences) sounds as if she has a head on her shoulders. It's no coincidence that the poets represented here also write terrible poetry, again with the exception of Rich."
3,Poetry for Dummies,"A worthy read, if you are looking for a general intro into modern poetry. Probably better off just buying a good poetry anthology, though. Few things can be as tiresome as poets yammering on about poetry. Does a terrible job highlighting the works of truly experimental and avant garde writers. Clearly the poets were chosen as much on their accessibility as they were their talent. Gods forefend if one might actually have to think their way through a poem, or - gasp! - not understand it!"
1,puzzle,"This was very difficult. I belong to a Jigsaw puzzle exchange club and do hundreds of puzzles a year. This was not fun. It was almost all the same color and the pieces were cut in such a way that the writing didn't even help. It ended up just being ""try every piece"". I wouldn't recommend it."
2,Try another book,"You will not learn anything new in this book that you don't already know. The book consists of 4 or 5 different essays written by 4 or 5 different authors. It isn't a clear book describing the civil war. I was looking for a book that described each of the reasons for the start of the civil war. This book didn't do that. Each essay tried to make a different point - but it was not clear. The book was too scattered for me. So if you want a more in depth, and more straight forward book about the start of the civil war - try another author."

4,"Always did like them. Sax and punk flavor, yow.","It's tough to get their original records. This 2xcd set brings together a ton of their music and most of it is just what yer lookin' for if yer into Essential Logic, gals creating funk based sax flavored punk attitude music. Nice, real nice. Glad I bought it. UK born music in a time of ESG & Delta 5, even Gang of Four. Think lighter James Chance & the Contortions. Sweet stuff folks."
1,Total crap!,"Good idea for a movie title, crap movie. Seriously stupid story, come on, you cant get a zombie story right? Girls wearing revealing cloths that do NOT look good in them. Damm guys."
3,"fair over-view, but not the best avaliable","This book is not bad if you want a quick over-view of Rawls. It's very readable and not terribly unreliable. But, it is also fairly superficial (it's hard to see how it could not be, given how short it is) and does not go in to significant depth as to any aspect of Rawls. The transition from A Theory of Justice to Political Liberalism is, in particular, given too little space. If all you want is a quick over-view of Rawls you can do worse, but if you want either a serious introduction or commentary you should look elsewhere. Jon Mandle's _What's Left of Liberalism_, Samuel Freeman's _Rawls_ (in the Routledge Philosophers series) or the _Cambridge Companion to Rawls_ are better choices."
5,Indispensable,"This is a MUST-HAVE for any serious collection of the Fathers; written and organized with exceedingly comprehensive style and economy by one of the premier scholars of Late Ancient Christianity. If you're determined to build your Christian library, get it without delay. If you're a true Origenist, you already have it."
1,I returned mine,"In the interest of full disclosure, this review was written by someone who didn't finish reading this book - not only was it of no use, parts of it were silly or offensive and I couldn't get through it. It speaks directly to the woman at all times, and seems to encourage her to avail herself of every single wedding trapping known to today's brides. I'd have preferred it if the author stuck to the topic of Jewish ritual, and not assume I need advice on a diamond, or choosing a caterer.There is so much extraneous stuff here, I forgot I was reading a book on JEWISH weddings. Tips on making sure children aren't in attendance? Please! How is that a Jewish ideal? Jewish weddings are community events!"
3,Mostly pleased.,The cards arrived very promptly -- Amazon is great at this -- but some of the envelopes were dog-eared.
4,An intense addition to the Fearless series.,"Loki will stop at nothing to get his hands on his ""perfect"" niece Gaia -- going under the name of Oliver, Gaia begins to get drawn to him because her life is falling apart. And Ella will stop at nothing to kill her. Defying Loki's orders, Ella is beginning to finally snap -- and her only comfort rests in her new friend, Pearl. But as Gaia decides to move on with her life, Ed and Heather's relationship becomes more serious, and Sam is depressed with his life. Nothing will prepare Sam for the blow that is about to come to him. Fearless #11: Trust was an exciting addition to the Fearless series, but not one of the best. This is the book where the characters begin to fall apart, and where enemies and friends merge and separate. However, Gaia acted a little naive, which was unusual of her. But I still thought this was a very exciting and thrilling read, though a little depressing sometimes."
2,Many different soul surviviving techniques!,"I got some encouragement and growth inspiring information from this book, and some was too deep for me. I prefer the simple soul learning, and tend to remember information to help me the more simple it is to apply."
4,Folk Sound,"I bought this because I wanted a CD with the song, ""The Lord of the Dance"" and it is the only one I can find with vocals. It's not what I expected, but I think the CD will grow on me. It's very Irish Folk sounding. This surprised me because these are church songs; but it's kind of cool anyway."
2,Terrible print for reading,I was terribly disappointed with the text size in this bible. Believe me I have other bibles. The text size is about a 6. I'm not kidding and the study notes are in faded black which makes it even worse to read. This study bible would be nice if they included a magnifying glass. If you must buy this bible please buy the LARGE print edition.
1,M L Smith,"This edition is a beautiful volume, and it is far more than I expected when I ordered a large print NIV study bible.An excellent resource, easy to use, and it would be a fantastic gift."
5,Most Helpful Bible I've Read!,"I have several Bibles, all with different helps. This is my favorite, with commentaries that apply to life today. The Life Application Bible is the most popular at the Bible Study Group I attend, because it often has the answers to the questions we ask. It is wonderful for newer Christians, but is just as important for those farther along in their Faith Walk. I highly recommend this Bible for anyone, and have purchased one for myself, as well as many as gifts. READ IT!"
5,For my research,"I find this to be a very good reference book. It is written so that I can understand it and points me in the direction I need to follow.Not only is this a spiritual guide, but it is a reference guide for those researching Biblical passages. A fine purchase it is!"
5,Wonderful!!,"I must say, this book is excellent! I hadn't purchased a new bible for over 20 years and after looking at my options, I'm very satisfied with this one. The large print and NIV is very easy to understand and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a new bible."
2,Bible,"This product was advertised as ""leather bound"" which led me to believe that it was genuine leather when it was actually ""bonded leather"". Bonded leather cracks on the edges after much use so that is not what I wanted. I wanted something that would stand the test of time."
2,NIV large print bible,It had had a name imprinted on the front and they had tried to scratch it out.I was disappointed still paying the $4o for it.
2,"large print, not large enough","I was disappointed in the ""large print"" of this purported large print bible. I got it for my mother who is 82 and enjoys reading but can only read large print books. granted this is larger print than your standard bible but not by much."
5,My Favorite Bible,I am so pleased with this bible. Very informative and explains so much more for me. The study area at the bottom of each page is perfect for learning deeper. And the large print is great for my eyes.
5,Revelation,This Bible offers a deeper interpretation of what you read from the actual text. It offers explanation of what went on and why it is important to you today. The introductions and main themes of the books are useful for additional background. The book itself is wonderful. The only negative is the leather cover it comes with. The leather should be of better quality.
5,FANTASTIC copy of the NIV LIFE APPLICATION STUDY BIBLE!,"I have a few other NIV Bibles but not one of them even comes close to this new LIFE APPLICATION STUDY BIBLE! I LOVE THE LARGE PRINT and all the other great information that is included in this bible. I ordered 2 more of the same bible for my grown up daughters ( 25 and 27) and they love them too! I wouldn't hesitate a minute about buying this WONDERFUL Bible! And not to mention the free shipping too! You can't go wrong...B. Long, San Clemente, Ca."
5,A wonderful translation and totally useful for anyone.,This is a tremendously interesting and fun way to read the bible. You could literally study the entire book -- without consulting another source -- and become biblically literate. I love this bible and find myself reading way more material than I otherwise would. It's superb! (P.S. The index is a must for the novice.)
5,Wonderful,I purchased this for my wife for Christmas and she loves it. She has read it nearly every night.
5,This book is a great source of spiritual guidance.,"I found this version of the bible to be as true to the original scriptures as possible. It uses current events and people to describe in a clearer way what certain passages of the bible are trying to relay. It also challenges you to actually think out your own opinion on what a passage means, and it helps you to apply this knowledge to your life.I found this version of the bible to be very easy to read, true to the original scripture, and all around a good source of knowledge on God."
4,Only One Dent In This Near Perfect Armor: ....,"it does not have the Words of Christ in red.I'm not quite sure what the publishers were thinking when making this decision especially in light of the fact that the regular sized bonded leather and regular trade editions of this study bible have Christ's words in red. This makes it a little bit harder to use in accessing what you need in the Gospels.Aside from that, this book is outstanding from the practical study notes to the charts to the intro to the extremely well done succinct character studies strewn throughout each book.I hope they update this, though, with Christ's words in red. That would make it as close to perfection as possible right now."
4,Not genuine leather,"I wanted to find a giant print NIV for my husband, and it was difficult to find anything close online. We went with this one, but it is bonded leather not genuine. Still, a good study Bible. And the type is quite large, I like the size of the print, my husband can read it if he forgets his reading glasses at home."
4,Where's the instructions,"This item arrived fine and works. I would love to have some instructions or at least descriptions on charge times. I heard from someone that this is a fast charger, but with no package or paperwork shipped, I am uncertain how fast it can charge my battery."
5,First rate vendor,I had a minor problem with the first charger I received. The vendor was quick to resolve the problem and ship a replacement device and allow me to return the original for full credit. I cannot recommend the vendor enough. The charger works fine except it has the same flaw that all Black & Decker chargers have - you have to monitor the charge cycle. It is not an intelligent charger. It will ruin your batteries if left in the charger too long. Just a gotcha from someone who has learned from bad experience.
1,DO NOT BUY FROM THIS GUY,"It has been 30 days since I ordered from this company. I haven't recieved any contact from the seller, the item I ordered, or the shipment confirmation. I tried contacting the seller two weeks ago, without hearing a thing back from them. Amazon should revoke this guy's account, and apparently I wasn't the first person to say that either. If you order from this guy you are going to get robbed, and then in thirty days you will be filling a claim with amazon to get your money back, which is what I just did."
3,Worked adequatly,I feel that product was mislabled. I needed it for the product listed but when I received it I had to modify it to make it work.
1,B & D (Firestrom) 24 volt dual battery charger,"I received the item in a reasonable amount of time but it didn't work. I don't believe there is anything wrong with my two batteries. Even though it was advertised to be a new product, the way it was packaged leads me to believe it is not new. I have e-mailed the seller but he has not responded. I would advise future buyers to beware.Black & Decker 5106551-20 CHARGER,DUAL 24VOLT"
5,An absolutely wonderful book.,"Life in the Treetops is an absolutely wonderful book. Please take a look at the customer and press reviews for the hardcover edition of this book. They are far more eloquent reviewers that am I. This book was on the cover of the New York Times Book Review. It was an Editors Selection in Scientific American and in New Scientist(UK. Because of the book, Dr. Lowman has been featured in German GEO, in Sydney Morning Herald, in Italian Elle and in Seoul Korea's daily, all in their own languages. She has been interviewed on NPR's Fresh Air Living on Earth and the BBC. You are wondering if all of this is important? It is when the book is a memoir. I found Dr. Lowman to be a role model for me and for my child. Please read it. It will be important to you."
4,Well-written account of a life in science,"Margaret Lowman is a gifted biologist with a knack for finding ways to teach others the importance of her field and the need for conservation. Her adventures range from the humorous to the frightening and are guaranteed to hold the reader's interest. I held off a five-star rating only because I would have liked a little more information on some of the animals she's studied. Her impressions of Nature's little-known and often-overlooked creatures are valuable and fascinating, and I wish more space had been devoted to them. That's a minor quibble, though. As a writer on nature myself, I came away from reading this book with an improved understanding of how complex the ""web of life"" is, not to mention a determination to get my own children out into the forests more often."
2,"I really wanted to like this one, but...","Margaret Lowman has undertaken some fascinating research on rain forest canopies, and she's also an excellent writer. So what's the problem? Well, she just can't stop using the phrase, ""As a woman in field biology..."" followed by some hardship that she endured in her career that she's certain was due to her gender. As a result, despite the fact that she is an accomplished scientist, this book is more about what she couldn't do than what she could."
4,An expansion that actually entertains...as long as you're lvl 30.,"This is definitely one expansion that gives you *almost* everything an expansion should give you. Tons of new areas and creatures, new job classes(3 in total). They're probably the most entertaining as well. The only thing it lacks is anything for anyone below the level of 30, being mainly no new race to play. Making an expansion that gives ALL players something new to do is generally the goal, but in this case they left out of of the major ones. Don't get me wrong, it's still a great expansion. Just expect to wait a while before you can take advantage of it."
5,Game of the Century,I got this game and have played the Final Fantasy online games for 8 yrs. its a good game and you have to pay monthly to play but I think its worth it 10 dollars monthly isnt too bad I will continue to but into the Final Fantasy name. great game
5,Awesome cover for the price!!!,"This is an excellent cover for the price. I have a scooter with a helmet box on the back and it fits perfectly. It has hooks on the bottom that keep the wind from blowing it off the bike. Initially,I just wanted a cover to keep the seat from being destroyed by the sun. But this cover also keeps the bike cleaner longer. Even if it doesn't last long for the price it's a bargin!!!Highly recommended!!"
3,Decent cover while it lasts,"This cover is pretty decent but after a year of usage, it has not proven it's worth. First off, the cover is not waterproof. During rains, water would tend to seep into the gas tank of my scooter. While the cover did provide some protection it was not enough during heavy downpours, which can be quite severe where I live. I do not have space in my garage so I was hoping this cover would at least provide some wind/sun resistance, which can become quite intense during the winter/summer. The cover tends to blow off no matter how much stuff the cover under the wheels. After six months it began to develop some tears where the ""breather"" holes are and eventually the whole thing just became shredded. After the storm that occurred on the 29th of June, the cover was no longer usable and was tattered. So while it lasted it did a pretty decent job but it just didn't hold up to all the hype"
3,"Great for drizzles, terrible in downpours.","I needed a cover for my new scoot and this was about half the price of the local dealership. I like it, it fits well over my scoot. I have to remove the rear cargo bin if I want it to fit below the frame, but otherwise it sits nicely. My only gripe, it's no waterproof. It's water resistant. Same material as a tent. In a few drizzles, it's great. Water beads right off. In long term rain like we've had here lately, two days in, and my scoot's got water on it. But for the money, it works."
5,Great Cover!,"I so was not paying attention to the size of this cover when I ordered it. I only have a 49cc Honda Metropolitan, so this cover covers it completely but it works great though.This cover defiantly protects your moped or bike in cold weather. It's frosted quiet a few times where I live and each time my bike doesn't have a layer of frost on it due to this cover.Great cover and product."
5,Great Cover!,This cover fit perfect and survived a major rain storm! I plan to buy another in the near future for another moped.
4,So Far So Good,"This review is for the large cover. It fit nicely over my Buddy scooter, plenty of room to spare. Unlike the photo on the listing, this cover goes over the front wheel of the scooter. Looks like it will be hard to squeeze it back into its ""handy"" attached carry case, but it's available for convenient transport nonetheless. We'll wait to see how it fairs over the winter."
2,Not very durable,Not very waterproof even in Texas & already has tears after only 6 months despite being well cared for & rarely used.
4,nice entry-level MP3 player for the price,"For $33.24 and free shipping, this product is a steal. I bought it as a gift and received many thanks. I think it's a nice entry-level MP3 player, the manual is very limited, however, the quality of music and voice recording is very good. I agree that 256 MB don't hold much, but then again, if you want a higher capacity MP3 player, you need to be prepared to spend a bit more. The MP3 player plugs directly into any USB port, which makes file transfer a breeze. Overall, not a bad MP3 player at all."
4,Good buy,"This is a cheap, small, flash mp3 player, which is exactly what I was looking for. (Basically I just wanted something so I wouldn't have to burn CDs all the time to listen to my mp3s.) The only drawback is that there is a backround buzz sometimes, but I have only heard this player, so I am not sure if that is standard in mp3 players. It's not overpowering, though, so it works."
5,Great product for the price.,"If you have never used this type of device, the instructions are very poor. The product itself is terrific. The sound quality is fantastic. It is very compact; and for me the 256 MB is the perfect size. I couldn't be happier."
1,It was terrible.,"I found this MP3 player to be very difficult and frustrating to use. The mode switch seemed to lock up on me at one point, making it impossible to access the submenus. I also had difficulties syncing music to the devic and when it managed to do so, skipped several tracks. Furthermore, I had a hard time following the online manual provided for the player and pretty much had to figure things out on my own. I am much happier with the MP3 player I got from a major discount store as it is more user friendly. I would not recommend the Mac Vision to anyone and am in the process of returning the one I bought."
1,Horrible-No stars!!,I was told by the manufacturer that you can only dowload unprotected music-this thing doesn't work anywhere that music is protected. I bought this for a child and am trying to return it. Russell at MacVision was unwilling to help. I would not recommend this unless you like breaking the law-dowloading illegal music.
5,Great little player,"I think it is a great little mp3 player, wish it came with more capacity (like 1 GB). I love it!"
1,stick with the name brands,"192 kbps wma had this thing stuttering. had to restart the songs a few times & finally it would play right, but there are intermittent pops & buzzes. The unit is also missing a 'lock' slider button. the voice record seems to work fairly well from the 2 clips I did.Do not be impressed by the price."
3,Decent Entry Level MP3 Player,"I entered the world of MP3 players relatively late. I had been among the first to buy a CD player back in the 1980's, but this Mac Vision is my first MP3 player. The short way to review it is to say you get what you pay for.......a decent entry level player that is not as versatile or user-friendly as an I-Pod or other more expensive player.It holds about the equivalent of 4 CD's. People will have to decide if this is enough for their needs. As for sound quality, most MP3 players don't vary that much. For those not familiar with this sound you should know that it is not quiet up to par with most portable CD players. Like most (even more expensive players) the headphones are very cheap. I think most people will want an upgrade. I use the Grado SR-80 with mine a lot. They cost $95, but I bought them to use at home too."
4,Good for the money,Well worth the money I paid (around $34 w/ free shipping) but the controls are definitely tough to get used to because almost everything is controlled by the one slider/button thing.
1,A pain in the Neck!!!!,"My 8 year old son got this for a Christmas present from his Aunt - spent too many hours figuring out how to get music onto to it. Ending up having to burn a CD from my library and then ripping it off the CD to download to the MP3 player - he will only have these same 20 songs on it forever. There's nothing like an Ipod - when I get a new one, I'll give him my old one and throw this Mac Vision one in the trash!!!!"
3,Homecoming: Reclaiming and Championing your Inner Child,"Homecoming: Reclaiming and Championing your Inner ChildIn this book Bradshaw (1992) who had PBS television series based on the major ideas of this book puts forth the theory of a ""Wounded Inner Child"". He hypothesizes that most of our interpersonal issues emerge and sustain because our inner child is wounded . Further, each one of us has this inner child wounded to some extent and each family is dysfunctional to a certain point.The author might be very right but I tend to disagree with this theory of inner child. The book contains exercises that you can take to see at what level of development your inner child got wounded and then ideas to put into practice for the healing of your inner child. The book might interest you if you have plenty of time on your hand."
3,A pretty darn good self-help book!,"This isn't a bad book - not at all! It's very helpful at helping one realize how events in childhood affect, no - form the person we are today. It has some very good exercises for getting in touch with one's inner child . .. I liked it, and found it useful. Worth the money and the time reading it -"
4,"Liked this go, Your Magic Garden: Discover your Life Work",If you liked this book Check out Your Magic Garden: A Guide to Discovering Your Life Work. Both books talk about the child within and how we can find our power and ourselves with our inner child. Your Magic Garden is an illustrated book for adults! It is about the difference between having a life and life having us. Check it out!
1,Writer Struggles With Own Unresolved Issues,"Recommended by a friend, the book has some valuable content; however, the author quoted a prayer he learned as a Catholic priest, only to follow it with his opinion that Mary was not a virgin. At that point, I closed the book and returned it to the library. To think I actually considered purchasing copies for my adult children..."
2,Lacking at the end,"The book starts out great but by the time the books gets to the championing portion, gone are the wonderful further explanations that existed earlier in the book. Sub-sections get only terse coverage with very little supporting helpful information. Unlike the rest of the book, every chapter of the championing section left me wanting more. It is as if the author lost energy for the last part of the book or has to cut material to make a publisher happy.Would be four stars if not for the weak championing section."
5,It's like you're really there!,"This book has so much detail to it, that at times it's almost overwhelming! The pictures that come with it are also very colorful and detailed. I loved the pull out cross section poster of the Titanic; I found it very interesting to look through and read about all the sections of the ship. This is a great book and I suggest it to all that enjoy reading and knowing about the Titanic."
5,THE BEST BOOK IN MY COLLECTION!,"This book has some sweet pictures,including the one where the water is pouring in the first-class staircase. VERY detailed, this book will bring you excitement from J. Bruce Ismay's conversation to the reaction people still have from the sinking."
5,Simple Brilliance,"""Cook For You"" may very well be the best electronic song that I have heard...Howie B proves that minimal sound can equate to brilliance"
5,A minimalist masterpiece,"I have to say one needs to have a well-developed ear to be able to appreciate such minimalism!!! A friend recently shared a quote with me and it goes like this: ""Collage is the paintbrush of post-modernism"". This album is a perfect example of sonic collage. When listening to ""Snatch"" I experience an artist who can only be honest with himself and not compromise his artistic integrity. I give it ten stars."
2,hideous,"Makes me want to pluck my eyes from my skull with a rusty spoon and jab dirty chopsticks into my ears repeatedly. That said, I gave it two stars as it truly takes ability and talent to make a movie this horrendous."
2,Poor fly design,"The tent is constructed well and is very esthetically pleasing but the problem is the fly only covers about 2/3 of the tent. The ends that aren't covered are very vulnerable to leakage and they do leak. I didn't have a problem with the seams but water coming through the material, and no nothing was touching the sides. They need to redesign the fly to fit more like the 1210. I traded up for the 1512 and am very happy with the new tent."
3,"OK, but there is better","We bought this tent after reading many reviews. I am an eagle scout and have experienced many tents!The 1610 has Positives and negatives:Positive:1) Easy & quick to assemble, takes 10 mins, due to 4 Poles!2) Good inner space, heightNegative1) The fly-sheet poles on the entrance break on first use. I have seen other complaints of this, and unless Eureka changes the design, the tent is completely flawed.2) The sides of the tent are not covered by the fly-sheet, and again a flawed design. When it rains, it seeps through the seams and zips. Yes, I used 4 cans, yes 4 cans of sealant, and it still rained in!Overall, easy to use tent, ok in mild weather, but unless Eureka changes the entrance fly-sheet poles, and redesigns the sides, it is a flawed product."
4,Overall a good tent,A lot of space for our family of 6. Loved the light weight and easy assembly. Be sure to apply water sealer on the seams. We tested it in the back yard before our trip and it leaked until we sealed the seams. Our 5 year old dropped one of the stakes inside the tent and put a hole in the floor for us that we also had to seal.
3,"big, could use a little improvement","great size for family camping, fit queen air mattress and 3 singles for the boys with some room left for gear. fiberglass poles I rate at just ok, small ones for rain fly broke after first use but they are way small so not overly supprised, looking for upgraded poles now and I'm sure it will be fine. Seal those seams, then seal them again when you notice a leak, ones you find it and seal it seams to be fine..."
5,Excellent in every way,"I sealed the seams as soon as I received my tent a couple years ago and have to say it's great in most every way. I was camping and up comes a huge thunder storm. 30mph winds and even the rainfly was left unharmed. The poles did bend a bit, as they are flexible to begin with, but the tent kept me dry and out of the storm for the first 4 days of my camping trip. I always use a floor saver as well so that not only does the tent receive more protection from rips in the floor, but it gives an extra layer of defense again ground moisture. Ventilation is great on the tent also but there is still normally some condensation within the tent each morning, at least in cooler weather anyway. I use a dual mantle coleman lantern so each morning I light it until the moisture has gone. I recommend this tent because I own it and have used it extensively. Best wishes to you all."
2,You get what you pay for.,"This would be a good tent for casual camping in non-inclement weather. The rain fly tore in the area of the tie down string during a minor wind storm. The string was not too tight, but the added stress of the movement caused the whole seam to tear away. Also, I doubt 9 people would fit in this tent. Find a better tent if you plan to camp in weather and find a bigger tent if you need to fit a lot of people."
1,The Eureka product is of very poor quality. And zero customer service.,"I bought the tent, Eureka, because of its high quality and reputation. To my surprise the flytop tore during its first use. When we woke up the flytope was torn for no apparent reason.My major disappointment is not just about the quality of the tent nor that a tent, costing $220, only lasts a single day.For me the most incredible and frustrating aspect of this affair is that I have written more than 15 emails to the email address camping@johnsonoutdoors.com asking for the guarantee, asking them to sell me another flytop, and I have sent photographs but I have not received A SINGLE RESPONSE. NOTHING.Fifteen days have now passed and no-one has responded to my correspondence.The Eureka product is of very poor quality.And ZERO customer service."
4,seal the seams!,"easy to pitch, great space, with the option of making it into three rooms. we had queen-size mattresses at each end and still had plenty of space in the middle for whatever. and the bathtub floor worked fine, but ... i wish i'd sealed the seams on the sides of the tent, as the minute it started raining hard, there were leaks that produced little puddles at the bottoms of the major seams not well-covered by the fly (mostly the ends). door and window zippers work well and the various gear lofts are very handy. bottom is pretty thin, so be SURE to lay out a tarp underneath to protect it from damage. once i get those seams properly sealed, this will be a nice summer car camping home-away-from-home."
5,Print Tabs work great!,"I use the print tabs and they work great! Disappointed that they are not available locally and the cost of shipping pushes the price up to make me consider not purchasing them. But after using them, I would buy again!"
5,AWESOME,"I have been looking for these EVERYWHERE and finally found them!! They are awesome because they are very easy to print on and may be used as single-sided inserts or double-sided inserts. They are incredibly inexpensive, and WELL worth your dollar!!"
5,Labels are fine. Don't buy them from Promax Supply,"The labels are fine and almost ridiculously cheap. But let the buyer beware of sellers like Pro-Max who charge exorbitant shipping costs (in my case, nearly 6 dollars), and then don't deliver on time. If you want to buy these labels -- and why not? they're good -- just be sure to check out the seller first. Most of Amazon's sellers are great -- but there are some, like Pro-Max, who can not be trusted."
3,Get Awat From Her,"In answer to your question... it's performed by Jay G w/ Troy Horne and Adam 12. Music helped the movie a lot but my favorite song was ""Back In The Eighties."" Might even be worth buying the CD for."
3,Question...,"I really like a lot of the songs but there is one missing in my opinion. The song that is played when Sarah and Matt are fighting. It goes ""Get Away from her"" if anyone can tell me who sings this or the title i would love that! thanks."
2,the real cancun sound track,does any 1 no tha name of or where i could get tha song when jus b4 tha wet t-shirt contest starts and its got like symphony playing then it starts jumping?? write 2 elemenohphee_0@hotmail.com if any 1 nos??
4,song?,what is the name of the song when the guy who took his first shot (forget the name) starts playing in the background whats the name of the song that starts playing?
4,I need your help!,"I love the CD but need the Name of the song playing during the credits and shows the band playing (""get sticky, sticky""). It is important I get it. Please help!=)"
3,Anyone??,"the last night at the congo bongo a band plays a song that goes...""what do i have to say to get inside girl"" or something along those lines...it's more or less punk rock, with some heavy and light sides to it...if you know what i'm talking about please respond!~thanks~"
5,need a name for a song,"Whats the name of the song they played at the end, just as the credits were rolling? I have the soundtrack but its not on there! Thanks"
3,Songs,What is the heaps Bassy song where the guys come out individually and strip down to their undies? That song is awesome!!!
3,Only 4 years later!,"I finally found the song I set out in search of 4 years ago. The band is called The Blank Theory, and the song is Invisible. The incredibly ironic thing is I think they are no longer an existing band, haha. Well, check out their CD. It is pretty good, but not great. Invisible is worth the cost of a used CD though. I thought the Real Cancun Music crew really dropped the ball on filling in everybody about the music they included in the movie. I hate it when the soundtrack doesn't have the songs that you buy it for. Luckily we fixed that problem in the late 90s with downloading."
3,OK sound but CDs freeze,"I was perfectly happy with this mini system until about three months after I purchased it. Suddenly all of my CDs began to stop dead in the middle of a song. We're talking brand new CDs here. It doesn't happen at any specific point in a given CD, just randomly. Other times it stops momentarily and then continues. When I try to eject the frozen CD it won't even open unless I bang hard on the unit, which I'm sure doesn't help the problem! I tried various laser lens cleaners and it still happened. I contacted Aiwa and they told me I had to SEND the unit to a place in upstate New York and wait an indefinite period for them to repair it. I don't expect much for $... but I do expect more than 3 months use out of a system."
3,Bare Minimum,"This grill performs its necessary functions adequately... it cooks food. Assembly was relatively easy. The construction of the burner assembly was slightly out of whack- the burner mechanism was slightly tilted to one side, resulting in extremely hot cooking on one side and low flame on the other side- had to jury-rig the burner assembly to get it close to level. Gas flow was inconsistent and hard to control. Overall... it'll cook your food, but not a very well constructed grill. You get what you pay for."
5,Great grill for the price but needs a few upgrades.,"I bought this grill because it had been on sale and my budget was tight. I have had it for some time now and recently added a rock holder/drip grate ($12.00) ceramic heating titles ($10.00) and a cast iron grill ($27.00) and wow this baby can cook. I was only so so happy with it before, but with an extra $50 dollar I feel I have a first rate grill that sears and grills with the best of them. The titles and drip rack gave me an even heat and the cast iron holds heat very well. My next addition will be a rotisserie. Overall for the money you get a decent grill that does about everything with out the extra knobs, dials of the fancier ones."
3,Not as good as I thought,"It's a high quality mic but honestly it's not as powerful as I thought it would be. Also it's battery powered if you don't have phantom power but there's no indicator so you can't know when it's dead. The mic is good, you just need a really high qualiy capturing device to use it."
2,very loud buzzzzzzzzzzzzz hum,"i know this isn't a $1000 but I have both the NTG2 and the Rode VideoMic. The VideoMic does NOT make any hum noise. This NTG2 does. I have to cut the overall volume in half to remove the hum. I would have to say, the volume cut in half sounds better than onboard mics on cameras.I tried the mic on the camera (HMC70) and off the camera. I tried using AA and no-AA Phantom power. I tried attenuation. I tried on other camcorders. really bad BUUUUUUZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZI bought this for better sound but sounds worse. I guess I will have to return and get the more recommended NTG3 or 416 someday."
1,horrible,I bought this mic and the recording quality is much worse than the factory mic that came with my Sony PD 170 digital video camera. I get a low feedback noise on the recording when using the mic and the pickup is terrible. I sent it back.
2,Excuse me?,"I would actually just like to know how the reviewer below considers this a ""warning to women who are abused""?? A very curious comment."
2,"BORING, Ho-hum, no suspense.","B O R I N G. From the beginning of the book, you know all the plot, what there is of one (not much, other than a killing), and the little incidental aspect of the husband's transvestite habits, which has nothing to do with the story, actually.I am a true crime reader from way back, and feel I know the good ones from the pounded-out ones. This one lacks any spark, any suspense, and I am disappointed in the reviewers on this page who steared me to buy it. It has been damn hard just to finish."
1,Twisted,"The author who wrote this book had no idea what they were writing. I never thought I would believe that someone would attempt to change the story to make it better but this is one of them. You should be ashamed writing all these lies just to make it more ""fascinating"". This is a sad story that had a very bad ending. This should not have been written as a horror story. Get your information correct before writing anymore rubbish."
1,much to be desired,"Left facts that would interfere with the opologetic view of history out. No historian would try as hard to excuse Franco's crimes and leave much of the truth to the imagination of the reader.Much research, that should have been included was left out, for whatever reasons. There are other books much more definitive of what Franco really was."
2,"""Chaotic musings, self-absorbed, narcistic""","I had to chuckle at the words in my title quoted from other reviews here. Couldn't say it better.I'd add self-indulgent.I fly through a cracker-jack war novel or work of nonfiction. I slogged halfway through this one and gave up.I only rated it two stars becasue I always suspect ""one-star"" people of ulterior motives!"
2,Very Slow Paced.,"I have a collection of over 360 war books besides all the ones I have read in 74 years as a student of Military History. I started on this book with great expectations, but soon found it hard to keep up intrest. I begain to read every third or fourth page. I do not recomend this book to anyone that has read very many nonfiction war books on any of the modern wars. It's just too offbeat."
5,Reality of the troops,"Ganttner pieces this book together from notes and personal memory after the war. It is as disjointed and at times confusing as it must have really have been. The reality of war, the sensation of killing another human being, the shock of being caught in an explosion, the confusion, the loneliness. Gantter captures these details very well and his writting style is simple and descriptive. One of the best first person accounts I've read. Gives a better sense of continuity of an individual soldier than an Ambrose book, including the boredom of being a soldier at times. Gantter doesn't tout himself a hero, which makes the times and events he writes about even more heroic!"
5,Ive read it cover to cover 4 times!,"Ramond Gantter's ""Roll Me Over, An Infantryman's World War II"", is truley a wonderfull book. I have read it from cover to cover 4 times, and im working on my 5th. It includes reflection upon one mans thoughts and soul, as well as cant-put-the-book-down-action. It is a very powerfull book. So much so, when i get a snack, i feel lucky to be able to munch on what ever, instead of a D-bar, or C rations."
5,One of a Kind,"Possibly the finest combat memoir ever written, ""Roll Me Over"" easily ranks alongside the works of veterans who went on to become professional writers, such as William Manchester's ""Goodbye, Darkness"", or David Kenyon Webster's ""Parachute Infantry."" Mr. Gantter's work has a remarkable day-by-day continuity to its narrative that is not found in other works, most memoirs are as confused and disjointed as only a battlefield can be. Sometimes an absolute gem awaits discovery in the bargain bin!"
5,Wonderful History - man in nursing home,I was asked to purchase this book for a gentleman in our nursing home. He requested this book because he was the character in the book named Shorty and he was there in 1944 and knows the author.He is thrilled to have this book.Thank you.
3,Moderate @ best,"Unlike the previous review by Brian..i was disappointed in the way this was filmed. I have been a DJ for 15 years and have been going to these shows for almost all of my life. The acts on this disk are enuff to leave even the most critical veterans of arena dance/live dj shos stunned...HOWEVER..the filming is amateur @ best and the quality is shoddy. I have a sony home theater system and this shoul have been a blitzkreig of phenominal music and sound. IT WASNT. There isnt enough focus on the Dj's or them doin what they do best...MIXING..Obviously BRIAN is just another candy raver who is easily entertained.Im sure you can find him @ a local gadzooks store buying his "" Raver in a box"" club gear. If you truley want the experience of being there..@ any live massive show..try www.grooveradio.com or www.moonshine.com or www.djmixed.com and check out what they have to offer. PLUR JEf"
2,"Not good enough, don't be fooled by the hype","I really enjoy most of Stephen Hunter's work but something always bugs me when I'm reading him. His characters are flat, his dialogue is sparse and stupid and he always, always uses dumb characters to prove his point. ""Black Light"" would have been great if the story would have stayed with the invesigation of Sheriff Swagger not the time-jumping story between Bob Lee's vengeance and the Jimmy Pye murder spree. It is a very confusing book which I refused to finsih. If you want good Stephen Hunter read his book of film reviews or ""Point Of Impact"". Forget the ""Bob Lee"" trilogy and read Tom Clancy's early stuff instead."
2,If you suffer from insomnia.....,"Bearing this book an appealing cover with so many great recommendations from prestigious authors I expected much more for my moneyHunter made the effort but could not conceive a story good enough to reflect the compelling recommendations he has achieved to promote his work.Throughout the chapters I could not find smart twist and turns, bogus elements and other subterfuges that can wake up a sleepy reader. To make it worse, I also found a poor employment of language and the ending did not score to make out for the flabby plot."
3,A let down,"Its hard for me to write this because I love reading Stephen Hunter. But this book just didn't do it for me. There was not much action (At least compared to ""point of impact"" and ""time to hunt""). Also, the way bob lee handled some situations was not true to his form. His legendary Skill and Stone cold confidence was lacking. Over all i was bored with this book and the few exiting times were overshadowed by unbelievibility and too much luck in getting him out of his binds he always seems to get into. Some of the action sequences could go strait into and an Arnold Schwarzenneger movie without missing a beat. One last thing....Hunter is known for going into detail about everything, even if its not pertinant to the story, which is fine, but he may have gone overboard this time."
4,twists and turns,"The ending surprised me, even though I thought I had everything figured out. Hunter's characters come alive, and Bob Swagger becomes the type of guy you would like living next door to you. His American machismo is bold and refreshing. My only problem with the book came in the precious detail paid to gun and firing accessories. I had no idea what he was talking about, even though I probably should have. I suppose much of it was important to the plot, but all the background on the black light and those who perfected it probably bogged down the plot, rather than aided it. All in all, powerfully written and a great read--especially for a man."
3,Take no prisoners hunt,"Earl Swagger, a respected Arkansas State Trooper, was gunned down by paroled convict Jimmy Pye in 1955. Forty years later, the explanations for the violent moment still aren't satisfactory: Was Earl's death linked to a murder case he was working on? When a young journalist convinces reclusive Vietnam veteran and former sniper Bob Swagger to help him reinvestigate the story.Nicely spans the decades and leads to a take-no-prisoners hunt."
4,Semper Fi!!,It is really a joy to be able have a starting point for a main character. The illutions that are made in further books now have meaning and understanding. I've decided to read all his books before my passing.
3,worth reading but not his best (Swagger) work,"After setting a very high standard with ""Point Of Impact"" and ""Dirty White Boys"" this book could not completely fulfil the expectations I had when I started it.Even if the plot and its conclusion is not the best in my opinion, this book is again well written and entertaining.It also builds an interesting bridge between the formerly mentioned books by actively linking the history and fate of Bob Lee Swagger and his farther Earl.If you want to know the whole story you just will have to read this book as well."
4,bob lee strikes again,"very typical hunter - good shoot-em-up. well paced and interesting with good twists, fairly predictable plot line and outcome -but still a definate page turner, and very enjoyable-the only negative is a propensity towards totally gratuitous cursing -which serves no purpose except to offend needlessly."
4,Hunter is Awesome,"This book is very good but I recomend you read Point of Impact first, It will make more sense to you then. Also if you want the ending to be as much of a shock as he meant it to be then read Dirty White Boys before Black Light too. However if you are only going to read one of these first then stick to Point of Impact."
4,Black Light,"Stephen Hunter's ""Black Light"" is an action thriller that is difficult toput down. Bob Lee Swagger, the character in ""Point of Impact"", becomes interested in his father's death which occurred many years earlier. It becomes clear that Earl Swagger was killed by a sniper and not in a shootout with the Pry boys as thought. Who killed him and why? There are powerful people in the plot that do not want that known. You will have to read the book find out.Point of Impact is now available on DVD as ""The Shooter"". Black Light with its action and suspense would have you on the edge of your seat if it were made into a movie."
3,black light,"i've never read any of stephen hunter's books before, so i'm not exactly sure how this compare to his other stories, but i do know that if they are like this one, i'm not in a hurry to read them. the book full of details. details about EVERYTHING. it tends to drag a bit from all the details. the last quarter of the book, when bob lee and russ actually start to stuff other than drive and read, starts to get a bit better.i will admit though, at the end of the book, all of the details from the beginning are important. if you were paying attention to them, you'll be able to spot a few hints as to who killed bob lee's father. the ending is a real shocker though, just when i thought i had it figured out, i was all wrong. i believe that even if you pay strict attention to ALL the details, you will still be surprised."
4,Lit up,"This story had more of a mystery element than 'Dirty White Boys' which made it interesting.I like Hunter's stories and I agree that they have all been good, though not too deep.Black Light is one of his better ones."
3,A book that will keep you guessing until the very end.,"The anticipated sequal to Point of Impact may not have the same steam, but the conclusion makes up for it. The gun fights in this book can't help but remind you of Rambo and his never-ending supply of bullets. Nevertheless, Black Light is a compelling read that will tug at your emotions. A must read for Bob Swagger fans. If you are a first timer to the world of ""The Nailer"" I suggest going with Point of Impact before you hit Black Light."
4,"Exciting, but flawed","Mr. Hunter returns for a third visit to the world he created for ""Point of Impact,"" and ""Dirty White Boys."" Like the first two books, this was a jargon filled, harsh, violent book filled with action. However, Mr. Hunter, like so many authors before him, failed in his research; Marines do not call for ""Medics"" when injured, they yell for a ""Corpsman."" Other than this and a few other minor but irritating flaws, this was a good, entertaining read"
3,Get your fill of a manly man book,"I've read a few of Hunter's books now and felt that this one veered into the testosterone laden land that Lee Child's characters venture into, as well.The book was interesting, but not as strong as _Point of Impact_. And, was it just me or was Swagger depicted as more of a stereotypical hillbilly in this book compared to POI?Overall, the Hunter books are definitely guilty pleasure reading books that I'll read in a day or so."
2,Much of the text is verbatim from the papers,"I just want to comment that much of the text comes verbatim from the papers cited in the references. At first, I thought that was fine because it appeared only to be from the authors' papers, which are heavily cited, naturally. Then I located one that was not written by the authors. The theory, results, and conclusions were literally lifted off that paper and put into their book (with citation). The same has been true of almost every single paper that I have read referenced from this book.The references get five stars. The book gives almost no new information, hence the two stars."
1,Same writer reviewed book 4 times!,"I depend upon the Amazon reviews to help determine whether to purchase a book as most others do. When a reviewer posts four 5 star reviews of the book (out of 7 total) it biases the rating and makes one wonder whether if the reviewer has an agenda or is related to the authors. This may be a great book, but I have no confidence from the rating given here."
1,how bad can it get?,"the newest version of systemworks is a horror. i will never buy this product again. it get's worse and worse. live update never completes (never had this problem with previous versions). try to get some help - forgedaboutit.please, don't make the same mistake i did."
1,Total Disaster !,"I have used Norton products since the MSDOS days, and this is the first time I've ran into such poor execution and support. Usually Ican load a Symantec product and have nothing but good results.DO NOT USE GoBACK... make sure you do a custom install and avoid GoBack. My mistake was trusting Symantec, and had to rebuild my whole machine... many hours, days wasted. Their Tech Support, if you can call it that, is non existent.Once you've installed it it freezes your machine when it trys to boot.GoBack should be called Go to H*llI would give this a -5 if I could."
3,Something is wrong with Norton,"When I installed Norton SystemWorks Premier 2006, it was working for a few days and then Windows Installer says it cannot find the things to run it. I still have it installed, but everytime I try to open up something by Norton (the software I have installed), I have to press ""Cancel"" on the windows installer until it decides to run."
1,Mission Critical: Mission Failure,Activation issues are plaguing our computers. My gosh! Who is running Symantec. How do you screw up a sure thing?
3,Mixed Impression,"I purchased Norton SystemWorks 2006 Premier as an upgrade from 2003 Pro. My primary motivation was an upgrade of the Ghost module. I expected the upgrade to offer a better version of Ghost and was disappointed. It's become so automated it has become crippled. The rest of the product was okay. No problems during installation and it functions acceptably. Of course, I didn't install GoBack. I learned my lesson from previous versions. If I had it to do over, I would've just used 2003 and extended my virus coverage."
1,Will the downhill road end for norton?,"I've gone through several versions of norton antivirus and internet security. It seems every year they just throw some software in a box and slap a price on it. Gets worse every year too. This time I decided to try system works and wow. Talk about BS. It did install ok, but it really slowed down my computer. I'd say about 35-45% of my speed is gone. It has added about 6-8 processes to my system. Most annoying part is that it strapped itself to the boot process, adding yet another screen I need to see while computer starting up. I hate that we can't seem to get enough truthful reviews to help us purchase the best antivirus software. I would love to throw my money at another company with better software, or should I say worthy software. Who can you trust? And which software?"
1,Norton System Works 2006 Not compatible with my System,Once this product was installed I could no longer boot the system - symantec tech support was not only slow ( and there was no cost free support) but ineffective. I had to rebuild the entire system. Win2000 was my operating system - I have now upgraded to XP and have returned the software. Just a note I had been a user of Norton System Works for a number of years previous.
1,Don't buy it!,My first experience with System Works was in 1999 with Windows 98 and what a system saver it was for a few years. WinDoctor would take care of blue screens and errors and Speed Disk was an awesome and fast defrag tool. But SW 2006 is the 1st version I have tried with Windows XP and after only one day I am going to try to return it. Windows XP seems to have all the tools I need and this software is just slow and redundant. I wished I had read these reviews before I purchased it but with the $50 dollar rebate I thought I couldn't go wrong. Wrong!!
2,Very long time to scan,"Having owned Norton products for fourteen years now, this has got to be the worst upgrade yet. Full Scan takes me at least six or seven hours, not because of the 1024 mg of ram, but the program is the slowest yet. One plus, if you don't mind waiting forever, is that it's a very good program based on it's utility ability. Uses up a bunch of system memory. Very, Very slow!!"
5,Norton's the bomb!,"Norton has always had premium products. I have been using them for several years and have never had a problem. This version has been updated and pretty much manages itself. It includes Norton Ghost, which has saved me a couple of times from having to completely rebuild my computer due to a bad software install."
4,Norton Systemsworks Works,"I have read that others have had problems with this software. However, I've been using for several years without a hitch. It updates itself and works in the background. I found it to be effective and as advertised."
1,Wiped out system,"NEVER NEVER NEVER NEVER buy this product! I installed in on my new laptop and as soon as it was done and said ""reboot"", my system went into a NEVER ENDING reboot cycle. I thought I had something on my computer that caused my problem. After reloading Windows XP Pro, I decided to make it the first software I would add, no other software conflicts. SAME THING, REBOOT LOOP, OVER AND OVER AND OVER. How can they sell this kind of garbage? I used 2003, 2004. Could NEVER get 2005 to install, alway an error message half way through. Maybe that was a blessing. 2006 WIPED OUT MY COMPUTER. DO NOT BUY AND DO NOT EXPECT SUPPORT WORTH A ....Support call put me in India to a person who could not get the spelling of my name and I could not understand her.DO NOT BUY UNLESS YOU WANT TO WASTE TWO DAYS RECOVERING YOUR SYSTEM."
1,Careful with this one...it may kill your computer.,"I have been buying Norton products since the mid 90's with no major problems until now. Goback included in System Works 2006 has prevented my computer from booting resulting in my having to reformat my computer. Fortunately it was a brand new computer and I lost only time, not data. However in the process I learned that Symantec has no product support! I have been waiting for 24 hours for a Paid(29.95)call back and it's not happened. Luckily I have a second computer and was able to search the web for help on this and it's not an uncommon problem. If it were free I wouldn't use it, because I paid for it I am furious. If you have a RAID drive stay away from this, if you have more than 1GB of memory, Stay away from this!Heck, stay away from this period. This had been a reliable product but it is now crap with no support!"
1,Kiss system performance goodbye!!!,"Generally speaking, as a provider of AntiVirus software, Norton has been more reliable than Mcafee. GoBack, however, is an abomination. As other reviewers have noted, start up time will increase by two or three magnitudes of order. There are background processes that constantly run that kill performance and response time. It also creates a documented problem when trying to add a secondary hard drive with GoBack installed, to a new computer. The secondary hard drive will not be recognized under ""my computer"" (rendering it totally useless). The workaround? Disable GoBack! The solution? Don't by this piece of junk software in the first place."
3,NSW Premier needs help !,"I have by now installed and uninstalled at least 4 to 6 times. Doesn't install well over previously upgraded products (antivirus), also Goback will not install if your harddrive was initially setup with drive manger software (Maxblast or the like) and you don't know this until the installation fails, then you need to download the 3 uninstall tools from Symantec and run them as instructed. Does not seem to coexist well with NIS 2005. My last install was NWS 2006 w/o Goback or Antivirus and then to install NIS 2005, this has lasted for two weeks."
1,Ripoff--Disable ware,"Don't buy software you pay good money for only to have it disabled! If I had known this was going to be disabled prematurely, I would have never had bought it.After getting an error message that the subscription was invalid, I call support and was told the software subscription was up despite the fact that I still 4+ months left on the subscription renewal.All I asked for for was the entire year subscription I purchased 11/7/2005 and am able to use the product (System Works 2004) until that time. I think that's reasonable, legitimate and legal as there was no agreement that I would have purchased another product to have the registration time applied to the product.Now the product is disabled and EVERY service is disabled as well. That means, no virus scan, no disk doctor--nothing. Every service is disabled and the software is useless."
3,Makes hard drive chatty,"Difficult to figure out how to shutdown NAV so it will not interfere with installs.Makes my 80GB hardrive very chatty for much as 30 minutes after booting or coming out of hybernation, even after defgrag.Otherwise acceptable. I would be overwhelmed without a system repair tool like Norton."
1,No Need to Buy this Product,"It does nothing that other software, either bundled with Windows or free from Microsoft or other sources can't do. The antivirus can be purchased stand alone if you really want it.Norton is an unfriendly company; their customer service is not particularly helpful; their software is difficult to activate; try to reinstal it ""too many"" times because of hard disc failure and they will lock you out from activating permanently.A one star review is appropriate."
1,Buyer Beware,"I purchased Norton Systemswork Premier. I used it without difficulty for several months. Then one afternoon (19-Nov-2006), I started getting an error message everytime an application requested a virus scan. The message indicated that Norton was trying to configure itself and said that msi files must be run from setup. I tried to uninstall Norton, but the uninstall failed. From that point on, every file that I tried to open was judged to be infected. A very important MSWORD file was deleted as were my .dot files. My computer became virtually unusable. Norton Systemworks Premier is worse than a virus. I would have given this product zero stars, but one is the minimum allowed."
4,Still going strong...,"Jeez, ya'd think you'd be able to totally write these old geezers off as yesterday's news by now... But even this late in the game, the Fairporters are as capable a folk outfit as you're likely to find. This compact, four-piece edition of the band includes Simon Nicol and Dave Pegg, joined by guitarist Maartin Allcock and fiddler Ric Sanders; they open with a perky gypsy jazz number, and drift into a pleasant mix of trad and earnest folkie material. The second half of the disc is a live show recorded in December, '95... The whole album has a crispness and clarity of purpose that may surprise you! Don't be fooled by the unimpressive cover art; this is a disc well worth checking out."
3,"A good read, engaging and excellently developed.","Bloodwinter has all of the elements of a good fantasy book. Warriers, reluctant magician (although this first book does not really ackowledge that), great odessey's, and enough subplots to keep the reader wondering what will happen next. After I was done with the book I wanted to purchase the next installment, which has not been published yet. My only complaints with the book are that some of the relationships do not ring very true, and that the author seems to pull rabbits out of a hat to either save characters or cause them problems."
4,Pretty Good,"It took me almost seven weeks to finish this book. I liked it, but in some parts it is so boring that you just have to skip the chapter. Sometimes you can read forever and understand practically nothing about what is going on. Others, however, can be very exciting and well worth the read. I think there are too many characters, though. Sometimes you have no idea who is talking, and it can get rather confusing. I found no point in the prologue. The characters in that chapter never returned again and you don't know who else dies, or what happens to them. After that chapter it goes straight into the main story, with totally new characters. I thought it was a good plot though, and can not wait to get a hold of the second book."
4,Very intriguing indeed!!!!!,"Tom Deitz has created a very intriguing new world in that of Eron and Ixti. The characters are very realistic and easy to sympathize with. Although this book may start off somewhat slow, it eventually becomes so engaging that I personally could not put it down! I look forward to reading more of this strange and utterly different land."
5,Unshakable...,"I am a Geisler fan, and reading this book for my classes at www.lru.edu was enjoyable, I would recommend this to anyone that is getting into the studies of Apologetics for sure. A keeper too."
2,Weak,"This book is really interesting, but it has very weak arguments. For example: it includes a lot of misunderstanding of the theory of evolution and the abiogenesis. It has also some misleading information about the the universe. However, talking about the history of jesus, it is interesting. But it covers the topic very briefly."
4,Fascinating but bizarre,A very fascinating memoir by a living Musical Theatre legend. The book does have x-rated parts which are more bizarre than titillating.
3,didn't really care for it... better shooters out there,"tried this one to see if i would like it enough to buy #2. i didn't care for this title. the super charged car you get to drive is cool and jacking other cars are cool, but if you suck at driving and accidentally hit your cop buddies, the cops will start shooting at you and coming after you. even if you are shooting the gangstas at that time, the cops will shoot you instead of the bad guys.. wth??you can't take cover against anything like you can in games like Mafia 2. You can crouch, but can't shoot when crouched.probaly not a bad game for when it came out, but nowadays, there are better games out there.Do yourself a favor and just go buy GTA San Andreas or GTA4. You won't be disappointed with those games."
2,Great Game...but Nothing To Do.,this game graphic wise is beautiful...and the city is huge and the weapons are alright. but once you realize ALL youll be doing is Killing people thruout the whole game...it gets kind of stupid. thats where this game fails. your a cop...you drive around killing people...and when its all done...you respawn everyone and do it again :| thats it..nothing else...nothing more...just shoot shoot shoot shoot shoot kill kill kill kill kill kill...i got tired of killing people after i killed the 100th person...definate rent...but wouldnt advise buying unless your going to go ONLINE with it..iLL .
3,Let's Be Fair...,"The only reason most people bought this game was for the Halo 3 beta. That is the simple bottom line in this game. The game itself is too easy and you can bypass too much of it. There is something to be said for ""open world"" games, but this takes it to the extremes. You literally do not have to do anything except kill the bosses. How lame is that? Games are being pushed out the door without any imput form true gamers. That has been a problem with the industry for years. This, unfortunately is no exception. Maybe a sequel can save this game from itself."
3,"Ultimately shallow, but what a blast!","Crackdown was honestly a breeze to finish. The main story is over in several hours and the life it holds after that is relegated to collecting orbs and finishing the odd achievement... But, while the main story is going, and you first start gaining abilities and growing in power, Crackdown is awesome. You really feel like you are a superhero jumping from rooftop to rooftop and throwing huge things across the city. For this reason alone, it's worth getting. If they can add new gangs and ability growth via xbox live, the game rating definitely goes up."
5,Crackdown lays the Smackdown.,Probably one the funnest games I have played since buying my 360! The replay value is huge and the challange of wanting to max out your character will have you putting this disc into your 360 again and again. The openness of the game is huge. Go where you want when you want. Don't want to take out the generals? Just want to go right for the Kingpin? Go for it! There's nothing stopping you. If you're afriad to spend another $60 on a game that doesn't deliver the goods then fear no more because this game delivers!
4,Just plain fun...,"Crackdown is a fun game that in my opinion feels a lot like a super-powered GTA, with missions to complete, vehicles to drive, and civilians to ""protect""."
4,Crackdown,"Overall, a very good game. Even though I got it because of the Halo 3 Beta (long expired), I very much enjoyed playing Crackdown; although it did take me a while to beat."
3,One time and One time only,"Crackdown in a phrase is a flash in a pan. The open world city is a great touch, the orbs are challenging, and the story is okay, but thats about it. You play as 'the agent' and you can go anywhere, do anything, and take out the three gangs in any order you choose. However once its done, its done. Sure you can continue to play but as for the story, you play it once, then you have to probably delete your file and start all over because there is no New game option. Normally I go into some detail about something I review, but this doesnt have any. Kill the bosses. There. Thats the game. All of it. You can get more out of GTA I assure you.Pros:+ Nice Graphics+ The city is HUGECons:- The story is a one time play through and the ending is just cliché and made me irritated.- Movement isn't the best in the world.I give this a 3/5, but make sure you have played all of the best games, the great games, and the good games in the world before going to mediocre."
3,"Fun, but repetitive.","At first, I was simply loving this game... I figured that after a bit I would get into the ""Meat"" and it would just get better and better... Not true... After six hours of gameplay I realized that there isn't much to do... It's still a blast to run around the city, but there just isn't enough actual gameplay... Missions? There are no missions so much as ""kill boss a, b, c, d, e, f, g, and win..."" That and street races, where the only thing you're racing is a clock, same with rooftop races. And that is IT. Oh, and a HUGE gripe I have... enemies have insane accuracy... Half the time I have no idea where they are, and the other half I see them, but it takes 10 seconds to lock in. Go figure. Still, I may gripe, but it is definitely a nice break game, and I only payed $5 for a used copy. Don't flush more than ten into it."
4,I like this game,"I'm such a girly girl lol I never would've thought that i would enjoy this game, i'm not a hardcore gamer or anything like that but this game can pass."
1,Cheesy game all around.,"This game is just all around cheesy from the story line to the game play, the objectives are not clear, and there are just mobs of enemies every where but you just don't really get any sense of satisfaction from completing missions they just don't feel like they have any deep meaning. I could not believe that they are actually making a second one after this one has bombed so much."
2,Very Weak Gameplay,"This would have been an OK game for the XBOX, but for the 360 it's very weak - the settings, graphics, etc. are all 90'sIf Halo is a 5, this is a 2. Save your money."
4,Right on time,"I have no complaints. Item was delivered just as expected, packaged safely, and undamaged. No complaints."
1,"Way overrated, does not live up to the hype","I was hearing how incredible this game was, how it's way better than saint's row or grand theft auto. So, I borrowed the game from my work and I decided to play it. Wow, is this game overblown. Only fun the first couple hours and then becomes terribly repeative. Once you max out your guy, what the hell is there to do? Plus, enemies constantly respawn, so most of the time you get shot off of a building and die. I'm at the end of the game right now, fighting the WANG guy and I screamed out in protest. I've beaten Gears of War on Insane diffuclty, but this game is just downright stupid. Plus, there is no storyline, you can get all of the achievements within about a day or two, and the graphics that everyone is raving about is not even on par with better games like Gears of Rainbow Six Vegas. Don't believe the hype, this game isn't all it's cracked up to be."
1,Worst game ever made?,"This has got to be the worst game I have ever played. I played the first Crackdown which was entertaining.Being able to jump over buildings was great fun. There were the obvious limitations: it's a bit too arcade-ish;there's no real progression; you can explore the Crackdown world but there's zero story.Crackdown 2 however is awful, just awful. The opponent AI is pretty miserable. Killing them becomes repetitive.Worst of all, the aiming system is so bad that it's difficult to aim at the right person. Often, I would be trying toaim at an opponent only to have the aiming system focus on a nearby car. There's no way to cycle through targets.This is just an awful game. Also, the orb collecting gets old after awhile and it takes too long to level up.I am glad I rented this game. This really is the worst game I have ever played."
4,Was worth it at $60,"This game was alot of fun when it was $60 and now it is $30. It is a free roaming, go any where, destruct-o match. It was one of the more fun I had completing a game. Unfortunately, online play is miserably slow and once you have leveled all the way up, the game quickly dulls.For $30, this game is a must buy for any XBox 360 owner."
4,really fun game,"I've read a few of the more negative reviews of this game and almost didnt purchase the game because of the few negative reviews, BUT from the moment I put it in this game has been really fun. A little annoying at times when trying to make jumps, aim, etc..but other than that the game is really exciting, a lot of action. To me the gameplay and plot of the game are pretty cool, and the idea of a super-human crime fighting agent is a fun one. Definitely would've been mad if I paid $60 for this, but at $30 it was def worth the money, I really enjoy the game."
5,Super Cop has a Super Adventure!,"This game is a very fun sandbox game that is lots of fun going through alone or with a friend via XBL. You don the roll of a genetically altered cop tasked with the clean up of the local mob bosses and their clan of goons and super goons. You have a couple basic stats that you level up but killing the hordes of baddies. You get penalized for killing innocent pedestrians and other cops. This game can be finished in about 20 hours, more if you go for the nerdpoints. It is fun enough for me at least to go through a few more times on the different difficulties and play with other people on XBL. I highly recommend this for anyone who wants a fun romp through a city running on roof tops and throwing cars."
4,Those peacekeepers need your help agent!,"This game was obviously created with having a good time in mind. To be so short (all the bosses take something like 12-15 hours to kill unless you try to max out your stats first) and utterly storyless, this game stands out as one of the most fun; most replayable game in recent memory. The cel-shading is mostly well done and only starts to look bad in really close-up camera angles that will probably screw the camera up anyway.The only real problems I have with this game is that sometimes a boss will inexplicably not be where his map marker says he is and although the criminals' banter is quite funny, they never shut up, even if there is no one around. Also the announcer continues to train you in the basics of playing the game no matter how long you've already been playing.Minor problems aside I totally recommend this game to anyone who like to play games that offer lots of mindless blowing stuff up."
4,Awsome fun but bad plot,"The game is tremendously fun to just roam around...and the explosions are the best, i sometimes just pile cars then get my firefly and shoot like 3 rockets and then watch it explode. The best part are the powers, the weapons, and the great heights...the downside is the story is pretty much non existent...they could have had a lot better story line but they chose not too"
5,Best sand box play...,"I have experienced in quite a while. Sweet engine with massive draw distance, no load times, tons of action and a reason to search every little corner. Unlike many games of this design I never got bored or felt what I was doing had no puprose (the skill building game this game some much needed depth). Throw in online co-op and you have a five star experience with the Halo 3 beta invite as a huge bonus."
3,Good for some cheap thrills.,"Not one of the greatest open world action games, but cheap enough to be picked up and enjoyed for what it is worth."
3,"Fun for a couple hours, then....","I found the game fun at first, but after playing it for a while, it got a little boring. The most fun I had was playing it in coop mode with my roomate. We stayed up past 3am blasting dudes and getting orbs. After a little while though we got bored and he wanted to play a different game. Next thing I know I'm laying sideways on the couch and his finger is inside me. I think the graphics could be better."
5,COOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL,"This is a really cool game. The only thing I don't like is that it is supposed to be in a ghetto futuristic city. I wish it wasn't a ghetto and was like a super cleaned up shiny city. Single player campaign is ok, it's kind of ridiculous when you have to take on hordes of gangsters and they're all shootin at u and that gets obnoxious, but the co - op is excellent. Gameplay I'd say 4 stars, Graphics I'd say 4.5 stars, story I'd probably give like a 4, but overall I'd give this game a 4.8. LOL"
5,"insanely fun, I love this game","totally worth the money. It's so entertaining, it's even fun just watching someone else play it. I maxed my guy out and killed all the bosses,..but it's still a riot jumping around the city. Can't wait for either the sequel or some downloadable extras. Great JOB to whoever wrote this game, it couldn't have been better!"
4,Very fun third-person shooter,"Robocop meets Superman. Crackdown is a lot of fun offering a wide variety of weapons, vehicles, and special abilities to use, master, and exploit. The scope of the game is impressive taking you across three islands and from sea level to several hundred feet in the air. Jumping from the top of the Agency will take your breath away.My nitpick with this game is the fact that the extra content available via Xbox Live Marketplace is expensive. Also, the re-playability is somewhat low."
4,Fun,"This game is pretty fun. Its hook is the ability to build your characters strentgh, agility, driving and firearm abilities. The cities are pretty life-like with people, cars and realistic highways. The downfall here is the game is too short and too easy. An advanced gamer can easily beat this game in 1 day if determined. The collecting of orbs and gaining achievements will probably give the replay value a week or two longer.. But after that its doubtful anyone will play it again. There is no multiplayer ""Versus"" support.. there is a co-op mode, but that becomes pointless after completing the game/achievements. The creators will do well to make the sequel longer and more multiplayer involving. Grand Theft Auto with a superhero touch."
4,Crackdown Review,"Good game overall. Never actually bought it because of the hype over Halo 3 at the time, but know I've gone back and played it and it's a good game. Worth the few bucks I paid for it."
4,"Not the Best Sandbox, But pretty close","Many sandbox and other free-roam games are just considered rip-offs of GTA, with a few exceptions like Mercenaries. This is one of those exceptions. You are given a city in the near future, run by 3 gangs. Your job is to wipe out the gangs by eliminating thier bosses and leaders, but who cares about that? The real fun is exploring and jumping on building-tops. This is one of those games where you can go anywhere you want, destroy anything you want, and DO anything you want. For fans of sandbox (free-roam) games, this will become an instant classic, and even if you aren't, you'll still get your money's worth!"
4,Huge Potential - Slightly Weak Implementation,"This game is tremendous fun. It's basically Grand Theft Auto where you are a genetically engineered ""supercop"" that must secure the city from the 3 major gangs. As your powers grow, the game gets more and more fun. There are only a few things that I do not like about this game, and they are all minor interface / control issues (cycle through targets,map interface, recover in mid-air from getting knocked off your feet). Co-op over xbox live is easily the best feature about this game. It could have been a bit more seamless, but it certainly works well. Excellent game that I would definitely recommend if you love these sandbox type games. I can't wait for Crackdown 2."
4,"A fantastic idea, that only comes out of the drawer on occasion","My kids actually love this. And my older son likes to do the most challenging choice on each card. I can't, however, give this a 5-star review, because it's one of those things you buy because it seems like a great idea ... then you put it away and forget about it. But, when the boys have brought it out (2 times since Christmas), we've had a good 15-20 minutes of healthy and physical fun."
5,Enough Space for Detailed Labels !,"This is a terrific product. It allows a person to create labels that are very comprehensive. We can make labels with two lines, for more detailed information. Why confine yourself to using the smaller labels, when this product is available? We used this product together with ""Hanging File Folder Plastic Index Tabs, 1/3 Tab, 3 1/2 inch Tabs"". THIS PRODUCT is both Laser and Ink Jet Compatible. It allows you to choose the Font Styles and Sizes that you like. The files look very neat and beautiful AND you can find the information when you need it. We highly recommend this product. Once the files are organized there is a great feeling of accomplishment. Happy organizing to all of you :-)!"
2,Not great with MS Word 2003,"Perhaps this issue has been fixed in more recent versions of Word, but I do not recommend these for use with Word 2003. Word 2003 does not appear to have an exact template for this Avery product and instead you have to use a general ""1/3 cut tab file folder"" template -- this causes the data to print just barely off and as a result about half of my lines were printed right on a perforation line, preventing me from being able to read the information. Not the time saver I had hoped for at all!"
3,What grown-up has time for all this drama?,"I read the book and picked up some good hints for dealing with unfairness and how to handle it if I should have to deal with a rogue coach or something. I guess we've been lucky. With the exception of the fallout of having to deal with one whacked first grade teacher, I have managed to bring kids to the teen/pre-teen years without getting too wrapped up in the drama of the kid who didn't get invited to the Big Party, or the Kid who Spends Too Much Time of the Sidelines or the Mean PTA Lady Who Makes Me Do Scut Work while all her cronies get the plum assignments. In short, I have a life, as do my kids, and they really aren't the same life. But in all our lives, not being invited to every event, or not being the kid with the most playing time on the court, or even being teased for wearing an eye patch are all small bumps in life's journey, not the measure of our self worth."
1,Twins plus One,"Would leave negative stars if I could. Seller says color may vary, but what they need to say is TOY may vary. I knew what the toy looked like as I was replacing one (and the one I have is EXACTLY what is pictured) and what arrived is NOT what is shown in the photo. DO NOT order from this seller, unless you are ok buying a surprise package! They do not ship the airplane toy they advertise! And the toy that arrived is TERRIBLE! It's a piece of junk. Not worth a 1/3 of what they are charging."
2,not enough,"this toy was purchased for my son, it was smaller than I thought and did not allow you to select to color. since it showed 3 different colors, wasn't sure if you got all three or did not allow you to select a color, guess you get what you pay for"
1,Not as advertised,"This plane was half the size as stated in the companys description. It also did not do the functions that were stated. I contacted the company about this product, they were prompt with their e-mails and wanted to correct the problem. All I wanted was an explanation as to why this product was advertised so blatently incorrect. No response. I live in Eastern Washington and this company is in Western Washington and they charged $11 to ship a $3 item 250 miles. Never again"
5,Run To Ruin,"This cd is more cohesive than The Blackened Air but still both disturbing and beautiful. I would call it a rock record with elements of slow core, backed by a gypsy orchestra. Jim White from the Dirty Three plays on it. His drumming is very intense and slow. The combination of instruments like dulcimer, piano, cello, accordion and electric guitar is fascinating."
3,I think it was upsetting but also strangely romantic.,This book is about a woman that gets kidnapped by an indian who is trying to save his tribe. This might have been the sweetest love story but lets face it Sandra Brown fans this guy was a total jerk.He kept me pissed off throughout the whole book. He was crude and mean and not the kind of guy I would call a hero or would likely fall in love with. I don't think anyone would. This one is kind of unrealistic and not what I would call my fantasy but in the end he turned out to be a good guy with a soft heart which kind of evened it out. Its not one of her best but its not one of her worst either.
1,"Should be titled ""The Pathetic""","This is probably the worst of Sandra's books.The kidnapper treats the kidnapped woman like garbage, calls her a slut, insults her motherhood and subjects her to even more mental cruelty and... she can't wait to ""make a passionate love to him"" in return. What a BS.Quarter way into the book, not only will you know the ending but you'll be disgusted. Save your money - this one isn't worth a buck."
3,Old-fashioned,"Was this Honor Bound all over again? Very predictable, old-fashioned plot (parts really bothered me). However, if that is what you are looking for, it is a good read. I finished it and didn't immediately regret the time I spent reading it."
1,Disappointing!!!,"I recently read a few books by sandra brown, the last being Fat Tuesday and the Witness. I liked her style, so I ordered a few more books which she wrote earlier one of which was this book. It seemed to me that she changed her style from ten cent romance novels to romance and mystery, and I was quite disappointed in this book.Too much repeating, too much unnecessary explaining of details and too much cursing. This book asked the reader to believe things that were not believable by any stretch of the imagination. If you enjoy short every-day romance this book is fine....but I prefer her later books which show her true talent."
3,"A typical ""held against her will by soon-to-be-lover"" tale","This is an average contribution to the fantasy world of women captured by a rugged, physically stunning speciman of manhood who is at first gruff and tortuous but who gradually becomes the woman's dream lover. I've read more suspenseful capture-fantasies, but this one is still a good read. I liked the incorporation of Native Americans in a contemporary setting, although Hawk O'Toole seems a bit flat as a character. The six-year old Scott was my favorite character because he is both realistic and entertaining."
5,Raw passion,"I usually don't read these kinds of books, I prefer historical but the American Indian theme drew me in. I am glad I gave it a try, a wonderful read. Unless you live on or near a present day Indian rez then you have no idea how things really are or how the majority of the people feel. Ms. Brown obviously did some research with respect to the Indian's point of view. I wish there were more books out there like these, then perhaps Americans would become aware of the racism and poverty the rez has to face. She also embraced their concern with family and friends, how they influence their children to remain family oriented. The romantic aspect was very passionate and sexy. Any woman would love to be in Miranda's shoes. Hawk's character was not your usual kiss the girl's butt kinda of guy but hard natured and masculine. Most women live their whole life and never meet a man like Hawk. He is almost too much man for many, I suppose that is why so many disliked his character."
3,quick and average read,"My buddy gave me this book because she knows what a great fan I am of Sandra Brown. I think Sandra Brown is one of the greatest romance writers, but no matter how great, a writer that puts out as many novels as SB can't get a super romance every time...and this book proves it. The book is small and a quick read, but I'm used to better Sandra Brown novels. I'm a collector of all her books but this one was just a loaner, so I'll give it back and if I run across it somewhere else, I'll buy it just to add to my SB library, but it's not one of her better novels. I didn't care much for Hawk O'Toole, probably because of the way he treated Miranda more than anything else. And I didn't care much for Miranda's name getting cut off to Randy. If a writer picks up a pretty name, why change it in the story? Go figure."
3,Morgan Fairchild is the worst reader I've heard yet!,"An interesting story, but the bad reading was very distracting. If fact, she brought the rating of the story down."
3,A Good Read for an Afternoon,"The story was very good and I enjoyed this book. A little unbelievable at times, but that's what an imagination is all about. The ending was how I imagined it wood be and on a whole it was a good read. Again, too much descriptive sex throughout this book. I enjoy a little here and there, but it was overdone."
1,Not for the reader who enjoys gentle romances.,"While I enjoy Sandra Brown's writing I could not enjoy this book. I find Hawk's treatmant of Miranda despicable.I could not find one single reason for her to fall in love with him. He kidnaps her son for his own gain, one minute he's threatening her, the next he's coming on to her & the next he's calling her a slut.He forces his kisses & ""gropes"" upon her, the scenarios remind me more of a date rape than a seduction. I wouldn't want a man to read this & think that is what women like. Perhaps if his stance on the Lone Puma Mine & Native American culture had been covered in more depth he might have had redeemed himself somewhat.. I also found the conclusion too abrupt & tied up a little too neatly."
1,Peltier Propaganda,"This tired story has shown to be rife with fabrications and made-up alibis. Peltier's true story can be found in the Federal Register, where court after court has affirmed his conviction. All of these major decisions preceded testimony in another trial (U.S. v. Arlo Looking Cloud, Feb, 2004) that revealed Peltier bragged about committing the murders in front of four witnesses."
4,Jean Shepherd fans should read this...,"...because Shep said you should. What other reason do you need? A slightly loving, slightly mocking take on the barbaric yawp."
1,the truth,"I'd say that if anyone really wants to know what these ""mormons"" are really about, read their book it has all you need to know about them. This video doesn't quite cut it."
4,Pretty good system..,"Pretty good all-around system for the average person. CD music sounds clear with little distortion at higher volume settings. I also was able to hook it up to my TV using the RCA jacks on the back and even that sounded really nice.The only draw back to this system is that you cannot manually set your EQ settings (which can be good or bad). It comes with pre-set settings depending on what type of music you are listening to. Really good for those who have no idea about these settings (like myself), bad for those who want more control or are picky about the sound.Overall I'd say this is a good buy."
5,Great straw totes!!,Have used a couple of these raffia totes for years....one in each vehicle so I always have them when I go shopping. Glad to find some new ones!! And at a good price and fast shipping.....thank you! Will buy some more for friends too.
3,"Good replacement, but not really an upgrade","I got this when the fans on my old system died. From what I can tell, they don't really make anything cooler (they are just tiny case fans after all). While the noise in idle is nice and low, they still ramp up like the old ones and can be heard from downstairs when I play for about 10 minutes.I would say grab these if you need to replace a faulty set, but don't grab them to upgrade. The performance on these fans are not really what they are advertised to be."
1,save your money,do not buy this product it really emits almost no lights and it gave my mxbox the red ring of death
3,Entertaining Format,"The story is all twisted around and filled with unlikely coincidences, but the format is highly entertaining and very original. It was like reading a book of sound bites - but it kept the story interesting. I didn't exactly love the characters with all their faults (and they have many) I had to keep reading to hold out the hope that they would get their lives together. Be prepared for this book to deal in a light (rather offensive) way with cancer, death, spirituality, mental illness, drugs, and more. It was an interesting book for more than just the story which is made to sound funny from the editorial review and the book jacket. It has it's funny moments but they are not representative of the book on whole."
4,'Tried by Fire',"This book is very interesting and touching coming from a first-time author. She writes from the heart and shares the ups and downs during her daughter's twenty-seven-month battle with a rare blood disorder that may have included Lupus as well. This book is a shining testimony of faith from the teenage daughter and also the mother that never left her bedside during their trying journey. You will be amazed, and you will laugh and cry as you read the pages....leaving you wondering what the ending will hold."
3,little disappointed,"It will hold up to 26 pre-programmed messages,,, however, what makes this item disappointing is that you can only play 1 (ONE) message at a time !!!.. you have to turn it off, re-insert your new message and turn it on again,,,,,,,,and with only 64 letters/symbols per line, it was not useful for my business needs,,,,,,,,otherwise it was cute as a novelty item.I will have to return it"
3,"Not Physics, but an interesting memoir","Certainly not physics or cosmology, a cross between memoir and philosophy. An interesting life, but Laughlin chose to not teach science in this volume. Just OK."
1,Where was the editor for this book?,"I think the author is a brilliant physicist with some incredible ideas, but he sure didn't express them in this book. As stated by others, there a various anecdotes (many which are funny and enlightening), but most without real relevance. I bought the book to learn about his ideas, but alas this book seems to be written for someone with a significant background in the subject matter already. My rating is really based on the readability (which is poor) since the book did such a poor job of relating his ideas I can't judge those."
2,Interesting Ideas Drowned by Platitudes,"The author presents several aspects of the so-called ""emergence"" - the self-organized occurence of ""new"" laws if as system exceeds a certain degree of complexity. Though the idea is not new, the approach is quite radical - the Newtonian physics is described as ""emerging"" from the quantum vacuum.Unfortunately, I have to substract nevertheless three points.First of all, the book contains too many platitudes and empty talk. Some chapters have absolutely no relevant substance and the stories presented are quite dull.Secondly, the spelling style is incomprehensible. This has nothing to do with the ideas presented. Instead of that, the book seems to consist of a conglomerate of run-on sentences written in a swollen-headed style.At last, the book is not very structured. It is not clear why there are chapters at all."
2,Not a very interesting book,"I bought this book with a lot of expectations, but was deeply deceived! It is a pompous book, confused, and not too well written. Just because one won a Nobel Prize doesn't oblige one to have the final true. Too many stories without too much interest in my opinion, too many quotations. I didn't had even the patiente to finish it. Best luck to all its readers..."
4,Emergence as a global phenomena,I read this book with fruition. The author develope his ideas in such a way that one can connect different fields of knowledge or the evolution of different systems (natural or artificial ones) by a unique phenomenon: emergence. I would say that the ideas are given only in a phenomenological way which is a first step in the understanding of a given phenomenon. I would expect one or two chapters with more explicit formal (litle more) relationship between aleatory different systems that were mentioned in the book.
1,The emergence of self-indulgence,"This was a disappointing book in several ways. Most significantly, the main concept - emergence instead of reductionism - was poorly explained. The anecdotes, ostensibly to illustrate scientific points for the sake of the unscientific reader, usually obscured what they were intended to clarify. Often they seemed little more than self-indulgent stories seeking a place to park themselves. The rapid accounts of various physical and biological items were of no use to a reader who already knew them, and were simply sleight-of-hand to one who didn't. The disresepect for the reader was truly insulting."
4,Emergence disguised,"I agree with most of your reviewers--Laughlin's book is not Nobelstuff. But give a point. It shows a laid back theorist who hasearned his prize already, and is easing into another perhaps moreimportant area of physics. In amongst his vignettes of personallife he is pointing ahead in the understanding of our cosmos.All ""beyond physics"" scientific progress emphasizes emergence.Take for instance the guidance of DNA in evolution. I would in-clude also the precise definition of the forces of nature. Any-body out there with ideas to help this concept along?"
5,Emergence,"One of the paradoxes of current science is the way it gets more and more brilliant about one aspect of reality, but leaves mostly everything out. Then that part is used to bludgeon everyone else into submission to a limited perspective that makes no sense of other fields. This limited vision is especially evident in biology as the enigma of life stands out as somehow an anomaly (?!), and yet it is the main event. The author's effort to give a lift to current suspicions/speculations about emergent phenomena hopefully is a bellwether for a turning point in science beyond the legacy of reductionism. He also takes a potshot at the current reign of Darwin's 'antitheory' that might be helpful in the current frenzy of the Darwin debate."
3,Less than meets the eye,"Emergence is an important concept, physically and philosophically, and Dr. Laughlin makes the case intrigingly, if not persuasively. His anecdotal style obscures rather than clarifies his arguments.The importance of this book may come when future physicists determine whether Laughlin's assessment of the future of physics is the work of a sage prophet, or that of an overcautious member of the scientific establishment. I can predict (having no reputation to risk) that when someone writes a collection of predictions that failed to come true, Laughlin's critique will rank with the 1900 assertion that the Patent Office had outlived its usefullness since everything had already been invented."
2,Passive-agressive work,"If you like physics, this is just an interesting book. It mostly discusses, at length, two ideas: emergence and reductionism. Doesn't sound like much, and it isn't, but at least it gives you a different point of view on the world. Unfortunately, from this point of view to the horizon is not that far. Mr. McLaughlin almost calls the present theories (like string theory) science fiction, easy on science (because of the scales and energies involved, he seems to think they are not provable; I don't have the knowledge to discuss if he is right or not), but he doesn't offer much of an alternative. He even comes close to saying that deeper levels of understanding are not possible, or not practical.Well, even if he is right, which I hope he isn't, between can't and science fiction, I prefer science fiction. Tomorrow I'll read a bit of string theory, and shake off the depressive mood left by this book."
2,Animals way too aggressive,This is not a very good hunting game the animals come and bite your *** off without any warning or provocation you can't get any hunting done for defending yourself. Even badgers attack you. If real hunting was like this thousands of hunters would bite the dust every year.
2,Attack of the Killer Animals,"It is a challenge to stay alive long enough to get some hunting in! The animals are bent on killing you from the instant you begin the hunt. At times I have been killed within the first 3 minutes...when that happens you wonder what is up. If you can stay alive long enough to get a good shot in, then you had better run back to cabin ASAP...because this is when they really go beserk. Consider that you can take down 3 or 4 attacking pack animals and then have the 4th or 5th one take YOU down... again, and again for the 30th time. It is like a war zone that bears not much resemblance to the hunting that I have been on. I much prefer more realistic simulation hunting. But if this is your type of thing, then you will love this game. Good luck...you will need it!!"
2,Cabela's Big Game Hunter 10,I really like the concept. Good challenges. The game locks up consistently right after the first career hunt. That is annouying.
1,Not classic Ludlum!,starts quite well but needs to be about 200 pages shorter. I got very bored whilst reading this book which is a first for me whilst reading a Ludlum book and it's much too predictable.
2,"Might have been interesting, till someone spoke","Nazis! Spies! Brainwashing!! I thought I was in for a great spy story, till one of the characters spoke. The dialogue was artificial and made the characters seem so fake. I like just about everything from simple everyday dialogue from the likes of Ed McBain to John LeCarre's pompous British spymasters with their droll metaphors and turns-of-phrase. But Ludlum's choice of dialogue made me shudder. (Let's italicize every third word! Let's have every second character exclaim, ""What?"") I put it down unread."
4,"Is it Fiction.......?....Not all, anyway.....","When you deal in general..with racism, ethnic purification, degradation of society by certain groups, you are very much in touch with what goes on in this world. The story is original and entertaining. The action never stops....you never know what will happen next. The characters in the novel are well suited for the role the author gave them in this adventure. I enjoyed it."
1,This book sucks!!,"This is the most boring and rediculous story I have yet to read. Don't bother wasting your money to buy this book. And if someone tries to give it to you, throw it back in there face"
3,Not Normal Ludlum!,I have read most of Robert Ludlum's books.This one was difficult to get excited about.The hero of this book is Drew Latham. His brother is doing undercover work on some Nazi organization.His brother dissapears and then reappears. Drew doesn't know if his brother can be trusted or not. Meanwhile this Nazi organization is trying to expand it's power. It is up to Latham to stop them. The book is hard to get interested in.Read Gemini Contendors it is much better.
1,ook,eu sou um abacaxi grande que aprecíe ler livros aburrido e eu aprecío comer o alimento de cambodia.
5,thumbs up,"Page-turner book, like a Craig Furnas thriller novel. Ludlum brings his intricately woven plots together with physical action to make your heart pitter-patter from page to page."
1,Life's too short for books like that.,"I've read most of Ludlum's former - really thrilling - novels. But this book was so dispappointing that I will never again touch one of his works. If an author concocts a story about Germans - good or bad - than he should try to give the impression that he has looked into the subject. Mr Ludlum is not even sure about the German language. His characters use words which are either antiquated, misspelled or simply imcomprehensible. Which makes it a funny book but not a good one. The story is naive and the book is absolutely ""putdownable"". I didn't do that because I've never before put a book down. Well, it was a hard time"
1,I can't believe I read the whole thing.,"Drew Latham as a member of the least intelligent intelligence service ever imagined, fights neo-nazis and their plan to create the Fourth Reich. No one sleeps as Drew is marked for death by the neo's death squads (he actually counts how often he's been attacked in the last 24//36/48 hours).Ludlum, whose works I have previously known as adapted for film and tv, shows that it is possible to get anything printed.I kept reading hoping there would be a hook, something that would bring me in, incredibly he's mananged to lower my expectations at each step...and then failed to meet them.True I've not finished, there are still thirty pages to go, but if he pulls it out in those...I'll resubmit this review."
1,Unreadable!,"American spy Harry Latham reappears after an undercover investigation of a powerful neo-Nazi organization bearing information that could expose Nazi sympathizers - or lead to the *collapse* of democratic states and institutions worldwide! It is up to his brother Drew, and the mysterious Karin de Vries, to save the day! Full of devices and plot twists worthy of a James Bond movie, the story is told almost entirely in breathless dialogue replete with *italics* and exclamation points! If you think it's annoying in a 93-word *review*, try reading a whole 768-page *book* like this!"
1,Not one of Ludlum's best,"In the past, I have enjoyed Ludlum's novels. So it was with great anticipation that I opened the pages of this one. What a diappointment! After 150 pages I was still waiting for the book to improve, but alas, it was not to be. The main character/ ""hero"" Drew Latham is so wretched conceived that if stupidity were an Olympic event, he would rate a perfect score of 10 from every judge. He simply isn't believable and neither were any of the other characters. Pass this one by, and reread The Holcroft Covenant or The Matarese Circle."
1,Mr. Ludlum's work continues to decline in quality,"I used to buy and read every Ludlum book, but Apocalyspse Watch has to be the bottom of the barrel. His attention to detail and plots have deteriorated to the point I think someone is ghost writing after Mr. Ludlum develops the plot. An example is the scene in the Rhine River - no thought whatever to the constant barge traffic which would have interfered with most of what is happening. I've bought my last Ludlum book."
2,Ludlum Shmudlum...when do we get a new plot?,"OK so I am against the popular vote, but give me a grabber with a new plot that doesnt twist predictably and I'll 5 star it. Go read for a quick sleeping pill. BH"
1,Inept Twaddle,"I had never read Ludlum before so I picked this one to sample him. If this is representative of his writing, I am totally at a loss as to why he was so popular. The writing in this book appeared to be unedited and much of the language was unintentionally funny. The character development was haphazard and uninteresting. All the characters were cliched and the action sequences contained no effective build-up and were extremely unexciting. I resolved to finish the book although it was an excruciating 700 plus pages. All I can say is this book made Tom Clancy's writing seem like Shakespeare. Thank God for LeCarre."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"This Ludlum novel is of the died in the wool spook variety from the outset. Two brothers are secret agents, and one has been undercover, working against a group of neo-nazis. When he loses contact his Consular Operations brother wants to know why.He is pretty shocked when he finds him, it seems his head has been messed with, and he is carrying some incediary information.Cue chase scenes, twists and turns in Ludlum style."
3,"Great Book, a bit long though","This is the first Ludlum book I have read. Quite an interesting read, actually. The book was a bit long, as thick as a Harry Potter book (I read the hardcover edition). The mystery and the action was enough to keep me reading the book till the wee hours of the morning, probably because I thrive on spy and mystery thrillers and watch shows like Alias and CSI :) The plot twists were great, especially the first few chapters of the book, and Harry Latham's character was believable. The ending was a bit predictable though, probably due to the fact that you start to get to think like Latham and DeVries."
3,OK ...but no cigar,"I bought this book because of the high ratings. However, compared to other books available, this one is just OK, three stars at best. There are lots of large photos, some of which convey little information and seem to serve only as filler for what would otherwise be a very thin book.The book is well written from the point of view of an ""observer"" but lacks the depth and insight which would be expected had it been written by an experienced upholsterer.A much more comprehensive treatment of the subject can be found in Custom Auto Interiors by Don Taylor and Ron Mangus."
1,Completely inadequate for a serious custom interior,"I found this book simplistic and of little truly useful information. Yes simple is great for a total beginner but this far from enough to actually carry out a complete interior from nothing. The examples (which were few) were not even really custom, but just plain jane chevy. And just where was the restoring part of this book?I have found this type of book is just basically a teaser for the larger more pricier books. So save your money and purchase something with more substance behind it."
4,"Pro Pain Never changes, but who cares","Honestly, seeing the artwork on this album kind of made me a little unhopeful by this album, but all I can say is that PRO PAIN F*cking destroys anything on the radio to this very day. yes the are semi Generic, but so is all the garbage that filters around on the radio mtv, vh1, Pro Pain I think is WAY under rated. Buy this F*cking album."
3,"Brand new PRO-PAIN ""Round 6""","There are not many things that come out of New York City that I like for example the New York Yankees, But PRO-PAIN is one thing I love about New York City! The boys are back with a new album ""Round Six"" and a new label-- Rawhead/Spitfire. Round 6 includes a few more guitar solos then previous albums which is a nice mix between the heavy crunch/grind rhythms. Round 6 has the sound that Pro-Pain fans have come to love- Heavy rhythms, pounding drums, & Gary's menacing voice. Most songs are short around 3 mins or less so the CD doesn't last too long. ""Substance"" is one of my faves cause it has additional vocals from either Tom or Eric(not sure who)that break in between Gary's vocals. Like what the did with Ice-T on ""Put the Lights Out"". It's the kind of CD that doesn't win the Grammy's but who really gives a crap about the bands who do? I give Pro-Pain 3 stars for their latest release, it's a great CD but nothing really you haven't heard before. ***"
5,Great choice for young independent readers!,"I have a five-year-old who is a voracious reader. It's hard to find chapter books that have content appropriate to her age but are still substantial enough to draw her in...and that she can't polish off in one sitting! Lady Lollipop has a wonderfully playful, fairy-tale feeling that fits the bill perfectly. I loved hearing my daughter burst into laughter as she read the book."
4,Fun to read with my Girls,"In a world where everybody seems to be like prince and princesses, this story was great to read with my 7 and 9 year old daughters before bedtime. I thought it might be boring for my 9 year old, but she loves animals and loved the story. Lady Lollipop is a wonderful story of how a spoiled princess learns how to be patient and thoughtful as she befriends her new pet pig and the trainer that accompanies her. Cute. My 7 year old is now a Dick King-Smith fan!"
5,Truly Found Paradise,"The David Lanz CD ""Finding Paradise"" is a very good album. To begin with, I feel that all of the tracks on the CD are well written. Moreover, the recording mix for the entire CD was good. I like the fact that not one instrument was over powering. Usually, the artists' main instrument is overpowering the rhythm and harmony. In the case of ""Finding Paradise,"" this problem does not exist.My favorite song on the album would have to be track 8, Sound of Wings. The chord progression throughout the chorus is very soothing and relaxing. In addition, what I like most about this song is changing dynamics throughout the song. The song starts off with MP (mezzo piano) dynamic. Then gradually builds to a forte dynamic.""Finding Paradise"" is an excellent album. I feel that people who like easy listening jazz along with solo piano would be attracted to this album. ""Finding Paradise"" strays away from realist jazz, however the compositions are attractive and relaxing."
2,Finding Paradise by David Lanz,The item was used and had some scratches on it. After several playings it started to skip. I would not buy a uesd CD again.
5,Paradise Found!,"David Lanz has always raised the bar when he releases a new album and this one is no differnent. Though it is much different from Christofari's Dream the spirit is definitly there. If you loved Lanz's older stuff then you will like this new edge he has on as well. Lost In Paradise the alternate title to this CD, is a great song, probably my favorite."
2,Repeat of One Minute Millionaire?,"Hearing David speak made me buy this book. The book reads like an autobiography and takes the reader on the journey how he found 100,000 to repay his debts instead of running away from them leaving his creditors unpaid (His first thought). I gave 2 stars as when finished reading it, it reminded me of being a duplicate of One Minute Millionaire by Mark Hansen where the 'fictional' character of that story uses wealth principles to find $1,000,000.00 in 90days whereas David takes just under a year to achieve his goal using similar vehicles to obtain results. Even so, well done David in not running from creditors and motivating readers to do the same."
4,Satisfied with product but not with Amazon,The webcam is good. Quality is ok. It was mentioned in the description that it would come in a NEW WHITEBOX OF LOGITECH. I received the product in a brown box which was not any Logitech box. I was not sure whether it was new or not. I wrote back to Amazon. They sent me the product again and it was same as before i.e. In a brown box with a selotape but not a Logitech box. I wrote back to Amazon with no result. I needed the webcam and had to keep it not sure if it is new or refurbished.
3,OEM version is missing features,"If you do a search, you'll notice there are a few listings for the Logitech QuickCam Communicate STX. This one here is the OEM version. That's probably why this is a few bucks cheaper than the other listings.It comes in a plain brown box with just the software disc, the webcam, a desktop base, and a monitor clip. There's no instruction booklet. And the webcam is missing some features. There's no privacy shade and there's no snapshot button on the side for taking stills.So if you're just looking for a basic webcam without all the extra features, buy this OEM one and you'll save a few bucks. But if you want all the features, or you're giving this as a gift and you want the nice retail box, do a search for Logitech QuickCam Communicate STX and buy the regular version."
4,Mediocre,"Well the the picture quality is okay, can be easily used for messenger chatting. However, am facing a problem- evrytime I use it while chating it the PC hangs and I have to restart the messenger"
3,Very good webcam (little expensive though).,"Very good webcam, gives much better quality than other chip ones. But it's little expensive to buy if your laptop already has one in-built."
4,Happy with it,"As some other reviewers have noted, the camera and accessories are just packed in a box, so it wouldn't be the greatest presentation for a gift. It's also true that there is no privacy shade, but I've never understood the point of those anyway...it's supposed to take video, right? Anyway, you could cover it up yourself if needed.The only problem I've had with it is picking up sound. I think there's supposed to be a built-in mike, but I've just been using a separate one until I find time to figure out what's wrong. Overall, I'm happy. It works well with Skype, which is all I wanted."
5,A to Z for those who need help,All the letters are there. There is reinforced paper where the holes are to prevent tearing.... came on time. cheap.good deal
4,What I think.,I like that the book is easy to read and understand. I recommend this book to anyone who is studying color therapy.
5,Great for organizing,"Love these type of dividers! You don't have to write on those little tabs, slip them in, then replace them when they fall out randomly. Also, these are great if there are any changes in the tabs, just adjust the front page. With the tabs that have the labeled inserts, one would have to adjust every tab that moves, which can be tedious and time consuming!"
2,Not as useful as I had hoped.,"I purchased this product because the description said I could label these dividers with my computer, using the Avery Templates at Avery.com. The only problem with that is, the Avery dividers I bought don't seem to exist on the Avery.com website. If you are looking for help with printing on these, this is not your product."
1,"Deceptive and Twisted, devised by powerless men","This is a production by wanna-be scholars whom know nothing more than their personal ambitions. they seek not for light and truth, but for power and gain. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS!, Buy a REAL Book of Mormon and a real Bible, and FIND OUT FOR YOURSELF what is true; by asking GOD!, Not these self-serving men."
3,Readable,"There are good things about this book, with the setting in China being the main one. I enjoyed the picture See paints of daily life in China and of political and police activity there--though whether it is an accurate portrayal is unknown. She provides some Chinese history, particularly relating to the Chinese Cultural Revolution under Mao, which is pretty fascinating and depressing stuff. She also provides a true surprise ending to her story--for me, if not other readers.The problems are rampant, however. See's book comes off as amateurish, with wooden main characters, an expository tone in her writing, and too much plot activity, which leads to too much telling and not enough showing by the author.I read this entire book, but only because I didn't have another book to read at the time. I will not pursue this short series."
2,Very difficult for me to get into,"I'm a big fan of Lisa See's other work; Snow Flower and The Secret Fan, Peony in Love and Shanghai Girls all delighted me and kept me intrigued. This book, on the other hand. I didn't enjoy. Aside from my unlikeable character gripe that I have with See's characters, this just didn't do it for me. It was slow, it was boring, and somehow the end of the mystery was both predictable and too far out there. Since I'm always looking for things to read, I might still pick up the next Red Princess mystery, but this book has gone a long way in destroying my love for Lisa See books."
3,Interesting but lacks polish,"I am a huge Lisa See fan, and have enjoyed all of her other books. As usual, this one contains many interesting descriptions of Chinese life and history, and the plot itself is also intriguing. However, there are many jarring word choices, and a few false notes that suggest that she does not value this type of book as much as her others. If Ms. See and her editors would spend as much time working out the awkward transitions in this book as they do on her others we would have a series worthy of her abilities."
4,Fascinating View Of Chinese Culture,"This is a difficult book to review. If I could rate the portions set in China, I'd hastily give the novel a five star rating. On the other hand, I'd have to give three stars to the sections set in America. See's descriptive flare, which I've enjoyed immensely in her other fiction works, sparkles when the characters are in China - as do her Chinese characters. I especially liked the doctor of herbal medicine. Some of the U.S. law enforcement agents are a bit flat and the relationship between Hulan and David doesn't always feel genuine. Still, the details about the Cultural Revolution are marvelous as well as educational and the crime in this novel is certainly unique. It's worth the read and I have faith that this duo will continue to develop as the series progresses."
2,"Lightweight, but might make a good movie","This is basically a police procedural which spans the globe between China and the U.S. There's a female Chinese investigator and an American district attorney and predictable international intrigue and romance. The book is lightweight and simple and would make a good movie that would have a familiar ring. I've seen this story before, over and over again. But yet had few relaxing hours with it."
1,Where did that come from???,"I found the plot twists to be pretty darned forced. The characters would react to sudden revelations as if they were extraordinary conclusions to previous circumstances. The only problem was that the previous circumstances were non-existant, and only ""explained"" at the same time to support the new bend in the story. Hardly exciting. I found myself, as the heroes were in danger, saying to myself, ""good, kill them off...it might make this book a little more interesting."" I do give credit to the research on Chinese herbal medicine and Beijing...interesting learning assuming it was accurate."
2,Disappointing,"Having enjoyed ""On Gold Mountain"", Lisa Sees story of her family's history in California, I was disappointed in this novel. Perhaps the author should stick to nonfiction. I found the writing stilted, particularly the dialogue. The plot was contrived, with coincidences that rendered the story completely unbelievable. I did enjoy the descriptions of life in China, but beyond that would not recommend it."
3,Love Story Weak,"We are reading this book, Flower Net as our next read for our Book Club. I was interested in reading about China and thought a Chinese Mystery would be helpful, it was, but the love story was weak and I didn't find the main characters at all interesting. I probably will not read any more in this series."
2,Paperback Books,This was advertised as new..but the cover was bent up pretty badly..didn't effect the readability but still..I like to get what I pay for
4,Interesting commentary on China within classic detective story,"Hulan is a Chinese inspector and a Red Princess, born to a favored family. This history follows her as she investigates a high-profile murder. When the son of the American ambassador shows up dead, Hulan is tasked with finding the killer. When a related murder shows up in L.A., Hulan is paired with her former lover, David, to solve the international crime. Along the way they rediscover each other and the secrets they kept hidden as they deal with Chinese gangs, rich businessmen, corrupt government officials and the illegal trade of endangered animal parts.Lisa ArdAuthor of 'Fright Flight, Dream Seekers Book One'"
4,Mystery Plus Content,"Lisa See never disappoints. She has successfully entered the mystery genre, and I look forward to reading more Red Princess books. Not only is the plot engaging, the story line contains many interesting facts about Beijing and life in China. The two main characters are well-defined and are very real. It has just enough suspense without becoming a total action thriller. The language is well-crafted. I hope Lisa See continues with this series."
1,Glad I received it after the Cowboys v. Minnesota game,Talk about timing. If I had gotten it sooner I would have antagonized others with it. But since they made sucha dismal appearance at the game. I have yet to open the box. It should come in handy next year.
5,A.J. is the best!,A.J. is the most sweetest guy I ever read about. I hope that everything he said about his fans are true but I was totally heart broken when I found out that he has a girlfriend named Amanda but as long as he's happy so am I.
2,I'd keep looking...,"Nice looking, but not well engineered. Bolts did not fit well and the item is not as sturdy as it could be."
3,Could have been better ....,... if it wasn't missing the back slat for the bench part ... still trying to get that part ... may have to return the whole thing ... shipping will be expensive as it is heavy.
4,A very important tool,"As an architect, this book it's been so helpful to me to visualize my ideas, and allow me to express what I see, feel and want to show to other using drawings."
4,"quick, simple graphics","I really like this book because it's not that ""technical"" and it's filled with practical advice for producing graphics! One of the only complaints that I have is that the materials suggested are a bit out-of-date (e.g. marker colors) but that is really it. I'd suggest this book for anyone looking to make fantastic graphics in a short amount of time."
2,Not recomended,"The quality of the renderings in this book are horrible, if I had things like this in my portfolio or submited work like this, I would get nowhere very fast. Some look as if he put markers through a paper shredder and let them just drip randomly on the paper, then smeared it around a bit. All of the Case Studies are of things he (the author) has done, so there is absolutly no diversity in this book. Try some of the more expensive alternatives, you get what you pay for I assume."
4,Awesome in Concert,"Matt is not only a brillant performer, his album rocks as well! Lucky Boy(a song about his brother) is a rocking song and Matt's unique lyrics and beats keep him above other acoustic performers."
3,"Great Artist, Mediocre Album","Love Matt Nathanson, I think he is great in concert. I have no doubt that he will continue to gain popularity on the music scene. However, this album is poorly produced with cheesy background vocals. Do yourself a favor, save the 20 bucks, buy a ticket to his concert, or better yet wait for his new album to come out."
1,MATTS AWESOME!,"Hey, I dont have any of Matts CDs, YET! But Christmas is right around the corner HaHa! But I've seen him live and it was so worth the money! I had never heard of him before, and now im like a MAtt Junky! lol!"
4,Matt is fabulous in any form.,"Though I must say I prefer Matt live hands down, his studio cds are good warm ups for the shows. This particular one is lots of fun, with great lyrics and catchy tunes. They're all heartfelt, personal, and touching - and when you see him perform live, you'll instantly be converted into a massive fan. He's hilarious on stage, and also extremely passionate - making an unforgettable experience.He's also not a ""kid"" - he's been around for years, making numerous amazing records on independent labels. You really believe him when he sings, he's got conviction and credibility. He's mature, experienced, and amazing. Check him out!"
4,Good stuff,I have practiced a few of Susan's ideas including a) being a big person b) change yourself to spiral changes in my spouse c) 'act as if' and they have worked so far. I acknowledge I have not read further but it works.--Rahul
5,Loaded with practical advise,"This practical book is filled with useful tips on shaping up a damaged relationship. The book is written in a friendly, compassionate, non-clinical style which makes it accessible for just about everyone. If you are experiencing difficulty with a partner or spouse and are not sure how to handle the situation, try this book. I found reading it gave me a wake-up call and new perspective on the problems I was experiencing with my partner."
5,One of the best books on relationships,"This book is one of the best on relationships I have ever read. Its title suggests that it is for married couples, but the information in invaluable for any relationship. She shows you how to make any relationship just the way you want it!It is not necessarily a book for fixing bad relationships (although it will help). It can make your ordinary relationships extraordinary ones.You can read the book like a novel and it will affect your life. Stop to do the exercises and it could transform your life."
5,AMAZING!,"I didn't believe at all that this would work but it really really did!The whole idea of ""good will"" seemed rediculous to me, until I tried it and discovered it really works!There are plenty of exercises to try, things to experiement, and so much advice!A MUST READ FOR EVERY RELATIONSHIP!!!It's not about fixing a broken marriage, this works for anyone who is in a relationship and wants to keep it successful!"
4,Good Tips!,This book has some really good tips and really helps you focus on what negative energy you bring into the table and how focusing on the negative will not bring you what you want or help your relationship improve. Over half way through it and have received some good info.
1,Doesn't deserve one star,"If you are buying this book in hopes of saving a failing marriage, you might be disappointed. Only couples actively working together to improve their relationship might benefit from some of this advise. If your relationship has disintegrated to the level where just one of you is trying, you're not in a relationship at all. Following Susan Page's strategies under these circumstances might do you more harm than good. There is no such thing as a relationship that works on half power and this is exactly what is suggested between these pages. This could be catastrophic for partners in a verbally or emotionally abusive marriage where they are blamed constantly for everything already.The title of this book is deceiving and maybe even a little irresponsible."
4,Rabbit Wine Opener for Countertops,"This wine opener works like a dream. It includes a nice foil cutter to make the job clean and easy. For very short bottles, a paperback book has to be placed under the bottle to put it in the correct position."
4,Nice addition to our collection,I have been looking for a countertop wine opener for some time. When I saw this I knew I had to have it. I fits nicely on our bar and works just as described in the write up. I have used it several times during the holiday. I'm glad I purchased it.
5,Beautiful and functional,"I was very pleasantly surprised at the quality and look of this opener. The suction doesn't work well on the small tiles on our countertop, but it's heavy enough that it doesn't matter that much. Love it."
3,Reasonable wine opener,"I bought this countertop wine opener after a similar one we had bought from Costco a few years ago broke. This is was quite a bit more expensive than the Costco one. The wine opener looks stylish, but the suction cup at the bottom doesn't work as well as I expected. It works well on some surfaces, but not on all the surfaces my Costco opener was able to attach to."
2,Well Done but Boring,Stevenson's analysis felt too dry for my taste. Although well researched it never grabbed me. I felt I was reading a College text book.
4,Excellent WWI Overview,"As others have stated, appreciation of this excellent book requires reasonalbe prior knowledge of the primary battles of the war. This is not a military history, but strives to explain how & why the war started, how the military strategies & outcomes of the combatants were shaped by political, economic & technological developments, and how & why the war ended. The specific military progress of the war is not described with the details of separate battles, but (instructively) by a bigger-picture approach to season-long, regional campaigns. This military overview is then correlated with contemporaneous political trends, providing a very cohesive picture of multiple aspects of the war. There are several moments when the writing gets bogged down in lists of numbers, but this dense text is in general very well written and easily readable. The maps are even pretty good, atypical for a WWI history.A new reader in the field should start with Keegan, then read this."
3,"for beginners good, for ww1 buffs bad","the book first of all is laden with editorial gaffs. the maps are the same we've been seeing over the years elsewhere without showing anything new. real politics is given short shirf. episodes requiring a chapter are summarized in a paragraph.as a starter book it does well or to those just wanting the most succinct synopsis of ww1 all over again. i was very dissappointed. hew strachen's, to arms is the most definitive we have on this subject."
3,Hurried but heart-felt.,"Here is a novel by an accomplished author who obviously had insufficient time to create a work of more depth. Its plot and characters are embryonic; however, it is easy to see how they might have become much more memorable. Homeric themes give the story a charming archaic tone which is wholly absent from most modern novels, and the emphasis placed on community and family is very refreshing. By the book's conclusion, the reader discovers that the authors' intent was not to provide a sensational account of apocalypse; but to show that, whatever its outcome, no catastrophe can ever subsume our highest call to family and covenant community."
2,"Boring, no real ending to it","The story started out okay but lost steam and direction about 1/3 of the way in. Even the title was inaccurate because in the story, everything did not all shut down in one day. Wordy, too much Tennesee history and other stuff that was totally irrelevant to the overall story. Some characters were interesting but they didn't do much. There was no closure to the story. What happens to everyone now? I liked ""Y2K : It's Already Too Late"" by Jason Kelly much better. The characters and story line were believeable and you felt like although bad things happened, the story ended with closure and an upbeat ending. If Michael Hyatt wrote this book ""Day the world shut down"" to scare people, it was wholly inadequate. If was meant to lead Christians back to their faith, it was also inadequate. I would have liked to see Noah get saved at the end."
1,THE WORST,"The worst book I've ever read. The writing is poor. The plot is sophomoric. The book is pedantic, small-minded dribble, pseudo-profundo babble, a tour de force of mindless musings and Christian-right blather. I found particularly absurd the diatribe in which Stalin, Hitler, and Mussolini are, combined, less evil than Margaret Sanger.This book is so bad that it is funny, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a tearful and side-splitting laugh."
3,204 pages before reaching the important the day,"I was disappointed in this book for I had hoped that it would offer better insight into what we can expect on/after 01/01/2000. I was expecting that the authors would use the fictional format (to avoid worry about lawsuits if projections do not come true) to counsel the average person in how to better prepare now/live after. Instead, I found the book heavy in philosophy/light in practicality. I found the characters only minimally developed and not one of them made a physical or emotional impact on my mind. The authors took 204 pages to ever arrive at ""the day the world shut down"" then gave us only a fleeting, hurried glance into the future in the remaining 63 pages. I found the work lacking depth in plot and development. I was especially disappointed since I very much admire Michael Hyatt and credit his book, ""The Millennium Bug"" with opening my eyes to the problems we face and the preparations needed."
2,"Immature, pseudo-moralizing","The authors have used Y2K to stuff their pseudo-moralizing Christian religious views down the readers' throats. All philosophies other than Christian are discarded as ""hoaxes"" and ""junk"". A very conceited, typically Christian view indeed."
2,S.U.Carbs,"The content is excellent, however, the reproduction print is very small, and the paperback binding is not suitable for garage or workshop use."
5,For The Last Time George Strait Live From The Astrodome,George Strait is one amazing singer. He has recorded many different albums and each and every one is excellent. His latest cd Live From The Astrodome.... Is an amazing cd. It has a little bit of the old Cds and one or two of his latest songs. I enjoy hearing day after day and it is a cd that nobody will get tired of. The price is nothing compared to the quality. You will pay fifteen dollars and your will not regret using your money to purchase this Cd. I suggest you run out and get it this moment. Like I said before u will not regret buying it.
4,COMM/215 Collaborative Review-,"This review is an in-class collaborative-writing exercise of a University of Phoenix COMM/215 class.Those of us who like country music think that ""Write This Down"" is a well-written song with a positive message.Those who are not so fond of country music suggest that Mr. Strait improve his vocabulary by finishing grade school."
2,"The art work is striking, but...","Although visually striking, this book falls short of meeting the criteria of a good ABC learning book. The pictures used to represent the letter sounds were not always the first word that comes to a child's mind. For example: an artist's palette with pools of paint leads a child to say ""paint"" instead of ""colors"" as the artist intended. Dishes of ice cream are ""S for sundae"", a man playing a trumpet is ""M for music"" and these are only 2 more examples. ""ABC Pop!"" is wonderful for its illustrations but there are much better books to teach the ABC's."
2,Lead warning,"The product description does not tell you that the brass in the product contains lead. When I received it, the packaging gives a warning that you should wash your hands after handling the product. If I had know this, I would not have ordered it. I have a home with kids and this is not a safe product to have around."
4,"Excellent full action, not really ""lifetime""","I have used these hose end sprayers for many years, including the identical (but all black) Craftsman model. They have the best ""full action"" nozzle of any multi-pattern sprayer I have tried, in addition to decent shower and flood settings. I must admit that the ""lifetime"" warranty is really unrealistic and this unit needs o-ring replacement/rebuilding every couple years (one can also just canabalize the parts that wear from the all plastic, most inexpensive model). I have tried a number of other brands and always come back to this one."
1,False advertising!,"This was purchased mainly because the description said, ""Made in USA"".The packaging on the item received says, ""MADE IN CHINA""!!!"
1,Deceptive Advertising - Product is not made in USA,"I ordered this particular product because the manufacturer claimed this product is ""made in the USA."" However, upon receiving the product the packaging indicates ""made in China"".Needless to say I will not order any products from this manufacturer in the future or from the vendor that sold it to me."
1,TERRIBLE. worst misrepresentation I've ever seen. shame on Amazon for selling such a blatantly deceptive product,"product says 'cocoa butter solid'. what a joke- the first 3 ingredients are mineral oil, petrolalum, and parrafin. in fact according to the label, it has more fragrance in it than cocoa butter. It even contains corn oil !! I could have saved myself some money and time by buying a cheap candle and rubbing it on. Label shows a picture of a cocoa bean - it should have shown an oil rig and ear of corn !!! no wonder they don't show the ingredients in the ad - not even on the manufacturer's website.shame on Amazon for even allowing it to be catagorized with real cocoa butter products."
3,"Not the 5th's best, but not bad","Billy Davis Jr is without question the most over-looked, GREAT male soul singer of the sixties/seventies. Just listen to his take on ""Feelin' Alright"" and ""A Change is Gonna Come."" As great as soul belters Dennis Edwards, David Ruffin and others were, Billy Davis could sing all of them under the table.The vocal in general are top-notch here especially in today's bland vocal arena. These five would make any of today's groups run for cover!"
4,great for sensitive noses,these are soft and strong... great if you need to use them frequently.lose a point because I find Puffs a little thicker.
5,HOw to get a product that you really need at a wonderful price,"Where I live, (rural Vermont) it is practically impossible to find this product, especially with the lotion in it. Also, at such a low price. I look forward to seeing it on your list of products to buy. The promptness of delivery is also very important in my location."
5,Great!,"Can't beat the softness when lotion is built into the tissues... I just wish they were in the smaller box shapes rather than the big rectangular shapes. This large pack will last you quite a long time, even through the cold season!"
1,Not as good as Puffs w/ Lotion.,"During a recent cold, I bought a box of these Kleenex w/ Lotion tissues because they were cheaper than the Puffs w/ Lotion tissues. I was sorely disappointed. The Kleenex brand tissues are as coarse as gas station toilet paper.I ended up trudging out into the snow again to find Puffs brand, which is like a pillowy cloud compared to these. A side by side comparison should be enough to convince anyone."
3,Kleenex Purchased on Repeat Order Through A. Prime,Good Kleenex product at a good price. The Amazon purchase plan works well for Kleenex and toilet paper.
2,bad reaction to Kleenex with lotion,"I've been a fan of kleenex with lotion for a few years now--I have persistent, mild allergies, and use lots of tissues. These were much easier on my skin than non-lotion types. About five months ago, I developed an unpleasant blistering rash on my upper lip and around the edges of my nostrils. After cutting out every commercial skin product I use, cosmetics, even sun-screen, to no effect, I tried going off the lotion tissues (yes, I know, it should have been obvious given the location of the rash...), and within a week the rash cleared up. I gave them a second chance, and the rash came right back. I have sensitive skin, and for lots of people these will be a great product, but there are a lot of chemicals in these tissues, and for me they caused a pretty nasty little problem. So, if you get a funny rash in the middle of your face, try laying off the super-tissues."
4,"Great, strong tissue!","We really love these and use them all the time. The only thing you have to be careful about is that the lotion makes them impossible to use to clean your glasses. Other than that, they're incredible for us ""allergy girls and boys,"" they hold up to repeated blows, and they're quite large so you definitely get your money's worth. They're well worth the extra few cents you pay for them (just save the boxtop and give it to your local school to make up for the difference!). Highly, highly recommend!"
5,tissues,Tissues are so bulky its nice to have them mailed to you. The only weird thing is that some tissues are dry and some are not. Don't know why.
1,NO lotion,This is terrible. The commercial is not very accurate when it says it has real life lotion in it. And the box is not as pretty either.
4,Good buy for the money,"I bought this model because it was the ""stripped down"" model. I have used it almost daily (pretty good huh?) since I got it. I like the way it feels and works. The only down side is the black rollers wear away little by little. I get some black ""shavings"" on the carpet. I am happy with it- I would buy it again."
2,What's the Weight?,Interesting product but Avery simply refuses to tell you the Paperweight of the product and nice heavyweight paper can easily be too heavy for your printer.
2,I wish the carstock was thicker,"I have not found DIY business cards that are thicker than these by Avery. So I guess Avery's product is decent. The edges do tear nice and smoothly. However, keep in mind that these cards are not quite as thick as professional business cards. A stack of 20 Avery cards will measure about 4.5mm (9 pt. thickness per card or 65 lb. weight) vs. a stack of 20 professional cards will measure 7.5mm (15 pt. thickness per card or about 115 lb. weight)"
2,A bit flimsy (cheap) feeling,"Hi, these cards are great if your a designer and looking to see what your design will look like on a business card before sending to the print shop. But at the cost versus benefit of these cards I would pay 10-15 $$ more and go to a cheap online print house. Their card stock will be more professional. But if you are looking to get a sample out to of a business card these will work."
4,It is good for me,"Just as described in the ad, it is clean-edge. I use a hp laser color printer, and it works very well."
2,Not worth the time,"I took a chance on this product after reading several not-so-favorable reviews. My reasoning was that I have a very nice four-color laser printer and figured maybe the alignment issues mentioned in other reviews were due to misaligned heads or cheaper printers with lazy feeders. Wrong. I have the same issues with alignment. One page will print fine and the next will not, this is really due to the fact that even off-set presses have alignment issues but are corrected in the trimming. Trying to print within such exacting parameters on every page just doesnt work well at all for single sheet fed printers. I have resorted to buying simple card stock and will print cards with corner guides and use a guillotine cutter to line it up right."
1,Not gonna happen Al....,"Sorry Al, but the chances of you becoming The Big Cheese are really slim, considering America is fed up with left-wing antics. Besides, no one in their right mind (or left mind in your case, hehe) would vote for you anyway!"
1,toooo cute...and the premise was silly.CFS is NOT depression,"Al Franken is not funny in this book. He is a character, but the plot is NOT funny. His take-off on the disease Chronic Fatigue Syndrome is also not even amusing."
4,Franken has a hilarious go at the political process,"In this book, we see Franken not as his usual politically-outspoken self but rather as another persona - a ridiculous candidate running for president, and winning in what turns out to be one of the most disasterous 100 first (and only) days of any presidency. Those who disagree with Franken's politics will appreciate the book for making fun of all ends of the spectrum in a way that generally sends up the ridiculous nature of a presidential election. Those who agree with Franken may be disappointed that he mocked everyone. However, reading the book with an open mind will probably cause a great deal of mirth and enjoyment.The book contains a bunch of sources of Franken's fictional presidency (including fictional press clippings and doctored photos). Even though the second half of the book is not nearly as funny as the first, overall, still a great read."
3,Walking through wet sand...,"I really enjoyed the book for the first 100 pages. They seemed a foray into refreshingly funny political satire.After Candidate Al takes to the road in Iowa, I found myself reading the same ""jokes"" over and over again. Kind of like a Saturday Night Live skit that's run into its third season: tried, true, but not really that funny anymore.Worth the read...when it's out on paperback."
4,"amusing, but not extraordinary","I purchased this book on eager anticipation of hearty guffaws, and was rewarded only with chuckles. Perhaps it is the current political environment, but this portrayal of the absurd seems not so unlikely in this day and age. Perhaps the next logical step in the devolution of the American political landscape is a likeable, bipolar comedian as the next President. Most amusing in this future history was the sputtering Al Gore losing the nomination to Al Franken in a marvelously wicked debate/ smear campaign. Sadly, it is probably an all too accurate portrayal of the behind the scenes machinations of a presidential campaign. I also enjoyed the no holds barred manner in which Franken manages to poke fun at everything and everyone, himself included. The humour ranges from the slapstick and coarse manner in which his brother wages political warfare, to the sublime, smug epilogue at the Franken Presidential Library. Beautifully conceived; rather hasty and slapdash execution."
5,My Favorite President,"Although he wasn't popular while in office, I think the nation is beginning to look back on his service to our country with a twinge of gratefulness and fondness."
4,Very enjoyable,"For anyone used to Al Franken's sense of humor, this is a great book. Written from the sense of Mr. Franken actually running for the White House, it follows him through the primaries, general election and beyond. Although it can be bizarre at times (Mr. Franken has that habit) it also provides some interesting insights into the great marathon to the presidency. If you are a serious conservative or die-hard republican you will probably find this book hard to read at best and offensive at worst. For all others, this books' irreverant tone is enjoyable. This is very good political satire, as long as you are not the target."
2,"Fun for insiders, dull and obnoxious for others","This would be the LAST place I would send someone to get a taste of Al Franken. The first half of the book makes the same jokes over and over and over and over again, and throughout, you really need to know a lot of Washington inside stuff to get the jokes. In some ways a sharp expose of our political and media system, and in other ways far, far, far too long with the general feel of a train wreck."
3,The Literary Equivalent of Bubblegum,"Briefly enjoyable, but with no nutritional value. Al Franken has the art of the formulaic joke down pat, but even with the big type and widely spaced lines, the book seems a little tired after 150 pages or so. I'll admit that parts of it are sheer genius, yes: the mock Newsweek story hits the nail right between the eyes, as it were.The way it's organized makes no sense at all: The book lingers on the months before the primaries start for 200 pages and then zips through the heart of the primary season, the party conferences, the fall campaign and the november 2000 elections in SEVEN skimpy pages. What's up with that?I bought it because I heard an interview Franken did on NPR where he read from the book, and it was much funnier to hear his delivery than to read the words on the page. With that in mind I'd recommend considering the Book-on-Tape version."
1,Not funny for those who know about CFS.,"He has chosen to ridicule those who have Chronic Fatigue Syndrome and for those who are afflicted with this disease it is NOT funny. Hey, I lost my job -- isn't that a scream? And I had to spend all my savings to survive -- I'm laughing so hard the tears are running down my face! And I had to apply for food stamps -- isn't that just the funniest thing you ever heard? This book is a disgusting abuse of real people who are suffering from a very real disease and who do not need to be ridiculed by this unfeeling moron."
1,Slap-dash Slapstick,"Franken's book is sophomoric, boorish, sloppy, disorganized, and pointless. While he makes a very few insightful points about politics, the majority of the ""jokes"" are stale, played-out riffs on violence, drinking/drugs, and hookers. In light of the turbulent aftermath of the 2000 election, Franken's blithe cracks about that race come across as particularly un-humorous. One of Franken's previous works, ""I'm Good Enough, I'm Smart Enough, and Doggone It, People like Me!: Daily Affirmations by Stuart Smalley,"" is a great piece of humor writing which manages to be both funny and insightful. ""Why not me?"" is neither."
2,It was uneven.,"Franken is a very funny guy with a sense of the absurd. This is not his best work. While hilarious in the beginning, it became tedious & juvenile. I didn't want to skip over anything in case it got funny again. Disappointing."
1,I used to think Al was funny...,I've always found Al Frankin to be funny until he decided to make fun of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (now known as Chronic Fatigue Immune Dysfunction Syndrome). This disabling disease with the horribly inadequate name afflicted hundreds of thousands of people including myself. It disgusts me that he finds my physical (not mental!!) suffering to be comical material.
1,why not me?,"A huge disappointment! Al Franken's zenith was on Saturday Night Live just by saying ""Hi, I'm Al Franken"". It's been mostly downhill since. Why not me really implies an inability to grasp political/comical thought."
2,Interesting piece of fiction.,"Although it's not the scathing piece of cynosure that was Franken's last book, it's decent. Franken providing his semi-raison-d`etre for the executive office. Anyone of these Republican whores (or liberal, like Franken) need to be slapped across their collective faces with a dose of reality. For example; how did free trade conseqently benefit our once sovereign country? Thanks GOP! Actually I'd like to thank both these crooked parties for slapping down a bunch of junk laws that are completely out of touch with reality. (What am I saying? The American people deserve this.)"
1,Great looking; I really liked the fake Newsweek.,Silly writing; I laughed a little. Somebody must've spent a lot of time working on all of those fake newspaper headlines. I'll bet Al Franken didn't do all of that stuff himself.
2,"Irrelevant for exam, pointless sample test","Although the quality of the information is this book is high it is not relevant to the exam. Of the 21 chapters only 4 relate to the exam. My biggest complaint is the practise test which specifically excludes the 4 chapters in question even though they are shown on the cover illustration. The reason? You have to buy this as an extra, really misleading with the phrase, ""Test your knowledge with over 100 assessment questions"" emblazoned on the cover."
5,A thoughtful book,"This is an amazingly rich and intelligent book. The author strives to give a balanced perspective on software architecture, even to the point of not being 100% pro-Microsoft. Be warned, though: the book may not sufficient to prepare you for the 70-100, as it is too heavy on COM to the detriment of other topics, and most of 70-100 stuff is relegated to exercises. IMO, it's best used in conjunction with a strictly test prep book, like Exam Cram MSCD Architectures. But overall, I rate it excellent."
4,Rear Brake Pads,Fits exactly with no issues. So far so good. Braking is quiet and good. Did not need to use the OEM shims.
5,Nobody Does It Better Than Carly Simon,"Carly's Import CD is just like all of the rest of her work; FANTASTIC! This CD has great sound quality, especially. The impressive thing about this musical heroine of mine, is that she does it all. She writes lyrics, music, sings, and plays all instruments. As a musician, she has always been my mentor and I learned so much about music from her. Don't stop at this CD, get them all! She has so much to say that will touch your heart and soul in every way possible. If you love storytellers, she is the one!"
2,Questionable C.D.,"Great Music--Carly Simon could be nothing less than spectacular. However, the imported c.d. resulted in dashed expectations. The play list does not play 1-19; but instead it plays 1, 14, 7, 12, 2, 18, 5 STOP (Push Play again); 11, 18, 14, 12, 2, 15, 6, 17, 19, 10, 7, 4, 1, 3, 9, 5, 8, and finally 16! The repeated songs and jumpy play list was a little disappointing to say the least!"
5,Hat air balloon spinner,"This hat air balloon was exactly what I wanted. It's colorful, well made and very easy to put together. I've seen these at other homes and have always wanted one. I had purchased one of similar design, but it was very poorly made and fell apart within a couple of weeks. I highly reccomend this product."
4,looks great,This is a very nice wind sculpture. Enjoyed watching it all year. Received as a gift in 2011 now a year old. Still works but has faded badly.
1,I don't like not receiving this item to review it.,I placed the original order back in July of 2010 for this item. I have been going back and forth with Best Mirror to no avail. I really don't like the fact that you purchase something and you can't get somebody on the phone for assistance. This is really bad service. I would like my money back or the item. But I can't seem to get either. I have bought many things through Amazon and I am very disappointed on this purchase.Eloy Molina.
5,A beautiful but bittersweet story of growing up.,"This is story is a beautiful in its depictions of a young girl growing up in by-gone rural Jamaica. Many local proverbs are used, but the glossary covers them all, and local traditions are described.However this is also a very sad story, of longing and questioning, as Sunshine seeks out her roots and her estranged 'Aunt Jen'.Many things happen when family members migrate to seek a better way of life. I think this book will be espescially enjoyed by persons who understand that dynamic, even if they are not West Indian."
2,Misleading Description,"Don't purchase this if you are looking for a DATED calendar. I was thrilled to find a planner that also had a full page of notebook paper on the right hand side. However, what you can't see from the photos, and is missing on at least one of the descriptions on the search engine is that this planner is UNDATED."
1,Not worth 16 bucks just go to staples and save time and money,I thought what a cool idea a left handed planner. When I got the planner it was poorly packed and the item was completely destroyed. Now I have to go to the post office and spend the money to send the destroyed product back which isn't even worth the 16 bucks. So now I have a worthless destroyed planner it would have been easier to set fire to 16 bucks and go down to staples and get an undestroyed planner which I am going to have to do now.
3,too big,"Planner is bigger than a standard notebook. It is not very practical for someone who is always on the go, like myself. If you work by a desk all day and that's where you'll be using it, then size is not a big deal."
1,From an unpurchased point of review,"It would have been nice if the item had had images, relatively close up images of it, the format, pages etc. I could not honestly make a buying decision from the word description."
1,Misleading,"I wish it would have made it clear that there are not 200 pages of actual daily planning. A bulk of the pages are information and phone logs. I was hoping to at least fit six months of planning in it, but was only able to use April - June. I am disappointed."
1,Region 2 ONLY!!!,"I ordered two copies of this DVD; one for myself, the other for a French speaking friend. It was one of the few movies I found in French with French subtitles.Because of this very French-oriented purchase, I checked that it would run on a DVD player in the United States (Region 1). The description actually read ""all regions.""I was very disappointed when the movie arrived to find it is Region 2 only and will not, therefore play on a US-made DVD player. I am returning both copies.While I cannot provide a review of the movie, I have it on good authority it is a very funny movie."
3,self help,"My wife is an avid fan, John Bradshaw's books are very easy to read and put into practice. A good book."
1,Beware of Misleading Title,"Header says alkaline, but picture and product description are not alkaline. If they are not alkaline, they won't last nearly as long and will go stale on the shelf without even being used; unlike real alkaline batteries."
1,More problems with these batteries.,"The description says 6 (six) ALKALINE batteries. The picture shows 4 (four) HEAVY DUTY batteries. In case you forgot, ""heavy duty"" means a carbon-zinc battery which is ancient technology and much less lifespan than an alkaline battery. However, if you want really cheap batteries that don't last very long, it's not a bad price."
1,Don't buy this book,"I read through the book and it's more concepts that pratical. You will find allot of managerial discussions, including talking to your users, piloting your directory and getting feedback .. etc.. - After reading the book I still have no clue how to implement LDAP ""technically"""
1,Non technical book,"After reading this book, I still could not implement LDAP . Book is mainly concepts, and allot of garbage. It'll tell you corporate garbage - like Piloting costs, staff costs etc. This is of no use in an LDAP technical book. Don't buy it !"
3,"Not for programmers or existing ldap systems, no JNDI.","I know it is focused on ""understanding"" and ""deploying"", and that there are other books specifically on programming it, but in 846 pages I would have liked to have more treatment of different use in real APIs. The explanations are too long winded for me, I usually got the point half way through and wished it would get on with it. All in all, I wanted a book that covered all of LDAP, I didn't want 3 different 800 page books. There is also basically zilch about JNDI."
4,Explains the concepts,"Though I have only read the first 3 chapters so far, I find this book better at explaining the concepts behind LDAP than Mark Wilcox's ""Implementing LDAP"". I wanted to understand more about this LDAP thing as a system designer (with a strong RDBMS background). Quite early on, the book explains the differences between directories, databases, file systems, FTP servers, DNS servers and Web servers.I found the first 3 chapters well explained, and conceptual enough for my purposes. I do intend to go back and read ""Part II: Designing your directory service"", though I probably skip the rest, which is more useful to implementors. (The rest of the book covers deployment, maintenance, using LDAP with applications, and case studies).I found the book easy to read, and would recommend the book as a general overview of LDAP that covers many angles."
2,nice cover,"This book is so typical of computer science books. There are some nice chapters (containing a lot of background information that you really don't need to know). Then, they break right into the meat of the topic (naming for example), overlooking the fact that they haven't even explained some of the most basic concepts (what is a ""dn""). Or they might use terminology in chapter 3 and explain the terminology in chapter 8, leaving you to leaf through the book like an eager little beaver who believes that you have to suffer to learn something! I'm so sick of the shabbiness of these kinds of publications!"
2,Not Technical,"The book starts by teaching the basics, but never goes beyond mere words. The title is misrepresenting: this book is little help for anyone trying to deploy a directory service. The content is only good for familiarizing those who don't know anything about directories, and it only does a fair job at that."
5,Understanding is the focus of this book.,"And that is where it excells! I have actually read this book cover to cover once, and now I use it as a good reference on LDAP. It is not exactly geared to the implementor, but rather to both the Designer/Architect as well as those who have to ""sell"" LDAP to an organization. If you are new to LDAP, or are going to be doing any sort of design work, this is the first book you should read, its introduction to LDAP is the best I have seen, and although it is weighty (and not just the size of the book) it is quite comprehendable if read in order."
3,"40 percent technical, lots of noise","Overall it's a book for people who need to get familiar and to START designing/prototyping a LDAP system without any background on the LDAP technology itself. I have to skip lots of chapters (related to general business, project management, cost control,corporate politics..) in order to understand the essential LDAP schema/attributes and the overall LDAP design patterns. The authors does give some very good real life design examples at the end. I am looking for a 'LDAP Design Patterns', this book partly ( 30% ?) covers this topic."
3,MASSIVE BOOK full of details - not for the novice,"This book assumes that you have a good understanding of LDAP and Directory Services, The intro chapters do not cover many basic concepts, many terms are not explained until used several dozen times, and there is no glossary. If you don't know what 'dn: uid=joeb, ou=People, o=foo.com' means, you will get easily confused and frustrated by this book.That said, this is an excellent reference book, contains many useful examples, and goes into great detail about LDAP and directory services."
3,Fire & Ice. .,"The book is OK. The book you sent me had been constructed incorrectly. From page 128 for about 80 pages, the pages were upside down in the book. I phoned Penguin and they told me I had to get a new book through you.I don't have the patience to deal with your return process. Why can't I call someone on the telephone."
5,"Engrossing, entertaining, wildly amusing","Maggie Estep's narrative voice shines remarkably well in this series of meticulously interconnected short stories. She's got a way with words -- so much so that even in this collection, in which she's writing through the voices of various men who go through the lives of two women, we're still listening unmistakenably to Estep's voice. And we wouldn't have it any other way. The situations in this story are often hilarious, the characters are wonderfully drawn, and the unique ways the stories are interconnected are a joy to unravel. I read it a few weeks ago, and the characters are remaining with me like I read it yesterday. A highly recommended, very entertaining book to read... try it in one sitting. It flows so nicely, you won't even realize you've just been reading for hours. Estep keeps getting better and better with every book... I, for one, am really looking forward to her next release."
3,ROLL of hole reinforcements,"It does what it is supposed to. Unfortunately, I didn't realize that it is a roll format, rather than sheets. I find the sheets much more convenient since I can keep them in the binder where I will use them. Since they didn't make this clear, two stars off."
4,It's A Toy,"I bought this to compleat a costume it did the trick everyone got a good laugh, after rehearsing with it a few times it started to fall apart but served the perpose, I'm going to buy another one and maybe make it a little stronger, but it is a toy and toys don't last long,"
1,Invisible dog leash is an bad product,"I purchased the invisible dog leash for my four year old daughter. I thought she would have a lot of fun walking an invisible dog. The harness for the invisble dog does not have a shape that imitates an invisible dog. I contacted the seller, and he told me that he could not do anything about his poorly made product. He stated: No replacement, no refund. I am highly disapointed with this product and seller."
2,Harness doesn't hold an imaginary dog shape,The leash was hard to bend into shape. It arrived folded. The harness part does not hold its shape. My husband had to duck tape pieces of a wire clothes hanger to the inside of the harness to stiffen it into shape. The manufacturer needs to treat the leather harness so that it will hold its shape. My brother had one in the 70's and I know that my parents didn't do anything extra to get it to look right.
3,Invisible Dog,"Have had lots of fun with this dog. Comes already trained, my grandchildren have really had fun playing with it."
4,Good product,"The product was bent a little due to packaging, but was no problem to fix. Just had to straighten it a little and then placed a 2 liter coke bottle in it to maintain the shape. Will work wonderful for what my child is going to do with it."
2,Arrived all bent up!,We expected so much more! Spent weeks trying to fix them. We should have put more weight on prior reports of product.
2,arrived broken,"the toy arrived broken, i fixed with 2 screws but the quality is horrible, got to give you that the toy is fun once is working.if you know how to fix things go ahead and get it"
3,It's okay,"My sisters told my little girl about some invisible dog leashes they got in Disneyland years ago and so of course she had to have one. i found this one, and it is okay, but not like the ones my sisters had. The main complaint is with the harness part, it's flat and doesn't look at all like there is a dog in it."
2,No live Sound .. just a collage of images,"Be Warned--- is not what you expect after reading the title. You ought to be a truly TD die hard fan to enjoy this DVD.. They took footage from the concert (i agree is about 10 minutes footage) and mixed it using the RICOCHET album as soundtrack.. the whole DVD is about 27 minutes long, so they repeat the images sometimes. i am very dissapointed with this one.. at least it was a chance to see the FRANKE/BAUMMANN/FROESE in action.. but what they do on the keyboards/knobs/sequencers is not what you are going to listen.. remember : The album RICOCHET is used as soundtrack."
1,dissapointed,"what a waste of my money, all this is, is a loop of T.D. playing, if you watch you can see that the playing does not even match the audio. all this is is the Richocet album tied to a live video, do not buy this product!"
1,Not very good,I was wanting to try Miso soup and thought this would be a great way to try it. It was horrible...no real flavor. But I'm not giving up on Miso soup. I just know this isn't the one for me. It also doesn't help that they don't provide any instructions in english. I know it's a product from Japan...but that had the nutritional info in english on a sticker that was placed on the package so I was surprised that the directions didn't get the same thing. But a co-worker told me that making it yourself from scratch does provide a better flavor. So I will keep trying. And even though they claim low-sodium...it is still very high but it is low for Miso.
1,Loaded with Salt,"I ordered these as they said, ""low sodium."" They are not. In fact they are very very high - and have MSG. If you are looking for tasty junk-food fix, they are fine. But, for a Miso soup on-the-fly? No way. Like a salt pellet if you already watch your intake."
1,Not satisfied with ingredients,"I was very disappointed to find when this product arrived that it contained MSG, sugar, and an artificial sweetener. I cannot comment on the taste because I did not open them and plan on trying to return them for a refund as I cannot eat these ingredients."
3,Good for understanding basics - Poor explanation and repetitive,"This book could be an introductory book on understanding J2EE design and guiding principles but beyond that you don't find much help. The book has poor editing and repetitive style of explaining concepts which annoys experienced J2EE developers. If you are looking for J2EE patterns to support real-world implementation with exhaustive details then you must consider reading Core J2EE Patterns (Alur), Core Security Patterns (Steel) and Enterprise Integration Patterns (Houpe)."
5,"Critical J2EE work, but not a general pattern book","There a general design patterns books, like the original GoF book. There are enterprise design patterns books, like Addison-Wesley's new Enterprise Patterns and MDA, which show you how to model your enterprise application. Then there is this book, which focuses on implementation patterns for enterprise class applications on the J2EE platform.My criticisms are minor. The first chapter which covers J2EE basics (probably unnecessarily) could have spent a little longer on it's description of UML. The technical points on CGI are in error, and the traffic estimates are inflated well beyond where people will see scalability issues in production, especially with resource intensive application servers.There are several critical Java design works, including Bitter Java and Bitter EJB. This book is at the level of those works. It even references Bitter Java in a later chapter on Anti-patterns."
4,Book review of J2EE Design Pattern,"It's good for me because I'm still a beginner of J2EE, its focus on using servlet, jsp and JavaBeanIt's good for me because I'm still a beginner of J2EE, it focuses the patterns on using Servlet, JSP and EJB, it told that how to determine and improve scalability and extensibility, and how to model and implement the system. It is used UML diagram for represent the pattern; some of example covers few chapters to let the content easy to study, some of code is very common for let reader reuse in different application.-calendarw"
3,Interesting but doesn't rise above partisan bias,"This book takes an interesting approach to the issue of counterterrorism, going back to WWII times and giving good historical background. Perhaps the topic is a little too broad, but the book lacks detail that has been published in other sources and little that is new. The biggest problem is that the author will gladly include any innuendo or single-source comment that is critical of a Republican president, but conveniently leaves out similar criticism of Democrats. Most notably in the case of Clinton, he leaves out the fact that Clinton was offered bin Ladin (Clinton has admitted this) but refused. The author also ignores accusations by numerous individuals close to Clinton about his failure to focus on terrorism or take opportunities to get bin Ladin. The fact that he just omits these references rather than rebutting them if he disagrees, implies a certain bias. Rather disappointing, but well-written and quite readable."
4,Straight-ahead history of modern U.S. counter-terrorism,"This is an excellent compilation of the various U.S. government responses to the threat of terrorism, starting with the end of WWII and continuing up to 9/11. It wins a ""5"" on timeliness, ""4s"" on content and writing, down-graded mainly because of puny policy recommendations. It was especially valuable to me in pointing out how vulnerable we are during the periodic interregums, as new Presidents and their minions attempt to put their own stamps on government. It was more valuable pointing out the difficulties successive Presidents and their staffs faced in trying to get authority to conduct the kinds of operations that seem to be necessary to fight terrorist acts. The tension between freedom from government scrutiny and the freedom from terrorism posed insurmountable obstacles before 2001. Finding the appropriate balance remains a key issue for this country."
3,Tread carefully,While much of this recording's content is interesting it did not add up to the satisfying musical experience some reviews had led me to expect.
3,"Less hard, more southern","After getting into this bands first release I was amped to get their second album. On the very first listen i was EXTREMELY dissapointed, I went half-way through and had to take it out. A couple weeks later i decided to give it another go, this time i started to recognize what was good and what drew me away from this band. It's simple, these guys tried to be more true to their southern roots and took out a lot of things that made them stand out. They are just another Southern rock band with slightly heavy vocals now. Dallas is an amazing vacalist, even on this album i dug most of it but it fails in comparison to his dirty and sometimes outright CRAZY screaming on their first album. Who knows, maybe this album will grow on me. Definatly worth a listen if your really into southern rock, as for old maylene fans like myself its a hit or miss. 3/5 stars."
5,Maylene and the Sons of Disaster II,"Dallas and the Sons of Disaster have a raw Southern sound that resounds throughout this CD. If you haven't seen them live, go at the first chance you get,you'll not be disappointed. If this is just the second CD they've produced ""LOOK OUT"" because this band is destined for greatness in the music industry, I cant wait for their next music colabraration."
4,Gift for Dad,I bought this as a gift for my Dad. He loves it. Light weight and it's not bulky like other life vests.
2,Too Difficult to Use,"Yes, these are soft, but they're also not paper towels you can grab for a quick spill. You need TWO hands to get these off the roll. Its like static/velcro. I hate these, and bought the bulk pack, so I have a ton to still use. Give me the traditional, rougher easy to rip towels anyday. Would not buy again!"
1,just touching it sends chills,"Very small roll, only 32 sq ft. Also, the feel of the towels is very unnerving- like touching a very dry towel. We now have 32 rolls to use and we cannot even stand to touch it"
3,GREAT for SOME uses,"If you love cloth-feeling paper towels, then THESE ARE FOR YOU! The value of these is unbeatable, to be honest. They are thick, absorbent and soft, so they are great paper towels. The only drawback is that you should not use them to clean mirrors, as they WILL leave little white fuzzies behind. That's my only complaint, and why I have switched back to the Bounty select-a-size paper towels.These are just a matter of preference, really. Probably fantastic if you have babies or kids, because of their softness. And, they DO function very well. If I had more room, I would buy them AND the Bounty, but I currently just stick with Bounty so I don't have to switch back and forth when I want to clean without the fuzzies. :) No hard feelings to Kleenex!"
2,Not as good as before,"The quality of these Viva paper towels has been degrading over the years. I have been using these same paper towels for more than 15 years now and I'm beginning to think about switching to another one. They are starting not to feel like the towels of old days, they feel more like other low grade paper towels. They do not dispense out as nicely as before and do are not as absorbent as in the past. Hope they change it back..."
5,Top of class!,"Once you use these paper towels, I doubt you could ever go back to a lesser brand. They may be a little more pricey than the store brand, etc., but they actually work! You will use one of these towels to every 4 of the cheaper brand. You can actually use these wet and they won't fall apart...like a regular towel, but one you can toss for those really yucky jobs. I love the soft feel as well. I know using a lot of paper products is not the most enviromentally friendly action, so use the best and use less.If they can figure out how to make an eco friendly version, i.e., recycled paper, etc....that would be a dream!"
5,Great paper towels!!,"I have used Kleenex Viva Towels for many years now, and each time I have to purchase another brand (for whatever reason) I find myself so very frustrated with it! Viva towels are the most absorbent, and toughest I have ever used, bar none. I am also an oil painting artist, and find them the softest, and most absorbent when I clean my paint brushes on them. They always contain the paint, never bleed through, and are very kind to my brushes. They are the most like a soft, absorbent cloth that I have found. I INSIST on Viva towels, and no other, as part of my painting tools."
3,"The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly","First, the Good: These paper towels are strong and well made. Where I once used 3 or 4 paper towels for a job, 1 of these is more than enough. Also, I accidentally washed a couple of these (in jacket pocket), and they came out like new! Unlike other paper towels that shred and make a mess in my lint filter, when I pulled these out, I thought they were small dish towels.Second, the Bad: They do leave behind lint when used for washing windows, mirrors, etc. Solution - don't use them for that.Third, the Ugly: (And this was the deal-breaker for me) They stink! The first few times I bought them, no problem. But, I've bought a couple of packages that had a very noticeable odor to them. (Another reviewer mentioned this as well). So noticeable in fact, that I quit buying them."
4,what happened to subscribe & save?,"I have gotten Viva paper towels for years in Subscribe & Save Program, now they are not available at the discounted price.What's up?"
3,Like rolls of Kleenex Tissues,"These are OK paper towels, but they are too linty and they smell funny. I prefer ordinary, residential paper towels which feel more substantial and have a more course texture. The kleenex-soft texture preferred good for face tissues and toilet paper, but not for paper towels which are generally used to dry hands or as lunch napkins."
5,"Love ""em",These are my very favorite paper towels.They will absorb so much & you can rinse them and reuse.!
2,Leaves Lint and Sticks to Microwave Food,"I've used Viva for years and after buying this new type, find it's not an improvement at all. The towels leave behind lint when cleaning glass and mirrors. I called the company to complain that they stick to microwave food. For example, the pre-made breakfast sandwiches in the grocery refrigerated section direct to wrap the sandwich in a paper towel and microwave for 45 seconds. The towel will adhere to the sandwich leaving you to pick stuck paper off your food. At times, removing it immediately works, but not always. In addition, the rolls have gone from 39.7 to 36.9 sq ft and as I read in another review are now even less."
3,I think Id rather use Bounty,"The paper towels are alright, but I think Bounty is more absorbent. Shipping was good though."
1,They smell funny,"These towels have a weird smell, not sure if it's from the cardboard box packaging or not but both me and my fiancee noticed it separately. Also, I'm not convinced of the value of these rolls as the rolls are quite small compared with what you can buy at the supermarket for the same price. Finally, they tear very easily. I don't recommend them."
1,Declining Quality a truth,"I used to use these paper towels all the time, and now they are so much thinner than they used to be and not as good. They hardly absorb anything at all and soak all the way through easily. Very disappointed in the declining quality :("
5,Great product!,We have tried many different papertowels in our Animal Hospital and nothing compares to the quality of Viva for the price. We have cut our papertowel expense in half since we started purchasing these towels. Great product!
1,Chairs Through the Ages: A Pictorial Archive of Woodcuts & Engravings (Dover Pictorial Archives),"This was ordered as a Christmas gift, which I not did not recieve until the middle of January. I am so embarrassed by the condition of the book and the lack of content I would not even consider donating it to a ""Goodwill"" type place!"
2,This Game Has Issues,"Purchased this for my husband who is a big fan of the old Close Combat Series. He did not like this as much as the original CC Series. This game locked up the computer on certain maps and crashed to the desktop on others. Checking the Matrix forums, these issues seem to be prevalent with Matrix Games. The last time I checked, no patch is provided to fix the issues in this game. Would recommend checking out the Matrix forums to see if the game you are interested in has issues. If so, see if they have made a patch to fix the issues before buying the game."
5,Sleeping Dogs Lie,"Is it better to allow sleeping dogs their eternal rest? Oedipus couldn't do it, not while the city he ruled suffered. Neither can psychiatrist Hugh Welchman, no matter how many times he is warned, when he takes on a 19 year old student terrified to descend his dormitory's stone. Nor can the reader stop turning the pages of elegant prose, a psychological thriller in which twists and turns of plot --and genre-- verge on the Gothic."
3,"Freddy's ""Trick and Treats"" Review!","I actually remember this being one of my favorite episodes of the series back in its original run. Please note that this series is really intended for the die-hard Nightmare fans.Marsha is a grad student, who despite having a fun-loving boyfriend would rather spend Halloween night, studying in the Springwood morgue. She is still haunted by memories of her psychotically-overbearing grandmother. Freddy uses her guilt over her grandmother's death to haunt her. Enter an arrogant dream supervisor who is using her to study the affects of her nightmares.While Freddy usually only shows up to host most of these episodes, this one was one of a select few episodes to actually feature him as a central character. If you didn't like the movies, you probably won't like this show but if you're a fan, you will want to add this to your collection and quick."
4,Good episode of the TV series Freddy's Nightmares.,"Jayne Mansfield's daughter, Mariska Hargitay, stars as Marsha in this bizarre Halloween episode from the first season, ""Freddy's Tricks and Treats"". On Halloween Night, Marsha would rather cram for finals with cadavers than party and pull pranks with the living. But staying awake isn't always easy. . .soon she dreams of her overbearing grandmother and the town's resident dream-psychopath. The second half of this episode deals with a college kid that uses Marsha as a ginea pig as he experiments in recording dreams. Welcome to her nightmare. . . A little confusing, but enjoyable Elm Street humor prevails."
3,Freddy's Tricks And Treats,"One of the standout episodes in the lackluster T.V. series of the late 1980's. This episode features Mariska Hargitay of ""Law & Order: Special Victims Unit"" in one of her early roles as a med student who decides to spend Halloween in a morgue studying for an exam. This particular episode is not as cheesy as most of the others and the second half of it has an intrigueing subplot involving the recording of dreams for medical purposes. Worth checking out. Co-stars Robert Englund as Freddy Krueger . It is directed by Ken Wiederhorn."
3,:/,this epsiode of FREDDYS NIGHTMARES is pretty good.well of course its not better than the movies but i was kind of dissapointedbecause in a lot of the other epsiodes there is much more bloodplus marsha should be more hott if you know what i mean
1,The Killers Leaving Las Vegas DVD,"Not a good DVD at all. This DVD is not backed by the record label so it contains none of the Killers music ( live or recorded ). they werent even able to use the font in which the killers is written in. It is a very low budget documentary with other bands music in the background and typos on the cover ( spelling unauthorised as unathorised ). dont get this DVD expecting anything direct from the band. its full of club owners, old friends and radio station djs talking about when they first came into contact with the killers."
1,Dont waste your money.,"Just a cash in on the success of the killers, you can find better information on the net. The killers would never put their name behind rubbish like this.Very little of anything, no original music and not a word from Brandan. Stay away from this one."
4,"Actually, pretty good!","I must disagree with the reviewer below/above - he's correct that this is not authorized by the band [and it's an English production, where they spell this word with an s, not a z, so this is hardly as 'typo']but the interviews on it also include early members of the group, the band's first manager and a whole lot of others who know/knew the band in the early days. It's far more illunminating than either of the biographies out there, at least these people have spoken to friends/associates etc instead of just putting together a cut and paste production. As good as anything you'd see on VH1, if you're a fan i would suggest you'll enjoy it."
3,Cheap shave set,"As I have started shaving with a double edged safety razor, I wanted to get a shave mug. As a result, I ended up purchasing this set. I would recommend that you purchase a better quality kit.The brush is stiff boar hair that does not create a later very well. I put it away as a travel backup brush.The shave soap smells good with vanilla tones, but the lather isn't impressive. Rather than throw it away, I'm now using it as bar of soap in the shower.The mug is plastic and feels cheap. It has a set of rings on the bottom of the mug to help hold a puck of shaving soap. I use the shave mug with some Van Der Hagen shave soap. This setup works fine.I wouldn't recommend as a gift for someone -- the brush is stiff and abrasive, and the soap doesn't lather well. I would recommend a cheap buying an inexpensive badger brush and a quality soap. That is what I ended up doing anyway."
4,Good product!,"Thank you for sending the mug & brush set in a timely fashion. My brother-in-law really liked it. Again, thank you."
2,Print too small,This may be a good book but the print was so small that it is very difficult to read. My husband read the first two or three pages and just gave up. We returned the book.
2,Good music but an old recording,"The Cantiones Sacrae Op4 of 1625 contains forty beautiful four-part settings of Latin texts from Psalms, Song of Solomon and medieval poets. For years the Steinitz set was the only way most of these were available. However now Cordes (CPO 999 405-2) has given them a new lease of life with five soloists, Spagele, Popken, Covey-Crump, Potter and Kooij, which is actually cheaper at Amazon.com than this slightly worn reissue. Go for the Cordes version."
3,Average,"I probably would have liked this book a little more if I had read it before I read Ravished; it just seemed like a rehash of that book, only in a medieval setting instead of nineteenth century.Also, the purple prose bordered on the silly side at times, making it hard to read with a straight face."
5,WONDERFUL!,"As usual, I can't help but fall in love with Amanda Quick's unique characters. I personally like the fact that her heroes and heroines are not the ultimate embodiment of classic perfection. I love the fact that the women are intelligent and the men are smart enough to appreciate it. Alice is smart, competent, and loyal and Hugh is masculine, intelligent, and amazingly sensitive to the emotional needs of others without becoming a wimp. Highly recommended!"
4,"Fun, easy read!","The early Amanda Quick novels are fun, easy to read and involve enjoyable characters. Mystique is one of these! Good plot, good secondary character development and good hero and heroine!"
4,Enjoyable read,I really like Jayne Krentz/Amanda Quick. In my opinion she is a very good writer. Her plots are good and you can really lose yourself in the story. This book was quick paced. I enjoyed the history of it-it felt accurate. Krentz/Quick usually has good female lead characters. This lead character was strong but seemed historically accurate. There were some parts in the story that were suspenseful and a couple others that were humorous.
2,GIVES BLAND A NEW MEANING---,"This book had absolutely nothing to offer...flat words about flat characters dealing with a flat plot all on very flat pages. There was not a hint of life ANYWHERE. I couldn't even work up enough emotion to hate it, it was so darn bland."
5,OH I JUST LOVE THIS BOOK,"I could put in down. I read this book in one day and reread it the next day. It was so wonderful. I love how Alice found away to deal with Hugh, and I love how Hugh was able to handle Alice without being mean. I love this book and I recommend that anybody who appreciates a funny,canningly written plot to read this novel. If I could rate this book a 10 I would."
4,Thoroughly covers its topic,"Upon reading this book, one finds that it's very clear the author is extremely supportive of the use of Kangaroo Care to cure just about whatever may ail your premature baby. Despite the repetitiveness of this, the book is chock-full of just about everything you'd need to know about Kangaroo Care.I also found it was quite informative in the realm of not only the care of preemies (and their signs of distress/contentment), but of full-term infants as well. So, if you're wondering how best to help your small and/or sick baby in the NICU, or are wondering just what benefits the act of such skin-to-skin contact can bring to both you and your full-term newborn, the book is a very good--and helpful--read."
1,Very slow to ship... frustrated customer...,"This book seems to ship out EXTREMELY SLOW. I have paid for 2 days shipping but it has been MANY days since I have placed the order and the book has not shipped yet... It is a great book overall, and I have enjoyed having it when my daughter was born at 29 weeks 6 yrs ago... I am ordering it for a friend who has a just born preemie and I can't get the book to her fast enough... Very frustrated.."
4,"Colorful, convenient","I love the crisp, clean look of my organized binder. I used the Avery template with success but had a bit of difficulty navigating it. You will have an attractive, neat result with this product. The colors may not be suitable for all applications but they work very well for me with the organization of my graduate studies as well as the organization of the resources in my classroom. In both instances the vivid colors are beneficial. My only concern would be in making the site more user friendly."
5,"I read the book, bought the DVD","This is what drama, either black or white, or Hispanic should be, whether on network or cable television. To see familiar faces such as TK Carter (Saved by the Bell), Sean Nelson (The Wood), Tasha Smith, and others, it was refreshing to see the humanity of people of color dramatised by Charles Dutton. Get this, read this, treasure it!"
5,Just like the book,I'll be honest and bought this only because I had to read the book for a paper and presentation. It is pretty much verbatim to the book. Every main conflict and storyline is in the movie.
5,Great Documentary,This documentary is a good watch if you're truly interested in what actually goes on in the world of heroin addicts in the urban neighborhoods. This documentary was done in a way that it makes you see and feel the reality of what's going on in the world of poverty along with the drug use that people tend to turn to when they feel that they don't have any other way.
4,The Corner,This was an excellent movie to watch. It shows the reality of drug addiction without sugarcoating anything. I felt that it also showed a sense of hope to those who are caught up in the throws of addiction.
4,The Corner,"Gritty, harrowing, human.We bought it because we loved The Wire, and found it as compelling, although it is not as complex as that show, it's scope is as you would expect is restricted to life on ""The Corner"" and the light and shade which is part of the Wire is not as evident."
1,Utterly boring,"One of those films that starts off boring, continues boring, but you live in hope that something interesting will finally happen. It doesn't. Lousy acting by ""unknowns,"" bad script, no redeeming features. Give it a miss!"
2,drum kit,"i checked the compatibility with my car and this and they said it would wrk with my car, but it didn't. Be careful when ordering car parts."
2,Old and incomplete.....,"THE PROFESSIONAL' S BOOK OF LOVEBIRDS by John Coborn covers their natural history, cages and aviaries, nutrition-health and hygiene-breeding Lovebirds and other topics. Coburn provides suggestions for aviaries and cages and recommends aviaries because Lovebirds are ornamental birds, not necessarily good companion animals (although I have a very loveable Peach-faced (Agaponis roseicollis) Lovebird hand raised from a young chick).Coburn's book includes over 180 color photographs and large type, so it is certainly visually appealing and relatively easy to read, although perhaps a bit dated (the suggested reading section won't include anything issued after 1991). For a surfeit of information about genetics and typology, Dr. D'Angieri's ATLAS on Lovebirds can't be beat, but for more comprehensive albeit easier to access and handle smaller book, you may want to buy Anne Appleyard's THE LOVEBIRD HANDBOOK published in 2001."
5,One of my favourite Bossa Nova album,"I have more than 20 titles of Bossa Nova music, from Jobim's play to Ono Lisa. This title ""Day in New York"" is one of my favourite. I suggest all Bossa Nova lovers should have this one. The most impressive paly is ""Chega de Saudade"", the best version I've ever heard. The whole feeling is just right! Very wild and sexy singer and players."
3,"This is great for my kit, but not as sturdy as I prefer.","When I compare this to other palettes that I have used it feels flimsy. This can be good for the total weight it adds but bad because the white plastic inserts don't seem like they would hold up in air travel well. I did not hot pour my lipsticks into this because I was afraid it might warp. I just used a spatula and swabbed in into place, then used a label maker to add the swatch names to the divider. I think this is just ok, nothing to rush out and buy, there is probably a better option out there."
2,Poor followup to Hammerfall,"Covers too many people and almost all on the station overhead. The planet's given short shrift and one main character supposedly an immortal has totally disappeared. Meanwhile, she's back to writing too much, spending too much time with trivial or overworked through processes of the characters.The concepts aren't bad, but they only take up a much shorter amount of text than has been used. If less space had been taken up on Concord and the trivial details and more on the politics and environmental changes on the planet I think it would have been much more balanced and interesting."
5,The book that most everyone needs to take the time to read,This book gets right to the point of the story meaning.You get to read first hand of what this person had to sufferwith when they were a smoker.The cost of there nasty habbitnearly took there life before they could seek the right help.
1,DONT BOTHER... FALLS APART... DOES NOT WORK NOR HOLD ANY WEIGHT,THOUGHT THIS WOULD HELP TO ORGANIZE MY SONS CLOSET... CHILDRENS CLOTHING... BUT IT DOES NOT HOLD ANY WEIGHT... AND IT IS POORLY MADE
5,Freed up so much space,"My one-year-old and I share a closet, and this freed up so much space. I even managed to empty out one of my son's dresser drawers AND put some of his toys in this closet organizer. Thinking of getting something similar for myself next..."
4,Good product but not whats shown,The item that is shown is a little bigger and a different color than what I recieved but what I recieved is still a good product plenty of space to store items but I do agree with another review that there should be a panel on the back of the top so we could us that space for storage as well.
1,Horrendus,"This is an awful [movie]. Very few attractive girls. Very little nudity. What nudity exists is of average looking girls, far away, and tame. They even have a long segment of a guy doing it with a doll. Horrible. The worst. ..."
1,as primitive as possible,"Yes, it is as primitive as it is possible could be. I did see Sex court on Playboy channel and it was entertainment especially music.Now, movie done as soft-core so even masturbation done under the sheets, lighting very primitive, plot--none, presented positions more suitable for first-timers of first dates, fake tities not impressive at all etc. Brrrr."
2,wrong batteries,I ordered these batteries for a sony cybershot model DSC-S930BDL and what i received will not fit in my camera. they are too big to slide into the battery slot. if you will send the correct batteries for my camera i will send these back. thank you
5,Hilarious and heartfelt,This was the funniest book I ever read.It had a real cool plot too.I give it 5 stars and two thumbs up.It was really great
5,FFFFUUUUUNNNNNNNNNNNYYYYYYYY!,"I loved this book! Marco's point of view seems much more real than the others. And that bit where he's in dog morph at the concert and that gir's scratching his ears is brilliant! The bit with his dad when they were eating was a bit weak, but the rest was great!"
5,EXTRA!! EXTRA!! READ ALL ABOUT IT!!,Marco was really funny. I told my cuz (cousin) about them and now she is very curious!
5,Animorphs- <Together we fight>,"This book ranks 3rd in my Animorphs ratings. On funniest, it is #1. The funniest part was when Jake said, ""Hey, here's a topic for you- the use of total bull in the writing of English papers"", then Marco said, ""I am the master of bull."" then Jake said,""Topic- the use of rhetoric to obscure a lack of content."" ""That's brilliant!! It means the same as the use of total bull, but it sounds so much better!!"""
5,One of the best,"In this book, Marco and Jake discover an old friend of Marco's named Erik handing out flyers for the Sharing. They discover that he is an android created by the long-dead Pelmites, and though hard-wired for nonviolence, the Chee hate the Yeerks and act as spies for the ANIMORPHS."
5,Fabulous!!!!!!!,"This book was fantastic!! I loved it!! Of course, I love all Animorph books!! It was weird, crazy, and insane all at once!! KA Applegate is the best author ever! She did a fantastic(times 100000000000000000 more)Buy this book! Or the Yeerks shall get you."
1,"Cheap materials, poorly built, poor customer service","I was fooled into buying this grill as it looks nice. The initial excitement did not last very long. The ignition never worked. After only a few months of occasional use, the front piece of my grill caught fire. The control knob melted, and I was unable to turn of the gas. I could finally stop the fire by turning off the gas cylinder. The grill is no longer usable.The grill is still under warranty. This is what customer support had to say:Informed customer that they experienced a flashback fire, and is not covered under warranty. Case will be reopened if any further assistance is needed. r.s.I wish I had known about this product's poor quality and also about this company's poor customer service."
2,"instructions, lite sheet metal and hooking to tank",JUNK structally will fold end to end unless you keep kids off.The instructions had to written for a differt eqt.Who ever thought you can put a tank in place from behind tighten up their bolt and then crawl like a snake to try to hook tank on TOO short a hose going to regulator. Unless you try this eqt you are missing something stupidy.It cooked well after I installed two x braces only after.AMAZON.CON you have lost a customer because of your lack of telling people like it is.
1,Buyer Beware! Make sure you have seen this unit in person before you purchase it and this is really what you want!,"Without trying to sound overly negative this is subpar engineering and production at its finest. First, I was expecting something that would assemble ""in minutes""... guess when you dont qualify how many that years are also broken into ""minutes"".. this unit has roughly 60 individual pieces that require assembly not including nuts and bolts. Finish was VERY poorly applied and rust was already visible on the carbon steel on the underside of the side burner. Guage of steel for the cart assembly is subpar. Amazon has been very good to deal with and is refunding my puchase and returning the grill. There are many better systems available out there than this. Very disappointing merchandise and misleading advertising on the manufacturers end. I made the mistake of buying prior to any of these units being available locally because I thought I was getting a good deal."
2,Burner leaked and not hot enough,"One of the burner knobs developed a leak causing flame to melt the cladding around that burner. Also, this grill just doesn't get that hot. The temperature guage goes up to 500, bu mine rarely gets to the ""grill"" zone."
3,nurse anesthesia,I graduated almost two years ago as a CRNA and I was second in my class. I don't consider myself stupid but I still found this book to be extreemly hard to read. Can't anyone write an anesthesia textbook that I can understand!
3,Good basic nurse anesthesia overview,"This book provides a good overview of nurse anesthesia practice. Not as indepth or specific as others I've used, but it is a good starting point and excellent resource to refer back to during clinical practice."
5,Love it!,"It taste great and is the only vitamin my husband will take. Its very quick and convenient to use, the only down side is its a lil pricey!"
4,Great account of a misunderstood battle,"This account (of a battle that everyone's heard of but nobody knows much about) drags a bit in its beginning and ending sections, but its middle(the actual description of the battle) is a well-paced, crystal-clear description of the battle action of both sides. Good depiction of how individual leaders and their strengths and weaknesses influence military actions. The attempts to place the battle in a much larger historical context sometimes were a stretch, but the book overall is a great read for Civil War history buffs."
4,Dave Navarro is good...,"But I think this album is not a typical RHCP. Dave's style is more metal than the funky Mr Frusciante. One Big Mob and Walkabout are fun, and there are of course the big blockbuster tunes like Coffee Shop, Aeroplane and My Friends. But there's some slow sections in the album and any guitar player that uses as distorted a sound as Dave N really does so at the expense of a recognizeable sound. I heard this is Flea's ""Divorce"" album and much of it was written by him after or during a breakup. The album is nicely produced and there's plenty of quality stuff plus lots of hits, but for me it remains unsatisfying. Blood Sugar is THE RCHP album. By the way the Chili's recorded Love Rollercoaster by Ohio Players for the film ""Beavis and Butthead Do America"" and is likely only available on that soundtrack. It's pretty well an EXACT copy of the song."
4,I actually have a question..,"I'll appreciate an answer from anybody who knows: Did the Red Hot Chili Peppers record and release a version of Ohio Players' ""Love Rollercoaster?"" Not too long after One Hot Minute, somebody did a version of Rollercoaster and it sounded a lot like the peppers. does anybody know what I'm talking about?"
1,"Worked badly, and no customer support","I hooked up this video card to my LCD monitor and got vertical bands of fuzziness. Updated to the latest stuff with Windows Update; latest DirectX; latest ATI drivers. Couldn't get it fixed. Diablotek did not return my customer support voicemails or e-mails. I contacted ATI customer support online, who actually had humans respond after a while, but their suggestions didn't work. I'm not sure if this particular card is defective, or if it's a defect in the product design that ensures that no replacement card will work with my monitor, but since there was zero customer support from Diablotek, I'm not trying with them again, and of course won't buy anything from them in the future(tm)."
4,oh bay whats legs,what a siory this a good hollwood read loved it want more thanks for a good journey loved it jean tilly
5,almost famous,"a fascinating journey around the world by a hollywood character skip e lowe great love it and always loved his t.v show ita good book . its a provactive story . love it ,thanks skip for telling us."
5,A WONDERFUL PAGE TURNER WITH LEGS,"Skip E. Lowe's autobiography, 'The Boy with The Betty Grable Legs' runs a high speed race through his life and it is on avery fast track. No flagging, no dragging, no sagging.This book, like Skippy, moves with olympic energy and soulsharing humanity. With laughs, gaffs and shafts, there is nowaiting to get to the good parts. Every page is alive with astory that is immediately satisfying.I was intending to politely browse the book but Skippysnags my interest from the very first page and doesn't let me go.I felt I graduated a speed reading course, it reads so fast.What a life Skippy has led! It can't be true!Not that he has adventured with great names and far awayplaces that we can only dream of, but that he has actedon convictions where most only moralize.If you meet him, he's small.If you know him, he's giant."
5,The Boy with the Betty Grable Legs,"Having been a child actor myself, I could well relate to the tale masterfully told my Mr. Skip E. Lowe. What a story!~What I loved most about Skip's life story was that he did it all himself! Travelling the world on no money except what you make at the clubs takes guts baby!Those who follow their hearts desire and explore the road less travelled always win my heart. Skip is a wonderful man, a sort of little wizard. Skip e Potter. HA! I laughed so hard at certain points of the book that I peed my bloomers. Sometimes, it was so sad I cried a river of tears.But it was always haute entertainment. I sincerely recommend the Boy with the Betty Grable Legs for all lovers of life, travel, bohemia, and the great show people and the great, great legends, (our teachers) like Skip E!"
2,Not up to the rest of the series,"In a series that seems to get better with each book, this one just doesn't click. The characters are underdeveloped, the atmosphere is flat, and St. James' and Kincaid's involvement in the case is contrived and completely unrealistic."
3,Now May You Weep,"I am a huge fan of the series and have contacted Deborah to praise her writing on previous Kincaid/James titles but this one missed the mark. Duncan and Gemma were flatine, their growth arc non-existant, Gemma was unrecognisable and Hazel's 'past life' did not ring true knowing her as we do through this series,the storyline was forced and contrived, the back story did not contribute to the mood as in the other novels. I re-read the book prior to posting and still feel the same.Hopefully book 10 in this series tentatively titled 'One Blood Will Tell' gives us back the texture on which this series was built."
1,Appropriate title.,"This is the ninth installment in the Gemma James/Duncan Kincaid Scotland Yard series with our heroes on the outside of a murder investigation involving Gemma's good friend and ex-landlord as a prime suspect. This book has the template of this series' earlier entries - the weaving of plots past and present, a cast of characters tied together in a murder investigation and Gemma and Duncan balancing police work with their personal relationship and children. What is blatantly absent is a gripping story line. There are love triangles aplenty, more than enough information for this reader on the distillery industry and plenty of conversations about food but the murder mystery never gains any traction. If you are new to this series, start at the beginning for this addition contains none of the subtlety, complexity and depth of those very good books."
4,flower pot does the job,"Since the stone urns are so expensive, I decided to try a fiber glass one and it looks nice. It works fine and is a good substitute for the stone."
3,lokks good but is cheap,"My mistake, I didn't read the description well enough and was very surpriused at the thinness of it. Added to that was the toal cost as I was charged almost as much to ship it as I paid for it! No great deal there!"
1,Terrible book -- don't buy it.,"I purchased this book a few weeks ago. Suffice it to say, it has been very easy to put down. I've read about 100 pages of the book (over a few days, since it was on the dull side -- usually I can devour books of this length overnight).The characters are uninteresting and undeveloped, the plot seems to be going nowhere and Mr. Robinson's attempts at being amusing are not funny. I could not help but get the sense that the author dashed off this book over a weekend in sloppy style and that it didn't go through any editing.I would urge people to avoid this book. I feel like a fool for picking it up in the first place."
1,Very Sneaky Design,I've had this product for about a year. While it was working it was great. One day it would no longer cook rice. The switch would not stay on. I took apart the machine and found out why. All of the wires inside were screwed down except one. One of the wires was GLUED down on the bottom of the pot. My guess is that after using it everyday the heat finally made the glue come off. I found a screw around the house that fit and screwed it on myself (there's a hole). It's working for now but I'm now currently looking for a replacement.
2,Not so good,"I was very excited to find a rice cooker that had a stainless steel interior. This was the only one I could find.It arrived very quickly and well packaged. The seller was great. Sadly the product wasn't.As soon as the cooker arrived I put it to use. The instructions, as previous reviewer mentioned, were a bit hard to undestand. I consulted a friend of mine who grew up in Japan and uses a rice cooker everyday to make sure I was using this one correctly. Fresh out of the box I noticed the switch was very loose. It took a few tries to get it to start cooking. This should have been my first clue something wasn't right. About 30 minues later, I smelled burning. The rice was burned to the bottom and the cooker never shut off. This was very disappointing.I felt the quality of this product was very poor. The seller was very accomodating on the return. They were great. The product stinks. Don't buy this one."
4,Victorian Vapours,"""Victorian Vapours,"" and the other books in the Smelly Old History series, provide a fun way to expose the reluctant history student to some aspects of history. Dobson provides seemingly accurate information on some of the more common aspects of daily life during the Victorian period. The books are quite enjoyable and recommendable."
1,Bad Battery,I ordered this battery as a replacement for the one in my security system. Installed and forgot for a few days. Decided to check it out and found it had leaked! Not only is there acid on the wall but also on my $200 gore-tex fishing jacket!!! Contacted the seller and they said they could only offer me $45 because that's all Amazon will allow. Not very happy...
5,Excellent,"I thoroughly enjoyed this novel - I thought it was just stunning. I particularly liked the characterization of Elizabeth Middleton Bonner...there is nothing quite like a good, strong, fiesty female character (Curiousity is pretty cool as well)! Elizabeth reminded me a lot of Diana Gabaldon's character, Claire Fraser - so it was a real thrill to see Claire briefly mentioned in the tale! The detailed descriptions of life back then, especially the Indian way of life, are fascinating. I can't wait for the sequel, so I can find out if: Elizabeth's babies are born safely, if Kitty marries Richard and whether the Bonners leave Paradise for Scotland etc. I must say I was surprised to see Julian, Moses Southern and Billy Kirby killed off - who are the villians going to be in the sequel??"
5,This book is a must read!!!,"If you like to read books to escape, this book is better than a calgon bath. Elizabeth and Nathaniel take us exploring around Paradise, Albany, Johnstown, and my personal favorite, into the bush. Ms. Donati's descriptions makes you feel as if you are there and can smell the fresh cooked venison. Her characters have so much substance to them, you wish you were sitting around a campfire, or at the trading post, swapping stories.The only negative is that I have to wait until fall of 1999 for the sequel."
2,Unlovable feminine characters,"A lot have been said about this book, I just want to forewarn you that at the end of the series, if not at the end of this first book, you will probably be hating most of the female characters. Even Elizabeth, the heroine in this book turns increasingly selfish and irrational. To say noting of her brood. These female characters are reckless instead of adventurous and hysteric instead of bold. It makes me think that the author has a very low opinion of our sex, or is she maybe too realistic? I, myself prefer my better qualities to be part of the heroine's personality. This is fiction, entertainment, it suppose to be a pleasure to read, not a torture."
5,A wonderful writer!,"When I started reading this book, I picked it up because I had nothing else to read. This is a wonderful series told in a masterful way. Sara Donati is a wonderful story teller!"
2,"good historical detail, bad writing","I can't believe so many people loved this book. the subject matter is interesting & I thought the historical detail was done well, but most of the characters are completely one-dimensional - either very, very good or impossibly evil. and daniel was really annoying after awhile - so sensitive, great lover, great warrior, great body - totally unbelievable. does this author really teach creative writing?"
1,Absolutely Awful,"I couldn't finish this book, it was so asinine, and the references to Outlander were just rediculous. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone."
5,Enjoyed every bit of the entire series!,Each book in this series left me waiting for the next. Extremely well written.. kept me interested from start to finish.
2,2 1/2 stars because I finished it,"I liked the setting of the book. The characters were good, it was just how he ended up having so much money, it was ridiculous."
2,"Interesting, but really not worth my time","I did not really enjoy this book. The characters are shallow and underdeveloped, the book whisks through important scenes too quickly, and the plot itself has way too many things going on. I hope the next one is better."
2,A bit long and boring,"I had the highest hopes for this book, but alas, it let me down. In the acknowledgements, the author thanks JF Cooper and S Clemens. That's just pretentious to thank two famous American authors (James Fenimore Cooper and Mark Twain). She also borrows characters from Cooper. Although this is an ambitious attempt to write a sequal to Cooper's ""Last of the Mohicans,"" it isn't a very good attempt. While the historical facts, Mohican language etc, is correct, I just don't care to read about a ""uncomfortable tightening in Hawkeye's breaches."" If you're interested in a sequal to Cooper's books, try the rest of the Leatherstocking series, if you're looking for a epic romance novel involving Native Americans, try ""She Who Hears the Sun"" by Pamala Jekel."
2,Is it plagarism?,"It's disconcerting to read the first chapter of Sara Donati's book, ""Into the Wilderness,"" if you've read James Fenimore Cooper's ""The Pioneers."" Where does paraphrase end and plagarism begin? Donati tones down and re-names Cooper's characters and then re-casts the plot. I wonder what he would have thought of having his story twisted into a historical romance."
1,"Trite, inauthentic","The book starts off promising enough, but after about a hundred pages or so, you realize you are dealing with simple, one-dimensional characters. The good people are very, very good, and the bad people are very, very bad, with no gray area or subtlety in between.Naturally, the Indians and black people are all kind, noble, intelligent and brave. The bad white people are vicious, venal, murderous and stupid. Like most dull novels, there is also a contrivance which makes our heroes almost invulnerable.I was initially attracted to this novel because it takes place in 1792 upstate New York, but other than there being a lot of trees and lakes, one never gets the sense of colonial America. At least, one never gets the sense of colonial America beyond what one has already learned from grade school texts. This could have taken place in 1892 or 1692, or, in the way Nathaniel is cupping his hand around Elizabeth's breast every thirty pages or so, 1992.I gave up"
2,Bland,"I read the book with some interest, I would daze in and out of the 2 dimensional characters as I skipped pages of endless description. A lot of the book was descriptive to the point of ""what's the point?' The villan was not too threatening, the main characters were boring and I did not get a real grasp on who they were, I wish Ms. DOnati would have spent as much time developing the characters as she did their intensive family tree. Yawn."
2,Couldn't Stick It Out,"I love historical fictions and own many, some better than others. This book, however, is not even fit to be called a historical fiction- it is a trashy romance novel with flat characters and a predictable storyline thinly veiled with some pretty descriptions of a New York wilderness in the attempt to pass for a historical fiction. I got halfway through Part II and decided that enough was enough. I agree with other reviewers, the few wilderness descriptions were very well done but the plot and characters were so poorly developed and so very predictable that the whole novel fell through. Not only a waste of my time, but an embarrassment on my bookshelf."
5,Why did I wait so long?,"That is what I had to ask myself after completing Into The Wilderness. I have had this book on my shelf for many years and thanks to a small group on online reading friends, I had the push I needed to open it up and start reading. Right from page one I was hooked on this epic tale of love and adventure with Elizabeth and Nathaniel back in the pioneer days. If you love romance and historical fiction this is definitely the book for you. I can't wait to read the rest in the series now."
3,Loved the story,"I really enjoyed reading this book. I hated to put it down! I did not like the detailed love scenes. Is this a must in every love story? Also, I like a sequel, but I don't enjoy having to read the next book to have questions answered. Other than that, I liked the characters, and the story line."
1,Did not enjoy,After reading outlander I heard this was a good series. Well they were wrong I could not even finish the book the writing was unrealistic and the action was lame. I kept reading hoping for more and made it little over half and still could not keep my interest. I was disappointed especially after reading so many good reviews. After outlander I have high expectations.
1,Horrible - Couldn't get through the first 50 pages,"This is the first review I have ever written - However, I felt inclined to do so since I rely on others' reviews so often before I purchase a book. The reviews on here are very misleading. The book is horribly boring and the writing is elementary and lacks any detail. The whole book comes down to boring romance between a 29 year old ""spinster"" as the book calls her and a widowed native who wants his ""own land"". I tried my hardest to get into the book and ended up just leaving at the gym. I am a fan of Gabaldon and can't believe anyone ever compared the two authors."
1,"Gabaldon wannabe,","I think Sara Donati is a Gabaldon wanna be. At least Into the Wilderness suggest she is. In my opinion, Sara Donati should have picked andother writer to copy. I didn't like this story and if it makes her feel any better, I didn't like Gabaldon story either. I thought both stories were flat and yes even boring! Sorry! Next time you want to copy after someone Sara at least pick an author that is exciting, check out Laura Leone books, or perhaps Linda Howard's."
3,"FAIR, FOR A FIRST EFFORT","Dispite a few flagrant errors that I would attribute to the author being a ""First Timer"" this book does have a decent story line and very good characters. She uses a few reference to ""The Outlander"" saga as a tribute(?) The main character of Elizabeth however, left me cold and I never managed to make a true conection with her. All in all a tolarable book which indicates the posibillity of better things to come from the author, but 'Dianna Gabaldon' she's not."
2,Not Impressed,I'm just not impressed and Donati is no Gabaldon! I really tried to like this book but found it mostly boring. There were some good parts but it was really just not very good. I thought that the characters were poorly developed and the story lines and characters that were interesting were glossed over in favor of the less interesting plotlines in this long road to nowhere.
3,A few misconceptions....,"I like many other Diana Gabaldon fans heard about the 'Claire Fraser cameo' and went to particular pains to find and read this book. I would advise anyone else to read this series cold b/c I was influenced by the comparison with Ms. Gabaldon's exceptional work. It is great in historical detail, but much more like a traditional epic romance and I found myself wishing for a bit more depth and substance to the characters and writing. The one big thing that threw me off was that this 'sequel' to 'The Last of the Mohicans' is actually for the movie version not the classic by James Fenimore Cooper. For one thing, Cora Munro dies in the original story with Uncas, and there is no mention of Hawkeye marrying anyone. So, hopefully this with help people understand that reading the original, which was in no way a romance, will not be helpful for the backstory of Hawkeye's family."
1,A Gabaldon fan that was sorely dissapointed!,"I can't believe all the hype about Donati's first book. Like so many other people, I only read it because of the comparisons reviewers have made to the simply amazing Outlander series by Diana Gabaldon (which I simply adore!). I never got the feeling that I could relate to the characters, the plot was sooooooooo incredibly unoriginal, and it lacked the extensive research and creativity that made Gabaldon's books such a great read. Don't read this book if you're expecting Gabaldon-style writing because you'll be in for a huge dissapointment."
1,Not a sequel!,"Sorry, I am just too skeptical, but this book is *not* a sequel to James Fenimore Cooper's novel. It's more a sequel to the movie of the same name which starred Daniel Day-Lewis and which depicted a completely different story from the novel. Donati invents a marriage between Hawkeye (whose name in the novel is Nathaniel ""Natty"" Bummpo--a.k.a. ""La Longue Carabine"" and ""Hawkeye""--not Daniel Bonner...) and Cora Munro (who DIES in the novel...therefore could not be a mother to anyone!), and invents them a son as the hero for her tale. I suppose the book is OK in and of itself, but it shouldn't be billed as a sequel to Cooper. I'm not sure why she made use of Cooper at all--which is the same thing I always wondered about the Day-Lewis film. If you're going to depart substantially from an earlier author's work, why not depart completely?"
5,great stuff,"I read the sequel first and ran out to get this one. Hope she writes ten mmore!I hope nobody comes looking for me with a rifle when I say this, but I liked these books better than the Gabaldon stories. Time travel just isn't for me, I guess. But it was a good joke to run into the characters."
2,"good effort, good descript.,poor plot, poor characterization","Things I liked: 1. Description of nature, I felt as though I really were there. Those who appreciate these things will definitely appreciate this book. 2. The grits and determination it takes to even attempt a historical novel. Bravo to those who can do it. It keeps readers like me entertained. 3. The 20th century Elizabeth who rules the roost. WINK -not typical for those times, but it's only fiction.Things I didn't like: 1. The storyline (not terribly engaging) 2. The characters lacked depth and humanity. They ranged from stock characters ""Julian"" and ""Richard"" to near perfect protagonist ""Nathaniel"" and ""Robbie"" 3. The constant description of nature. Some of those description could have been better used in developing the characters, refining them, breathing life into them."
5,An Excellent and Exciting Story!,"A heart-palpitating adventure and a wonderful love story to boot! This is one of those books where you call into work sick, disconnect your phone, ignore your e-mail, and let the plants/spouse/pets or other critters you live with fend for themselves. Quite an intelligently-written book; the characters are well-developed, the plot is excellent, the love story moving, and the scenery beautiful. Enjoy!!"
4,True Romance,"I truly enjoyed this entertaining book about rebelion , change, but most importantly love. this book is about a woman who risks losing everything for the man she loves. this long book is really worth-while and i recomend it to anyone who enjoys a long story."
4,Into the wilderness,Enjoyed it immensely couldn't. Put the book downRecommend it to anyone who lies American history around the revolutionary war
2,Umm.....No,"I was so excited to read this series. I ordered the first two books in hardcover because I thought they were going to be keepers. Now I'm trying to figure out who I dislike enough to give these books to. I am only 200 pages into the first book, but I think I should cut me losses and stop torturing myself. I do not like any of the characters and at this point, I couldn't care less if the main charactes get together or just drop dead. I always finish books. It is almost a compulsive thing with me that I have to finish a story, but this is one of the rare occasions where I am going to have to make an exception and just call it quits."
5,Could Not Put This Book Down,"This is one of the most well written books I've read in ages. The story picks up with the son of Dan'l Bonner, the surviving son from Last Of The Mahicans and Elizabeth, an educated English woman of Society.Their relationship is at the core of the story, and yet there are so many other interesting characters and the interwoven story lines make this book impossible to put down. If you really want to get away from it all, this is the book for you. Before I even finished it I ordered the other four books in the series."
4,Pretty good read,"Not as good as Gabaldon, whom I have often seen Donati compared to. I really enjoyed this book more than the sequel. Great historical fiction, and the romance between the two is tender. I'm not sure I'd spend the money on the hardback, but the paperback is well worth the price."
2,IT CAN'T COMPARE TO OUTLANDER,"I FOUND IT A BORING READ, AND ACTUALLY RETURNED IT WHEN I HAD READ ABOUT SEVENTY FIVE PAGES. I AM AN HISTORICAL ROMANCE WRITER (SOON TO HAVE A BOOK OUT) AND HAVE READ BETTER AUTHORS. SUSAN JOHNSON D MARY BALOUGH, JUDITH MCNAUGHT ALL COME TO MIND AS BEING FAR MORE EXCITING WRITERS. DO YOU WANT A REAL FINE REGENCY HISTORICAL? READ MCNAUGHT'S WHITNEY, MY LOVE. THIS WAS HER FIRST HISTORCAL AND VERY WELL WRITTEN!"
1,When will it end,"It just goes on and on. The more I read the more I disliked it. Something is missing. It should be exciting, but even during tense situations, it was dull. I guess this book is for the real fans. I actually gave up about half way through which is rare for me. Oh well on to the next book. Of course it's personal, some I like and some not so much."
3,Not impressed,"I was so not impressed with this book. The main character is annoying and unlikable. She just never stops talking. The entire plot is predictable and contrived. It's almost painful to complete the book and then you finally get to the end and it continues in another book. Aaaach! Diana Gabaldon is ten time the writer but if you like to read mindless fluff, this book is for you."
3,Into The Wilderness,"Elizabeth Middleton arrived in New York to live with her brother and father. Nathaniel Bonner is like no other white man Elizabeth had ever met. Sara Dontai paints her story through these characters. She puts you in the middle of the frontier that is raw and cold. Then she takes you through the hardships of the time. A good read. Ruth Thompson author of ""The Bluegrass Dream"""
3,"Not bad... Also, not Outlander","I started this book immediately after finishing the latest available Outlander series book, was looking for something similar to the style and time period to get my fix. It wasn't as bad as I feared (after reading some reviews) and not as good as I hoped. Overall, I'd say it was good enough to get me to buy the 2nd book but won't go down in history as a favorite."
2,too much,there were way too much stretched complications. i wasn't able to take this book to heart. it was just not worth reading or spending my time on.
3,I enjoyed the book!,"I enjoyed the book, despite the flaws. I found the story and the glimpses of early life-style in this country to be interesting. The characters were well imagined. One gets tired of Elizabeth's longing and Nathaniel's vulnerability after a while, however. What I really didn't like was the cheesy use of other writer's characters. She might have gotten away with using Cooper's characters, but the reference to Galbaldon's was not necessary and mildly distasteful. This writer is not the equal of Gabaldon or Cooper but has promise. I will read the next in the series. If it turns out to be a romance in disguise, I will stop there."
2,"Disappointing, disjointed waste of time","I loved the Gabaldon books so I was so interested to read Sara Donati who is recommended by fans of Gabaldon. Donati is no Gabaldon. The story is jumps around, there's no flow, it's NO pageturner, and it took me forever just to force myself to finish it. I couldn't get a feel for what Nathaniel really looked like, though I'm sure he would have been sexy if I'd been able to visualize a character from the author's writing, but I could not. And the worst part was that it didn't end. No real ending. Just a ploy to get you to read the next book to see what happens next. Bad. Sorry, I don't have that much time to waste. The author had a great creative idea, but lacked the skill to bring it to life with her writing."
1,"If you like ""formulaic"" romance, this one's for you!","I was excited to read this book but my anticipation soon turned to disappointment. Instead of the historical fiction I was expecting, this novel turned out to be a predictable, formulaic romance novel with few surprises. The characters were typical as were the conflicts. Don't waste your time or money on this one!"
4,A great historical romance,"If you want to escape the modern world and go on an adventure through the American wilderness, this is the perfect book for you (it will really make you appreciate a hot shower and soap). Into the Wilderness is the first in a series of books by Sara Donati. This is the type of book where you feel like you know the characters when it's over. I felt almost as close to Nathaniel and Elizabeth as I did to Jamie and Claire from Outlander (F.Y.I. - they are mentioned in this book!).This book also taught me a lot about the relationships between the Americans and the Native Americans post-Revolutionary War, which I found to be incredibly interesting.The only thing I didn't like about the book was that there were a few slow parts. I just wanted to scream at the characters ""We don't have time for this, let's go!""All in all, if you love romantic historical fiction, you will love this book."
5,This is the beginning of a great journey into the wilderness!,"Superb writing with a storyline that will grab a hold of you and not let you loose until the last page. Historical fiction at it's finest and wonderful character development. The only reason I was not completely distraught at end is that I knew there were 6 more books!!The story starts at the next generation after Last of the Mohicans. The main male character is the son of Hawkeye and Cora, the heroine being an Englishwoman newly arrived to America. If you are fans of Penman and Gabaldon, you must not miss this story!"
5,Wonderful,Excellent! Right along the lines of Diana Gabaldon.Love love love. Can't wait to continue the series. I have just bought them all!
3,Into the Wilderness,"The author has very good descriptive writing style, in that I could visualize the characters & their surroundings in great detail.The plot seemed to take too long! This is my chief dislike! Overall great character development, and interesting adventures for the protagonist!"
5,Into the Wilderness,Venturing into this book was like venturing into the wilderness that Sara Donati masterfully created on her canvas of the written page. I found myself thinking of Elizabeth and Nathaniel during the daytime hours when I was away from the book. I didn't want this book to end. It is with great anticipation and excitement that I await the continuing saga of the Bonners.
5,Great Book,"As a fan of Diana Gabaldon, I truly enjoyed these books. They are well written and very interesting with lots of depth and action. :)"
4,Good Tuba!!!,"Well, I've never heard tuba concerto here in Mexico. And the reason may be that the tuba is not a very common instrument in this type of works. But after hearing this record, it has changed my opinion about this instrument. I thought it was just useful for marching tunes, but it seems to have a more wide use as it can be played faster, it seems that it can be a joyful (even if it looks tough) instrument. I hope that in Mexico this works would be played more often. It was indeed a good record."
1,Not a very good book on model R/C airplanes,"I do not recommend this book to anyone who is trying to learn to build or fly R/C airplanes. While the information on the basics of flying is pretty good, but all of the equipment shown is very dated, and the information on available equipment isn't very good either."
4,"The ""Inside"" of Inside Calculus","I found this book unlike any self-help text. It encourages involvement beyond reading a chapter and doing 10 softball questions. There are few graphics, but this doe not take away from the learning aspect. I also felt compelded to read on in sections I normally would have skipped and looked for easier concepts. I recommend this book to anyone who took calculus and didnt quite get it or who is now in calculus and is not quite getting it. I say it was a great math book."
1,wny did the author write this book?,"It is tedious job to read this book. I can't understand why other guy did recommand this book?Realy, this book is terrible!!!I gave 1 star because it is necessary."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK,"As a student that has taken his clas let me tell you that Exner is possibly the worst teacher ever. DO NOT waste your money on this book unless you are studying extremely high level calculus. For those of you who only deal with practical and applicable calculus, this book is not for you. Life is not about theory and proofs, it is about being able to use what you know. If you share my theory then please don't support this man by buying his book."
4,An interesting and convincing book,"After having ""the media are"" drilled into my head through four years of journalism school, I screamed when Bill Walsh said it's OK to say ""the media is."" However, I have to admit he has a point, and he states it well.Walsh says it is difficult to ""truly understand the reasons behind the rules -- and therefore know when they should be ignored."" He knows enough about grammar to be able to give legitimate reasons for ignoring some rules.This is not your grandmother's grammar. ""Web site"" vs. ""website"" and ""e-mail"" vs. ""email"" are the subjects of several rants. And Walsh casts his blessing on split infinitives and sentences beginning with conjunctions.Throughout these grammar and style lessons, Walsh's writing is interesting, fresh, convincing, intelligent and, yes, funny.This is a book for grammar-geeks and grammar-phobes alike."
2,"Moderately informative, modestly funny","Walsh makes many fine points about style in writing, particularly writing for a newspaper. But his smartypants humor wears thin very quickly. He seems to think he's really cute - wink, wink, nudge, nudge - when, to this reader, he's simply tiresome. In his subtitle he calls himself a ""curmudgeon,"" but I suspect he really is a frustrated stand-up comedian.I don't know who his audience is. Surely this book is not to be used for reference: imagine having to read the same jokes over and over. And it's also not for the 'grammar for dummies' crowd: it's generally too sophisticated for them.If I were his editor I'd suggest a rewrite."
4,Great gift,"I chose this book from a list of recommended writing sources listed on ""Daily Writing Tips"" and gave it to a friend who has a fledgling magazine titles ""Legacy Quarterly."" He was very pleased with it."
4,Useful Resource,"This book is helpful for people who write, proof, and edit. I like books that teach me something, but make it entertaining at the same time. This is written by the copy desk chief of the Business Desk at the Washington Post. I am still going through the book, but so far the most useful chapter has been the one on electronic media and terminology. Good book!"
3,Good if you want to be a journalist,I was hoping for some more along the lines of Edwin Newman but the book does have quite a few nuggets of info if you aspire to see your own prose in print some day.
2,"Not a fun read, which I assume was the intention","The title of this book made me laugh out loud, but it only went downhill from there. The witty typo and visual led me to believe that it would be a book chock full of humourous examples of poor typing and sentence construction, but I suppose the best lesson to be taken is not to judge a book by its cover. Several times his arrogance and pretentiousness caused me to put the book down for months at a time, and I doubt I'll make it through the end of the book at this rate. Consider this excerpt: ""website is gibberish-- it means the same thing as zhoxtinj."" I picture him sneering down his nose while saying things like this (and it happens often), his expression screaming ""don't you know ANYTHING?"" Some useful info, ruined by the author's snotty attitude. Not much help at all if you already know how to write a sentence in English."
4,Great Scanner,"I bought this scanner after Visioneer scanners wouldn't work with my current laptop. The Canon was a snap to hookup and work with both for color and for text. The size is wonderful - like 1/3 the space of other scanners.I did some work with a beat up picture (the Adobe software included is great, it'seasier than Photoshop with most of the features). The scanned photo on printed on glossy paper is BETTER than the original.The scan software could be more like the Visioneer software providing a one touch source to fax multiple pages. The scanner scans somewhat slowly, but this is misleading - many Mustek and Visioneer scanners I've worked with take a long time to 'warm up'. The Canon gets right to work and takes about the same overall time."
1,"Good Hardware, Lousy Software","I purchased this scanner for its small size and its reportedly acceptable scan quality. After installation, I could not scan into the included Adobe PhotoDeluxe 2.0 on my Windows 98 system, although I could scan into other applications and import the photo into PD2 if necessary. I later installed PD3.0, with disastrous results--scans into all of my image editing programs are now grossly discolored. Now entering round 2 of time consuming, annoying communications with Canon tech support. If you do not have many hours to spend on such nonsense, I do NOT recommend this scanner."
3,Why Adobe photo deluxe?,CANON CAN USE BETTER SOFTWARE LIKE COREL... HAPPY WITH IT'S COMPACT SIZE AND PERFORMANCE.
1,"Space saver, but the scans are terrible!","I liked the Canon 620P for the nice sleek, slim size. Installing the software was a breeze, no problems expect a registry problem which I corrected because Canoscan CD didn't detect a PDF program on my thinkpad.The scans for color photo was pink and blurry, newspaper article was unreadable, and combination of photo with text is pink, blurry, and unreadable.Overall rating: Strong Downgrade"
1,"Great, if your favorite color is red","OK for black & white scans, but color scans are RED all over. Even the underside of the scanner cover, which is white, scans as red. Canon doesn't have a toll-free number for tech support and doesn't respond to emails. So don't buy this one unless you really like red."
2,"I'm a huge MAD fan, but this book is disappointing!","I consider myself one of the biggest MAD fans in the world, but this book is a bit lame to the high standards of MAD. Maybe I just can't relate to all the movies because I'm not a big fan of the movie spoofs. Tha reason the book got two stars was merely because of the comics about movies in general, and a few good jokes by the likes of Dick DeBartolo and other great MAD writers."
4,Tom Clancey's Net Force: Breaking Point,"Written by Steve Perry but in keeping with the excellent story line you have come to expect from Clancey's Net Force - ""Breaking Point"" will surely impress you with it's creativity around a new weapon of mass destruction. It's so real it's spooky! Net Force Commander Alex Michael is portrayed as very human and the reader gets to see what happens next in his personal life, not to mention what happens when he tries to be a ""real"" FBI agent."
1,Woof! Woof!,"What a dog. It is difficult to become engrossed in a book where there are about 10 major characters that are all badly underwritten. The plot, regarding a mind-control ray, had some promise, but the author didn't bother to take any twists along the way to the obvious conclusion. The personal stories - troubled marriages, career issues, child raising were uncompelling. Maybe I'm a stickler, but I expect more from my airport-bought, paperback, ghostwritten, serial novels."
2,Hard To Grasp!,"Once again a Tom Clancy book has bottomed out. The book had trouble getting from A to Z. The computer insanity business had a nearly good concept but it even failed to take hold. The idea of a child throwing a boomerang has no place in an adventure book. The villains were indeed evil but they failed to come through and make this a good book. I just had trouble taking this book very seriously. The plot,the characters, failed to get this action off the ground. I wish Tom Clancy would stopusing ghost writers. They are starting to ruin his good name.Come on Tom, write one yourself next time."
4,Better than the last one.,"This was my second book by Clancy. The first one was a major flop in my opinion. This one was not to bad. It had a few flaws, but what book doesn't. At the beginning he put in a few to many characters, and I had a little trouble remembering exactly who did what. Also some of the characters were of a type that did not seem to fit with the story.Near the end, things started to get a bit confusing. Some of the happenings just didn't seem to fit the rest of the book.Also, it started out with almost everyone in a one guy and one girl situation. Farther in, it started getting into the sex stuff more than I would have liked. Not as bad as some books I have read, but still more than I liked.Even so, it was a big difference over the last one, and a very good read. I would definitely reccomend it. Read and enjoy."
1,fragmental story line,"I think that the authors tried very hard to rush out this book. Many details and sections are not connected. For example, it talks about Tyrone is good at hacking computer codes and a good friend of Jay (a computer guru), but that is it! There is no follow up in the story. My wild guess is that, Mr. Clancy and Mr. Pieczenik wrote each of their own sections and later on tried to piece them together."
1,Garbage Ending,"This is a typical Net Force novel, with developmment of the characters of Alex and Toni. They finally get together at the end, but the ending is so out of character for Toni. For conservative men over 50, it will satisfy. For everybody else, it will frustrate. I never thought I'd say it, but it's not worth your time. The neat VR internet stuff is minimal, and the lessons are ones that were already learned many times before. Don't bother."
4,My First Clancy Book,"This is the first time I have read a Tom Clancy book. I was interested because of the computer angle. I REALLY enjoyed this! Lots of characters and sub-stories, although most of the characters are not delved into very deeply. That was O.K. with me because I was looking for action, not emotions. This book has LOTS of action! The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because of the schmaltzy anti-feminist ending. Other than that, I would HIGHLY recommend it!"
4,Very good ball joint,"What can I say, it's a ball joint. Construction is solid, and it seems well made like Moog parts usually are. It comes with a new cotter pin and castle nut. However, it does not come with spare nuts for the bolts, so make sure to save your old ones. It is greasable, but a grease fitting is not included.I put this on my 2000 Toyota Corolla some time ago, and it's still going strong."
4,"Love it feature, space saving.",We just have the tank installed. We love it have instant hot water and save a lot of counterspace.A con is it does not work with my Kohler facuet that I had. I have to purhcase the insinkerator facuet which add $200+ to my budget.
2,Disappointed!!! Broke right out of warranty...Grrrrrrr,"Over $200 and it lasted--you guessed it--just over 3 years. Just died two months past warranty, leaving our hardwood floor warped and bloated with water and a huge leak we've had to deal with all day. The leak is definitey part of the construction of the insinkerator. Weak sauce people!"
3,Nice when it works,"The original Insinkerator instant hot water came with my house. It started leaking, I disassembled it and found that it was using a plastic tank. I called Insinkerator and they were awesome, they sent me a new stainless tank model. In a year it started leaking from a seal at the bottom of the tank. I coated it with two part epoxy(maybe hi-temp silastic/silcone would have been better?)anyway it lasted another year and a half.I love having it when it's working, great for tea, sterilizing objects, killing the mold in the dishwashing sponge etc. I'm torn on buying another."
3,customer service ***,"Very accommodating, they went beyond their warranty and were very helpful. I use my unit everyday and all their other products are working fine. I hope the defect was fixed and I enjoy many more years of trouble free use."
5,as expected,as expectedView tips and guidelines | 18 more words required.View tips and guidelines | 18 more words required.
2,returned,I returned this as I decided to install a real hot water heater under the sink. These small hot water heaters need to use a specific faucet for pressure relief.
5,Great Price,Works like a charm and for a great price!!! All my questions were answered quickly and efficiently prior to me purchasing.
3,Corrosion Issue,Had a H770-SS which includes a SST tank unit for 3-1/2 years when it stopped heating. Called InSinkErator but of course it was out of the warranty period. I decided to open the tank up and found a lot of sediment and that the heating coil had corroded right by where it entered the container. Seems like a flaw in the design or workmanship but not much that can be done if the company doesn't care about product defects. I have owned two unit previously but they remained behind when I moved. My last one had lasted over 10 years... So quality had degraded and you can probably just evaluate if the cost of having one of these units for 3-4 years is worth the convenience of instant hot water.
3,ISE Extended Warranty Replacement,"We have the InSinkErator SST model, 2/3 Gallon unit, manufactured 8/2007. Just noticed today that it was leaking from fittings in the return flow tank at the top of the unit. I called ISE Customer Service and (long story short) they aresending a replacement that will be backed by the original product 3-year manufacturer's warranty. The unit worked flawlessly until the leak started. Can't fault their Customer Service but having to replace a unit for what must havebeen a very inexpensive plastic part sounds an awful lot like a Ford Pinto-type problem. We'll just have to see how long the replacement unit lasts."
4,Fast Hot Water,"This product is great if you want HOT water in a hurry, easy to install, the only draw back is when the warrenty is up after three years the tank always seems to spring a leak, has happended in the past two units."
3,Instahot review,"this is a product that I truly love and would not do without. Unfortunately, this is my third unit in nine years as the first two developed leaks and consequently rotted out my cabinet floor. This time I just put a pan under it and will count on its failure in three to four years."
2,leaked within 3 years,"I bought this dispenser because I liked it's hot water capacity and the turn knob. However, the knob was difficult to turn if my hands were slippery in any way and my husband couldn't use it with his reduced hand strength. Moreover, it leaked within three years. I did not contact the company until after I replaced it and at the handyman's suggestion, I emailed them. Of course they would have nothing to do with it now that it was removed from the sink. Our handyman took it apart and ascertained that there was a design flaw - the hot water goes through a plastic piece in the bottom which melted over time. When I contacted Emerson customer service about this, they ignored me. I have written to someone higher up. We will see what she says."
1,Hose burned out and broke,"Hose burned out and broke - tech support offered no help because it's out of warrantee so I had to buy another because they wouldn't sell just the $0.10 hose. This seems like an obvious recall issue, but I haven't heard anything."
1,A Necessary Evil,"These hot water heaters are not built to last. You'll get 3-4 years before they rust and leak. I don't have much room under my sink because of the garbage disposal and since I already have a tap with plumbing compatible with this unit, getting another InSinkErator tank made sense. It does a good job for 3 years. But it would be nice to have more competitive options."
1,never buy from this copmany...ever,"I had 2 insink erators both went belly up after 2 years, being stupid i bought a replacement only to find it is incompatible with the insinkerator fawcett, but alas, I can get a new one for only $330 what a deal!I will never deal with this company again, please i hope all out there do not, it will cost you again and again!"
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!!!,"DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!! After only 2 1/2 years unit began sputtering when we tried to get hot water. Then we noticed a leak that had been slowly ruining our cabinets. And it is NOT the simple leak that a lot of reviews are mentioning, where the tube becomes brittle. Ours is leaking from the heating element.... VERY DANGEROUS AND POSSIBLE FIRE HAZARD!!I wish SOOOOOOOOOOOO much that I had read these reviews before buying this unit!!!!! Now we are going to have to buy a whole new system and have a plumber come and help us install it and change everything out properly. Because we are not about to go through this 3 or 4 times like so many of the people posting here have had to do!AND SHAME ON AMAZON FOR CONTINUING TO FEATURE THIS ITEM AFTER SO MANY OF THEIR CUSTOMERS HAVE GONE THROUGH SO MUCH TROUBLE WITH IT."
1,JUNKY PRODUCT--LEAKED and RUINED our cabinets,We have contacted this company about replacing this product and having them fix our cabinets which is now going to cost quite some money.My advice DO NOT BUY this product. It leaked one month after the warranty expired.
1,I will never buy their products anymore.,"This was my 3rd instant hot water tank. It leaks, they used plastic quick connects and they don't stand by their products. I have water dripping in through the tank and comes out the electrical wire. That can't be safe. Also, I needed a new hot water hose, I called insinkerator, they don't even supply the parts and I can't find it anywhere. Needed a high temperature tube that was also potable. I've been everywhere, Grainger only sells it by the large rolls. Also, I will never buy their garbage disposals again. I'm sick of replacing everything every few years. It's expensive and not very environment friendly. How many of their product go into the landfills. What a waste."
1,**DO NOT BUY**,"I have replaced 2 of these units in the last 4 1/2 years. Now the second one has the same leaking tank issue as the first. So in conclusion, a third replacemnt in 4 1/2 years, not a reliable product!! I do NOT recommend this product to anyone."
1,DANGER- ELECTRICITY AND LEAKING WATER DON'T MIX!,"I purchased this when I built my home in 2001 from Home Depot. In 2008, it began to leak from the holding tank area. With a call to In Sink Erator, I was assured that the re-design (stainless steel water tank) prevented any leakage. They allowed me to purchase a replacement at a large discount. That one lasted only 2 years before it began leaking. Again a call to In Sink Erator, but this time, no response from them after requesting a supervisor to call me. Three months later, they called mentioning my complaint to the Consumer Product Safety Commission. I believe this is a dangerous product that could potentially kill someone."
2,"Leaks after 2 year, too bad!","I put the unit on when I did my remodeling 2 years ago, but now it leaks, I need to replace it, but it seems hard to order one throught on line, and the price is pretty expensive, any body knows the lowest price for just order the unit itself, because it don't sounds right for paying $187.00 to purchase the complete unit with faucet(the same instant hot water tank is included), and I have to pay $199.00 just for the tank itself."
1,Check for functioning ground connection,"Phil Shikuka wrote an excellent review/advice item* describing how to finish properly assembling older samples of this heater once it's been left in your hands by Insinkerator in a condition suffering from fatal cost-reduction efforts, likely resulting in destructive water leaks.NOTE: While following Phil's instructions I discovered that --->> the safety ground on our unit had never been properly assembled<<--- meaning it gave the impression of being grounded while not actually having anything connected to the ground contact on the 120VAC cord. This is Bad. :-)All-in-all the Insinkerator SST-FLTR is a sad example of a decent basic design being ruined by overzealous cost-reduction including use of plastic in places where it's bound to fail and as well what looks dubious manufacturing quality in important places.*http://www.amazon.com/review/R31TY42NEI4X6U/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN;=B000GQTC9S&nodeID;=228013&store;=hi"
1,Second tank Failure,"Found the tank leaking water. Checked the tank warranty - 3 yrs. Unfortunately, I bought the unit 3 yrs and 2 months ago. How's that for designing a product to fail just outside the warranty period. This is our second replacement unit that failed a little after the warranty expired. Like the other reviews mention, this is a poor quality product if you want it to last more than a few years, plus you'll need to plan a pan under the tank to prevent water damage to your cabinets."
1,Junk - Do yourself a favor and avoid,Junk. The first unit lasted 14 months. Still under warrenty so I purchased another unit as a spare until first one could be repaired and it leaked out of the box. Am going with Instant hot by Kitchenmade as that unit lasted 8 years.
1,Doesn't work,"After 6 months of regular use this tank slowly lost it's ability to heat the water to it's initial piping hot temperature. Now, it's been 1.5 years and it heats the water only to lukewarm. Insinkerator will not stand behind their product."
1,Faulty device,"I ordered this replacement unit as my old tank had become corroded. This unit was faulty so I sent it back. I then picked up a new unit which also proved to be problematic, as the faucet had a new collar on it that was too large for the hole in my granite countertop. Now I'm in pursuit of a third unit...and the cost of a third trip from the plumber.I'm continuing to pursue a replacement as I love the instant hot water for tea. It's unfortunate the product quality is such an issue. The current unit is my second unit, and I had experienced the same problems with the first unit."
1,InSinkErator Tank Should be InstinkErator,"As all others have stated, there's a design flaw with this unit and yet it is still on the market. Clearly, the company doesn't care too much about its customers or it would have fixed this long ago. This unit ruined my cabinet and, of course, the company takes no responsibility for repairing it yet they have been aware of this issue for how long? Way too long. Do not buy this product. In fact, I'd stay away from anything manufactured by this company since they don't seem to care too much about their customers. As consumers, we need to direct our hard earned money to company's who actually do stand behind their products AND the damage their faulty products cause."
1,TOTAL RIP OFF,UNIT LASTED ONLY 1 YEAR - VERY DISAPPOINTED - SPENT ALOT OF MONEY FOR A FAULTY PRODUCT - NEVER WILL ORDER AGAIN
2,another leaker,"Was looking for a replacement when I see many reviews with the same problem. I have the ""stainless"" unit which leaked and ruined a cabinet. I definitely need to go another direction. This is too many failures to take a chance again."
3,Wish it lasted as well as it works!,"While quality seems to have improved since we started using these devices, they seem to last only slightly longer than the guarantee. They work well and are a great convenience, but ours have not held up very well; undetected leaks can cause a lot of damage. They can also be difficult to replace, if they were originally installed during new construction: access to the connections may be very restricted."
1,To Be Avoided Due To Quality Issues,"I bought this unit from one of the big box home improvement chains in June 2007 for a kitchen remodel. In 2009 around Feb, it leaked about a drip a second. I called up the number and they sent out a service guy. He replaced it and said that these are known to leak because of the design of the tank.Now, it's Feb 2012 and it's leaking in the same spot again. My warranty had run out but luckily the operator was nice enough to send me a replacement. Of course I'll have to replace it myself.I'm glad I caught this early so that there isn't much wood damage.I'll put in the replacement and look at finding a more reliable brand."
3,Replacement tank,My old tank lasted three years to the day. This replacement was extremely easy to install. It is however quite a bit louder while heating than the original.
2,Fails too soon; Good support,"I have three of these units, one in each sink, and have had them for several years.It's a good product, but fails far too quickly. If your's is more than two years old, put a bowl under it and watch for leaks periodically. Otherwise you will eventually find everything in the area soaked when the tank fails.Two of these bought only a few years ago have now both failed. Calling the support phone number, the company volunteered to send me a replacement tank even though out of warranty (based on s/n manufacturing date). That's nice customer support. Just wish the unit would last longer.Other reviews mention product improvements; I hope these result in longer service life for this otherwise nice product."
2,Works reasonably well though I didn't find it to be very hot and it breaks after about 2-2.5 years,"I'm on my third. It works well but be prepared to replace it after a couple of years. It's pricey and is sold on the basis of durability, so that is a surprising to me. My advice is to buy it with a credit card that extends the one-year warranty to two, so you'll at least be covered if it dies un under two years. I should add that we have a Keurig for coffee so we haven't really been using this all that much."
3,Replaced Existing Tank,"I love my Insinkerator, however disappointed at lifespan of initial product -- just 5 years. Replacing tank unit was very easy and I thank Insinkerator for thinking about this ahead of time. No plumbing skills or tools required. Just unplugged old unit and unhook the water supply to the unit and replace with new unit."
3,So far so good,This unit for me was very easy to set up and install. So far it has met our needs. We will see if it will exceed them in the near future.
4,Hot and Cold Water Storage tank (Undercounter) and Water Filter,It is of good quality and it is easy to adjust the temperatures. It stores a good capacity of hot and cold water.Drinking quality is good.
1,Three Year InSinkErator Water Heater,"We had one of these in a new home purchased in 2007. Sometime in the last few months it started leaking and was un-noticed until this week when we found the cabinet floor suffering from water damage and mold. So, I spent most of yesterday cleaning up and repairing and removing the unit. It worked fine for three years, but if you put one in, put a bucket under it since leakage seems to be a common problem. I didn't contact the manufacturer because I wouldn't put another one if if they gave it to me and paid for the installation. I bought a soap/lotion dispenser for the counter top hole previously occupied by the InSinkErator."
1,One BIG POS,"Take my word on this. These Instant Hots are a POS!!!!!!!!! They constantly leak, a rubber hose insides cracks then leaks. The fittings are horrible. The element burns out. Buyer BEWARE!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I warned you!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Unbelievable piece of CRAP,"This is our second attempt with In-Sink-Erator. The first was a plastic model with an enormous designflaw. This SST-FLTR corrodes and leaks at the electical connect sites on the front bottom of the device. They were cited in 2002 by U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission and I would urge everyone (forget the warranty) and think safety- water + electricity = major hazard. To report a dangerous product or a product-related injury, call CPSC's hotline at (800) 638-2772. Consumers can obtain this release and recall information at CPSC's Web site at www.cpsc.gov.Be honest BUT please do not ignore this companies apparent cavalier and dangerous design flaws."
1,Don't Buy It! Very Poor Quality. Product will fail after a few years.,"It is very convenient, but not worth the trouble and cost.I am on my second set of Insinkerator hot water dispenser & hot water heater in less than nine years. The levers on the faucet failed on both units and both heating unit tanks leaked. If you consider the water damage from the leaking water tank unit, replacement and plumber's installation costs you will incur when buying this product. We have spent over $1,400 on installation, replacement and repair of this product. It's not worth it. Also, the replacement water filters cost about $70 each (with tax and shipping)!"
1,Avoid this unit!,"I have installed THREE of these units in the past five years, ALL have failed. Leaky tanks, broken plastic parts, etc. these units are just not reliable. Having access to hot water is great, but you will need to replace this unit sooner than later. The company's replacement policy is also a pain in the butt. Customer service is not helpful, and not familiar with their product. VERY disappointed. Bought another unit to replace the SST. We'll see."
3,convenient but not reliable,"This is the third tank we've had in 5 years. When they are working, it is great to have instant hot water. Problem is that every 2 or 3 years something goes wrong. The first one leaked from the tank but was replaced by the company. The second one caused the water to constantly drip from the faucet even though the temperature was not set too high, and we had to replace it on our own. We will keep replacing them though since we love the instant hot water and can't find any other options."
1,DO NOT PURCHASE OR USE,"Beware: in my opinion, the plastic Insinkerator filter (F201R)is prone to rupturing. Ours did during the night and flooded the entire first floor. Thousands of dollars to remove the water, dry everything out, and then repair. The plumber who came to replace said that these Insinkerator plastic filters are prone to this, so he does not install them at all any more. Buyer beware."
1,Save your money,"After purchasing 2 InSinkErator ""Standard"" models that failed between 3-4 years, I thought that the Stainless Steel model would be an improvement. Wrong.This EXPENSIVE SST model lasted 3 years and 6 months. While the stainless tank didn't rust, the heating element pressed into the side of the tank did. InSinkErator used to have a good name for excellent products. Now they build junk.Read the above review about denial of warranty because a plumber didn't install a unit. Not only do they build JUNK, but they are THUGS with hidden terms and conditions for warranty. How hard is it to push three hoses on to the top and plug the unit in? I really don't need a $120 plumber to do it.Now I'm committed because I have a high-dollar hot and cold dispenser, else I would never buy another thing from this company. This unit was likely DESIGNED TO FAIL after 3 years. Mark their products as POS."
3,the 3 year upgrade,"i purchased this as a replacement after 3 years of good use of the original tank. The tank works well and is easy to install but has a design flaw in the plastic material used for the vent internal to the unit. (As an engineer, I had to tear it apart to understand why it failed.) Over time the vent tube will degrade. Based on other reviews, some folks experience leaking. In my case, the smell of ashes permeated the space under the sink where the tank was installed and I knew it wasn't safe to keep using the tank.Of course, the tank had a 2 year warranty so I ended up purchasing another unit. If you expect this product to be a consumable with a ~3 year lifetime, you should be happy. If you think that expensive tanks should last as least as long as a good house hot water heater then you will be disappointed."
4,Works well but quirky,"I returned the first one because a piece was rattling inside. The second one showed up with the same problem so I guess that is normal - it would be good if the documentation mentioned that is to be expected! Would have saved me the hassle of returning. Other than that we are happy with it, it works much better than the last tank and has higher capacity and is easy to set the temperature on the dial. Once in a while you can hear it rumbling as it heats the water, but its not very often and its barely audible from under the counter."
1,Customer Service Terrible,"Insinkerator just refused to help me with a leaking hot water dispenser that I've had between 3 and 4 years. I emailed Insinkerator, and when they would not help, I asked to have my request elevated to the next level. Someone then called me, but he still refused to help. Unfortunately I do not have my purchase receipt, and Insinkerator as much as said I am lying about how long I've had the unit. From other comments on here, it appears they are tightening up their policy of replacing leaking units. Some get a price break on new units, some get nothing, but I don't see many free replacements anymore. I won't buy another Insinkerator product."
1,Load of rubbish - Insinkerator Water Heater,Be very careful - ours lasted less than two years when it started leaking! Dealer wanted 300 (English Pounds) for replacement. I took it to an electrical engineer who opened it up. Told me it was a load of rubbish! Interior plastic pipes had perished from the heat. It had leaked from the cracks and destroyed the control board. Tank was full of black sludge despite the water supply going through a filter.Quality is rubbish . He said best place for it was the rubbish bin and he advised don't replace it as it will go again. Seems its a common story! How a company like Insinkerator can sell such a cheap product is mind boggling.
4,Works,"Our old one gave out after 8 years. This is an improved model, and has a dial that allows you to set the temperature level. It was pretty easy to set up. The filter was a problem for me. Not all parts needed are provided for the filter, I had to go to Lowes to search for parts and still had trouble with it. Seems it is thrown in as an extra that one can use or not. If I bought this again, I would skip the filter. It was too much trouble, lacked certain parts, and directions were unclear."
2,You probably won't get 5 years out of it.,"I have had my SST-FLTR for just under 4 years. Started to leak like other reviewers and I disassembled it. Found that the seal between the drain plug and the stainless steel housing was leaking as well as the leaking water apparently corroded the so-called stainless steel vessel to the point where the vessel has been penetrated and there are leaks coming through.Based on the other reviewers, I am guessing that nobody gets more than 4-5 years of service from this thing. That's $50 per year (not including the $60 filters, they recommend replacing twice a year) for a couple of cups of hot water per day...."
3,InSinkerator SST-FLTR InstaHot Unit,"My unit started to leak after about 2.5 years in service. With a three year warranty, we were still in warranty. Contacted the manufacturer and after a few basic questions, agreed to replace the unit. Offerred to send someone out or we could install ourselve and would receive a gift card for our trouble. Told them to ship the unit and the gift card. They must have seen plenty of this as they seemed not to doubt it. Good service on the warranty replacement - bad design on the unit."
4,Stands by their product,"I purchased my Insinkerator, model # SST-FLTR with model GN1100 faucet, 5 yrs and 2 months ago so it was no longer under any warranty. The warranty on the tank was for only 3 yrs. My unit just started leaking and burned out the electrical components. For 5 yrs the unit worked just fine with no problems at all. I called Insinkerator to ask them what they could do for me. They are sending me a completely new unit-no questions asked-free of charge. Frankly I was surprised as they didn't really have to do this. I've read all of the negative reviews regarding their product and their customer service or lack there of but that was definitely not the case for me. I have discovered that when you are nice and don't exhibit an attitude it really goes a long ways. Stuff breaks and most good companies stand behind their products. I would definitely recommend this company and this product based on my experience with them."
2,Plugs up quickly,"Even with the filter installed upstream of the heater, this unit plugs up quickly with hard water deposits. For the cost, you're better off just putting a cup of water in the microwave to heat it up. A waste of space under the sink and a waste of money overall."
2,Insinkerator SST,"Just like many of the other reviews, our Insinkerator leaked all of the water out at about the three year point. Thank goodness that we smelled a terrible burning smell that caused us to look under the sink. The wood damage from leaking water is always an issue. I called the company and they said that the life of this unit is about 4 years."
2,Good but doesn't last long,The heater works well except it only lasted 3 1/2 years before it burnt out. Luckily it was pretty inexpensive and easy to replace. My other complaint is the cheap tubing that goes from the heater to the dispenser. It is definitely not the appropriate tubing.
2,Just doesn't last,"I concur with others who find that the unit has a short life. After four years of use, it the tank began leaking...which marks the end of its little life. Yet, the convenience of instant hot water is likely to push me to buy another. Addicted."
4,Instant Water Heater,"After almost 2 months use, it is holding up well. It appears to be better than the old heater I had. I gave it only a 4 stars because it is quite noisy. I expect the beefy insulation would contain both heat and noise."
2,"Great concept, poor product","We agree with the many negative reviews of this particular product. After three years our unit sprang a leak and water dripped down to the unit below ours damaging a kitchen light fixture. As has been noted elsewhere, when we opened the unit we found that the piece of plastic tubing running out of the tank was blackened and brittle. My wife, who is very health conscious, who won't even drink cold water from a non BPA free plastic bottle, was horrified. We will try the silicon tubing fix that was mentioned in another review.In any case, even despite the criminally poor design, we would buy another unit because we're hooked on the convenience of instant hot water. In the future we'll keep a bucket under the heater and check periodically for leaks."
4,Hot water on demand,"This is a great addition to kitchen sink. I have wholehouse tankless hotwater system with recirc. but this provides upto boiling hotwater instantly, its a nice extra to have. Quality built and easy to install. I opted to forgo the instructions plumbing guide to use a shutoff valve and used a sharkbite reducing Tee 1/2x1/2x3/8. If you want nice extra for your kitchen I recommend this."
4,pretty good poduct,"I heard so much bad stuff about this product that I was afraid to buy it. I thought the tea kettle would suffice. I missed my instant hot water so much that I went ahead and ordered it. My boyfriend installed it. It gave him some difficulty, but not an awful lot. So far it has been great. I did read that they don't last long and will eventually leak like the metal one did, which is why I bought this tank in the 1st place. I love my instant hot water. It was worth the investment."
2,Tank Leaked after 4 years,"My first purchase of this type of product. The tank leaked after four years. I took it apart and it was leaking from the plastic seal/drain plug at the bottom of the unit. Called the 800 number, have to replace the whole tank as you can't just replace the plug. It was out of warrantee but they are sending me a replacement tank - no cost. I'm impressed for replacing the tank at no cost but poor engineering of product in the first place. If it fails again, I'll remove it and fill the whole in the sink with a soap dispenser."
3,SST tank leaked - free replacement,"I have purchased three of these ISE hot water dispensers for my kitchen over a 20 year period. It is very handy to have the hot water! The first lasted more than 10 years, and the next two 10 years combined. The third one was the SST (stainless steel tank) model from 2006 which here in May of 2012 leaked rusty water from the drain plug - and had the blackened plastic hose problem that other reviewers have talked about (the hose didn't crack, but was very brittle). I explained the leaking-tank issue to InSinkErator customer support and they volunteered to send a new tank - didn't have to ask. The replacement tank will have a 90 day warranty unlike the original 3 year warranty, so I guess that is a hint that this is my last free tank. If it lasts another six years, I guess I won't mind so much buying yet another replacement. However, I will look around to see if someone has invented out a better, longer-lasting design."
3,Works great but for how long?,"This is not the first of this product I've used. This 'instant hot' works great but in 15 years it's at least the 4th one I've had. The company began making it with the stainless steel tank so I thought it would do better, but the thing began to leak within 4 years anyway. If I had a well made alternative I would get it."
1,poor quality,"i went through two of these. the second was a replacement under warranty, but now the warranty has expired. both of them ended up leaking via the screw at the bottom of the unit. the first unit started giving this odd smell shortly before it leaked.look through the reviews, there is a consistent thread of poor quality. for something his high end, we should all expect better."
4,Insinkerator,"This is a direct replacement for the one I bought and installed 3 years ago. It didn't last like I thought it would. Like many others the older unit failed causing it to leak. The rubber hose inside deteriorated and dried up. This unit came with a water filter system which with a few fitting changes connected up easily. I only use the system for hot water, so why not filter the water before it goes in the unit, maybe prolonging the life. This unit when heating up is much quieter than the previous and all connections were simple with no new fittings needed. We will see how long this one lasts. They seem to have about a 3-4 year lifespan. If the quality of the material holds up I will be happy and when the product works it is a very great system to have. We use it mostly to jump start the boiling water process."
3,InSinkErator,"I wasn't aware that it had a filter system so it was a big deal to install it since I had the old fittings. The insta hot is in, but the filtering system is not. I was told it would fit the old fittings. Not so."
4,Much better quality that the waste king version,"Waste King version was smaller (good thing) but easier to break. Make sure it is protected from jamming stuff under the sink, if the plastic fitting breaks, it's done. The insinkerator one seems to be more robust."
1,Can not give it 0 stars: Too bad,"In the 3 years I've had it, it has been replaced 11 times (all free from insinkerator), good customer service but i really want a good product too. 8 of the 11 times i had dark rusty water come out of it and 3 of them the heating element stopped worked. It's out of warentee and the heating element stopped working today. Time to find a new brand"
2,Worked great--until it started leaking,"Product worked great for a little over a year, until the warranty ran out. Now, after 15 months it has sprung a leak. The warranty is supposed to be 5 years on the ""bronze tank""--time will tell whether InSinkErator stands behind the product. I hope that they do, and that they improve the issues that others have reported.However, between my own experience and that of many other people on the site, I cannot recommend this point-of-use kitchen water heater at all, due to the leak we're now experiencing.I DO however recommend these things in theory, as having the instant hot water for making coffee, tea or cleaning has been awesome. I want to get this thing fixed or replaced--I love having the feature. Just not the boiling water spilling out underneath my sink."
2,Have had it with Insinkerator brand dispensers,"This is my second Insinkerator brand hot water dispenser in the past 5 years. The first one had the plastic tank which cracked after 2.5 years. The ""newer"" stainless tank version just failed too with hot water pouring out. Have not had a chance to take it apart to see exactly what failed this time.Luckily, I was home both times otherwise the water damage could've been considerable."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS!!!!,Here's the problem--its a design flaw:A plastic resevoir is placed directly on topof the heating unit with no insulation between them.The result is a melted resevoir which leaks watereventually. I imagine 100% of these will fail...My plumber called them afteropening up the leaking unit and was told thiswould void the warranty! A moot point anyway.The unit was 3 months past warranty expiration.What a terrible waste of money/plumber's fees& crummy customer service too.I'm disgusted with this company.
1,Insinkerator DOES NOT STAND BY THESE,"I also had a leaking tank a few years after installation. I called InSinkErator and they told me that my choice was to fix it at my own cost or replace it at my own cost. They were polite but that's it. I asked the service person, ""Why would I EVER buy another InSinkErator??""She was pretty obviously reading from a script. She really didn't know what to say. So that was that. I wouldn't buy from them again."
1,Poor Design - Insinkerator should know better,"Two years old and leaking under my sink. What a piece of crap. Luckly the model (SST-FLTR) was still under waranty (3 years - also a joke)and Insinkerator is going to send another tank in 5-7 business days, but why is their product failing after two years? There wasn't one question or comment from their service person, probably because they get this compliant a lot. From an earlier post, it looks like they made have replaced the weakest link with a part that might last 3 years, i.e. the waranty period. After that, you are on your own. And don't get me started on the requirements Insinkerator places on the homeowner before they will replace their deffective device. Would I buy this product again? NO!"
1,Two leaking tanks in less than 3 years,"I have the the SST model. In less than 3 years, I have gone through 2 leaking tanks - both left a puddle of water on the bottom of my cabinet. I am waiting for my replacement tank (which the company will send under warranty). But, since my warranty is running out after this, it will be the last InSinkErator unit I use. Once this one breaks (I fully expect it to), I will be looking for a new replacement unit and I know it will NOT be an InSinkErator unit. For those people who are thinking about purchasing this product, STAY AWAY from it!"
2,loved it while it lasted,Loved it while it lasted. But it lasted only about 2 years then it died. I'll wait on posting more until I see what kind of warranty work they provide. The thing split and started leaking.
2,Lasted 3.5 years. Try another brand. (Waste King),"I installed this heater in 2007. Shortly after 3 years of operation, the unit began tripping the ground-fault plug erratically. Suspecting a faulty plug I replaced it with a new one. Same problem. Eventually the plastic heating element cover melted down and began to smoke.I took the unit apart and found that all of the heating element connections were plastic and melted. No way to repair the unit with a new heating element either. I was forced to throw it away and buy a new one.Because of others reviews I purchased the Waste King unit and I am very impressed so far. All metal cover and heavier than the Insinkerator. The faucet is also of higher quality than the Insinkerator. For $75 less, there is no reason not to buy the Waste King unit, even if it last 3 years (although reviews have indicated more reliable operation out of the Waste King units.)"
1,"Failed after 2 years, repaired, then leaked after 4 years","Although this model is an improvement over Insinkerator's previous generation (w/o the stainless steel tank), it stopped heating water after two years. After getting it repaired (under warranty), it worked for 2 more years and then began leaking, which damaged a new hardwood floor I had recently installed.Note that the warranty is 5 years for the product itself, but the stainless steel tank has only a 3 year warranty.For $250 (which is what I paid for it 4 years ago), I expected better. I would not buy another Insinkerator hot water dispenser again. If you decide to buy one, don't expect it to last more than 3-4 years (if you're lucky)."
2,SSTFLTR,"Bought unit in August '06. Installed following directions, worked great till March 2010 (6 months after warranty expired) when the heater jacket split, flooding kitchen cabs etc."
5,SO GOOD I BOUGHT IT TWICE!,"I bought both of Don Parker's books: ""You're Under Arrest I'm Not Kidding"" and ""Officer Needs Assistance...Again."" Both are jam packed with funny, incredibly well written stories about a cop on the beat. These stories are for anyone who likes to laugh. I am not a cop, and I've never been arrested. But while reading these books, I found myself riding with Deputy Don and laughing both WITH him and AT him. I loaned both books to a friend as MUST READ material. When he moved away without returning either book, I bought them all over again because I didn't want to be without these books in my library. Get both these books. If anyone ever asks you if you've got any good books to read, loan them these... but make sure you get them back. Otherwise, you'll miss them so much you'll have to buy them twice!"
4,Decent,"This book provides good, basic comments for Romans and would be ideal for a Sunday School or high school class. Personally, I wish it were written for a higher age range and were a little deeper, but it does have helpful information."
2,Not entirely Satisfied,"I bought this book for my kindle, and found out that it did not have page numbers. I know that Kindle just recently introduced page numbers to their books, but I was highly irritated that there was no warning that told me there would be no page numbers. Otherwise it's a great book, but don't buy for kindle if you plan on reading it for an assignment where the page numbers are just assigned."
5,Great Overview Book,This is an Excellent book about the book of Romans. It is easy reading and very understandable!
4,New twist on an old philosophy,"What I like about this book is the author's willingness to creatively apply the age-old wisdom of the I Ching to modern times. It lends a new twist, and an almost jolly interpretation to the hexagrams that is lacking in many other renditions. I've been using the I Ching for decades, and the standard reference - for me - has 'always' been the Wilhelm-Baynes translation (which I highly recommend, especially if you are unfamiliar with the I Ching). I don't think this book was ever intended to be a replacement for that venerable work, or even a departure from it. It is a light, humorous, entertaining and downright fun-to-read treatment of an old, deeply inspired wisdom. Just keep a copy of the Wilhelm-Baynes translation next to it; it will help you appreciate the gleeful, creative spirit of this book. Worth the price just for the entertainment alone."
1,Want to learn about the I Ching? Then don't buy this book.,"This book is of no use at all if you want to get acquainted with the Chinese Book of Changes. Although Kaser uses the trigrams of the I Ching, he gives fancy names to the hexagrams which are alien to the I Ching; he gives a very narrow interpretation of the original Chinese text without naming the original at all. It's like writing a book with guys named Abraham and Jesus, and call it the Bible.There are far better books to start with."
4,complex - but it works,"Based on John Fowles' novel, the screenplay is even more complex. The forbidden love between a tainted woman & a city gentleman who is engaged to someone else, is juxtaposed with an ongoing affair between the actor & actress playing the parts! It works, once the viewer realizes what is going on. The director also keeps one guessing how the two parallel love affairs are going to turn out. Why did Meryl Streep not get the Oscar for this role? Excellent performances, as expected, from Streep & Irons."
2,The area code of dvd was not correct one,I ordered this item with region code 2 (Europe) but got the one with region code 1 (US). I simply can not play it.
3,So-so,Not bad but also not great. Strong female lead who followed her heart - and loins - to go with the man she loved.
2,"Contrived, pretentious and boring","I heard about this movie for so long I really expected to like it. Alas, the story is contrived and pretentious, yet boring. It moves really slowly, making me check my watch several times.The biggest disappointment of all is Streep's performance, I am really surprised how much I dislike it. Maybe Hepburn was right. Her performance is all on the surface, no depth. I did not believe for a second she was a tortured woman from 100 years ago, all I saw was Streep the actress putting on air. And the ending is so contrived it cheapens the whole thing. The only redeeming quality of the movie is the cinematography and the set design."
4,Something more than just corn on the cob,"The story within a story as literary device is hardly new, but suits Fowles' approach to his fiction (never having been shy to attempt alternative narrative structures himself). It being unlikley that film could do justice to TFLW's complexity and intellectual atmosphere, by creating something fresh, Pinter has avoided attempting the impossible - competing head on with one of the most intriguing novels of the 20th century. Besides the parallel plot strands offer the opportunity for many additional insights and commentaries that a straight retelling could not."
5,A wonderful experience,"Beautifully crafted, shot and directed, this is a superb little picture, starring an excellent Meryl Streep and unfogettable perfomance by Jeremy Irons. It is a movie I would watch over and over again. Thoughtful, intelligient drama. Highly recommended."
5,My All-Time Favorite Female Vocalist,"My all-time favorite female singer! I rank her higher than Carly Simon and Janis Ian, which is saying a LOT. Kind of a female Stephen Bishop, music-wise.Superb 70s West Coast pop, she charms you in with her smooth voice and crystal-clear arrangements. Strong material. Mellow and sophisticated.Also, find her singing with the Coyote Sisters. They put out an LP in the 80s worth finding and a newer CD, ""Women and Other Visions"". I recommend them all. The 80s one has a more commercial sound, but it features such strong harmonies and a full sound, it's like ""night cruising music."" The newer CD is softer and more personal.And don't forget her biggest radio duet, ""If I Could Only Touch Your Life"" with Arlo Guthrie on his ""Power of Love"" CD, available on iTunes."
4,Great Variety,"I found the patterns in this book fantastic. Being ""Down Under"" it is very hard to find knitting patterns in larger sizes. This book gave me a really good selection of patterns from lounging around the house jumpers to some really nice evening tops (if you use the right yarn). Also a good selection of singlets for summer. A great variety and really easy and clear instructions. Pictures of all the patterns taken in a way so you can actually see the finished product."
4,Classic Knits for Real Women,"I loved the designs and the variety. Among the Jackets, sweaters, cardigans, tops and scarves, I saw a granny square purse that I fell in love with. I did not like the loop-stitch set. The pictures are clear and the charts are next to the pattern. At the back of the book there are knitting techniques, abbreviations and yarn information including mail/web addresses. Very useful book."
2,Misleading Title,Classic Knits for Real Women: Versatile Knitwear Designs For Plus SizesI was very disappointed with this book. In the title it says that the patterns therein are for Plus Sizes. I do not consider a size 46 adequate for most Plus Sized Women.
5,Please read this review,"Some of the other reviewers here obviously don't know much about knitting. The size listing of 46 is garment size, not finished measurment. All you have to do is look at the schematics for the finished measurments which show 50+ inches for the patterns. Several of the styles are really very nice and yes some of us do have $200 dollars to spend on nice yarn and don't buy at the hobby stores. These authors design for Rowan International and Rowan has an excellent pattern line, especially if you seek out some of the vintage ones.Give this book a chance especially if you don't have the expertise to adjust your patterns yourself."
1,Size 12 is Plus Size? Not in my Universe.,"From the title, I thought this would be a great book - classic sweaters designed for larger women. Um, not as such.The vast majority of the models for the book? Apparently sizes 8-12. There's one, count it, *one* model who looks like she might wear a plus size.I wasn't overly impressed with the garments themselves, but that pales beside the fact that I can't trust them to be sized correctly for plus sizes because their models are not plus-sized."
2,Dumpy patterns,I am so disappointed. I was hoping for sleek and stylish patterns for size 12 and higher. So many of the patterns in this book have oversized fringe and bobbles. Yuck! Real women and plus size women are not necessarily frumpy grannies.
2,not for big women knitting,I thought this book was for large size women. To help in increasing the size of the different patterns a person would want to knit. It was not.I was very surprise. Not a good book. For me it wasn't worth buying.
2,Nice idea that didn't go far enough,"I was also disappointed in this book -- nice idea, but the sizing and shaping didn't go far enough to meet my needs and those of many of my fellow knitters. I love Rowan yarns, but frequently their designs (including those in this book) are not upsized and updated for fuller-figured gals like myself. If you're a US size 22 or so, this book may work for you. If, like me, you're more plush than a 22, get out your calculator and a sketch pad to retool these patterns for your needs."
3,On the Surface,"This book seemed to skim the surface of things. As I read, I was never confident that I was getting information on fifty ""basic"" writers of Hawaii. Nor was I sure what ""basic"" meant in this case. As I read, I felt that I was on the receiving end of an exercise: ""Quick, write a short book about 50 basic authors of/about Hawaii."" I wish this book had more depth, or more information."
3,Standard Fare,Decent but my friend recently told me about blank exhibit tabs...so that you dont get stuck with 100 Z tabs after a while. The price listed on Amazon (about 5) is standard.
5,When's his next novel due out!!!!!?????,"A gripping page-turner. Couldn't put it down for a minute. I read this book in early 1996, and I've anxiously been awaiting the arrival of his next novel every since. Mr. Folsom ... hurry it up please"
4,Excellent first novel,I recently read the novel afetr it was recommended to me by the clerk at Walden's. The novel was exciting and well worth the sleepless nights up reading it. The ending was a little preditable and he could have explained a few things better but I guess that comes from being a screenwriter. I cant wait to get his next novel for I am always searching for new material to read
5,Among the best thrillers ever written,"I am a fan of the thriller genre, and picked this up on a whim. I have never been more satisfied with one of my purchases in my life. I was unable to put this book down from the time I started it. This book has it all good writing, great characters, murder, romance, and some very immoral villians.The plot line of the story is about the nazi party's attempt to rebuild itself. One of their most important tasks is to build themselves the perfect leader. These people will stop at nothing to accomplish this task no matter how many people die in the process. To say more about the plot would destroy it.All I can say is buy this book. Even if you do not consider yourself a thriller fan this book will captivate you."
3,"Good read, but predictable","Even though the plot is predictable, you still want to keep going to see how he gets you there. A very good read for those who like thrillers."
4,Lots of twists and turns,"Great reading which made for some late nights! The ending was not what I expected, which is a good thing."
2,Got Bored Eventually,"This book started out as very entertaining but around the middle started to drag for me. By pg. 300 I decided all the new characters and twists and weird circumstances were becoming boring so I flipped through the next few hundred pages and was done. As other commented, it was much too long for the story and the characters, save McVey, just did not come to life."
4,"Tension, intrigue, twists... They're all there","I was living in Germany this summer and dying to read ANYTHING written in English. A FREE copy of this book fell in my lap... So, in my desparation, I read it. Well, it was great! Lots of unexpected twists and turns. (Some not so unexpected, too.) Good airplane, commute or rainy day weekend reading"
4,A good book,"The plots are complicated and the author is able to connect them, well.I came across this book by chance but after I read the first few pages, there was no turning back, or puttingdown. In fact, my wife and I 'fought' for the book.The story is exciting, full of actions and mysteries. It makes the readers wanting to know the ending and it doesit well, and everything is only revealed at the end, right down to the last 2 words.Well, I don't want to give the story away but I have one question. How could Von Holden carry something so importantto the organisation in a box that could fall open when dropped on the floor?"
4,"Wonderful entertainment, great page-turner, solid value","Loved it, felt sorry when it was over. Right up there withStephen King, Robert Parker, or John Grisham for sheer page-turning readability.Completely devoid of any redeeming value, just pure mind-Twinkies. Like Ian Fleming, Folsom projects an air of complete conviction in the ridiculous details of his adolescent fantasy world. Plenty of hidden doors, secret tunnels, and concealed video cameras. My favorite character is the bad guy who has deliberately had his legs amputated so he can disguise himself by altering his height after shooting somebody (snap off the long prostheses, snap on the short ones. I enjoyed the fact that _I_ was able to guess the ending _long_ before the hero does. Hint: it's not Elvis Presley that the ex-Nazis are trying to revive. (But I how could Von Holden carry a box ""26 inches high by two feet square"" in a rucksack?)"
5,Slow start - but then its a roller coaster!,"I almost put this book down because it was going anywhere after the first 50 pages, but things picked up and for the next 675 pages it was one wild plot twist after another. It truly is a fun book to read, but I must warn you - don't get too attached to any of the characters because the author treats any and all of them as expendable.It involves a man who sees his father's killer at a Paris cafe and his pursuit of the man brings him ito contact with an Interpol investigation of an entirely set of unrelated crimes (or so it seems...)Good pacing, after the first 50 pages. The end was a bit disappointing, but just about any ending would have been after all of this adventure."
3,"Started fast, but ended slowly...","I've read many of the reviews below, and I must admit that I agree with both the people who loved The Day After Tomorrow and the people who were bored.This book started with a bang. The first 25% was incredibly riveting. But then it began to slow down, and (like others have said) became hard to believe.It's like the book Cold Fire (by Dean Koontz). That book was just as exciting at the beginning. But then became too fantastic and went on too long."
3,"Thrills at times, but overlong","Allan Folsom's THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW jump-starts on the first page when Paul Osborn, in a Paris cafe, sees across the room the man who killed his father and gives chase. Over the next 725 (!) pages he continues that chase, which pulls him into the midst of an international conspiracy peopled by various criminals and comrades from France, the U.S., Germany, and Switzerland.An entertaining read. Folsom has a nice way of interrupting the mundane with matter-of-fact horror. Still, there are long sections that could easily have been cut -- this should have been a 400-page book. Some of the plot twists are ludicrous, the good luck of some of the characters entirely unbelievable, but enjoy the book nonetheless. One other note -- the book is marred by numerous typos that should have been corrected in the paperback edition. A good beach read, or save it for a long, long train ride."
1,proof that anyone can write a best-seller,"God - where to begin? How in the world did this thing get published?!!? The prose is puerile, the plot preposterous (and predictable), and the characters cardboard. I can't recall ever having seen so much hype so terribly misdirected. Aside from being lousy fiction, he got his physics and biology all wrong, too. You've all heard the proposition about one million monkeys with one million type writers producing 'Hamlet' if given enough time? This thing wouldn't take a brain-damaged baboon more than 15 minutes with a dull pencil!I've heard a rumor that Mr. Folsom was paid a record amount for this crap. I'd say he should use the money to replace all the trees that were killed to print this on"
1,The Day after Tomorrow - Kindle edition FAILS,"I am disappointed. I''m not sure to whom my anger should be directed, the publisher or Kindle. I have struggled through what appears to be a wonderful story. I would rate the book very high but would not recommend the Kindle version. The misspellings, inappropriate punctuation, and various letters just inserted between words, has made reading the Kindle version of this book miserable. I really enjoy the plot and the characters, but I would advise readers to go to the library and take out a hard copy or purchase the book in paperback. The Kindle version is inexcusable! I assume Kindle (or the publisher) has not hired any proofreaders. The book was thrown into Kindle format with so many errors, it detracts from the pleasure of reading. Whether the fault lies with Kindle or the publisher, for the sake of your readers, HIRE A PROOFREADER!"
2,Promising but falls flat,"It is a strange book. The general themes are good - Nazis trying to take over the world and Californian doctor taking them on single handedly. The trouble is that there are far too many conincidences, starting when Dr. Osborn bumps into his fathers killer having been in France for only a few days. Anyway, I read that much on the back cover so my fault for buying it.You get the impression that this was written with one eye on film deal. Great locations, good looking cast, castles bursting into flames. However, for all the drama, there was nothing that really gripped the reader. The last few pages were fine, once we go a full explanation as to what had been going on for the previous 700 pages, but the explanation came too late.It's not all bad, just frustrating. A Bourne Identity without the suspense."
1,A terrible book,"I picked up The Day After Tomorrow at the airport and wastrapped with it on a three-hour flight. What a terrible,preposterously-written book. The plot is not only laughable, it's also predictable. (I think I'll go rent Die Hard so I can see how this stuff's supposed to be done.)"
1,shockingly bad...,"geez, it seems I read a different book than the masses who posted here with 5 stars. This book is one of those that make you laugh out loud...not at the inherent humor...but of the improbable scenario's, incredibly bad writing, and characters that are laughable. My favorite...the 22 year old female with an incredible body ""and a brain to match"" oh yeah...trained as an exposives expert in east germany...did I mention she was beautiful? Don't believe the hype here just read something else."
4,"Good story, but the author should have done some research...","...on the german comments he threw in from time to time. Most of the time they are just out of date (nobody talks like that in Germany) and sometimes they are completely wrong grammatically. But otherwise I thought it was a pretty exciting book to read. But hey, just that you all know: Germans are not all still waiting for Hitlers return! The book might give you the impression :-)"
2,Good start but ultimately disappointing,"This book starts out fast with a good pace and an interesting scenario. For about the first half of the book I was hooked. But after awhile it balloons into a ridiculous ""secret"" conspiracy plot which seems to involve about half of the european population. By the second half, the main characters are reduced to little more than narrowly escaping one disaster after another. Having said this, I'll add that if you like books to read like a typical adventure movie, you probably will like this book a lot more than I did."
3,Fast paced but open ended,"Although this book is a fast read and keeps you hooked it leaves too many explanations open. Some of the connections and assumptions made are too far fetched. And you can guess the end too easy. I don't want to give too much away but I really would like to know how some of the things got accomplished. On another note, Allan Folsom and his editor should have gotten a better translation for some of the German expressions."
1,"A terrible, awful, horrible book","This is a terrible, terrible book, by far the worst I have ever read and I have read some real dross in my time. I kept reading until almost the very end as I couldn't believe that it wouldn't get any better, but it doesn't. It gets worse.This book taught me two very valuable lessons: You don't have to finish every book you start. You can also throw them out."
1,You might want to give it a try if...,"Okay, here's the scene. You're an American, born and raised in the Twentieth Century. You're functionally literate. You watch the news on TV every day. You're aware that, before you were born, there was a very big war called World War Two. In this war, some bad guys called Nazis took over Europe (which is a far away place where the people are white, but talk funny). But then the Americans won the war and everything was better.Now you, an American, have seen a lot of movies and probably even watched the History Channel. You've heard that there is a form of entertainment called a ""book"", which consists of a whole lot of pages with nothing but words on them. No pictures. You're skeptical as to whether this can really be entertaining, but you're an open-minded American and willing to try new things.If all of the above is true for you, then you will love this book."
5,This is a grand book.,"Trust me, it has everything. One of the best thrillers of all time and I've read tons of them. Please check Folsom out!Boo WalkerAuthor ofLowcountry Punch"
3,"Starts with a 5, ends with a 1, thus a 3!!","This book had a very interesting beginning. The convolutions and twists in the plot held my interest very tightly. However, at about the halfway point, it really started to become unbelievable. The ""hunters"" started drawing the most improbable conclusions, scientific anomalies became everyday events, and the infamous ""Fourth Reich That Never Was"" ending reared its ugly head. As a result, a novel with an impressive beginning worked very hard to bring about a horrendous ending.As a final note, I would like to say that the editing in this book was the worst I have ever seen."
2,Most fascinating plot by a lousy author I've ever read,"I can't disagree with readers who found this plot full of big surprises and powerful twists; a ""page-turner"" indeed. However, Folsom is a lousy writer. Bad! Careless construction, cliche-ridden vocabulary, and one of my pet peeves -multiple characters miraculously use the same contrivances to refer to things none of them had ever encountered before. As much as I stayed curious about what might happen next, I winced over and over again at the author's clumsiness. Where was the editor?! If you love good writing, stay away; if you love wild, preposterous but entertaining plots, wait for the movie!"
2,Incredibly average,"Oh please! The superlatives are better wasted on pulp such as ""Vanna Speaks."" What was all of the fuss about? I enjoyed it as a mindless romp thru spy-land but it was so full of incredibly unbelievable coincidences it was laughable. It was perfect beach trash; a book one can read while tanning, talking, and drinking beer."
3,"Not the best, but a good one","At first is a good book, it keeps you reading until the american doctor found the killer of his father 30 years ago, then the book is to long and repetitive with the investigation of the police of each crime (the interpol, the french and english police and of course Mr. Mcvey from LA).More or less at the middle of the book you will know why the people was murdered by the german people, and you will have to read it until you finish just to know exactly how was their plan of the future world.Nevertheless of the story, the boring part that is long and repetitive, the love story that is on the book, the end of it is amazing"
1,Truly awful,Do not bother with this book - go and read something by Le Carre or even an early Tom Clancy novel...this book could have been written by a 10 year old. I had guessed the general theme of the ending about a quarter of the way into the book.Terrible.
1,"Trite, stilted style, over-done and absurd.","If you are looking for good writing, or believable characters, or subtle insight into human motives, or even just a good, interesting yarn...then run as far from this book as you can! Apparently, Folsom thinks he knows something about psychology, science & technology, weapons, and police work. And perhaps he does know more about those things than he knows about writing...but he's very weak in all of them!This book deserves to be edited down to about 15 pages, and then burned."
3,Should be cut in half,"Great plot. Good main characters; however, there is so much filler, with the same thing said over and over with slightly different words, in too many places, making the book half again too thick. Lots of jumping around, new minor characters spilling out of most of the pages, along with the repitition makes for a lower rating than I would like to give."
3,"get book, skip kindle ed.","This book is without doubt one of my favorite action thrillers. Definitely worth the read. Kindle edition is fraught with typos, missing words and extra punctuation marks. That is the reason it gets only three stars."
3,Held my interest but flat ending,"I am purposely writing this review before I read any other the others. The book was very powerful and did a good job of developing the characters as the story proceeded. In many books with lots of characters I have to go back to figure out who is who - not in this one. I recognized them by name from the beginning.The story held my interest up to the last page, but the ending was very disapointing because it was obvious from about half way through. I kept hoping for a new twist that would be a surprise, but no. Dispite being very predictable it makes a good action adventure movie type read."
2,Great start that cannot deliver,"The book starts out great. Action, adventure and what promises to be a great plot. However, when you create an enemy that becomes so incredibly powerful, you no longer have a plot that is remotely believable. I became increasingly dissatisfied with the book as the plot wore on. The first third of this book was the only part worth reading."
4,A thrilling sensation,This is what I was left after an entire day reading the last 400 pages of this book. I am grateful I decided to read it on a weekend because the book was absolutely compelling and impossible to put down. A series of murders drive French and English police crazy. Seven deep frozen heads have been found and their identities remain unknown. Coincidentally an American doctor gets involved in an entangled mystery while trying to find the reason his father was murdered more than twenty years before. In the meantime an American detective is helping out and is convinced that the severed heads are the work of a serial killer. There also is this young and beautiful mistress of the future French prime minister who falls in love with someone else. All these people and many more find themselves connected and end up looking for answers while trying to survive a common but unknown enemy. Pure suspense in a breathtakingly story.
3,good read,"In places a thrilling read, so many type errors, I had to reread to try and figure what he was trying to say."
4,Thrilling from middle to end!,"While this interesting book jumpstarted from the very beginning I found myself skipping chapters to find out what happened, I myself do not enjoy this type of delayed response. The subject matter, however, was particularly interesting and it also posessed a surprising ending which are both good traits in a thriller novel such as this one. Because I love useless information, this book has become one of my favorites. I now know enough about surgery in absolute zero and the German military police to last me a lifetime. It also provided much food for thought, the prospect of being able to combine someones head to a foreign body is frightening. All in all, a great book!"
2,"First Half Good, Last Half . . . Yawn","I was looking for a good substitute for Hagberg or Flannery when I picked this one up. And the accolades seemed to bless the novel. Makes me think there's payola alive in the review circles.I won't bore you with a synopsis, you've probably read one above. Suffice it to say the author uses one of the most tired plot twists since the end of the Second World War. The best parts of this novel are the segments where the slippery Neo-Nazi seduces an unsuspecting American clerk, most of which happens during the first half of the novel. The details of these encounters are scintilating indeed. But you can get that stuff from a Forum magazine if that's cup of tea. I felt cheated getting that from over 400 pages of what was supposed to be a ""page-turning, gripping"" thriller."
5,"Brilliant, gripping, one hell of a read.",An international conspiracy of epic proportions. I defy anyone to put this book down. Must be in everyone's top ten list. If there is a better read out there then tell me!
5,If you only read one book in a lifetime - read this one,"This book was read in just a few days and I have to say that I eagerly await a second book. To sum it up I often enquire at bookshops where his second novel is after reading that he ""is currenlty working on his second"" on the fly sheet. If you only read one book in a lifetleme read this one. Does anyone know if there has been a second book ?"
2,Disappointing and predictable,"I read the majority of this book on a flight to England. It beat staring at the seat in front of me, but not by much. Way too many pages were spent setting up the reader for the ""shocking"" last sentence, but it was so obvious what was in the bo"
2,Gets lost under the body count,"After a promising start, this descends into a - 'Oh, the plot's flagging so let's throw in a few more bodies' - type of book. Also, I thought Fourth Reich books went out of style after the fifteenth Ludlum. If you finally make it to the end of this book, you'll feel more like a headless chicken than a headless ...... (insert infamous dictator of choice) for having been stupid enough to read that far."
4,Move over Hemingway!!!,"No, this is not going to be recommended reading in college campuses across the nation, but if you have many hours to kill (it's over 600 pages), you want to briefly suspend yourself from reality and you want to reminesce about all the places in Europe you have traveled, it's a good read. In between all of the European landmarks mentioned there is an elaborate sci fi thriller evolving...I only wish it ended in Germany or England rather than Switzerland"
1,Dangerous,"Allan Folsoms story is dangerous, because- despite the hair-rising story with many factual mistakes you can't put it down, losing yourself in the many ramifications of the plot,- even a fiction like that must not give rise to a Nazi-comeback phantasy. From a German point of view it is unbearable, that Germany - after more than 50 years - is still considered to be capable of committing such a crime against mankind."
2,Find a better use of your reading time,"Unpleasant and completely unbelievable premise; full of murder and meyham without a rational purpose. I should have listened to my inner voice to cease and desist when at the very onset of the story the author began his psycho-babble to lay a path for his 'hero'. But alas, I saw it through to the no-surprise end.I picked up this book based on reviews, which just goes to show that YOU SHOULD NOT BELIEVE ALL THAT YOU READ, including my words."
1,a howler,"This book is bad-- it occupies a territory somewhere between bad Ludlum and The Destroyer novels. Many of the situations are ludicrous, and it should have won some sort of Bulwer-Lytton award for some of its writing-- the line about the truck driver performing a tracheotomy on the 70-year-old nun with a Swiss army knife had me on the floor convulsed with laughter, as did the final, wildly improbably line (which I'll let you discover for yourself). I even wrote to Bill Pronzini, saying that if he should ever write another Gun in Cheek book, this and The Pledge (see my review) should be prime candidates for inclusion."
3,Ok for escapist entertainment,"If you just need something for light escapist entertainment, then this 700+ page book will keep you turning the pages for a while. A combination of thriller and detective/crime genres, with a love interest thrown in for good measure, this book reads like a script for a pop movie. Not bad, but not really interesting either. I was surprised by the escalating chaos and mayhem; I may never have read a book where so many ""good guys"" get killed, which I guess is a good thing as far as the building of suspense goes. I still can't tell why the absurdity of the plot twists didn't bother me... I guess I can say it is fun enough to not be bothered with following reality very closely. I would never had read it if I hadn't been stuck for a weekend with nothing to do. So if you just want a thriller to kill a bunch of hours then go for it, otherwise it isn't worth the effort."
2,"Perfect Triangle: Gripping Start, Tapering Off To Preposterous Ending","I found the opening engaging: a strange incident in a Paris cafe (all the best thrillers take place in Europe, don't they?). Things progress along interesting lines, there is some promising character development... and then it appears someone else took over writing the remaing three quarters of the book! Little more of interest emerges and we wrap up with a bizarre and silly ending.Read the first 10 to 50 pages for some fun, don't bother with the rest."
3,Good read if you need to kill time.,"I totally skipped the part about Lyberger and the New Mexico Physician until they reached Europe. There were pages and pages filled with this physician and her patient. Skipping it made no difference to the understanding of the story. It was kind of boring. If that part was trimmed, the book could have been much better.Otherwise, it's good to keep you awake till after 2 AM inspite of the unbelievable plot and the predictable ending."
4,Ultimate Page Turner,If you like non-stop action and intrigue and mystery this is one terrific book. I can't remember the last book I read that kept me as riveted.
3,Keep a notepad handy while you read this book...,"There are four things that would improve this book:1. There were too many characters. Each new character was introduced in excruitating detail. Once introduced, the character was not central to the plot and the character was later killed not more than one chapter later. There were just too many unimportant characters in the plot.2. More could have been done with the main character Paul Osborn. The fact that he had two wives could have been interesting. No ""history"" was given.3. The overall premise that a grown man would remember the face of his father's killer is too absurd. It's too coincidental to run into the killer at the openning sentence. Perhaps a better choice would be for Paul to do research and find the killer.4. Can't the author trim the story to 300+ pages and still convey the plot?"
