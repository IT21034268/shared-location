4,Hip hop will never be the same,"Soul-junk threw away the rules of hip hop. It's a noisy, chaotic jib-jab of poetry set to glitchy cuts, bad break-beats, symphonic bursts and cut-and-paste rhythms. Soul-junk knows how to spit rhymes, but it's so dense sometimes it detracts from the flow. Highly recommended for fans of underground and indie hip hop. It's too crazy to be a game changer, but it is undeniably legit."
2,Cute and nice idea.,"I liked the concept, but it didn't seem to actually work dependably. Basically we played with it for a day, but got frustrated by it not really working so well... and it went in a drawer. Better off getting one of those sharper image key locator's and clipping it to your childs belt loop, and using it to find them."
1,Waste of Money,This item does not work. The sensor has to be too far away from you to make a noise and it is not loud enough.
3,Just OK,"I work for the water department of a municipality. My job includes fixing water main breaks, water installations and general maintenance of water distribution systems. As you can imagine, I'm pretty rough on boots. After a month of owning these boots, while digging, I slipped and the edge of the shovel hit the shank of the boot. To my dismay, the shank cracked and there was a hole in the bottom of the boot. It did not leak, but it makes a cracking sound when I walk. That was about 5 months ago. The inside edge of the left boot (near the heal) must have given way, now it turns in. Like I said I'm hard on boots and I guess for the average user these boots would be fine. They held up better than some, but for the money I think they should have done better. I just ordered a pair of Chippewa's with a steel shank that are made in America."
5,Robert E Howard's undiluted vision,"I can give this nothing but 5 stars. Any real Conan fan is going to buy this knowing it is Howard's stories and none of the overly edited, or pastiche stories. Simply put, his stories as he wrote them, of one of the most enduring characters of fantasy fiction about eight decades on. Something entirely deserving of the hardcover format. The illustrations harken back to the pulp style. The publishers definately picked the right illustrator. I would venture, any real fan of fantasy literature, particularly Heroic-fantasy would want this to go next to similar volumes of Moorcock's Elric or Corum novels, and Lieber's Swords series.Those not familiar with Howard's original stories should not expect the comic-bookishness of the later Marvel comics series, or the High-fantasy of Tolkien and others. This is heroic-fantasy. Among the best, the most relevant to the development of the genre of Heroic-fantasy."
4,Definitely a good read,"I bought a few Conan compilations because friends of mine said that they enjoyed the stories. I also bought them to get some background information before the Age of Conan MMORPG comes out. This book definitely helped in that respect. It has various stories describing many areas in the Hyborian world. The appendices also give some background information that some may find helpful in understanding the world of Conan.One thing to know before reading this book is that the stories are in the order that they were written. This is not chronological order of how they occured. In fact the first story starts off with Conan as King of Aquilonia already. So, do not expect the stories to relate to one another and link. They are all separate stories (most submitted to be published in the magazines at the time) that can stand alone, but together they give you insight into another world."
4,At Long Last!,"The Conan character has been developed and embellished by a host of writers, but it was Robert E. Howard who gave him true immortality thanks to such towering stories as ""Red Nails"" and ""Queen of the Black Coast"". This book collects the first half of Howard's output, and the tales are presented in the actual order in which he wrote them. No pastiches or post-mortem collaborations, just the real thing distilled. The appendices offer some fascinating insight into the author's mind and the development of his Hyborian world."
5,It does not get any better than this!!!!!!,"I was introduced to REH as a kid by the ramblings of Roy Tomas in every issue of the 1980s black & white oversized Marvel Conan comic mags. In high-school I secured a compilation of his novels, essays, and short-stories through the sci-fi book club. His stuff has been VERY hard to come by...until now that is. I will without a doubt buy every Conan, Soloman Kane, Kull, or Bran Mak Morn compilation of REH that becomes available.This volume is a great read. Most of these stories were not contained in the other book I have. If you have not read this man's writings you need to step up to the plate. He smokes every modern fantasy writer. Very visceral and very intense writing. Also, this compilation has excellent art-work. And for only 15 bucks you NEED TO BUY THIS NOW!!!!!"
5,fantastic action packed well written story telling.,"This compilation of robert e howards prolific amoral barbarian is a must for every conan fan. These stories are so well written that you feel you are actualy in the ancient mythical world of hyboria. The illustrations within the book are a beautifull compliment to each story. I just wish the stories were longer since i am used to reading the full length novels but, most people like short stories so if you like action packed stories in faraway exotic places you will love this collection."
5,A must have for fantasy fans,"I will not bore you with a lenghty review, considering that there are plenty of reviews for you to read. Suffice it to say that if you are a fan of fantasy and are wondering whether this is truely a 5 star book, then think no more an buy it, because it is 5 stars!"
2,Kindle Version Lacks the Illustrations.,"While there already is a review highlighting the Kindle versions problems, it deserves repetition. The Kindle version lacks the illustrations and what makes this more regrettable is the fact that the description in the Kindle store took the description from the original paper copy and talks up the missing illustrations. There is also a forward in each book that is written by the illustrator discussing his work. Without the illustrations, the main factor for purchasing what are mostly public domain stories is lost."
5,"Finally, Howard's REAL genius shines...","I've collected many copies of old, worn out, out of print paperback books that had Robert E. Howard's Conan stories...edited and co-authored by Lin Carter or Sprague de Campe.I love those books...and cannot stand the modern ghost-writers, like Robert Jordan. Let alone what people have done to the Conan story with regards to the movies, though as far as Barbarian flicks go, I do like Arnie's first Conan movie...Anyways, this book is superior to the old out-of-print books I already owned. Howard's stories are published as originally published and in the order of publication. No re-organizing, no editing, no creative writing of the editor. Pure 100% Robert E. Howard's Conan.This book is the best purchase I've made in years!"
5,"good book, shopping experience was perfect, what do you expect from amazon, even if you didn't like the book i don't think you c","good book, shopping experience was perfect, what do you expect from amazon, even if you didn't like the book i don't think you could give it a bad rating, it is up to personal taste."
5,Can't say enough good things.,"Classic Conan at it's greatest. Unedited, brutal and intelligent. Just the way it was meant to be. Definitely worth every penny."
5,Conan,As I have said before Robert E. Howard ushered in an era that has brought Barbarians to what we think of them today huge warriors who swing heavy swords as easily as you or I would use a stick. Absolutely wonderful writing with great use of imagery to get his points across it was like watching a movie in my mind.
3,An unfortunate surprise with the quality,"Upon finding this collection, and being such a huge Conan fan, I immediately ordered it. I didn't expect the book itself to be much more than a standard paperback, but I was very disappointed to see that a large chunk of the pages were folded in half while also still being connected together at the edge where you are supposed to be able to open them to read. I understand pages sometimes don't get separated during manufacture, but, when it combined with the pages also being folded in such a way to cause the book to grotesquely bulge open in the middle, it was rather irksome. The collection itself is a fantastic set of stories fit for any fantasy lover, but because of these little annoyances with the finished product I am only giving it a three-star rating."
4,Great Collection!,I'm not going to review the stories as there are much better reviews here. The only thing I will say is that the only reason I didn't give this five stars was because they didn't use Frank Frazzetta's drawings/paintings. To me the two are almost inseparable and seeing the artwork in this collection was a little depressing (but they are well done).
1,$14 is FAR too much for a loose collection of Public Domain Works,"When reading the Kindle version, I find the stories are fine, but considering that most of the world holds these in the Public Domain, and in the US the copyright to the majority of them is questionable at best - this is ridiculous.The stories are good for the most part and the typeface seems reasonably well done, but the typical market value for EBook collections of formatted Public Domain works is $1 - $5, even on Barnes and Noble's site."
3,Avoid the audiobook,"This review is strictly for the audiobook version. Howard's stories will always rate 10 stars from me.When the good folks at Tantor decided to create audiobook versions of these stories, they must have actively searched for the one person alive who could not pronounce Cimmerian. Actually, Todd Maclaren mispronounces quite a few words in this collection, but none will so completely jar you out of the story quite like the constant sound of Cimmerian when it's pronounced sim-er-REE-an. I've also heard zam-or-REE-an (for Zamorian), as well as any number of normal, every day words that take several seconds to figure out due to the oddball way he says them. It is, in fact, so glaring that I've put Mr. Maclaren on my short list of narrators to completely avoid.I've kept my rating at 3 stars because I don't want to drag Robert E. Howard's creation down because of a lousy production. I think that Todd Maclaren has dragged it down enough already."
5,Conan Audio,I have been reading Howard's stories for 35 years and re-read them all the time. It is great having these yarns read to me on my long commute!
4,Pure Howard's Conan,"This is a lovingly put together collection of Conan writings.They consist in works by Howard alone, not any of his followers or editors; and they are sorted in the order they were published rather than according to the hero's age.The price is a good value for the 380 pages of pure narration, Howard-style. The reminder of the book contains a miscellanea of unpublished drafts, maps and accounts by the author and friends.The only problem I see with this edition is the illustrations by Mark Schultz. Although some of them are good, for those of us already spoiled by the superb work of Frank Frazetta on the Lancer/Ace edition covers, these don't come even close. Besides, they are clumsily placed in relation to the text, often acting as spoilers of paragraphs ahead."
5,Mmmmmm,"I loved this book and I will definetly buy the rest of the series. It has everything I love in an erotic novel. Sexy men, wonderfully erotic sex scenes, and plenty of action! It was well worth the read. This novel blended blood/gore/action/sex into one steamy kick-ass novel! It is about a group of hunters that happen to be aliens, that track down demons and kill them. On earth this woman also has psychic powers and she also tracks and kills the ones that have started showing up on earth. That attracts the sexy alien hunters and they approach her about working with them because something evil is afoot...and so begins the horde wars."
5,"Hot action, hot heroes, amazing heroine..","Get ready for a fast, hot ride into a world were the things that go bump in the night are real and there are amazing, more than mortal heroes who are willing to battle back the creatures of the night.I loved Cady and Sid's story, and the following tales are every bit as wonderful.But this isn't a sweet romance...it's a wild, wonderful, thrilling ride to true love."
2,Reader beware!,"I purchased this book because the premise looked interesting to me and I read great reviews about it. Unfortunately, the explicitness of this book overshadowed the plot. I also had trouble believing that Cady and Sid were in love instead of just lust. The sexual encounters were numerous and very explicit. It seemed as though the majority of the book was about the sex that Cady and Sid were having instead of the war that they were fighting.This book is not a love story. A physical relationship between Cady and Sid is not treated as something special or sacred here. (They actually let people watch them!) Beware! The underlying plot is interesting but, the writing style is not for everyone. I won't be purchasing another one of these."
2,Not too happy with it,"This product seemed great at first but has become very disappointing, the tabs attached to the seat part have bent after very little use and cannot be bent back into place making it a struggle to place and remove, you just hope you don't get splashed when trying to remove it. I am currently pregnant and it is very uncomfortable dealing with this, I need a potty that will allow me to easily lift the part I need to clean up. I am ready to buy a different one."
1,Pain in the Bum,If you want to spend your time wrestling to pull a potty apart and again to put it together this is the potty for you. This definitely was NOT designed with ease in mind. It takes longer for me to put it back together than for my son to use it. Hate it. Need to buy one with and easy slide out bowl.
1,Terribly designed potty.,"There are two Major design flaws that make this potty a disaster. The first problem is Elmo's hand. The toddler is supposed to high five Elmo to get ""encouraging phrases"". Unfortunately, Elmo's hand is right where my son's leg hits. As soon as he sits on the potty, it starts shreiking and doesn't shut up. This even annoys my Elmo loving son enough to keep him from sitting on it for more than a few seconds. The next problem is that the pee deflector just pops off. Any toddler can, and will, pop it off instantly. We had to run out to get a different potty right away. Leo loves Elmo but this potty is truly useless.al mom to leo"
2,"Does the job, but has a few flaws","This potty does the job, and my son likes it, but it has the following shortcomings:1 - The bottom of the receptacle is high enough that if a big poopy occurs, it touches your kids bottom, meaning more to wipe later on.2- It's easy to take apart, but awkward to clean, and there are bits that get bent when re-assembling, that if bent once all further reassemblies become annoying.3 - The electronics don't like water, so it's awkward to clean without ruining them. To make matters worse, if you have a boy that sometimes misses (even when sitting down), the miss tends to go right onto Elmo's hand, which is the button that you press to make Elmo talk, and is the thing that does not like moisture when you wash it.So, if your kid is a Sesame Street fan, go ahead and get this, but otherwise I would look for something more practical."
3,"Noisy, but ok","The pee deflector does pop right off. My son promply put it on his head! (before using the potty). My husband super-glued it on and now it's fine. It's better than another potty I bought (after the deflector came off this one), the other deflector was too small and pee went everywhere. So we went back for this one. Elmo's voice is a bit annoying, we're taking the batteries out."
1,Misleading Title - total waste of money,"This article has absolutely no information on ways to swim with dolphins. In fact, most of the article is completely unrelated to dolphins. This was a total waste of money, and I feel I was misled by the title. I would give it a 0 rating if I could."
1,Not Her Best,"I am a long time Ednita Nazario fan and LOVE the sensual quality of her voice. I own all her recordings and eagerly awaited Por Ti. I found it very disappointing. While the voice is just as intoxicating as ever, I find the material to be uneventful in view of the recent live recordings (Acustico), and her other cd's. I hope her next effort is more in tune to what her incredible potential is."
4,Great sound and rhythm. [Rebuena sonida y ritma.],"Chula is an excellent track--good lyrics, dance oriented and totally fun.[Chula es excelente--con liricas buenas, a bailar y divertirse.]"
1,Lo Peor de la Musica Latina,"Definitivamente muchos no estaran de acuerdo con mi opinion, pero Mana es la peor banda de rock latino. La culpa no es de ellos ni mucho menos, creo que Mana nunca debio dejar de ser lo que que siempre fue: una banda prefabricada, producto de Mexico, que nos tiene acostumbrados a inundar latinoamerica con musica basura y en serie. Solo les pido que tomen un tiempo y comparen a Mana con Soda Stereo, Presuntos Implicados, La Ley, Mecano, bandas que tienen un estilo propio y una historia. Mana solo gusta a los gringos."
5,LOS MAS PERRONES!!!,"Mana es el mejor grupo de todas las decadas. Las mejores canciones de Mana son Vivir Sin Aire, y Te Llore Todo Un Rio! Los comentarios con menos de 3 estrellas son los que no saben! Los mas CHINGONES!!!!"
5,Uno de los mejores albums de Mana,Siempre me gusto mucho el album desde que salió cuando era una nina. Todas las canciones de este album son buenísimas.
5,LOVE THIS CD !,"HAPPENS TO BE MY FAVORITE MANA CD , MY BROTHER;S TOO ! REMINDS ME OF MY TRIPS TO MEXICO CITY WHERE I FIRST HEARD THIS CD FAVORITE SONG IS THE PIES A CABEZA ,AND OYE MI AMOR I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS CD EVEN IF IT'S THE ONLY MANA CD YOU OWN !"
1,i love the songs but this cd is feak is not original :/,i am very dissapointend i've been buying cd at amazon for years n this is the first feak cd is not original
2,Disappointing,"It was not water resistant and when I called about it, I had to pay to have it fixed myself. Very disappointing."
4,Very Nice,This watch is very nice. I basically bought it because of the purple face. I have received lots of compliments on the watch.
4,Good everyday watch!,Keeps perfect time and looks nice for daily wear to work. Great price and quick shipping! Thanks!
1,Bad watch; no return,"I would be very cautious about buying anything from TimeZone123. The Invicta watch they shipped to me lost 30 minutes per day right out of the box, but when I complained, they refused to take it back."
4,Secret within...,"A very interesting book on two subjects: Astro and Geometry, applied to the markets. Although, the planetary dissertation is not appropriate for the beginner due to the complexity of the content, the Geometric part of the book is easy enough to follow.This book helped me finding a 'secret within' on the Geometric side of the book. Since it is a 'secret' i'll not reveal it here and now. It has helped make a lot of money, trading! I must recommend it for the Gann students alike since they will find easy examples on astro aspects and geometric angles, illustrated and explained in an easy way.If you're into 'traditional' trading styles à lá Dow Theory, you won't like this one...Me, well, I read it twice with increasing interest."
3,AM700 vs AM780 and M790,"Upon inspection the AM700 is clearly a consumer model compressor. The price is very good but I wouldn't expect the run time that we see with the am78 pump assemblies used on the AM780 and the M790's. The 700 has a visibly less expensive cylinder and motor assembly. It also requires more oil than the am78 pump, not to mention the cheezy air filter. I wouldn't expect this unit to survive on the construction site as the 780's and 790's have in the past years. Although as a consumer model I believe this unit is far superior to an oiless compressor.I will give Emglo credit for finally packaging oil with their hand carry units.Thanks, Ed Smith"
1,worst boyband ever!!,"these guys provide the worst collection of terrible noise i have ever had to put up with. they are not talented, they are not better lookin than your average, not because they cant dance or because they wear awful wannabe gangster clothes. Infact, i do not know why blazin squad is so 'awful' but they are simply disgusting in the most proposterous ways. the only thing i wud compare it to is, hang on, i wud compare it to just about every single pop song being released at the moment. its just irrelevant garbage."
1,Gibberish,"Heidegger -- like some others -- takes advantage of the common man's idea that the more difficult something it is to read, the more profound it must be. Yeah, so profound that you can't even understand it."
3,What would Nietzsche have thought of his Protege?,"""BEING PROFOUND AND SEEMING PROFOUND -- Those who know they are profound strive for clarity. Those who would like to seem profound strive for obscurity. For the crowd believe that if it cannot see the bottom of something it must be profound. It is timid and dislikes going into the water""_The Gay Science_, 173."
5,most intense season of an excellent series,"I intend this as a review of the third season, not just one episode. ""Season of Death"" might well apply to this whole year of the show. You need to watch it after you've come to know and understand the characters and the arc of the story. It's extremely intense and gripping. The characters propel themselves toward their fates and carry us along. It's storytelling at its finest. Don't miss it.I own the entire Farscape set on dvd and encourage you to take advantage to watch it here. It's one of the best scifi shows out there."
3,"great series, but dvds over-priced","the show was GREAT. Its too bad they are trying to rape all the fans by charging an insane price. I also enjoy the fact that it comes in such a HUGE case. Just one season of farscape takes about just about the same amount of room as THREE seasons of babylon 5. I guess if they are going to charge you that much for the dvd's, they want to put them in a huge box so you feel like you are getting more for your money. Oh and since i mentioned babylon ... the season package of dvd's is not only 1/3 the size, but also about 1/3 less in price as well.I give the show 5 stars, but only 3 for this product since its overpriced and over-packaged."
4,Original Science Fiction Adventure,"For the most part I enjoy this series. The living ship, Moya makes this an unusual story. You grow to love her as a character. The way the characters have developed into a family, protecting and fighting for each other is one of the pluses of the show."
3,Farscape Jumps the Shark,"Farscape's first two seasons were excellent. The first couple of episodes in the third season are pretty good too. But then, suddenly, everything completely went to hell. The two-part episode ""Self-Inflicted Wounds"" is absolute incomprehensible gibberish, and the show slowly slid downhill from that point onward. If you were to ask Farscape fans when Farscape jumped the shark, 90% of the candidate moments would be sometime during Seasons 3 or 4. All the major sharkjumping moments - from Zhaan's death to the Looney Toons episode to Aeryn's baby to that insane Season 4 wormhole garbage - happen either during, immediately after, or as a direct result of Self-Inflicted Wounds. It is the most aptly titled episode in all of TV history. Season 3 does have a few good, normal episodes, but the ""classic Moya misadventures"" feel is dead and gone.Brace yourselves - this is where Farscape starts sucking."
5,Another series that canceled too early,"Farscape, is a show that, like the Firefly series, was canceled way too early. Few shows on TV anymore have the imagination, variety, and chemistry as these shows that never get their due appreciation from producers and networks. Shows like Farscape glorify the concepts of determination and the human spirit and would benefit society if they were supported and marketed with a little more passion."
1,Rip-off.,"I'm sorry, but as much as I'd love to have this, with the price just being RAISED from $119 something to $134.99 I'll never buy it.In fact, the price increase is a screaming screw you to Farscape fans, I have lost interest in owning the rest of the series.At this point, I wish I hadn't bought the first 2 seasons to begin with."
4,Dr. B Does The Job,"This is an excellent series (and book) done in the 70's that has lasting value. Good segments with globe trotting backdrops all selected to reinforce the theme of the segment. Older video quality but not bad even on a 50"" plasma. Well with the money and a series you will watch again and again."
1,Great Series--Lousy Price,"Once again the US version of a beloved series comes out at a ""milk 'em and run"" price. If you have an all region player don't hesitate to buy the UK Region 2 version of this landmark program for about $40!!!!!! (currently on sale from Amazon.co.uk for 24.98 pounds). $149.95 list price for the American version?!?!?!? you've got to be kidding!"
2,Ascent of Man,"I saw this program when it was originally on PBS back in the 70's. I also took a course on it in college. I am embarrassed to say that when I put the first DVD in I fell asleep in the first 15 minutes. Maybe I'm too old now to appreciate this anymore. Great production, great scenes. Definately for the beginning scholar."
2,quality not so good,"I have worn and washed this product gently only a few times, however the elastic is already coming undone. I like the thong aspect, but the quality is not there for the price."
1,I Don't even want to give it ONE star...,"""Firm Control""? ...that is total crap... This product is flimsy and thin. Instead of FIRMING things up, SLIMMING things down, or CONTROLLING the jiggle of unwanted fat/ rolls, this product took my many LITTLE rolls and turned them into one BIG roll that makes me look like I am PREGNANT! I am uploading a pic of my wearing this product under a dress I bought. Check them out!"
4,Nice For the Price,"I do miniatures in one-inch scale and these tweezers seem to be just the thing. I am particularly interested in the locking tweezers. The packaging was awful. I had to rip the cheap plastic case apart to get the tweezers out and it got tossed. The tweezers are not the highest quality, but for this price, they are a bargain and they'll last a good little while. If they last a year, I'll be more than pleased.Delivery was prompt with no troubles at all. I might not buy this particular set again, but I'd recommend it to someone who wants to explore the different kinds of tweezers before making a purchase of a more expensive, higher-quality pair of a specific kind.Overall, Happy with the purchase."
2,"Violence and Compliance, Not Character","Ryan and Wynne are leaders in the character education movement, yet they believe that the only way for a child to develop character is for expert authorities to inculcate it. Many educators, such as Alan Block, see such authoritarian, didactic forms of education as doing violence to children. Steeped in extrinsic motivations that retard generosity in later life, this form of education is being supported by the Bush administration because it tends to make good soldiers and good consumers, not good people. Four Arrows (Don Trent Jacobs) www.teachingvirtues.net"
3,functional,"I was able to connect to my WEP enabled wireless network and register a SIP connection to my openpbx installation with relative ease. The sound quality seems pretty good. However, there are several shortcomings for this phone. The battery life is abysmal. I can get maybe 36 hours of standby. The documentation is spotty. I tried to perform a firmware upgrade, but the web interface doesn't seem to work. Maybe it's just me and the lack of documentation. The phone itself seems to provide some upgrade tool, but the documentation does not mention it and the Linksys site provides no URLs matching its configuration. The buttons feel cheap, but work passably well. In summary, as my title indicates the phone is functional. I would recommend shopping around for a better alternative."
3,Good single but 66% of it on the album,"The radio edit of space walk really takes not much away fro m the original, just cut back a bit of the filler and long parts of the original.Pushy is an ok bside with a spoken word question and answer session between and older man and a kid about being pushy to get your way. A bit long at 7 min.Finally you get the album version of return to patagonia, nothing new here from lost horizons.Not the greatest single but every track blends into the background much like most lemon jelly songs."
4,Very Nice!,Quick response for just what I was looking for. Thanks! The right item at the right price and received it in time to give as gifts.
3,Cumbersome to use and try is a bit too shallow to catch all the grind/leave,Also very small and delicate so you feel like you are going to drop it at any given moment. Nice idea... but I wish I could return the two I purchased... Will probably try to sell it back (what a rip on S&H too)
5,nice book,Officer christensen is very detailful on his days as a police officer and also gives opinion on important subjects no bs
2,"for teachers, not students","The author deals more with the philosophy of fighting and how to teach it than the practical knowledge that i was looking for. There are just a few pictures which made it very difficult to understand when he would describe a technique. Also, too many ""war stories"" its not what i wanted in the book."
2,an editing disaster,"My comments are not about the subject matter or the quality of the writing--the book looks quite interesting and I was looking forward to reading it--but about the failure of whoever prepared the kindle edition to edit it properly. It is loaded with errors which make it unreadable. It's obvious that the hard copy was scanned using optical character recognition (OCR), but that no one went over it and edited it after the scanning. OCR is pretty good, much better than when it was new back in the 90s, but it still makes a lot of mistakes, especially in a text with a lot of foreign words like this one. The publisher needs to reissue the kindle edition after correcting this problem. I got so frustrated trying to read it that I deleted it from my kindle."
3,Excellent story but a difficult read,"This is an incredible story that needed to be told, but I think the telling leaves a lot to be desired. I had a hard time with this one. The use of dialect was both distracting and confusing and I often had trouble following the storyline. It moved along in spurts, holding my attention for a little while, then losing it when the story floundered. I really had to push myself through the last half of this book and ended up skimming and skipping through parts of it. I'm an avid reader and in my entire life, I can only remember two books that I didn't finish - several times I thought this was going to make a third. But I struggled through it and, in the end, I'm glad I finished it.It doesn't seem right to complain about a free book but if I'd paid for it, I'd have felt that I wasted my money. It's a shame because the story itself has the potential to be a blockbuster. I just wish it had been put in the hands of an author that could have done it justice."
3,"Case works well, but has some problems","The case is good looking and functions but the side lock opens too easily I'm afraid my iPod will fall out of the case and the bottom rubber gasket to protect the 30 pin connection is useless, it falls off the unit, I lost mine within a day."
5,"Supperb book, probably the best in this series","The story so far of the F-22A. The develloping story from the early days till present times is remarkable and really made me read page after page. The cherry on top of the cake are the photos - they are almost all full color. Previous titles were mostly black and white with a small center color section, this one is totally color except some archive pics of develloping mock ups that are b&w. But these are a minority. Jay Miller made an excellent job tracing the story of this awesome aircraft. Modern jet fans will love for sure. Highly recommended"
4,Good Book on a Questionable Airplane,"Jay Miller tends to do good work, but the books are seldom balanced - always coming off a bit like a cheerleader for whatever subject he is writing about. A case in point is the F/A-22 book. The airplane is undoubtedly pushing the state of the art, but it has had a constant string of troubles that are not addressed in this book. Then the entire policy issue of why the USAF needs this airplane, or how 100 F-22s are going to replace 1,000 F-15s and F-16s. Still, if you are interested in the F-22, this is a good place to start."
4,We want Tasty,I too was hoping to find Tasty on CD...If enough of us ask for it maybe it will happen :-)
4,Excellent but no Tasty,"There is only one Good Rats sound, and it is here. But I am still waiting for Tasty on CD."
1,AWFUL!!,The book was missing the whole middle of the alphabet of drugs. Approx 75 pages missing. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!
4,pleased,I'm in the process of reading this book. It arrived very timely and in very good condition. I'm pleased with the service and promptness.
4,Beginner's guide with very high quality,"It's a tiny book, but it contains various materials with high quality which lead us to the core of Politics. Obviously it is helpful to beginners such as undergraduates (especially freshmen). It's a tiny book, and so students in Non-English area could read it easier."
4,Good if you don't have to use them,"I purchased 2 of these just because of the laws in Texas which requires you to have a life jacket for each person if you are on an inflatable boat (or any boat). The vest does not fit perfectly on your body, but it looks solid and of good material. Hopefully that emergency situation never shows up.This seller is very slow be careful."
4,Good teaching never dies,I enjoyed this CD very much. It was very descriptive. I learned some techniques that I will diffently use as I sew fashions for myself and others. It reenforce old methods and gave me new ones. I know it was an older series but some methods never die and Couture Techniques is a great source.
1,Rubbish,I cannot offer a review of this item as I have not received it. The money for the item was taken from my bank account on 1 December 2010 but I am out of pocket. Will not use this company again
3,For Fine Sewing,This is a great DVD if you like to do Counture sewing. I bought this vedio because I need a dvd that can show me how to do something over and over. I like to sew for my children and this is a DVD for adult sewing. So if you want to sew for yourself then I think you should get it. If you like wearing your sewing for the office then this is a must also. I can use some of techniques she shows like a blind button whole for dresses. If you want soemthing for children this is not the DVD to get.
3,"This is an ""okay"" anchor.","I was very excited to receive my new Seaboard Foundry American Made Mooring Anchor but unfortunately, it was not as attractive in person as I was led to believe. Nevertheless, it is an okay anchor and I have great hopes for the anchor makers at Seaboard Foundry. Keep up the okay work, guys!"
4,Nice package,Cute books. Like the packaging. My 16-month-old son likes taking the books in & out of the box as much as he does reading them.
1,junk do not buy,"Absolutely terrible product. The end caps fall off when the dog runs. The volume went out and it costs $40 to fix, and they claim to be water resistant but I do not believe them. To turn them on or off you rotate the end cap and they never match up. Buy the tritronics one for $100 instead.."
5,This is really for dummie,"This book helps you out on everything, from installing Linux to getting internet on it using applications, listening to music on a very ""english"" based language writen for everyone to understand. I also found this book very entertaining because of small jokes here and there that made the book better and easier to read. I would really recommend this book to anyone starting to use linux."
1,It takes a LOT for me to slam a book...,"I don't think anyone actually tried handing this book to a non-Linux user (i.e. a Dummie), giving them a PC, and letting them try it. The instruction step literally at one point said ""If you don't already know how to use (a tool), we reccommend you not use it"" then went on to another topic. That would have been fine, except the fact was, you couldn't follow the steps in the book as laid out in the book without using that tool. Other instructions were skimpy, missing, or wrong. Seeing as how you can download Linux free on the web and burn your own CD, the only reason to buy this book for 30$ would be easy to follow instructions. Which this book DOES NOT HAVE. An awful book. And I've been using Shell for 9 years, while rebuilding Macs and PC (desktops and servers) for 6 years!"
3,Well...,"I don't really have this particular book. But I do have an earlier edition of ""Linux for Dummies"", which this book must have come from. I admit, it is useful (and has a CD in the back), but this really isn't ""For Dummies"". The author uses technical terms that are way above the famed ""Dos for Dummies"" and it jumps around from topic to topic too erraticly. I suggest the Red Hat Tutorial that is included with Red Hat Linux if you are truely new to Linux.Still, this is useful."
1,Junk,Overly sensitive to any stimulus. At time will not properly arm itself and go silent. The only good attribute is that it is very loud.
5,Perfect,"I spilled a drink on the keyboard of my HP laptop. Computer and mouse pad still worked fine but nothing on keyboard except ""B"" key would work. Should know not to drink and surf at the same time. Anyway, I found instructions on line for replaceing the keyboard. This one came quick and was pretty easy to install. Just have a set of tiny screwdrivers handy. Computer works perfectly once again..."
5,Very Fast Response,I am very happy with this item. I recieved it four days after I bought it and it was easy to install
2,Definitely not the way to start your love of Francis..,"As a really big Dick Francis fan, I would be really sad if someone heard all these great things about this author, picked up this book, and then never tried another book again. It's not a very good one. The premise is good, the characterizations as usual are very nice, but the plot goes nowhere and stays there from about halfway in until the last, disappointing page. Changing narrators in the book was a nice risk, but it ruins everything. Having the book be about computers and then putting in a 14-year gap was also not the wisest thing. If you want to start off on the right Francis Foot, try PROOF or WILD HORSES or ENQUIRY, and there you're neck-deep in characterization, plot and thrills. Francis is a master, but even masters have an off day."
5,Love Dick Francis,I read the whole series several times over and am so happy to be able to read it AGAIN on my kindle!
3,fun read,"This was the first novel I've ever read by Dick Francis, and although the plot wasn't particularly earth shattering and didn't always make sense, I still found the novel to be enjoyable. The characters were interesting and easy to relate to, and Angelo, the antagonist, although not a very deep character, was certainly a dangerous one. I thought not every aspect of the plot was well thought at, and at times I didn't really feel a strong sense of danger for the characters. Despite it's flaws, Twice Shy was enjoyable.Carl Alves - author of Two For Eternity"
2,Out of the Race,"TWICE SHY by Dick Francis is an off day at the track. Jonathan Derry is a nice enough young physicist who acquires some musical tapes, which are in reality a fancy computerized betting system. But in the world of computers a hiatus of fourteen years doesn't work and neither does the change in narrators.Add TWICE SHY to your collection by all means, but try WILD HORSES for a trip into the power of Dick Francis.Nash Black, author of WRITING AS A SMALL BUSINESS and SINS OF THE FATHERS."
3,great characterization in search of a plot,"As already noted in the reviews, Control has some wonderful characters-- the housewife painter Edith Mazursky, the killer Billy Boy, the erudite cop Eric. Unfortunately, the plot itself (a convoluted conspiracy theory about reincarnation and time travel) doesn't hold up and feels rather hackneyed. Possibly that's because the ground has been covered so much since Control was written."
3,Pelicula con mucha accion y drama de la vida real.,Pedro navaja es una pelicula un poco fuerte de contenido. Tiene una mezcla de sexo y violencia que no es para el gusto de todos los videntes. La pelicula tiene un contenido comico y sexual simultaneamente. La recomiendo para mirar con su esposa o con quien se sienta intimo. Es una gran pelicula con uno de mis actores favoritos.
4,Great movie so so quality,The shipping was very fast and packaged very well. The movie is a classic and well made. I would also recommend El Ratero de la Vecindad 1 - 1983
5,VERY SATISFIED,I AM VERY HAPPY HOW QUICKLY I RECIEVED MY DVD PEDRO NAVAJA.THE DVD IS GREAT AND IN VERY GOOD CONDITION. I WILL RECOMMEND OTHERS IN BUYING FROM AMAZON. AMAZON THANK YOU FOR YOUR GREAT SERVICE.
2,No sense of direction,"This book comes much closer to being an autobiography than a biography. Only about half of the book is really about Bob Wills, and it's a poorly-written book to boot. It's similar to listening to someone just ""ramble"" all over the place, from one subject and time period to another, with little or no warning. It never flows and is hard to follow. The only reason I give it even 1 star is for a few bits of information about Bob Wills that I might not have read anywhere else and it does have some good pictures."
3,Good Book has some good points,"As one other reviewer states, this is unfocused and that is due largely to the face that she wrote this book with Charles Townsends' book open before her, I think. Not enough private or personal information that is really important."
2,More about Diocletian than Constantine -- and with a bias,"Don't bother with this one. Burckhardt was a 19th century academic with an ax to grind against Constantine and a mission to rehabilitate the Christian-persecuting Diocletian. He pursues both of those ends with blind and tedious enthusiasm.The book takes about 240 pages just to get to Constantine at all, as Burckhardt loses his focus amid 60 page digressions on pagan practices in the ancient Mediterranean world.Perhaps most annoyingly, the modern translator has seen fit to strip out all of Burckhardt's references which makes the book into an unverifiable manifesto as opposed to a serious scholarly work.There are much better and more accessible works out there on Constantine and his times than this one, such asConstantine and the Christian Empire, just to give one example. Or, if you prefer to go straight to the primary source, try:The Life of the Blessed Emperor Constantine: From AD 306 to 337 (Christian Roman Empire Series, vol. 8)."
3,The story just dragged.,The story line was interesting but the she always drags out her story. I started skipping paragraphs because it was starting to get boring.
4,"Great book, helps you understand God's promise to you.",This book really helped me focus on what I needed to enhance my relationship with the Lord. I learned how to seek the Holy Ghost and how His presence could change my life. It taught me about God's promises to me and what I needed to do to be in-line with them. A must for Christians seeking direction and even for those desiring a spiritual walk but don't know where to start.
4,The Promise by Tony Evans,The Promise should be required reading for all Christians. It covers the Ministry of the Holy Spirit completely and accurately. This is a subject many pastors do not understand let alone teach. Tony Evans book covers the subject completely and in language that a child could understand.I recommend this book to anyone regardless of denomination. To the non Christian it will be interesting reading however the finer points will not be evident. The Promise outlines the personal relationship one must have with Jesus Christ in order to receive the gift of salvation.Religion will not in its self suffice as this is mans attempt to attain salvation through merit. Salvation is bought and paid for by the blood of Jesus Christ and it cannot be atained through works. This book covers the subject very well.
4,Very please!,Thank you for your prompt response and the good condition of my book. I recieved it as good condition and without the binding broken into.
4,4 stars,Would've been perfected if the pages weren't dented and crinkled. The book was basically new with exception to the dents In the book and pages.
1,Downright Dirty Shame,"Ducey may think of himself in many ways, and I know personally that he does. But it is indeed a downright dirty shame that he is still chugging out sludge after all these years.Ducey is a half-baked wannabe who just won't give up and get a real job. Blues he ain't, and this recording shows it. Take up golf Robbie, and go home!"
4,Cross-cultural world music that works.,"I am usually skeptical of cross-cultural world music experiments, but this one works. It is really immaterial whether these Swedes know anything at all about Haiti - this band can play! The title track shows off a wicked polyrhythmic groove, while the slow songs typically have fine, extended horn solos. Highly recommended!"
2,Disappointed,"When this product first arrived it worked very well having a ton of suction.I am not sure what happened, but within 2-3 weeks the suction has decreased to the point that I do not use the product any longer. Cleaning the tank and filter does no good the the suction is basically gone."
3,Too Soon To Tell,"Although the shop vac works very well and was easy to assemble, it seems a bit on the light side, especially the attachments. Since my online purchase I have also found similar machines with the same HP at Sears and HD for much less. Bottom line, however, is that so far the machine works well and seems to have lots of power. Its just too soon to tell......."
4,Great Product,"When my husband requested a wet dry vac for Christmas I was a bit panic stricken as I know nothing about choosing that sort of product. After a little research I selected this item and hoped for the best. My husband who runs a plumbing and heating company has said this product has saved the day more then once. It's great for cleaning up debris after a dirty job. His comments are that it has lots of power and suction, a good selection of attachments and it is very quiet. A great, reliable product at a good price. We recommend it."
3,It'll Do,"The original shipment arrived without a caster insert. Not sure who was responsible, Amazon or ShopVac. Returned and a replacement was promptly sent. The unit performs as described. It works o.k. for routine vacuuming (workbench, autos, etc.), but the 3 hp motor underperforms for getting dog hair and fibers up. The floor/upholstery tool is cheap-- needs a fiber insert to work up imbedded material. The more expensive 6 hp units probably perform better. It would be nice if it had a locking caster to keep it from rolling down the driveway when vacuuming the cars. The cord is very short and an extension cord is required. I haven't used it for the wet application, but suspect it works just o.k. as well."
1,tiny objects only,"as a dry vac, you will spend more time unclogging the hose. the hose only has an 1"" opening if your really have a job for this shop vac, that you wouldn't ask of your vacum cleaner it's going to be stop and go detaching the hose to reatach it to the blower side to try to get something minor as paper not over the size of a bubble gum wrapper with 3 small less then an inch dirt clogs will stop this shop vac in it's tracks.. Pros,, can see how it would make a decent wet vac for just having to suck up water.... Seems like a decent motor and power to it..."
4,Sucks like mad (in a good way),"I have been very happy with this little Shop Vac; it has more attachments than I would ever need and has enough power to help me clean up water in the basement and all the other odds and ends about the house. My only complaint is with the length of the power cord, which cannot be loner than six feet. You must have a extension cord handy unless you want to move it from outlet to outlet."
4,shop-vac good,I needed a vac that could run for a half hour steady and still last at a low price. So far this shop-vac has met that and is running strong. It picks up the fine dust in my work space which is what I need. The only complaint is the power cord could be longer.Shop-Vac 962-06-00 6-Gallon 3-Horsepower Ultra Plus Wet/Dry Vacuum
5,Excellent!!!,"I really enjoyed this lil book, although I found that reading it in the doctor's office was probably not the best place! They interrupted too much and I was enjoying it a bit too much to be in public reading. It had a lot of excellent ideas in it and was a lot of fun to read!"
5,Great story!,I'm buying this book for my child because when I was little it was one of my favorite stories. I hope that he will love this story of a mother kangaroo and her baby as much as I did when I was young.
2,Boring.,"I bought this book because it was highly rated by Amazon viewers. I was looking for a children's book about something related to Australia since we are moving there. The mother kanagroo doesn't have a pocket so she asks other animals how they carry their babies. What my children thought was weird was that she asked lions and monkeys, (as opposed to other Australian animals like koalas, etc...) ""Kanagroos don't live in Africa, Mom!"" (We used to live in Africa.)My children and I think that the story is boring."
5,"Loved this book as a kid, bought to share with my new daughter","Having a daughter in June, can't wait to read this book to her. It was a favorite of mine as a child."
5,childhood favorites,"This was my son's favorite book. Now that his childhood friends are having children of their own, this book is always included in baby shower gifts. hope this title stays in print"
2,Meh. Not really worth the time.,"This is a story about a kangaroo who needs to find a way to carry her joey. After asking around and finding other people's methods don't work, she goes to the city where she gets an apron with TONS of pockets, and everybody is happy, etc. etc. etc.It's not a bad book, per se... it's just that I find it really weird that the animals listed here are not found together in nature. It's one thing to have predators speaking to prey, that happens in picture books all the time, but to have African animals talking to Australian animals, and to have Woodland animals conversing with Savannah animals? It's a little weird, is all.And the book is a bit wordy, a bit too long for the story it's telling. It's not really *all* that interesting."
2,Lighted switch,It works! What else can you say about a light switch. Ordering from the Acehardwareoutlet site was a horrible experience. I would never order from them again.
2,Very good opera poor CD quality,I bought the CD as a present for my father.When I got it I was very unplesantly surprised that the sound of the recording is dull( it was made originally in 1961) and it was not digitally retouched although according to the descrition the CD was made in 2000.I contacted the seller regarding the problem no response at all.I dont recommned that CD if you are looking for good sound quality.Ovearall the opera is a masterpiece.
4,About what you should expect for the price,"I was hoping for 72 different figurines, but there are around 10 - 12 unique figurines that you receive multiples of. The quality is as expected. For the price, I'm not really dissatisfied, I was just hoping for more uniques for my purpose."
1,Fisher Paykel Dish Drawer,"This was one of the worst investments that I have ever made. The dish drawers are very unique in their exterior design. That is what caught my eye. I started having problems about two month later after purchasing them. It was under warranty but no one in my area could fix them. The company is not very helpful either. From now on, I will play it safe and stick with Kenmore or Kitchenaid. At least technicians are familiar with repairing them, and believe this, you will need repairs with the Fisher Paykel models."
1,Try Remington Smart System Titanium Instead,"The instructions advise you to wait until the batteries are almost depleted before charging (to preserve battery life). That's fine, except for the fact that there is no battery gauge. Are you supposed to wait until the shaver stops and then wait 6 minutes for a quick charge? Poor design and poor shave to boot."
4,Not so sensative,"I've owned the 8825 xl for about a year now, I used it religiously for the 3 months that it recommends, but not much changed after the initial 4-5 weeks. The sensativity settings are pretty much useless, and I've found that setting it to a ""more sensative"" setting is actually a little more irritating, as it takes MANY more passes to get the close shave. The built in trimmer is noisy, but otherwise works fine.I previously owned the Norelco Advantage 5615(the one with the Nivea lotion dispenser). I found that the Advantage does a much better job for my sensative face/neck, I wish I would have replaced it with another Advantage. If sensativity isn't an issue, this is a great razor, it cuts VERY close and the battery last for what seems like forever. It's rather robust too, as I've dropped it once or twice in the shower with no apparent damage. If sensativity IS an issue, go with the Norelco Advantage 5615."
3,not new as ordered,I received a refurbushed product instead of new as ordered. So I was not pleased but the company gave me a complete refund when I returned it so I was very pleased with that.
4,Good value,"For $70, this is a great electric shaver. Before I bought this one, I was using a basic Norelco for seven years. The Spectra is better since it gives you a closer shave, recharges quickly, and because you can use water to clean it. And in terms of appearence, the blue and silver looks nice."
3,A moderately good story,"This book is okay, but the surprising thing about it is that every other Hazel Wilson book I have ever read is incredible. If you like this, then read: The Red Dory also by Hazel Wilson."
3,Comfort scent,"So many orientals are heavy; this is one is soft. It smells like warm, spiced milk. It also smells quite synthetic. If perfume were clothes, then Diesel Plus Plus Feminine would be loose sweatpants--all comfy pleasure to wear, but not terribly chic."
1,'Teach Yourself' because the book doesn't,"This is the worst computer related book I have ever read. Each chapter introduces some topic of C/C++ programming(variable in one, functions in another, etc.) almost at random. The rest of the chapter will introduce a new topic of Windows programming using Visual C++. The problem is that it doesn't teach anything. Williams simply walks through the steps he takes to make a program without explaining why he is doing it or what predefined functions and classes mean. His method of teaching is so bad that the material that I am already familiar with makes very little sense. Bottom line: This book is of little to no help in teaching Visual C++."
5,good intro to Visual C++ for VB and C++ programmer,"I am new to Window Programming, and the project I suppose to accomplish needs to be written under Visual C++ environment. I found this book easy to read; however, I think that it would take longer than 24 hours to finish and understand everything in the book including the excercises. If you do not do the exercise you probably will finish the book in 24 hours, but you have missed the important point. Of course this is not a book for Advance Visual C++ programmer."
2,"If you are a beginner, don't buy it !!!","This book is really confusing, there are lots of examples without showing how to accomplish them. Readers must try by themselves. I don't recommend buying this book!!!"
4,Great book,"This book is really great, it actually teaches you Visual C++ in 24 hours. It would be a good idea to learn a bit of C++ before you get started. Great for just looking up some specific topic"
1,Videos shot Amateur style,These videos are amateurish and contain very little factual information or footage about the real crimes. Don't waste your money. This director took too many creative liberties to make money and I want my money back.
3,KINDRED SINK WRONG THICKNESS,"I like the sink, but I was going to send it back to Amazon. They claim that the sink is 18 gage SS and it is only 20 gage SS. Check the Kindred web sight, 20 gage SS is 25% thinner than 18 gage. The thinner SS will dent easer and be noise. The price is write, you have to decide if it will work for you."
5,Stainless Steel Sink,"I returned the sink because it was not what we wanted after all, so I returned it unopened.Thank you,Mark Ward"
2,Book is just too hard to comprehend,"This book has its high points. The exercises are to the point and easy to understand, but yet somewhat hard to do. However, the text has the problem many accounting books I have seen have, that is the fact it contains too many in-text examples and not enough to the point study points for someone who just needs to know the principals for quick and easy studying. If a course you are in requires this book you best go looking for an additional study manual for study help."
5,The games afoot!,"I enjoyed this so much I named my Son after one of the Characters! Truthfully I can't get enough of it. I absolutely love the way they begin each Episode, Dr. Watson inviting us in as he stokes the Fire, tells us a bit about his Dogs and shares a glass of Perti Wine. You feel as though you're right there the sound(s), speech are very clear. For those who watch Basil Rathbone & Nigel Bruce in the Movies you'll enhance your appreciation for not only these Actors, but the Mysteries as well. The only thing mysterious about this and the other Discs in this Collection is...why you're reading my Review when you could have already ordered them!?"
4,Not too shabby!,"If it just had an integrated magnetic compass I would have gone 5 stars. I would not be afraid to layout a small construction project with this, but I would definatly take cross measurement and trig things out if it were going to be a small house. I see no problems for deck layout/leveling, plumbing, etc... Ok for map drafts, but not for survey if ownership or lawsuit issues might result. The very low price I paid was good for at LEAST one of the stars!"
1,Biased Anti-Catholic Screed,"A high fraction of the membership of the Lincoln Brigade was Communist.The Reds (aka Republicans) in Spain were simply monsters.They burned down churches, murdered Catholics, tortured people in their numerous Chekist prisons.Outside of the Basque provinces, in Republican Spain, you could not go to church, could not wear a cross.Amazon is currently selling the latest edition of Hugh Thomas's ""The Spanish Civil War."" Fair and balanced.Also, a recent English translation of Gironellla's ""The Cypressses Believe in God"" is available at Amazon.Much better investments for those without invincible anti-Catholic biases."
2,Where Is The Child?!,"Honestly, the first time I watched this movie was at night, half awake, and I had to watch it again the next day to be sure I had seen what I thought I had. The reviewer who stated this was a pilot for a show was a big help, I couldn't comprehend why the movie took such a side turn to the story with Kim Cattrall's kid! Dan O'Herlihy's entrance to the story was hysterical (his opening line is the title above). Dack Rambo's character is so obnoxious I can't believe his would-be girlfriend didn't have him arrested for stalking her. The opening sequence was good, and as stated above Richard Lynch is calmly creepy as Satan on Earth, but the subplot (or maybe it was the main plot?) was out of left field. And then it just ends. WTH? This was in a collection of 16 horror classics I received for Christmas, and worth watching once, I suppose, but otherwise forget it."
5,Great Find!,"I wanted to replace an old defective remote dimmer. Turns out the dimmer had been discontinuted. I could not find anywhere locally. Amazon was the only place on the internet that had a replacement. Dimmer was exactly as advertised, brand new in sealed package, fast delivery and works great! Very happy shopper!!"
1,Does not provide full light,"For some reason, this switch does not allow the full amount of light through the fixture. It seems to light fixtures to only about 80% of their total. I have even tried this with a very simple fixture. I can NOT recommend this dimmer!"
3,Not as good as the first album,I was disappointed as the first one was so great and easy to fall asleep to. I wish they would stick to great songs and music.
3,Disappointed,"I was not too please with the music on this CD, even though I speak Spanish. I hope to look for a more current CD."
4,Missing Song!,"The Il Divo song, ""Somewhere"", is hard to come by which is why I wanted ""Siempre"" so much. The 'Siempre' case lists'Somewhere' as a bonus. Not so!!!!!!! Instead ""You Raise Me Up"" was substituted. Not fair!Dee Knight"
3,Siempre,"Just found this fantastic mix of voices last fall. Listen to their music most everyday while I work in my studio. Have a ticket to see them in LV next week. AS to the Siempre CD, the choice of music is not my favorite. Ancora 2006 & their Christmas Collection 2005 are THE BEST. Awaiting their newest album, coming soon. This group has hit the jackpot in life! Very uplifting for me to hum along."
3,quite nice,Quite a romantic music for those who enjoy the genre. But the songs are very alike. Good for driving in the car- I hope in the future they will have more original songs than covers in Spanish and Italian.
3,Same old stuff,"I love their voices, but I wish they'd break out and do something different. Their previous CD's were wonderful (and I highly recommend them), but they're a young group! Why do they only seem to like performing songs that would be appropriate for a group in their 70's?"
5,IL DIVO IS THE BEST!,"I love the way these gentlemen sing and the way they blend their vocal talents together. I have all their CD's, and they just keep getting better and better. Their CD's are an automatic buy for me.I also have their piano books and the purchase was worth the price. I highly recommend all their CDs and piano books."
1,What a waste...,"The songs in this CD were sang by thousand other singers million times. Unless if it's done differently with new arrangements, new style, better performance it's a total waste. My suggestion, please find new songs, there are plenty out there. Give the new writers a chance, pay them few dollars and give them some royalties. And you IL DIVO, will sound more unique and different. After all you have great voices."
2,disappointed,"I think they all have beautiful singing voices, but when aired on TV they sang in English, most of the CD was a different language and I was very disappointed with it"
4,Il Divo - be still my heart!,"I love these guys, love almost every song they do. While this isn't my favorite CD they have done (and I have them all), it is a very nice one. I love all their voices, so unique and different and yet they blend so nicely. If you aren't a fan yet, you will be!"
2,I Hate to Say It: Lackluster!,"I preface my review of Siempre by stating I'm a huge Il Divo fan and have seen them in concert once. It was an amazing show! I frequently listen to their first two albums, which I really enjoy. However, my least favorite Il Divo songs are the ones where they take a once popular English song and transform it into a version in another language. With that said, I'm somewhat disappointed with Siempre. Of the nine new songs, most of them fit the pattern I mentioned before. This time, they chose songs that I'm either tired of or didn't like the first time around. So here I sit with a new CD I have no desire to listen to again. I'm hoping it will grow on me."
2,English Please,I just bought 3 CD's for gifts after hearing Il Divo on several TV shows this week. They sang in English and why would I not expect their CD to be in English also? No one said it would not be in English and not a word on Amazon that it was not in English. The music is beautiful - but I would appreciate being able to understand the lyrics. Very disappointing!
5,Awesome,"I love these fellows....I have 4 of their cds. They, by far, are my favorite. I wish I could see them in person."
2,Not their best...,"Considering the fact that I love Il Divo and their exceptional voices, this CD was a major disappointment. The songs are blah and unoriginal, and the sound quality of the CD is the worst I've heard in a long time. The producer of this waste of money needs to go back to the drawing board. Il Divo's heavenly voice deserves better."
5,Il Divo....what can I say?,These guys are awesome. I own every CD they have put out plus the video. Can't get enough of them.
5,lL Divo is the best!,If you like great singing buy this album. Theseguys are the greatest thing to hit the music scene in decades!
5,Absolutely beautiful music,What an incredible way to wind down after a crazy day or get inspired! I just didn't realize that it was in Spanish!
2,"Fifteen minutes, yes. Siempre, no.","Sounds better than freeway traffic noises, but not much. The sad fact is that if Il Divo had never happened, each of these guys had a shot at serious work. But, thanks to the Machiavellian denizen of American Idol, they have become a commodity. Not horrible, but oh so trivial."
2,Il Divo,"It wasn't as good as I thought it would be. I had heard the one song before the purchase, but the rest of the CD did not compare. I regretted my choice."
5,It's transcendent!,"This is the best Il Divo album and it is well worth 10 or even 20 bucks. If you like Isabel and Si Tu Me Amas, this is one album that you must have. Josh Gorban's Awake is good but Siempre is beyond great."
4,it grows on you,"I had high hopes for this follow on album even after reading some reviews that said it fell short of their premier album. I have to agree that it isn't quite as good. I've given it some thought trying to see why. It isn't the performers--they're still wonderful. I think it is the production of the album--the mixing done in the recording studio and the choices of music. You have a piece that starts out wrapping around you in a caressing way and then all of a sudden it explodes into an operatic aria. The arrangements of familiar tunes in a new manner is nice. The album grows on you, but it does have a few moments when you are cruising along smoothly and hit a snag."
3,"Amazon Should State ""CD Not Sung In English""","My sister asked what I would like for Christmas and I requested a Il Divo CD from Amazon.Com. It did not state in was not in english so I was very disappointed. I too, have watched many TV shows with Il Divo singing and they always sang in English so now I wish I had asked for another CD. One I can understand the words too. They are great singers but I wanted a CD I could sing along with. Amazon should state the language of their music. I also wanted their Christmas CDs but would I be able to understand them? Maybe Simon Cowell should be notified."
5,dvd,What voices these men have. First heard parts of this album on Oprah and I was sold on them. Seller and delivery were great. AAA++++++++++++
5,Very Enjoyable CD,"I enjoy listening to this CD and escaping into ""IL DIVO Land"". All 4 ""Il Divo voices"" are beautiful when singing as a group and when singing individually. Especially enjoy their singing in a foreign language."
5,"WOW, and a MUST have","Siempre is a good album, a must have by any true Il Divo fan. Without You and Somewhere make this album for me. I love listening to the raw power in these men's voices. I had the amazing opportunity to see this group in concert. Took my breath away!"
4,Il Divo fan,"I love love love Il Divo, but this album slightly disappoints me! They REALLY need to come up with new material and stop the remakes already!!! Their version of Nights In White Satin is totally exquisite, but lets mix it up with some new exciting things we haven't heard before...and if anyone could do it well it is Il Divo! By seeing the other reviews, they better do it soon or they will lose a huge fan base, and it would break my heart to see them not succeed! I beg of you Il Divo, let's hear something original!!"
5,Beautiful,This is a wonderful listening experience. I've enjoyed all their other CD's and this is no exception.
5,il Divo - Excellent listening - A Real Pleasure,For real listening pleasure - do purchase this CD. A wonderful musical experience and I am definitely on the prowl for more great CD's from this group.Lynne in North Carolina
4,Il Devo,"I purchased this disk along with Paul Potts' ""One Chance."" Of the two, I preferred ""One Chance."""
5,Beautiful,They are a great Tenor group. Songs are done well. There are some well known songs on their CD.
4,Excellent Group!!,"I was introduced to Il Divo a few weeks ago when I saw them on a television segment. I could not believe the voice blend of this group. They are absolutely magnificent! I ordered this Siempre CD and The Christmas Collection CD. My only complaint with the Siempre CD is that they only sing one song in English (Somewhere). It would have been nice to hear 'Without You' and 'Tell That To My Heart' in English too. However, I love their voice blend so much that I try and overlook the fact that I can't understand a word they sing :-)"
2,IL Divo?? More like IL Sucko!,"These guys songs have no originality! For better romance songs in Spanish,try Alejandro Fernandez or Luis Miguel. I think their voices are far moresmoother than IL Divo!"
5,Motivational and a quick read,"This book tells you ""how to"" by stories with specific examples of events, both successful and not so. It is a step-by-step handbook which will easily assist and motivate any fundraiser in any walk of life."
5,My Favorite Lewis Book!,I found this book not only interesting but funny. Lewis knows how to convey serious reflections on human behavior in a humorous way which doesn't reduce their solemn significance. He weaves out of fiction an ultra-insightful analysis of the silly reasons why we are often hell-bent on NOT going to heaven. Recognizing those reasons and concentrating on overcoming some of them changed my life for the better. Über-recommended!!
3,"Entertaining, but don't try and take too much theology from it.","I gave this book three stars because while it is entertaining, there is a significant potential for people to try and get theology from it, which for the most part I don't recommend. The author makes sure to make that point at the end of the book, though. But I'm sure it's too late for a lot of people by then.The primary theological point that C.S. Lewis is actually intending to make is that one goes to hell as a consequence of rejecting God and ""loving"" self. It is the person's rejection of God, not the other way around. However, in trying to make this point in a novel, a lot of the theology seems to get messed up."
5,W.................O.......................W!,"Take your time with this one. Its dynamics, allegory and symbolism--if you catch them-- will illuminate your mind and soul with a sobering and healthy thought-proving self-reflection. It consumed my mind, for sure. What an author....what can one say? I am speechless.Wonderful, spectacular, outstanding and highly recommended.Carrie Lynn JonesAuthor of:It All Began... When Jesus Gave Me Sneakers"
4,The Great Analogy,"With clear moral and spiritual insight, Lewis delves into what keeps man from God. Using a mythical bus trip from Hell to Heaven, he shows what humans have to sacrifice on the way to Heaven. While, some say Lewis is a bit cold in this book, I disagree. Lewis merely shows that even the best virtuals can be twisted into vices. Like men who kill innocents in the name of God, or the stalker who terroizes the one he ""loves"". The major problem is that like the Screwtape Letters it is more piercing than we would like, but just as piercing as we need."
5,Can Anyone Equal Lewis?,"We who still live on Earth will probably never see another C.S. Lewis. The man was in a category all by himself. Most writers live to write ONE great work...Lewis wrote many including the Narnia Chronicles (NOT just for children!), The Screwtape Letters, Mere Christianity and many, many others. The Great Divorce is my second favorite Lewis work, just (barely) behind Till We Have Faces. Lewis introduces the work by citing Blake's concept of the marriage of heaven and hell, then writing about their divorce. Many of the details of the book have been cited by other reviewers, so I will only add that the book is a wonderful, thoughtful portrait of the human condition from the mind of a brilliant thinker. Enjoy."
4,"Don't enjoy Fantasy, but enjoyed this","I'm not ordinarily interested in fantasy, but I liked C.S. Lewis's book The Great Divorce. A great mind and entertaining writer.Virginia Benson"
4,Great Idea...Different Perspective,"This is a wonderful book that uses an ordinary man's dream to show the great separation between Heaven and Hell. It demonstrates that nothing fit for one can be taken into the other and that you MUST ""sell all that you have and follow Me.""I highly recommend."
4,You Can't Have it Both Ways,"Lewis begins The Great Divorce by talking about Blake's The Marriage of Heaven and Hell, a marriage which Lewis finds impossible. Heaven and Hell must be divorced and all of his readers considering one or the other as an ultimate destination must realize that they won't be able to have it both ways. The two places are, by definition, different one from the other. You must embrace the joy that is heaven without reservation and you must renounce absolutely that which partakes of hell. The book itself, of course, is absolutist but it is also suffused with joy. Lewis' method of description/delineation of these alternate destinations is fantasy/allegory. His story moves along briskly and his arguments are sharply etched as they are embodied in spirits and those spirits' dialogues. This is not my favorite book of Lewis' but it is a nice introduction to his ways and his thought. It is also a very quick read."
5,After Darkness... Light.,"The Great Divorce, is with only few exceptions, my favourite book. You take a stroll through hell which seems like a pathetic greek drama, only to find a bus stop destined for a Heaven that will only at first seem like hell, a giant that is George MacDonald, and a whole host of characters a few saints but most sinners. A must read, and one of the few books that I have read other than the bible where it seems as if something divine was actually helping to guide the hand of the writer. I can't wait for the sunrise."
4,Good But Wanted More,"This was a pretty good and deep book. I would have liked Lewis to keep going in his description and be more like a Dante's Divine Comedy. However, you can see why he stops where he does. His characters are well thought of and you can see the great illustrations he gets from his cast of characters. I found myself a bit confused at times with what was going on so this will definately need to get a second reading. Overall I enjoyed the book and Lewis' character and humor shine through even here. Overall grade - B+"
4,thought provoking,"This book show's how horrible sin is. How it ruins people, How it ruins their minds. Read this book and think about yourself. Think about what you are holding onto in life, and ask yourself if its worth it. This book should shed some light on the subject."
4,"Amazing, but difficult read.",Amazing concepts which broadens and challenges one's own beliefs. I would recommend this for anyone who wants to be challenged.
5,Thought-provoking,"I love how Lewis always manages to sneak a point or two past you. With all his religious writings, I find myself turning back a chapter or two saying, ""Oh, so that's what he was getting at!"" Lewis provides an intriguing look at what Heaven and Hell might be like while clearly indicating that it is only an idea. Definitely worth a read."
3,A new way to ponder eternity,"I am not a fantasy fan, much to the chagrin of many, and I still don't ""get"" the magic of the Narnia series (even though I am glad to see it have so much meaning for others). It was with this mindset that i finally picked up The Great Divorce, and I admit to being pleasantly surprised.As some reviewers have pointed out, this probably shouldn't be used as a theology text. What it is is a thought generator and a conversation starter with those who have questions about eternity. And, beyond that, something that can be read--even thoughtfully--in only a couple of hours."
4,A miniature masterpiece,"Some folks only know Beethoven for his 9th symphony. Some folks only know C.S. Lewis for one of his ""greater"" works. (Mere Christianity, The Screwtape Letters, The Chronicles of Narnia etc..) What a loss. Anyone who has read any C.S. Lewis should make the time over the course of their lives to read THIS C.S. Lewis. I loved this book. No writer in the twentieth century ever hit the nail more directly on the head when dealing with human nature than did Clive Staples Lewis. This book is a perfect example of his talent in this area. Not even the Screwtape Letters did it better. I heartily recommend this book to all readers."
1,Glad to divorce this one!,C.S. Lewis is one of the most praised writers in the christian literary world. I am not a fan of this book. I found it extremely hard to follow and all around just a hard read. I ended up having to find a study guide online to make it through the class.
2,"Another boring ""classic"".","Just plain boring, and difficult to read because of that. I just wanted to get it over with. The book just seems to be preaching about all of our human pitfalls. Yeah, no kidding - we see that that every single day on the news and on every so-called reality TV show. I won't be reading any more from this author."
2,Too Much Allegory... Read Love Wins Instead,"I tried to get into this literary classic and just couldn't quite understand it. It came highly recommended to me by a friend of mine because he knew I had just read and enjoyed Rob Bell's, ""Love Wins"". Apparently Lewis and Bell think similarly on issues relating to Heaven, Hell, and the afterlife. But, there was just too much use of allegory and symbolism in ""The Great Divorce"" that I couldn't bring myself to finish it simply for a lack of understanding on my part. If I can't understand a book then I don't see the sense in continuing to read it. And, so I reluctantly stopped reading this one about halfway through. If you have no problem understanding allegory, then I recommend this book. But, if you are like me and find it difficult to understand allegory, then save yourself the time and read Love Wins instead."
4,The Great Divorce,"I really enjoyed this book thinking at the end he had a dream with a very important message...we all have choices, lets make the right one!"
4,An interesting ride,"C.S.Lewis gives us an interesting interpretation of what hell might be like and the reasons why those in hell might wish to stay there instead of leaving for a better existence in heaven. But I guess that is why they ended up in hell in the first place. It certainly was not the hell I had been brought up with, but a hell none the less."
3,interesting approach of heaven and hell,"This is an interesting approach to Heaven and Hell. Instead of being chosen, the characters have to choose whether to stay in Heaven or return to hell by choosing to adhere to their attachement such as pettiness, rigid expectations, or possessive love. I personally did not enjoy this book and had to try hard to finish it and I think it was because I felt his allegory was too simple, sometimes too preachy."
5,Outstanding book.,CS Lewis great theologian or great Christian apologist as some would say was one heck of a writer.The Great Divorce C.S Lewis good as a stand alone story or as a more deeper spiritual book. I continue to be blown away by how good C.S Lewis is one of those authors where sometimes you get the strangest sensation that he is actually speaking directly to you.The Great Divorce serves to remind all of us that while sin does indeed have an eternal penalty the first commandment for all Christians is love.
5,Richly evocative,This is my all time favourite of the books of ErdrichI have read. It has a special poetic feel to it. It is subtle and interesting at the same time. It stayed with me long afterI finished reading it.
4,Entrancing Tale,"My husband had to read this book for a history course on Native Americans several years ago. When his eyes were too tired to read, I often read sections out loud to him. Those small glimpses of the book were intriguing and I have long intended to read it fully.It is the story of a people on the edge of cultural and physical extinction. The characters are so alive and the story, told in first person by two alternative narrators, is vivid, mystical and entrancing."
3,Tracks by Louise Erdrich,"Tracks is an a very good book. It gives you in site of the Native American culture. Pauline was a favorite character of mines because she is crazy and has an imagination of her own. I really love how Fleur was such a mystery throughout this book which captures the reader's attention. Sometimes, the book can be a bit confusing to read, and you may have to re-read some parts to get a better understanding of what is actually taken place during the story line. I think this book is a pretty good book to read, and it is very interesting."
2,short but confusing,"I made two mistakes in reading this book. First, I read it very quickly, and I think that's why I tended to get the relationships of the characters confused. Second, this book is one of a series, and, although its events occur first, it was written later. Therefore, perhaps the author intended for the reader to be already familiar with the characters. The book has alternating narrators. One is Nanapush, a Chippewa elder, who is telling Lulu her mother's story. Lulu's mother is Fleur, the central character in the book, a beguiling woman whose parents died from a white man's disease. The other narrator is Pauline, half-white, vengeful and somewhat crazy, who becomes a nun bent on self-flagellation, perhaps attempting to assuage guilt from having lured Fleur's lover toward a young, beautiful girl. I was somewhat puzzled that Nanapush seemingly so easily forgives a huge betrayal by his lover, Margaret, and I was amused by Fleur's wily act of trickery at the end."
2,2nd order never came,"I did not receive the other book that I also ordered by the same author, Louise Erdrich. I did pay for it on my credit card. It has a long title, something like ""The Last Miracles at ..."" Please let me know when or if it is coming. I really want that book. thanks, Sr. Mary Rogers"
1,"Remote characters, flat style, nothing of interest here",With few exceptions this book was plodding and lifeless. Although I found certain passages (very brief) moving and angered me (in terms of white greed) I found this book failed at dealing with effectively the subject matter it purports to address.
1,Probably should have liked it,"OK, I read this for an English class. Worse yet, I had to write a paper on it. Toughest paper I ever wrote because I could not stay awake. I don't even remember the book that well (4 years). Got to admit though, some of the other folks in my class ranted and raved, as did the other reviews. C'est la vie!"
2,Not my fav....,"I was forced to read this book for my sophomore english class. Let's just say, it's not my favorite book. It started off hard to follow, and then as it progressed, it became more and more difficult to comprehend. There is a lot of old people sex and sexual inuendos. The plot is slow and to be honest, i am really not interested in reading any more books about indians. I'm not racist, just sick of all the indian books! I do think that the book was written well and it was interesting how Erdrich switched narrators. Overall I wouldn't have picked to read this book on my own, but if you like nature stories about the troubles that Indians had to go through, then go ahead read this book."
1,DONT READ FOR YOUR OWN SAKE!!!!!,"we had to read this book for english class, and it is awful. I dont believe i can repeat the things that i think about this book in this forum, but i think you guys get the idea. If you enjoy boring stories about non-relavent things, feel free to bore yourself with this boring novel."
3,Not as good as Expected,"I had to read Love Medicine by Erdrich for my freshman year lit. class in college and loved it - I had never read anything about Indians before (even though I have Indian Heritage) and was captured by it and loved it - I made an A!Years later - I was still thinking about how great Love Medicine was so I picked up Tracks and was expecting another great read... I did not enjoy this near as much - I did manage to finish the book (it got better midway through) but I would skip this read if I had to do it all over again. The stories were fascinating, but it seemed to drag on and on with no real ending. It left me feeling like I had wasted my time and ultimately was unsatisfied. It defiantly didn't quench my literary thirst..."
2,Dark Purple Highlights,Dark purple highlights made book hard to read. Surprised it was shipped to me. Only good thing was arrived before due date.
3,Didn't leave a big impression...,"I have to start by saying that I'm a big fan of Louise Erdrich, especially after reading The Last Report on the Miracles at Little No Horse, which I highly recommend. I should also say that until I picked up Tracks did I know that her characters reappear throughout her novels , which I thought was a wonderful surprise.With that said, I wasn't as taken by Tracks as my expectations had forewarned. Her writing was of course, wonderful but I didn't find the story to be as original or captivating. It was definitely an easier read yet still stands alone on it's own as an interesting story.Overall, if you haven't read anything by Erdrich I recommend you start with one of her earlier books, like Tracks and then move forward."
1,I don't remember this...,"This might be a book that a professor asked me to get, but since I dropped her class, I never read it!"
3,Edited!,This novela is edited but all in all it's ok. I wish ALL novelas would be sold as they were watched on TV - with no editing!!!
3,Great show but the two final discs were unviewable,I really enjoyed this show. The editing was good and the subtitles worked well. But I was horribly disappointed that the last 2 discs with the final episodes did not work at all. My DVD could not read them. This is not the first time that a DVD produced by Televisa contains a disc that is simply unworkable. The quality control is not working so the buyer should be beware and Televisa check your Discs before packaging them.
5,beautiful and colourful show,"I really enjoyed Heridas de Amor. It is very good quality show. because the actors are beautiful, landscapes and interiors are very colourful, and the story is fascinating. I don't speak Spanish, but I love latin telenovellas, and, luckyly, this show has English subtitles. The storyline is very dynamic. It does not reflect a real life, but it is not supposed to be real, it is like fairy tale for grown-ups. I recommend it for people who love and understand the latin culture, who have enjoyed latin telenovellas before and understand the rules of this genre."
5,Great story line,"I've seen this novela on tv so i had to buy it Great actors, great story plot, and beautiful locations in the novela. It's a must see novela"
2,"It's ok, nothing to rave about","I bought this only because Clooney was in it and I wanted to see his early work. He stars as ex-surfing champion Mark Remar, who turns to drug-running after an injury forces him to retire. His girlfriend (Dedee Pfeiffer)accidently gets pregnant with his child and she decides to move to Portland the escape the drug life. He wants to join her, but decides to do one last score. END"
3,An Enjoyable Film That is Highly Underated.,This is a good film thanks to the great acting talent of one George Clooney. Before his ER Days and major movie stardom Clooney played a surfer who suffers a injury turns to the drug running business to make a living. But things get out of hand when his girlfriend decides to leave him and gets himself invovled with a dangerous drug dealer. Most of the film is pretty much formaulic but it's still worthwhile wacthing. When seeing this film it's hard not to notice the acting talent Clooney has and has accumlated since then. A great film to watch if you want to see Clooney's earlier work.
3,Red Surf - Very Good,"I was impressed with young, handsome George Clooney in this movie. The script wasn't bad though it had a weak ending. DeDee Pfieffer was very good."
2,Red Sludge is more like it.,What a piece of work this is. Watching George Clooney run around with long hair and pretend to be a drug runner? Come on... No wonder this movie never recieved a theatrical release.Bad acting lighting and really bad camera work sink this shipwreck. To bad the tides couldn't have washed this film out to sea.
4,A good enjoyable read,"I don't know what all the fuss is about; Jean Rabe has penned a good Harpers book. There are no earth-shattering revelations and your not going to find any truisms here (which is the case with most fantasy novels).The characters are constructed fairly well. The villians are truly the most developed characters. I found myself anticipating what would happen to the villians more than I did the heroes. In fact, if this weren't a Harpers book this could have made a nice starting point for a villians series.To me the story reads like a good translation of a D&D module (unlike ""Against the Giants""). The characters are vibrant and colorful.I enjoyed this book and I most people would also enjoy it."
2,Slow but good refrence,"I have read the book three times. I found that, although it was slow, it did delve into the minds of the Red Wizards and, while not the most captivating book, it can give a Dungeon Master who is running a game in Forgotten Relms some insight into how the Red Wizards think."
2,Forgotten Realms: Red Magic by Jean Rabe,"I like the series of the Forgotten Realms, but this book was for me way too dark; My 2 star rating is therefor not a rating of the author as such, but this particular novel in my very personal evaluation."
1,worst book ever,"I bought two Harper books. The parched sea and this one, after reading the parched sea i expected alot from Red Magic. I couldn't get passed page 76, i read Exile (by R.A Salvatore), the puppet king (Douglas Niles) and Rainbow Six (Tom Clancy) and i couldn't get far in this book. If you see a copy, don't get tempted by the cover art, run!"
1,This book is the height of mediocrity,"It's like Jean Rabe rolled some dice, DM'ed a game, and turned it into a novel.I cannot communicate how incredibly sucky this book is. I had the misfortune to read it way back in 1995 or so when it came out. I was quite the AD&D; fanatic back then, but this book was still crappy. What can I say -- the writing was wooden, the characters were lifted out of the Players Handbook --- need I go on?I agree with the other reviews, Red Magic was like the 4th or 5th book in the Harper series, so some excuses may be made. But Elfshadow was a GOOD book. Well worth reading. I'm amazed that, ten years after I had the misfortune of reading Red Magic, Jean Rabe has chalked up a whole lot of books since then. I only hope her writing has improved in the interim."
5,"Classy, sexy, cute.","The poem is simple but imaginative. It's a tragic tale of sex & scheming in the roaring '20's. Classy, sexy, cute. Spiegelman's illustrations give it new life. A must have!"
5,wild and wonderful,"The wild party is a brilliant poem that pre-empts the beats' sense of rhythm and love for the low-down and dirty elements of modern life. Even though it was written six decades ago, it is fantastically modern. With a pulsuating, driving style that includes violence, humour and excitement, The Wild Party grips the reader from beginning to end. Spielgelman's illustrations, although nice and evocative, do not match the pure intensity of the writing. Well done to Spielgelman for finding this 'lost classic' and re-publishing it (although on the spine his name gets top billing which seem a little self-centred seeing as the books power lies entirely in the words, not the pictures. Indeed the writing is so bitingly vivid that the pictures are unneeded). I have read this book over a hundred times and it never fails to quicken my pulse and ressurect my love for poetry."
5,The party we all wish we could have been at,"This wonderful narration of one truly wild party sparks the imagination of unforgettable nights. It is written in a style that lends itself to being read aloud, as the dramatic content is high. Art Speigelman's illustrations make this night one book to remember, and add to the collection. This book will remind everyone of the night that they let their hair down and partied like the never had before, only to have to face the consequences."
5,"Great songs, great price","I haven't heard many of these songs in 30+ years, and I was singing along with most of them the first time I listened. There were so many tracks and the price was very good. I highly recommend this CD."
4,Burt Bacharach & Friends - Gold,"This CD is very good, easy listening, reminding me of what I enjoyed hearing in the 1970s. Even people who weren't listening in the 1970s would enjoy it."
3,Bianchi 6 Holster,The holster is made of thin leather and is single stitched with a plastic clip. It has a slim profile.
4,A ROMANTIC FLORAL SCENT,"Designer Jessica McClintock is well known for her classic gowns whether the occasion is a cotillion, debutante ball, quinceanera, or a wedding. If a wedding is planned she offers gowns for everyone from the bride to the smallest flower girl.In addition, she presents hand bags, shoes, veils, headpieces, all perfect accompaniments to the chosen gown. Her hallmark is a very contemporary look with old world touches, such as brocades, laces and silk.As noted many of the occasions for which she designs are romantic ones, and the same word, romance, might also be used to describe her fragrance. With notes of white rose, white jasmine and lemon it reminds one of the refreshing, lovely scent of a bridal bouquet. It is light yet lasting.- Gail Cooke"
2,Nice Phone - doesn't hold up to use...,"My two sons have this phone. The size and camera are great, durability is NOT. On one phone the back button stopped working. On the other phone the center button fell off (just like another review). The T-mobile store says buttons that fall off are not covered under warrantee. We are already buying a different phone at full price to replace the one with the buttons that fell off."
1,IF LOOKING FOR DURABILITY..THIS IS NOT THE PHONE FOR YOU!!,"I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PHONE!!! THE ALARM SUCKS, ITS IMPOSSIBLE TO GET SERVICE ANYWHERE!!BUT WHAT SUCKS MOST OF ALL IS THAT THE BUTTONS FALL OF AND OF COURSE WARRANTY DOES NOT COVER THIS..PART OF THE REASON I PURCHASED THIS PHONE WAS DUE TO HOW SEXY AND STREAMLINED I THOUGHT IT LOOKED COMPARED TO OTHER PHONES AT THE TIME OF PURCHASE..BUT NOW THAT THE BUTTONS FEEL OFF, IM STUCK WITH A PHONE THAT LOOKS LIKE A LIKE CRAP AND FUNCTIONS HORRIBLY. DO NOT INVEST MONEY IN THIS PHONE.."
2,Cute Phone but Slow Response to Commands,"Hi,I upgraded to this phone last fall and I have been disappointed ever since. You have to set the alarm every night and the commands are extremely slow. Ending a call is slow. Typing in a phone number to call is slow. Texting is slow. If you patient then this phone is for you. I paid for this phone and the phone I had previously was free and much better. I suggest going into the Tmobile store and scroll through the features to make sure everything you want is there.I also had to get a replacement phone because the circle which navigates through the menu fell off. The clerk stated that this problem in not uncommon."
4,Great phone but t-mobile has poor customer service,"I had this phone. It worked great for 3 months. Then I dropped it. Be careful because the screen is easily breakable. It did everything I wanted and more. It is perfectly clear, no echos and the speakerphone is pretty loud and clear. I like the myfavs feature; it save me a lot of money. The one thing that is horrible is customer service throught T-mobile. If you want to get this phone go through another cell phone provider. T-mobile will not give me customer service at all because I bought this phone from the internet. The insurance claim is taking way too long almost a month. I really miss this phone. The camera is clear and the video is really good. It comes with a usb cable to upload to your computer. So far I have not be able to get it to work but I think it is because I needed an extra card in the phone? (a memory card?). I really wish I could have this phone with another provider."
2,Doesn't charge!!,"I've had this phone for about 3 months now. It will NOT charge! I have tried many different outlets, but for the past few weeks, the phone won't charge. When it does charge, it doesn't hold a charge. I've heard of others having this problem as well. The phone is also slow. It doesn't go where you want it to go right away. The phone is awesome for a while, but then all of these problems start happening. I wouldn't buy this phone. I am going to pay the price to get a different one. I hate it."
2,Motorola Rizr,"I biught this phone only to realize that right out of the box it had white screen problems, I exchanged it and the same thing happened again. I sent the second phone back for a tmobile shadow and I couldn't be happier. If the white screen is fixed then it could be a decent phone, but it is annoying and frustrating."
5,Leviton Rotary Dimmer,"This is a difficult to find rotary dimmer that is significantly thinner than standard dimmers intended for installation in standard electric switch boxes. It was a perfect fit, however, for a smaller housing on a Stanley china cabinet. And it was an ideal replacement for the obsolete original dimmer that expired."
2,You get what you pay for...,This is properly advertised - the tip is plastic and therefore has a noticeable seam and poor color. If you are not serious about magic then this product may be for you. If you are more serious then I recommend to visit a local magic shop and purchase a rubber tip with great color and seamless for only $5.
4,"Arrived in good condition, very pleased. Interesting game.","My order arrived ahead of the scheduled date and was in very good shape for a used book. There was a little dogearing on the edges, but that's about it. It was packaged very well, too, and was labeled as ""do not bend"" and came in a nice padded envelope - I wasn't expecting that on such a low value item. I would gladly buy books from Scott Holden-Jones, et al, again.I picked up the book for the story, rather than the game materials; however, it looks like it contains everything you need to get a game going, although there might be a game master's edition out there. It looks like it might be based more on GURPS than D&D;."
1,dated information,I quickly scanned this book upon receiving it and saw some information that is badly out of date involving the Isles of Refuge. I was hoping to received a useful reference and this was not so I returned it.
3,PG 15,"Do not use these books to improve the vocab of younger kids, even those who might be taking the SAT for ""talented student"" search programs in 7th grade, unless you are OK with your kids reading in great detail about cute guys sticking their hands ""down the pants"" of girls who ""claim not to be virgins."" I don't think ""virgin"" is an SAT word, but I might be wrong. Apparently, one must write cliched scenes about virgins to intrigue high schoolers? Adults in these ""SAT vocabulary novels"" also ""need a beer"" from time to time. I'm not a prude, but I think the books should disclose their content accurately so I could choose what to present as educational material to my kids.That all being said, the books do use a lot of good vocab words. Playboy might, as well, but I am not having my 12 year old read it."
5,BEST BOOK EVER,This book was awsome it had a great combination of love and drama it so kept me wanting to read more and on top of reading a great book I crammed in some SAT words i would defenetly recomened this book
2,Best mix missing from this release,"The Eurythmics' ""I've Got A Life"" has been #1 on Billboard's Dance/Club chart for 2 weeks as of mid-Dec 2005. The one and only version of this song you should care about is the David Guetta & Joachim Garraud Mix. This is the mix that has made this song a massive hit at dance clubs worldwide. It opens with basically a 90 second acapella of Annie Lennox's vocal, then breaks into a wicked bassline which carries you into the rest of the song. This is a truly amazing mix. Unfortunately, it is not available on this CD single, or any of the others that have been released so far.Why do record labels do this? Why do they release an amazing mix to clubs to promote a record, then put a different set of less stellar mixes on the actual CD releases. Everyone who hears this song out at a club wants a copy of THAT version of the song, not some watered down version. And record companies wonder why CD sales are falling..."
2,hoop earrings,"I gave this product a low rating ONLY because the wire would not stay closed. I did like the earrings just not the fact that the ONE hoop wire would not stay closed. The seller did accept request for complete refund. At this time I am awaiting the refund to be credited. If need be, I will change this review to a higher 'star' rating."
4,"This is a great study guide, but that is it.","The title is of this book is a bit miss leading. This book is a great study guide if you already know the material. If you are having trouble understanding something or are just learning the material this book will NOT help you.Essentially the book gives you the common formulas and a very brief discription.It is still very helpful and well worth 7-10 bucks to help you study before a phyics exam. However, this book will NOT help you in understanding and learning the concepts."
5,Comfortable and Functional:,"This cincher holds up stockings securely with metal garter tabs, and gives a nice all-around squeeze without pinching, unlike some other garter belts I've tried. Great if you're worried about keeping your stockings up comfortably under clothing."
3,It must be me!,"Sorry - I have made probably 1/4 of the recipes here and haven't made anything I would make again (and my wife basically wants me to shelve the book indefinately).Her pasta recipe is interesting, but too watery for my taste (guess that also goes for most of the recipes I tried), and enjoyed her discussion about tomatoes so much that I ordered seeds from the seed companies she recommended.Oh well. Back to Marcella I suppose. Know her books like the back of my hand though. Too bad, was looking for something new and exciting in Italian cooking."
3,Where is a sample recipe?,"Love the ""look inside"" feature of the book. The narrative looks interesting butI choose cookbooks based on how a recipe is written. There were no examples of recipes shown...just one or two in different catagories would be enough to makea purchasing decision. Can't rate the book as I did not purchase it."
2,Just not that great,"This book was recommended to me by an Italian friend when I asked for a cookbook recommendation that could serve as sort of an Italian cuisine bible. Over the last 4 years, every recipe I've tried as seemed to be time consuming to make and slightly disappointing to eat.I'm planning to buy 1 or 2 Biba books to replace this one."
5,You've gotta try this one,"My copy of this book, battered from much use, is one of the best cookbooks I've ever found. Full of wonderful recpies and variations of recipes, anecdotes and information about country cooks and food artisans,a great discussion of foods and pastas, several menu suggestions and a list of sources for hard-to-find items. Everything I've made from this book has been spectacular. I heartily recommend it."
5,BEINE'BEINE',"THIS IS THE BEST AND MOST AUTHENTIC ITALIAN FARE I HAVE YET TO SEE. MY GRANDMOTHER AND MOTHER'S HOMEMADE, PUT ON A PLATE AND THEN TO THE TABLE CUSTOMS ARE IN THIS BOOK. EVERYHTING REVOLVES AROUND THE KITCHEN TABLE IN OUR HOME. GUESTS COME TO EAT AND TO ENJOY THE COMPANY AND COMFORT. I LOVE THIS COOKBOOK AND THE STORIES THAT GO WITH THE SECTIONS. I AM BUYING TWO MORE TO GIVE AS GIFTS AND AM ORDERING THE FIRST ONE BY THIS AUTHOR. YOU WILL NOT BE SORRY IF YOU ORDER THIS.MY WHOLE EASTER DINNER IS COMING STRAIGHT FROM THIS BOOK.A.SCOTTWEST VIRGINIA"
4,Price,"I was ready to spend the $8.95 for this 37 pin d-sub, that is less than 2"" long and weighs, maybe, 1/2 ounce...until I saw the ridiculous shipping this company is gouging people for....$10.98. This could easily be placed in a 45 cent mailer and mailed 1st class. BEWARE folks! Sleazy, greedy companies like L-Com need to be eliminated as one of Amazon's sales partners.......There is just no excuse for price gouging. MC"
3,Pleasurable reading,"It was a pleasure to read this book and worthwhile. However I am a person looking for more of a book that doesn't put it all on the line. She states in the book on pg. 27 that she does not like to write about pest and diseases however she does imparts some useful information for the novice hosta grower, but not nearly enough for an enthusiast. This is a good little book for the half hearted gardener. This is certainly not a book to hold as any type of real reference material."
5,An absolute must for everybody!,It is a fascinating tale of adventures which takes you to great far away countries. I even followed Phileas fogg's progress on the world map to absorb more details about the countries.It is easy to read and I was sorry to reach the end or the book.
4,A Classic,I was a French major in college and read French novels in order to not forget the language. The text is interesting but I only read parts of it when I find myself in a waiting room. It makes waiting rooms less boring.
2,"I'd rate it 4 stars, except for the rotten sound on this VHS","My two-star rating is for this particular VHS version, not for the movie. This is a fun musical comedy with Eleanor Powell, Burt Lahr, Virginia O'Brien, Red Skelton, and the Tommy Dorsey Orchestra at their best. It opens with the band performing ""Hawaiian War Chant,"" featuring spectacular solo playing by trombonist Dorsey, drummer Buddy Rich, and trumpeter Ziggy Ellman. Unfortunately, the sound quality on this VHS is so poor that only about 25 percent of the dialogue is understandable. This is no exaggeration--it's so bad it needs subtitles. The musical numbers are also diminished by the poor sound. I recently saw the movie on Turner Classic Movies (TCM), and the sound was fine. My recommendation: Don't waste money on this VHS version. Wait for it to show again on TCM, or until it's reissued on a quality DVD."
3,Another Fun Programmer,"Ship Ahoy has a silly story and it follows a formula. It has enough star power to make it worth watching. Eleanor Powell has been duped into sending a magnetic mine to Puerto Rico; she thinks she is doing her duty for the United States. On the ship she meets the writer of kid's thriller serial (Red Skelton) and falls in love.The dancing scenes are excellent, as one might expect from an Eleanor Powell movie. There are quite a few musical scenes amid the story since it is about a theatrical troupe traveling out of the country. Skelton has some amusing scenes, such as one where he tries to escape a basement after drinking too much Napoleon Brandy.Look out for a young Frank Sinatra singing with the Tommy Dorsey band."
2,Comic book is not as described,"The item was not described properly. According to them, it had a ""very good"" shape, which is not entirely the case. The comic came with water stains and a lack of flexibility when it comes to open the book and read it. Furthermore, since it got wet, the cover and pages have an awkward shape. Not recommended at all!"
3,Not for the avid Venom fan,"Most of my ""comic experience"" is from the Ultimate series. However, from what I know about the original Venom, this guy doesn't hold a candle to him. To many avid Venom fans, the twist the authors pull here was a disapointment. I found it interesting, but I think, had this been the original story, Venom would not be as popular a villian as he is today. I also feel that the story arcs in prior graphic novels are much more fufilling then this one, and while I enjoy it, it is not my favorite."
2,Bad art and weird story line,"In the ultimate spiderman graphic novels venom stars in a three volume series (volume 7, 11, and 21). There are a lot of negative things about this book. First of all the art. A lot of the characters in this book look realy distorted and Peter Parker looks nothing like how he should look like. Second is the story line. In this versian of Venom's origin Eddie Brock was a long lost friend of Peter parker. The black suit was actually something their Fathers created as a cure for cancer. I like Venom's origin a lot better in the Spiderman 3 movie. There is also a lot of stupid little details in this book that only I would pick up, in the begining Aunt May was talking about Jimi Hendrix and later she was wearing a Led Zepplin shirt. She is way to old to be from the 60's rock generation. Thats just silly! If you are a die hard Venom fan purchase this book but if your not don't waste your money."
1,Venom Reduced,"Okay folks I admit this is a Good Story. Venom is introduced in a less confusing simplified Origin. I like the the idea that Pete and Eddie were friends at one point. Although somewhere in the first or second year of Ultimate Spidey...a Reporter named Eddie Brock is mentioned...Could be a distant realitive but, not likely. Also his death at the end? Why does He have to DI (Yeah I know according to the Ultimate Spider-man game, he didnt but as far as I'm concerned that doesnt apply...). And Venom seems to be reduced to some slobbering idiot (much Like the Goblin...notice a Trend here?) Good Story. Could be Better though."
4,Venom is unleashed,"This book was pretty good, and was actually the reason why I started collecting Ultimate Spider-man comics. It introduced the Ultimate Universe to Eddie Brock, and old friend to Peter. When they learn of a suit that could cure cancer, Peter Parker (Spider-man) accidently put it on. His strength and attitude was increased. He got rid of the costume before it permantly changed him. Eddie Brock figured out that Peter was Spider-man and put the suit on himself. He became Venom, a very crazy, strong, and strange-looking monster. If your looking for a book that has Venom at his best, this is not it. This Venom is very different from the regular Marvel Universe's Venom. This story is basically a shortened version of a story that marvel did in more than 100 or so issues! Its still a good story, plus it has Ultimate Shocker and Ultimate Nick Fury! I hope this helped you in making your decision on getting this book."
4,For Witches...not Wiccans--WHAT!?!,"I have to disagree witch what the woman from Chicago said. She said that all that the wiccan books say is that we rant and rave about chistians and the fires of hell. Although I can't talk about all of the books, but of the books I have read they say that we sould respect all other religions. NOT put them down as she was saying. Anyway, back to the book. I thought most of it was good and it goes hand in hand with the rede. But some doesn't,But-hey nothin' is perfect. Some GREAT healing spells, good recipes. and many good spells. So overall, a good book for both witches and wiccans-even if it says it is for witches and not the Goddess and God aspect of wicca!"
2,"Be careful, workers.","Anyone interested in magick in any form should be careful with this volume. It contains many powerful spells, to be sure, but whenever you practice gray magick (any magick not solely focused on the good of all) you HAVE to consult an oracle such as tarot cards, I Ching, etc. And then whatever the oracle says will be your outcome, make your decision to perform the exercise or not and TAKE RESPONSIBILITY for your actions.Be full willing to take the heat for what you do, because no fooling it comes thrice back to thee."
1,This book is a disaster!,"To any TRUE practitioner of the craft, this book makes great kindling for your fire, but that's about all. The spells in this book are useless to anyone who practices the rede of ""Harm none"". Also I have big problems with anyone who makes statements like ""these spells will be ineffective if you don't use ALL of the herbs listed"". Give me a break! Anyone who practices magick knows that your intent and will is the most effective tools of magick. If you must buy this book, read it with a HUGE grain of salt."
3,Only read it if you have some time to kill.,"As I am a new witch, I am constently looking for sources of great information. I did not find this book very helpfull at all. It has a lot of receipes in it, but unless you have an unlimited supply of dead squirrels lieing around, they are not very realistic. There is a short chapter on candle making which wasn't too bad, but you will probably get more information and ideas from a craft book than from here. Its a good book to flick through but I wouldn't bother buying it."
3,Is that all there is?,I remember the 1st book being very good and thought it was going to be a long series of 3 or 4 books. It took me forever to get the 2nd volume and it appears it is also the final volume. If there are more somewhere please let me know. This book was ok but not as good as the 1st one. In places it seemed like he was in a hurry to get it over with! Overall the book was ok but not totally satisfying. I hope he didn't quit his day job.
4,Excellent fantasy novel,"If you love fantasy, then this is the book for you. Dennis Jones has an amazing way to take you on fantical adventures to different world. He blends magic with polotics and music to create a unique set of characters. Jones even throws in a funny twist. I would recomend you read this book."
2,"Gotham/Alpha DVD is bad, look for the Platinum Disc DVD","If you are a Bowery Boys - East Side Kids fan, you know these low budget dramadies are entertaining. Unfortunately, the DVD issued by Gotham Distributors/Alpha Video is almost unwatchable. A Washed out picture and distorted soundtrack take away from the enjoyment of this movie.HOWEVER, if you can find the PLATINUM DISC CORPORATION DVD, you will enjoy a sharp clear picture with excellent contrast and a crisp clear soundtrack worthy of DVD."
3,BAD PLATINUM DISC!!!!!,"While the Platinum Disc DVD quality is probably better than others for Bowery Blitzkrieg, it is a severly edited print. There is a 5 minute chunk missing from the film about 1/3 of the way through. This basically renders the disc worthless. Platinum lists the orignal running time of 62 minutes, but it is shorter than that. I've seen the missing footage on a 50 movie pack, but there were different scenes edited out on that one. I haven't seen the Alpha disc. This was also an Astor Pictures re-issue. The East Side Kids films desperately need someone to take an interest in putting out decent copies of them."
5,A very worthwhile read for anyone who loves horses.,"This book is a classic piece of work!"" It is not a step-by-step technical manual; there are plenty of them out there (both good and otherwise). This book is more an ""Equine Manual For The Heart."" It is written in a low key manner, is full of common sense and is a very enjoyable read. Other equine books provide a technical description of ""How"" to do something - this book, by way of throughly enjoyable stories, provides the ""Emotional and Mental Perspective"" to use."" I highly recommend it."
5,Every horse person should have this book!,"To get absolutely! If you love and live with horses, this is what you need! This book will make you understand the horse point of view and will broaden your horizons. At the same time, the author focuses on specific problems that we've all been confronted to, from catching an ""uncatchable"" horse to make a young horse go through the water and more. I don't want to reveal anything, just read it... Also, the author has great writing qualities, I didn't put this book down!"
5,wonderfully entertaining,"I purchased this book in 1974 for 4 year old son and 2 year old daughter. It became their favorite book. In 1985 I purchased this book for our 4 year old niece. When I got the book home my son and daughter sat on the couch ""searching"" for GOLDBUG. It was such a wonder picture to see the two of them, then 13 and 11 (repectfully), flipping the pages of this book and screaming ""there he is, I found him"". Every year I give this book as a gift to some small child and every year a parent tells me how very much their child enjoyed that book."
4,Child's book review,The book cover was very worn.. more than expected. Delivery was quick and price was ok.
5,love it,This was my brothers' and my favorite book when we were children. It is still fun to look for Goldbug on every page! I received this book when I was told I would and it was in great condition. Thanks!
5,Beloved Book,"My 17 month old daughter received ""The Best Word Book Ever"" as a gift and immediately loved it. I purchased a couple other Richard Scarry books and ""Cars and Trucks"" has surfaced as the favorite, mainly because she loves searching for the gold bug in every scene. The other Richard Scarry books we own have the worm and bug hiding out here and there, but this is the only one that I've found, so far, that has the ""where's gold bug"" consistenly throughout. She loves it and I know that as she grows, she'll learn to love it for other reasons, including the kooky characters and funny storyline."
5,Cars Book,"My almost 2 year old has worn out this book. He requests it every night. We can read it page by page or just flip around and look for different details. I've been able to use it to look colors, characters, and other details. I've even caught him ""reading it"" all by himself - well honestly, he isn't reading the letters, but he is definitely reading the pictures and focusing on each page."
5,Great Children's Book,This book is a must have for children! My 4 year old son adores this book. The book is very original. Each page has so much to look at and talk about in addition to the main story line. Plus you have to find the goldbug hidden on each page!
5,wonderful details throughout,"This (and all of Richard Scarry's Busytown books) is a big hit in our house with our preschooler. There are tons of details on every page to look at and talk about, and multiple activity threads throughout the entire book (follow the Pig family, follow Dingo Dog, find Goldbug). I think it was overwhelming when our child was younger, but around 2 1/2 I think the book became more interesting, and has remained a big favorite for years."
5,My son is crazy about this book.,I loved it and now my 2 1/2 year old son loves it too. We have a great time looking for Goldbug. The only negative thing I can say is that he wants to read it every night!
5,things that go,Wonderful book. Lots to look at and discuss. My son cannot get enough of this book. It has been his favorite for at least three months so far! We wore out a yard sale copy and bought a new one! It is a great distraction in the car and at restaurants. Excellent at bedtime. Richard Scarry is great.
5,My son's absolute favorite book,"My son (21 months and obsessed with cars and trucks) asks to read his ""cars and trucks book"" every single day. It seems like every time we read it, we find something new. Great for keeping kids engaged, and the photos are excellent."
2,Too busy!,"I purchased this for my two year old grandson. He loves all kinds of cars and trucks but this book is not a favorite. I purchased it because my daughter in law said her [...] daughter loved it. Although he likes the pictures and will call out some of the cars like the alligator car, it doesn't seem to hold his attention. The story doesn't interest him and the cars may be too fanciful. He can identify more with the illustrations that are less fanciful."
2,toddlers will love it,"My daughter loved this book when she was one and two years old. If we still had it, I'm sure that at age 4 she would be begging for me to read it to her daily. I threw it away last year when it was really worn out... I'm talking about she loved this book so much that she drew on every page and then started tearing out the pages and sleeping with them under her pillow.I give this book two stars because I hate it, and I'm the one who gets stuck reading it to her. I can't stand the stupid cars that look like a pickle, etc. This is why I hate Richard Scarry books. He didn't have a lot of great ideas. He just had a great publisher. I remember loving these books when I was a kid, too, but it was really like an addiction. Richard Scarry books are like junk food."
5,Perfect Book For Spending Time Together!,Our son REALLY loves having this book read to him. He loves searching for Goldbug on each page and is so proud of himself when he finds him on his own. I will say this is NOT a quick read. There are many objects that are labeled that you will be reading along with the story itself. This is great if you want to have you child cuddled in for a bit while you share the story together (a bonus for my husband and I). The neighbor's little girls loved this story as well (they is 6 and 8 years old).
5,Better Than A Teddy Bear,"My cousin just had a son, and also has a two year-old daughter, and I was thinking of a gift and immediately thought of this book. My middle child, a son, loved this book so dearly he slept with it every night. No teddy bear for him, just ""Cars and Trucks and Things that Go"", until the cover fell off, and we had to buy a new copy. So beloved and timeless--I'm happy to start passing this on to a new generation."
5,Delightful trip down memory lane,I recall reading this book to my younger sister many years ago.I recently purchased this for a 6 year old. He squealed with delight.It is his favorite R S book.Richard Scarry books are classics - great for young & old.Delightful pictures & so fun to look at!
4,Just like I remember,I had this book when I was little and I am so excited that my son gets to enjoy it as well. We spend time everyday looking for the little goldbug on each page. He loves it.
5,My son's favorite book,My son got this book when he was only 18 months. Now he is three and this is still his favorite book. He has read this book from front to back so many times and yet he wants more.
4,I have bought numerous copies of this book,This was my (now teenager) son's favorite book. I must have read it to him a thousand times. I have bought numerous copies since then and given them are gifts. I'll bet if you ask my son today to name some of the characters in this book - he could still remember them.
5,A book for generations.,When I was a little boy I loved this book and spent hours pooring over it. My mom recently found our copy and now my two year old son is spending hours looking at it and pointing out all the trucks. I love sharing this with him.
5,Timeless!,"My 37 year old daughter loved this book, especially searching for the Goldbugs. I bought a copy for her almost-three year old daughter and she loves it just as much. Makes me happy!"
3,Richard Scarry: Cars and Trucks and Things that Go,"This is a great book for kids. It was my son's favourite and I bought it for his child. It is a book that a child can spend hours with, however the paper and the binding of the book are quite inferior and low quality. It certainly does not have the sturdiness of the older books. Content is great though."
5,Goldbug is the Best!,"My 18 month old is fascinated by trucks, which is why we bought the book. Now, he loves finding goldbug on each page. He's memorized every single page and can find the little bugger often before my husband and I. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!"
5,Just as my husband remembered it!,"This was my husband's favorite book when he was young, so of course we had to purchase it for our boys. It came in great condition and the delivery was speedy too!"
5,Probably the best Richard Scarry book ever for little boys,"This was my favorite Richard Scarry book when I was young, and I still love it today. It is so creatively done and has so many engaging illustrations."
4,Child's Book for Any Generation,My son (born in 1977) loved looking for Goldbug in this book when he was a toddler. I purchased this book (same edition) for him to pass on to his two-year-old nephew. I want to see if he remembers the book.
4,For the Beginner,"There are many introductory works that survey Buddhist beliefs and history, just like this one (and I've reviewed a number of them), so content-wise this one is not unique. Its explanations are concise and aimed clearly at the general reader, which will make some of it seem a bit simplistic to a more knowledgeable person. What makes it stand out, however, is that, of all the introductions, this one makes one of the nicest to give as a gift to someone curious about your own interest in Buddhism. The text is not over-whelming and is broken up by nearly seventy black and white illustrations of Buddhist art and life, making it a non-threatening read. While it may not be the best introduction, it may be one of the better for other practical needs."
5,Brass cleaning rod,"Much better than the cheap kind. Fit and finish is very good. Wish it were longer, but all & all a good deal."
2,Not satisfied.,"The handle on this cleaning rod is free-floating. I'd rather it be fixed to the actual rod, it would make it easier to rotate a cloth patch down a barrel. The best way to describe this item is ""Meh."""
4,Boy Talk,"This Is The Perfect Cd To Discover All The Deep Dark Secrets Of Your Fav Guy, It's Filled With Helpfull Info From Beginig To End."
3,boring,I love BSB but this cd does not do them justice. It just tells a bunch of facts that most fans would already know. I don't recommend buying it unless you are collecting all the inverviews.
2,Over Promise-Under Deliver,"This unit is well designed and easy to use. There is only one problem - it just doesn't work; the reception is a major issue. Unless you are in a dense urban market, where there is an overabundance of satellite signal presence, you will be dissapointed with this product. In addition, you would think that for $350, XM could include a retractable antenna, rather than the cumbersome and unsightly clip on antenna. This is a prime example of a product that had great opportunity but failed to deliver on its most basic value proposition --portability."
1,It's Great!! If/when it works.,"It has been less than nine months since I have been using my Delphi. I am now on my third unit. The first two units just completely stopped working for no apparent reason.After the 2nd time, Delphi tried to tell me it was installed wrong and that was the issue. Then how has it been working at all? I am now having it replaced yet again.Based on this experience, I plan to resell my new radio and purchase a Pioneer."
5,Dephi XM Radio 2 Go,"I love this item. It is portable, convenient and easy to use.I can put in on my hip and use it while I walk, or put it in my car and use it in my travels. The convenient FM transmitter is great. I recommend it to all walkman/ipod lovers - it's a great addition to your collection of toys."
2,"Not Truly ""Mobile"" just yet.","I thought this would be the ultimate Radio finally they have a portable version. I thought wrong, sure its portable it will go from the car into the house using the home dock and Antenna (if placed in a window) it works just fine. If you where planning to purchase this item to listen to at the gym or on a walk ""outside"" even the mobile antenna (included) and not internal as it should be will fade in and out. Sometimes if you are standing in place pointing the antenna at the sun while hold your leg just right you may get a good signal for as long as you can hold that position. Don't believe the hype the MyFi is still not truly mobile yet."
2,Poor reception,"I returned mine after one day of use. If you intend to use the MyFi as a portable satellite radio receiver (as opposed to listening to recorded content) while you walk/run around your neighborhood, you can expect very poor reception (i.e., more than 50% drop-outs). It was very frustrating and the external antenna had no perceivable effect.I live in a suburb of a major city (Boston), by the way."
1,Way too fragile!,"I bought this radio as a gift for my boyfriend. We were very excited once we got it activated. That same day, we were using it in the car when it fell off the seat and onto the rubber floormat inches below.The display cracked, and now I have to go through the hassle of returning the product for (hopefully a full) refund.For a product that's supposed to be ""portable"", I don't understand how it could be so fragile.For those of you who've already bought one, be careful not to drop it!"
4,Great product - but its HUGE,"I was very impressed by this unitThe XM stations come in very clearly and the controls, for the most part, are pretty easy to useThe LCD is also pretty nice and clear ----- and most importantly, its real easy to hook it up into any sound source, through the headphone jackHowever, this thing is HUGE --- do not buy this with the intent of exercising or jogging with it --- you're better off with an iPod Shuffle for those purposesand of course, the price is up there ---- I'm tempted to wait for the next version, that's hopefully, smaller ----- however, it is a pretty good unit, so if you need an XM unit right now, and portability is a factor, then look no further"
4,"Great Product, Buy aftermarket earphones.",The XM to go is a great product the little radio will let you go from home to car without missing any music. A few problems exist.The headphones that come with the unit are junk. Go buy some aftermarket ones.The five hours of recording is great but I wish that you could edit out the songs that you don't want.The unit sometimes loses its brain. Shutting the unit off has always restored the unit.The music service is worth paying for.
2,Growing pains,"Like much new technology, when it works, it's a dream, but there are also frustrations. The portable xm radio encounters dead spots in which it can't receive signals from the satellite. This doesn't happen with my car xm radio, but it happens frequently with my xm portable. Short of wearing a car antennae atop my head, I'm not sure what the solution is."
1,"Rushed to market, horrible product unworthy as a doorstop","My unit was returned immediately, the MiFi is absolutely horrible. This unit was advertised as a ""walkman-like"" device (for use jogging, backyard, in open areas, etc.), nothing could be further from the truth. The MiFi is plagued with the most horrific reception one can possibly imagine, even with a clear view of the sky. Circuit City review board is jammed with comments on this unit to the effect that over half are not only disgusted with sound and very poor reception but burned the rubber on their tires to return the unit to the retail for full refund.Quite honestly, it has been a very long time indeed since I've owned such a poor electronic device. This product was quickly rushed to market, the most profane aspect of the MiFi is that its central function is billed as a walkman-like device, but it does NOT work as such a device, even with external antennas connected. If you buy this unit, I absolutely promise you will regret it."
1,angry,this item is horrible. it gets no reception. its not portable and doesn't work in my car. also you can't return it to amazon! they say it can.t be returned because it is hazardous - how come they areable to stock and ship it then if it is hazardous. they say to return it to delphi but delphi says they don't take returns. now i guess i'm stuck with it.
1,Spotty Reception in Urban Settings,"1. Cannot get reliable reception from my apartment.2. Spotty service outdoors. Just very annoying when signal comes in and out.3. The product is a little too big to use for running, I'm going back to using my SONY armband radio."
1,This product is to experimental to be sold,"I thought this product would be a great device to add to my daily 4 mile walk. Was I wrong; reception was terrible. I spent most of my time aiming the antenna all over the place, trying to keep it working. The way it was advertised I believed it would truly be portable. It is heavy and awkward with all the wires hanging all over. A company should perfect a product before they release it for sale. We have an XM radio in our SUV and it works on our road. We also get XM online service and its reception is flawless. But this product isn't worth the packaging its wrapped in."
2,Not Reliable Connection in Auto,"I only use in my auto. I've had it for ten months and, since inception, it would intermittantly lose its connection. Now it's always searching for the antennae. Spend a little more $$ and purchase or upgrade the receiver."
1,Beware battery is defective,Battery comes defective and you have to register the unit to get a replacment. Since 12/25/05 I still have not received the replacement battery. So much for being portable....No body cares - xm - not amazon....
1,Dont Waste Your Time... Fix the battery!,"Purchased this from circuit city, went to activate the radio and found out they all had defective batteries in them. What company does not recall the boxes; replace the batteries and ship the products back out? Show them this is unacceptable and do not purchase this product! You have been warned."
4,Good idea - poor reception at times,"I replaced a SkiFi2 with the MyFi for use on a motorcycle. The internal battery of the MyFi removed the need for powering the unit from the bike, which was causing a loud buzz in the speakers at high rpms.I like the layout of the unit, but agree with others that receiption is poor (perhaps it's just in my area) when it's not in the cradle. Standing outside my home, I used the lapel antenna and unless I was facing just the right direction - and not more than a few degrees off of it - the reception was lost.The vehicle and home antennas seem to be working adequately, though it looks as though the unit may be causing some interference with my GPS that sits about a foot away on the dash of the motorcycle.I gave it 4 stars for the layout and usability, but lacking in reception at times. Overall, it seems to be quite good."
1,DON'T BUY THIS ONE!,"Bought this and had antenna & cradle hard-wire installed for my husband's birthday Nov. 30, 2005. IT'S AWFUL!!! A great idea that doesn't really work well, and tech support is unavailable! Not really a portable (see earlier reviews about standing on one leg & pointing toward the sun), hard to see & use buttons, non-intuitive and BTW: worked for one day & then ""lost"" installation signal! When I called support, I was told ""they have no tech people"", and the people who answer their phones are (maybe) familiar with the service but not the radio! A product produced before it's time. I am fairly ""techie"", (have been working on computers for 40 years), and this is one of the MOST FRUSTRATING pieces of equipment I have ever seen! I am now waiting for XM to hear back from their tech people, who will supposedly contact them in a ""day or two""!I hear good things about the Roady - try that instead - I wish I had!"
5,Great While on the Go,I have been sold on Satellite Radio from the beginning and recently purchased the portable MyFi to catch my favorite baseball teams while on the road. I'm a public transit commuter and will listen to a prerecorded program while commuting on the train and baseball games at all other times! It's great - a much better value than satellite tv (which I don't have) with much of the same content. The unit is easy to use and carry fits in my coat pocket. I highly recommend it.
2,Great until it breaks down,"Like a couple other reviews, I loved mine until it broke. Returned it under warranty and the second one lasted also only about 13 months and dark screen after a few minutes of play time (with a new battery). I'll try an Pioneer Airwave seems that it is compatible with the Lancing docking station which I already own and has great sound. Save your money."
5,Great unit,"I use radio in 2 different cars and at work. I have the car adapter and antenna installed in one car. In the other car I use the unit's internal antenna, set the XM reciever in a cup holder, and broadcast the signal to the car radio. It works great either way. I also use the home kit at my desk at work. My office is block construction and I am nowhere near a window, but I still get a strong signal. I would higly recommend the Delphi XM2GO to anyone interested in a highly versatile XM receiver that can literally be used anywhere."
3,works and fails,this receiver worked great until the thumbwheel selector failed to select. it was sent back to delphi to be repaired or replaced. the thumbwheel is very vulnerable to even short falls. it protrudes beyond the protective cover and is the first part of the unit that strikes a hard object...it then fails. unit worked great when it worked. i am hoping that delphi customer service quickly resolves the problem
5,Great Product for Travel,"I have owned one of these for five years now and love it. I use it at home, on the road and when travelling. It even works as far south as southern Mexico and perhaps beyond. Proper antenna pointing at home and car installation are important and of course a view of the southern sky if outside urban areas with local transmitters. The range of stations is perfect - all the news channels, tons of music choices and the sports choice is almost universal - MLB, NBA, NHL, College and even the NFL if you spring for the ""Best of Sirus"" option. If you travel and want to stay in the loop it is the best option."
1,"Delphi, XM2GO","The instructions say you must face the antenna south, that would be impossible in my apartment, no window faces south, I guess that is the direction the satellite is.Best I could do was face east, did not work at all, went up to window facing east and did get some spotty reception, all and all this is not a workable product, not because it is poorly made or anything like that, just that its very nature makes it for myself or too many other people not viable product."
4,Portable XM Radio,The unit is very nicely designed with all of the controls conveniently located and easy to use. Orientation of the antenna is critical for good performance. I found reception much better when used with the external antenna (included). Sound is great and a great selection of music.Delivery and price were excellent. I will check Amazon before finalizing any future purchases.
4,Good portability,I like the portability and you can record your favorite music and use like an mp3 player? Overall a good receiver
1,Lemon!,"I thought the notion of a portable was wonderful. I'm very sorry I purchased this particular unit. It never after the first week worked off the cradle (bad battery? On a new unit?). The unit keypad stopped working completely after a couple of weeks. In order to use this ""portable"", I have to have it cradled and use the remote--otherwise, I cannot use it away from home.I'm frustrated enough to buy a new (different brand) unit, but first I'll make an attempt to get Delphi to stand by their product and replace it. Here's hoping the second one works right."
5,Great,I own 3 XM radios and 2 Sirius radios. This is my absolute favorite. I have no reception problems. I highly recommend this radio over Sirius's portable and XM's new portable (but only because of price). You get a lot of radio for the price.
3,Not a bad item,"I'm enjoying my new XM radio. The only thing I don't like about it, is that it doens't sound that loud in my car. Also, I can't use it in my apt. My home doesn't face the correct direction to get satelitte recption. That's very disapointing because I'm not getting as much use of it as I should. I also can't figure out how to get back to the channels you select to your preselect channels. That should be simple and understandable, but I guess I'll have to get out the instruction manual and read it."
5,Stop whining,"I LOVE MY NEW TOY.....based on earlier reviews I was expecting the worst but that's not the case...stop whining about bad signal/reception ..USE THE RECORD OPTION (5 Hours!!) WHEN YOU""RE OUT AND ABOUT.....DUH.....Still well worth it!!!"
5,Love My MyFi,"I live in the Colorado Rocky Mountains at an elevation of 10,200 ft. and get absolutely NO radio reception in my house. During a year-long illness where I was away from home and received radio reception, I started listening to talk radio and become totally hooked! While browsing one day I found the Delphi MYFi XM2GO on Amazon and ordered it. I received the radio in 2 days and fell in love immediately. I recently listened to it on a 12-hour road trip and it worked great. I truly believe this radio is the best buy on the market right now. My son purchased one and took it skiing the next day and was also totally impressed. The versatility is amazing and I listen to it almost round the clock. A truly great buy! gmapam"
4,Great XM receiver,"I like that it's a little bigger, harder to loose or forget. The best part is being able to see the channel, artist and song all on the same screen. Only bad part, is I don't have time to figure out all that it can do, which is alot! Good thing about it is, you can just hook up the headphones and portable reciever and go jogging with it."
5,Go Go,What a fantastic product! It is easy to use and the technical support is great. It works fantastic as a portable system for the home. My husband now enjoys the Atlantic Braves baseball games. I listen to a classical music station. I like the fact this small system takes up hardly any room and is a snap to use.
1,Your body shields (blocks) the signal!,"Confirmed by XM tech support - I used my Christmas present while fishing - can you imagine the signal cutting off every time you turn for bait or to cast? Impossible! I cancelled my service and will return the MyFi tomorrow (my wife got it for me at Best Buy).The idea of portable was lost with this unit - if you want to have radio when you fish, walk, jog or anything involving movement outside, the MyFi won't do it for you!For the cost and service, I'll put up with commercials on FM radio."
2,I wish I can give it a good rating,"XM2go is a great concept but it is flawed by quality issues and design nuances.Unable to delete one song at a time. Where did they go wrong with that?Poor disk management. After 5 hours it writes over the 1st song in queue. So keep an eye on your recording time.Unable to cycle through channels with a pushbutton on front like the older XM unit I had. You must use the thumbwheel.It locks up and audio drops out. I think I have a lemon because it froze and I had to remove the battery to get it to ""work"" again. This happened numerous times and my anger was getting intense as I am listening to a ""recorded"" song and the unit freezesOverall...Dissatisfaction! Avoid this one and wait for better."
2,Portable XM radio,"There are WAY too many accessories, cords, attachments for this device. When using it out in the open, I have reception problems even when I am in a totally clear space. I have also had trouble locating headphones with the antenna built in that fit it. I do use it sucessfully in the car - but there is a base, and the unit, and the antenna and the cord to plug it into the car lighter - just way too many cords. Same thing for in the house, and even though there is a ""bigger"" antenna - I have tried positioning it in EVERY window in my house and have been unable to obtain a signal anywhere. It's a good idea, but I don't think the technology for receiving the signal is at the level it needs to be in order for it to be a true portable device."
2,"Great Product, Bad Service","I have had a MyFi every since it first came out. It's a great product. It has the ability to record up to five hours of programming.My only major problem is that XM has increased their commercial time little by little every month. Now on most stations, there are 4 or more commercials per hour. This is unacceptable for a subscription based radio service that advertises itself as having the most commercial-free stations.Sirius does not have as many commercials. Go with a Sirius product such as the S50."
2,Bad Battery,I got my Dlphi MyFi for a Christmas present. I signed up for a one-year subscription. After I signed up I was told not to use the battery that came with the radio because it might explode! That defeats the purpose of the radio for me. I want to use it when I am on my bicycle or motorcycle. For that I need the battery! It's been almost a month and I am still waiting on a replacement battery. The satellite radio works fine but I need a battery! I feel like I have wasted a month of my subscription. So far Dlphi has been unresponsive.
3,Good and Bad,"Not all that portable unless you use the record feature.Some stations dont really have CD quality, like the boneyard 41 I think is supposed to sound like an old cassette tape to match the music but it really is a bad idea. Works great with home kit/antenna provided, and par with car kit provided.But walking or jogging and receiving a live signal isnt in the cards."
2,2nd MyFi down,"The second MyFi has lost its number-pad so that only the scroll can be used to dial the stations. The thing is heavy, chunky, fragile and when you record (two segments only can be programmed), playback is limited to the beginning of each segment as XM buys it, so you can't go half-way into an hour-long show if you leave it, but have to listen to the whole thing again. Insult to injury is the dust that blows into the screen, so forevermore the sun on your screen reveals the build-up. This is a second-rate piece of junk compared to iPod-like devices, not a hint of elegance about it."
5,Works for me!,"I just got my Delphi MyFi and for my needs it is flawless. I bought mine for riding my motorcycle in San Antonio so I use it with the magnetic antennae and I havn't lost signal once! I have read many negative reviews, mostly saying that it is ""not a portable"" or that the user ""can't get reception"". I have got to think that these people live in more rural ares without repeaters because my signal is strong and is NEVER dropped while I'm riding. The sound quality is not the greatest, but I assume this can be fixed with a higher quality headphone set. I have not used this unit in a rural setting (although all of my use is on the outskirts of San Antonio which isn't exactly New York City), so I can't comment on the reception outside of a major city. It is very likely that the quality of reception would suffer without the ground repeaters. I also don't play the unit through another radio so I can't comment on that either.For the price this unit CAN'T BE BEAT."
4,Never Listen To Local Radio Again.,"I became an XM Satellite Radio subscriber in December 2003. I almost never listen to local radio since getting XM. I have both the SkyFi and this portable XM, the MyFi. The SkyFi is in my car and is almost perfect. The Myfi is great too. My only negative comment regarding the Myfi is the inability to really use it indoors for live shows. But I can record 5 hours worth of programming on it, so long flights or trips go really fast. I just recorded 5-hours of '70's music for an upcoming flight from St. Louis to Las Vegas, and that will certainly keep me entertained on the trip. The audio quality is top notch. XM has exclusive programming like major league baseball. I sat on the beach last summer in Hilton Head and listened to games from Chicago & New York. The audio was perfect. I would recommend new buyers get the Skyfi first, along with a boom box for indoor use. The Myfi would be a great second satellite radio."
4,Love this thing...,"I live at Grand Canyon where we have TWO radio stations. I had been watching this unit and when Amazon put it on sale, I went for it. I have been delighted. The reception using headphones alone is not that good, but in the car, home or office its great. I recently purchased a second car and home kit for the unit so now all I do is move the unit. Battery life is right at 4 hours, not quite the 5 hours claimed by the manufacturer."
4,"Great product, but can't wait for 2nd generation","This thing finally makes XM worthwhile, usable, lovable, listenable, and so on and so on.... As everyone says, it's not totally/truly portable just yet. But the 5 hours of recording time to me more than make up for this....The only thing I want to see in the next generation is the ability to selectively delete songs and permanently save others... As it is now, it just continuously records from where you left off. So when the 5 hour limit is reached, the first songs start to fall off ....in any case, I LOVE IT!"
2,Disappointing,"I used it for a day and ended up returning it. The radio itself was fine and fairly easy to use (although not something you strap on your waist while working out). The music selection is awesome....WHEN YOU CAN GET A SIGNAL. I wanted to use it while running or walking outside but 90% of the time the signal would drop. I considered keeping it for the ""recording"" feature, but I figured I could use my ipod for that and not have to spend any extra on a monthly subscription fee."
1,Big Mistake,I was amazed at the low price I paid for the Delphi XM radio. Glad I did not pay more as it only worked for a little over a month!!!!
4,Satisified all my expectations,"Purchased the Delphi MyFi XM2GO to be used mostly in the home. However, we have used it occassionally in the car. In the home, it is great. No problems with installation or reception. In the car it is a little different. The installation was easy but the reception is not always good. It seems to depend where we are. But we are very satisfied!"
1,Useless product,"I just bought this product today and after charging it it only took me about an hour to decide i would be returning it. The reception is abolutely terrible. I would much rather listen to an FM radio because at leat that way I can get constant reception. I live in a fairly populated area and would expect reception to be decent at best. This is the first satelite radio I have owned so I cannot comment on how well it works compared to others. I have also not tried it in my car yet. If you are planning on carrying this with you when you walk around, you must have music recorded. You cannot listen to it live even with the portable antenna cliped to your shirt. I was extremely disapointed with this product and would strongly recomend for people to wait until they get reception issues cleared up a little better. It is a real shame that this product had so much potential and turned out to be such a flop!!"
5,Beware of fake offers!,"Don't get sucked in by the ""get it free"" scams in the fake reviews posted here. Spammers are just harvesting email addresses for their ridiculous products.Think about it for a moment. How can somebody afford to give away expensive gadgets just for signing up for some trial offers? Answer: they can't!The San Francisco Chronicle confirms says these offers are bogus. Search sfgate.com or Google for ""David Lazarus Free iPod not really"" and you'll see what the jokers running these programs are really doing."
1,Not worth the money,"I bought this thinking I could use it for different activities, but it turned out to be a waste. It really doesn't work when outside unless the antenna is on and you are in one place. It hardly works in the house and car reception is iffy. I have gotten much better service with the Roady than with this and the Roady cost a lot less."
1,Good radio/ awfull sevice,"This is probably a good radio, but the programming of XM is awfull. I should have done my homework better. Probably fine for air-headed jocks, but not for the intellectual. Their blues chanel is nothing compaired to Sirius'. So now im stuck with a $300 radio and nothing to listen to."
2,Zak's ok,"A good effort, but without John's driving bass the Who is just average.Now Zak is very good[Ringo's son] but some of the classics are a real miss without John's magic fingers. Losing Keith was bad enough,but if they can't find a bassist that can re-produce at least some of the Entwhistle's magic please don't tour or make these DVD's. As a fan who saw them live in the past it is just a cash grab."
2,THE SAME SONGS AGAIN!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?,"Come on Pete, how many times can you recycle this crap. (OK, crap is not a good term since these ARE great songs, but how many times can you try to make a buck off them!?!?) GIVE US SOMETHING NEW or find some other WHO stuff to play. 99% of these are already on the the video from four years ago, which is superior as Entwistle is playing bass on that one. I love the WHO but enuff is enuff!"
3,Two are better than None!,Well the two boys are still giving it their all and the sound and production of this DVD are excellent. It's not the same crew but we just need to be open to what is available...and it's damn good.
3,16x9 or 4x3? WHO knows?,"I bought this DVD thinking that it was a widescreen 16x9 format, like the packaging said. It was a poorly cropped PAN & SCAN. I'm leary about buying another copy and getting another chopped up version. The audio is outstanding, the performance quite good. Sort of a novelty without John. But all in all it was pretty good.Dr. Jimmy"
4,The Who Rocks Again,"I finally got my new DVD player over the weekend and this 2002 show from Boston was the test drive.I saw the Who (finally) in '02 at Hersheypark, and it was a fantastic show. This performance was the exact same set, so I got a close up look at what I didn't see from the back of the arena!Daltrey seemed to labor little bit at times, but this was near the end of the tour and pushing 60, I dare anyone to try and do what he did...also he said in the bonus section that he couldn't hear much due to the PA being overridden. I can understand that.Townshend's guitar work was nothing short of spectacular. Enough said.The backing band was solid, Pino Palladino filling in nicely (though Entwistle can never be replaced); Zak Starkey, John Bundrick and Simon Townshend all did great.A good document of what now appears to be a pivotal time for the Who, as they consider new material. Can't wait."
3,"Decent, but definitely not great.","When I received this mat, it seems like it had been kept in a dirty spot in Amazon's warehouse, so it is a bit stained, even after washing it off. Fiskars really should have wrapped this product in plastic. The sticker label on this item was near impossible to remove. I had to break out the Goo-Gone and putty knife and work at it for a long time before I was able to get it off. I'm also a bit disappointed in the thickness of the mat. I was expecting it to be thicker since it is such a large size (which would help make it less flimsy). The odor that the other reviewer spoke of is also present in mine. It's a pretty strong rubbery smell, so I wouldn't suggest keeping this in your bedrooom if that's where you work. Aside from that, though, it gets the job done. If you need a cutting mat, this one is big and great for large workspaces."
3,Maybe if it cost $9.99 ...,"I like the very large size, and I like having the ability to fold the mat, but to do it over again I would not purchase this item.First of all it stains very easily and gets marked up more than I would have expected. Secondly, the mat has an odd odor about it (from the time I first received it) that I have not been able to wash out.The stress point, where it folds, appears to be separating allowing the opportunity for food matter to get stuck in the area.If it weren't so large and heavy I would have returned this mat. I expected more quality from a Fiskars item."
5,help,ok so can somebody tell me exactly what come with this??? like the dvd and the cd?? or what?? i wanna buy this really bad but i dont know what it exactly includes someone please tell me now
5,superb,This is one of the first Ellery Queen's books that I read. Before I used to read books by 'Agatha Christie'. Being introduced to EQ character and his method of deduction for the first time had me hungry for more. As with the other reviews regarding this book I agree with them totally. The grand finale is mind boggleling.
3,ELLERY IS BETTER ON TV,"It is my habit to read a ""mystery"" series from first published to last. Poirot, Lord Peter, Oliver Thorn, Albert Campion, Travis McGee, Doc Ford, Elvis Cole, Kinsey Milhone and, of course Sherlock Holmes -- all read from beginning to end. I am currently in the Ellery Queen series and am finding it a very difficult read. The Greek Coffin Mystery (of those that I have read) is the most difficult."
2,"Condition not as offered, even thoufh minimally acceptable.","Excellent period mystery [early 1930s]. Poor overall condition of book -- small type, yellowed pages, poor paper quality, plenty signs of use -- even though complete. Next time I'll go with new or excellent."
1,Absolutely H-O-R-R-I-B-L-E,"this movie seriously doesn't even deserve ONE star, but i don't think i could have written the review had i not marked it. i can't even believe i'm sitting here after wasting, what... an hour and a half, two hours of my time??? i guess i'm just running off of pure adrenaline... i am BEYOND irritated with myself that i didn't turn the movie off within the first five minutes like i thought to do. curiosity just got the best of me i suppose... i kept thinking that something of informative value was going to come up at some point, but no... NOTHING.every single thing about this movie was just AWFUL. i could go on and on, but honestly, i've already wasted enough of my time.DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME. seriously... go watch paint dry... i assure you you'll have more fun."
1,A Real Tragedy,"I have studied Jeffrey Dahmer since I was fifteen years old, I am now almost 30. I remember getting ready for school one morning and seeing the developing story on the news. I was instantly fascinated, to say the least. I would consider myself an expert on Jeffrey Dahmer's crimes and his life, so I had to give this film a chance, out of curiosity's sake.I can't tell you how the movie is, because I didn't make it through the first two minutes. The opening sequence of the movie is so horrible that I just knew it would be a complete waste of my time if I continued to watch such garbage. The hokey music that plays over his trial is corny and makes it almost comical, then they show the scene where he kills his first victim, which is also corny and phony.From what I saw, this movie is a joke."
4,A good addition to the collection.,This shows the difficulty of recognising signs of a disturbed mind without the benefit of hindsight. So much easier after the event to piece the bits together than at the time to accept that what you are noticing is the truth.
2,Weird movie,"Weird movie, weird camera work, weird acting, weird choice of actors. The acting constantly swung back and forth between almost pretty good to downright awful, with no in between. Very low budget. Like $10 budget lol!! It have a few interesting moments. But very, very few. Watch at your own risk."
3,Only because I'm fascinated by Dahmer,"I think Dahmer and Manson were brilliant people, and thats the only reason it got 3 stars. The movie was extremely boring and was uninformative. I half wish I could have rented this movie before I bought it. The acting was poor, and poorly casted. None the less I am glad I have the movie now because it is about Dahmer..."
1,Not worth my time,"Do not waste your time. This was very VERY lame. I do not believe that is how Lionel and Shari were...at all. They made him seem so naive to what his son was doing. If he really was that naive, he should be classified as mildly retarded."
5,Durable,"I have used this ball bag daily in our indoor baseball facility, as well as a ball bag for our games. I have had the bag for over a year and it has held up to an enormous amount of use. Quality bag and a good value."
3,Varney's Midwifery study guide,"In studying for the CNM certification exam, I found this book to be extremely confounding. And (in defense of the book) it does state that it is an aid to studying Varney's Midwifery textbook rather than a study prep book for the certification exam. The questions were not based on multiple sources for determining question answers like the purple ""Women's Health Nurse Practitioner"" Certification Study Guide. The only source for the answers in this book are Varney's Midwifery. So, it wasn't really my best source of study questions for the certification exam."
3,Needs to be updated,"Although I appreciate the workbook and its focus on reinforcing the information found in Varney's textbook, I feel the workbook is not helpful if you have the fourth edition of Varney's text. I tried to use the workbook as chapter guides to focus on what I was studying in the text and because the workbook is geared to the third edition text, I found all the page and chapter refernces were waaay off. So if I am studying Varney's fourth edition text on, say, breast exams, then the workbook with the same chapter is reviewing drugs used preconception that could harm the embryo. Very frustrating! I hope for a newer edition with each text revised so I can get a better workbook. Otherwise, it is a great idea to have a workbook companion like William's Obstetrics does."
4,Best Way to get through the textbook,I found this guide extremely helpful in getting through Varney's Midwifery textbook. Without it I had a difficult time willing myself to read Varney's.
5,Cardcaptors is excellent!,"Words just don't do justice to how great this series is. I have watched tons of japanese animation and read scores of manga and of them all this show is my favorite. Now lest you say, ""This guy clearly only likes kiddie anime."" I have to say that I watch everything from Blood to Eva. This still is my favorite! It's just an amazing show. If you like anime you should at least give it a try."
4,Blue Mntn Arts Review,"When I received this book, it was in good condition.... although it had some type of stickers on the outside of the cover of the book that I could not get off (and I was giving this away as a gift)... I am a published author (see page 33 of this book, my poem was published inside of it) of poetry and greeting cards, and since this book is out of print I have to buy them used to give away as gifts to friends and family; that's why I'm trying to find the BEST of the BEST of these books to give away. If you know of any MORE of these books that are in EXCELLENT condition that I can buy at a reasonable price, could you please let me know? Thanking you in advance! Sheree Heller."
2,Stone is too small,"I have not purchased, but at 10 by 8 millimeters, the stone is smaller than what I'm looking for. Can anyone let me know where I can find a larger stone?"
2,buyer beware -- 70% restocking fee,"I wanted to return this item but did not read the fine print before ordering -- there is a 70% RESTOCKING FEE, even though I didn't even open the package. This item took a very long time to receive. In the meantime, I saw many other similar products available locally at a fraction of the cost."
4,a tastey hammer dracula,"i love hammers dracula series and this one dosen't let you down. once more christopher lee turns in a great job as the count. this one is a must have. sit back and enjoy the goose bumps,and watch what you drink"
4,Quite good,"The movie itself is quite good, but Christopher Lee's lines are few and far between and are inane when they do occur. This is what made him appear on and off throughout the Dracula series, his objections to the ridiculous dialogue. Mr. Lee spoke no lines whatsoever in 'Dracula: Prince Of Darkness' because he quite simply refused to speak the lines he was given (!) and Hammer felt they could not do without him at this point.Other than the fact that this is an excellent movie, the most attractive aspect of this DVD release is the picture itself. It must be the most well-preserved film in the entire Hammer library. The clarity, the color, the skin-tones, all better than any other Hammer film. This applies to both interior and exterior shots. The quality is better even than many modern films. There are no 'pops', no lines, no 'eyelashes', it is incredibly clean even, as I mentioned, by modern standards.Check it out while there are still plenty to go around!"
2,Average,"What was the point in Dracula even being in the picture? The story seemed to be leading more toward three bored men and their family problems. There didnt seem to be much to do as far as the count was concerned. Granted, Christopher Lee has never been my favorite, but even he has done better with the ""Scars of Dracula"" and ""The horror of Dracula"" Two stars at best."
1,What happened?,"I'd rather watch AD1972 before I watched this one again. The storyline was cool, but certain things were just too cheesy. For one, look at Christopher Lee's hair in this one. It doesn't have that neat, slicked back look anymore. It bulges on the sides. Secondly, everytime he has one of the three men murdered that killed his servant, he counts it off. Like when the first one dies, he says, ""the first."" I began to suspect that he would say ""the second"" when next one died, and unfortunately, I was correct. And what's this at the end when he resorts to throwing things at the people who are trying to get rid oh him? This was the biggest disappointment of the movie. Dracula is superhuman, and you see that in Prince of Darkness when he breaks a sword in half with his bare hands. Yet, he is now reduced to chunking whatever he can pick up to defend himself. I may watch this one again, but that is only because I admire Christopher Lee."
2,A Poor Sequel to a Really Scarry Movie,"This one lacks the bone chilling horror of its predecessor (Dracula Has Risen From the Grave) and uses a very ""audience insulting"" way of bringing back Dracula from the dead. Dracula, impaled on a cross at the end of the last film has turned to red dust. He is brought back by a guy who puts the dust in a goblet and mixes in some of his own blood to make the ultimate ""bloody mary,"" which he drinks and then he himself turns into Dracula. I remember being scared out of my wits by the earlier movie and being bored by this one. I definately recommend getting that one instead."
5,bloody good !,"well we had prety much given up hope of ever seeing a decent version of this classic Dracula adventure when Warner anouncedit's release in an unbutchered state.the image is flawless , the sound is good if not expansive but the real treat is that the 4 minutes missing from every print released so far has this time been included.The bordelo scene is now free of the savage editing done by warner in the early 70's to be able to market it to the kiddies.The other additions are very short scenes juged to violent at the time.The result is a film that flows better & has a stronger story & that's it rates a 5 on my scale.review of the DVD edition"
3,Taste the Averageness of Hammer,"Hammer was just about in the beginning of its downward spiral when they went into production on ""Taste"". Christopher Lee was already tired of playing Drac and his performance consists of little more than standing around glaring and making silly little pronouncements to no one in particular. The action seems to take place in spite of him rather than because of him. Ralph Bates must have hit the coffee pretty hard right before his scenes because he's a bit over-amped and over-camped. It's still full of the lush Hammer treats like costuming, great character actors, excellent sets and smouldering atmosphere. What it lacks is a compelling story and any particular raison d'etre."
4,He's Back,"In this version of Dracula, played by Christopher Lee, the location is in Victorian England. Lord Courtley, played by Ralph Bates, resurrects Dracula with the aid of three Victorian gentlemen, but when Courtley drinks Dracula's blood he dies and the three leave him for dead. Dracula revenges the death of his servant by seducing their children and having them kill their own fathers.This movie was made a year after Dracula Has Risen From The Grave and the next in the series was The Scars of Dracula.Another interesting note is that Ralph Bates became Hammer's next leading man."
2,You still can't get the help,"Problem one: ""They have killed my disciple, so shall they be destroyed!"" Why should an aristocrat give a damn about the help? Especially one with a notorious psychopathic personality disorder like the Count. He's hardly likely to put himself in harm's way for yet another rubbish servant, is he? He didn't exactly give a monkey's when Clove got shot in 'Dracula, Prince of Darkness'. Instead he shrugged his shoulders and went swimming. Admittedly fully clothed, but with the help gone you're not used to being self sufficient. Anyway, I think he'd be more likely to offer the three gentlemen in question employment. If they can kill his servant then they must be pretty handy acolytes. The rich are not like you or me, they think differently. Especially after being dead a few hundred years."
3,Better than the title,"The fourth Christpher Lee Dracula film is a definite improvement over the previous two. Three respected men have a secret society where they partake of sin weekly. The men run into a young hell-raiser (Ralph Bates) who tells them he can give them an ultimate adventure and then proceeds to drink the blood of Dracula, the three men kill him out of fear. Dracula then appears out of the ashes of the dead man and vows revenge on the three who killed his follower. Christopher Lee is not given enough to do and does not come into the film until about half an hour into it, but the film still finds a way to work. The plot is average, but the quick pace and timely shocks help this film a great deal. The supporting cast does well, ecspecially Bates(in his Hammer debut) and John Carson. The ending is not one of the best, but the road to it is exciting and well done."
4,THAT'S WHAT FRIENDS ARE FOR,"One of the four movies in the 'Joanne Kilbourne Mysteries', A COLDER KIND OF DEATH is a competent little thriller. Wendy Crewson returns as Kilbourne, who is shocked when the murderer of her husband is finally caught after six years. The accused professes his innocence, but in vain when a sniper kills him on the way out of the police station. Who is responsible and why did they kill him. The accused also has a malicious wife, played with seething venom by Kari Matchett, who suggests she had an affair with the late Mr. Kilbourne. The suspects include a cache of politically motivated friends, including Oscar nominee Teri Garr (from TOOTSIE).Brad Turner keeps his direction crisp, and the performances overall are very good. Victor Garber (now on ABC's ALIAS) has a solid presence as Kilbourne's ex-partner.I've enjoyed the three of these movies I've viewed so far; they're intelligent and good mysteries."
1,Made for TV Movie,"This is a made for TV movie with a made for TV cast. If you want to watch a movie like this just set your DVR to record anything on LMN and you will get the same result. Don't pay to watch this movie, you can get versions of it all day long for free. I recognized a lot of the cast from tv shows and must say the ones I recognized were better in their more recent TV rolls. Don't waste your time."
3,late to arrive,"This product came a day late, and had the longest time to ship when ordered (3 other items from various vendors, including Amazon, arrived earlier than the promised date). The DVD arrived in good condition."
3,Not enough examples,"This book is pretty good on theory, but doesn't have enough practical examples to be a standalone text."
5,The best book of elementary probability,This is a must buy for people who would like to learn elementary probability. The only background you need is basic series and calculus. This is the best probability book I have seen.
1,Definitely NOT Recommended,"I was expecting/hoping this to be reliable in its thrashing of the 12 signs. Much to my disappointment, it is not. For example, most of the description given to Aquarius just is not true. As an astrologer, I found this book neither entertaining nor accurate and that makes it a total waste of your money. Non-astrologers may be taken in by some general references to their sign, but can also be deceived by the gross inaccuracies of the descriptions. Save your money!"
3,COLD BLOODED,"I HAVE TO ADMIT THIS BOOK WAS KIND OF ON POINT, ALTHOUGH WITH THE WHOLE ASTROLOGY THING IT IS NEVER 100% ACCURATE. IT TELLS YOU PROBABLY WHAT YOU DO NOT WANT TO HEAR. HOWEVER, I DON'T RECOMMEND SPENDING YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY ON THIS BOOK OF NEGATIVITY."
1,too redundant,"I'm taking a new, serious (almost obsessive) interest in Astrology and owned 3 books prior to buying this one. I found everything that this book has to say about me and other signs quite funny, but it was too redundant! The author needs a thersaus and somebody who can actually proofread this thing. This book is very short. How hard can it be to find new words, phrases, or even proofread? I could have done all of that easily when I was ten. However, the sarcastic tone is quite good, but it's still a waste of money."
1,Stupid,"I have no idea where they came up with this book! It is completely horrid, and I like books about the dark sides of astrology. This book is a waste of time and money!"
4,Nasty Astology,Great book to see the true other side of your sign. Yes we always want to see the good but we know we all have our demons and dark sides too.
1,this sucks!!!,I HAVE NOT RECEIVED EITHER COPY OF THIS BOOK AND I HAVE ORDERED TWO!!!! WHAT SORT OF BUSINESS ARE YOU GUYS RUNNING....THE ORDER WAS MADE ON NOVEMBER 24TH...HELLLOOOOOO....
3,Shiverhead deserves more attention for his earlier works.,"This CD is good, but not great. I've been listening to his older, underproduced music for quite a few years and when I finally found this CD, I was ecstatic! However, the ecstasy wore off once I got it in the CD player and hit Play. Shiverhead, on the whole, is excellent, but this just wasn't as good as what I was accustomed to. I'd heard ""Destroy Belief"" before on the ""Death Rave 2010"" compilation (which also has his cover of AC/DC's ""Highway To Hell"" on it, which is great fun). The title track is okay and so is the remix of it. I liked ""Unsafe,"" but...it's no ""Enjoy The Violence."" Still, if you've heard Shiverhead before and this is the only CD you've come across, by all means buy it."
3,Early stages of development,"First this edition of Gabe's Dixon's band is nowhere's near the finished product his 2nd effort is. I was really disappointed with the production (really raw, edgy) and the tunes just don't hit home the way his 2nd CD repetoire does. The sax player's contributions however well intended just don't compliment the band and his sound on the instrument is weak. I bought this on the strength of Gabe's 2nd effort which just blows me away. This CD sounds like a band gettting it's act together, which it eventually did, unfortunately it didn't gel on this CD. By all means go see Gabe live. He really gives an inspiring performance!!"
4,Man of La Mancha,"Loose in structure and uneven in workmanship, this novel remains unsurpassed as a masterpiece of droll humor, as a picture of Spanish life, as a gallery of immortal portraits.Written in 1605, and intended as a parody of the romances of chivalry, this volume contains the whole of the first part of the novel, and is complete in itself."
1,Read the description carefully - Caveat Emptor!,"The purchase price of this item - $95 delivered - does not include a power supply. An additional purchase is necessary to use this thing. Also, it is little larger than a pair of packs of cigarettes. I cannot comment on its efficacy, as I cannot turn it on. Boy, do I feel stupid."
1,waste of time,"the author obviously has never played or coached basketball on any competent level.anyone can take a bunch of stories from other more knowlegible authors and compile them. this is what was done here.dont waste your time on this light weight puff piece, better to read books by real basketball players themselves than this recycled regurgitated pap."
5,Love it!!!,I love sterling silver and decided to take a chance in ordering this ring. And I'm glad I did. I absolutely love it. It is just perfect. I've received compliments from friends and strangers alike.Suggestion: Please consider having more rings available in 1/2 sizes.
4,I'm Blessed by Low Rawls,"I just happened to see this CD while thumbing through CDs in a book/music store and thought I would buy becuase I liked a lot of the songs on it. I was truly surprised and impressed by what I heard. I now listen to it every morning while getting ready for work. I especially like the medley which includes ""Nearer my God to Thee"" and ""Touch the Hem of His Garment."" The song that I enjoy most is ""Did You Stop to Pray This Morning."" It really lifts my spirits and starts me on my way in a good, positive, and spiritual mood. I would recommend this CD to anyone who enjoys gospel music."
2,Disappointed,"The CD arrived in a timely manner, but from the 8th song to the end of the CD is just a garbled mess. Tried cleaning the CD to no avail."
4,Long but worth it!,"It took me awhile to finish this book. But as soon as I did I realized how much I actually enjoyed it. I found myself crying and laughing with Smokey through this book, I loved how ""Downtown"" takes you from Smokey's life as a naive young Irish Catholic girl moving away from home for the first time TO an amazing grown woman. If you can handle a 500 page book with a heroin who's searching for herself and a bunch of quirky characters on the magazine staff, you'll love it!"
3,"As a big Anne River-Siddons fan, I was disappointed in this","Most of Siddon's characters are introduced early in their lives and when a major occurrance happens, they weather life-changing growth. Downtown's character was too one-dimensional; her growth wasn't really believable and the ending jumping to present-day circumstances and a ""surprise"" husband was contrived. Siddon's characters are what I ready her books for and Smokey did not come across as a real person. Read all of Siddon's other books before going to this one. If this is your first Siddon's book, it may be your last."
1,Downtown,I am shocked by some of these reviews! Are we talking about the same book? This is truly one of the most useless books I have ever read.
2,What's up with this?,"Just wondered if anyone else has ever cottoned to the fact that the scene where Smoky visits La Carrousel with Luke, and sits with him, John Howard, and Juanita the Black Panther, is duplicated from ""Peachtree Road""? Check out Chapter 16 of PR, in which Shep, Lucy, and Jack Venable visit the same club. Much of it has been translated verbatim, even to Smoky's awareness of her white flesh glowing ""rottenly among all the rich shades of blackness around her"" (or something like that), the same dialogue with two of MLK Jr's lieutenants, and the same description and encounter with King himself. What's up with that, I wonder? Did the author run out of inspiration...or did she underestimate her audience's intelligence? I agree with the assessments below, by the way, that it's a substandard effort. Siddons can do, and has done, much better."
1,Not up to the standards we expect from Siddons,"I am an avid fan of Ann Rivers Siddons but I thought this book would never end and when it did I couldn't believe she would waste so much effort on a self-indulgent group of people. Normally her characters have character but these people were all shallow, unthinking dilletantes. However I am an older person and perhaps should listen to my nieces and their children when they keep insisting-- this is the nineties."
2,Disappointment for a Siddons fan,The author is not at her best. Her books like Hill Towns and Fault Lines about middle aged women in troubled marriages are much more interesting. The prose doesn't flow well either. It required concentration for a relatively light subject.
4,"""Downtown"" Doesn't Disappoint","Anne Rivers Siddons has introduced me to a part of my country that I know nothing about: the South. Growing up approximately at the same time as Siddons, my life experiences are similar but the locales are so different. Her ability to create a sense of time and place are remarkable. Her characters have complexity and depth. While ""Downtown"" is not my favorite, I find it fills in a nitch about Atlanta that needed exploration. ""Peachtree Road"" is a good place to begin with Siddons. And if you want another perspecitve about this period of the South's history, check out Thomas Cook's ""Streets of Fire"". Thanks to both of these authors for their immense wealth of knowledge, ability to spin a yarn and make me care about their protagonists."
1,THE WORST RAP CD THAT I EVER HEARD,"THIS CD IS NO GOOD THE LYRICS ARE JUNK THE MUSIC MAKES YOU THROW UP I WANTED TO SUE SOUTH PARK MEXICAN FOR THIS JUNK CD THAT I BOUGHT FOR 17 DOLLARS BUT IS NOT WORTH WASTING TIME ON THIS JUNK.I HATE VANILLA ICE BUT SOUTH PARK MEXICAN IS WORST THAN THE VAILLA ICE.IF YOU WANT TO BUY A STREET HIP HOP CD BUY DR.DRE OR D12 OR IF YOU LIKE CHICANO RAP BUY SPANISH FLY,L.S.D FULLY STRAPPED,THE FROST BUT DONT BUY SOUTH PARK MEXICAN THE HOMIE COULD NOT RAP LIKE PEOPLE SAID DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON JUNK LIKE HIM"
5,"SPM, A RAP LEGEND",SPM has some of the most tighest songs I ever heard. Wizard of Oz is the song I think was the $hit.Much props to the Houston homeboys.
1,THE WORST RAPPER IN THE WORLD,"OH NO WHY DO RECORD COMPANIES LET PEOPLE TO RAP AND SELL RECORDS,THIS RAPPER IS WORST THAN WATCHING GRASS GROWS,DONT BUY THIS CD IS WASTE OF CASH.BUY OTHER CD'S FROM OTHER RAPPERS BUT NOT SOUTH PARK MEXCAN EVEN THE NAME IS JUNK....."
5,Hustle Town THE best of him,hey raza just writing a few lines for my boy SPM this is my homeboy el es el hombre this CD is real talk 2 ya soon
5,WoW!!!,"HMMMMM...i usualy listen to alot of country music, and i hate rap music...but *S.P.M* is a total exception. i love the songs.GeT ThE CD's!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Review that could have helped.,"I had gone to the conference with much knowledge about the subject. I was told about the book from there. Could I have obtained it, I would have been the top in the list of performers."
4,Solid Products,"Very good kit to use for painting hard to reach areas without a ladder. I definitely sacrificed some on the quality side of painting, but not having to lug a 15 ft ladder around the hard to reach areas is a sacrifice I'm willing to make. The edger was more challenging than the roller as you have to make sure the top of the edger doesn't get wet paint or your ceiling/trim will suffer.The edger went on thicker than the roller, so I actually had to do an extra coat with the roller to even it out."
1,Terrible - i am returning it,Low volume ... people can not hear me at the other end. I therefore have to return it.I liked my Siemens 8825 much much better.Other complaints:1. No central office voice mail indicator2. All handsets display the same missed call messages; so the same missed call has to be handled 4 times. A very stupiddesign.3. Large heavy handset4. This is not a phone system. It is a collection of phones.
2,Low Audio to remote end,"I have had this phone for several months now. People I talk to say they can hardly hear me. When I plug in a headset, they can hear me a little better. When I use the speakerphone on the handset, the people I talk to can hear my voice louder than without it. It is a nice phone with good features, but yelling into the phone is starting to get old. I have two handsets and both have poor audio. I can hear people fine. A call to Panasonic was little help. Not many 5.8 2 line phones out there, but I wouldn't waste time on this one."
5,FALL IN LOVE...AFTER ADULTERY,"I loved this movie, sometimes love can be there all along, we just take it for granted..and miss it! It took an affair to make them realize they both learned things about each other that they overlooked in the beginning"
5,Fabulous!,Norton and Watts are incredible together. The rest of the cast is great too. It's refreshing to view a plot that is different or unusual from the usual.
4,I liked this movie a lot more than I thought i would,"My wife picked this as our movie of the night, and I really wasn't sure I would enjoy it - it did seem to be more oriented towards the female demographic. Still, it turned out to be really good - the acting was top-notch and the costumes and sets and semi-historical setting were very well done. I'd recommend it."
5,Better than book,Love era movies. This takes place in the 20's. when you didn't have any technical gadgets. How easy is it to get lost with or without it.
1,The Painted Veil,"Movie might be good but could not finishe watching it, since it was damaged. I did send it back and am waiting for a refund or replacement.Vado"
3,One major wrong note,"A period film is a very delicate thing--it doesn't take much to break the spell that transports a viewer into another time and place. Unfortunately, Edward Norton's amateurish performance in the ""Painted Veil"" kept breaking the spell for me in what otherwise was an interesting film. Norton has been great in other films but seems to be on autopilot here, investing his character with very ""actory"" mannerisms and a Madonna-style phony British accent. Naomi Watts and Liev Schrieber are excellent but can't keep the film alive when Norton's in the frame. I hate to say it, but even Brad Pitt would have been more believable in the role, and at least he would have been nice to look at. In all, a well-made film with some fascinating ideas that is sunk by a bad casting decision."
1,The Painted Veil,This was a terrible copy and had to be restarted several times during the showing of it. It had skips and I would not give it a good rating at all.
4,Great Movie,Great Movie with unexpected twists. Not a huge fan of Naomi Watts bit I liked her in this. Love Ed Norton always.
2,Miserable,"Well, that's two hours of my life I won't get back. This movie is slow, and I found the characters thoroughly unlikable. They just kept making themselves and each other as miserable as possible, and just when things started to look up, they came crashing back down to a miserable ending. No matter how well-made a movie is, if I can't stand the characters, their actions, or the plot, what's the point?"
3,Lovely but unsatisfying,"It is the 1920s in England, and Walter (Edward Norton), a shy, bookish doctor marries vivacious Kitty (Naomi Watts) who just wants to get away from her mother. They move to China where Kitty strays with a dashing diplomat while Walter decides to go up-country to fight a cholera epidemic.This tale of repression and desire left me strangely cold. Norton lamely attempts a British accent but is never even remotely convincing as the awkward doctor; he just looks too American. Watts is fine as the spoiled rich girl, but the script lets them both down; the loveless marriage is never satisfactorily resolved and the overall feeling of detachment and disinterest spreads to the audience. Neither Walter nor Kitty is likeable or sympathetic; he's too stubborn and proud and she's too shallow and self-centered.Although the photography is gorgeous and the look of the film is quite lush, the story is dreary and dull. Disappointing."
3,A beautiful and lush film that is very slow in it's pacing,"I totally understand this film, and I have read the book.I found that the characters were different than the novel,but that is not the point that I need to make here. As reviewing the film alone, I doubt that nobody will quibble with the fact that this is a beautifully filmed piece of work that had an equally compelling soundtrack.I found the colour and the editing to be exquisite, in fact.I personally felt that the pacing of the film was the biggest problem. In fact, it dragged severely in my opinion. No matter how compelling a story or how good the actors, if the pace is slow then the filmsimply has no energy and suffers from jet lag. I personally admire the work of Edward Norton, but this film simply left me flat. That it received nominations did not surprise me at all.That it won none did not surprise me either."
3,love ed norton but this movie was not as good as I wanted it to be,the performances were excellent but the movie was a little slow
5,This movie didn't get the credit it deserves!,"This is an absolutely stunning and beautiful movie. Just watched it on a premium channel and went straight to Amazon to buy it. Outstanding cast (Ed Norton should have received an Oscar), beautiful scenery, great music and a heart breaking love story. I wish they would make more movies like this one!"
4,"Really gorgeous, if slightly uneven","Everything about the movie was great apart from the last section. It is almost as if they suddenly looked around and thought, oh dear, film's too long. I would have liked to have seen them 'in love' a little bit more before the denouement.Having said that, the first part of the film meanders like a slow river, with most of the action in flashback. So perhaps an evening out of the two might have worked.They really manage to capture the heat and conditions of the times, and Naomi Watts, while playing a selfish byotch of a character, really transforms in the course of the film in a believable manner. And as a result, he transforms in our eyes.Diana Rigg is great too as a catalyst for them both. And the ending was pitch perfect. I ended up really feeling for all the characters in this tense, chilling, but ultimately heartwarming movie."
5,Best Love Story Ever,This movie is perhaps the most passionate love story of all time. It reflects the true essence of love. Marriage is not always what couples believe it will be and learning forgiveness is essential to the success of a marriage because there will be heart ache and pain. This movie is a lesson in forgiveness. Truly an unexspected surprise in an all too common mistake.
2,Screenplay?,"This beautifully produced motion picture should have worked. the cinematography, the talented cast, the music, the backdrops. And all of this is beautifully done. What is missing is life, elan. Some activity would have been nice. Once, the good doctor confronts his wife about her infidelity, nothing much takes place. Yes, there's a cholera epidemic in the midst of some of the most stunning scenery on earth. Yes, two previously irreconcilable spouses, probably never in love in the first place, somehow find each other as well as a mutual purpose in life, and should go on to spend a fulfilling life together.The problem seems to lie within the screenplay, which is curiously flat, devoid of emotion. This film simply fails to draw the viewer in. You can learn a lot about the cholera outbreaks in early 20th century China, but it's difficult to care except in the intellectual sense."
4,Painted vail review,If anyone wants to believe the British actually colonized anywhere without exploiting the hell out of the place well this may make an interesting movie.The film also indirectly gives some credit to the Communists. Anyway it's also a love story about two very human people who have a lot of failings but make a relationship work in spite of all manner of difficulty. Light years beyond anything out of Hollywood and well worth seeing.
4,Finding love too late,"I really enjoyed this film. Edward Norton is certainly one of thebetter young actors in hollywood today. The setting is beautiful. the movie showshow we sometime want things one way and when it does not work out, we do not even try to enjoy what we do have. She found out too late that she hada loving, caring husband but did not appreciate him."
5,Best movie I have seen in ages.,"This movie was terrific. The scenery was lovely (other than the people dying of cholera) and the story was just amazing. This movie made me a fan of Edward Norton (I never saw him as attractive before) and Naomi Watts (could take or leave her), they were perfect. I wish movies were consistently this good."
4,the painted veil,"A beutifully film. The scenery just spectacular! Why Oh Why has Edward Norton taken on the posture and mannerism's and the mumbling of the late Marlon Brando. It is damned annoying. Perhaps if the movie was seen in the theater with all the sound systems if would help.I spent watching the whole damn movie wondering what did he say? I can hear flea fart, so I'm qualifed to make this critque."
3,Predictable,It was an OK movie but nothing spectacular.Like the scenery and acting was OK but no one stood out.
4,Beautiful film,A little long but great film. Gorgeously made and good character development. Theme music is incredible. Good movie a must have
4,The Painted Veil,Good Movie. A well filmed and beautiful movie with beautiful scenery and believable characters. Some of the hospital scenes are a little hard to watch but they are a necessary part of the film and do not take away anything from the enjoyment of watching. I liked it and am glad to include it in my collection of films at home.
5,Beautiful and Tragic,"This is a tragic story of love and betrayal, with the most beautiful scenes of rural China. I know I will watch it again just for the scenery. It is a story that hangs together well (based on the novel by W. Somerset Maugham) and has a nice little twist at the end. Naomi Watts and Edward Norton are well cast, and fully immerse themselves in their respective characters. Very highly recommended."
5,Wonderful movie,"Beautifully written, exquisite cinematography, wonderful acting. I wasn't to sure about this movie - my prime free movies are running a bit low! And after seeing it, I wonder why I didn't see it sooner. I love it when that happens. [SPOILER ALERT]. It's a bittersweet love story about a selfish, young debutante (Watts) who marries a doctor (Norton). Norton is in love with Watts, who consistently disappoints. They go to China so that Norton can help with a terrible cholera epidemic. Their story unfolds, sometimes painfully. When they finally to rekindle what you think is hopeless... I will let the viewer see for him/herself! A must-see!"
4,Beautiful Photography !,"A good job from the cinamatographer; great editing also. Unsure where filmed, appears to be asia. Just wonderful local colour! A re-told movie that is acted to the hilt by both Actors. Sad , but mature ending. Worth a see."
4,A moving story of estrangement & reconciliation...,"This is a slow paced but beautiful film about marital betrayal, estrangement, reconciliation, forgiveness and love. The cinematography is spectacular, as most of the movie was shot on location in China. Edward Norton and Naomi Watts do a good job as the couple with the tortured relationship. Its pacing and theme will prompt many to dismiss it as a ""Chick Flick,"" but that label does not do justice to this fine movie."
3,"D for Depressing, But Still a good movie","This movie is morose treatment of what occurs within a marriage after one commits adultery. It's a story that focuses upon the resentment and hate that can swell up between individuals when the bond of trust is destroyed. It's also a story about how love can reemerge among people who have found themselves in this position. It's also a story about naiveté and the need to be loved. All the emotions found within life are found within this movie. So, in the end it is a real treat, but just one that's a little depressing. Get the movie, it's a real treat."
2,Pretty long and slow,"The Painted Veil has it all going for itself. Naomi Watts and Edward Norton leading, two great actors. An interesting theme and issue, Cholera in China in 1920 and a great location to tease beauty from, but none of this is taken to its advantage. The movie was such a disappointment. I honestly thought that since I read so many good reviews of this film, it's going to pick up soon. But it never did. Honestly, the only good thing about this movie was the scenery and acting. That's it. The storyline seemed good, but, was this movie a bore! It lasted roughly two hours, but it seemed like a good five. I was wondering when the heck this movie was going to end. It was so long and drawn out. The entire movie was dialogue. That's it. There was no action whatsoever. I am not a lover of melodramas but if you want to see a good recent one, see The Lives of Others."
5,A second look?,"Love is but an illusion until you've experienced true love.Saw this a few years ago,,,and if anything it's more meaningful now.A beautiful performance by Naomi Ellen Watts!"
5,wonderful and surprising,"this movie is wonderful because of Edward Norton, one of my favorite actors. I try to see everything he is in. I know he is not classic heart throb but I find him strangly attractive. Surprising because of Naomi Watts. She has never been a favorite of mine, but here she was a great. Who knew she could act!!! Since she and Norton were producers of this production, maybe the problem has been her material. Well here she and Norton were perfect. I am adding this movie to my pile that I will reccommend but not lend, because I might not get it back,"
4,Refreshing!,"It does not take an anthropology degree to gain great perspective from the refreshing glimpse Bruce Chatwin has given us into aboriginal Australia. His adventures and insights have deep meaning to those of us who profoundly love these people and the land of the Australian continent. It does not gloss over the problems and difficulties of the modern day, but charges head on into analysis of them, and I love and cherish this book. Bruce's writing style may seem unfocused only if you actually miss the messages--otherwise, an outstanding read and I am sad we have lost his voice to forever."
3,Bruce Chatwin wrote half a book...,"The Songlines really captured my attention. Human ecology, cultural anthropology, human evolution, cultural imperialism, Songlines, Native Australians (""aborigines""), travels... this is a book with information about a people and a place. I enjoyed the flow and pace of the story, and I hope I learned the reality of Native Australian culture.However, Bruce Chatwin chose to use this book to publish assorted observations, quotes, and reflections from other travels. For me (me), they affected the flow of his storytelling, my ability to focus on the theme - Australia, not nomads - and the ending. Perhaps this is a style thing, and I don't know if Chatwin applies this style in his other books.Didn't work for me. I wanted a conclusion to his original story."
1,Dissapointment,I was expecting some real description of how the Aborigines communicate. This book is just a jumbled collection of unrelated happenings. The assorted characters are very unattractive for the most part. These opinions were shared by most of my Book Club members. Don't waste your money--I did.
2,A Must Read,"I read this book along with several other ""travel books"" this summer and was startled by its genius.chatwin is a very captivating figure , a remarkable amateur traipsing through any number of disciplines en route, he hoped, to mankind's nomadic quintessence. Unlike other aspirant travel writers his books are clorful and detailed. He may have been wrong but he was brilliantly wrong."
2,Disappointing...,"I read it because some people recommended it to me as ""the father of travel writing"". However, it's not been a page-turner to me..."
5,An Experience of the Sacred,"Bruce Chatwin takes the reader on a delightful journey across cultures and through time and space as he looks at issues of creation, history, tradition, and the sacred. His ""real time"" journeys are delightfully laced with story telling, philosophical pondering and reflection, and humor. His reverence for life and indigineous people is clear. Songlines are sacred for the aborigines - and the book itself draws the reader into an experience of the sacred."
4,A travelogue that needs no slide show,"Since my first reading four years ago, I've returned to The Songlines time and time again. Chatwain not only captures the thrill and awkwardness inherent in most journeys, but also gives us a view of aboriginal culture unlike any other. You'll truly ""wish you were there."""
5,Dreaming Chatwin,"An adventure in Australia? No. A traveller's log? No. An aboriginal rite of passage tale? No. A historical account? No. Songlines is the story of the Dreaming. It is a book about all the above in no particular order. The story unfolds when Bruce, the author and narrator starts his learning about Australia and the Aboriginal people through Arkady, a Russian-born Australian with a thorough but not glamorous understanding of the Aboriginals. Bruce is searching for himself the true meaning of the Songlines. This is his Work. By listening to Arkady, he learns. By going to Australia, he understands, or does he?"
3,A Cultural Renaissance,"The Songlines starts off as seemingly boring...Chatwin's narrative style is monolithic and virtually empty. However, as the book progresses, we learn of the Aboriginal culture, from Chatwin's point of view anyway. For anyone who has the remotest interest in Antropology, this book could be of interest. While Chatwin's analysis of the Aboriginals isn't nescessarily strictly accurate, it is the closest many of us will get and provides a compelling read. The book is somewhat biographical; most of the events described in the novel-like narrative of the book are, at least, based on truth. This makes it more astounding, because it's just not a figment of the author's imagination."
5,"Dennis The Menace, eat your heart out...!","I recently finished plowing through the collected paperback editions of the classic 1940s/1950s ""Little Lulu"" comics, and wanted to put in my vote... yes! yes! yes! True, it's a little disappointing that the strips are reprinted in black-&-white and not in the original color versions, but the real genius of these works is in the draftsmanship of artists John Stanley and Irving Tripp, and once you get onto their wavelength, even these half-size B&W reprints are a pure delight. They can say so much with such economy -- a single panel of Lulu's unbridled mischief can have you laughing your head off, and here, in this multi-volume collection, you've got a real treasure trove of some of the best graphic-art humor produced in the 20th Century. Great stuff, highly recommended, and major kudos to Dark Horse for making this artwork both available and affordable."
2,Poorly written,"Too much fluff and perspective. Very poor editing, misspelling and hence technical errors are rampant. Would be a good book if there wasn't so much fluff and author had stuck to storyline. I was there (B/7/17th)and take exception at anti-war digs embedded in story."
5,Red Bird Down,"I usually do not read a lot of fiction, but during an extended stay in the hospital I got introduced to military novels. An ex-military friend of mine recommended I start with a novel about the Air Calvary in Vietnam. It was ""Red Bird Down"".Not knowing what to expect I dove in head first into reading ""Red Bird Down"". After a while I noticed my mind wandering due to the realism of the setting. I had been an Air Calvary pilot and it brought back a lot of memories. At times it was hard for me to remember it was just a novel. It was written in such realism until it was sometimes hard to differentiate between fiction and possibly non-fiction. You can tell that the author not only wrote about the Air Calvary, but he also lived it.I would highly recommend this book to any reader. I would especially recommend it to military and aviation buffs."
4,new faces,Army of Freshmen's self titled debut rocks. They are based in Vventura(where I live) and the bass player is my math tutor coincidentially. Their pop/rock formula is fresh and a welcome change to the polluted music scene today. If you like No Doubt or Fountains of Wayne. buy it
5,Nintendo pop ???,"The Army of Freshmen is a California band hailing from Ventura County.I periodically check independent charts and found this album to be # 1. So I decided to give them a listen and see what the buzz was about. The first track of the album explodes and at once you are drawn into Chris Jay's raspy vocals that strangly resemble folk singer Phil Cody. His lyrics of teenage love, and angst are sometimes poignant and other times satirical. Poppy guitar riffs and perfect drumming compliment each other as the really gem and defining sound in the band takes the lead - dual synthesizers. The two syntesizer players give the songs a nice dance quality that will make it hard to not get out of your chairs. Roughly summed up, think Blink 182 had a child with They might be giants and raised him/her during the 80's. The bottom line is you will not be dissapointed with this album."
3,hiking poles,"The hiking poles arrived quickly but in two large separate boxes, unnecessary packaging and postage. I like them moderately! I don't notice the advertised ""shock absorber"" quality. The handles are a bit bulky and have no finger depressions. They are okay as a spare pair for guests but I like my Gabel poles better."
3,"It's Functional, But Not a Leki","This is a copy of a Leki. I didn't try, but I'd guess that the parts are interchangeable. Not that you'd want to, it's not as robust.If you're a twice a year hiker, or petite, this is probably a good buy. If you hike a lot and use/abuse your poles, stay with Leki."
3,Ok for both uses,"ok as a walking stick and as a monopod, only negative is that it should collapse to a smaller size for travel"
2,Great idea but poorly implemented,"I used this pole on a hiking trip in the Sipsey Wilderness of North Alabama. The pole was used while hiking about 12 miles.The quality of the pole itself is very very good. The length adjustments don't slip like cheaper poles. The anti-shock function works, but seems completely unnecessary.The handle, though, is flimsy. The foam only surrounds the pole and does not go over the top to hold it in place. Additionally it is not adhered to the pole, so it slips down the pole if you happen to mis-step and pull down on the handle very hard. Also, the top camera mount pulled out. It is simply a ~1.5cm plug that is pressed into the top of the hollow pole. I'd hate to be the guy who loses his camera while filming over a ledge because the ""cap"", that is the camera mount, fell out.Overall I wouldn't recommend this pole to anyone. There are other poles exactly like this one with better handles for around the same price."
4,Sturdy tool for the novice,Used this on Hesperus on my first climb. Won't ever climb without one and converted my dad - a long time climber. BUT other reviews had it right - this is NOT meant for the climber who is really hard on tools. The rubber base ended up with the steel bottom breaking through it and the round cap came off. The tension coil spring was AWESOME! and we both (at various times) liked the adjustable height option. I would not only recommend it -I plan on getting another!
4,HP 1 Hiking Pole with monopod,I have not had a chance to actually use the item as intended but will once the weather is warmer. I was looking for a monopod combination hiking pole/cane. I have a weak right leg after seven major surgeries so I often need added support for my leg. I also am an avid photographer but carrying a tripod is not always very practical and most of the time for school and church concerts not possible. This will allow me to carry a way to steady my camera shots especially for movies and still have something with me for walking.Send me an email come next fall and by then I should have had enough time and experience with this to truly evaluate the dual purposes.
3,avery product,The construction is reasonably sound. hand strap also easy to adjust. The main body probably last a while.Lost the tip on the first use.The compus is of little use and the weight is a bit more than I would like on long treks.The pair I got from Walmart is cheaper and better.
5,Hiking Pole with Mono Pad,"I just want to say I love this Hiking pole with Mono Pad. I would always get back in the woods and wish I had my Tripod with me for my camera, but who wants to carry a Tripod around through the woods. This works great for me. I always have a walking stick while I'm in the woods and with this if I need a Tripod I have one. Just take the knob off and there is a mono pad. Wish I would have thought of that. I might not be so broke. lol..Thanks AmazonKurt Surber"
4,Great value for the money,"What some of the previous reviewers have said is true, the locking mechanism is counterintuitive, it turns in the opposite directions of the markings, but that being said, this is a great item. Just got it and took it on a 6 mile hike. Its light weight, I feel safer walking with it and for the money you can't go wrong. I am glad I bought it."
4,Does the job,"Bought for my wife to use while hiking - we bought it to use as a monopod for the camera, but it's not as useful as we had hoped. It works great as a monopod and it works great as a hiking pole, but it's cumbersome switching from one use to the other. The thermometer is wildly inaccurate."
4,"Small, light, works great with a few tweaks.","I've had one for over 10 years. The best thing is it is light and handy. It has two shortcomings, already listed in other reviews. It is a bit underpowered, and it can jam on small twigs. I solved the first problem by inserting a 9.6V battery in place of the 7.2V. Yeah, it sticks out the back a little, but it works great. The second problem is caused by the gap between the overlapping blades being to big. I took my blades apart and ground down the blade spacers a bit, and now it never jams. I can now whack through 1/2"" limbs with ease. Best hedge trimmer ever, after a few tweaks."
1,Why Not Tell The Voltage?,"If the battery and charger are sold separately, there may be customers that have both. Please state the voltage,"
1,Don't Buy This Book,This book was a disappointment. I have been a trust attorney for over fifteen years and I found this source book to be without value. I would not suggest this book to anyone serious about the important responsibilities of a trustee.
4,This is no Krautrock,"I just have to write a review because people might think this CD sounds like Faust, Can, or some other Krautrock band from the 70s. This CD is definitely no Krautrock at all! But other than that, it's a very nice album. It's basically a ""best of"" of Jo Zimmermann's stuff - some of which was produced by one half of Mouse On Mars. Instrumental music with nice melodies - which all sound a little bit weird."
4,Some good stuff,I've been playing Judo for a few years now and this book really explained the different mindsets between do & jutsu. My only complaint & the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was a couple of the photos didn't have enough detail to clearly see the technique. The text explained everything pretty good but I still prefer illustrations. A minor complaint but I never give anything 5 stars anyway.
1,martial arts book sometime are not worth it,"If you are really looking into JuJutsu, don't buy this book. This book has black and whites of the ""take my wrist"" and 1-2-3 type moves. The author doesn't offer anything new to the topic of JJ that I haven't already gotten off of Wikipedia. This book is a dead zero if you want to know anything other than what kind of JJ this guy teaches. One more thing...the font is HUGE and double spaced in order to take up room enough to make pages. LOL."
3,Glad I kept my quality video of this,"I once put this movie out in a high quality VHS, from a SVHS master of an original 16mm film transfer. The picture and sound were five stars. Glad I kept it, because who wants to settle for an Alpha video dupe from an inferior copy."
3,"Nevre read the book, but remember seeing it on Saturday Morning Cartoons....","If your familiar with the old style of cartoons on Saturday Mornings, particualarly from 1980's to 1999's, you remember they had a section on books at your local library (to combat illeteriatcy). Anyways, this book was made into a cartoon, and i remember seeing it when i was like 8 yrs old and really liked it. I finally found the book it was based on, this book. Anyways, it sounds just like the cartoon version is. I guess i go get it to try and read it. Id rather prefer the cartoon version of this, but so far, this is only reference i ever found of it."
2,"great pictures, awful construction","This camera takes wonderful pictures, especially for the price...that is however if you can get the piece of crap to work. After this camera, I would never buy another mustek product. The outside casing is bulky and doesn't work half of the time. The dial wheel thing next to the lcd screen is supposed to be used to scroll through menu options and photos. It will only work when pushed down and to the side, and that only works about 30% of the time. The shutter doors get stuck closed and I have to use my finger nails to get them open. I have taken pictures that appeared to work, only to find out that they never took, this without any indication (I had plenty of memory and the battery was charged). I have never had these kinds of problems with any other type of digital camera I have used."
2,didnt get what i ordered,"I ordered the Fugi Finpix, but received a Musheui something or rather....because the birthdays were so close, i chose to keep both of the cameras, the first one broke in my hands as i was taking out of box, the second camera (i ordered 2, for a set of twins), worked irradically for 7-9 days, and then not at all.... the first camera was replaced by supersavers immediately, so iam in the middle of returning the second camera. The customer service at Supersaver is quick, and friendly, but iam not happy at having thought that i was buying a ""Fugi"" camera, which i own one for over 10 years now, I received a off the wall brand that works like an off the wall brand. So right now i am waiting for my second camera to return ....hope this lasts longer than the first two. Can they really do that....even my packing slip said i ordered fugi, but got Mutsaka blahblahblah....Not exactly excited. on the verge of frustration....a dubbed customer."
1,I order this in April 22,I order this dvd more than 2 month ago still not here I dont know if I have to just wait or what?
1,Poor Quality,Picture not good and missing sound at certain times. I felt like I was watching a poor bootleg. Not quite sure how CBS puts something out with this poor quality.
3,Wild and crazy!!!!,"I've always remembered Johnatan & Victoria as the loud couple, they always had to do something to get attention and boy did they had it. The dvd in general was a bit scrathed and it skipped some parts, it is not as good quality as the ones from seasons 1 & 7.Amazing Race Season 6 (2004-05)"
4,good season,Enjoyable and nostalgic to see one of the best seasons.The earlier seasons had more colorful characters.Quality of DVD was good
1,waste,complete and total waste of time and money....it was not required for my class and still sits in its package
3,top rap artist,I gave this 3 stars i like his other cd better. But i guess im in to punk rock and garage music. Still this is a great cd for rap fans. All my friends love him his flow of raps and the topics he raps about. If you a fan of paris and have his other material i would get this.
3,Old but still the most popular,"After four decades, this is still the most popular graduate text on recursion theory. I think the success is due to its stock of valuable material rather than the quality of writing. The style is dense, descriptions are overly brief, and explanations are poorly laid out. Proofs are brief and sketchy. Overall, it is just poor writing. Take a look at Odifreddi to see recursion theory from someone with a talent for readable prose.It says no previous logic course is assumed, but you actually need set theory and basic logic from the beginning. Also, coverage of the basics is cursory, so it would help to have done something like Cutland."
2,All time clasic,"Very difficult to read...very difficult exercises...and some have been proved wrong over the years...But, although its difficult i think is the best introduction to the subject for the time being..."
1,buyer beware!!!,"Dr Elrod is not a physician he is a former college professor who has found a better way to make a buck, by selling you books and vitamins and captitalizing on your pain and suffering! There is no scientific research to support his claims, to which he now adds ""Reversing Degenerative Diseases"". Go to his website in which he claims himself to be ""the foremost expert on fibromyalgia"" although he has never been published in any reputable scientific journal. Save your money!"
1,Not worth the money,"In recent years, there have been many fantastic books published on fibromyalgia. This book is not one of them! As a support group leader and educator in FMS, I do not believe this books helps in the understanding of this painful and disruptive syndrome."
4,Good information,"Whether or not you believe Fibromyalgia can really be reversed, this book provies a lot of information and some solutions that, if you try them, certainly can't hurt. I found it very useful and have recommended it to friends in my support groups online."
2,Slow going,"I've read a lot of books on Fibromyalgia; this one is a slow read for me. Good tips and such, but not something you can sit down and read through. Still worth the price!"
5,One of the absolute best books I've ever read!,"This is the first book I can recall reading where the closer I got to the end, the slower I read because the thought of it ever ending was just too painful!Bill Bryson has an incredible skill with the anecdote, and I learned more of the everyday and trivial aspects of America's history in this book than in anything else I've ever read or thumbed through.Anyone who finds entymology fascinating or has a penchant for history will count their pre-Made in America days empty and wasted and will be forced to start counting their birthdays over again from when they began at page one."
3,"Occasionally entertaining, but not a real history","I was disappointed with this book, not so much on its merit but because it was not what I was expecting. I was hoping for a more scholarly history of how the English language developed in America. This is really more like a loose collection of historical anecdotes that explain how certain words or phrases came into American English, the kind of ""and that's why we call it _____"" stories. Some of these stories are interesting bits of Americana, but this book does very little to explain how or why American English differs from British, Australian, or New Zealand English. Not a bad book, just make sure it's what you are looking for."
5,Fascinating social history,"This book is far less a book on language than it is a social history of the United States as expressed in the langauge of the American people. As such it is a fascinating look at the history of some of the more mundane or overlooked aspects of American history - the good stuff, the juicy stories, the stuff you don't learn in history class. Written in Bryson's peculiarly witty style, and from his particular perspective (that of an American who had spent just about his entire adult life living and working in Britain), this book is a uniquely entertaining read. My favorite of Bryson's books."
3,"Typical Bryson (i.e. hilarious and well-researched), but his only to not fully captivate me.","In typical Bryson style, Made in America is a comprehensive look at the evolution of American English and the culture surrounding much of the evolution.However, unlike his travel books or A Brief History, this book struggled to captivate me. I blame the many lists of words that are present in the book (I occasionally skipped pages at a time) and the fact that this book caters for an American audience, not a general audience.A pity. This is Bryson's only book that I haven't thoroughly enjoyed, nay, loved!"
3,America with mixed emotions,"It's hard to know how to take Bill. He's American yet her seems too have an odd prediliction for criticising and belittling America. He writes well, is very funny and interesting yet after reading any of his books about America you are left with a strange (sour?) taste in your mouth. I've always been suspicious of Americans who go to live somewhere else and then decide to criticise their home country. All that notwithstanding the intelligent reader will sift the dross from the gloss and find this book an enjoyable read."
3,It's ok,OMG...... It's ok but I did t expect so much...... Well ....... Not sure how I feel .... I started reading & gave up.....
3,A re-hash of other people's originality . . .,"This popular history of the American version of the language is better written than most of his other books -- even though, as usual, he spends half his time in digressions. First, there are several chapters about the early history of North American settlement, with language covered almost as an afterthought, then several chapters on our early national history, then on the westward movement, then on the effects of immigration on the development of English, and so on. Later chapters cover the influences of politics and war, of technological change, and of advertising and the movies. All this is interesting, in a anecdotal way, but those reviewers who touted this book as ""scholarly"" are dead wrong. He scatters lots of words through each chapter but seldom discusses their provenance. There are a great many footnotes and a lengthy bibliography, but not one bit of originality."
1,Self plagiarism,"I started this book yesterday. Today I tossed it across the room in disgust. Mr. Bryson's bias for things English and against things American once again rears it's ugly head. If he ever gets over this malady he would have something useful to say. Circumlocution, as Ambrose Bierce said, is a literary trick whereby the writer who has nothing to say breaks it gently to the reader. Mr. Bryson has added nothing of value with this book. Everything he had to say on the topic was in Mother Tongue. If you have any interest in this area stick with Mother Tongue, it's the much better choice."
1,Made in America,"I am so sorry I hadn't taken the time to read the customer's reviews of Made in America and The Lost Continent, prior to buying them. Frankly, I'm not sure which of these two books is more disappointing. The only thing I was able to take away from them was the idea that Bill Bryson thinks hammering and bashing anything North American (USA only) is considered extremely good fun and humorous."
1,Crap,More about history than bills usual banter. Not impressed at all. I did not get very far with this as was very slow going
3,I'm not that much the etymologist,"But I will grant Bill Bryson has done his homework. He goes into the weeds from my perspective a number of times, but I found many parts quite interesting. Items like how word choices were made for the Declaration of Independence, how the pilgrims managed to find an English speaking Indian and many, many more insights."
5,"Witty, fun, erudite","This is by far my favorite book by Bill Bryson. I bought this for my wife who is a devotee of word derivations, but found that it sated my interest in history, and also provided a multitude of fun, and interesting, facts about popular culture.Unlike most of Bryson's works this is a serious scholarly effort, but is written in an entertaining rather than academic fashion. Also, unlike other Bryson works this is less opinionated, and uncharacteristically celebrates the many fascinating and admirable factors in the evolution of a distinct American culture.While his typical sardonic humor comes through it is more understated, and not at all unkind.A fun and educational book that you will want to leisurely enjoy a chapter at a time, and not necessarily in sequential order."
4,"Very engaging for the non-linguist, and entertaining too!","Bryson has an engaging style of writing that piques one's interest in the origins of American English. While not for the hard core linguist, it answers many questions the casual observer might have. Small technical errors (Embarass is in Minnesota, not Wisconsin) and omissions (Sears and Roebuck started in North Redwood Falls, MN), it is none the less a darned good read, and a great way of learning more about the origins of the words and phrases we use daily in the US."
5,Packed with some of the most interesting trivia I've ever re,This book is packed with some of the most interesting trivia I've ever read on Americana and our language. Presented in an easy flowing style with panache and humour
5,Another delight!,"I have loved every Kirkman book I have read, and this one is no exception. I really like her stream-of-consciousness writing style, because it makes me understand the characters more. In reality, we don't think in complete sentences and organized paragraphs. So I respect an author with the guts to write the way people think.I liked Elene a lot, and I admired her strength to do what she had to do to stay alive. I also liked that she was willing to risk the life she fought for to help Berg, even though she didn't understand why she felt so connected to him, and despite thinking he could not love a fallen woman.I loved how protective Berg was of her, even though he thought she would never love him because of his scarred face.A great tale of hurt, comfort, war and love. Kirkman never disappoints."
2,"good hero, but hard-to-read-style","I liked the historical setting, and the hero was likeable. The main problem I had with this book is the style. In scenes between the two main characters there is too much description, mostly problematic because it's describing the same thing every time! I already KNOW that's how the heroine feels! Let me know when she feels differently!Then when you get to the battle scene, there is an inverse problem: it is brushed over so briefly, there really isn't any sense of danger or tension.Gorgeous cover though."
2,Hard to follow,"I originally bought this because I'm a huge fan of Viking romances and the cover art was beautiful. But as I started reading, I had a hard time following. The writing style is very very choppy. It stopped and started so much I got a headache. I found myself skipping around trying to get to any good parts. Finally, I gave up and just read the ending. Not a keeper."
5,amazing,This is an amazing book. This will help anyone who is going through any for emotional rollercoaster from lack of love from their father or love in general. It help mend those broken piece and help you live Again
4,Great read!,I am leaving for my second trip to Papua New Guinea in little under a week. I found Salak's book to be a great read! I agree with another reviewer that her introspective thoughts became a bit redundant but all in all the book flowed well and was very interestingI would definately-- and have already-- recommended this to friends.
3,Not bad but not great,"This was easy to install, and had pleanty of capability to support my 32-in flat panel TV. My 2 complaints are that it is not very low-profile (the TV sticks out from the wall quite a bit and is unsightly when viewed from the side), and the support rails are very large and end up blocking several connectors on my TV. I needed to plug into the TV side connectors for the DVD (could not access the rear plugs), and could only use one of the two audio plugs. Overall, I would say it does the job, it is just a little awkward and may block some of your TV's connectors."
3,"It's ok, but not great","The price was good on this mount, $59 at the time, and it does the job. The frame is pretty flimsy and one of the lag bolts broke as I was screwing it into a wall stud. The included drywall anchors are junk.Once installed the mount looks pretty good and seems sturdy. You definitely get what you pay for with this product but it does get the job done."
3,"Does not fit Vizio 37XL (20"" mount)","Seems sturdy but the width listed is for the whole unit. The actual mount width this unit can accomodate is 18"" or less. (18"" would be pretty tight, I think). it seemed sturdy and simple to install."
5,Great Book,This book has been extremely helpful as I've prepared to move to Sydney with my fiance. It's very well written with many useful suggestions and insights. I highly recommend it!
3,A telling tale of the courage of a young woman.,"This is the story of Thanea, daughter of Loth, King of the Southern Picts. It is a story of her courage to hold to her Christian convictions despite the wishes of her heathen father. The novel also tells the story of the birth and rise of one of Scotland's greatest saints, St. Mungo, founder of Glasgow. In the Dark Ages, when the stories of strong women are largely ignored, the story of Thanea is an enlightening and inspiring tale of conviction and courage."
3,A mixed bag,"As a glimpse into the world of ballet, the novel succeeded quite well. As a mystery, however, it was a flop, in my opinion. I guessed the identity of the murderer way too early. The love interest seemed pretty tepid as well. To the reader who wondered why the author went on about Juliet's yeast infection, there IS a connection between this and the solution to the mystery!"
1,DOA,"While the details about the ballet are interesting, the plot shuffles along. Nothing much happens and it takes pages upon pages to realize that not much is going to happen. It's more a book about the insides of a ballet company than a murder mystery. The characters are not well drawn out and the dialogues feel stilted. If you are interested in ballet, there are better books. If you are looking for a good mystery, skip this one."
5,Absolutly Wonderful,This book is the first book that I have read that makes me feel like I am there standing beside the characters. It is a very well written book that I would recommend to anyone who enjoys a great love story. It shows overall that we can pick ourselves up at our lowest.
2,disappointed,"I was disappointed by this book. With such rave reviews, this book seemed like a wonderful find. Although, as the book's story drew to a close, Ms. Shapiro's ability to ""pull me in"" as a reader increased, overall the story lacked depth. Her straightforward narration, and undeveloped use of tension and anticipation, made it difficult to keep reading in hopes that the story would get better. The major conflicts/events, such as Ryan's death, were simply stated, and then described, draining the potential emotional power from this pivotal part of the whole book. This was the first book by Ms. Shapiro I have read. Maybe some of her other books are better."
4,such wonderful sibling rivilary...,"Josephine did it to me again - I'm always on the edge, can't put her books down - once again she shocked me, such a lovely way of writing the most horrible feelings and actions of the human animal - women may be the weaker sex but don't get on the wrong side of ""a lady""."
3,Worthwhile Sophomore Effort,"I thought Sin was a crafty follow-up to Damage. Not as poignant, but a good read nonetheless. Some second novels are flat compared to the author's first release, but this is not the case with Sin. It is well worth your time although I do concede that it has an overall soap opera feel to it. The place names, plot, and characters can seem ostentatious at times so prepare to make at least a small suspension of disbelief. Hart continues to explore the ideas of jealousy, obession and passion in Sin but not with the same effectiveness as with Damage. Overall, I would suggest Sin as an excellent rainy day, relax and have fun read."
1,disappointing,"After ""Damage"" which is one of the best books I read in years, I couldn't wait to read another Josephine Hart. When I found ""Sin"" I bought it and started to read ... and got very disappointed. The whole novel through I was waiting for a chance for the good: I didn't like the unrealistic, arrogant, self-centred (main-)character(s), I was bored by yet another story in snobbist english high-society and where ""Damage"" was fascinatingly sensual and destructive, ""Sin"" is just a ""would-be"" but doesn't get close. I can only agree with the reader from Edgartown, Mass.: it was the worst second novel I ever read."
4,"Minimal, Dark and Disturbing","Unlike some of the other reviewers I have not seen Damage, or read Josephine Hart's other books. I came to it with an open mind.It is a dark tale of a woman's obsession with her beautiful adopted older sister, and her resentment and growing hate for the beautiful, tall and lean, blond Elizabeth. The prose is precise and jagged. At time disjointed, but always beautiful.I found the description of Ruth's stealing personal items from her sister and squirreling them away and bringing them out later as fetishes when the need took her, piquantly sordid.The Lake incident was heartbreaking and I had to stop reading and compose myself. Tragedy follows tragedy and we see Ruth gradually taking on the identity of Elizabeth. Disturbing at times, eventually becoming an emotional car smash that one continues to read in utter fascination."
4,Great baseball book,Must read for anyone who wantts to know what iit is like to try to make it in baseball's minor leagues
5,An excellent story of unrealized potential,"Sports Illustrated called this book one of the twenty ""must have"" sports books in your collection. After reading this book I can see why. Pat Jordan does a phenomenal job of detailing his experience. He begins as a brash, cocky young phenom receiving a large bonus, and winds up languishing on a ""D"" class minor league team and wondering ""why?"". Jordan writes about his minor league experience with such detail that you feel that you are there with him, experiencing the frustrations of desiring to move ahead and go to ""the show"". As a former athletic department tutor at a large university, I can tell you that many, many athletes with the greatest potential wound up going nowhere. Sometimes, the line between success and failure is a thin one."
5,ONE OF THE GREATEST SPORTS BOOK OF ALL TIME,"""A False Spring"" is so good I cannot do it justice here. It is, along with ""Ball Four"", ""The Suitors of Spring"" (also by Pat Jordan) and ""Bo: Pitching and Wooing"" by Maury Allen, one of the best baseball books ever written. This book describes minor league baseball, the hopes and dreams of a young athlete, youthful sex, raunchiness, crushing disappointment, and Americana. I read this book and memorized it, then went off to play minor league ball myself and totally lived all of it. My experiences in the Cardinal and A's organization did not resemble Jordan's, they rhymed. This book tells the story of thousands of young hopefuls who live amongst us, and many more of us can relate to it than can relate to the superhuman life and accomplishments of Barry Bonds."
1,It is all rubbish!,"""the time period between 7 o'clock in the evening and 7 in the next morning is when tied hands come out most frequently"". That is what the author writes at the very beginning of his book. You see how ridiculous it is! Besides this, there are many other ""INTERESTING"" things inside. Don't play with this system, unless you are a very lucky guy!"
1,Terrible!,"If you like books that don't make any sense, then by all means buy this book. It is bad enough that studies have shown that it is nearly impossible to gain an edge a baccarat through card-counting (including one written by Edward O. Thorp), but this book will instill a sense of false confidence in anyone foolish enough to believe that Q's theory is true. If the systems in this book worked, the rules of baccarat would either have to be changed or the game would cease to exist. It is amazing that a publishing company would even bother to publish such drivel!"
4,Managing Children's Services in the Public Library,"I originally bought this as a text for a grad course and have kept this as near my desk as possible since. Fasick covers all aspects of managing library services for children in an easy-to-read, step-by-step format.This book is useful to school media personnel as well as public librarians. A great reference for anyone who works with children in a public setting."
2,Rife with distracting typoes,"Easy-to-read, yes, but distracting because the text is rife with typoes! So disappointing. I think this text would be better if geared toward undergrads or even high-school age students. Too simplistic for graduate-level LIS courses."
3,what is this bootsy?,too techno for me give it 3 stars only because i'm a huge bootsy and p-funk fan. this sounds like daft punk remixed.
3,Secret War,This is not an entertaining DVD. It is about secret things that went on during WWII. Some of which are very sad. The incompetence of some in authority makes one wonder how the Allies won the war. I expect many on the Axis side were as incompetent as well. Listen to this DVD and be informed.
4,tunafish,"This album really made my respect to chali 2na bigger. the last 10 tracks are kicking it, I can`t get tired of it.I am really looking forward to his next projekt ""Fish outta sea"""
5,Delicious snack,I tasted this snack at my local pub and found it tasty... much better than chips or other mixes. I was told it was sold in Sam's club and Wegman's for $18 per 30 0z container. Bought it from Utz in a 4 pack for $41.00.Each piece has a different taste and texture...Could not ask for a more delicious snack or a better price. Thank you Utz!
5,Pub Mix is addicting!!!,"I found this mix at the Ft Myer Commissary. I looked for this product last time I visited the commissary and could not find it. So here I am online looking and found it here. I could eat this all day. I've tried several different snack mixes, but most have too many pretzels. This has a very nice balance of flavors and textures -- and not a lot of pretzels. I'm stocking up!!"
3,Now see,"; the problem with this mix -- and to mind, the only problem! -- is the inclusion of one or two slightly sugary little... things. This provides an experience of, well, repugnance, at least for me; I've never been one to mix the sodium and the glucose, and this surely ain't converting me. ESPECIALLY when they're in the same bite/handful. Ugh.Otherwise, this mix is really yummy. It all tastes rather waxy, and I'm sure is not the healthiest food in the world (though you could do worse), but its a well combined mixture.But then again, I've got to sort of work my way through at a crawling pace, because I must grab a handful, and then separate the rejects. Maybe I'm just neurotic, or maybe they made A FATAL MISTAKE AND SHOULD BE PUNISHED.Oh yeah, like the last reviewer, I too got 'em at Costco."
5,Nice Piano,"This CD has a very good feeling to it. The songs are mostly piano solos, but there are a few tunes with light accompaniment, and Neal Davis also plays vibes and guitar on one song. The whole package is beautiful from the cover to the last song. Highly recommended for anyone who is familiar with Davis's piano work."
5,Good Introduction to Italian Mafia,"I was a little skeptical about buying a historically based book by an unknown author, but as soon as I started reading it, I was hooked. The book is full of interesting stories, facts and insights into the Italian Mafia. I have read many books on the subject and can say that this is a great addition to anyone's mafia section."
4,Interesting,"really good book wiht background on the historical development of the Mafia, was particualtily interested in how far it reaches into Italian life. written in a good style, much like his book on italian food from a couple of years ago."
5,Important book,"Great to book to learn and understand the mafia problem in Italy and the States in a vivid and readable manner since the origin to nowdays, the service great..."
4,Educational,"My first mafia book. They way i see it, it provides the readers with a solid picture on what the Mafia is about.It is educational based on collective facts. Back to the basics i would call it. Sikelia as the mother land deserves much attention in the literature and this book is definitely going for that. The locus of attention is in situations from an old era but evidently their effect is manifest in various ways today. Good stuff"
3,Who is BP Medical Supplies?,"I apparently purchased this item from BP Medical Supplies. No paperwork came with the item. The name BP Medical Supplies does not appear on the envelope as the sender, in fact a man's name is down as the sender. The item was not packaged as I expected it to be if coming from 'medical supplies'. The item was in an open clear plastic bag inside a brown padded envelope. The item does appear to be in working order."
3,"A new writing style, this is in a category all its own","I like my books written in a more easy to follow style, but I liked the fact that Estleman seemed to have an insight into Pat Garrett's innermost mind. I can easily see Garrett feeling just this way. Estleman did a good job with what he started out to do. BUt I disagree with the statement from Kirkus Reviews about him having no rival in evoking the southwest. Kirby Jonas, whom critics call The New Louis L'AMour, is no doubt the best when it comes to describing and bringing country to life. Jonas also writes in an easier to follow style, and I would recommend his books to any fans of the west. But don't pass this Estleman book up if you like Garrett and Bonney."
3,Not a casual read,"Absolutely gorgeous imagery, but any sense of storytelling gets mired in the dense prose. Sentences are long and complex, and by the time you get to the end of them, you forget anything specific happening. All you're left with are images, and though they're beautiful, it's not enough to engage me into any kind of profound reading experience."
1,Boring and hard to follow,"The secondary characters were poorly develped and the story line was hard to follow, if there was a story line. I wouldn't even rate it a one star. The book was a complete bore."
3,Not what's shown...,Ordered this one thinking I'd be getting one that matched one I had as I was planning on using them as heavy duty canopy poles...what came was a cheap yellow plastic version without a bottom end cap and with a bulky locking mechanism that is way less effective and user friendly than the one I already had...was leaving on a trip the next day so spray painted grey and decided to live with it...but come on Amazon...ship what you show/sell
2,anna and thr king,I did not like the beginning scenes during which Jodi Foster attitude and behavior was extremely Arrogant and Demanding and Domineering. It was so intense that I had to skip the part. I feel that she did not represent the characteristics of an English woman or educator during that time period.
2,Boring,"I bought this DVD some years ago, because I like Jodi Foster and I loved The King and I. It was a mistake. Jodi showed no spirit in this film and she acted as though she wished it were over as soon as it started. Either she was directed badly or she was just not right for the film.Not much else to say. After seeing The King and I with it's beautiful music and great acting, all I can say is that I fell asleep watching this one."
3,Anna and the King of Siam,"This movie is amusing, but there's something missing. It's not bad, it's just that the chemistry between the leads doesn't exist and the script could have been better."
2,Miscast,"This movie was a disappointment. The King and I is one of my favorite movies, so I really looked forward to seeing Anna and the King. Although I like Jodie Foster as an actress and have enjoyed many of her movies, this one fell flat. No chemistry between her and the King. Zero chemistry."
2,Boring spectacle/dull romance.,This is the fifth incarnation of this story (three have been produced within the last few years - the first two being truly dreadful animated films) and for the life of me I can't understand why film makers think this story so fascinating they have to cram endless versions into our gullets. Of the three live action versions this is the least satisfying. There is no tension between our protagonists - they get along famously from the start. We are subjected to two and a half hours of boredom amid lush photography and deservedly Academy Award nominated Art Direction and Costume Design. This is one where you go out humming the sets. Stick with the original Dunne/Harrison version of the classic R&H version with Kerr/Brynner.
5,Extra Features,"(....) really doesn't mention all the extra ""goodies"" that they've encluded in this Special Edition of Anna and the King, so I was thrilled to discover a good two hours of behind-the-scenes features, a trailor, music video, and more! The DVD quality is excellent, very sharp and clear, with a very well-done enter-menu feature, and deleted scenes, including an extention of the ""White Elephant"" sequence, and the ""Prologue"" and ""Epilogue"" scenes. The six featurettes are pretty repetative - if you've seen one, you've seen them all, but the interviews with Foster and Yun-Fat are pretty darn cool. All in all, a wonderful DVD from Fox... and an excellent film. If you enjoy epic romances, simple tales made exceptional by breathing romance and a passionate, gorgeous backdrop, with sets made perfect down to the tiniest detail, a film that will make you laugh, and make you cry... Anna and the King is it! The movie of the year! Don't miss it... and don't miss this edition!"
5,Anna and the King,"This is an excellent movie which I have watched on numerous occasions and will watch many more times in the future. Jodie Foster is excellent in her role. The whole concept of the King falling in love with ""1"" woman when he had so many wives really touched me. It was a true love story."
3,Uncomfortable tale of changing eras,"""Anna and the King"" is full of beautiful Cinematography, competent acting and some moving points of story line but overall it missed continuity.The whole romantic subplot between Anna and the King was either far fetched, or Anna, wasn't the kind of woman that the story leads you to believe.The plot of the war between Burma and Siam was much more interesting, but the ""British as bad guy"" theme, although likely true, came across as a bit ham fisted and lost credulity with me. Much more interesting than that, was the view of changing cultures at crucial turning points, progressive or traditional, begs the question ""What is necessary to survive/ if we do that will we still be who we are?"" This movie has a couple of heart wrenching examples. Today the whole world deals with similar questions.So the deal is for me, this is a movie that you have to be in a mood for.3*"
3,Special Edition is anamorphic widescreen,"The special edition is, in fact, anamorphic widescreen. I originally ordered a copy of this movie which was labeled as widescreen, but the DVD itself was full screen. I ordered another copy and it was indeed anamorphic widescreen.I had to edit my original review--but I can't change the original rating! I give this movie 5 stars."
4,What A Movie~!,"I am sorry to all those who fell this movie is boring or not very good,but in my opionion I would say this movie is very good. This movie is adapted from the not forgotton THE KING AND I. In this movie it is pretty the same plot. Only the story is changed a little bit. For one there is no singing. I won't give away everything so I will just say I love the way this movie goes. Anna is an ambitious women who is not afraid to stand up to anyone. She defys all odds. She comes to teach the King's many childern in school. While she is there she changes the way Siam is and the King of course. As the King's prime minister said,""She think she is equal to a man!"" The King replys,""No she thinks she is equal to a king."" Jodie Foster and Chow-Yun-Fat are great together on the screen. The costumes are wonderful!I would say if you love movies that make you feel good this one! Watch as Anna forever changes the King. And the King changes her."
1,The King and I Admirers Will Be Bored,This film was a real let down. Jodie Foster was wasted in a familiar tale that wasn't told the way we remember it. Deborah Kerr and Yul Brynner keep their titles of Anna and the King.
2,So-So,"Very grand, very beautiful. Historically inaccurate. Thai-language skills are horrible. Chow Yun Fat doesn't even look Thai."
5,Wonderful Anna and the King,This is the most beautiful of all the Anna and the King movies ever made and I saw the first one with Yul Brenner on stage 57 years ago.
2,Disappointing,If you are a fan of the original movie with Yul Brenner and Debra Kerr I think this remake will be a let down. Don't waste your time.
3,Not authentic,"An excellent story, well told but there were almost no Thai/Siamese people in the cast. Another example of arrogant producers assuming that an audience can not tell the difference between races of people or that they do not care. A scan of the cast list, reveals that most of the cast were in fact Chinese. Does it matter? Yes, to me it does, when I watch a movie about Thailand, I expect to see Thai people, little wonder that the movie was not a hit in Thailand, I imagine that they are insulted by it. I was surprised by Jodie Foster in this role, I have always liked her but never imagined her as an English woman, she was most convincing."
4,Loved It! Loves stories don't get much better than this.,"Ignore the critics and see for yourself what a wonderful, truly lovely story and movie this really was. Set against the backdrop of what is now Thailand, this beautiful story unfolds of star-crossed lovers whose sheer passion, respect, and admiration for each and their inability to display it makes this story all the more compelling. A must see for any true romantic!"
5,See this Movie!,This is an absolutely beautiful film - a feast for the eyes. Chow Yun-Fat is excellent and the story is lots of fun. This and the Sixth Sense were my two favorite movies of 1999!
3,Convenient,I felt this was a convenient way to get a movie.I do think the price was too high.I don't think I'll rent from Amazon until their price comes down.
3,Enjoyable revenge romp,"The movie doesn't have a complicated plot or deep, dynamic characters. That said, it's quite a good watch for what it is. It's primarily a revenge thriller and it does that job quite well. The burning need for retribution is an extremely powerful force in the human psyche and this movie plays on that emotion quite effectively. It's not a movie that I want to keep, but I really enjoyed it for an evening watch."
4,"A fun, enjoyable action movie",Liam is a soft-spoken bad-ss as he does anything and everything to get his daughter back from the bad guys.
5,great movie,Really interesting movie to watch. Couldn't wait to see what happened. Lots of action that kept me interested the whole time.
4,Surprise Thriller!,I love this movie! Who knew Liam Neeson would be SUCH an action star! He's really good and VERY believable. It also has a good story. The action is pretty much non stop. I would definitely recommend this movie. It's a fun movie.
2,Don't bother,run of the mill thriller that makes no sense if you watch closely. and liam neeson just isn't an action hero. sorry.
2,Neeson as Comic Book Superhero?,The story line doesn't come close to being plausible. The action scenes are absurdly exaggerated. It's hard to get into this film because it's so silly.
2,PLEASE TAKE ME --AWAY,"I have eagerly been waiting for New Years Day and boring TV to watch this film. Boo-hoo. I could only get through the first 40 minutes before pulling out my hair. And I like Liam! But in this film there was much bad acting, overblown Hollywood style drama and characters I could not like--especially the daughter and her mother. I finally turned it off rather than torture myself further."
2,bad story line,Liam is an amazing actor that usually chooses roles that allow him to flex his acting muscles. This is not one of them.
3,Empty Nest Syndrome,"Despite my being a big fan of Luc Besson and enjoying Liam Nesson's work, this film just never gelled for me. Whole lotta action, whole lotta stereotypes, no particularly interesting characters, no character development at all. You know all along what's gonna happen and what he's gonna do, it happens and he does it."
2,A predictable implausible revenge flick,"There wasn't much new or interesting about this film. Very predictable and therefore pretty boring. Very violent. Very implausible action scenes. I'd rather watch the Bourne movies repeatedly than see this again. The plot is very thin, basically an excuse for Neeson to act out revenge fantasies. He takes on ten guys at a time and doesn't suffer a scratch. The scenes of strung-out girls forced into prostitution are disturbing, not appropriate at all for teens."
1,Horrendous,"I'd give it 1 1/2 stars, because there are certainly worse films, but it doesn't deserve 2 stars. I've never been convinced by this actor, and I find him quite creepy. He's awful in this, but I started to feel sorry for him...then I didn't, because he accepted the role, right? The whole thing is 100% improbable, predictable, and full of prop room basics and characters from Central Casting. The pop music diva angle to the storyline is pitiful and insulting to anyone beyond American Idol intellect. I was afraid the ending was going to be just what it was, but when it actually happened all I could say was ""of course."" Totally bogus, move on folks, nothing to see here."
1,Buyer Beware!,"After a month, I neither received this dvd, nor did I receive any response to 3 emails inquiring about it. Is this person still in business? And if not, an email would have been nice so I could know to purchase it elsewhere."
2,Thought this would be a LOT better,"Disappointing vigilante film that wastes a great actor like Liam Neeson. I'm sorry, but he just doesn't cut it as an action hero. And in this day of great action movies like the Bourne Trilogy or 'Casino Royale', or even 'Shoot 'Em Up', there's no reason for this film to be as lame as it actually is."
4,Much better than I expected!,"A co-worker suggested this movie saying it was better than most were giving it credit for and I was hesitant to take his word on it, as this co-worker has suggested other movies to my hubby and me that I ended up really disliking (My Super Ex-Girlfriend for example). But I gave in and gave it a try as I do like Liam Neeson, but I wasn't expecting much in the end.The plot was a little weak and the movie overall was a bit formulaic. I didn't care for Maggie Grace as the daughter, and felt her acting was a bit lame in this movie. And I definitely wasn't expecting Liam Neeson to be so kick-butt in this movie and I was surprised at how much I really liked this film by the end! It's a good guy takes revenge on the bad guy flick and Liam excelled at it in this movie. And that is really why this movie is so good. Much, much better than I thought it would be and I am glad that I took the chance and saw it. You should too!"
3,An action-packed but unbelievable thriller,"A young girl, Kim Mills (Maggie Grace), sets off for Europe to follow a pop group on tour. She is accompanied by her friend Amanda (Katie Cassidy). At the airport in Paris she is enticed by a young man to share a taxi to her apartment. Later, that same man has thugs kidnap Kim and Amanda to exploit them for prostitution. Now Kim's father, Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson) is an ex-CIA man and is immediately on the case. The rest of the film is about Bryan's attempts to track down the kidnappers. There's lots of action as Mills demolishes all the Albanian and Islamic opposition as he rescues his girl, but the number of victims he manages to execute while hardly sustaining a scratch himself is scarcely believable. There is a sub-plot about Kim wanting to become a pop singer herself, but there are not really many surprises in the main or sub-plot."
4,Required watching for teenage daughters,Eye opener for teenage girls to understand why we protect them! This movie teaches about the ever growing sex trafficking industry.
4,Gripping throughout,Some great lines for the hero and non-stop action when this movie is at its best. Family conflict and hugs ... not so much.
5,Taken is excellent!,"One of my favorite movies with Liam Neeson in it! Of course batman tops it, but it is a close second!"
2,Movie was not what I hoped for,"All violence and his point of view, she is in the beginning and the end and you have no idea of her side of the story."
3,It was decent.,"A solid action movie. I run hot and cold with Mr. Liam Neeson, but he was decent in this movie."
3,Extended version????,How can this be the extended version when the running time is 90 minutes and the theatrical version is 94 minutes?????
3,Brainless Fun,"No surprises here. Suspend belief as Liam Neeson courageously, methodically, and efficiently tracks down nasty Eurotrash and eliminates them with nary a scratch until the end. See him arrive home victorious, with no mention of any repercussions from shooting the wife of a French Big Shot to get his point across. I guess the French were all, ""Oh, you crazy American!"" and knew it had to be done. Predictable, yet fun to watch- who doesn't like to see an Albanian electrocuted with a home made electric chair? Perfect set up for a sequel- they get the ex-wife next. In the third one, they take his faithful dog, Shutzengel. To make it interesting, the dog will be carrying Atomic Secrets in his collar."
4,ACTION PACKED,"Do you like Jason Bourne movies? If you do, get TAKEN. You won't be disappointed. The movie is basically a 50 year old Jason Bourne (played by Liam Neeson) trying to save his daughter. The movie is intense and action packed. Plus, it really makes you wonder what kind of world we really live in."
5,Born Identity X 10,"Awesome movie,This movie is my new very favorite movie.A lot of the action scenes seems familar from the Born identity.But this movie takes the born identity and turns it up ten notches,But yet its more in a mystery thriller suspence mode.It takes a movie about a daddy and daughter relationship and thrusts it into high speed killing action once his daughter gets ubducted.awesome movie take my advice if you love the born identity and action movies,dont rent this movie,BUY IT.Youll love it.."
3,Fun and Mindless,"As revenge movies go, this doesn't compare to great revenge classics like ""Death Wish"", ""Rolling Thunder"" or ""Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia"". If you haven't seen any of those, buy them and not this. However, this film held my attention and it was great to see a big sensitive actor like Liam carrying such a dark brutal story. The action is just a bit too unrealistic. We see Liam beating up five guys at once who are all half his age, but we never see him pause to catch his breath once. I don't think he ever bleeds or bruises at any time. This is a shame, because seeing Liam's character at risk would have drawn the viewer deeper into the story. Liam Neeson is an exceptional actor who can easily play vulnerability. But his vulnerable side is never explored. All we get is a loud bone-crushing superhero. Still, as bad as it is, I enjoyed ""Taken"" and will probably watch it again someday."
1,Doesn't even work.,"Took the Blu Ray out of the packaging and then put it in my PS3 to watch it, and after approx. 10 min my PS3 had not recognized that there was a disc inside it. I tested it out on my laptop which has a Blu Ray player and my laptop itself did not even recognize a disc inside the disc drive. All of my Blu Ray systems are up to date. This product had no chance of working."
1,PS3 won't read the Blu-ray,"I purchased Taken on Amazon.com shipped and sold from them. My PS3 SlimPS3 320GB Uncharted 3 BundleandPlayStation 3 60GB Systemwouldn't read the disc at all yet they both will read other Blu-ray's, DVD's, and PS3 Games fine. This maybe could a bad batch that Amazon has. I am going to Best Buy tomorrow morning and buy a copy from there. I will update this review once I test Taken. Amazon.com customer service has really understanding of this issue."
2,Satisfied but not happy,"The disc played but the DVD Box and disc itself were most definitely not in ""very good"" condition. The case was broken in multiple spots."
3,Good Movie - deserves 3 1/2 stars really,"Understand that I give 5 stars to things like Gone With the Wind, Forrest Gump, Midnight Cowboy, Crash, Pulp Fiction, Deliverance.This movie is entertaining, full of action, and a genuinely good watch. I recommend it."
3,Eye opener,Good movie if you had watched the first one so you knew the background but not fantastic because it was pretty predictable and somewhat corny in parts. The mom was not very believable in her part. The story line about human trafficking was a good way to bring that subject into discussion with our family tho
5,most satisfying ending ever,"This movie is like a runaway train----relentless, unflinching, brutal (to the bad guys)and intense. The suspense is higher than the body count and this movie has without a doubt the most satisfying ending EVER."
5,Intense,Shows the strength of a father's love what can actually happen when any kind of threat gets between a father and his child.
4,Top notch action film,"I never thought to see Liam Neeson in this good an action/ suspense movie, but it works on all levels. Very entertaining you will not be disappointed."
1,wish I could watch it!!!,This blu ray will not play in the 3 blu ray players I have in my house.... I'm very disappointed I have to go to the trouble of returning it.
2,"Good movie, terrible quality","I really enjoyed the movie, but unfortunately the quality was terrible. I have a high speed internet connection and watched it through my Sony Bravia smart tv. The quality was not just far from HD, it was far from regular quality. It was pixelated and hard to view. Oh well, won't be using Amazon Instant View anymore."
5,One of the best movies! ^__^,I am in love with this movie! <3 It is one of my favorites. Liam Neeson does a fantastic performance. A man who doesn't stop until he gets what he came for. I just can't wait for the second part to come out this year! =D
4,see this movie,"I knew the core plot of this movie. Yet when I watched I was drawn in completely. The action is sudden, raw and real - it reminded me of The Bourne Identity. They should have cut the final scene, as there was perfect feeling of satisfaction at the moment when the father frees his daughter, after squashing every cockroach of a man that stood in his way."
3,Predictable,"Certianly nothing new or original here. The plot is contrived and predictable. Neeson makes the file worth watching, however. Once you get past the first 30 minutes where they make a poor attempt and developing the characters and building conflict, the movie kicks into high gear. At least they don't make any lame attempts at making the movie more than it really is: 60 minutes of Neeson taking out everybody who gets in his way. Nothing cute or clever here, just methodical execution of all the bad guys."
4,Taken,"I find the story very interesting.The actors are very good, particularlyLiam Neeson is perfect. In my opinion it is one of the best thrillers."
4,Lots of ACTION...,"SPOILER ALERT * * *SPOILER ALERT * * *The movie moved along at a good pace, with lots of actionHowever, the daughter was non grateful before, during and afterI was so disappointed; with as much as he, the father, did for her...This affected the way I felt about the movieThe movie was full of action, but the daughter was pathetic!!!"

2,Did it have to be this dumb?,"Liam Neeson is a good actor and the fact that he seems to be taking the role seriously makes this film better than it ought to be, but it's still basically garbage. Well-filmed, tightly-edited garbage. All the dialogue, every character who is introduced -- nothing is handled with even the slightest, faintest hint of subtlety or nuance, as though the screenplay was written by a 12 year old who's never been outdoors."
2,Stars for Neeson and Grace,"The stars are for Liam Neeson and Maggie Grace, but not so much for the film. It's a standard action/international thriller--nothing that has not been done a thousand times before. Shooting an innocent woman in the arm to make her husband talk does not make me admire the so-called hero in the story, and neither does his leaving a man to be electrocuted repeatedly until the power eventually goes off. Yes, I get that he is trying to rescue his daughter, but if it were so easy, there wouldn't be so many women still hidden away, as they are right now.There's also no indication that he was going to notify the French police or Interpol about all the captive women he saw. Sure, they could be moved, but at least there would have been some leads and perhaps DNA left behind."
2,"Wooden performances, poor script, awful execution","Come on. Really? Because he was a 'spy' or 'fixer' or whatever, he gains superhuman skills? Picks out the guy in the video, only needs one try to find him, goes to one whorehouse and finds his daughters coat...and all the escapes!I'm an action picture lover, but like someone once said ""it doesn't have to be possible, just plausable."" This flick is neither."
2,Taken leave of its senses!,"Liam Neeson probably made this film for the money, though it does reaffirm that he can be a highly credible action star. But the movie itself is deeply silly and wholly unworthy of Neeson's talent and dignity. As supposedly a highly experienced government covert operative Neeson's character's skills seem to be restricted to knuckleheaded violence when a moment's pause may deliver better results.The movie could therefore be accused of ignoring its own internal logic: how this highly trained professional uses his specialist skills to rescue his kidnapped daughter... apart from the fact that it really has no logic other than seeking an excuse to set up the next fight.Some effort on reseach and writing could have produced a decent thriller out of the idea behind this film. As it stands the movie is probably best watched after three beers on a Saturday night with all critical faculties suspended. To be fair, in these circumstances, it passes the time entertainingly."
5,Great film!,"Edge of your seat action, some scenes are far-fetched but you won't care,the movie theatre was packed, everyone applauded at the end, you won't be disappointed!"
1,Taken,I love the movie taken. However I wasn't able to watch it because it kept stopping or it would stop and go back it the main menu.
1,poor srvice,"tried to watch the movie all through the day but it would not play, didn't even got to watch it but i was still charged for it. very disappointed, very poor service from you guys."
5,Taken 1,"Although it's not essential, seeing Taken 1 prior to Taken 2 is worth the effort. I'd rate both films highly and right up there with the Bourne Triology."
5,Taken review,I throughly enjoyed this movie. My heart was pounding and I was on the edge of my seat by the end of the movie. The relationship between the daughter and father was believable. The action was fast paced and kept you guessing. It also draws attention to the world of kidnapping for the sex trade. I would watch it again.
2,Over the top and predictable!,"An action movie for sure, but it's just too over the top to really enjoy. Perhaps if Liam wore a super hero costume... then we could buy all the leaps. Glad I rented it and did not waste $20 at the theater watching it."
3,Old man action fullfillment,Amazon video streaming service is not to blame for the mediocrity of this film. In itself the movie is pretty fun but over all seems like middle aged divorce wish fulfillment.
4,Good Movie,Looking for a good movie on a Saturday night and re-watched this one. Enjoyed it as much the second time.
5,Great Movie!,"Action packed, good acting and a well written script. My wife enjoyed the movie as well. I can't wait to watch Taken 2."
4,What I do best,I purchased the item because it's a good movie. The item came on time. The item also included a digital copy which is a plus.
5,Breathtaking,"Fast-paced, well choreographed, and absolutely believable, this movie is a super thriller! Masterful acting, much action, cutting-edge photography, and contextualized in today's world, this powerful story brings home a sharp reality."
4,Action,"I really like this movie and it was full of action, i am thinking of renting Taken 2. I have not made up my mind, but i really enjoyed the first one."
3,TAKEN DVD Region 2,I ordered the DVD I did not realize Region (2) Would Not operate on US DVD Players I ended up sending it back for I could not play it in US Player I think when a DVD Says a Region next to it that it should be labeled what that Region means to be able to play or operste in what DVD Players The DVD Might of been fine if I could of played it to see if it was. I wish I was WARNED Of the Region and what it means before I purchased it That Region 1 thru 6 Is all new to me but I learned by asking questions Amazon Customer Service was nice enough to explain . I only wish I was aware of that before I puchased it Thank you.
5,Messed with the wrong daddy!!,I watched this movie again before watching Taken 2. I loved it as much this time as I did the first. I love Liam Neeson and loved his part in the movie. Fun and action packed!!
5,Great movie,I have never wanted to see bad guys get killed so badly in my life. A great movie. I watched it twice in two days.
5,"Must SEE kind of movie, great actors, lots of action A+++++","Must SEE kind of movie, great actors, lots of action, very interesting story line. Very recommended."
4,Good action movie with a lesson,"I did not see this movie in the theater and saw it for the first time about a month ago on DVD. I was very impressed. Although this movie had a lot of violence (especially the extended unrated version), the violence was necessary based on the subject matter.I think every teenage girl and young woman should see this movie. Both Amanda and Kim, the two teenage girls portrayed in the movie were very naive and too trusting and therefore easy prey for the sex slave merchants. Their actions practically said ""take me, I am here alone in a strange city with no one to protect me"". Not every young female is going to have an ex-CIA dad to save them.What I liked about Liam Neeson character is even after his daughter and her friend were kidnapped, he didn't berate his wife with ""I told you so, you just didn't listen"". He seemed more interested in getting his daughter back safe rather than making his ex feel guilty and foolish."
5,sweet movie,Liam Nelson has done a great job with this character. One of the best roles I have seen him in. He tears through Paris looking for his daughter after being kidnapped and completely takes you along with him. The scene where he speaks slowly and deeply to the kidnapper feels as iconic of a moment as General Patton in front of the American flag. Great movie.
5,"As stated, excellent product and great delivery. Thank you.",Expedited delivery quickly and wonderful product. Thank you. Would do business again with this seller. A++++
5,No Nonsense Action Fest,"Taken is a movie that takes no prisoners -- yes there are holes in the plot, yes some of it is predictable, yes it is not very deep. But this movie doesn't pretend to be any of those things. The charisma of this film lies in it's willingness to be a bit over the top and keep the suspense ratcheted up. That's it. And this movie does that. Liam Neeson plays a terrific role in this film. 5 stars was an easy decision for me quite simply because I really enjoyed watching it.Side note to those who buy the ""2-disc extended edition"": the second disc is merely a digital copy of the movie. It doesn't contain any extras from the first disc. The 2-disc set is a ripoff for that reason, but I didn't want that piece of shady advertising to detract from my review of the movie itself."
3,save your money and just rent.,"If you like a moive that pretty much action and not much of a plot. I would not advise you to pick up a copy of this film, unless you get for three bucks. Without giving you the ending of this film, it is very likely to come to this kinda ending in the real world."
4,If It Quacks Like a Duck....,"I'm not going to mince words. ""Taken"" is trash cinema in the best sense. I would have loved to have been a fly on the wall when the film's premise was pitched. Ex-CIA operative trying to rescue his comely teenage daughter in Paris after she's kidnapped by an Albabian white slavery ring. Probably the honchoes listening to the spiel were sold at mid-sentence. What makes the film palatable is the prescence of Liam Neeson. Neeson does his ""Schindler's List"" best to elevate this project above it's pulp roots. Neeson and the film's makers keep you in their grip from start to finish. After it's over though you realize that what you've seen is preposterous. Don't tax your brain cells too hard and enjoy the thrill ride."
4,Great Action in this movie.,This movie has great action and a great story. I was very entertained while watching this movie. Would watch again.
5,hotttt diggity,"Not usually my cup of tea, but daaaaang. this movie is good. when you look up bad@$$ in visual thesaurus it shows a picture of Liam Neeson. I'd give it a 4.5 if I could, just because the story could have used a bit more development, but sometimes you just want to see someone kick the crap out of people right?! right."
5,Action Packed Movie,This was a great movie with lots of action. I liked it so much I have requested to be notified when Taken 2 is released so I can order it.
5,Awesome movie!,This is a great movie about a retired CIA Operative whose daughter is kidnapped in a foreign country. Very action packed and very well thought out by the producers. Highly recommended for fans of action thrillers.
3,"Its Not Awful, its meh","If amazon had a 2 and 1/2 star choice i would pick it, because this movie doesnt deserve 3 stars. Its not awful and there weren't really any dull moments but the ending made no sense to the story. The story its self was pretty neutral and isnt bad or good, and if the ending had been great, the movie would have been great. With a neutral story like this, the ending means everything and shapes the look back of the movie"
5,Taken review,"This video was actually a Christmas gift for my daughter,and I don't know anything about the movie. However, my daughter was delighted to receive it. It arrived quickly and in excellent condition."
3,"Taken, Movie review","The Movie Taken, sent on time without any problemswith shipping or cost. I'm a happy camper."
3,A little more acting and plot would have gone a long way,"I have to say all in all I was disappointed by Taken. First of all, I think the best thing in it is the acting of Liam Neeson. He is completely believable as the retired CIA assassin who goes to great lengths to return his kidnapped daughter. Now granted that suspension of belief is key to any movie but Taken really tests this. For one thing, no one but Neeson's character seems to be able to shot straight and he is mysteriously impervious to bullets.Also, he can overcome any security system and much like the Rambo movies, if there is a place guarded by 100 armed men, he can take it single handily. The other characters are superfluous and the other friend who goes to Paris with Maggie Grace might as well have one of the old Star Trek red shirts because we know she's going to be sacrificed to show how bad these dudes are.All in all a movie that well good enough, could have been so much better with some thought put into the script."
4,"Kickin' it Old School, and lovin' it!","Liam Nesson plays as Bryan Mills, a father of a daughter who is kidnapped. Same old, same old, right? Wrong. This is an action-packed adventure that keeps you on the edge of your seat the entire film. Its fight scenes are amazingly chorographed, and the pace of the film is so fast, that you don't even pay attention to the plot, you just watch Mills do his thing. The guy will stop at nothing to find his daughter, and that's when the fun begins. I will say though, the movie does have a heart. Mills, previous to his daughter's kidnapping, retired to spend time with his daughter. He's divorced and is overshadowed by the stepfather and the mother. He's not a perfect guy, but he's a perfect action hero."
5,Taken,"Great service and DVD.I still haven't loaded my digital copy as yet due to some of my technical issues, but we've watched regular copy multiple times and never a flaw.Thanks Rickey"
5,Must see !!!!!!!!,I am not going to go into tons of details like a lot of reviews...all I am going to say is SEE THIS MOVIE...yes you know the plot...yes you know what is going to happen....but the action is so good and he is such a bad ass in this movie....you are cheering for him the whole time.....I will watch this again and again
4,The critics are way off,"I have not been sucked into a movie like this in a long time. I was actually sweating! I've always thought critics usually get it right, but not this one. See it for yourself; you won't be disappointed. Liam Neeson is outstanding in this intense, but satisfying thriller about a father whose daughter is kidnapped while vacationing in Europe. Unfortunately for the bad guys, Neeson makes Jason Bourne look like a pussy cat as he tries to get her back. The action scenes are excellent, but violent.Some have criticized this movie for not pausing to question the morality of Neesom's rampage, but ""Taken"" has a very raw and straightfoward purpose - to connect the viewer emotionally to Neeson as he singelmindedly pursues his daughter. I get the sense the filmmakers recognize that at some point, with all of us, family and paternal bonds trump moral dilemmas.A word of caution - If you have a daughter, your gut will be in knots the whole time."
5,Taken is an excellent movie!,"Enjoyed this very much... good tense, drama!Wanted to see it before I went to the sequel at theater and was not disappointed."
5,Excitement....,"This movie will keep you on the edge of your seat. Action-packed, hair-raising, great movie! Can't wait to see the sequel."
3,Intense and full of action.,"it was beyond suspenseful...great movie, put together well and the acting was great...but there is no way I could ever watch it again because of how disturbing and disgusting it was. I almost threw up at the end."
3,Taken- Blu-ray,"I'm going to start off by saying that I really enjoy this movie and all of the great reviews are well deserved. The reason I've gone down the middle of the road with my rating is because of the poor transfer. When I buy Blu-ray I tend to expect a great picture. Taken has a little too much grain through most of the movie with the worst scenes being low-light situations (especially right after the construction site scene: at this point it looks like the movie was projected onto a rough tweed backdrop). If the filmmakers did this for effect it was a bad move because it takes me right out of the movie and gets me thinking about stupid things like transfers... Again, I liked this movie enough to buy the Blu-ray after I had already seen it, I just don't feel like I got what I paid for."
5,Let God sort 'em out...,"This is one of those great action movies where the hero isn't burdened by doubt, ineptitude, or guilt. He knows what he has to do and he does it coolly and ruthlessly! What he does is kill bad guys... Lots and lots of bad guys of all nationalities, races, and creeds who deserve what they get. Very efficient and ecumenical...I lost count, but Liam Neeson must have killed about 50 bad guys in this one. And they keep on spawning so he has more to kill. I haven't seen one hero take on so many bad guys who keep on reproducing since Steven Segal made ""Hard to Kill""...The action is non-stop and the retribution is very satisfying. There is a lot of violence, but this is not an explicit blood and gore film. Just good old Hollywood movie violence that hits you at the gut level. ""Taken"" is a nice vicarious vigilante thrill for all the rest of us who must play by the rules. Liam Neeson does an excellent job! Highly recommended for action fans..."
3,FALSE ADVERTISEMENT!,"Yeah, I got my movie, it was GREAT! but was fooled into thinkin that I was gonna get lots of bonus features with it being a 2 disc DVD in all. And there was nothin ""extended"" about the unrated version, there were no scenes in the movie I haven't see already, so that sucked. I could've gotten the 1 disc and not missed anything, the 2nd disc is nothin but a digital copy! I didn't need that. Sneaky and false, and sheisty DVD packaging companies! They tell you 2 disc extended edition to make some extra cash off people, they trick you into spendin the extra dollars because you think you're gettin somethin extra than the 1 disc, it's nothin! PLEASE BE CAREFUL YOU READ EVERY WORD BEFORE YOU BUY, BECAUSE THEY HOPE THAT YOU GET FOOLED!"
1,Won't play,The copy protection on this movie prevented it from playing in both my TV (Sony Bravia KDL-40EX40B) or my computer.
5,Classic,"The first time I saw this movie, I was mute, the story is a story that every parent of a daughter can identify with. We protect our own, I just wish in life I had some of the fathers resources."
5,One of the best,"Edge of your seat for the entire movie, keeps you wondering how this poor girl will ever be found. Great action all the way through. All the way a five star."
2,just to much,"I expected something better than the first part,but is just worse.I feel sorry for the US EMBASSY because this movie make the securitylook like S........THAN YOU."
5,Action Packed,"If you want to see the ultimate bad-@ss movie, watch this movie. Liam Neeson does an amazing job. There's no hesitation in his quest to find his daughter. If that were me, I'd hope Liam Neeson was my Dad."
3,good movie at least,"good movie but i wish the controls were easier and that the movie didn t skip, i don t think i could activate subtitles either"
3,Okay!,"Bought this as an inexpensive gift for one of our holiday parties. I find it hard to watch, my husband and 18 year old son love it."
2,Good movie poor quality,"The video quality was poor and it is not based on my internet speed. My internet is 100mps and my TV is direct wired to my apple router. Streaming video is not for me when it is on a 65"" TV. If I was using my I-Pad then I am sure it would be fine."
1,"Ended too quickly (the good part, that is)","I actually enjoyed the first few minutes of the movie, and was looking forward to seeing how he was going to cleverly accomplish the mission. However, it quickly collapsed into an impossible shoot-em-up, highlighted by incredible car chases, at night, thru unfamiliar streets and construction sites, with the hero never failing to make the perfect move. Oh, and the expenditure of countless rounds of ammunition, and a jump from a bridge to a boat, perfectly timed after speeding thru streets and causing untold collateral damage. I wondered who took care of all those ""accidents"" and where were the authorities during this mayhem? And how did the daughter get her passport back?"
1,defective dvd sent times 2,i purchased this movie in 2009 only to have the dvd start stopping and skipping about an hour into the movie. amazon.com was helpful enough to send another dvd to replace the defective one. last night i finally got the chance to view the replacement dve. GUESS WHAT!!! it starts stopping and skipping in exactly the same spot as the first copy. i will never be able to see what finally happens.
1,shallow P.O.S.,What a TYPICALLY SHALLOW AND PREDICTBLY SCRIPTED P.O.S. I HAVE SEEN AND REVIEWED MANY HUNDREDS OF MOVIES. THIS MOVIE IS NOT WORTH THE POPCORN AND DRINK PRICE TO SEE IT. VERY DISAPOINTING.DONT SEE FOR YOUR SELVES!!!
5,Taken,"By far, one of the best movies. Excellent plot and the movie kept you on the edge of your seat. Liam Neeson makes the BEST bad good guy."
4,Great Film !,"Fast-moving film with excellent acting by Liam Neeson; about a REAL problem in this world of mistreating young women by kidnapping them, drugging them and making them sex slaves. Shocking!"
5,Excellent,I am still happy I bought this movie and unknown and Taken 2. This actor holds your interest through the hole movie. I continue to buy what he plays in. I could watch his movies many times and still want to see it again and I do.
4,A Real Eye Opener,Taken gives a startling look into the world of human trafficking and the sex slave trade. In a captivating story it shows the horrific reality of life for young women lured or forced into the sex trade.
5,What! Liam!!!,Liam!! What do I say about this MAN!! AWESOME!! BRILLIANT!! SUPER BAD @$$!!! This was a must have! I love it!
2,Blechh!,I really did not realize that Liam Neeson cannot act until I saw this movie. The idea was to have this guy mimic Jason Bourne but he fails depressingly while trying. The teenage girl is a super annoying silly brat and some of the escapes are beyond the boundaries of disbelief. I am sorry I paid money to watch it.
5,action packed!!,"lovlove Liam Neeson, he's a great actor keeps you sitting on the edge of your chair..can't wait to see 'taken 2'"
4,great action film,"Liam Neeson proves he can play the action hero as well s anyone in this action thriller.he plays the father of a 17year old who has been kidnapped while in Paris.with very little to go on,he races against time to find her kidnappers and save her.oh,and he has a very particular set of skills.in short,they messed with the wrong guy.what follows are some very intense fight scenes,which are very well choreographed.but this is not just an action movie.there are certainly some dramatic moments and the movie is tinged with sadness,as some of the events in the movie mirror reality.of course being a Hollywood movie,you pretty much know how it will end,although it didn't end completely the way i thought it would.all in all, a very entertaining movie,that also makes you think.for me,Taken is a 4/5"
4,Awsome Action-Thriller!,"I really enjoyed watching this film from start to finish. It was a great fast-paced thriller. Liam Neesen was awesome! He should do more films like this one. CIA spy (former) suits him. The action sequences were thoroughly enjoyable and satisfying - they were very fluid, impressive to see, and believable. It's always nice to see the main character kick ass like no tomorrow. This film rocks!"
1,Ce film était terrible,"See that French quote I used for my review title? Cutting and pasting that into a google search will bring you more pleasure than this movie will. All I can ask is WHY did Neeson ever agree to star in this one?? Did his Schindler's List money run out already? This type of nonsense is better left to the governor of California for heavens sake. The first twenty minutes serve to ""develop the charactors"" then it's shoot this, break that, fly threw this, jump on that, swing from this rope and mimic spiderman. I felt like I was watching a video game of twenty bad guys attacking the good guy with their fists up and mouths open just waiting to get bashed. I honestly feel a little dumber after having watched it. Who is really going to pay $350,000 for that girl anyway?? And why wouldn't the fat guy at the end just give her back instead of putting up a fight. You know, like say ""sorry I didn't know she was your daughter, here you go pal."" Silly silly silly. Adios"
4,Amazing,The action in Taken was amazing. It was riveting. Who cares if Liam Neesom is like a cat with nine lives.
4,Simply Satisfying,"Taken isn't a deep-thinker kind of movie, which can be good or bad depending on what kind of movie you want to see. If you want to see a bunch of scum-of-the-earth types get what they deserve (and who doesn't?), delivered with cool efficiency, interspersed with great chase scenes, action and fighting, then this is the movie to see. As one reviewer said, it was refreshing to see the hero unhindered by doubts or other contrived emotional complications. His singleness of purpose and Liam Neeson's own intensity and likability in the role draws you in to cheer for him every step of the way, and takes you along happily on this vigilante ride."
4,Gripping movie,"Wow! This is a pretty good movie with a great storyline and some cool twists and turns about a father who goes to rescue his daughter when she has been kidnapped into the sex slave trade. Some great scenes and dialogue, a movie to remember."
3,Good movie,The movie was really good. And I liked the idea of watching movies on my ipad. However the movie buffered every minute to play about two minutes of the movie. Once the problem gets fixed I would love to watch more movies off of amazon.
4,Taken Movie review,"This movie is a good family friendly suspense and drama thriller that maybe has too much violence for younger children but for teens and up is a good movie if a person likes action-type movies! Well acted and suspensefull, it will be enjoyed by most but probably appeal to males!"
4,Good action movie,"If you're going to watch this movie thinking it is some great drama with a fantastic plot, then you shouldn't watch it. If you like watching close combat fights, car chases and international criminals getting their fannies handed to them, then you will definitely be entertained."
3,Taken,No one is free from being shot. Might make a acceptable video game. The action stunts are a little more realistic that say those in karate movies.
1,Liam Neeson earns the one star,"....but the movie was dreadful. Neeson was the only good thing about it, but he couldn't save it. Amazed to see there's a sequel."
1,Amazon technical fail.,"It never loaded onto my TIVO, so we didn't watch it. I ended up purchasing it thru the TIVO rather than thru the Amazon website. It was $1 more, but at least it worked."
3,BlueRay discs compartibility,"Was unable to see this movie as my BlueRay player is in Region B AND the movie was for Region A players. Please sell us movies that plays in all Regions, the ones compartible with ALL regions ."
5,Taken,"enjoyed the movie. the good guys kicked a lot of bad guy behinds. loved it when the good guy (Neeson) had a bady tied to a chair and wired to the light switch. after getting the info he wanted and was leaving, he flipped on the switch. I know what 120 volts feels like and the bady deserved it. i will watch it again and again. Liam Neeson is a super star."
1,not happy!!,"When the movie came in the mail, the package was damaged! So I went and put the movie in and it never played. Like if the disc was blank! So I called and had another one sent out here. But guess what!!! That one didnt play either! !! And yet, im still waiting for my refund!!"
4,You'll like this is you like Jason Bourne movies,"I saw this movie in the theater and absolutely enjoyed it. It had me on the edge of the seat for more than half the movie. Some parts of this movie is somewhat unbelieveable - but hey, that's what entertainment is all about. Lots of action, fast-paced, and if you liked the last three Jason Bourne movies (Borne Identity, Ultimatum, Supremacy), then your bound to like this. It was good enough to make me spring for the blu-ray to recreate that theater experience once again."
3,Asks for a blu ray player update,"I can't play this movie until my player is updated. this is a shame, I just wanted to watch this movie with my wife on sunday."
4,Good action thriller,Very good action packed movie. The only thing that would have made it better would be a bit more on the main character's background. How'd he get to be a 50 plus year old Jack Bauer?
3,"Good overall, but disturbing in parts","I enjoyed the movie's action, but more than anything the movie should be appreciated for its candid portrayal of sex trafficking in Europe. I like that the movie tackled this subject, but viewers should be aware of the fact that some scenes in the movie are emotionally disturbing because they show kidnapped women involuntarily strung out on drugs and being used for sex. It's a movie worth watching more because of the subject it tackles than because of the action, so viewers should be prepared for it to be heavier than a Bourne movie."
5,Excellent,I've seen it before & loved it would highly recommend it to any who like Liam neeson a must have
4,GREAT CAMERA FOR THE PRICE,WE USED THIS CAMERA IN OUR BARN FOR THE BIRTH OF A FOAL. IT WAS MID WINTER SO IT WAS QUITE COLD. THE CAMERA WORKED GREAT FOR OUR PURPOSES. WE HAD TO BE ABLE TO TELL WHEN THE MARE STARTED TO GO INTO LABOR AND TO WATCH THE FOAL AFTERWARDS. THE ONLY COMPLAINT WE HAVE IS THE ADJUSTMENT ON THE RECEIVER IS HARD TO GET DIALED IN. ONCE AJUSTED IT WAS GREAT.
3,A good book that definitely needs a newer edition,It is a nice book with a collection of topics specific to its title. I had this book for a course in 1988 and it provided a good understanding of the concepts relevant at the time. The end of chapter problems can do with some improvements. Some chapters are definitely outdated specially those dealing with ancient :) technologies. With the advancements in this field a newer edition would help provide a good understanding on these topics in the signature style.
5,Best of the Twentieth Century,"To be succinct: this is one of the best books of the late twentieth century. Swift's LAST ORDERS is sure to get the lion's share of attention now that it's been made into a movie, but WATERLAND surpasses Last Orders in every way. In terms of its entirely original and convincing structure and voice, Waterland is a twentieth century masterpiece."
2,Couldn't get into it.,"A very slow-moving, frustrating reading experience. I couldn't get into it and didn't finish it. Ended by skipping around, trying to get re-interested. What some people mean by ""poetic"" is what others would call aimless, a device to avoid actually having to interpret anything. Instead, the author gives snapshot histories. Some people call that ""postmodern"" instead of lazy or not very well done. Not my taste, although apparently others liked it well enough."
2,I'm in the minority,"This seems to be a truly loved, highly regarded novel. I'll admit that I'm in the minority, and am probably wrong about this book, but I didn't like it. I found myself skipping pages at a time. What others loved about the language, I found self-indulgent and ponderous. Characters were not well-fleshed. I found the plot to be trivial and implausible."
5,Amazing!,"""Waterland"" is something that has never before been written, the zoomed timing reflects upon Virginia Woolf but the work is as for its structure much more complex. A combination of history and science, presenting the Fenland and its coast, biography and fiction in a Dickensian tradition with a mixture of comics and tragedy-but never in access! Compare the description of the ways of eel from Sargasso to the Ouse with the static life of the people of marshland! But in their minds, there is wild traffic!"
2,This was so disappointing,"Son Of A Wanted Man is the first audio book I've ever listened to and I was so disappointed with it! I was hoping to hear the story as Mr. L'Amour intended it to be - as he wrote it. Instead, it's a lot of bad ""character acting"" and ridiculous sound effects. It completely detracts from the story. Please tell me that not all of the audio books are like this!Beau L'Amour should be ashamed of himself for ruining his father's work this way. It truly is awful. The voices don't fit the characters and they certainly don't convey the personalities of the characters.My father taught me to read with Louis L'Amour books. Mustang Man was my first. I've been reading his books for almost 40 years now and I can't express enough how disappointing this audio book was. I sincerely hope they are not all this way."
2,Repeated story,"I liked the story, but had read the same story line in another of L'Amour's books, of which I now have over 55. I was disappointed, but read it all again anyway."
1,Boring,"This book gives a condensed history of the origins and rise of the Motorola Corporation, from its founding fathers to the 1990s. This book:1. Describes the various people involved in the beginning and growth of Motorola, both scientists and businessmen.2. Explains the scientific discoveries and engineering breakthroughs that affected Motorola, including those by its own employees, and by others3. Shows how specific events like wars affected Motorola and its business.The book is written in chronological order, beginning with the the beginnings of the company around 1900 to the modern-day; 1990s. Overall, the book is fact-filled but extremely boring to read. This is one of the most boring corporate histories I have ever read, and I would not suggest taking the time to read this."
4,Rugged Knife,"This knife was sent to me in Iraq. It survived two tours in the marine infantry and has cut everything; plastic, rope, wood... It came with a great edge as do all benchmades but it is very hard to find anyone that can bring it back to its original edge. It is very heavy for a knife which is one of the reasons that I like it and the handle is large enough that it will not slip out of your had when wet or bloody. The ribs on the handle add to the grip but they do a good job of eating through your cloths if you have it clipped to you. I have worn this everyday for four years and use it for everything, this knife was made to last."
5,An excellent Novel,"The protaganists of the novel A Death in the Family are Jay and Mary Follet. The story takes place in 1915 in Knoxville, Tennessee. Life is perfect for the Follet family until Jay goes to see his dad, who has had a minor heart attack, and on his way home gets into an accident and dies instantly. The antagonists would be Jay's death or the wreck he had. The theme is dealing with the loss of a loved one and having family help you through it. The author uses flashbacks to tell teh story. I believe everyone handled Jay's sudden death well by just remembering the man he was and how he affected their lives and everyone showed their respect for him. I thought it was a great book."
2,A tedious masterpiece,"This book is as tedious as the time period in question: the literary device here is obviously to make you understand the horror of living every darned second of pain and misery of a night when a close relative dies. Vivid, evokative, but tedious as hell. I shouldn't have bothered to finish this book. If you read the first 20 pages you know everything you need to know."
2,So this is how it ends: with a whimper...,"James Agee's 1955 novel ""A Death in the Family"" is considered a classic by some. To me, it is overhyped, and utterly joyless. Mixed in with an interesting story of a young family picking up the pieces after the father dies in a car accident, is the worst ""poetic"" ramlbings I've ever read. Did Agee really have to break through the flow of the story with annoying musings that make no sense? The mother, a morbid Catholic, tries to deal with death and her husband's lack of faith. Her brother, Andrew, is easily the best character. With skepticism of religion, and his conflicted emotions, he is an understandable character. Major boos to a santicmonous ""man of God"" in the novel."
2,Confussed...,"Sorry to all of those who liked James Agree's book. I didn't. I didn't follow the parts that were in italic. Who was speaking? Nothing happened in the book. You knew someone was going to die, but Jay Follet didn't die until about a third way into the book. Did Jay's fahter die or not? I couldn't tell. I know Jay left him to come home, but was he dead or alive? I thought Mary was a very believeable women in her response to her husband's death, for the time period. If Mr. Agree had wanted to give the book a little bit of a happier/funnier tone he could have gone on more about Aunt Hannah before she found out about Jay's death. She seemed to be a very quirky person her her time. I felt bad for Rufus. He got picked on all of the time, by the school boys. He never had a friend, which is sad. A boy his age needs friends."
4,father's death provides focus to everyday issues,"a father's death provides focus to everyday issues such as family interactions, society views, childhood mockery, etc."
2,A Let Down,"I had to read this for my college history class, and I was super excited because the author and I share the same name, but I was very disappointed with this book. Perhaps it was not my type of book, but I had to make myself read it and found it quite dry and boring."
4,"Wonderful, yet Confusing","Recently I read A death in the Family by James Agee. My reaction to the book was I loved it, there was so much feeling invovled in the book. You were forced to learn a lesson, not to take anyone or anything for granted. The only problem I had with the book was everything in italics. I was totally confused, to me it had nothing to do with the book. After reading it I found out that the editor's put all of the italics in, because Agee had died before the book was completely finished and the editors were not sure where to put it, so they put it at the end of each section. Over all, I really liked the book, it was warm and it shows how much family really does mean to some people."
2,"Okay, he's a good writer--but I still didn't like this book","Agee was an excellent writer, and in this book he evokes both the joy of living and the numbness of loss masterfully. But after rereading this book a couple times (I felt its reputation warranted another chance), I cannot shake my initial impression that his portrayal of wife and daughter were a bit on the sentimental side. Mary in particular drove me crazy. Her sweetness was cloying, her strength undermined by breathy speeches--which are emphasized with too many italics for my taste. I wish I could agree with all the positive reviews, but for me the quality of writing could not make up for characters and dialogue that drove me bats."
2,A Death in the Family,"The ending was not very good, seemed that too many things were left unanswered for me. Would not recommend this book."
1,Useless!,"This book is not worth the time or money. It teaches you how to write the letters, but provides no practice except for reading animal sounds, a snakes and ladders game, and a word search. Also, it gives culture notes, but uses words that are comprised of katakana characters you haven't learned yet. A much better and fantastic book is Japanese Kana Workbook by P.G. O'Neill"
3,Missing information,"I bought and read the book as it says the ULTIMATE guide to weight training for wrestling.It was far from providing the information as an ultimate guide. All the programs are based on bodybuilding systems and not strength & conditioning programes.It did not give good information on programes used during basic prep, speific perp and comperition periods. It was vague in these areas. It say's nothing about proper loadings yet it says all the programes are for 14 year olds to adults. I found the book to be more about getting a coach or athletes to buy into the authers web site.I could not recommend this book. It is basic at most."
5,Ultimate Guide to Weight Training for Wrestling,This book contains basic weight training exercises that can be applied to a variety of sports that involve the use of a variety of muscle groups.
2,Nothing Innovative for Wrestling Specifically,"I am a wrestling coach and father to three boys who love the sport. I was looking for a book to give my wrestlers an advantage over their competition...geared more towards the off season and what we can do as a team to make a jump up to the next level. What I found in this book was nothing new to anyone who has any sort of weight training experience. It does contain some useful information, and for someone who is looking to educate themselves about weight training for wrestling or football or other similar sports, this book will definately help. But I was looking for something a bit more innovative and specific to wrestling. I was disappointed."
2,weight training for Timothy,"This was a gift, so I cannot review it, but knowing Amazon.com from past purchases for myself, I have no question it is good.The Ultimate Guide to Weight Training for Wrestling"
5,What a wonderful book!,"This is my first time reading a Karen Rose book and I must say I enjoyed it immensely. It had wonderful characters, wonderful romance, and I never suspected who the bad guy was. I will definitely read more of this authors books."
4,EXCELLENT!,"I've read a few of Ms Rose's mysteries and they are excellent! Couldnt put this book down. Kristen Mayhew has a lot of secrets and lives in a certain torment until she meets Detective Abe Reagan. He does not give up on her for a minute and he has a few pieces of trauma to live with himself.A vigilante is killing those who the legal system has allowed to slip away from punishment and Kristen Mayhew is the prosecutor let down by said legal system.Yes, the several killings were a bit much, but deep down, we all understood 'his' motive. Those of us who work with victums will be hard pressed to judge, either way.The solid Reagan family was good to see and tempered all the gory stuff. There were a few other 'bad guys' thrown into the mix. I like Ms Rose's mysteries and will continue to seek them out. I landed at the airport feeling like Justice has been served - this time."
2,Diminishing Returns,"This novel centers around Chicago Public Defender, Kristen Mayhew. An obsessed vigilante is murdering criminals that she has failed to convict, and then sending her letters of admiration. Dectective Abe Reagan of the Chicago Police Department is sent to protect her, as it is feared Kristen could become a target of the vigilante, or other criminals.I found this story a bit of a disappointment. Having read a number of Karen Rose novels, I am starting to see a 'sameness' about them, which I don't like. I found myself cringing at times, at the dialogue between the two main characters, who wereunconvincing. The story was a bit more slow moving, also, in comparison to other Karen Rose novels that I have read. Not one of her best."
2,Longwinded,When you read a book and keep reading it and you don't find anything about the main story after several pages the book is dull and boring. This book could be written with at least 100 pages less.
4,Excellent read,"Received this book from a friend and really enjoyed it. Mayhew is a DA with a frigid demeanor that is melted by a detective with a great family and pain of his own. Oh by the way, a serial killer is on the loose killing people that have gotten away with sexual offenses by the courts. Story is written where you want to turn page to figure out the clues and also to see how the romance between DA and Detective works out. He is one sexy man. Ordering another book by Karen Rose hoping this isn't a one trick pony writer."
4,She does keep improving,"Brenda's songs are full of stories, while still remaining quite lyrical. She has a subdued alto voice that can be quite soothing, but paying attention to her lyrics is very important as she is a talented songwriter. I have purchased the last two Brenda Weiler albums, and I will say that she has improved with the latest effort. The songs al work both as songs and stories .. I felt her last album didn't completely complete that melding. She is very soothing to listen to. Highly recommended!"
2,Lackluster 3rd Effort,"After three years of hearing Brenda perform, I thought by now she would have improved. Her childish vocal ""talent"" borders on high school choir level and it's completely obvious that what talent she holds on the guitar only revolves around chords. She should give more credit to John Hermanson who is the only bright spot on the CD. It would more amptly be credited to him since the majority of the playing is his. So if this would be considered a John Hermanson CD, I'd give it 5 stars, but since Brenda claims it is hers, it is only deserving of 2 stars."
2,Overated Fragrances,"I am disappointed with this product. It lasts for about 10-15 minutes in the AirWasher, then it is gone. I expected it to mix with the water and last as long as water was in the unit."
3,Fragrance does not last,"Adding fragrance when filling results in a delightful smell initially. The fragrance seems to disappear rather quickly however, long before the machine needs to be refilled."
4,Real Hip Hop,"Tight project from this left coast act. Smooth production combined with the laid back rhyme style of Coke (formally of Madcap) and Che'ski equals a solid album. Made in the true spirit of Hip Hop's early days, this album is all about fun. No set trippin' or heavy social issues, just party and B.S....and there's nothing wrong with that every once in awhile. The highlight of the album is the incredibly clever, ""Bomb M.C. Original Recipe"" which pays tribute to the pioneers of the game. The Old Gold remix flips it to a west coast pioneer retrospective, but doesn't hit quite as hard as it's predecessor. Overall the album is short and to the point. No throw away tracks to speak of. You should be able rock this one from begining to end."
1,Used it once and unusable after that,"My wife and I travel a lot and we got this for iPad movies on flight. Used it once on a flight to Hawaii and back. On our next trip, one of the jacks had a loose connection and was unusable."
2,Misleading! Does NOT work with iPhone,"Even though its listed as iPhone compatible on Amazon as well as Monster's own web site, it is not! I wish somebody would either fix their product claims or stop selling the wrong (old?) version of the product."
2,Doesn't work with the iPhone!,"This splitter was listed as iPhone compatible on the Apple site, but it's not. Maybe in a future version it will be, but the one I got mid-July 2007 doesn't fit into the plug on the iPhone which is what I wanted. :-("
4,A great reference to use for breeding Vanda,"This is a great reference to use for breeding and cultivating Vanda, good photographs and very well written."
4,Vanda Orchid Book Review,"It arrived quick, which gives a good reputation for the seller.It is almost new except for the edges of the jacket. But if you open the book it smells new and looks crisply new.The book is very informative and presents pictures of the orchids that it discusses...both rare and ancient orchids that are now renamed by modern standards. The culture and the history of the plants are exact, precise and concise.I am very satisfied with the book."
5,That is not a Horn you hear,Lipbone Redding really sets himself apart by this original jazzy/bluesy/r&b type feel alblum. Even more amazing is the horn sound you hear is made by his lips only....a must buy
5,BEAUTIFUL Art and Excellent Text 5-15C,"This 1988 book is filled with beautiful photographs of the art of Zadar, 5-15Ca. It includes many themes and various media... from tile work and mosaics, to relief carvings, to metalwork in gold, textiles, paintings, sculpture, architecture, paper paintings, etc.. Every page is mesmirizing-- beautiful and spiritual. A good portion of the art is religious, but not all. The text explains the background history and is easy to understand. This is an absolutely beautiful book with top notch photography. Each time I look at it, I notice something new."
2,Washing this a million times won't help it get any better.,Garage grunge that is better produced than a true garage sound but still just sucks. One of the worst albums I own. Skip it. Not worth your time
4,Good But You have to write big.,The Mimio whiteboard scanner was very easy to setup and get running. I was really surprised with how easy it was to use. When you get the product be sure to go check out the Mimio web site for software updates. The only problem I have is that you have to write kind-of big to make it legiable on the computer screen and some times if you not writing hard enough it doesn't pick up. But overall this is a very good product.
5,Amazing,"I was at this concert and it was the most amazing thing I have ever seen or heard, ever. They opened with a percusion piece that knocked you on your but and it just built from there. By the end of the set you had to just walk away for a bit. It a was at the Ann Arbor Blues and Jazz festival and at the that festival I also saw incredible performances by Ornette Coleman and blues legend Son House, but neither one compared to the Art Ensemble of Chicago that day."
5,POW/MIA bracelet,"Anyone can look at my wrist and see what my causes are. It was so good to add to my yellow (support the troops) band, pink (breast cancer awareness) band, and my camo (1-800 Go Guard) band with the black POW/MIA."
1,No Glow or blue for my blond hair!,I ordered this hopeing to turn my blond hair glowing blue in support of the Indianapolis Colts in the Superbowl! I was very disapointed in this product because it did not turn my blond hair blue and it did not glow once it was on my hair. :(
1,DISSAPOINTED ALSO,I WANTED TO USE THIS AT LOCAL SKATING RINK ON NEW YEARS EVE - AND MAYBE ABLE TO SELL MORE AS I GOT THIS IN SHOP ALSO - WELL I PUT IT IN [[ AFTER READING ALL DIRECTIONS ]]GEE...... IN COMPLETE DARKNESS THERE WAS A SLIGHT BLUE GLOW - BUT AT THE RINK --- NO ONE NOTICED IT AT ALL...EVEN UNDER DISCO AND UB LIGHTS --I PUT IT ON AT 8:00 PM ---- ALLOWED TIME TO REACH FULL GLOW....WAS SKATING MOST OF THE NIGHT -- WITH TOWEL TRYING TO KEEP IT OUT OF MY EYES -- SINCE THE SWEAT WAS ON FOREHEAD ....WELL I GOT BACK AND WASHED IT OUT OF MY HAIR AT 12:30 PM NEW YEARS EVE...WASTE OF MONEY...... JUST WISH I WAS ABLE TO RETURN THE OTHER 7 COLORS I GOT ROPEED IN TO BUYING ......
5,A marvelous introduction,"I can do little more than echo the other reviewers here. This is all a 'selected poems' shoud be: introductory and selective. Yes, ""Funeral Blues"" is missing. But no one can complain about what is here, which includes ""In Time of War"", the great sonnet sequence; ""The Quest"", another long sequence; and the entirety of THE SEA AND THE MIRROR, which is based on Shakespeare's THE TEMPEST. If you are, however, only interested in his love poems, I'd have to steer you toward TELL ME THE TRUTH ABOUT LOVE, a nice little chapbook containing only those.My own personal experience with this book may be relevant. It has served to introduce me to one of the finest poets of the last century and sparked a desire to read THE COLLECTED POEMS, also edited by Mendelson, to see how Auden re-wrote thirty of the brilliant poems here included. I'm continuing on my voyage; hope you are starting on yours."
5,amazing book,It is very difficult to find accurate information in English on 17th century China. But this book combines an interesting story with in depth (understandable!) information-- highly recommended.
4,Works great,"I bought this to pick my fruit trees, I already had the fruit picking part, but not the pole. I did have to put some tape around the top of the pole so it wouldn't be loose but snug. [but that has nothing to do with the pole, just what I needed it for] I love it and now I can finally get the fruit at the top of my tree."
3,broke early,"Was using this item for the second time and washing some tall windows on my house. Was moving in more of a side-to-side motion and the black plastic screw piece on the end where you attach a brush, broke off. This should not have broke with what I was using it for. The only reason this is not a one or zero star is that the manufacturing company said they would send a replacement if I pain for shipping. I'm working through that process now to get the part replace. Well see how it goes."
3,Light Duty,"Light duty extension pole. Not quite sturdy enough to hold an empty fruit picker, not going to try picking fruit with it. Read the description, it is LIGHT DUTY. May be good for cleaning spiderwebs up high."
4,long reach,I am pleased with the extension. While it makes things so much safer then using a ladder. I would recommend this to anyone who has to reach to do painting.
2,Dissatisfied.,"The long arm is well made, But, When extended it like trying to wash my Fifthwheel with a fishing pole.Flexies to much. Can't put any pressure up high. I bought this so I could wash from the ground and not from a ladder."
1,Do not buy - battery life is terrible,"I bought two of these for my Kodak Z810 camera. After the wall charger says it's done charging, I put it in my camera and the low battery warning comes up immediately. This happens with both of my batteries. It's not worth the savings. Buy the Kodak model instead."
2,"Content ok, publishing quality poor","The material in the book is useful only if you are in the field of journalism or education, and the quality of the publishing is poor, (i.e. not bound well, pages falling out, hardback without dustcover...)"
3,a draconian view of snabulous rumitage,"well, i'll be flipped...this joystick of a phlanser is the most egregious wooper yet to be pulsed...who ever thought that goony and sam would meet south of drama-town and web the gyro?"
3,Overlooked,"As a musician I have always admired Robert Russell Bennett's arrangements. Arrangements contribute more to the success of a musical composition than most listeners realize, and I often wondered about Bennett's role in the success of Richard Rogers musicals. And I wondered about his work. The Broadway Sound is a fascinating read, every bit as interesting as Bennett arrangements."
4,Ball joint,I would recommend this product. Went on fairly easy and had a good solid feel and look to them. Only thing left to do is to see how long they hold up.
5,Perfect Taste!,"I find this work from Dave Randall possibly one of the best 100 albums ever recorded, and surely the best I have heard since 1990. So much good taste, technically delicate, and spiritually full of colour. The track selection is excellent and sonically a rainbow of perfect balance. Kirsty Capshaw's interventions are full of sentiment and life!. Too bad this album is so hard to find. But after some searching, I succeeded."
1,How is this a real thing?,"I laughed harder at textbooks. Spend this money on subdermal electrodes that randomly shock you while you drive, you'll have a better time."
4,The cutting-edge truth strikes again,"Ms. Bane has expressed the thoughts of so many of us with the cartoons in this book. Everyone at some time or the other experienced a weasel moment and now someone has taken the time to show the world that it's a shared experience. Containing flashes of comic genius reminisceniscent of the late B. Kliban's non-cat work or Gary Larson at his best and universal thruths that speak to each of us, this is a book that will continue to amuse and entertain you for years to come."
2,You get what you pay for,"We bought the Conair hair clipper with all the attachments because it seemed like the best deal. We defintely got $25 worth of use from the clipper, but that's it. We used the clipper to cut hair for 2 people on occasion. We probably used it for about 7 haircuts then the clipper head broke...in the midst of the last haircut. The cheap screws broke inside and the head just fell off. I tried to finish the haircut with scissors. If you are one person trying to cut your own hair, using scissors can prove to be quite the challenge.If you are looking for a cheap little clipper kit, this is the one you want. But, if you plan on using it on a regular basis or for more than one person, I would not recommend it. This clipper could leave you with a head of half cut hair...By the way, don't store the oil in the combo kit with the rest of the stuff because the little oil container leaks."
4,understanding complexities of human backgrounds,"The book offers a global perspective on multiculturalism. Showing a complex interplay of how individuals construct their identities from multiple sources. This is reinforced by a varied choice of authors who have contributed to this book.Several authors speak on their personal experiences, offering these as examples of diversity. One example is Nadya Fouad. She said that she could ""pass"" for white. But she also identifies strongly with her mother's Brazilian culture, and calls herself hispanic. But she also has an Arab surname. Another example was Daya Sandhu. His parents were Sikhs from Pakistan. Who had to flee to India due to discrimination from Muslims.Such examples of contributors enrich the book, by letting the reader develop an awareness of and a sensitivity to the subtleties of human backgrounds."
3,"Good, but lacking...","This is a good book for those studying multicultural issues today. I don't know that I was able to glean as much information as I have gotten from other class materials and books though. It's easy to read, but to me it was lacking information that could be very useful for counselors and for studying different ethnic groups."
3,"Not the best, but worth having...","This album may not be the best place for a person curious about the Church to begin, but it does have a few songs worth the price - especially as a cut-out. 'Welcome' starts off the album in fine fashion. Steve Kilbey lists several people - both living and dead - making comments about some. It reminds me in some ways of the song by the Beloved from some years ago 'Hello'. 'Comedown' is the hit that should have been. This song alone is worth the price of the CD to me. Catchy tune, catchy words all come together to make one of the top 25 songs in the band's catalogue. There are three instrumentals on the album, not all of which are necessary. Of the remaining songs 'Ladyboy' is my favourite, though many fans also enjoy the 14+ minute title track. It isn't the crown jewel of the Church's catalogue. Not altogether a satisfying listen, but an album for fans."
4,It's Boone's Film All the Way,"Richard Boone carries this rather unevenWestern, with superb support from a stellarcast, although Whitman's role is disappointinglysmall - THE COMANCHEROS is a better choicefor Whitman fans. Boone's is a rare blendof tough-guy savagery and rough-edgedhumanity, and contemporary Hollywood is starved forthe authentic manliness that actors likeBoone once brought to the screen. Factor inhis distinctively droll humor, and you havethat indefinable Star Power so elusive today.Granted, the film - as noted in previousreviews - is startlingly violent, but itis not gratuitously so. On the contrary,the movie trades Hollywood-style storytellingfor realism. There are no ""good soldiers"" or""bad Indians"" here - only flawed human beingsstruggling to survive against insurmountableodds."
1,Amazon won't sell it to me.,"I would like to download to buy this movie but Amazon doesn't have a version for the Mac - in the 21st century yet. Now I notice that the PC download version is full screen, not widescreen. If they put out a Mac version that is only full screen, I won't buy that either. Amazon, what are you doing? What are you doing? There are a number of other video on demand westerns I would like to buy as well.Derek"
4,Good begginers Book,Karl Fulves has been putting out these kinds of books for what seems like an eternity. They are good books for kids and even a skilled performer can pull some good material from these books.[...]
1,Die right after 1 year,I got this product slightly over a year but didn't get the time to setup. I only kept it around 7 months and siren starting to ring. I call Buffalo they said its over the warranty.Very slow on coping.
2,mostly works,"I'd also heard good stuff about Buffalo, but this model seems like kind of a dog. I'll second that when you've got it media-serving (DLNA), the hard disk is constantly whirring. There are some kinks in its ability to do Mac file-sharing, mostly around its inability to properly do security settings between users. Using it for home networking, and if I accessed stuff through Apple protocols and family members used different usernames, there was no way to both have access to the the same things. Ended up using its SMB protocols, but the tech support said they'd look into this and release a firmware update. That was almost a year ago, no firmware updates since then. It's a little pokey for having an gigabit ethernet port."
1,Unreliable,"Worked well right out of the box. I connected it to my home network, and within a few minutes was able to connect from XP, Vista and Mac PCs. In the evening it was gone from the network. Re-powering and resetting did not help, and it doesn't even look like it goes through the normal boot up process. The drive is spinning, I can hear it, but it no longer connects to the network. It is being returned. For a device that was to house backups of all of my data, images, etc, it is too unreliable."
1,Linkstation is rubbish,"I have worn out a set of tyres taking my Linkstation to the retailer after repeated drive failures - 5 in 5 weeks.I found that, apart from the very dud mechanicals, the Manual was close to useless and the online advice very lackingI am now going out there for the last time to obtain a refund and buy a decent serverDo yourself a favour and DO NOT BUY BUFFALO"
4,Awesome Concept,"I like the concept of Network harddrive very much and used its 1 gen HDD for 3 years and now bought this one, lots of goodies but some nigglings.. Goodies we all know. let me get to problems which can easily be removed by firmware updates, I hope buffalo guys read reviews and learn out of it.- No idle time, so even if no one is using it, HDD won't go to standby mode which was available even in 1st generation.- speed of web interface is very slow, and performance of HDD is not awesome kind.- Turn on the pcast, it will keep rendering the HDD days and night, on what, u don't know, all you can hear id HDD rendering noices.- web access is turned on now, but its not grt, just workable.- not having good manual, how to use iTunes etc.- Pathetic support service, you send them email, they will get back only when you remind them about this email at their leizer.But I would still recommend this product."
1,Product Support is Terrible,"I waited on hold for 45 minutes before getting to tech support. I was told that my unit had a ""bad ROM"" - it doesn't even boot up (no front panel lights come on at all when turned on - even though the FAN does come on). The support engineer didn't seem at all surprised to hear about this.Based on the other poor reviews here, I'm not sure I even want to exchange this for another unit."
3,Decent Produce,"I researched this type of drive quite a bit. In my opinion the pro is that it's simple to configure and maintain. The con is that it can be a bit on the slow side, and the hard drive buzzes non stop."
4,Samsung SGH-T629 Snap-on Solid Black Crystal Case Cover with Removable Ratcheting Belt Clip,"item arrived quickly and as described, was easy to snap right onto phone. would definitely purchase from again. one problem, though? how do i remove it, say, perhaps if i decide to purchase a different color case cover?"
4,Nice protection for phone,"Bought this for my husband's phone. He likes the cover and it protects the phone well. The only drawback is the case is slightly raised and so the buttons on the phone are a little harder to use since they are now lower. But it only took a day to get used to it, so he does like the cover."
3,need help with the map,While the book is a great reference for the waterfalls in the white mountains I have a small problem. I purchased this book in 1995 but the map (near the table of contents) does not have an index so there is no way to tell what the circled numbers are for. Does anyone know if there is an index for the map on line anywhere?
3,Great Art but a strange mix of superheroes and super real problems,"I think the art of this book is great.I love Dodson works (he's as good as Adam Hughes), so I bought this after the MK Spider-Man hardcover and I'm not disappointed at all.The story is a strange mixture o superheroes and super real problems (some ideas on the superheroes or supervillains side seem to be used only to talk about the real problems). So I'd say: maybe it's not what you would expect from a Spider-man / Black Cat tale, but it's the kind of approach you'd expect from Kevin Smith. If you love him, you'll love this book."
1,"Oops, just wait for the full edition","I can see why this is being released as Kevin turned in the final 2 issues about 2 months ago and it is just awaiting artwork, by the Dobsons. So it's release of issues 4 and 5 (it was always meant to be a 5 issue series) should be out this year. This therefore has come out to renew interest in the story. It is a good story (so far) but not worth buying till they release the full one, probably by the end of the year. Kevin is apparently also finished writing Daredevil Target issues 2-5 and that is awaiting artwork too."
4,Fuses and a weekend in jail,"If I had known these fuses would lead to my arrest and subsequent weekend in the Maricopa County ""jail"" I would have never bought them. Just kidding, it was actually the Pima County jail.They're fuses. They'll hopefully blow up before my car burns down. If my car burns down I'll let you all know. They were the cheapest ones and that's what I look for most in fuses. What else is there to say?"
4,HMMMM,i dont know much of anything about fuses so dont take what i sy too heavily...but it seems well made...has a nice heft to it..more than youd think of such a small item...i put it in my scoshe fuse box and it fit nice and snug...lets hope it lasts awhile ;)
3,"Lots of fun, but didn't last long","Our island has been in the water (a small lake) less than a month and it has been fatally wounded by turtles (we think). Several really big chunks were taken out of one of the loading docks, and one of the inflation ports on the bottom of the main part was nearly destroyed. Plus, the mesh inset has already torn and it has not been subjected to any large groups or wild parties. We owned a similar style of island that we used during the last two summers, and the mesh insert didn't last on that island either, but it was never attacked, and never developed any type of leak. I think turtles are attracted to the yellow bottom :-(."
5,cheap and good,"this calculator really worth it. the screen is big. the price is cheap. and most importantly, it have all function I need!"
5,Good for FE exam,"I like this product, and also good for FE exam. But I suggest you need practice & become familier with the product before taking to exam."
3,Engineer,"Well I am a big Casio fan, having bought fx's for years, not to mention the 30 year old watch that continues to work perfectly to this day..... however, while it's a nice calculator, I bought it off Amazon because it had base conversions, something we use a lot in programing... imagine my surprise when I discovered that the binary conversion of 512 overflowed the registers. This is a very small number, not even 10 bits worth, which makes it uselessThe limitation was in the instructions... but not on the package or Amazon ad. That said, it's a great, easy to use advanced calculator, but it doesn't do me any good in the area I specifically bought it for. Still looking for now. Bound to be a casio somewhereIf you need binary/hex/decimal conversion, look elsewhere."
5,Everyone is jealous,"Everyone gets jealous when they see my FX-115MS with S-VPAM. Even the TI-89 jockeys get red in the face. This little math machine can do anything except graph with the same computational power as some of the big-boys at 1/10th the cost. Best calculator I've owned, hands down. Blows anything in the same price range by TI, Sharp, or any others right out of the water. I'm always finding new helpful functions as I take higher level math courses, it hasn't left me stranded ever.Good for chemistry, AP chemistry, geometry, precalc, calc, physics... I've had this little computer since freshman year of high school... Now I'm a freshman in college. I don't see anything else replacing it, except maybe the newest in the FX-*MS line, even in graduate school."
2,Solving quadratic and cubic equations,"Entering the EQN Mode and pressing the ""right arrow"" key, does not display the quadratic and cubic equation screen and as a result I can not solve these types of equations, which I need frequently.Other than this it looks yet ok to me.Thanks.Zaman."
3,disapointing description,"For many years, I used a Casio Scientific that had no battery. It meant that I had to be sure that there was some light (not much at that) in order to use it. It was stolen and I've been trying to replace it. This models description didn't indicate that it had or needed a battery so I bought it. It has a battery and indications from the (enclosed) directions seem to indicate that is required and must be replaced when it goes dead. there is little more irritating to me than having to find a special battery for something for many reasons. That, and the awkward ""case"" are the only faults I find with it but they are enough so that I find myself willing to give it away soon (before the battery ages or the case gets lost). I should point out that the calculator depicted FX1115MSPLUS doesen't have the BIG round button mine has and mine doesn't call itself ...PLUS. the one in the picture might be the one I ordered but didn't get. ??? I sure hope someone reads this... ."
4,Casio Fx-115ms plus,"great calculator, integrates, derives, solves, only problem is figuring out how to do this. But best calculator for the Fundamentals of Engineering Test."
2,Does not have natural display...,"The calculator is good though, but any other Casio can better than this in a much lower price. I just can't believe there are still calculators without natural display on sale... The Math display sucks.."
5,Great for CS students,"This is a great calculator for a computer science student. It converts between Decimal, Binary, Octal, and Hexadecimal. The screen is two lines and very easy to read. I really love it!"
3,"yes, but . . .","Nice calculator, but the loss of all formulas or expressions on shutdown is indeed crippling. You go to the bathroom, and that 44-character formula you were working with is gone.Also, the SOLVE function doesn't work as advertised in the manual, at least on my machine. The manual suggests that you can solve B = AC-1/2DC^2 using the SOLVE button. I could not get a prompt for the value of B. The only workaround I found is to make the expression equal to 0, with everything on the right side of the equals sign. Then I got a prompt for B, and it works. An explanation is perhaps that my Solve button doesn't connect (SHIFT-CALC) and I'm only getting the CALC function which works on expressions but not equations. I notice the Casio web manual leaves out the SOLVE function."
5,Good Buy!,This product was just what i was looking for and it got here in a very timely fashion. Was a great buy recomend it to everyone
3,GOT THIS ONE!,"Got the CD quickly. Some of the jokes were still funny, some were too hard to understand his speech. Ordred with another one of his CDs & there were too many repeats of material to justify having both."
4,Justin Wilson CD,"Enjoyed hearing Justin's voice again, especially his signature ""I Gawr-On-Tee."" He told many jokes, weaving layer upon layer until a humorous or surprise punch line. He also explained the historical origins of Cajuns. A nice CD to listen to.I Gawr-On-Tee"
3,Sigh...,"This book was helpful and all, but the story was really unsatisfactory. It's very easy to read, so if you have nothing better to do (which I don't), I guess it makes it hard to put down. I don't recommend it unless, of course, you need to study the SAT words. I did find that helpful, but it makes it a bit hard to remember all of them and their definitions because it's a pretty short book with 1000 SAT words, so it's all kind of jam-packed and it's a bit overwhelming.Also, I don't like the story because it was about a teenage girl trying to bust a highschool drug ring, so obviously they're going to talk ""like teenagers,"" but they're also trying to teach you these big SAT words, and it all ends up sounding, well, extremely stupid. No teenager would ever talk like they do in the book. I guess that's not really the point, but then if the book isn't good (it's also EXTREMELY predictable), learning the SAT words in it is just as hard as it would be without the book. See what I mean?"
4,Does what its supposed to,"This book is not the greatest in the world, plotwise. It does, however, have a tolerable plot. It does help a little if you want to brush up on your SAT vocabulary. I'd get it from a library if possible. No reason to read it more than once, unless you're really desparate for vocab help."
4,Busted,I had to read this book for my S.A.T. class and it realy helped me with the vocabulary. Not only was it an educating book but it was very interesting and I couldn't wait to see what would happen next. Even though it has many difficult vocab. words it was very easy to understand because the vocab. words are in bold and defined at the bottom of the page. I recommend this book to anyone who needs some help with their S.A.T. vocabulary.
3,SAT prep book busted helpful or not,i thought the book busted was very jejune. It wasn't the best because of the words being at the bottom of the page.It made it difficult to read and keep track because i would have to keep looking down. There was some parts that did help like the plethora of words that are used and the high school situation which makes it more interesting. It was an okay kind of way to learn but honestly i wouldn't choose it myself. It wasn't that kind of way to learn that your kind of excited about its just dull.I would actually perfer to use a song or a poem of some sort to better understand it.
5,swiss movment,"For anyone to speak of poor production values simply cannot know!! Ya had to of lived it... Was once a recording engineer. Now audiophile, DIY'er AND can say without hesitation, pay no attention to the ""critics"" on this one!!!!!"
2,Perfect music. Poor sound.,"This review is related to the Japanease release (mini-LP replica) of Swiss Movement.This is one of the greatest jazz performances. Spirit. Soul. Life. Drum. Ecstasy. But the sound quality is of big questione. Yes, it is dated to 60's. Yes, it was recorded at the concert. But the bonus track showcases how good the sound quality could have been on this release. On all other tracks you hear drums, keyboards and voice in your left channel and the horns in your right channel. Bass is almost not defined and is boom-boom box rather than a set of strings. The audience is in your right channel, too.This is a great piece of jazz (probably, a must have). But it is definitely not an audiophile record or even close to it."
5,"Hard Driving Funk,jazz","Les McCANN Together with Eddie Harris is an explosive force of hard driving funk-jazz,ingeniusiosly executed on this CD;a work of art as fine as a Swiss watch/Swiss Movement. THIS CD Moves the soul in a way that langers long after the music has ended. BILLY CLARK"
3,"Funky, but clunky","Right away I'll admit I only bought the CD for the soul jazz anti-establishment anthem ""Compared To What"". A true classic of a song, performed with inspiration that only a live setting could provide.McCann introduces the next song ""Cold Duck Time"" by basically apologizing for it in advance. Sure enough, it sounds like they haven't seen it before that day. Disappointing they couldn't have played it less mechanically, because it sounds like a great tune otherwise.The last three songs are all good, but don't quite return to the level of the first one. Eddie Harris plays well throughout, but Benny Bailey's trumpet sounds obnoxious at times; he's definitely not a subtle player.Still, this is one funky record overall, and it would have gotten another star if not for the atrocious recording quality. What a shame."
4,Good reference for solutions to diffusion equation,"If you are looking for mathematical solutions to diffusion equation under diffrent boundary conditions this is a good reference to have. For people interestted in numerical solutions and techniques this book may not serve the purpose other than getting analytical or approximate solutions to compare with their numerical implementation. There is a chapter on numerical methods, but the coverage is limited and it is introductory. Also, the book is not really about ""mathematics"" of diffusion - it is about ""solutions to diffusion equation"". To gain insights into solutions this is a very good book to read. In particular, there are discussions in this book on modeling diffusion in polymers that handle relevant aspects of the problem outside of just the math involved."
3,Still not an expert,"Crank has presented diffusion mathematics almost as well as Carslaw and Jaeger have presented heat conduction, although a bit less well explained."
5,great product; great price!,"Item was shipped on time, and works great. Great price, and easy to use. I like to cut my hair with this beard trimmer, since the additional settings allow my to better control the length of my hair!"
2,Great while it lasted,"Very easy, convenient to use but it only worked for about five months before the battery stopped taking charge. I'm waiting for a response from Remington to see if it's covered under warranty."
3,Not bad!,"This mustache and beard trimmer is not bad. For those close shaves, it gives a pretty neat and clean cut. But those beards that you want to be a little more longer and fuller, the trim is not as even as I would like.But overall, not a bad trimmer!"
5,Does the job the way it's supposed to,"I bought this item after the charger on my Philips Norelco T765 got toasted.The trim is quick and painless - powerful motor, effective blades. Construction quality is a notch above that of my old Philips Norelco T765. The wheel-adjusted height is a nice feature and very convenient. The blades come pre-lubed and seem of good quality. The head is relatively easy to clean. However, some product descriptions seem to imply that it is rinsable - which is absolutely not the case. So don't get fooled (like I did).Otherwise a good product that does the job well, and at a low price point. What else do we need?"
2,Battery near death,"I've been using this trimmer as my main tool for shaving since I bought it about a year and a half ago, using it once a week on average. Very happy until a few weeks ago, when I kept running out of power every time I'd shave.The battery won't retain its charge beyond the first 24 hours after charging (for however long). Problem is the trimmer doesn't work when plugged. So basically now every time I want to use the trimmer I have to charge it just before for at least half an hour, which makes it unusable for me.Still 2 stars because it wasn't a very expensive purchase."
2,"*not* corded, *not* washable","According to the Amazon description, this charger works either corded or cordless. According to the manual, the cord only works to recharge the battery. If the battery is dead, you can't use it even with the cord.Also according to the Amazon description, this has a washable design. According to the manual, you must not rinse the cutter assembly under water.But once you charge it up, and keep it clean with the enclosed brush, it does an okay job of trimming."
5,Great clipper!,After heart surgery I've decided to let my beard grow and this trimmer works great. I was concerned about getting trimmed too closely and perhaps getting nicked. Taking blood thinners can make getting nicked a real problem so was delighted that this trimmer allows us amateurs to work well and safely. Another triumph for Amazon!
2,"Worked Great, then battery died","Was quite happy with this razor for about 4 months. Then the battery started dying, slowing lasting for shorter and shorter time periods. Eventually it just stopped holding a charge at all. And on top of that, the plug doesn't supply enough power to use the razor, so it's pretty much junk now. Disappointing."
5,My husband loves it!!,My husband really likes this shaver and I am glad he purchased it. The shaver works well and I recommend it
5,Excellent,"so far it works great, it's remington i think you are going to be satisfied with this one. it doesn't have many parts so i love it 'cos they wont get lost!"
3,"Trims, but not easily","I had a rather bushy goatee and decided to trim it down to professional level. When using this product as advised I found it quite difficult to get through the hair. Using it in reverse of recommended works, but then you're not really able to pick the length. It definitely seems to struggle with hair of any real length or thickness. I'll be getting a different one for Christmas."
1,Battery kills it,"After about two years, the battery on this thing is completely shot, which makes the whole thing useless. Even when plugged in, I have to turn it off, wait a few minutes, then I get about 20 seconds of trimming before I have to repeat the process. It's been getting worse and worse, and today it finally got to the point where it's no longer able to do its job and is garbage.This would be a 4-5 star product if they had decided to use a battery that wouldn't make the product worthless after just two years. You get what you pay for."
2,Bad battery makes me wish I returned it right away,"This beard trimmer does a great job, but all of that is overshadowed by a dud battery. I have to plug this in the night before I plan to use it EVERY time (even if I want to use it the following day). The battery that came with mine never lasted more than about 15 minutes, which was really disappointing. Maybe I got a dud, but I wish I had returned for a refund right away instead of hoping it'd work better"
5,Just bought my 2nd. Better than I remembered it...,"I've been using the MB-200 for at least three years now. My previous one broke after I dropped it. I've noticed that other reviewers are saying that they had issues with the battery, but I haven't had any. I used my previous one at least twice a week for three years and I've never had a problem. For the money, I've never found a better model of trimmers. I feel that this is an excellent value, which is why I bought an extra one in case they discontinue the model. Great value at Amazon too."
4,"nice to handle , simple but well funtioned ,","MB-200 cool...I've tried to purchased from remington website before but there is no shipping to asia, product is in a good condition , i believed it will be last for a couple of years"
2,"Ok, but not worth it",Sort of flimsy and not particularly good at trimming. I used to have the MB 35 I believe and that was great. This one is no worth the money.
4,Good beard trimmer,This is a good shaver also. A bit to big. holds a charge for a long time and has sharp blades.
4,Gift,Gave this as a gift to my bf. Hard to find a device that's specifically for trimming your beard/mustache. He hasn't tried it yet so I can't say for sure how well it works. I'm only going by the reviews.
1,Junk,Remington used to make decent trimmers but now the cutters are so cheap that they're more likely to yank your hair out than trim it. Their customer service is horrendous. Never again.
1,Poor shaver,"the shaver really only does a poor-ok job. It does nothing to make maintenance of my beard easier. Seems there are cheap products at Walmart, just as good, cheaper."
5,Great for goatee and beard trimming.,"I just bought this to replace a larger trimmer I have had for a few years. I like this model a lot. The cutting length guide is small enough to easily trim under your chin and above your lip. There are no attachments, just the attached guide. I prefer it that way. I am tried of getting a bunch of plastic crap with every trimmer I buy when I just use one piece. It cuts hair well without tugging or pain. The adjustment wheel is like a mouse scroll wheel and functions a lot easier and smoother than most crude ""snapping"" adjustments on other trimmers. The only problem is that the guide doesn't appear to lock in place. Granted it takes a reasonable amount of force to adjust it and I don't think you will adjust it by pressing up against your face, but you could potentially bump / roll the wheel and adjust it inadvertently.I like the prodcut a lot for facial hair trimming. I have used 4 or 5 trimmers over the years and this is the best. It's pretty cheap too."
2,charger did not work,the shaver works just fine and i charged it the first time i used it and it worked but the second time i use it and went to charge it the battery wouldnt charge. i tried everything and even basically pulled it apart but still could not figure out why it wasnt working
4,Great Product 5 Stars Minus 1,"After owning several Wahl trimmers, I wanted something more reliable but didn't want to break the bank. This product is perfect and was on sale for $14.77. This product feels well built, the charge lasts for and weeks, and has nice adjustable guard for various lengths and for trimming sensitive areas that is also removable for precise beard and mustache trimming.My only reason for 4 star is the misleading ""Made in PRC"" label which I do not believe is a TLA (Three Letter Acronym) for ""Puerto Rico Commonwealth"" but more likely ""People's Republic of China."" Really Remington, are you really that concerned to have a ""Made in China"" sticker on your product when I believe all Apple products and just about every other high tech device I own was probably made there? 5 star product well built in China minus 1 star for trying to hide it."
2,Battery Problems with 3+ Trimmer,"Tried this trimmer for 3 years, a total of 3 trimmers. Every time, after 4-6 months of use, battery stops holding charge and have to charge 24 hours everyday for a 2 min usage. Put 25 more bucks and get a Braun... trust me, you wont regret."
1,Cordless but has to be charged before almost every use,"I like the form factor and it works fine for my beard, but the battery dies after about 48 hours. Since I only need to trim my beard twice a week, when I realize need it in the morning before work it is basically useless unless I remember to plug it in the night before."
2,Not very impressed,"I purchased this beard trimmer because I wanted something with more adjustability than most beard trimmers. The unfortunate part is that if you press the trimmer firmly against your face when you shave like I do, then settings 1-3 will be the same. They will be a setting 1 - the closest. Reason for this is the guard is very flexible and doesn't hold the 2nd and 3rd settings very well. Overall I do not like the weight, I think it is too heavy for what it is. I prefer the weighting of my Norelco G370 and this is still the best all 'round beard trimmer for my money."
4,Good value,"My bathroom doesn't have an outlet, but the local stores stopped carrying decent, inexpensive cordless beard trimmers, so I went with this one. The value for the price is excellent and so far it's held the charge well.My only (minor) issues are that the curved shape can be awkward when doing a pass against the grain. And It doesn't seem to cut well if only the front edge is flush against the face - the back edge of the guard needs to touch also."
4,Works just fine,"I have the previous model which seems to be pretty much the same other than for the cosmetics.Mine is at least three years old and gets used at least once a week. I tend to keep my beard short (about a #5 on the adjustment scale) and this trimmer does the job just fine. It cuts evenly and quickly and holds a charge for quite a while.One thing to be aware of is the need to lubricate the blades. I generally do a lube after two uses and I think that this is partially responsable for the reliability. It's also important to flip up the trimmer head and clean out the comparment underneath. A single drop of oil on the motor shaft helps here too. I use Wahl brand trimmer oil and a bottle will last the average user for years.The popup trimmer is a great feature when trimming my moustache as it lets me get into smaller spaces than the main cutter will.I keep wanting to ""upgrade"" to a more powerful trimmer, but this thing doesn't want to quit."
3,cheap but hurts,I just bought this mustache and beard trimmer about a month ago to replace my old dirty one. I cannot say its the best i have used but it gets the job done and its cheap. I mainly use to it to shave my beard and it cleans up pretty nicely. The head is adjustable so it doesn't need to be changed constantly. The drawback is that my skin hurts sometimes because of the plastic on the tips..
1,Horrid battery life from the very start - one to zero trims per overnight charge,"I had an old model just like this where the battery worked well and took a charge for years and years of use until it finally died. I could not find a new battery for it, so I got this one. This model from the very first time I used it had a horrid battery life. A full overnight charge would decay in hours and barely give a full trim - if any trim at all. I can't rate this low enough as it is useless with the no good battery - even with the charger cord plugged in at the same time you are using it."
1,Ok for about a year,"After a year of use for trimming sideburns, doesn't keep a charge and you can not use while it is charging."
3,One significant problem,Husband is pleased with beard trimmer EXCEPT that if battery is not charged it is impossible to use while plugged in. Obviously it is important to remember to charge trimmer on a regular basis.
3,Battery Died,"This trimmer worked great until the battery completely died and wouldn't hold a charge. For me it lasted a little less than a year before dying. I guess I shouldn't expect much from such a cheap product. Also, one annoying feature is that if the trimmer dies while you're using it, you can't just plug it in and continue use. You have to wait for it to actually charge."
3,"Ok, but the poor battery is a problem","The cheap battery in this thing is reason enough not to buy it. Trust me.You'll charge it per instructions, use it for 5 minutes, come back to it 2-3 days later and find there's 8 seconds of juice left before it disappoints you and forces you to charge it again. Oh, and you can't use while the AC adapter is plugged in. You have to wait for a charge....and before you say, ""all rechargeable batteries act that way!"". No, no they don't. My Norelco Spectra goes months on a single charge.Avoid this junk, even for the low cost."
5,Great shaver for a great price,"This does everything that I need it to. I use it to trim my sideburns and even my eyebrows. I still haven't figured out how to remove the guard, but I have only myself to blame as I have not even opened the manual."
1,Breaks easily when used without guard,"If you only plan to use it with the guard on, you're probably fine. If you plan to use it without the guard, especially for more intensive / multiple-angle tasks like head shaving, don't buy it. The top is designed so that if any significant pressure is placed on the blade when used in a pretty normal hand position, it can pop open. If it doesn't pop open, the plastic (!) pins in the hinge will break off. (The hinge is to allow you to open the top and clean out the hair around the driving pin.) I owned a prior model and it lasted for seven years of once-weekly head shavings with no guard, plus beard trimming. This version lasted barely six months before the first hinge pin broke, and less than a year before the second one broke, rendering the shaver unusable."
4,Hope the battery lasts!,"I've own at least three of these in the past. Sometimes the cutting guard breaks, other times the battery simply dies. I hope this one last longer. It works very well at the moment. I like the fact that it has so many length settings."
2,"Good functions, bad battery","I bought this trimmer 18 months ago to replace a Norelco that finally died after 10 years. The functions are great for trimming beard and mustache, but after only 18 months, the battery will no longer hold a charge more than a week or two. Nothing quite as delightful as getting halfway through trimming your beard before going to work on Monday morning and having the battery die halfway through! And BTW, it won't work on wall power; you have to wait for it to charge up enough to finish....I'm used to the fact that electronics are so cheap now that they're disposable, but this is insulting. No more Remington for me."
3,Almost there.,"I purchased this to replace a beloved MB-300 that I used for 4 consecutive years before leaving it in a hotel room. This model has failed to meet my expectations in a couple of ways:- There is no smaller mustache trimmer built-in.- It does not allow corded operations.This trimmer remains one of my favorite models because there aren't any parts to mess with or keep track of. I can easily adjust the length and, until now, I didn't need a separate tool for delicate regions like my mustache."
5,perfect,"If youre looking for a trimmer that adjusts to your mood, this one is perfect. With 9 different adjustment notches picking the right length for your hair is a snap. Feel like Gabby Hays, let it grow long and trim with a number 9. Feel like a jarhead fresh out? select down to a 2 or 3 and get a nice even stubble.Powerful (enough) motor, takes about 3 minutes to get a good job and it saves you telling the barber and wondering what youll look like when shes done. Strongly recommended!"
2,Disappointed.,"8 months after I bought the trimmer, it will barely hold a charge long enough to trim my beard. When half way through, you can actually hear the blades slow down. Plus this trimmer won't work when plugged in, so it's the rechargeable battery or nothing. Soon it will be in the trash. A big waste of money."
4,excellent,"Excellent trimmer. I use it 2-3 times a week for my beard, and once a month for my chest/back.The only complaint is that the battery tends to drain and die so I have to work quick and efficient while doing my chest/back.This could just be because I am a fairly hairy person."
4,nice,"awsome product i like the shaver and it is an really good product to shave with. very comforting and fast shipping item, cost effective"
1,"Works Well,....When it Works.","I guess I am not alone in my great dissatisfaction with the charging capabilities, or lack thereof, with this unit. What is Remington thinking, really? Of what use is a product that seems capable of many good years of service, yet in about a year, can no longer be used without first charging it up every day or two. That it can't be used while plugged in, unless it's already charged, compounds the frustration & annoyance! No matter how long it's charged, even overnight, it will not hold a charge for more than a day, two at the most. And when it's dead, even plugging it in does no good. I doubt Ill ever buy another Remington product again, for even the shaver works well, which this one does, if it can't be used when needed, what's the point?"
4,Uni-tasker!,"This trimmer is good for one thing, and one thing only: trimming your beard. The blade is wider than theWahl 9918-6171 Groomsman Beard and Mustache Trimmer, which is both good and bad. It is a little quicker to trim with, but not as maneuverable. The built-in guard is great; no more rooting around in a drawer looking for attachments.The only think I don't like about it, as a beard trimmer, is the handle shape. It has a weird bend that makes it awkward to hold in some positions (mostly when doing my neck, but also the offhand side of my face).Don't think about using it for anything else, though. The blade is too wide to trim your mustache. Or your ears. I tried several times to use it without the guard, always with bloody results.I'm getting the smaller Wahl to use in conjunction with this. Neither one is perfect, but together they cover my needs pretty well."
5,Happy with MB-200 beard trimmer,"I had been using an old beard trimmer, and finally replaced it with the MB-200. The old one had been yanking my beard hairs, incredibly uncomfortable. This one just whips through and quietly, efficiently trims everything just right. It is SO much better! It lasts a long time on a charge. I don't trim my beard every day, so a single charge will last at least a month. I had really been hoping for one that took rechargeable AA or AAA batteries, but this is absolutely fine. Maybe I will need to throw this one away in 10 years, when the battery fails; if so, still a wonderful purchase."
2,Not what I had in mind,"When my Wahl wore out, I went looking for a substitute. I got this prooduct. The two things I don't like about it are that it won't work when plugged in with the charger -- the charger simply recharges the battery. So if you want to use this thing, you have to make sure it is plugged in and charging for at least an hour before you use it. The other thing I didn't like is that it cuts unevenly. I have to do my own scissors trim after I use this because some hairs are not trimmed. I wish I hadn't bought this and just ordered a new Wahl brand -- one which supplies power through the outlet cord and cuts evenly."
3,"Good Price, but not high quality.","Purchased this to replace a similar but older model. I actually looked for this style, because it is easy to adjust. Unfortunately, it is more flimsy and louder than the original. A couple teeth have broken off guide and it did not come with a carry case. Battery depletes fast as I always need to use it plugged in. I will replace it with a better model, but now that it is even cheaper, it can't be beat for $14 bucks."
2,"Cheap, but also fragile",As a beard trimmer goes this does the job. Apparently though if you snap on the removable guard with any kind of force it will break the 9 level system and leave you with only one. If you treat the trimmer very gently I don't see this being an issue hence the two star rating.
5,Updated version of faithful product,"This appears to be an updated version of a Remington trimmer that served well for many years.After a months use, I can report that the stability of the trim length setting has been improved, and the trimmer blades no longer require lubrication. The quality of the beard trim is also improved, allowing for rapid trimming.If this new trimmer is as durable as my first, I will more that satisfied."
2,Works great but-,"The good: the trimmer works great!The bad:1) no charging stand.2) it has the short life NiCad batteries instead of the more modern NiMh.3) the recycle law has been met by the letter rather than the spirit of the law. The batteries which will last not much more than 2 years are soldered in. Thus when the batteries go south, you can cut them out but likely most people will not be able to solder in replacements. Thus a product that could last 10 years is likely in the trash at three years."
1,Broke after 3 uses..,I had an old $20 beard trimmer prior that lasted years until I lost the adapters. This thing basically came apart in my hand after the 3rd time using it. Look elsewhere..
3,It's alright. Doesn't really do a great job,"I am not sure why Remington and other companies find it so hard to make a good shaver. This model feels cheap and plasticky and it acts like one. If you want a really fine grain, it'll be tough to obtain. Areas on my neck look like someone clutched hair and randomly pulled it out. I have patches of skin and hair. The shaver works better on the cheeks, but fails around the chin. I bought a newer model, with touchscreen and USB charging no less, and it fares worse than this. Everything is flimsy. I would invest in more $$ and get a Philips or something. I am done with Remington."
1,"Junk. Maybe it used to be good, but not anymore.","I haven't had this thing for very long, about 1.5 years. I only use it once every couple of weeks to trim my beard. It will not hold a charge anymore. I have to plug it in every time I want to trim and let it charge for a couple hours beforehand, because as other reviewers have noted: it won't operate on A/C power. So if the battery goes, the whole thing is worthless even when plugged in.To its credit, it trims pretty well. But once the battery goes, it's a paperweight. Buy something else."
3,Great trimmer with a weakness,"I loved this beard and mustache trimmer. The built-in length adjuster works great and is a great feature, but the battery's lifespan is the Achilles heel.The NiCad batteries only lasted me about 2 to 2 1/2 years before giving up altogether. A NiMh or Li-Ion battery would make this a much better unit for the long haul.I guess I can't be too mad about a $25 trimmer though, hence the 3 stars. I'm even considering getting a new one to replace Wahl that I'm currently using."
4,Easy Trim,This is convenient and keeps a charge very well. I gave 4 stars because it is a hassle to clean. I wish I bought one years ago. Excellent quality as well.Update:A few months short of the 2 year mark it suddenly decided to not want to turn on. Dropping it probably doesn't help. Oh well.
3,"Decent, Simple Trimmers","These are decent trimmers. The comb is a bit too coarse for my liking, but it basically just means I need to do an extra pass or two. They get the job done, but they're nothing special. I'm a pretty low maintenance person, and these meet my needs."
2,uneven,"uneven cutting, no mater what setting as the comb is to wide, and with it removed it cuts your skin."
2,It is ok but,I had one before this one that was smaller and so much easier to work with. It dropped onto the floor and never did work right after that. I tried to find the same thing but looks like they quit making that model. This one is just not nearly as easy to use. I really liked that other one. I am the wife that gets stuck doing the trimming around the beard etc.
3,TOO sharp,"this is my 3rd remington of this model. the newest version works great, but i've been shocked at how SHARP the blades are. when i use it without the cover it cuts my face and i even slit open my finger when trying to remove hair from the blade. It's needlessly sharp. not happy about this newest change."
5,Remington MB-200 Titanium Mustache and Beard Trimmer,"I got this for my son for Christmas. He has tried many different kinds, and says this is the best one he has ever used. I am a huge fan of Amazon and do a lot of shopping on this sight. They have never let me down!"
5,Superb on stubble!!,"So, the current style on men is having some stubble on your face but still groomed. Meaning shave your neck line and above the cheeks so you still look clean cut. Anyways, I wanted a trimmer that would give me that ""in"" look of having stubble, but still be office appropriate. Well, this thing does the job splendidly! I use number 3 on my sideburn area and then #2 everywhere else for a quick, precise, and stylish trim. Love this thing, perfect for that modern look of stubble yet groomed.Pros-really inexpensive-trims evenly and with precision-never any pain or pulling-easy to clean-holds it charge for a long timeCons-should of bought one years ago;-)"
5,Great beard and hair trimmer,PowerfuL and really easy to use.. It has multiple settings that stay in place even with applied pressure. Works great for my haircut and trimming my beard. There is not a docking station just a simple plug. Not a big deal but if you keep it out on your counter it could look sloppy.
2,batteries don't last long,"Initially, this thing works great. Holds a charge, does its job, etc. But after only 22 months the batteries no longer hold a charge for more than a few seconds. Nothing else is worn out and there's no way to replace the battery yourself. I think a ~$30 trimmer should last longer than that."
3,A more rigid guard would earn 5 stars.,"What to say. It's got a nice strong motor so no snagging, just clean cuts, the battery charges fast and holds for a decent amount of time, the guard is easy to use, what with the click wheel, and easy to pop off, no risk of losing multiple small guards.However the guard itself is a big of a problem. The ""teeth"" of the guard are super, super soft. Any amount of pressure will cause them to be pushed down, lowing a 5 level to a 3 and a 3 to a 1 and so on. If the guard were made of a harder, less flexible plastic, I'd give it five, as it is, you have to be super, super gentle and not put any pressure on it, otherwise you'll end up with patches of your beard shorter than in other spots where you used a lighter touch."
2,Not good,"I would not recommend this trimmer if you expect to get clean edges. For short haircuts you need to go over the same area many times in different directions. I also don't like battery operated trimmers, as when the battery dies, you need to need to replace the battery. In this case you can't do that, you need to pay the manufacture to replace the battery. Buy one with a cord."
5,An excellent trimmer,"I had been using a Schick Quatro razor with a trimmer on the back, and it had many disadvantages, including a poor battery life, the hair getting caught, and not a good cutter in general. Plus it took a long time to trim. So I was looking around for a beard trimmer, and I saw this one. I read the reviews of others, and it was a good price, so I figured I'd give it a try. The first time I used it, I was truly amazed. The trimmer is nice and quick. The blades don't need to be oiled which is really cool. I liked how the trimmer has nine adjustable settings, and the #1 setting cuts the hair really short. I'd recommend using the #3 or #4 for a nice short cut. And at $30 (this was the price at the time I purchased it), it was a great deal. If you're looking for a good trimmer that doesn't need to be oiled and is a quick and easy and clean way to trim a beard, this is the trimmer for you."
4,Battery Needs Improvement,It does everything just fine but after using 10-15 mins straight the battery seems to go low. If you are going to trim your entire body hair then this is not the product you want to buy...It is perfect for trimming facial hair :D....
3,better but not great,"I replaced a very old Norelco that served me well for over 5 years. I tried the version of the Norelco that replaced mine and found it was terribly made. It looked like the cheapest possible plastic available in the world and felt lousy in my hand. The cut from the blade was good but I didn't like the little hinged blade guard. It just got in the way and added nothing positive. This Remington feels much heavier and sturdier. It feels better to hold and seems to give a decent trim to my mustache and beard. Its not as good as my old one, a little rougher but I prefered it slightly to the new Norelco version."
3,good but low battery life,"Great quality, nice shape, but the battery life on this thing is just horrible. It lasts a LOT less than their last model I owned."
1,Garbage,"After 5.5 solid years with my previous Remington trimmer, I expected a similarly pleasant experience with the 200. Instead I have had only problems.It's one plus: it shaves well.On the negative side: it only shaves well when it's plugged into a wall socket. Thankfully, my beard is short, I couldn't even imagine using it for thicker hair.Though it shaves nicely when plugged-in, the charger burnt out after 3.5 weeks. The batteries proceeded to last only two shaves without a recharge. What if I was away on a business trip?Either I had great luck with my first Remington or miserable luck with the newest Remington."
2,"Good trimmer, horrible battery","The trimmer itself is great. Numerous depth adjustments and the guard can be removed for sideburns or detail work. However, the battery will not hold a charge for more than 2 days. I only trim my beard once a week, so I have to charge the trimmer before every use (minimum of 2 hours charging for 2 minutes of trimming operation time). If this trimmer was simply a corded model it would be fine. Since it's battery only and can't work when connected to the outlet (until the battery is charged), it's frustrating. It works (in it's own special way) and my pride won't let me replace a working machine. I'm patiently waiting the day when it dies so I can get a different trimmer with a working battery or a cord. Save yourself the $25 and pass on this one."
3,Not Washable as Claimed,"I like this unit - I owned a similar Remington model for several years, and was happy with the job it did. Other units I have tried in the past year have left me frustrated, so I was happy to purchase another Remington.However, one of the most attractive things about the newer model was that Amazon's product description page clearly stated that the head was washable. (In fact, this was stated more than once.) However, upon receiving the item, I find that the enclosed instructions specifically advise you not to rinse the cutter assembly under water. I know that the space under the cutter head can be cleaned with the supplied brush, but I find the process unpleasant.The other minor drawback to the MB-200 is that, unlike my older model, it cannot be operated with the cord attached. The adapter cord only recharges the batteries.So overall a good product, but not quite as advertised."
2,This is junk. Buy something else.,This thing is a piece of junk. The angle of the cutter makes it extremely difficult to trim your beard without pulling the hair out or catching on your skin.
2,Only worked for 6 months,I really like this trimmer and it did the trick very simply but the jog wheel stopped working after 6 months and it has a short battery life. Other than that I really liked it compared to any other trimmer i have used and am buying another one.
1,Remington beard trimmer,"The trimmer would not take a charge. I contacted Remington and they sent me a replacement charger and cord, and a return prepaid shipping label, if needed. New cord and charger arrived; unit would still not charge. Have returned unit for replacement. Was told to expect its arrival in about a week. Waiting."
5,The BEST beard trimmer available,"I have owned several different beard trimmers over the years and this one is by far the best. It is well built, works great, and is just a fantastic trimmer all around. I own 2 of these. Great job, Remington !!"
2,Deeply Disappointed,"The trimmer just does not do a good job. I went over my beard and head at least 20 times and each time got a bit more trim. After the ~20 times my hair and beard looked neat, but that is not what I expect from a highly rated trimmer. It does not matter what angle or how fast you move the trimmer - it consistently does a poor job.As other customers have noted, ""You get what you pay for, and in this case it is not much."""
1,How the mighty have fallen,"I had a Remington trimmer for many years which I loved. It was incredible, always fast and sharp. When I lost it, I bought this model, but I was really surprised by how badly it cut. It will NOT cut close to the skin AT ALL. It was not able to cut the hair under my nose, and it will simply not cut closer that 1/4 inch because of the way the blades are positioned. So if you need to get close to the skin, for example under the nose or down on the neck, you're going to be screwed by this shaver. Not to mention that it pulls like the dickens. I am just perplexed by what Remington has wrought."
1,Worthless,"Battery has never held a charge more than a day or two. I have had it for about two months. Last week it would not hold a charge for more than a couple hours. Went to trim my beard today, after having trimmer plugged in overnight, and the trimmer died within a minute. Big PIT to have a section of beard shorter than the rest. I should have returned this to amazon within the 30 days, my fault."
1,Most pathetic trimmer i ever purchased....,"I purchased this to gift it to one of my cousin in India and after checking the reviews I was very confident that this will be a great gift. Not exaggerating, it started but it just doesnt solve the purpose. I have been using Panasonic ES224s from last 3 yrs and its blade is still much better than this piece of junk. I am not sure if my piece is faulty or what but it just dont work....it was just so embarrassing to gift something which just dont work.."
2,Remington MB-200,"I didn't quite like it. I needed a stubble look and this one had a guard that prevented me to get that stubble look i was looking for. I got another one that is specifically for stubble by Nerelco. Much, Much better than this one. Brice was good."
3,Not really a mustache trimmer,"I bought this a gift for my husband; overall, he thinks the product would be good for beards, but just fair for mustaches. You can't get the little details with this product, so for mustaches, he would say not so good."
2,"Not as pictured, cheap","I owned a previous version of this shaver that was very similar to image on this site. I lost the charger for my old Remington MB-45 so I decided to order a new one. What I received instead was the cheap black and grey version of the MB-200 shaver, which is available directly from Remington at half the price I paid on Amazon. Cheap and poor quality version of this shaver. From now on I make this purchase locally and in person so I know what I am buying. MB-45 is a quality product, but no longer available, MB-200 is a cheap, poor immitation."
4,"Works good, but can be a bit big",This works as advertised but I wish there was a smaller end to it for trimmer my mustache.Otherwise a great product that holds it's charge very well.
5,I recommend this 100%,"I am 100% satisfied with this purchase. I honestly don't have a single complaint and could not think of a single thing i would change on this razor. I use it to trim my goatee and it's perfect. It does what it's supposed to do. It's got different settings for length. Simple, basic, gets the job done. It's not rocket science. It's just a trimmer, but it works. I recommend this 100%."
1,Battery can't hold a charge,"Great at first, then the battery can only hold a charge for 3 minutes. Not happy about the product, but guess that is what one can expect from Remington. Still looking for a replacement..."
5,Long lasting and very reliable,"Love this thing, I've had it for over 2 years and it still holds a great charge. For the price you won't find a better trimmer."
4,Great trimmer,"Works great. My only complaint is that the instructions on how to actually trim your beard with the trimmer (how to hold the trimmer, etc) are somewhat lacking. If you're new to trimming beards like me, you could easily wind up chopping off more hair than you wanted to, if you're not very careful."
4,Perfect.,Coulnd't find these in Canada anymore and was really happy to find it at Amazon. Was there within a week and it's the newer model of the one I had for years.
3,Breaks way too easily,"Works great, but the part with the trimmer blade breaks off to easily if dropped. I've had 3 of these...all of 'em broke when I dropped them.I'm done with this one!"
4,Buzzzzzz,"Work well, trims quickly and efficently. When are they going to go wireless on this small type of hand appliances"
3,Battery doesn't last,"This is the second Remington beard trimmer I have owned and the batteries in both stopped taking a re-charge after about two years use. Not coincidently there is a two-year warranty, and this one died almost exactly two years from the purchase date. When it is running it works very well in trimming my beard, but I don't like having to replace it every two years."
1,One of the worst shavers I've ever bought,"I bought this trimmer in November as my beard was getting fairly long and I wanted it to get trimmed. I put it on the longest hair setting (9) and it starts taking off large swathes of hair. What gives, Remington? Playing around with the settings didn't help, it just got progressively shorter. But I wanted to keep my beard, not look like I had five o'clock shadow! So disappointed in this product. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."
1,Battery gives out,"Battery gave out fairly quickly before it wouldn't hold a charge for less than five seconds. I had to open it up to fix and decided it wasn't worth spending the money to buy a new battery and solder it back on, instead I by passed the battery and applied 5V directly to the trimmer. Putting it together though was hard as once you open it stuff moves around because as aforementioned it is cheaply made. Would not recommend because it could not tolerate a once a week trim for a more than a few months. Also it cannot be used while charging so once you batteries blow you lose your trimmer essentially."
2,Unexceptional,"It takes a dozen passes of a spot for it to create a uniform length.You can't use it while it's charging.You can't use it with water.The available lengths for it are too far apart - the 0 leaves you with almost no hair, and the 1 leaves you with a week's worth of beard.However, on the bright side, it is fairly cheap (though I assure you, you get what you pay for)"
1,battery failure,"the rechargeable battery on my unit failed, as well, within a couple of months. this seems to be a recurring theme with this product."
1,Stopped holding a charge < 6 months after I bought it,"For the first six months, it worked fine. I'd used it a half-dozen times before it ran down and needed to be charged. Now, it always needs to be charged, and even after being plugged in for two days, it still only runs at half-speed."
1,Battery fails quickly,"As other reviewers have said, the trimmer's battery is terrible. After about three months of using the trimmer once a week, several hours of charging gives me about a minute of shaving time."
5,So far so good,So far so good. Had for about a month and works as expected. No frills. Just a good electric trimmer.
2,inferior replacement for mb-300,"Bought to replace mb-300 with dying battery, the ergonomic design remains the same, but the plastic used for the variable length comb mechanism is cheap and flimsy. It lacks the pop up detail function of the mb-300. Quality of construction has deteriorated considerably. It's serviceable, but not worth the cost."
3,"Good price, but won't buy one again","When this dies, I'll look to another company. As a trimmer, it's fine, but the battery leaves much to be desired. I probably use it once a week, and have to remember to plug it in to charge before I want to use it, or else the battery will be nearly empty (when plugged in, it only charges the battery, it won't run from being plugged into an outlet)."
1,Dead after minimal use,"Like many people on here, the product just stopped working one day. I've had it for maybe 2 years, but only use it ~1x per month. It no longer charges or runs. I got maybe 20 uses out of it."
2,Pay For What You Get,"I should have known this thing would fall apart quickly from the price point.Pluses: cheap.Minuses: Poor battery life- held charge for 1-2 uses max; the clipper head was constantly falling off; trimmer guard length apparatus finally broke, rendering this thing mostly useless.Stay away from this one, spend a little more money and get something higher quality that will last you more that six months."
2,Horrible Battery,I owned the previous model of this trimmer for many years.The charge held for a very long time and for weeks in between uses.The current model looses it's charge in a matter of days.
2,Doesn't hold a charge!,"Good price, great adjustability, perfect size but will not hold a charge.Every time I take it out of the bathroom drawer to use the battery dies after 3 seconds of being turned on. I then have to charge it before every use which is very inconvenient.It's also louder than a few others trimmers I have owned."
2,Loved it - till the battery wouldn't hold a charge,"Worked great for at least a year. Now the battery won't keep a charge, so it's a worthless. It doesn't work plugged in while you are charging it either. Frustrating."
2,battery dies quickly,"As a trimmer its great, but after one year the battery holds a charge for about one or two uses, and you cannot use this corded, for whatever reason. You cannot use it while the charger is plugged in. Seems like a waste, as the product is more or less disposable because of this."
2,Works but cheaply made,"It works well enough but every time I go to clean the thing, the blade portion falls off. You can look and see how very cheaply this itty bitty plastic piece is. It's only a matter of time before it wears out, breaks and makes the razor unusable. I'm just sick of the cheapo plastic designs. Again, the razor works as advertised, but it's just more cheap plastic waiting to break."
1,Bad experience,"Let me start off by saying that the product worked fine the first couple of days. I was very pleased with it. However, after 2 weeks it started having some problems with the battery. Somehow the trimmer kept turning off whenever I put it at a specific angle against my face. I recharged the battery many times but nothing fixed it. The machine turned off at some positions and at others it worked fine. I tried to take it apart to see if it was a problem with the battery but the screws were of the worst quality. They immediately lost all grip and I found myself with no other choice but to buy another trimmer. I have read many good reviews about this product but in my particular opinion I had very bad experience with it. Hope it helps any of you who are about to buy this product."
2,Battery is worthless,Battery won't hold charge after a few months. Worst part is that it won't even work if it's plugged in - you have to charge it immediately before you use it and then be completely done within 15 minutes or so when the battery will have died.
4,Excellent Beard Trimmer - Not 220v Friendly,The Remington MB-200 is as excellent a trimmer as reviewers state. Unfortunately it isn't world class friendly. In fact it's the only gadget I've purchased in years that is 120 volts only. This is surprising given that a trimmer would be a common travel item.
3,"Eh, ok.","For the price, this was an ok investment. It is compact, but it doesn't hold a charge very well. If it's out of juice, you can't just plug it in and run it. You have to wait for it to charge and then run it. In addition, the beard trimmings go everywhere. In the end, the hassle of this device lead me to shave off my beard. It's easier to just shave in the shower, plus I look 10 years younger."
1,This trimmer arrived used.,"When I opened this trimmer the inside plastic bag was torn open and there were cut beard hairs in the blades. Naturally, I returned it, but it's annoying for me to have to do that when I ordered a supposedly new product. Also, I wonder why Amazon is not refunding my postage. Now I have to chase that down. In their defense, this is the first time (and hopefully only) that something like this has happened to me."
5,My boyfriend loves it!,"I bought this product because my boyfriend seriously needs to trim his beard. There's a lot of trimmers out there but I chose this one specifically because of the balance of price, and functionality. In terms of price, it is inexpensive compared to other trimmers. The trimmer is an all in one beard trimmer meaning you don't need to keep multiple heads so there is no worry to misplace or lose some parts. It looks solid and sturdy. It is rechargeable. You can wash the head. It is cordless. The blades are self-sharpening.He got his gift yesterday and he loves it because it is so simple, so easy to use, so portable yet meets his needs to trim his facial hair perfectly."
2,you get what you pay for,"The cord is a cheap deal you have to unwind each time - not the curly kind.The battery does not last long, and when it does die, it dies all of a sudden, without warning and you can't use it while it's plugged in.It's pretty noisy, noisiest i've ever owned.Yes, it works, but really, i wish i hadn't bought this thing. It's not a rip off, it's cheap, and you get what you pay for so if you're broke, i understand, i am too and it's why i bought it but now i regret it and wish i'd just man'd up and dropped more ona better one, of course can't find one made in Germany or USA anymore, all heco in china which means they have useless chinese batteries in them."
5,Trimmed and terrific!,My husband has had a beard for 32 years and says this is the best trimmer he has ever used. Fits the hand well. The down side: he wishes it had a stand to sit in.
5,Best Beard/Hair trimmer on the market,"I have been using this model for years to trim my hair. Best I've ever used, mainly because the selector dial for length lets you clearly see and set your desired length .... AND IT NEVER ACCIDENTALLY SLIPS TO A DIFFERENT LENGTH/POSITION.Last very long time (not forever, but several years of regular use without any problems)"
3,decent mid-grade trimmer,"This is a decent -- and at the time I bought it, impressively inexpensive -- trimmer, but does have some limitations.Pros: Adjustable guard; on sale for cheap.Cons: Modest power (can choke a bit on my thick beard); does not trim especially close with the guard removed; no dock for charging."
2,Battery died after 3 months,"I love this trimmer, but it's not working anymore. it has a nice feel to it and it has the right settings.i just bought it about 3 months ago."
1,I have a problem,"I have got this item and I like it very much, but problem is that charger is not working at all. Please give me advice."
4,Don't love it or hate it,"I have had this razor for a couple of months, not my favorite but gets the job done.I do like that the head is adjustable so I don't have to constantly switched heads when trimming my hair.I mainly use this for my beard, I have used better but for the price I paid I would buy it again.Other Thoughts: It kind of hurts my face because of he hard plastic on the tips of the razor, this defiantly makes me go slower, I like to shave and get it over with."
4,nice for the price,"As others have said - this is great trimmer at a very good price point. It's compact, light weight with plenty of settings to get the cut length you desire. Not sure how easy it is to clean - will update the review once I've used it for a few months."
4,Rotate a trim,"I like this trimmer better than my previous one because with this one all I have to do is rotate a dial to select the length of hair to be cut. With my old one, I had to change the covers to do that. To get the right length with the new one, I started with the highest setting and worked my way down.The trimmer could be a bit smaller, but it looks well built. If it is like the Remington shavers I've had, it should last a long time."
2,Doesn't hold charge,"When the trimmer is working properly, it works wonderfully. The trimmer has plenty of power, and the trim adjustment range is more than adequate for me. Where it falls short, however, is in its ability to hold a charge. Like several other reviewers, mine worked great for the first few weeks, but now it only runs at full power (for about 10-15 seconds). It seemed like a great trimmer for the price, and it would be if it weren't for its inability to hold a halfway decent charge."
2,Remington MB-200 Beard Trimmer,"I was a little hesitant to buy this trimmer after reading some of the reviews. I'm glad I bought it. It has worked well for me. I didn't give it 5 stars simply because I had nothing to compare it with. This was the first time ever I grew a beard. I found the settings worked very well and was able to get a nice even trim and lots of complements.**Update: I reduced this form 4 stars to 2 stars simply because the battery does not hold a charge, and you can't use it while plugged in to recharge. I have some time ago shaved off my beard."
5,Perfect mustache and beard trimmer for the money,"I recently started growing beard and mustache. After reading positive reviews, I bought this from Amazon. It did not disappoint me. It gives a perfect trim in 5-10 minutes. After one full charge, I was able to get 6 trims. It is definitely well worth the price. I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a mustache and beard trimmer."
2,broke in 2 months,"It was really great while it was working. Then, the trimmer adjustment broke. Didn't even make it to month 3. I only use it once every two weeks. It wasn't abused or anything... just garbage.Update: Remington must have missed my first email, but promptly responded to my second. They are sending me a new unit in 7 - 10 business days. If the new one works out, I'll update my review. Regardless, not being able to use a trimmer for over two weeks is extremely inconvenient."
2,Works for a year before the battery won't hold the charge,"I enjoyed this trimmer for about a year. It cuts at multiple levels, holds at the levels, is easy to clean, etc.However, after a year, I have to charge it every time I want to use it. #inconvenient"
2,Flimsy/weak head design,"After less than a year of use, I have experienced the weak battery claims that other users report, and I just tried to move the head back to clean it, and it broke off and the trimmer is no longer usable. Very poorly designed."
2,Would not buy again,It's great when it's fully charged but you have no idea when it's going to die on you. The LED simply lets you know that you plugged it in. I LOVE only doing half my beard and the thing dies on me. It wouldn't be that big of a deal if you could use it while plugged in but when they say cordless they mean cordless only. Next time I'm getting one with a battery indicator or one that will work while charging.
4,"Great product, short battery life","I've enjoyed using this, however the battery does not last very long. Not the end of the world considering you can plug and shave."
3,"Cuts awesome, but eventually just dies","This is my third one of these. I love these things--I love the shape and way it cuts, but the battery on these things eventually just dies, to the point where you cannot use it without having it plugged into the charger, and then, eventually, it will barely work when plugged in. For me, it has taken at least a year for this to happen though, therefore justifying the relatively cheap cost compare to more fancy trimmers. I will buy more, even when my third one croaks in a year or so, unless I can find something better, which I haven't : )"
1,Broke within two months,The adjustable length scroll wheel broke within two months of me owning this. The scroll wheel is made of plastic and is easily stripped. Save your money and buy something else.
5,Works Great!,"I like the staying and the way it feel in my grasp. The dial is also very effective in creating a finely nuanced beard. I wish it had a nose hair attachment, though."
5,"Excellent tool, but tough to read the numbers",Pros:Adjustable cut length that trims consistently.Holds its charge for many trims.Trims close to nostrils.Cons:Quite hard to read the cut length indicator number.
1,Worked for just over a year,The rechargeable battery on this has pretty much died in just over a year. After that I got only one or two trims on a full charge! The genius who designed it didn't even ensure that it will work when it is plugged in. After a couple of trims when it loses charge I need to plug it in overnight so I can use it again for the next couple of times. What a waste!I am back again shopping for a trimmer.
3,Good trimmer; lousy battery,"The trimmer operates well. Does the job. But the battery is ni-cad and does not hold a charge well, which pretty much ruins an otherwise good product."
1,Not recommended.,Used this trimmer probably less than a dozen times - for just a few minutes each time and the motor has already died. What a waste of money.
2,Terrible Battery,"The razor cuts, and I appreciate that the guides are built in (and therefore, not lost), but the battery trumps all. I use it only once or twice each week and it cannot hold a charge between shavings. Since you can only use it from battery, you have to plan ahead and start charging it several hours before you plan to use it. Probably fine if you shave daily, or if you don't mind leaving it plugged in all the time, but nearly useless for my less frequent uses."
5,Awesome purchase!,"This is great. It was a lot better than I expected for the money I paid for it. If you're looking for a decent basic trimmer, this is it."
4,Great Trimmer,"This is my second MB-200 that I've owned. The first one was amazingly convenient. It held a charge for around a month. With no accessories, it was great for traveling. Unfortunally my cats knocked it off of the sink with the guard extended. It broke a small piece inside and the guard doesn't work anymore. So I suggest to store it with the guard all the way in so that can't happen. Other than that, I'm completely satisfied."
5,Great! (esp. compared to the MB-250),"My first trimmer was the Remington MB-250; bought one for myself and my son. These were terrible - Mine would give one trimming per charge. The one I got my son also gave one trimming per charge --- and ran at half speed! Clearly a poorly designed product. The MB-200 however is a different story. Both of the units I bought have performed flawlessly. I get about eight or nine trimmings per charge! Compared to the lousy MB-250, you wouldn't think the MB-200 was made by the same company. Or, maybe the guy who designed the MB-250 was fired."
4,Trimmer,Good product for the price for sure. I have bought others and would buy more. This one was not a top quality one though and had a mechanic problems so we shall see.
3,Has stopped keeping a decent charge,"I bought this in september, maybe used twice a week since.Now recently even after a full charge i'm lucky to barely get 5 minutes of use out of it before it dies. I'm done using remington products have had maybe 3 or 4 shavers die on me, now this. Seems like a quality trimmer, but if it cant keep a full charge its useless to me."
1,Not worth the money,"Even after reading some of the weak reviews, I figured there would be no harm in spending about $30 on a beard trimmer. Howeverm like a lot of the other feedback, this shaver worked about 10 times, before promptly dying after being turned for 3 seconds each time. I do want to note that I charged it overseas (where I live) using an adapter. This has never impacted any other appliances I've purchased, but I did want to note it. My recommendation: spend a few more $$'s, and get something that will last"
4,"Good product, but same price in other stores with no wait.....","Just got it today, and tried it out, so far so good!!! It's very comfortable, a clean shave with no pulling, and it's convenient that everything is in one piece!!!! The only downside is that my buddy bought the exact same thing at Walmart for the same price! Would have been five stars, but minus one for offering it at the same price as Walmart!"
1,Dead after less than four months.,"I recently replaced a four year old version of this, when the batteries stopped holding a charge. Now I'm thinking I should have sprung for a better one, since this died after only four months.I just emailed their customer service, we'll see if they do anything for me."
3,"Great battery life, but not for precision trimming","This trimmer has great battery life. I have used it for over 30 minutes out of the box and have not yet needed to charge it.The built-in adjustable trimmer is a nice feature, but I don't have a beard--I use it to trim my sideburns in between barber visits. However, I noticed that it is a bit difficult to adjust the wheel when my hands are damp. The rubberized wheel is great when your hands area dry, but impossible to adjust when damp.The power switch is also a bit difficult to use with damp hands. they should have added some bumps or ridges to the switch to make turning it on easier.Finally, if you're using this without the trimming guide, the clippers are not flush with each other, so you may not be able to achieve razor-sharp trims.Overall, a well-built trimmer, but it has a few flaws."
5,This is the best,This is the best trimmer by far. I'm actually back on here Amazon to order a new one and thought I'd leave a review for you trimmer-seeking folks. The last one probably lasted me over a year.
1,Dead battery...,"I bought this product a few months (less than 6 months)and I have used it around twice a month. Well, now the battery is dead and since this trimmer doesn't allow to use it while you have it connected to the electricity, it is just useless, a piece of junk!"
4,Solid,"Had the trimmer for about 3 weeks now. Worked easily straight out of the box and has continued to work flawlessly. Big improvement over my previous older trimmer. Probably the biggest thing that stands out is the solid build quality. Has a really nice ""heft"" to it and just feels very solid in every way."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS POS!,"One simple reason why you dont want this pos is the plug to charge it gets put in on the bottom of the base!!! How the heck do you expect us to charge this while its standing up like every other shaver in creation!! i dont want my razor laying on its side like its a beached whale!!! How lame is that!!!! Why didnt they show that on the picture!! I wish I hadnt ripped the box I never expected this plug to go on the bottom, and why dont they make the one with the vacuum catcher on the bottom. This gets hair all over the place. Why discontinue a great product and make this pos. Also the top plastic trimmer adjuster piece is closed in the a cage, I have never seen that before, its weird. The only other razor that sits on the side is called the man groomer but you only use that for body hair once in a blue moon. To have a razor you use weekly sitting on its side is ridiculous. Buy something else or make sure your plug doesnt go on the bottom of anything else you buy."
5,Nice,"I use this to keep my goatee in check and have not had a single problem after about 3 months of use. If you are looking for a cheap razor to get the job done, this is it."
5,Works Well,"Have the beard trimmer for a month or so. Holds charge; comfortable and easy to use; trims beard to desired level and accurately cuts lower edge of mustache. Might be better if the housing and guard were metal, so don't throw it against the wall. Good price."
5,i love this trimmer.,"best trimmer on the market. i have used this model/brand for years, and simply replace it with the exact same thing anytime something happens. this particular version seems to have been slightly updated for durability of it's moving parts, so it just gets better!"
4,Powerful,"Good product, I buy it because I want something fast for my everyday beard mainteinance. Very powerful. Its a little annoying for the sound that became when you turn it on."
2,Buy an extra charger,Like the trimmer a lot - the charger stopped working after one week of use and I had to buy another one.
5,Love The Remington Line,"I've bought three different Remington Beard and Mustache Trimmers to trim my goatee/side burns and the MB-200 continues in the long line of superior and affordably-priced trimmers.The trimmer is quiet, palm-sized, has a long battery life between charges, and does a wonderful job cutting. Recently I tried the Braun Cruze 6, which is twice as expensive, and it paled in comparison. Using the exact same cutting method, it routinely left hair that I had then go back with the Remington and trim. I liked the one I owned so much before buying the MB-200 that when the batteries died, I took it apart, jerry-rigged new rechargeable AA's into it, and used it for another 3-4 yrs.Honestly there really is no comparison with other trimmers and for $20-25 and a 5-10 year expected lifetime, you can't beat the price!!!"
2,Flimsier than it looks,"Bought this a month or two ago. I used it about two times a week, for quick trimming. Unfortunately, it's a lot flimsier than it looks, and the slider bar broke rendering the device useless as anything but an edger. The slider will not hold the guard in place any longer, as the two plastic clips on either side fall to the lowest slot regardless of the position the slider is in. It looks sleek but the components are cheap plastic. You might have better luck, but don't be disappointed if it doesn't last more than a month or two."
4,Really easy to use! And rechargeable.,"Bought this after my last, more expensive beard trimmer bit the dust on an overseas trip (I plugged it in and it didn't have a switching adapter built-in!). I have only used this once (today), but I am as pleased as can be. Works incredibly well and I love the fact that it has a built in battery. Really a terrific bargain."
1,damaged,"I used it for several times, but whenthe battery was off, I couldn't charge it, the indicator was not lightning and the battery was not charging."
1,"battery is dead, now completely useless","I really liked this beard trimmer when I got it, but within a few months the battery started to go dead. Problem is that it does not function while plugged in, so the only way to get it to work is with it being charged up. It won't take enough charge for me to trim my whole beard, which is very very annoying. Stay far away from this product unless you want to replace it within a few months."
1,received free with razor purchace,this product came free(?) with a panasonic razor. does a okay job but does not hold a charge. would not purchase as a single item.
1,Worked well for the first month,"I'm writing this review after using the product for a few months--I'm glad I waited.Overall this product worked fairly well, you can adjust the for the perfect trim of your beard or mustache depending on how long you want it.A few weeks ago I tried to trim my beard. I turn on the trimmer and about 5 seconds later it turns off due to not holding a charge. I've been trying to charge since then, its definitely not a user error; the battery no longer holds a charge. I would not suggest this product to a friend."
4,Good but battery drains fast,Its a good trimmer and is well designed and feels sturdy. The battery does seem to need frequent recharging though. My earlier trimmer would go a lot of days without a charge.But this one somehow manages to remain cleaner with not too much hair getting stuck in the grill and the blades. Thats definitely a plus.
2,Save the box so you can return,Pro: It cuts your hair.Con: Extremely flimsy. You must charge before every use. You cannot even use it if plugged in. It pulls on my hair when cutting.Shop around. I used to get Norelco but couldn't find the same model I had and figured a trimmer is a trimmer....
5,I loved it!!!,I purchased this product years ago and loved it! I thought that I would never be able to find the product again until I looked here. It was wonderful! It was exactly like what I purchased before and was brand new! It arrived fast. It was so easy and wonderful! Thank you!
2,Works Great - Until it Doesnt,"I bought this product over a year ago but only now needed to write a review. It has stopped holding a charge. When it worked it was great. Sharp, easy to use, easy to clean. It help a charge for a while in the beginning but now it wont even hold a charge for a day.I will be contacting Remington to see what they can do. I assume it is out of warranty.The rechargeable trimmer is very convenient, but I guess I will have to find a different company that uses better batteries."
3,"pretty good, but miss mini trimmer","Very good product, however I previously owned 2 similar Remington trimmers that also included a mini, ""pop up"", trimmer for hard to trim areas. This one doesn't have that for some reason. Other than that it's great."
5,good beard trimmer,This product is better than advertised.Easy to use and is better than other higher priced trimmers.
1,Charge function defective,"This trimmer worked perfectly for my beard, except after six weeks it stopped charging. I even tried a different charger, the charge light doesn't light up and it doesn't charge at all.Since it broke down past the 30 day return policy, there's no recourse with their customer service either. No matter how good it is when charged it's just a paperweight now since I can't charge it."
2,"Not my first Remington trimmer, but probably my last","Having used a Remington beard trimmer for 5-7 years prior to purchasing this model, I bought this with confidence that it would produce the same quality results. I couldn't have been more wrong.I have a fairly thick beard and after several months it's become quite apparent that this trimmer is never going to produce an even trim. It doesn't matter what angle or how much pressure I use, it just never gets everything.In addition to the inconsistent trimming, the battery holds very little charge. If I don't plug it in every other use, I'm left with a dead trimmer the next time I need it. That wouldn't be so bad if you could use the trimmer while it was plugged in, but you can't."
1,Short life span,The Remington MB200 had a good start but a short run. It was the perfect beard trimmer but stopped taking a charge after only seven months of moderate use.ADDENDUM: July 2011. I will say that Remington was very cooperative and replaced the product with a brand new one. They do stand behind their warranty.
5,Surprising Durability,"I needed some storage space and thought I would give these a try. I am not disappointed in the least. They are well crafted, very durable inside and out. They have little legs, are lined and are more like furniture than ""baskets"". They live up to the name ""ottoman""."
3,Sweet film,"Juno is a sweet enough film despite the subject matter. However, it is not really cliché as far as films like this go. There is no question about what exactly Juno wants to do with the baby, there is no obnoxious babbling regretful baby daddy or angry pissed off parents. It feels different than all those other films. Ellen Page is perfect for this role. She is barely even acting, its like watching someone in real life. She is what makes this film work. There are sweet tender moments and comedic parts as well. I couldn't help getting a tad teary-eyed at times. As far as all the praise it got during awards season, that was a bit too much in my estimation. It is a cute enough film, just nothing spectacular or terribly unique."
5,Juno - the movie,Juno is the most enjoyable movie we've seen in years. Every character was wonderful and we would recommend this movie to all!
5,Great Movie,"Great Movie. I loved it. not quite the ending I expected, but it was still good. I live these actors"
5,Juno (Blu-Ray),Movie In Perfect Shape. Very Quick Delivery. Will Do Business With This Seller Again. Very Happy.
5,Cute movie,"Bought this with the hamburger phone for our neice for Christmas! She loved it, shipping was quick and product was well packed."
3,"Unbelievable Dialogue, Cool Cast","Sorry folks, but I don't consider this movie to be the kind of work that has reality in play.Yes, Juno is funny and entertaining, but the main character's dialogue is too polished, too witty, and too ""written down"" to make the movie anything near believable.Pregnant teenagers can be witty, just not all the time!I write a teen column for a living; it is almost absurd for anyone to believe Juno offers a sincere look at real life. The issues the young lady has to deal with are SERIOUS, SCARY, and NOT SO POLISHED.Is this a DVD I plan to purchase? Yes. Is this a DVD that I think everyone should own? Absolutely not. This movie is one of the most overrated movies to come out in a while.It's good, bit it ain't THAT good.See ya next review."
2,Not impressed by Juno,"Maybe it was all the hype, all the buildup...but when I finally sat down to watch Juno, I have to say I was decidedly unimpressed. Was I supposed to find a message in the movie? What was this message? I found the acting...OK, the storyline....eh."
4,an excellent kid's view of a very adult experience with consequences,"It was weird to watch this with my daughter, who is just about the age of the girl in this film. What is so wonderful about the film is that it truly gets to the essence of how a child would experience a pregnancy that was a mistake. On the verge of getting an abortion, she decides to have the child and finds a local family for it. Then she goes on with her life, muddling through like so many high school students. It is believable, moving, funny, disturbing, and uplifting, a wonderful stimulus to dialogue between generations. The ending is a little la-di-dah with newfound love, there are perhaps not enough emotional consequences - but that might be the point, when she and her boyfriend do not even want to see the baby - but it is genuinely beautiful in its own way. The acting is absolutely superb, with all the pain and confusion of adolescents dealing (or not) with adult issues.REcommended warmly."
4,A Quirky Nine Month Trip Through Life,"I don't know what I was expecting with this one, but it turns out that it's quite good. It's not really a movie about teen pregnancy - that just forms the backdrop. It's more about Juno's journey through these nine months of her life, how she experiences things, how and what she learns, etc. It's not quite a romantic comedy, but it's definitely not a drama, and it's not something sappy. It's quirky, and overall it's positive and fun. Feel-good but also serious, a little odd, and interesting to watch. No boredom here.Ellen Page does a good job - a cynical, slightly strange teen. Supporting parts by J.K. Simonds, Allison Janney and Jennifer Garner are very well done, good solid perfomances. Jason Bateman's role is a little less well done, but he basically plays a guy who won't grow up, which he does well.I'd give it a good solid 8 (out of 10), and it's something I'd watch again."
4,Interesting and realistic!,"Juno, a 16 year old girl, gets pregnant and offers her baby for adoption. She meets the perfect couple and they all agree that they will raise her child. Eventually the couple breaks up but Juno still gives her baby to the women who was committed from the very beginning to raising this child.Juno then gets into a serious and loving relationship with her baby's biological father, whom is deeply in love with her, and so is she with him.Interesting, sarcastic, and even a bit funny. A realistic film about a phenomenon that has been on the increase.Ellen Page (Juno) is a very talented young address who will sure be a superstar one day."
5,Laughter and tears.,This quirky teen focused comedy/drama has a plethora of witty dialogue and diverse personalities. Very well written story about a young girl trying to do what's best for her and her unborn infant when her spontaneous behavior leads to an unwanted pregnancy. A heartwarming coming-of-age tale that adults will also enjoy.Chrissy K. McVay - Author
5,"Yes, 16 yr olds shouldn't be pregnant....","But you know what sometimes it happens and this movie captures the loving spirit that can be found in ""kid"" who knows she doesn't have all it takes to raise her baby. The premise of the movie may cross moral boundaries but you cannot deny the humor, and antics of Juno. I can watch this movie over and over and never get tired of it, I even love the soundtrack, which I also purchased. Juno has a very EMO sense of humor and speaks way beyond her years sometimes but if you get her you'll get the movie and if not, YOUR A BUM!!! LOL!!"
2,Best Picture? and Best Actress? What a Joke.,"You have got to be kidding me? What a pathetic comment on Hollywood that this movie could be nominated for Best Picture and Best Actress.The movie was as average as it gets. If the DVD had been defective half-way through I would not have cared one iota. The only redeeming quality was Jason Bateman's performance...and the last 20 minutes of the movie which had some poignancy.Ellen Page is nothing but sarcasm until those last 20 minutes. Sarcasm is not a difficult role to play people! Close your eyes and tell me that she does not sound exactly like Jeanine Garofalo. She is a Jeanine Garofalo protege, I'm telling you. Her character is so unbelievable...and not one adult in the entire movie ever tells her to shut her flipping mouth and act respectful? It's just not believable.And to top it all off, the soundtrack has to be the worst in the history of film. I'm embarrassed for Hollywood over these nominations for this picture."
5,Cool Movie,Serious and entertaining. This film has a lot of great dry humor. A smart film that is fun but also delivers a lot of social commentary.
3,Unbelievable and Slightly Over Rated,I thought the dialog in this movie was very contrived. Teenagers do not talk like this. I also thought that the character of Juno portrayed teen pregnancy in a very offhand way and didn't give it the seriousness it deserves. I also thought her character was annoying.
3,Intriguing,"I thought Juno was an interesting film overall. Ellen Page is absolutely magnificent in the central role and Michael Cera fit well the part he plays. Personally, I was a bit skeptical of Juno's essence as a character. She struck me as being partially a male fantasy of what a girl would be like as it's improbable that a high school kid nowadays would have anywhere near the type of musical education she possesses (or walk around with an unlit pipe in her mouth). Page's Juno is highly engaging as a personality and it's hard to take your eyes off of her though. Also, I thought Jennifer Garner and Justin Bateman put in solid backup performances. Juno is entertaining and fun even if its intricacies sometimes make it a challenge to suspend disbelief."
4,3.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:A thoroughly delightful comedy that's smart without being too clever (as its detractors often maintain), very funny, and warm, Juno may not have deserved a Best Picture nomination but it certainly deserves a place in any movie fan's collection."
4,Sweet and funny,"When 16-year old tomboy and wise-cracker Juno (Ellen Page) discovers she's pregnant, she decides to look for a couple to adopt her baby. She finds yuppies Vanessa and Mark (Jennifer Garner, Jason Bateman) and thinks they would be super cool parents.I was prepared to dislike this movie because I don't think teen pregnancy is comical, but I was won over by Ellen Page's quirky charm. She's smart, independent, strong and very likeable, a true gem of an actress. Michael Cera plays her clueless boyfriend; he's believably bewildered by the pregnancy and, though more interested in the track team than the baby, is quite appealing, too.Juno becomes a strong heroine in a tough situation. The movie is funny and the characters are real and it has the off-beat feeling that indie movies often have. Recommended if you can overlook the basic moral issue and enjoy the story."
1,Live rEview,"This could be the worst movie ever.Good production, decent soundtrack, but that's about it.poor acting. screenplay is laughable. and the directing is lame.I'm about halfway through...but maybe this review isn't hitting you like the movie will. It's like the worst flippin hunk o' cheesy-arse junk possible. I'm kinda being forced to watch it. But hopefully this review will save those who are considering it...ah... there might be a sign ... Juno might realize there's something worth more than her spoiled ignorant life...after a little hope, it turned out to disappoint. Lame"
1,Unbearable! I lasted 15 minutes.,"Unbearable! Juno is a smart-alecky little brat. After 15 minutes I stopped the movie, put the dvd back into it's case, and returned it to the library. I would have been really mad if I had bought it. Worst movie ever."
1,don't let teens watch this movie!,I don't think teenagers should watch this movie because the girl tricks her boyfriend into having sex with her and then an un-planned pregancy happens. so i think the movie is saying that it's okay for a teenage girlto trick her boyfriend and get pregnant and it's not. so if you're a parent of teen trying to teach them not to get pregnant or you're a teen:stay way from this movie!
