4,a pretty good comeback,"Over all this is a good comeback CD for Ozzy. The opening song, Gets me through is without question the best song on the CD. It stays true to the classic Ozzy sound whereas the other songs depart from it. Junkie is a great anti-heroin song, Alive is an onkey song with a great chorus but only so-so verses. Running out of time is one of the best songs-a great slow song. However not all is well, the closing song, Can you Hear Them? just plain sucks with terrible melody, beat and a pace that changes constantly-it's not that good to begin with. Despite a few quirks it's a good CD for Ozzy Osbourne fans. If you're new to his music I'd reccomend listening to Ozzman Cometh first to get the feel of the music."
3,I think classic Ozzy is better,"I have been counting down the days until this cd was released. While I'm glad I got it, it left me wanting music more in line with Blizzard of Oz, Bark At The Moon & Diary of a Madman. I find the music in those albums much more enjoyable & listenable then the sometimes too loud and distorted music on this one. There are moments where this one rocks, but for the most part I could pass. While too mellow for some, I found Dreamer the best song on the CD, which really displayed that the Ozz could still sing. I hope the Ozzman still has one more CD in him that can rival the greats of the past."
5,Back with a vengeance!,"I can tell you as a long-time Black Sabbath/Ozzy fan that you will be impressed with the high quality and professionalism of this CD. To me, none of the heavy metal giants can put together lyrics or get the most out of muscians like Ozzy. His lyrics are dark poetry that hold together over time. With musicians like Zakk Wylde back in grand style, this CD is outstanding. The power and ease with which these guys play never ceases to amaze me. Even the ballad ""Dreamer"" conjurs up ""Changes"" from the early Sabbath days. The lyrics are well done and work perfectly.You won't be thinking, ""I've heard this before,"" since Ozzy continues to take this music genre and improve on it. You'll know it's Ozzy and Zakk, AND it's fresh, new, and heavy. This is a very strong effort by the Godfather of Metal."
2,Went For Nothing Years,"First of all; When will be escape from zakk. He is playing slipshod to guitar. In this way, all songs turning to ordinary case for played with husky sound. In fact, I dreamed the album include hit songs and more than taking pains. Only, facing hell and dreamer."
4,"A solid, classic Ozzy album","I was pleasantly surprised when I listenned to this album. I haven't listenned to Ozzy in a few years before this one so it's difficult for me to compare it to his previous albums. I will say that I enjoyed it more than my first listens to No More Tears and Ozzmosis, however.Favorite track: ""Gets me Through"". Everything else I liked except for the ballads."
4,Ozzy rocks,"No, this may not be the greatest Ozzy album, but since when does an Ozzy album need to be his greatest to earn 5 stars? Even if this is the worst Ozzy album, it is still better than 95% of the music released in 2001, and still an album worth listening to."
2,Not a classic album.,I have to admit that I do not like this album. There is nothing outstanding on it. No tracks stand out with either a Riff or rythem you can hum back to. In comparision to some of Ozzy's past albums this isn't a classic.
2,Ozzmosis was better,"Yawn... Very Boring album. I wish he didn't put out this album.From Blizzard of Oz through No More Tears served as masterpieces. Even Ozzmosis had it's moments. But no matter how many times I listened to D.T.E. it just drags.Love the Sabbath and his solo career and many would appreciate his on going performance with Ozzfest, but Down to Earth? I think not."
2,"Stick to your back catalogue, Ozzy!!","DOWN TO EARTH is, at its best, extremely uneven. Just for the paycheck, I guess. Zakk's guitar is not clear.Ozzy astonished me with his silly reality show in MTV. Ok, he was always comercial, but THIS I did not expect..."
4,good music,I saw Ozzy on the Jay Leno show promoting a new cd - so I went to winmx.com and downloaded it -- great music for free -- file sharing rocks
4,Still the best at his own game,"Purely objectively, Ozzy's newest slab of steel would merit only three stars, at least when compared to his best work. Slightly uneven, some songs are even lackluster. BUT, the best songs like the opener ""Gets Me Through"" and ""Black Illusion"" are SO GOOD that they alone are worth the price of admission, and when compared to other recent albums by artists in this genre 4 stars is an understatement... a lackluster Ozzy beats the crap out of most others in their prime...The band is awesome: Zakk Wylde, Robert Trujillo and Mike Bordin are fearsomely good at what they do. Hats off to Ozzy & The Boyz once again."
4,A few good songs but a let down,"Myself being a major fan of ozzy feel quite let down. There was a few tracks that were really good, however overall it seems to me that Ozzy has lost his hardcore edge that he used to have, tracks like ""Facing Hell"", ""Junkie"", ""Black Illusion"" and ""Can You Hear Them"" are my personal favorites off of the album."
4,THE MADMAN IS BACK!!,"The master has returned with a great effort. It's good to have Zack back on guitar. He is the best guitarist Ozzy has had since Randy Rhodes left us. The CD starts out strong with Gets Me Through. You can't help but get into this song. Ozzy then goes on to treat us to a variety of songs, some which bring back memories of Diary and others that are Sabbath like. If you are a true Ozzy fan you will really enjoy this latest release. If you can get the limited edition, there are some great shots of Ozzy with Randy. I believe this is footage from a DVD/Video that was released a few years ago. Bottom line is this: Go buy the CD...only Ozzy can rock like this!!"
2,ratings...,"Why do people rate this album 5 stars?!!? c'mon - this isn't five star material. That is reserved for Blizzard of Oz and Diary of a Madman. Nothing else has achieved that level since.I think some people treat Ozzy like George Lucas. It doesn't matter how mediocre the work, they will rate it 5 stars and use the cliched ""OZZY IS GOD"" arguement.Certainly, Down to Earth isn't 5 star material. It ranks more towards the bottom of his works. SOme of the songs get boring, with generic mediocre riffs. Look for a used copy, but dont pay full price for this."
2,Ozzy is [...],"This album would be one of the worst albums ever ifit wasn't for Zakk Waylde. Ozzy clearly uses studioeffects to cover up his terrible voice. He is justold and tired here and it shows. Dreamer has to beone of the worst songs I've ever heard. Truefullythe only song on here that is worth it is ""Gets MeThrough"" and that is only because(surprise) Zakksplaying like it has been with the rest of thealbums. The funny thing is that I like listeningto Ozzy because of the talent that is around himand not himself.[...]"
3,Ozzy and Zakk aren't really back.,"As a long time Black Sabbath and Ozzy fan I have heard everythingOzzy has ever done.Most of it has been nothing short of brilliantin my opinion.However,this latest effort has me a bit concerned as to where the Ozzman is headed.A previous reviewer was dead onwhen he likened this album to Ozzmosis because it is a mirror image of it.Ozzy must be in some kind of reminiscent ""Beatles"" mode or something because much of the songs,as on Ozzmosis,reak of Beatlesque harmonies and studio sound effects.Aside from ""NoMore Tears"",""No rest for the Wicked"" was the best album Ozzy everput out with Zakk.Go back and listen to the raw power of ""Bloodbath in Paradise"" and ""Miracle Man"" and you will know what I mean.I always buy anything Ozzy puts out because one,I love the guy,and two,I want to see where he is headed.In my opinion a swift u-turn back to ""No more tears"" and ""No Rest"" style of metal""brewtality"" is just what Ozzy should do.I,on the other hand,should take typing lessons!"
2,"Ozzy Returns..Blah, Blah, Blah ,Blah, Blah, Blah...","What is all this ""Ozzy returns"", ""best album since"" nonsense?I have been listening to Ozzy since 1970 and I think this album is demo quality at best. Am I missing something?"
2,Is Ozzy an 80's Band?,"Yes he is and all you have to do is listen to Down to Earth trak 3 ( Dreamer ). This is Phil Collin's "" Against All Odds "". Just in case you don't want to belive this the next track is called "" No Easy Way Out "". This just a big hahahahahha from Ozzy or maybe he has run out of ideas. Who can blame him after all these years :). Anyway, the CD is not bad and the big reason is Zakk Wylde is playing with Ozzy again. The band is very good and this cd shows what they can do ( without Phil C. :) ). I am an Ozzy fan and would recommend that if you are new to his music not to buy this but anything else he has done first. This maybe the last Ozzy recording so you may want it but it lacks much."
5,It's OZZY!!! Love him or hate him...,"These days Ozzy Osbourne is pretty much a household name. You either LOVE the guy and his music... or... you've never heard his music for the past 30+ years but you've heard all the talk and you hate him. C'mon. Grow up. This is THE Godfather of Heavy Metal and he's on another rampage. What else is there to say?This CD brings in some new sounds, it has ZAKK WYLDE as lead guitar again... it has some VERY blood-rooted Black Sabbath vocals/sounds from WAY back. If Ozzy retires for real this time... well, I gotta say... this will be the perfect finale."
3,It's...All right...,"This is a good album, but alot of the songs ""Gets Me Through"", ""Facing Hell"", ""Junkie"" sound Muddy even with Zakk Wylde on guitar it still sounds sluggish. this is not one of Ozzy's good works, if you want to hear ozzy at his best try is 80's through 95' albums"
3,Down to Earth,"I'm a huge Ozzy fan, but Down to Earth just doesn't have alot of appealing songs on it. The album starts out pretty good with ""Gets Me Through"" then about half way through the album you're bored with it.Even the best songs on ""Down to Earth"" do not rank amongest Ozzy's best work. The quality of the songwriting is mediocore at best.If you aren't a big Ozzy fan I would think about it for awhile before I'd purchase ""Down to Earth."""
4,ozzy-ozzy-ozzy,"I'm new to ozzy (and a little bit older than he is !)but I'm hooked - some real great songs on this cd - Gets Me Through, Facing Hell, Junkie, No Easy Way Out.BUT.... ALIVE is awesome ! ! ! what a beat. Randy Castillo would have loved it..."
1,Worthless,Let's face it Ozzy died when Randy died. Nothing he's done in the 20 years can hold a candle to his albums with Randy and early Sabbath. He is all about the money. Money. Money. Money. Shooting MTV shows and getting his daughter on MTV with silly covers. Then trying to relive the past with poor albums like this. No singer is overrated as Ozzy. Avoid.
2,One for the bargain bin..,"This is not one of Ozzy's better solo efforts. In fact, its his worst. Its lifeless and bland. The songs are weak and the production tries too hard to compensate. Who wrote these songs? Sharon? Kelly? Lets hope Ozzy has more creativity left than this clunker would indicate."
1,ya might be pi**ed but true. (SELL OUT),"He is all about the money. Money. Money. Money. Shooting MTV shows and getting his daughter on MTV with silly covers. no one wants to hear it but face it ozzy is a SELL OUT. Just look at OZZFEST a bunch of nu-metal bands that can't play a single note. If you want some real metal pick up pantera, nothingface, machinehead or ozzy's early stuff just don't pick up this garbage cd"
1,Its OVER!,Ozzys gone down BIG TIME! Down to earth is the worst album ever. His voice just gets worse and worse. HE'S CRAZY! He needs to get some sychological help QUICK!
3,People can like him but he betrayed the metal scene,"I dont mind ozzy being known as a great musician, even though his mind is gone now, just watch his show to see for yourself. I give it 3 stars because of the great music and fine musicians. Ozzy is off key the entire time though as he always has been. Dreamer is about the only song ozzy stays in key with, so I will give him that. Even though alot of people who love ozzy, and hate the mallcore nu-metal bs. Then you should know he betrayed what metal is all about just so he can stay commercial. Look at the ozzfest and mtv ect. All of you viewers im sure will put no on my review because I dont think Ozzy is a legend, and he isnt. His music is great, minus the vocals. If he would just stay in key it would be ok, but he doesnt, and its ashame to see how he supports these nu metal bands today, who by far are not metal at all. Still not a bad album, if you like off key vocals, yet great metal this is for you."
2,Perhaps ok by 80s metal standards; near-worthless now,"What we have here is a mish-mash of repetitive, simple, cliched grunge-metal riffs and Ozzy's vocal style. A very stale, boring, and disappointing listen when stacked up to modern metal masterpieces like Opeth's Blackwater Park and Pain of Salvation's Remedy Lane. It's time to pass on the torch, Ozzy."
4,"It's got Ozzy and Zakk, What More Do You Want?","This is a very polished album, no doubt. Some will label that a sell-out or ""overproduced."" I just think it is Ozzy and Zakk taking time to perfect these recordings as much as they can. A lot of good songs here, some hard, one or two that are kind of soft. No, Zakk is not Randy, but he is the next best thing that Ozzy has worked with. Solid album!"
5,Brilliant Peice,This is truely a Brilliant CD. I don't understand the Review the Amazon Editor gave it. (...)From start to finish the CD is great. I rank it among ozzys best. Probably his best post-randy rhoads CD.The godfather has done it again! A+++++
3,For the guy who said Zakk uses a whammy bar,"For your information Zakk plays a Gibson Les Paul! Any one who knows anything about guitars, Les Pauls seldom have whammy bars on them! I have never seen Zakk play a Guitar with a whammy bar on it! This album is a pretty good one conserding how old Ozzy is getting."
3,"Quazzy, i.e. not quite Ozzy","To keep it short and sweet - I'm disappointed. I've been a HUGE Ozzy fan since getting Black Sabbath ""Master of Reality"" in 1971 and have all Ozzy Sabbath albums as well as all his solo CDs. I was jazzed to hear that Zakk's back with the Ozman, and couldn't wait to get ""Down to Earth"" after hearing the track ""Gets Me Through"". There's more introspective lyrics here, and less edgy, hard rocking, head bashing than earlier works. I guess Oz is slowing down with age and prozac. ""Down to Earth"" is just that, and isn't the 1000MPH raw nerve with a few ballad-ish tracks mixed in to keep your heart from exploding.I'm still glad I bought it... but it won't stay in the CD player for a month!"
4,Great album but not his best,"After listening to it more, I changed my mind about the 5 stars part. I admit there is some good songs like Facing Hell and Gets Me Through but there's others where it seems very...not finished in a way. Like they spent more time getting the song actually done then going over the parts. If you wanna hear classic Ozzy, get Blizzard of Ozz, Diary of a Madman or No More Tears."
3,eh...,"There are a few great songs on Down to Earth, but the rest of them just aren't very interesting. It's not the band, they still sound as good as ever. Ozzy's vocals are awesome, as is Zakk's guitar playing, and the rest of the band sound pretty good, but the songs just don't do much for me. Most of them are boring, and while the musicianship is still pretty good, i still feel like something's missing. Overall, this album isn't terrible, but when you compare it to Blizzard or No More Tears, it's just not very good. Highlights Gets Me Through, Dreamer, Junkie nd Running Out of Time."
1,Ozzy is pathetic,"Sharon gathers a group of musicians and a team to create Ozzy's music every time they want to issue out a new cd. The final product is always a hallow, lame, and redundant mess. Considering Ozzy has not made music or lyrics for decades. This cd of course is passionless. Ozzy just sings the words written down for him.Not matter how many people Sharon gathers together. She will never make Ozzy an excellent cd. Why you ask? Because Ozzy doesn't make the music. If it came from Ozzy's heart and soul his solo music would be outstanding.Skip this cd because none of the music is good. Plus Ozzy's voice is terrible. He doesn't even sing in concert anymore. They usually have a recording or a back up singer.Don't be fooled! Don't waste your money on this trash!"
1,Don't Bother...,"I got a chance to test this device rather than buy it and was sadly dissappointed. As slow as video over phone lines can be, this device only comes with a 33.6 modem instead of a standard 56k modem built in. The configuration interface is primitive, using the phone keypad to maneuver through the menu, reminiscent of old DOS programs. The screen can be toggled between pc or camera view. There is no way to open a window on the desktop to show the camera view. And as far as this being advertised as a surveillance camera or baby monitor, the only thing you're going to monitor will have to be in the same room as you because of the length of the monitor cable. I can't imagine paying so much for so little."
5,An Ode to Odie!,"After 20th Century Fox released all five volumes of the Garfield & Friends DVD sets, they decided they wanted to make even more money releasing single DVDS with 15 segments on each.The Episodes on An Ode to Odie are:The Fairy DogmotherDogmother 2Canine ConspiracyOdie the AmazingTruckin' OdieAirborne OdieOdielocks and the Three CatsMoo Cow MuttRobodieRobodie IIArivederci, OdieAll About OdieOde to OdieI only bought the DVD because I am a fan of the series and I wanted the Odie plush."
5,We love Garfield!!,We love Garfield in this house. I used to watch Garfield every saturday morning when I was a kid and now my kids love Garfield as much as I do.
5,best vacuum ever had,"After 3 years, not one problem! Bought at a dedicated vacuum store in Troy, MI. Vacuum bags are not locally available but are easy to buy on internet. Suction is incredible and does not spew dust/debris due to filters. Filters and bags somewhat more expensive but worth it. Very happy Sebo customer."
4,Turning off sounds,"Ok pedometer for its price. The purpose of this review is to explain how to turn off sounds. On the normal display screen (i.e. NOT during setup), you use the up button to turn on/off the Alarm and the down button to turn/off the Music. Repeated pushes cycle thru 2 sound options and OFF."
2,does anyone have the instructions???,"I have enjoyed the VoiceZone talking pedometer, but cannnot shut off the alarm - goes nuts at 0600 for 1/2 hour. To the gentleman whose pedometer ran out after one month: I just changed the battery, and it worked fine again. Pain in the foot, though to not be able to shut either the alarm or the 'walking' music off."
4,Talking Pedometer,"This is a great deal for the price, considering all it does. The sounds and music are fun. You have to be careful with the button settings though; many a time I was freaked out by sudden sounds and alarms eminating from the kitchen, where I keep it!I have only had it for a few weeks so I cannot attest to its durability, but so far so good."
5,Best electric shaver cleaner and lube ever!,"Ok, works great on guns, too, but...this is absolutely the best electric shaver cleaner and lube I have ever used, and I've tried them all. Hose down the foil and the cutters with this stuff, let it dry, and voila...no more oily gunk buildup; clippings do not stick to everything, blow/tap it clean every time. Same review for Hornady One-Shot TAP dry lube, but its a bit more expensive. Lasts a long time on the shaver, so this can should go a LONG way."
5,best cleaning solvent for guns out there!!,"i bought this from cabelas and here on amazon.. this cleaner/gun lube works great. It acts like contact cleaner, i can use rem oil or some other gun cleaner and this stuff takes more grit out. The dry lube is a nice feature to it aswell.. definitely will keep using this stuff for my guns."
3,Needs an update,"Several pages are dedicated to old CRT technology, yet only a few paragraphs for CANbus. Navigation discusses LORAN and dead-reckoning, but GPS is said to have ""a number of problems"" and is portrayed as a future technology. Even the illustrations are hilarious, showing outdated technology such as phonograph players and DIP IC packaging."
2,Shop Teacher,This book is marginal in electronic theory and as a how to trouble shoot and repair information.All subject material is given a broad brush.Not recommened for the automotive gear head.
3,Can't recommend,"When I first purchased this sprayer I was very happy with it. It worked well, and built enough pressure to reach further than I would have believed it would. When finishing spraying I would wash it out with almost a tank of water, then refill the tank and run all of the water through it to clean it as best as possible. When I prepared to spray this spring, the sprayer leaked badly at every possible place. I was very disappointed."
1,worst piece of junk i've ever bought,"my 40 gal, gasoline engine powered sprayer had less than two hours use when the first piece broke, the pressure guage. i replaced it with a liquid filled guage, guage works great now. with less than 24 hours use logged i have replaced the engine, the pump, almost all the fittings, and the bearings in the wheels. I would not recommend buying any FIMCO products."
1,2011 = pile of garbage,"I have used Fimco Sprayers for 10 years. At first they were great, lasted me 2-3 years and I have 10 acres of industrial buildings to take care of (lots of spraying). Then about 5 years ago they only lasted 1 year tops. Until 2011, this year alone We have gone through 4 Sprayers! IFA said it is one of the most returned items. The pump gives out and the pile of garbage leaves you sitting there with 25 gallons of spray and no way to use it.Unless you love driving around to return things and pointlessly wasting your time, don't buy it."
5,"Hot, but very cool: classics from an almost-forgotten genre","This CD is a pleasant surprise from a relatively unknown ensemble (though some of the names are familiar to me). Contains classics such as ""Snag It,"" ""Riverboat Shuffle,"" ""Poor Butterfly,"" and ""A Good Man is Hard to Find,"" the latter two sung with timeless perfection by the lead vocalist (Diane Linscott). Excellent all-around, this cut demonstrates a pure understanding of a classic, yet almost forgotten genre of Jazz. You won't be disappointed!"
5,This Stuff Really Works!,"I was prepared to be disappointed but this product really works. I thoroughly cleaned all the old gunk off my horn, applied the Slide-o-Mix being careful to follow the directions, and things worked pretty well right off the bat. Then over the next few weeks, and after occasionally applying more product, things improved from ""okay"" to GREAT! My slide has never worked this well. And those who say Slide-o-Mix will last a long time are correct."
2,Buy Sakurai Instead,"Townsend says he was ""inspired"" by Sakurai's QM book ""Modern Quantum Mechanics"" in writing this text. Inspired??? It's more like he copied 85% of Sakurai's book including exercises (he barely changed the title too). Since Sakurai's book is good that makes this book not bad but I recommend you buy Sakurai and get it straight from the horse's mouth instead of from this plagorized text."
3,"Decent Book, but missing a lot","Townsend's book gives good insight into Introductory QM, but lacks a lot of the rigor that other books at this level provide. Basically, this book is a gentler version of Sakurai's ""Modern QM"", and it is somewhat annoying that the Townsend implies that Stern-Gerlach experiments are the be-all, end-all way to understand quantum mechanics."
5,A great undergrad text,"I used this text for a course and was impressed with it. For those who claim Sakurai is a better text, I'd say that Sakurai is a text just a half a step above this on in difficulty. I've tried reading Sakurai and found that I only got anything out of it after having studied out of Townsend's book extensively. Sakurai is more on an intro graduate level, while Townsend was written specifically to be an upper-division undergraduate text.In other words, I learned a whole heck of a lot from this book, but don't get Townsend expecting a complete and thorough graduate-level treatment of QM. It's a really good introduction that provides a few dips into more advanced topics (particulary chapter 14)."
4,Soul Ties 2 a Sequel,Very Good! This book confirmed that we should really take time for ourself and to connect with God. ...
5,Soul ties,I thought the book was a great book I felt so bad for Ruth and I hated marie for her betrayal but I think its a winner.I will tell every one i know to buy it.
2,Too few formats,"I was so excited when I first downloaded this book. Its been on my must read list for quite a while. However, it does not work on any of the Kindle products that I have, except for the cloud reader on my iphone. I have a Kindle keyboard and it doesn't work on that. I have the cloud reader on my computer (windows 8) and it doesn't work on that. I can't read on my phone because the text is waaaayyyyyy too small and gives me a headache. I am so disappointed. It seems as though I am going to have to less amazon Kindle books purchasing and take advantage of my local library."
2,Not really an ebook =(,"The entire book is made up of pictures. I mean, every single page is a picture, so none of the nice features of Kindle, like word lookup, will work. I understand that this book has a singular layout because of the drawings by the author, and that's likely the reason they turned the book into a set of pictures. But I think is dishonest not to stablish it clearly on the product description. I think is deceiving. Have I known this beforehand, I would have never bought this particular edition."
2,"Beautiful edition, bad translation.","This is a beautifull presented book, but this translation is NOT good. Get the translation by Cathy Woods. It captures much more of the poetry and quaintness that Richard Howard has seen fit to tear from St Exupery's exquisite writing."
2,I DIDN'T READ IT (in English),"I read this book in German (Der Kleine Prinz), I liked it and thought I should order the English for a friend. The Little Prince went there ... but I don't know what my friend thought about. All I know is: Language is culture, e.g. a book originally written in French, later translated to German and also to English (British or US-English?) may or don't make the same ""good"" impression any reader. So I'm not able to create a review for The Little Prince."
4,I like it,It's a short book that has much deeper meaning than one might think. I read it in an hour and enjoyed it a lot.
5,Great book!,Its worth reading a few times! Make sure you get the Katherine Woods translation. The new translation is not as good.
5,Fit for a Princess,"I purchased this as a gift for my 7-year-old niece, who lives in a city distant from me. I'm told by her, and her parents, that it is a beautiful edition.I can add nothing to the comments about this wonderful story, which speaks to the hearts of both children and adults.So far as I know, it was a hit with my niece and her parents."
5,The great little prince,This is one of the most wonderful books I have ever read. It is full of imagination and shows a different way to see things. It is a masterpiece. No wonder why the French celebrate this author as one of their greatest.
3,Is it in PDF?,"Finally! The Little Prince on Kindle with color illustrations. HOWEVER, I am unable to enlarge the print, which makes for a lot of squinting while I re-read this classic piece of literature. I hope that eventually, Amazon will get it together and make this book more ""reader-friendly""."
1,"Hey, Amazon!","Dear Amazon.com,No one is ever going to buy one of these without at least SOME information. Furthermore, please learn the difference between a transit and a builder's level for the sake of searching out one or the other."
5,Perfect lullaby CD,I bought this CD for naptime at my job. The children love the CD and it is nice to have lullaby songs with words as well as instrumental. I love these classic Disney songs!
2,not the songs from the movies,"I was disappointed that these songs were not the original recordings from the Disney movies. They are sung by other artists. On the other hand, they are still good songs and there are 20 tracks on the CD, so it's worth keeping. I'm sure the baby won't miss those familiar voices that mommy was so looking forward to."
2,bad singers,I like the songs okay but the singers are awful. There is a lady that always wakes up my baby when she tries to hit high notes. Unfortunately it seems that she sings every other song on the CD. I've deleted her song off of my itunes. I'm going to stick to instrumental lullaby cds.
3,An ok Night time cd,I had this a long time ago when my now 5 yr old was an infant. I LOVED it then....not so much now. U can find alot of these songs by different artists on iTUnes
1,"boooooring, bad voices","Most of the songs are boring and I cringe when some of the singers try to hit high notes. I love some of my daughter's cds. There are others that don't interest me, but I don't mind them. This one is grating. Luckily, my 2 year old isn't too thrilled with it either and just asks me to play the first song (when you wish upon a star) over and over. I'm going to have to find that song on another album with a better singer. I'd recommend not wasting your money on this cd. For a wonderful, soothing lullaby album, I'd recommend ""World Sings Goodnight"". It's absolutely beautiful."
5,Cherished music you'll listen to for years. A Must Have CD.,I bought the this cassette 9 years ago for my daughter. I'm still listening to it - after going through two copies of the cassettes and I've now advanced to the CD. Every time I listen to this CD it brings me back to when my daughter was 1 and the special bonding times I've had with her. I buy it for all of my friends or family that have babies. (I have to admit that I take it to work and listen to it on my headphones - very soothing).
3,Mostly Good,"There are a few songs that creep me and my daughter out, but for the most part she loves the CD"
5,Perfect Lullaby Music,"My children have been listening to this music for 16 years, since my oldest was born. The original was on cassette and was getting very old. My girls insisted on replacing it. They still go to bed every night listening to it, and now they put it on continuous play. It is very relaxing and enjoyable to listen to. Great bedtime music for any age."
4,Share it with your baby,My baby has been listening to this CD for almost 7 months now. It's a lifesaver. This CD soothes him during the long commute.
1,Cheesy,I bought this CD because of all of the favorable reviews but was very disapointed. All of it is quite cheesy which is what I feared a Disney lullaby CD would be like. I immediately gave it away. My personal lullaby favorites are Brazilian Lullaby and Classical Baby: Mozart-Sleepy Time.
5,Soothing collection for kids,"My wife and I played this CD every night - for 2 years straight. My 3 year old son, Vincent, hums and sings along with all the songs. I can't imagine life without this soothing collection of gems."
4,Great for rocking a baby to sleep,Great CD for rocking your little one to sleep. It has all the lullaby songs I've always heard but can never remember the words to.
5,cried my eyes out,"I listened to this tape when I was 9 and still have it. I now have a nephew and found this on CD and heard these songs for the first time in 20 years - cried my eyes out. I remember falling asleep imagining all of the things sung about in these songs. Naturally, the music is god awful, but SO fantastic for kids. Can't wait to rock my 'phewy to sleep listening to these songs. le sigh...."
2,very disney...,"A few good songs, but mostly a little theatrical with the Disney sound. I was looking for something I could sing along with to my baby, but I'm not this good..."
2,Ballads with unorginal artists performing.,I was dissappointed to find that this CD contained many popular songs sung by non original artists. The accompanyment on many selections was simple and un impressive.
1,Black end table,This table was very cheaply made. I have been satisfied in the past with the items that I have ordered from you. I will definitely not order any furniture in the future. The only reason we kept it was because it would have been difficult to return.Iwas very disappointed.
5,I loved it,"I just saw ""The Helio Sequence"" the other day in a record store in downtown Portland, and I was completely blown away. I feel so lucky that I'm from Portland, in the way that I can just drive a few minutes to hear some great music instead of waiting for that certain band to go on tour and hoping they come to my town.The music on this CD is well-balanced, with the perfect mix of complex melodies and...well, it just makes you feel good.I wouldn't be surprised if this twosome became very famous someday. They deserve it, if that's what they want."
3,"Hand paintings, do not deliver","The book is generaly nice. I had no idea that the shoes are painted not photographed.Although it is more artistic, some of the beauty of the more modern shoes is lost."
2,Why Bother it's A Bother,"The device is unreliable, I have purchased three in two weeks. It's hard to talk into and must the time you have to hold the microphone right next to your mouth for the other person to hear you. I would get the one that cost a little over a hundred dollars."
3,early live tv,"Some stories are fine-some pretty bad even some later used by Rod Serling on the Twilight Zone like ""What you Need"". Funny/sad watching an alcoholic Lon Chaney thinking this is a rehearsal take as the cameras roll LIVE and the mad Frankenstein monster gently puts down the chair he was to throw and destroy when the take went LIVE."
3,Entertaining but can be boring sometimes,"This book can be very entertaining at times. However, I found myself falling asleep at certain times while reading this book."
1,A bunch of planted 5 star reviews don't make a book good,The glowing reviews which have obviously been planted here by the authors are akin to movie studios that invent quotes from fictional film critics to hype bad movies.This book is shallow tripe.
4,"6 Pros, 3 Cons","Pros:1. Lightweight and sleek (fits in the smallest aisles).2. Forward & Rear facing.3. Bassinet style is unique and very comfortable cushions.4. For the ""simpler"" parent - like having a DELUXE umbrella stroller! Not for the parent who likes to take the nursery room with them when they go out.5. Great storage, trays, etc...small bottom basket but I don't like to take alot with me so it's a plus for me. Less is ""more"" when I go out.6. Stylish and great colors.Cons:1. Tricky to open at times2. Hard to turn sharp corners3. Wish it folded up smaller."
3,Has some driver problems,"Since installing this board, I have had a number of abends due to driver problems which appea to stem from the driver used. I don't know if it is a problem with compatibility between MS's std driver and the board or what. Driver problems are very hard to debug. When the board works, it does work well and was easily installed."
5,Durable and Affordable,"I bought these Diagonal Cutting Pliers as sort of a disposable tool, I didn't want to spend 4 times the price for a nice pair and end up breaking them, but much to my surprise They've held up quite good. I bought these at a hardware store so I had the luxury of buying a pair that had the cutting edges line up perfectly, but about 1/3 of them didn't seem to be, so if you order these online you might get a lemon. The grip is nice and thick so you don't drop them easily. The molding of the rubber grips is tight and doesn't seem cheap. The pliers are weighty and seem decently polished, and I would say that for the price they are well worth it."
2,Great music cheap content,For the price that their asking 17.99 the content is cheap because it is only an hour and 10 mins of music and that includes extras. The manufactors should have made each of the bands sets longer by giving each band 5 to 7 songs and given korn 10 songs. That would have made it worth the price.
4,Great scope for 22Lr,I couldnt have paid any more money for this type of scope and gotten a better deal. I love in on all 22LR rifle.
2,Defective......,".........but great customer service from The Sportsman's Guide. They emailed me a prepaid FedEx label to return it, which I am doing today. Good optics on the 'scope, but I could NOT adjust the bullet's point of impact up or down. I have mounted many 'scopes on rifles and sighted them in (as I have now done with the replacement I secured for this 'scope), so I had to conclude it was the 'scope and NOT the operator."
4,Great scope,BSA took their time out to make a scope with Bullet drop compensator and not only that provide 3 turrets for different grain. The image is sharp and clear for a .22 and the distance. The turrets clicks into place nice and firm. For the price its hard to beat !
2,Broken Windage Adjustment,"The scope is quite nice for the money, however the left to right windage adjustment is broken on the one I received. When I try to sight it in and turn the knob nothing happens at all, the bullet continues to hit the same spot as before. I have requested a replacement and will be waiting to see how the seller handles this return. I will update my review once this is resolved."
1,Junk,Looks nice But the Cross hairs are lose in the scope. BSA customer service is lacking. I would not put this scope on a sling shot.
5,"BSA""sweet"" .22 scope","This is a great product, I would recommend this to anyone. Hard to beat the quality for the price. Will buy more in the future."
5,Worth every dollar,"great scope for the money.excellent clarity,and the bdc turret is spot on!after zeroing at 50 yards,bullet impact was extremly accurate all the way out to175 yards.just click the turret to your target range.the extra turrets are perfect for differing grain bullets!this scope works.."
1,Worthless,"This scope is worthless. Do yourself a favor and go down to the local supermarket, buy a roll of paper towels and and use the cardboard core. It will be MUCH more accurate then this scope.The scope I got was off by almost 18 inches at only 25 yards. The windage adjustment appear to be just for looks. I tried adjusting a few clicks and got nothing. A few more clicks and still nothing. 100 plus clicks later (which should be at least several inches) and still no change. To top it off, BSA wants me to pay to ship it to them and then pay them another $10 on top of that to have them fix and ship back a scope that should have never left the factory in the first place. Seriously, how does a scope pass QA when the windage adjustment doesn't even work?"
2,Failed,I loved this scope once sighted in. Then after about another 20 pellets from my crosman phantom air gun the crosshairs rotated counter clockwise. I could not recommend this scope for use on air guns.
3,Can't Get it right...but its okay,"I bought this scope because of the reviews I've read...Got the scope hooked it up and went out to shoot my...Ruger 10/20 Carbine...Without the scope I can get my 8"" steel target at 25yrd.With the scope I cant even see where the bullets are going...Went out and bought me a Center Point Laser Boresighter...Put that on and lined up the crosshairs with the red dot, took it out fired and the scope was still offall of this at 25yrd... maybe it just me not knowing what im doing but the instructions don't help at all..."
1,I sad,Right door was broken. It is not opened. I can't return toy because it is new year gift. It is look good but when I was trying to open the door it drop off.
1,Dull and hateful,"Hatefulness is always interesting to those who peddle in it, but rarely to other people. You'd have to feel a personal stake in the outdated conservative politics Podhoretz emblematizes or be deeply curious about a group of New York intellectuals who believed they were the center of the known universe in the Fifties, but who have hardly left a cultural legacy as important as (say) Bloomsbury or the Paris Lost Generation. Who the hell cares about the Trillings anymore, or about Lillian Hellman? The end result is the voice of a sad, petty little man recounting both his delight in his cruelties to a group of minor intellectuals he betrayed and his sense of loss at having alienated them from him forever."
1,the neighborhood solution,"The only remedy for a book like this is mild violence. Norman Podhoretz could use a firm punch in the mouth. Perhaps the loss of a few teeth would render him unable to pick flesh from the bones of the dead, as he does in his trashy book."
2,This is amusing garbage...,"Podhoretz is a rigid ideologue who, like alot of former Communists, puts the party line before friendship. The book tells the story of the termination of friendships with all kinds of interesting people. I wonder why they were friends with him in the first place. He is a paranoid little bigot but he writes nicely. Get it out of the library."
1,trash,I found this book in a box of books someone put out for the trashman. I picked it up because I saw Ginsburg's name in the title though I had never heard of the author. The same day I put it back where I found it.
3,Grandpa's house,"it was my favorite book as a child and I must have worn out 5 of them, rubbing off all the fuzz."
2,Not that great.,"I bought a new iron because the one I had was dying. I picked the Black and Decker because of all it offered. When I tried to iron some blouses that I always ironed with my old one, I could not get the wrinkles out. It was very frustrating. On top of that it leaked out the bottom. I took out my old iron and finished the job."
1,Please dont buy it,"I bought Black and Decker because of its reputation believing that maybe it cost so much because it is a good iron. Well think again, not only does it drip on your clothes but you cant fill up the water tank all the way or the water will spill in huge circles on your clothes. Then it does not get the wrinkles out unless you put water in it and it still doesn't do a great job then. I was VERY unhappy with this iron and wouldnt recommend it to anyone. When it dies it starts to smell really bad and does not move across clothing easily. When it quit it brown water started to bubble out the machine. I was not surprised because it wasnt good to begin with."
1,"LOOKS GOOD, IF ONLY IT WORKED","THIS IRON DOES NOT GET HOT AND IT LEAKS ALOT. I LIKE THE FACT THAT THE CORD WINDS UP, BUT THAT IS THE ONLY THING THAT WORKS ON THE IRON"
2,People can't hear me!,"Even though I'm able to hear whoever is on the phone just fine, the person I'm calling can't hear a word that I'm saying because the microphone isn't close to my mouth AT ALL. But then again, it's always safer to have this accessory than driving with a hand-held phone!"
1,Very disappointing,"When I received this as a gift, I thought this would really be boon since I spend a great deal of time discussing business with my clients and need to be able to use my keyboard at the same time. Due to static, connection problems(to the phone itself) and uncomfortableness, within 30 days the thing had become useless."
2,Not the best piece....,"Although it is a good headset, I found that mine was tearing at the bottom of the plug....several wires were stripped to bare copper. I had to splice the wires myself. Besides that it was more less comfortable (ear piece) but awkward when phone is on my belt."
1,Very disappointed,"This ear piece for the Nokia is an awful product, it very lowquilty. The speaker piece is all the way near the ear piece, two in one. I recommend [higher end products] then this one, I'm willing to pay for them..."
5,For Kids & You,I had this on cassette for my 24 yr old and had more fun playing it on the way to school every morning. Found it again on cd and bought it for my grandchildren. Set to oldies with Disney characters singing is so much fun.
5,Loved this album!,"I loved this album as a kid! I wish it was re-released on CD. My favorite songs were Mickey Motion, Mickey and Minnie On a Moonlit Night, and the title track."
1,Unhappy,I have not received my order as of yet although you have charged my Credit Card.Hard to review something you don't have.I wanted to give this product NO STARS but your survey won't accept it.
3,Dog blanket missing,"I really like the tent but when I reviewed this item online with other vendors, it showed a blanket to go inside. When the dog tents came, the instructions tell you to put the blanket inside. WHERE IS THE BLANKET? I think they offer this price because it is incomplete. I would not order from Amazon and find another vendor that sells the whole product. Customer service apologized but does not help with how misleading this product is."
2,Didn't get all that was offered!,Instent Dog Haus Pet TentIN the advertisment it states that it comes with a pad for the inside I did not get this with my order and have been able to get an answer from the company about this.the tent is good and easily unfolds and folds up and can be returned the the bag provided and will hold two big dogs
1,Be Careful!,"I ordered the ABO Gear Dog Haus Pet Shelter from Wicked Deals for a sick pet, and paid for expedited service. It was indicated that the product would arrive between January 21 and 28th. Nine days later, I received a notice from Amazon that they had not had a confirmation of delivery from Wicked Deals. I forwarded two emails to Wicked Deals asking about the status of this purchase. Not only did I not receive the item, Wicked Deals never even responded to my inquires! And this is ""expedited"" service from Wicked Deals, who claims to be all about customer service?!....Be Careful when dealing with Wicked Deals! (It isn't one if it never arrives....)"
4,great tent,"got this for our dog who goes to agility trials.it's easy to put up and take downand is light weight for carrying.tossing a blanket or bed in there makes it lessslippery for dog - she got comfortable in it pretty quickly.personally, i would not leave a dog unattended in it, butit's great for what we wanted....."
4,Dog Haus pup tent,"I found this product to be of good quality and, in fact, most of my fellow agility club memebers use them at trials. One thing I will point out, however, is the flooring for the tent was not included. I have substituted an indoor/outdoor remnant and that is fine, but I would have liked to know more clearly that this component was not included in the price. The price, however, I found to be the lowest I saw."
4,terrific buy,was looking for an alternative to heavy crates for agility competitions. hated lugging 2 metal folding crates. love this idea. my 2 dogs fit in it very comfortably(50 lbs and 35 lbs). took it to the beach as a shade shelter and they loved it. popped up and folded as easily as advertised. not for dogs who dig in crates or who don't sit happily in crates as it will probably tip over with enough pressure.
3,LUCY GOES WEST.,"Jagger stars as an evil Indian agent stationed in the Arizona Territory who bilks the redskins for all they're worth. Craig plays the handsome government agent sent to clean house by posing as a renegade Indian scout in order to get the goods on Jagger. While playing cat-and-mouse, both men romance Christine Larson (Ball), the lovely restaurant owner whom Craig eventually wins over...This fair 1942 western was initially promoted via advertisements as a massive outdoor epic on a par with 1930's CIMARRON upon release & unfortunately, the resulting product was just another mediocre and at times frankly dull Western which will appeal mostly as a curiousity for fans of Lucille Ball. Decent cameo performances by Billy Gilbert as the Justice of the Peace and Tom Tyler as Geronimo himself help keep the film somewhat interesting, however. Colour photography would have been an advantage here."
2,very basic and overpriced,"As I recall, this was a giveaway item in 1975- a promo for Vivitar. It's not actually a book; it's a pamphlet. The information inside is good, but it's fairly basic, and for the current asking price you can buy a real book with useful information about flash photography (this has 20 pages of actual information / examples). Only a true collector of obscure photographic ephemera would be interested in this."
3,A memoir from the front lines of F1 safety and medicine,"A fitting testament to Professor Watkins' work in Formula One -- in which he waged a long battle to improve circuit safety and medical care facilities for drivers -- this memoir is filled with both poignant and joyful moments. It starts with the weekend of the San Marino GP in May 1994, where Watkins was told by Ayrton Senna, ""Sid, there are certain things over which we have no control. I cannot quit, I have to go on."" Covering the deaths of Senna, Gilles Villeneuve, Ronnie Peterson and others by the man who was first on the scene of their accidents, one might expect this to be a maudlin tale of lost glory. But Sid Watkins is not that type of person, and neither is his book."
5,Destined to become a classic in motorsport literature.,"Professor Watkins provides his insights into the personalities and events of formula one racing based on over two decades involvement with the sport. He has completed more circuit laps in medical vehicles than some drivers are able to accomplish in their F1 career. His humor, dedication to the sport, and commitment to improving safety standards are reflected in this well written book that should appeal to everyone interested in the human aspect of the F1 circus."
5,Rhino gun mount,Great product. It went right in my Rhino with no problems. It was easy to bolt in and very easy to adjust to fit just right.
2,sore,its okay not realy work buying unless you are a massage therapist i am a fake one for my family.
1,Argumentative and illogical,"If you're looking for a good book on the Holy Spirit, I recommend Lester Summral's The gift and ministries of the Holy Spirit or Experiencing the Spirit by Robert Hiedler. Stott's book is argumentative and frustrating. He starts the book by saying that you can't take experiences in the Bible the same as historical facts in the Bible. I thought the Bible was ALL based on man's experiences with God? How is Acts different than Exodus? I believe that God has so much more for us out there. Francis Chan also has a great book on the Holy Spirit called Forgotten God."
4,A really charming little film,This is a character driven film that relies on the excellent performances of its diverse cast. Chisu Ryu is an absolute marvel to behold. No matter what adversities come his way he always manages to keep a sly half grin on his face as if to show that he is unbreakable despite the problems that he encounters. This is character acting at his very finest and all the characters are wonderful.
4,Great series! Just sad it ended before she picked the guy!,"The product was very good. I had no problems with it and I received it very quickly, even though it was only a week or two before Christmas. The series is good...it gets a little cheesy towards the end, and unfortunately they cut the series before there is any real conclusion to the story. But overall I give it a thumbs up!"
5,Reliving History,I found this DVD to be wonderful. I have always loved the Christy series and missed it. Kellie Martin was the quintessential Christy Huddleston. You can't watch these episodes without involving your whole heart. Enjoy a piece of history and purchase these videos. I went out and purchased the novel very soon afterward and enjoyed that too!
5,excellent quality,"I just wanted to say that the video quality is excellent and the sound volume is well balanced with this set. (I hate those series where the music is too high and voices too low, making you constantly adjust the volume.) I too am happy ""Christy"" finally has come out and devoured the set in a just a couple days."
5,What A Great Way To Begin The New Year,"I am thrilled that Christy is going to be on DVD. For those who loved the book, the series became a continuing legacy to Catherine Marshall's beloved mother Leonora Wood. How fortunate we are to have had the opportunity to watch a series that touched our heart for 21 episodes and has been off the air for almost 15 years. This is truly a television show that will remain close to our hearts for many years to come. I applaud the extraordinary actors who came into our home each week and gave us a glimpse into television at it finest.Donna Klopfer Endicott, NY"
5,Wonderful!!!,"In 1994 every member of my family watched this wonderful program every Wednesday evening that it was on. Since the birth of DVDs I've looked almost every week to see if it had come out. Finally it did. I ordered it right away and as soon as it arrived, again every member of my family (now 13 years older) sat down and we watched the entire season and a half in 3 evenings. We enjoyed it just as much, if not more. It's a great story. The only thing better is the book it is based on: ""Christy"" by Catherine Marshall. It is a great movie and book for young and old. If you haven't seen the series or haven't seen it in a while, do it, you won't regret it. And if you've never read the book, read it. It's a book for all ages. I think a young person from 12 to 112 would enjoy it. I read it when I was in my 30's and thoroghly enjoyed it. Probably the best novel I've ever read."
3,Sweet 90s show,Watched and loved when I was younger and hadn't seen since. Was quite a shock in how different it was from my memory of it. But a sweet show. The DVD arrived in a timely manner and the deal that I got on it was really cool.
4,Christy - The Complete Series,"Excellent videos and we are enjoying the Christy episodes. Only problem is that the disks are not marked in any way, so one must find out by trial and error which is side A and which is side B for each disk and then label them accordingly."
3,"Great movie, poor DVD quality","This was a great series from the 90's...but the DVD quality is very poor. They are ""flippers"" which means you have to manually flip the CD to play the ""side 2"". I guess it's a cheap way to produce movies. The 4th dvd skips and won't play from the very first time I ever played it. Very disappointing quality for a $30 set."
5,Christy-The Complete Series,"I have watched the pilot and one of the series and I just love them. They tell a story of a determined young woman, wanting to contribute something to society. She goes to the Tennessee Hills, as a school teacher. Life is hard, very hard, but she falls in love with the children and begins to bring hope to these people who have so little. Very good, a great family DVD."
5,Christy is Fantastic Family Entertainment!,"The series takes place in Tennessee about the turn of the twentieth century and Christy has been hired as a teacher in a rural mountain community. She is excited about her first job and takes off on her journey there. As things go everything seems to get harder and harder the further she goes. Great insight into that area and how it probably hasn't changed much since then.Of course, she encounters resistance and rebellion from the kids and parents but finally wins them over. She must learn to understand the ways of these people and how to teach them what she wants them to learn.It only continues to get better and better with each program. Sort of reminds me of a missionaries trip into some wild place that is 3rd world in nature but is willing to learn and grow and develop into current times.Well done, excellent writing and get stories about love, life and relationships."
1,Very disapointed,"This is not a good series to watch, especially with children since Christy, the focal person in this story finds herself attracted to a married man! How can that be God-glorifying? What are we teaching the children with regards to commitment in marriage? The bible is clear, what God has put together, let no man put asunder.I have watched the complete seasons and I admit that there are a lot of good things to learn. It made me cry and it made me laugh. But at the end, I could not believe that a Christian woman like Christy was torn between a God fearing single man to a married, atheist!Not only that, but it has profanity and blasphemy.It is a sad day when Christians would forget the Word of God for the sake of of entertainment. I doubt if the author of Christy would be very happy with this TV series' depiction of her book."
3,Order Not Received Promply Dealt With,"I ordered ""Christy"" and ""Middlemarch"" on May 2nd, expecting them for Mother's Day, but they never arrived. My daughter finally emailed someone about this and another order was made on May 20th. We received them in about four days. WOW! The first order has never come. Today is June 7th. I thank whomever sent the second order. cfkendell"
4,Christy,The DVD of Christy was good but I liked the way the book ended. I wasdisappointed that the DVD did not follow the book closer. But it was stillgood so I have passed it along to my friend to see and enjoy.
4,Great!,"I love this series! It is a wonderful Christian series that I can safely enjoy with the family. I would have rated this 5 stars if the DVDs weren't written on front and back. I fear they wont last as long and will get easily damaged. Other than that, the shows are great and I highly recommend them!"
5,as good as the original series... without the commercials!,"Christy - The Complete Seriesit is wonderful to experience this series again after so long without it on tv. the quality of the production is faultless. and amazon's service on this product was excellent, as usual."
5,Christy is wonderful,This Series is a wonderful step back into another culture and another time. I loved this seeries when it first came out and I can still sit for it over and over again
2,WHY CHANGE A PERFECT STORY ?,"First, I do really like the Christy DVDs, don't get me wrong. They are lovely, and has some marvelous acting by several characters, and in themselves they are a good story.....BUT...well, they are a far, far call from the original story by Catherine Marshall. So many of the plots are so far fetched as to be a little ridiculous- such as the doctors dead wife returning.Also, the hardship Christy underwent is not really apparent.Just my 2cents worth...."
5,First Rate,"This video is an excellent source of information for anyone who wants to know what life was really like back on the 18th-century frontier. The acting is earnest and not too theatrical. The scenery is harsh, yet breathtakingly beautiful. The soundtrack, featuring the Word of Mouth Chorus, got me totally hooked on shapenote singing. The blending of the singing and the New England scenery is extremely moving. I do hope that they come out with a DVD edition of this film. Although firmly based on the wonderful book by the same name, this film stands on its own as a documentary of colonial life. I own many books, films and CDs concerning colonial history and this film is a real gem. I prefer to collect DVDs these days instead of VHS tapes, but I made an exception for this film - it is worth it."
4,nice geneology work,"If you're interested in keeping files of your geneology/lineage, this would be a documentry/movie for you. They made a movie out of diaries and other information and saw how someones life could have been like back in that time. I find it interesting."
5,Hearts Afire 2nd Season,Received in excellent codition and are thoroughtly enjoying the episodes. Each episode is refreshing. The author is especially talented. Will order more seasons in the future.
3,Early Rollin Vampires,"Rollin's second vampire film is an example of technique over plot. Not up to par with some of his other work, it remains a must see for some of the startling images that occur within its running time. I originally saw this film in a heavily edited washed out print, Redemption has triumphed once again with a nice looking transfer. A perfect segue to his much better 'SHIVER OF THE VAMPIRES'."
2,The usual Rollin problems...,"...which are: The subject matter would usually lend for a visual feast. However Jean Rollin manages to be an ultimate bore when it comes down to the cinematography in this production. When we all know from ""Rape of the Vampire"" and ""Fascination"" that compelling visuals can be his strength. The lighting is flat, compositions plain.The editing is sloooooow. Do we really need to see a guy walk across a field until he disappears into the horizon? In an end sequence maybe, however not in the middle of a story that already tends to induce sleep.My favorite: the girl that shoots herself in front of an audience. No gun smoke, no jerky body movement, no blood.The acting is as usual questionable however this is most likely not a priority when watching a Rollin film. The majority of costumes look homemade. Or completely pretentious.Bummer."
5,Rollin rave.,"Glad I got this. I am a huge Rollin fan and loved this release. Came swiftly and undamaged and the price was right as well. Highly satisfied with this purchase,"
2,The Nude Vampire,"Months later, I forgot what I have seen in details. Nude scenes? Can't remember. Vampire? Yes, bounding around.Story? Can't remember. All in all, I am in no position to write a down-to-earth review. The truth being not memorableto me means it is not my favorite."
5,GO MICKEY!,"In 2nd grade, this is how I fell in love with hip hop. Great, fun, and energetic music for the kiddies!"
4,OLD FAVORITE,"I first saw this movie when I was much younger, but I have always wanted a copy of it of my own. I love this couple together."
4,IT WAS OKAY.,"The beginning was kind of boring, but as it dragged on it got a little interesting. Let's just put it this way, the movie climaxes then tires out. But the fact that it was released in 1973, it had done good addressing the interracial bond between the mother, Marsha Mason and her son, Kirk Calloway. When James Caan, the navy officer stepped in and took on the role of fatherhood, because the mother decided she couldn't take it anymore and bolted out of the relationship; it was a little strange but touching. All in all, it was a good movie."
4,cinderella liberty,"Very good movie, probably James Caan's best role other than Sonny Corleone. Oscar nominated Marsha Mason is perfect! Good songs by Randy Newman. A litle dated in spots, but worht it for Mason alone!"
4,Enjoyable,"I haven't read a lot of DeLint's work, but this and his other two collections of short stories I found to be enchanting. I espically like that you find the same charachters in several of the stories, but from different perspectives so you really get to know the charachters. It's realistic in the way that people interact with thier circles of friends and the magical element is refreshing and makes you open your eyes to the world around you.......you may find yourself looking for the faries in the park without realising it after reading this book."
5,Soft!,This penguin is very soft! The baby is so cute. I am very happy with the quality!I would recommend.
2,Disappointed,"We purchased this to go along with a team building activity related to the book ""Our Iceberg is Melting."" We had purchased similar items for prior events, but I was disappointed in the quality of this one."
4,My daughter loved it!,I bought this for my daughter's birthday. She collects penguins. This is a much loved addition to her collection. She named the mom Susan and the baby Max.
2,Weird red felt on beak,"The penguin is cute, but there's a weird red felt in beak, as if the penguin was biting something. I don't know if I got a faulty one or if all of them are like this. Real penguins have an orange-red color in the lower beak, but there's nothing like the piece of red felt in between them. It's confusing."
5,It's mine....back away.,Decided to keep this for myself. Too cute for the dog to accidentally get hold of or my grand-kids making it dive in the bathtub. It sits in my home office underneath the penguin wall decals that I purchased on Amazon too. Go look at them.....they are great too.
4,Communication Law in America,"The book was a great value, delivered on time, and in the condition that was exepcted."
2,good product,"I purchased this ""pillow"" for my husband. He sleeps with a regular pillow between his knees. I thought he would really take to this for the comfort, but I think he slept with it only once. It lays by his side of the bed and I'm thinking of selling it. The product is great. It's everything it claims to be; unfortunately, my husband didn't seem to care for it."
5,Immensly useful guide,A superbly written guide for students and historians on a little covered subject. Highly reccomended for anyone that has an interest in the more obscure Wehrmacht subjects. RFM
4,Great CD,"McGraw is a great performer. Good songs.The only song on this CD that is hard to listen to, is ""Suspicions"". In my opinion, Eddie Rabbit will always ""own"" this song with his original recording in the 1970's."
4,let it go,"Tim McGraw's ""Let It Go"" is easy to appreciate if you're a fan of his previous work. His vocals are as sharp as ever, and the production is great. So far, I feel nothing stands out in this collection like his previous ""Just To See You Smile"" or ""One Of These Days"" or last album's ""Blank Sheet Of Paper"", but all in all this is still a nice album.Highlights for this listener; The duet with wife Faith Hill ""Shotgun Rider"" and the title cut ""Let It Go"""
3,Not Tim's best,"I bought this CD because of the duet of Tim and Faith Hill, I Need You. It's an amazing song and I absolutely love it! However, the rest of the CD doesn't do much for me. It's not bad, but it's not great either. Some songs are better than others, but the duet is the only one that really stands out to me, although I do enjoy the last track. I can't totally trash this CD, but I just can't highly recommend it either."
3,ho hum,"i'll be honest, i didn't even know i ordered this. i think i was looking at it and must've ordered it by accident, and it came with some other things i do remember ordering. but i like tim mcgraw and decided to give it a try. unfortunately though, i really don't like it. there are a couple of more popular songs on it that i can listen to occasionally, but it's not a cd i'd just leave in and listen to the whole thing. i really like most of his other songs on other cd's so i was pretty disappointed with this one."
3,This CD Will Grow On You!,"I thought this cd was about avergae after my first few listens; yet several months later (and about a million more listens), this cd has really grown on me. Tim's voice has the ability to make the best of avergae material; if you give this cd a few listens, his voice will captivate you and make you fall in love - with him and his songs.My favorite songs on ""Let It Go"" are ""I'm Working"", ""Whiskey and You"", ""Between the River and Me"", ""Kristofferson"" and ""Put Your Loving on Me"". ""Put Your Loving on Me"" is my favorite song on this cd as this displays Tim at his best - raw, sexy, and sensual! A must add to you Tim McGraw collection."
3,It's growing on me,"Didn't like it to start with, other than a couple of songs. The more I listen to it, it's getting better. But not as good as previous albums."
2,The Clay Aiken of country music,"I bought this album for my girlfriend. I'd never spend money on this ridiculous music for myself. This dude is so freaking talentless. He doesn't write his own music, and the songs that he does pick are so treacly, cloying and obvious. Since his wife is simlarly untalented, I wonder if they have writers scribe out their conversations to each other.Let's listen in and see if thier conversations are as lame as their songs.Tim: Woke up this morning to the sunshine in my faceFaith: I ain't wastin' no more tears on you....Tim: My little daughter is the sun that brightens my daysFaith: The rainbows over the corn crops tell me that brighter days are ahead.And there you have it.. Faith Hill and Tim Mcgraw... The Britney Spears and Clay Aiken of country music."
3,Tim McGraw's New Cd,"The CD itself is ok, I wouldn't call it one of his best. After a while of listening to it though, you start to enjoy it more. My favorite songs are: Let it go, Nothin' to die for, and I need you.Overall, I'd buy it again."
3,Songs,"I was expecting more of an upbeat type of music out of Tim, something more like i like it i love it, Hard on the ticker, indian outlaw, something like that...last dollar is a great song"
2,mediocre,"Very simple lyrics, and poppy sound. Come on Tim. What happened to your passion about country music?"
1,Not Mongolian cooking at all,"When I ordered this book, I understood that the cooking had something to do with the Mongol empire. I thought maybe these were recipes that were developed and written down by Chinese cooks during the period when the Mongolians sat on the jade throne. But no! This book is only a collection of recipes from countries that used to be in the Mongol empire. In other words, since the Mongols controlled most of the Eurasian land mass, this book is simply a collection of random recipes from across Asia. It could be called ""Asian Cooking"" rather than ""Imperial Mongolian Cooking."" There is no other theme I could discern like ""Genghis' favorite soups."" Moreover, the book is small and bound in a way that does not make it easily used in a kitchen. Very disappointed with this purchase."
1,This Book Is Very Expensive! Crazy Price,"The price this book here, is insane, because the real price is around US$ 30."
1,Not for children who still believe in Santa Claus - zero stars!,"This book is HORRIBLE. It very plainly states that ""there isn't any real santa claus. Your mom gives you the things on your list"". The author also has kids making fun of another child who still believes in the Easter Bunny and the Tooth Fairy. The children in the book are seven, the same age as my daughter. I just can't believe that a book my first grader can read would flat out say there is no Santa Claus. Stay away from this book if you want your child to still believe in any childhood magic!"
1,THIS BOOK IS HORRIBLE AS ARE ALL OF THE PEE WEE SCOUTS BOOKS.,"I am definitly not a fan of the PEE WEE SCOUTS series. I would bet that the author doesn't have children. These books are full of mean thoughts and actions that I certainly don't want my children exposed to. In Pee Wee Scouts Peanut Butter Pilgrims, all a character (Sonny) needs to do to take a live turkey home from the Turkey farm is to throw a temper tantrum until his mother gives in. In this particular book, children are told that there is not Santa Claus and made fun of if they DO believe in Santa Claus. THIS IS A 3rd GRADE READING LEVEL BOOK! What in the world was Judy Delton thinking when she wrote this? What was the publisher thinking when they published it? Horribly, this was a required reading for my 3rd grader. THANKFULLY, I was there reading with her and able to edit out the unveiling of the ""truth"". I would NEVER EVER reccommend Judy Delton's books to ANYONE, EVER!"
3,Will Serve My Purpose,"This will work but I am weary of cheaply made junk from China. I don't blame the seller, it's what's available. An item like this should be washable. I don't believe it is as I could not find instructions for cleaning. The 'clothing' is poorly sewn and frayed. It's not a toy that would survive in the hands of a kid. I bought it to make physics videos and Dr. Moody will work for that."
5,Follow the story by the music!,Just like you're watching the movie. You can tell exactly what part of the story you're at as the music plays.
4,Great soundtrack,"Great soundtrack, but like most soundtracks from movies it lacks the emotion of the story line involved with each song. If you LOVE the movie and can feel the emotion in the part of the movie the song is for, you will like this. We purchased for our 3 yr old who loves Snow White. She listens to ""I'm wishing"" and ""Hi-HO"", but isn't interested in most of the rest."
4,good soundtrack for halloween,"first of all, i have seen the movie and the hag scares me very much. about the music,it's not good music for children because the orchestral moving creates dark suites. the other part of makin' pies is no exception. i listened to special sort of death on a site called mp3.com and the beginning is very disturbing almost, because it's when the queen appears as the old witch and she plots to destroy snow whiteQueen:(laughing)it's not for you, it's for snow whiteanyways, bye-bye"
5,Best Sound Card Ever,"I purchased this card to work with my Stanton turntable (which has a S/PDIF outout) to transfer my more rare vinyl records to CD. It works brilliantly. It also works seemlessly with with my FrootLoops music creation software as well as my Power DVD 7.0. I am using it in conjunction with a Logitech 5.1 THX surround-sound speaker system. Although it tends to be a little boomy on the low end, the EQ in the X-fi software seems to be able to trim it out. The Beatles Love 5.1 DVD Audio is incredible through this system, not to mention Neil Young/Jonathan Demme Heart of Gold movie in DTS. It is the most expensive card I looked at, but the addition of the external interface controller alone is worth the money."
5,NUMBER ONE SOUND CARD FOR PC AUDIO,"I KNOW THIS IS A NUMBER ONE SOUND CARD FOR PC.THIS SOUND CARD OH MY GOD ITS SO CLEAR BELIVE IT OR NOT.THIS IS RATED NUMBER ONE.YOU CANT SAY HD SOUND CARD ARE BETTER THAN THIS OR DOLBY,THIS IS EVERYTHING FAR FROM HIGH-DEFINITION SOUND.PROS- VERY GOOD SOUND- UNSTOPPABLE- WAY BETTER THAN HIGH -DEF SOUND AND DOLBY ITS COMBINES- TO GOOD TO BE TRUE- TO GOOD TO BE TRUE- YES! NO SOUND CARD IS BETTER THAN THIS- FOR EVERYONE INCLUDING:GAMERS,STUDIO RECORDING AND MANY MORE!!!CONS- CANNOT AFFORD IT TO MUCH MONEY...LOL"
4,So far so Good,My first one worked for about a month then crashed.Kept getting hard drive access failures.Amazon was very good at replacing it asap.The new one works great.Would get 5 stars if the first one worked.
1,Garbage,"I bought this to replace my old laptop hard drive in April. It died in September, so it couldn't even survive half a year. What a piece of work. I lost all of my notes and everything. My old 2003 internal hard drive that came with my Dell laptop still works, as well as my aging hard drive from about 5 years ago. And yet this thing, whatever you want to call it, couldn't last half a year. I will not be buying a WD product again. I suggest you do the same."
3,Had to replace it,Had to send it back to Western Digital because it failed the SMART tests. I had to pay shipping for it too. But WD sent a replacement and it's working fine. Took about 3 weeks from the time I sent it back until the new one arrived. Perhaps if I returned it to Amazon it might have been quicker.
2,Ho Hum,"I bought this to learn more about the Incas and the history of Peru during the period when their civilization flourished. Instead, this plodding documentary focused more on archaeological findings -- lots of information about pottery and woven cloth. Those interested in this aspect of Peruvian history should find this worthwhile. For those wishing to learn more broadly about Incan civilization and its history, you're better off watching the newly released ""Conquistadors"" with Michael Woods."
3,average quality,"Bought these for use with cheese. OK products but just average in quality, but for the price also OK. I would appreciate it if Amazon published the origin of the products in the description. I prefer to buy products made in the USA."
4,Engaging mystery with riveting characters,"In a follow-up to Blood County, Mary Logue continues to follow Claire as she works as an officer in the small-town police station of Fort St. Antoine, Wisconsin. Although still recovering from the deaths of her husband and a good friend, Claire capably leads the investigation into the murder of Jed Spitzler, a man whose life has left his children with a legacy of pain. The more Claire looks into his past, the more she begins to see that Spitzler is not the good 'ol boy he at first seemed to be. Logue skillful intertwines Claire's investigation with her family life and her growing romance with a neighbor, as wekk as the attempts of Spitzler's family to recover from his death. Intriguing throughout, the mystery ends with a twist that few will have predict"
4,Small town murder trenchantly explored,"In her second Claire Watkins murder mystery, author Mary Logue brings a small town to compelling life. This is particularly true of the several children who are portrayed in the novel.An ordinary local farmer, living what appears to be, on the surface, a placid, normal life is raising his family. He's a widower with three children. When he's murdered, investigator Watkins begins to find more to Mr. Jed Spitzler than suspected. Readers will be pleased with the way in which the author has captured the characters in this novel, especially the children. Do not, however, expect a complex puzzle to solve. Excellent writing, pace and descriptions."
1,"the wall, a readers opinion","I first picked up this book in a Library and thought that the historical content meant it couldn't fail to be interesting, I was wrong, I don't like to disparage writers usually, but this book was just boring. It continually underestimates the readers intelligence, with simplistic language and descriptive devices. To be perfectly honest the language was so condescending I found it hard to believe in the characters let alone empathise with it. I have to admit that I did not finish the book, but that in it self is a testimony to how uninspiring I found it"
5,Does exactly what it's supposed to,"Easy to set up (Win XP), worked perfectly to retrieve files off some old disks."
5,Entertaining,"Just quite interesting -- I borrowed the book from my nephew, read it, and found it quite interesting so I purchased this one from Amazon for my son."
5,Best Book for New Highpower Shooter,"This is the best book available for a beginning highpower rifle (HP) shooter, because it contains detailed information on everything you need to know to get started in the sport and progress to higher levels of proficiency.The first four chapters (90 pages) are an overview of the sport, the basics of shooting the HP rifle, and finding and participating in your first match. The next fifteen chapters provide detailed information on every aspect of HP shooting including rifles, other equipment, shooting positions, and match participation. The final six chapters cover all aspects of training and becoming a better shooter.Other books by champion shooters concentrate heavily on shooting techniques, and are well suited to intermediate and advanced shooters. There simply is no other book on the market which provides the new shooter with both the quick overview, and the breadth and depth of detail on every important part of HP rifle shooting."
4,The Sincere Cafe Reviewed,"I was fortuate enough to have Leslee Becker as a professor my freshman year of college, and because of this I picked up her book, not really knowing what to expect. I was pleasantly surprised to find out that I really enjoyed The Sincere Cafe. Leslee creates very memorable characters who are all very mysterious and quirky. She puts ordinary people in ordinary situations and somehow ends up with extraordinary, unusual circumstances. The Sincere Cafe was also very reminiscient of Raymond Carver's work, so if you like him, you will definitely like this book."
4,Winnie the pooh poohs grand adventure,"This cd is for those who love the movie and want to hear the soundtrack outside of the movie. It's cool, but the extra songs are really for young children. The movie and cd is targete I assume to a young audience, but Winnie the ooh I famous for its ability to cater to young an old; male and female. The cd is something you want if you like the music. I did, so I bought it."
1,"Kathy Lee Gifford? or ""Music UN-inspired by the movie""","DEAR WALT DISNEY COMPANY: If you can't find good music, just reuse the songs from the Blustery Day soundtrack. That's the only thing people can remember anyways. This CD was dreadful and in the future please don't utilize any 'pop' stars to write corny ballads that make no sense. Just give us real Winnie the Pooh music-- not this washed up hippy stuff. Thank you."
4,It's OK.,"Hi! I'm Rebecca. I am a Dream Street fan and I heard that Frankie Galasso sings/talks as Christopher Robin. But when I heard Frankie sing he sounded like a girl but, I still bought this CD. I think Winnie the Pooh is cool but, when Frankie sang he sounded really bad. Now I know people will hate me 'cause I 'dis Frankie's singing but, I really love Frankie's singing just not on this CD. Well G2G (Got to Go) now!!!! BYE!!!!!!Rebecca"
4,A collection of (some of) the best songs Ariel has to offer,"I bought this CD having already purchased most of the Little Mermaid soundtracks available. There's only one song on this CD I didn't previously own, which is ""Dance the Day Away"". While I don't regret my purchase for this one above average song, more Jodi Benson biased fans wouldn't find what they are looking for in this CD. Where's the all time classic ""Part of Your World""? Or ""Just a Little Love""? or my personal favourite ""Dreaming""?The cover art is beautiful, and the CD includes a booklet with some hard-to-find lyrics to some of the songs from the TV series. There is also an offer for a free Ariel lithograph, but this expired early 1999 and is pretty much useless.I would only recommend this CD for true Little Mermaid/Ariel fanatics (like myself). For those of you looking for higher quality Jodi Benson vocals, I recommend the classic Little Mermaid Original Soundtrack, ""Splash Hits"" or ""Songs from the Sea""."
5,Music to our ears! (:,Loved these songs as a child and now I get to share them with mine. <3I love being able to make new memories with this classic compilation.
3,Ariel's favorites,"Waiting to get the produce, can't believe it's taken this long. Hope it comes eventually as it's for my Granddaughter."
1,This sucked!,It was so boring! I definitely dont want to go to India or hang out with old European hippies now!!!!!! yuck and boring.
4,Good product for the price,"Like all garden sprayers these days it has a less than optimum sized hole in the ball flow control. I don't know if this is because of economy in building the product and or government mandate controlling the gallon per minute flow thereby forcing the down the size of the flow ball valve orifice. It is not unique to this brand and indeed is found more or less to some extent on all brands, but this one appears to be a bit smaller than a couple of its competitors and that irks me a bit. I remain optimistic that someone, someday, will create an 'industrial' version with a larger ball control valve hole that will flow more water. At least it is metal, a real plus, and will not break the first time you drop it on the ground, nor get brittle in the sun, like the plastic ones do."
1,Leaks,"Normally I do not do reviews, but I was compelled to by this product. I bought it to replace my 10 year old fan spray that is leaking. Right out of the box, the valve leaked worse than the one I was replacing - and I use it on a low pressure system. Looks great and nice solid metal, but for me it is worthless. Recommend you buy another product."
2,too clever for its own good,"The other reviewers are kinder than I--I got 50 pages in before I gave up on the book, annoyed by the author's factual errors; odd attempts at humor, such as making a pun based on a getaway driver's name, Parker; contemporary slang, such as stating that Dillinger's gun was ""righteous heat;"" and down right peculiar observations, such as calling a Kroger grocery store ""a precursor to K-Mart."" There are so many other books on Dillinger that there is no need to wade through this one."
3,Not the best Dillinger book but not the worst.,Of the many Dillinger books on the market this belongs in the upper half but it does have it's flaws. There are many worse books about Dillinger but save your time and money and read the best Dillinger book- Dillinger: The Untold Story by G. Russell Girardin and William J. Helmer.
2,Dillinger as seminal anti-hero/celebrity,"The gist of this book is that Dillinger was a thief, but certainly no worse than the ""assassins"" who executed him, specifically those of the corrupt East Chicago police."
2,Burned again...,"I bought an earlier version that was produced by ""VersaCheck GP7"" and can't convert my customer database at this time.Please AVOID all Cosmi software. I've had trouble with every type personally and with customers and get NO SUPPORT. Reps ignore questions, even for problems (and there are many) not listed in FAQs.The features that work are OK, but the software is dead end. Cosmi has no intention of making sure it works after sale."
2,Das Kapital: A Critque of Political Economy,I think Marx needs to relax and have some sips of vodka far too uptight. In additon should do a reunion with the Marx brothers especially Harpo
2,boring,"i dont understand how a 'movement of the people' cannot bringitself to write in the language of the people. this book is so freaking boring and negative and cynical. jesus christ man.karl, have a coke and a smile. and stop inserting french and5 paragraphs of footnotes on every @#$@#$ page. who doyou expect to get through this mess?"
1,Levitsky's Trash-Job,When I ordered this edition to replace my dog-eared original copy I didn'trealize I would be getting the Readers' Digest version(complete with matching ideology). The introduction was a Milton Friedman travesty doneby the same individual who edited this edition(and eliminated anything that might place his paradigm in question...and it is VERY questionable).I would strongly recommend the unedited(uncensored) version. I think Charles H. Kerr publishing still has it. Caveat Emptor!
1,Abridged,THIS IS AN ABRIDGED VERSION of Das Kaptial. It's cover is plastic-like and the entire thing comes off more like a toy than a book. I recommend getting a different one.
2,At first disappointing ... but still worth it for Gilman's fans,"Other reviewers have already elaborated on why it is disappointing. It's probably the weakest Gilman book I have read. If you approach it without any expectations, however, it still can be an entertaining and (very) light reading."
4,If only . . .,I got so absorbed in the characters and stories I began to accept the Madame's psychic ability. If only I could do that!
3,"Simplistic writing, interesting psychic story","Psychic Madame Karitska uses her psychometry (ability to learn about a person by touching something that they owned or held) to help the police and her clients. A wide range of people from all walks of life find their way into her storefront office and Karitska gives them all coffee, tea, or chocolate, then deals with their problems as best she can. Although not all results are positive, Karitska manages to help her clients avoid a wide range of far worse fates.Author Dorothy Gilman offers a kaleidoscope of human life as a wide range of clients bring their problems to Karitska. Through Karitska, most learn about themselves rather than about their supposed questions--and that, of course, is the point.Gilman's writing is simplistic. KALEIDOSCOPE is approachable by young readers and may seem somewhat too simple for adult readers. Still, the novel has its rewards and, in many ways, Karitska is a charming character."
5,Kaleidoscope: A Countess Karitska Novel,"I loved it! I am so glad that after all the years, a sequel was written to the Clairvoyant Countess. It is so nice to read a book with warm, loving characters overcoming evil in a terrible world. I just desperately hope that Dorothy Gilman will write a sequel NOW!!! (Pretty please Dorothy?)"
2,Outdated Software & Age Rating Too High,"My 6 year old son was very uninterested in this game. It is extremely slow moving. You give feedback then wait a few seconds, then you watch the character do something, then you get to give the next input. Felt like a lifetime between when you can interact again. Imagine how long that is to a six year old. He didn't last five minutes. The material was more like for a preschooler or kindergartener. Also, keep in mind that this is an older version of the game. It's pretty much obsolete now."
5,Pretty much the best!,"Did alot of research on different cleaners and kept on getting this one as a leader across the board. Put this in my Porsche 944 Turbo when i first bought it and found a significant difference in how it idled, ran, and accelerated. I will keep running this in my car every so often to keep the engine clean."
4,Kewl!,"Many times have I heard people comment on how weak Busted are. I must say I enjoyed this cd and I definitely will be keeping an eye on them. Their music is not ground-breaking nor is it bad - it's inbetween which is the reason for my four star rating. You either like them or you don't, and I'm quite happy listening to this cd as I'm sure many others will be too!"
5,Wish it were in the States,"I love this album, I wish Amazon.com held more products by them, all tehir products are on the UK one and we cant get them here without a ton of shipping! I hope they come to the states, i think they'd do well. I'm tired of the rap here and hilary duff! Gimme some Busted!"
5,dont judge them like i did! they're NOT horrible!,"ok, i'll be first to admit that when i heard of Busted i thought ""ew, another boy band? from england? is this like the guys version of atomic kitten?"" im not dissing british music b/c i am the biggest coldplay fan you'll ever meet and i also like Dido. but another boy band didnt appeal to me. then, i heard this new Busted album and i was very surprised! i luvvvv it! i listen to it all the time! i like it b/c even though its mostly about love and stuff, its funny and not too mushy or cheesy (like n-sync). even if u dont like the other stuff that ""people who bought Busted also bought"" (cuz i hate atomic kitten and 3rd eye blind and stuff) you WILL like busted! they're just so good! and no, im not 11 either, im in high school! surprise surprise! all i can say now is i hope busted comes to the usa!"
5,A Present For Everyone - Busted,"15 tracks not only written by the Busted boys but about their lives. It kicks off with the typial cheeky Busted song Air Hostess to warm you up and then goes from sad to happy with that ace Busted edge that means you cannot feel down! When I listened to this the first time I thought ""Not bad"" and the second time I thought ""This is quit cool"" and by the third time I was sold. Anothe stroke of genius by those talented and, not to mention good looking, Busted boys. Carry on this track Matt, Charlie and James.They rock"
3,Only 2,"The description doesnt not mention quantity in the package. There are only 2 planks. These are disposable, 1 time use only. I soaked the plank in water for over 24 hours, grilled the salmon on low over indirect heat and the plank got so burned we were not able to reuse it."
4,Quick Country Christmas Quilts,"An oldy but goodie. Things change and then again they don't, just become recreated into something else. Nice to have ""original"" designs that probably came from an even older version incorporated with the new materials of our time."
5,love it!,it is cute and comfy! the size is just right.my girlfriend loves it very much.no weird smell or whatsoever.
5,GREAT FUN AND A STIMULATING GAME TO BOOT.,"My grandson came across this game in a cabin we rented out 1.5 years ago. It is very fun and entertaining as one person describes a person, an event, a word, etc. and his/her partner has to guess what is the word. Creativity is also a key to winning at this game; and the longer one plays the better he/she gets."
4,a good improvement,"I had put atleast 2K rds throuh the B.E. with the hard plastic grips. Most of that was in training while hands were sweaty. So, I never really had a problem with the stock grips, but the more I held the weapon I could just tell I would prefer something with a little more grip to it. I have small to medium hands and the grips are not too large, they feel great to me, it is actually the only mod I've done to the pistol. I think they greatly improve the feel of the weapon and would buy them again, tomorrow, if mine disappeared."
1,Does not fit the Jericho,"I bought this for my IMI Baby Eagle 9mm, polymer. It does not fit. If you don't have a screw hole in the bottom left of your grip, don't buy it."
2,Fat Grip,This grip installed very easy but that is where the good stops.It makes the gun feel fat in your hand and the finger notches don't feel natural.I have large hands and my son has slim hands and we both do not like the feel.
5,Great Grips,"Great grips, slight tacky feeling compound and they really give a full feeling to the pistol. Tight to get on but they did fit with a little finessing."
3,Blitz,Length:: 0:11 MinsI am giving this one only three stars because it just is not as cool as I thought it would be. It's still a nice SD Gundam but I was expecting too much I guess. I think it was just not enough of a challenge and it just turned out to look too plain to me. Others may love it but I just like it. It was easy to put together. There was not much to paint (I still did a little) so this may be a plus to some. Well anyways check out my video and maybe this will help you decide.
3,Europa,can't really rate this one because I neglected to see it was on Cassette. Still looking for a cassette player. I was after a CD
4,"A DISNEY ""MUST"" FOR YOUR ENJOYMENT","Pinocchio is the ideal Disney Character that should be in everyone's heart and an All-Time Favorite! The music throughout this animated film is a delight and remains with you, forever, especially, ""When You Wish Upon a Star."""
1,Absolutely AWFUL!,"You would think a Championship special for a basketball obsessed fan base and program like Kentucky, would put together a stellar DVD. That is not even close to what this piece of garbage is. The editing is choppy and the narration is incorrect and all over the place. Its as if this was put together by an amateur high school media student. You would have the narrator saying one thing while something completely different was on the screen. Then the highly anticipated rematch with Indiana in the Sweet 16 is only given TWO PLAYS! A foul by Davis in the first half and a rebound in the final seconds of the game. Then the national title game gets maybe 3 plays worth of highlites and then it cuts to the team driving into Rupp Arena for the celebration and then abruptly ends.DO NOT BUY THIS DVD! Cross your fingers and hope CBS puts together an official DVD because this is absolutely a waste of money. There are better youtube videos out there of the 2012 Kentucky Basketball season."
2,Not what I expected,"This video highlights the year but not very well and don't expect to see the final game. In fact the final game barely shows for more than a few seconds. It is hard to follow at times, they don't label but the most important games. The video jumps around a lot too. Not worth it unless you just have to have all things Kentucky. Sorry I wasted my money."
1,NOT RECOMMENDED,THIS DVD IS SO INCOMPLETE THAT I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND BUYING....THERE IS NOT COMMENTS ABOUT DAVIS SETTING RECORDS FOR BLOCKED SHOTS ESPECIALLY WHEN HE BROKE SHAQ'S RECORD FOR BLOCKED SHOTS. NO COMMENTS ABOUT WHO IS GOING PRO. NO COMMENTS ABOUT WHITE HOUSE VISIT.
3,"Its the only option, but it if you want","This DVD falls in line with most other ""Year in Review"" DVDs that I've bought over the years. Lots of video highlights but there isnt a whole lot of interview footage. Not a lot of in depth background story for the big games like the Louisville Kidd-Gilchrist display. This is a decent video but they could've done better."
3,"beautiful images, lousy binding","For an expensive hardcover book in a slipcase, the binding on this book is very poor -- it cracks when a page is turned. Merely glued in, like a cheap paperback novel, the pages are coming loose. The reproduction of the manuscript's illuminations is very good, with beautiful, intense colors and with a layer of gold-colored ink that hints at the richness of gold leaf."

4,Suspense no doubt!,"This was a thrill ride for Cara Fleming and her husband Mario. I enjoyed the way the author kept you guessing until the final word, and even then you were left with the thought ""there could be a sequel you know"" (smile). This novel has set the stage for a wonderful future in writing by Margie Gosa Shivers, and I do look forward to all her efforts in writing. Stay Blessed!Much Respect, Linda Washington-Johnson,Jackson Mississippi Readers Club Reviewer"
5,Anonymity - A Page turning Suspense Novel,"I would like to give my comments about the book Anonymity. This book was extremely well written and very good reading. It's something I would like to see come to the screen. You know like a made for TV movie (Lifetime get ready). When the book was first released, we were able to get a review of the first few chapters on-line. Once I started reading it was very difficult for me to get back to work doing my job. I couldn't wait to get my hands on my own personal copy. My friend and I were delighted to get a chance to meet Mrs. Shivers in person at her book signing out in Hyde Park, IL back in November 2002. I have my copy of the re-edited version and I can't wait to sink my teeth into it.=)Looking forward to Mrs. Shivers' next novel! Go Get 'em Margie!Nedra (Let's Talk Book Club)."
3,"Secrets, secrets, secrets...","In this intriguing tale of suspense we are introduced to Cara Fleming, a young wife and mother whose life seems to be going along pretty well. That is, until her husband accuses her of infidelity. Not understanding why her husband believes ""the proof"" he received from an anonymous phone call, Cara sets out to prove her innocence. While on this mission, Cara stumbles upon a family secret that, if in the wrong hands, could destroy the lives of many, including her husband.Full of twists and turns, ""whodunits"", mystery and suspense, I found this to be an enjoyable read. There were some parts of the story, though, that I had to re-read because I was left wondering what happened, causing it to be a bit disjointed. Possessing the ability to create both a strong plot and well defined characters, Ms. Shivers has what it takes to become a great mystery writer, and I look forward to her future works.Reviewed by Renee Williamsof The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers"
4,"A good ""Whodunit"" Tale","Margie Gosa Shivers wove an intricate tale of romance, revenge, mystery and intrique when she penned ANONYMITY. I found this to be an enjoyable read that captured my attention."
5,"""Anonymity"" A Suspense Web Wrap","Who Framed Cara Fleming?""Anonymity"" is a Suspense Web Wrap that will keep its' readers on the edge up to the last second. The subtle subduction adds to the suspense. It will take you on a tour of beautiful Chicago and to chic restaurants. Marge's catchy, descriptive style gives Anonymity a romantic appeal.I highly recommend Anonymity.Creola A. Colon, AuthorLadyPitt PublicationsP. O. Box 17103Rockford, IL 61110www.cacolon.com"
1,The Book Was Drab and Boring,"I read this book last year for my bookclub(Asthepageturns) and it was horrible. Poorly written, long, drab storylines, little characther development.I am not looking forward to anything else this author has to write. She might want to take a few lessons form J. California Cooper, Pearl Cleage, Karen Quinones Miller, Jill Nelson, whomever!Don't waste your money...pick it up at the library if you have to read it."
2,Disappointing,"After much research on the influenza outbreak of 1918, I was looking forward to a nicely done synopsis (which is what the American experience usually does). This wasn't it. The video states as fact items that are not fact and ends the program in October, after the first wave of the flu, when a second wave came in late Nov/ early December. The personal narratives were wonderful, but I would reccomend viewing this video only AFTER gaining a broad knowledge of the epidemic, otherwise, it is doing a great disservice."
2,"read ""The Great Influenza"" instead","like the other reviewers here, I found this a major disappointment. The good news is, a truly oustanding book came out this year (2004) ""The Great Influenza: The Epic Story of the Deadliest Plague in History"" by Barry will tell you all you wnat to know about this, and it will also give you some terrific history besides, that you would not ordinarily connect with disease (politics, war, the press, etc). An older review here, written apparently before this book was published, mentioned 2 other books. Alfred Crosby's ""America's forgotten Epidemic"" is also a very good book, tho not nearly as good as Barry's. It is however shorter. Gina Kolata's book-- skip it. It has little to do with events of 1918; it's really about now-dated current scientists digging up bodies lookign for the virus. Barry gives you a far better understanding of both science and the virus."
3,Pretty good,I did pretty good picking a color for this not knowing really which one-the only problem I've had is that it is thicker than normal & hard to even get to run out of the bottle-don't understand this. Clinique shd be good no matter what-I've even had to dip out w/a q-tip that how thick it is.
3,It's good but not great,"This DVD was previously released under the title ""Dark Souls"". I know because the actual program says it at the beginning. Someone just slapped a new cover on it. Anyway, It's really not that bad if you're interested in every nook and cranny of Metallica's history up to the St. Anger album. Granted, there is no music by Metallica on here. One good thing about the disc is the trivia game. Me and a friend of mine had some pretty good fun with that one to see who was the biggest 'tallica fan. If you're just trying to expand your Metallica collection and really really really like them, then it's at least worth checking out. Like I said.. it's decent for an unauthorized film, but it's not exactly worth flipping over either."
2,Low Grade Bio of Metallica,"This is an amatuer documentary of Metallica that is more suited to Cable TV than an actual DVD that you purchase. The show doesn't even play any Metallica music in the background, instead some unknown band. Don't purchase this unless it is given to you for free"

4,Effective for my issues,"I have used yellowdock for over a year as one of my supplements for ""female"" issues and find it to be very helpful. Herbal supplements definitely affect different people in different ways. I had developed a gigantic uterine cyst and had a hysterectomy this year. Yellowdock helped, and still helps, me to have less bleeding. It also helped me to have less cramps and pain when I used to have a period. I no longer have a period but I can have bleeding and discomfort if I do not keep up with the same supplements I have always used to help with hormonal issues: yellowdock, vitex, black cohosh, soy, and omega fatty acids.They way I take yellowdock or any herbal liquid is to mix a dropperful into a small amount of juice in a shot glass and take it like a shot."
1,Yellow Dock,The product it self may not be awful. As a result of using the product my monthly was extremely heavy and lasted way longer than usual. Not good. I hate my monthly.
3,It's alright,"College bound. . .or so he thought. Failed the exam to get into prestigious Tokyo University. Gets set upon by his cousin. . .and falls for another college girl in the process of failing exam, but lives the lie of saying he is a student. . .fail."
3,an ok comedy,"""the sakura diaries"" is a romantic comedy about a love triangle taking place in college (with some sex jokes thrown in). sounds good? well, first off the dubbing was a bit annoying. urara's voice is VERY annoying. it just makes you cringe at times! but anyway the jokes will make you smile, the quality is ok, and the characters are pretty good. as for how long it lasts... one viewing is enough and that's what makes it average."
1,"Sexy? Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!","They must have left the sexy parts out of the copy I rented to preview the series - rented because something seemed fishy about the reputation. This is for 10-year olds who think a dweeb drooling for a babe is funny... All those ""sexy"" comments are the video maker's public relations department trying to make it racy and trap the viewer with. Anyone who likes movies that are mature (married couples, lovers, etc.) will find it stupid and juvenile. On the other hand, if you like fairly silly, goofy, repressed...shows, this is for you!"
4,Solid Anime,"The Sakura Diaries Anime was based mostly upon the manga made by ""U-Jin,"" a pseudonym for the creator of this very mature title. Although somewhat different from the manga, the anime still keeps some of the character bases and plot developments static. In an attempt to reach a more cultured audience the creator veered from his usual pure perversion and made the title a very deep and engrossing show. Any sex scenes that are in this title are important for plot development and characterization. This is a great title for adults who want to experience a more ""mature"" cartoon, but keep the kids away from it."
3,Didn't work for me,"I had that idea that this would be a nice way to lose weight. But I found the book very complicated tot work with. You have to go back and forth through many pages in order to understand what they are talking about and to get the exercises in order which is very annoying when you want to do the 'workout' that you pick. It won't stay open, so basically what you have to do is write and draw everything on a worksheet. Which will take you hours and hours.I'm not a quitter, I gave up on this one though. Working out at the gym since two years now."
4,"Good overall, but problems with lids","I bought two 18 oz Kanteens, one with a loop lid and the other with a flat lid. Though the Kanteen is a good size and easy to hold and clean, the lids have been a problem. The flat lid doesn't always feel like an air-tight seal, probably because of the metal-on-metal connection. It is, however, easier to open than the loop lid, which is very difficult to open unless you have very strong hands or a screwdriver handy."
5,I LOVE these!,"These water bottles are excellent. I was worried about the width of the top and how easy it would be to drink from, but it is perfectly fine."
4,Good purchase,"I liked this product. It is rather heavy when it is full, but it also holds a lot of water so that is to be expected. It looks good, and has been fairly easy to clean. Overall, a solid purchase."
4,"Good product, no issues",I order three different Klean Kanteen bottles (of various sizes) and all have been good. No metallic or other smells. Do heed the warning on the bottles - these are not for warm or cold drinks - they are not insulated.
5,I LOVE these bottles!,"I have 3 Klean Kanteen bottles, that should speak for itself! I bought one a while back that is just silver (27 oz), someone gave me the cotton candy pink (27oz) and I just bought the 18oz blue to bring to school. I will say this-I think the 27oz is PERFECT! I barely use my new 18oz as it just doesn't hold enough water for me. And I originally bought the sport top to go with my pink one and I like that best for quick easy access, but it does make noise when drinking from it-so if you don't want to stick out in a very quiet room-just use the regular top and unscrew it. I also went to EMS (sports store - REI or similar sports store should have it) and bought the cleaning scrubber (with long handle) and I LOVE it! It is a must have for waterbottles! I love the clean water taste from these and they never leak (my plastic bike bottles do). 5 Stars from this Boston Girl!"
4,great,"I bought the 12 oz bottle in blue for my son's lunch box and it's great. I also bought the sports cap to go with it. The sports cap is very difficult for my 4-year old to open so I have some issues with that but the bottle itself is excellent. It keeps his milk cold all day and it washes very well, retaining none of that ""old milk"" smell."
5,nice bottle,"I got the bottle for its re-usability, so I could always have some water at my desk, and so I could cover it to keep the water inside fresh. It's met all my expectations."
5,great size for juice,i love that it's fits in my lunch case. It's perfect for juice. I will be getting other sizes for workouts.
5,"Nice, but maybe too big","I really like this bottle, but I might have over stretched on the 40 oz. Its a little big for my liking. But, I can attach it to my backpack without much of an issue and the added volume may come in handy.Will probably order a smaller one as well."
1,Leaks constantly; threw it away,"Bought this for my 8-yr-old daughter. It is not possible for her to push the closure cap down hard enough, reliably enough, for bottle not to leak all over her schoolwork. I have difficulty closing it myself. It may be a bum bottle, but it appears to be constructed as intended.Threw it away."
1,never again,"Since this is not leakproof (I didn't realize it when I ordered), and since it is not insulated (again, its features weren't clear when I ordered), I'd neither recommend this or consider buying another. THIS one will go to Goodwill."
1,Defect,Love the colors however item from Amazon came with a defect. Side had a crack that can barely be seen and water kept leaking. Very disappointed.*REPLACEMENT ORDER CAME and the product was damaged once again. Disappointed. There was a 1.5 inch very visible scratch on top of the logo. I don't know if it's Amazon or Klean Kanteen but I have been disappointed twice.Probably will not purchase again.
2,"Stain, uncovered","I bought 4. Three are covered by the plastic. Except 1 has spoil, dust on it without plastic as the others. The product's careness of the seller is not really good."
3,Good idea,I bought this bottle and enjoyed the crips clean taste however don't drop it. Mine slipped out of my arm and landed on the corner of the bottom and no longer would stand up. It was a excellent product except for that.
1,The bottle leaks,"I bought this bottle with the poly sport cap for my son to use in school on a daily basis. The bottle has really nice color and feels a bit more sturdy than the SIGG bottles I have bought in the past.However,the bottle leaks no matter how hard I try to tighten the cap - whenever the bottle is not upright,it starts leaking slowly but instantly - not enough to lose most of the water in the bottle but more than enough to wet whatever container it is in. So bags/backpacks get wet.Leaking seem to be such a basic quality issue that I didn't expect any leaking for Klean Kanteen (and have never bought a bottle that leaked). With this ""defect"" product that is under $20, it seems exchanging/returning is a lot of hassle. So I have kept the bottle. I will be very hesitant to buy another one in the future and wouldn't recommend it based on my, hopefully less common, experience."
3,It is okay. But.....,"I bought a 12 ounce classic sport cap for my 5 years old daughter. Because some of the reviews said the colored one's do chip off, I got the original silver one though my daughter would have been much happier with colored one. It is nice to have stainless steel water bottle. The mouth of the bottle is wide so it makes cleaning easy. My complaint is that it leaks therefore I couldn't put it in my daughter's lunch box. And another thing is that it makes squiky sound when drinking. I previously have purchased a hello kitty sigg brand water bottle. And this doesn't have the leakage or makes squiky sound. My daughter is Happier with sigg water bottle. Because it is colorful and it does not make the sound when she drinks out of it. I would recommend klean kanteen if you do not mind about above problems."
4,"Great product, only one flaw with the sport cap...","I LOVE my Kleen Kanteens. I recently ordered one for each of my children, and my only dislike, is the ""whistling"" sound they make when drinking from the sport cap. It isn't a huge deal, b/c usually, when we are using them, it doesn't matter if noise is made (like at the zoo or other outing). But on occasion, we are somewhere needing to be quiet. Nothing more embaressing than having your water bottle hum when you take a drink. But, the convenience of the sport cap is worth this little annoyance in the long run. I just wish KK could do something to avoid this. Oh, it also will leak if on it's side. Not great, but we only use ours w/ water, so not usually a big deal. i am just aware of it and try to keep them upright. Again, this would not be an issue if we had the screw on caps."
1,It leaks! Bad design!,It killed my phone when it leaked in my bag. The cap does not close properly. Very poorly made! Save your money and headache!
1,Awful Taste!,"Like everyone else I purchased one of these to keep myself from the toxins in our plastic water bottles. I couldn't stomach the awful taste of the water from these. The water tasted of metal. I washed it with baking soda, then vinegar and still the taste remained. So, I'm back to plastic and drinking more water than ever. Huge waste of money for me!"
3,"Nice bottle, but is it worth the price?","I really like this bottle, and it has been quite nice to drink out of. I only have two complaints. Mine doesn't completely close to seal the water from pouring out if let's say the bottle is tipped a bit. And another thing is the price. If you don't mind paying up, it's prob the best bottle, but it is just a bottle after all."
2,Whistling Water Bottle,This water bottle is well made - I have no complaints about the bottle itself. However I was shocked to hear a noisy whistle coming out of the top while I was drinking. This was actually embarrasing because I was in a quiet room! If you are purchasing this for outdoors or don't mind the whistle then I would say buy it. However if the noise would bother you I would stick to a SIGG water bottle.
1,Poly Sport 2.0 Cap leaked,"I purchased the 12-oz bottle for my son to take to school, figuring it would be a good size for his lunch box. The sport cap leaked after two uses. I returned it and got another bottle with a sports cap; that leaked after one use. For good measure, I returned that one and got a third bottle with a sport cap; that leaked before he even got a chance to use it. The water bottle itself is a great little product but I had absolutely no luck with the sports cap."
2,"Yes, they rust inside. Low quality now.","I agree with the poor rating. I've bought KleenKanteen, and within a year, it started rusting inside. None of the other brands we own do this. No more of these for me."
2,It's better than buying bottled water,"I've had my Klean Kanteen for 1 month so far and I'm not too happy with it. I got it mainly because it had so many positive reviews.My major gripe is with the poly sport cap. IT LEAKS ALL THE TIME. Even when i have securely closed it off, it still leaks whenever it's laying on the side. I'm majorly disappointed that a water bottle has so much trouble keeping water INSIDE.If you're intent on getting this canteen, i highly recommend the simple flat or loop cap, definitely not the sport cap (or another canteen altogether)"
5,Going Green,Last year I purchased the Klean Kanteen Water Bottles for my adult children and their spouses. They loved them but complained about the caps. This year I purchased 4 sports caps (they didn't come with that at the time). I also purchased the bottles for all my eight grandchildren and one for myself with the sports caps attached. Great bottles especially since they now come with the sport cap.
5,Kleen Kanteen is Clean,The best price available was on Amazon. The Kleen Kanteen is safe and friendly to use.
2,cracked the first day,"I purchased this item to get away from plastic bottles and because of all the good things I had heard about Klean Kanteen. However, the first day I used it (40oz- filled over half way with water) I dropped it from my hand to my wood floor (I am only 5'1"") and it split/cracked near the bottom and water started leaking out. Hopefully, this was just a defect bottle. I did return it and received my refund. Another factor that I don't like about these bottles is the cap leaks if you don't tighten it ALL the way, making it hard to unscew and annoying if you want a quick drink when working out. They need to change the cap to be more like Nalgene."
4,gets the job done,"Good water bottle. Yay for environmentally friendly conservation!I ordered 2, one for my sister and one for myself. My sis's had a tiny rust colored spot on the inside bottom of her bottle that doesn't want to come off even after cleaning with vinegar water solution. Because the bottle is slender and her hand can't fit in to scrub it out she tried to rub it off using a wooden chopstick.Mine was perfectly fine. The ""Orange"" sunset is not really a bright orange, more like a Butterscotch color."
5,Why are you still using plastic?,"These bottles (I've bought 2) are wonderful, and work just as they were reported to have worked. I am very pleased. There is no possibility of it leaching BPA's, and the bottle itself is extremely light! (Once you fill it up, though, you realize how much water weighs!) LOLIt cleans well, keeps water as fresh as can be, and is GREAT for the environment. (Mind you: If you put ice in the bottle, it cools the contents fairly quickly, but the ice WILL melt quickly, too. It is NOT a cooler, after all- just a wonderful, clean, good-for-the-environment bottle, and I highly recommend it."
1,"If you want ruggedness, this is not your bottle.","I used it lightly for 1 week at School, and one day I barely tapped the mouth on something and it bent, and now the lid does not seal. Also, my stainless loop cap broke in half the same day. Maybe I just got unlucky, but not worth the $20+ IMO."
1,I should've read the reviews more carefully :(,It DOES smell like metal and the water taste like metal :(I should've read the reviews more carefully. I wouldnt have had to go through trouble ofreturning it! :(
1,"The Klean Kanteen ""18/8"" I tested was Magnetic - Hmm...","I bought a 40 oz stainless steel bottle at a local store, but had to return it. To test the quality of my new bottle, I used a refrigerator magnet. Quality 18/8 steel is typically not magnetic. To my surprise, this bottle was. The magnet also stuck to most of the 40 oz and 28 oz Klean Kanteen bottles that I tested at the store (attraction to bottles varied). The 28 oz I bought last year was fine (the magnet had almost no attraction).Magnetism suggest heavy metals in the steel, such as nickel. Nickel is a known carcinogen (http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/tfacts15.html). My fridge magnet did not stick (had zero attraction) to the other 18/8 stainless brands found in the store. I bought them instead. Test for yourself - it's easy to do so. For me, NOT so clean kanteen..."
3,Great idea but NOT flawless,"As another reviewer mentioned, this bottle chirps loudly when you drink from it. My wife and I both have one and she quit taking it to work because it makes so much noise when you drink out of it. Her co-workers made fun of it. Also, the air vent on the sports cap will leak water if it falls over in your bag. I just finished drying out my briefcase because of a leak through the cap.I have never noticed ANY metallic taste, so I disagree with other reviewers on that. When you first get the bottle, it does smell a little metallic, but after washing it before using, I never noticed it. I have used mine every day for the past 6 months.If Klean Kanteen can just come up with a better (sports) cap design, this would be 5 stars."
3,poor quality control,Ordered 4 bottles from website-direct. Great service. However- the threads on the bottle spouts were too far down the neck for the flat top cap to stay screwed on. Also- the metal-to-metal screw caps are very rough in use. And- the bottles were all different diameters and heights. Weird. Poor quality control. Good company- bad product. The only great part is that they are food grade stainless. I had to go to a local store and swap out all four bottles and re-match 4 caps to get any kind of fit. Still- one bottle just will not fit- so am sending it back. Poor quality control.
4,"Thick High Quality Steel, Cap needs improvement","Cap could use some improvement, better than other bottle due to having vent whole that can be close using a rubber piece. Great quality and size."
2,Unnecessary,"As I was reading up on the harms of drinking from plastic, I decided to invest in a stainless steel klean kanteen bottle. I ordered the stainless steel flat cap. Within a week, the plastic top kept coming off the top of the steel lid. By that time though, I realized I didn't like the steel taste or smell of the water and the loud screwing/unscrewing of the metal cap, so it wasn't worth fixing. I purchased a glass bottle at the grocery store for $1.50 and have been so much happier drinking out of that. I would gladly return the steel bottle, but I'm afraid I just put it on the back burner too long and now they probably wouldn't take it back. Either way, it was a regretful decision and a poor purchase for me. If you are dead set on purchasing a steel water bottle, however, my only advice is to stay away from the flat top steel cap, because it is very poorly constructed."
5,Great for kids lunch boxes,"I needed a better solution for drinks in my daughters lunch boxes. I gave up juice boxes because of the price and the amount of trash they put into our environment. I had bought plastic water bottles to fill with our own water, juice, milk etc, only to find out that these bottles were made with chemicals which could end up in the girls drinks. The 12oz Klean Kanteen water bottles are great! They are a perfect size for the lunch boxes, they don't leak and I know that my daughters drinks are chemical free. We have had them for a month and they have no dents or scratches. I would highly recommend the Klean Kanteen water bottles!"
4,No more plastic!!!!,"Kinda inspired by The Office, I decided to finally buy myself a stainless steel water bottle so I would no longer have to use plastic bottles or cups to drink in my office (or anywhere else that I might need it).This was a good choice as it doesn't leave a metallic aftertaste in my water, and it has that beautiful blue color. I also like the option of having more then one cap, like Klean Kanteen offers (although I haven't taken advantage of it quite yet)."
2,2 stars for the Sports Cap,It sounds like a bird chearping eveytime I take a drink. My son's friend who has the same one also makes the same sound.
4,40 oz - black: Great water bottle!,"I love these bottles. I've owned the 40 oz black bottle with the poly loop cap for about six months. I keep it at work and use it every day. My coworkers love its sleek look; I get quite a few ""Wow, that's a cool looking bottle!"" comments. Besides that, the water tastes great, no metallic taste at all.These bottles will dent fairly easily, but at least there aren't any interior epoxy coatings to worry about cracking. The paint on the bottom did wear off with frequent use (you can get the plain steel one if you worry about that). The poly loop cap can be difficult to open if you tighten it enough to keep it from leaking. It does sweat a lot with cold beverages, as most bottles do. None of these things bothered me except the cap being too tight.Overall, it's a great bottle, and I bought an extra one to keep at home. It makes it convenient and easy for me to have my 8+ glasses of water a day with two trips to the sink instead of 10."
4,Klean Kanteen,I enjoy the look and size of the bottle. The only thing is that the bottle tends to sweat when there is ice inside. Also even though the size of the mouth is great for adding ice you must be careful as to not spill. Overall I am very happy with my purchase.
4,"Good Sport Top, Tight Seal, No Metallic Taste","The kanteen is just as I wanted it to be and the sport cap is well made with a tight seal. I would have given it 5 stars except that one of the two I ordered makes an odd noise when I drink from it. I think it has something to do with the tiny plastic air vent in the top, as the other one is quiet."
4,Lean but mean,"This is a great product, lite but sturdy, has not leaked and works great with the sports top. I use it at work, in the car and at the gym. The only thing I don't like about it is that the steel is so thin that if you drink anything very cold or very hot you can feel it right through the canteen to the degree where you cannot hold it. DO NOT PUT THIS CANTEEN IN THE FREEZER IT WILL WARP THE SHAPE! In spite of those few limitations this is the best water bottle/canteen I have ever owned."
4,Works great!,"I purchased the 18oz. bottle with a steel flat cap and I am thoroughly enjoying it. Especially with all of the recent hoopla concerning plastic water bottles and how dangerous toxins are being released from the interior surface of them, I had to get something safer.The only reason I did not give it a five-star rating is simply because I feel you have to turn the cap a bit too much to get it to close. That is, the threads could have used one less 'turn', I believe. Other than that, I recommend this product! Next time I get one (which will be soon), I'll most likely try the one with the poly cap instead."
3,Leaks too much,"We got the sports top bottle for our 6-yr old, and the sippy top one for our toddler. The sports top leaks in our son's lunch box no matter how securely it is closed. He still likes it, and his water is much fresher tasting now compared to the plastic sippy-straw cups he'd been using, but I wouldn't buy this product again due to the leaking. I put a folded up napkin under the bottle every day, and he uses it to wipe his hands (it's always soaked through by the end of the day due to the slow leak). The sippy bottle has worked fine, though."
2,"Klean Kanteen with Flat Cap, (18 oz)",The size is good but the second one we ordered leaked. The cap did not fit... The after taste is not so strong but very difficult to see the difference from an ordinary stainless steel container/warmer which costs only $6-$10 dollars in the market around. Too pricy and the thin plastic cap does not match well with the product.
1,"smells bad, hard to open","Have had this rather expensive bottle, paid $18, for several years. I carry RO water to work and have several brands/types of bottles. No matter how I clean this one, it smells foul if water sits in it for over a day or so. The lid is also so hard to grip to open that I often have to stick a pen through the hole for leverage, and it makes an obnoxious squeak noise. I avoid drinking from this one while driving because the wide mouth always splashes water down my shirt. Much prefer the taste of water from a cheap aluminum bottle. Have other brands of stainless bottles that don't stink like this one too. I assume it is something with the lid that makes it smell bad, but don't really know."
2,Leaks!,"It would be helpful to simply shove the bottle in my bag with all the other stuff I'm carrying to the office or other places but this bottle requires *special* treatment and must always be upright b/c it leaks. Doesn't leaking defeat the purpose of having a water bottle?There's a written disclaimer on the label attached to the bottle that it must always be upright or it will leak which I did not notice until my friend pointed it out.I received this as a gift and now I leave it in the fridge as my ""quick cold water grab"" and that's it.I would not recommend this product for more than fridge storage use and will not buy one for myself."
2,Tasted like metal,"I'm tryin to drink more water, and I thought a Klean Kanteen would be better for me than some plastic water bottle. I couldn't even use it. It tasted and smelled like metal, even after a few weeks. I guess some of us are just more sensitive to the metallic taste than others.I eventually got a Sigg and I much, much prefer it. No funny taste or smell. Also, a little cuter."
4,Klean Kanteen works for us.,"The Kanteen is just the right size, 12 oz., to carry around. The water tastes good, with no concerns about plastic leaching into it."
4,Nice vertical canteen,"Throw a few ice cubes in, fill with water and you're good to go. Have not detected any metallic taste and thewide mouth makes for quick thirst quenching. I like the loop top because it's easy to carry on one finger ifmy arms are full. The top does squeak so, if I'm in a meeting, it can be a little distracting."
4,Reliable Water Source,"18/8 Steel is nothing special-the canteen does what is expected of it. It is extremely easy to dent, so make sure you buy a case to hold it-the cases by built are good for insulation but not for protection-get yourself something similar to a Maxpedition Bottle HolderMaxpedition 10""x 4"" Nalgene Bottle Holder Khaki. The D Ring cap is a great addition, but isn't necessary-I wish they offered getting the different cap from the start. Easy to keep clean, and probably the cheapest 40oz bottle on the market right now. I carry it with me everywhere. If your looking for a larger, steel alternative to Nalgene bottles, get this sucker."
5,Just what I was looking for,"I purchased this bottle as an alternative to using plastic bottles that didn't stay cold for very long. I love my KK! The water always stays cool and great-tasting, no metal-y taste at all! I bought the pink, 27-ounce bottle with a poly loop cap. The cap is secure and I haven't had any problems with it leaking in my bag. I take it with me to school and to my fitness classes. Overall it's a great product and I would highly recommend it!"
5,great bottle - get diff lid,great waterbottle - love the color and the style. I was afraid it would have a metal odor like the last one I purchased (different brand) and was happy to find that it didn't. The sport lid made a squeaking noise when I drank out of it and did not seal so I ended up buying the original lid in addition and now no longer use the sport one at all.
5,Does not leak!!,"I have the 22oz bottle with the plastic ring top and it's great. I read a bunch of reviews that said it leaked no matter how tight it was screwed on, however I found that this was simply not the case. In fact, half the time I can't get it open! It seems like the top gets tighter after I've closed it. The only problem I have found is that it gets really hot in the sun, so you do have to keep it in the shade. Otherwise, great bottle!"
5,Great Alternative,"After the whole nalgine/BPA scare, I ended up recycling 8 or 10 nalgine bottles. As a person who really needs a water bottle with her at all times (especally being pregnant and in the summer). I contemplated buying a Sigg bottle, but the liner scared me. While the Epoxy liner was deemed safe, so was nalgine and I was afraid later on someone may find it unsafe. The Klean Kanteen is by far the best alternative - no weird plastics, no liners, just steel. I know it won't get recalled years down the road. The water doesn't taste funny either."
5,kanteen,I have had my kanteen for about 3 weeks or so and i use it everyday at work. I love it. I use True Lemon/Lime/Orange crystallized packets and add it to my water. the kanteen is easy to use and i love the fact that Im not wasting countless plastic bottles. I will be using this product for a very long time!!
4,Tasty most of the time,"I purchased two of these for my husband and myself. I've been using mine daily for a little over a month. Occasionally, the water will have a metalic taste, usually only if it's been sitting in the container for several hours. The container can get dinged up if you're rough on it, but I didn't really purchase it for it's aesthetic value..."
5,Simple and perfect.,"I love this bottle. Easy to clean, doesn't smell weird. The rounded bottom doesn't rip the mesh pocket of my backpacks. It's just perfect."
5,Always happy with Klean Kanteens!,This is the third Klean Kanteen I've purchased and they're always great. They make water taste better and are super durable.
3,"The 12 oz with sippy cap works for us, the larger bottles don't","KLEAN KANTEEN -- SIZE and INSTABILITY12 ozToo small for meNot enough for a trip to the gymIt does, however, work well for our children's nightstands as long as the ""sippy"" lid is used. Otherwise if they knock it over with the other plastic lid, the bed or floor is soaked.18 oz and 27 ozToo small for me since I drink that in no time flatIt fell over all the time and was completely dented. In KLEAN KANTEEN's defense, we gave up before trying their wide mouth bottles. They look more stable and may have been a good choice but the lids leaking all the time were a hassle so we moved on.KLEAN KANTEEN CAPS -- LEAK ISSUESStainless flat steel caps leakedSport caps over time began to leakSippy caps do not leakPlastic loop cap that screws in only if screwed in really tight didn't leakWith the exception of the 12 oz stainless bottles with sippy caps we switched to Camelbak Eddy bottles."
3,Good product,I bought this for my wife as she was looking for a BPA free bottle. Was nice but the bottom continually became dented.
5,won't leave home without it,"Better than plastic water bottles (they get smellly and dirty within a few days if you're not washing them daily with soap). With the Klean Kanteen i just run it through the dish washer once a week and can just rinse it out other wise. no weird smells, no weird tastes. Great water bottle for people on the go."
2,Water smells bad,"I still use the bottle because I like the idea of not having to buy water in plastic bottles but from day 1 water smells bad in Klean Kanteen! The taste is normal if you hold your nose shut, but the smell is gross. I will do the magnet test like somebody recommended to make sure that it really is stainless steel and not some cheap material used."
3,Leak of water,I recommend this product but the sport cap 2.0 is not ease apply and remove for child (9 years old). There is a leak of water through the valve when the bottle is not vertically.
3,Klean Kanteen w/sport cap 12 oz,"Bottle was too small for our needs, and is not insulated. Only stands about 5 inches tall.Sleek and nice looking. Sport cap seems very functional."
4,Better than plastic,This is a great product. I wish it was made locally though so it could be even morre ec0-friendly.
4,Klean Kanteen,The Klean Kanteen meets my needs. The price was rather steep for a simple stainless container with a plastic cap. I would recommend this product if the buyer doesn't mind paying the price.
2,Leaks,"these bottles (with the sport cap) are great unless they tip over, they leak everywhere. They have a small hole on the top that lets air in, but it also lets water out. I would recommend getting the original top, if you are buying this product."
4,Love it!,Great water bottle. I love that its a local company just wish it hadn't been made in china. I probably wouldn't have bought it if I'd known.
2,highly over rated,"This is highly overprice for what you get. It is not insulated. My wife bought similiar item, thermos, that is insulated at half the price. Works much better.Terrible customer service. Took two weeks to ship 90 miles. Cannot get anyone to answer phone to return item.Just not a quality item for the price."
2,KK Stainless Steel Bottle,"I was thrilled when I saw the ad for the stainless steel water bottle. I ordered one for me and one for my husband. BUT, we both agree it is too heavy, and the Loop Cap does not actually cover the mouthpiece. This is not a sanitary condition as far as we are concerned. These are a bit costly, but I thought in the long run it would be a great item. NOT!!! Betty"
3,Sport Cap 2.0,"Thanks Kanteen for keeping me hydrated while looking eco-chic, but Sport Cap 2.0 is just not working for me. It whistles every time I take a sip. So I went to their FAQ, and their solution is ""to loosen the cap just a tiny bit, just make sure it's still tight enough to keep the bottle from leaking"". Really? Let me tell you this, Too Much Trouble. I have to go through this process everyday, figuring out a perfect position for my cap that is loose enough for the noise but is tight enough so water does not leak. They need to come up with 3.0, and I'll give them 5 stars."
4,Great for everyday use,This Klean Kanteen bottle is a great alternative for those who wants to save money from purchasing water bottles all the time. I used the bottle to refill water with temperatures ranging from cold to warm and the bottle keeps this temperature for long time. I purchased the Klean Kanteen with the Poly Sport Cap because I do sports frequently - The bad side was that water always leaked from this cap whenever I put it in my bag. So in order to keep it from wetting my things I had to carry my backpack and put it upright outside on the sides of my backpack or I have to carry it by hand. This could change if I bought the Poly Loop cap instead. Other than the leaking problem from the cap this bottle is great for everyday use and long-lasting.
4,better than plastic,Excellent design. No plastic taste. I love the sports cap 2.0 even though it does drip if it is on its side. That's the only flaw. Perfect size. Large mouth opening makes it easy to clean and the bottle size makes it easy to take anywhere. I would recommend this product. Its tough and can take a beating. Can't wait to get the bike cage for my Mtn bike and take my Kanteen on some trails.
4,Good water bottle,I bought this bottle due to the health concerns of using plastic. I use it at work and at the gym. I drink form the bottle while running and the mouth of the bottle is so large that it splashes a bit. I am considering getting the sports cap for this reason. All and all I am happy with the product.
5,Love this bottle!,"I have bought a number of Klean Kanteens and they are the best-keep drinks cold, love the loop top and no funny smell or taste to water."
3,Ok for now but could use some improvements!,"I bought this bottle to keep in my car and office. Basically it is traveling with me wherever I go right now. Overall I'm ok with this bottle but there's definitely room for improvement.Here's my list:Pros:Made of steel - so durable - although it does get scratches.Fits in the cup-holder of my car.Cons:The last bit of water has a metallic smell to it.Sweats.Would have preferred a sports cap with it. The existing cap makes noise while opening and sometimes its difficult to open.I am making do with this one for myself, but for my husband who wants a bottle to carry along to the gym, I won't buy it."
3,good bottle but the mouth section is hard to clean,"The bottle is good in general but the mouth section which you put your mouth to drink, has a little bend which is hard to clean."
4,Worthwhile,We have used our Klean Kanteen water bottles for several weeks now and have found them to be a very worthwhile investment. The water tastes fresh and remains cool. The only problem is that one of the stoppers fits so tightly that it requires quite an exertion to open it. I just make certain that my wife always uses a bottle that has an easy-to-open stopper.
3,Okay but not great,"We bought two stainless steel water bottles. On the plus side, there is no tinny taste and I am no longer worried about whether I am ingesting plastic. The metal sweats in hot weather, which should have been no surprise, but more interestingly, the top goes on easily on one of the bottles and a little bit of a struggle with the other."
5,Greatest bottles ever!,These bottles allow you to drink clean fresh tasting water and refill where ever you are. The different tops help me whether I'm taking to gym and want the loop for my keys or putting in my pocketbook so just want a tight close. I do wish there was a wrap that would better help it stay cold.And as always found good prices on Amazon but not all of the accessories. kleankanteen.com
3,Cap cover very difficult to remove,"This bottle is a great size for small kids. Unfortunately, even I found it difficult to remove the cap cover. In the end, I decided to take the cover off - just hope my four year old remembers to push down the sports cap properly!"
2,Disappointing!,"I don't care for this water bottle at all. The water gets warm shortly after you put it in, I wish they made a double walled water bottle like the thermos ones my kids have. The sports cap is also the kind you have to basically suck on to get the water out, this is no good when you're on the treadmill and need a quick drink. To top it off, every time I throw it in my bag it leaks all over. What a disappointment! The only plus is that the water tastes good, I've never had a problem with metallic tasting water, just warm..."
3,"Pleased, but still have one concern","I was so excited to get this product. I ordered 3 different sizes. Overall, I am pleased but have one complaint. The advent lid/canteen leaks all the time. I know it is better for my son to drink out of than a plastic sippy cup, but his drink is spilling everywhere."
1,Sippy lid leaks all the time,"the sippy leaks....every time...thru the air hole, not the nipple. not the fault of the bottle but the poor design of the Advent adaptor. Leaks due to pressure in the bottle caused by sucking forcing the liquid out. Klean did not want to help, gave me the brush-off."
2,Tastes terrible!!!,"These bottles seem pretty sturdy, are decently stylish, and come in the right size, but when you go to take a drink all you smell and taste is metal!! It really tastes like a pocketful of change in your mouth and the smeel is unbearable. I had to give them back to Amazon and I ordered a Sigg bottle instead. Hope it works out..."
4,Good but needs some design improvement,"The bottle is of excellent quality. However, it's designed so that the brim is not covered (notice the cap,) so it can get dirty if it falls to the ground or if one touches it with dirty hands."
2,The bottle of the thousand screaming dolphins,"Yeah... So. Beautiful bottle. Nice weight. Like the loop on the top for attaching it to something. Good size.The only problem is that, when you drink out of it, the air vent makes a noise like a thousand screaming dolphins. This is NOT ideal if you are in a position where you must consume liquid in the presence of any other human being within earshot."
1,Leaks & squeaks,The sport caps (2.0 and 3.0) both leak when closed and squeak when you drink from them. The vent valve acts like a reed and chirps like a bird. No good at work or class. Made in China too! This is the best available bottle? Wow.
2,Ordered and Returned,"I bought and then returned this product.The bottle itself seemed fine. However, it did not fit in my car's cup holders. Also, the poly cap made a lot of loud squealing/squeaking as it was screwed in or out.Those were the only downsides I found."
5,Love it!,I like this brand better then the sigg bottles because of its wide opening which makes the bottle easier to clean. I also like the size of the bottle - something I can easily put in my purse and carry around. Great product!
4,Klean Kanteen,"Item arrived very promptly and was exactly what I ordered. The only issue with the product is when there is no liquid in the kanteen, when twisting the lid on or off it makes a very loud squeaky noise- HOWEVER- when liquids are present this noise goes away."
4,Huge money saver,"This bottle keeps the beverage cold for a long time. It is a huge money saver and is very convenient. The best feature is the wide neck, making it easy to put ice cubes inside. Highly recommend this product."
3,"Not bad, but not great either.","For the money, I would have liked a product that does not ""sweat"" when the contents are cold. Some condensation is to be expected, but with the stainless steel, it is profuse. I have to let the bottle sit until it gets closer to room temperature and then wipe it down - several times. This is not convenient if I want to use it on the go. I also wish it was easier to drink from. It is difficult to hold in the little button to release the air while drinking. It is not entirely necessary to do so, but the squeaking noise it makes if you do not can be a problem in public. I decided not to return the bottles I ordered, but I would not order them again."
5,A Great Watter Bottle,"The title says it all. This is a great all around water bottle. It's sleek, stylish and most importantly holds your water!"
5,Kleen Kanteen 27 fl oz,"Very clean taste to the water, especially when cold. This bottle has definitely been my favorite bottle of sigg, nalgene or any other types out there."
4,NICE,"I brought the 1L one for my boyfriend,nice colour,nice size..but it arrived scratched and marred, maybe not well packed...anyway,,,it's nice for the discounted price.."
5,fantastic bottle,"I bought two Kleen Kanteens..different sizes. They are one of the best investments I have made in both the health of my body (no more plastics, ugh) and in sustainability for the earth. These bottles will be with me forever. Don't let the ""plastic"" lid discourage you; It is rather necessary and does not create a problem. I have had no problems with tightness in the lid, as others have reported. This really is a fantastic bottle..."
4,Water bottle,I really like this water bottle. It is a nice sturdy stainless steel bottle that is available in fun colors. I ordered 2 lids so that I can wash one and use the other. Only one small problem. The bottle often squeeks or whistles when you drink out of it. It is not real loud but it does make some funny sounds if you work in a quiet office.
5,Great for Lunch Boxes,Bought this for my daughter. Was tired of cleaning the plastic caps of the Sigg Bottles. This one is MUCH easier to clean and dishwasher safe! Perfect size for a lunchbox
4,Great Bottle,"I really prefer the wide mouth stainless steel over plastic bottles. easy to use, light, and absolutely no taste. It does get hot a bit faster than plastic if you have chilled water in the bottle. The Kleen Kanteen brand is high quality, though a bit spendy: you are paying for brand buzz. I also own a $4 version I bought in Rite-Aid on vacation and can't really tell much difference. I also own a HydroFlask (from Bend, Oregon) insulated stainless, which is much better but also much more expensive. it keeps liquids cold all day and is very light, but $28..."
3,It's okay,"I like the fact that the water bottle holds 40oz but other than that its just okay. The bottle sweats, it doesn't keep the water cold for very long and it doesn't fit in my car's cupholder. It also makes a weird sound when you drink from it, like a slurping, whistling noise."
3,ok water bottle but it leaks,"This is not the bottle to buy if your child isn't over 3. My 2 year old can drink out of pretty much anything now, but this one leaks all over the place if it isn't closed. Even when it is closed, it leaks. It does say it isn't leak free, but I expected a little more from this brand. She doesn't want to drink from it so it was a waste of money. Hopefully when she's older she'll use it."
2,metal taste and amount of liquid,"I ordered 3 of the 12oz size. I thought that it would actually hold 12oz, but it barely holds 8oz. I wanted to use if for my kids as well as a workout water bottle. It seems to have a distintive metal taste that is unpleasant for me. Maybe it is me, but I am not pleased and will return. If anyone has advice, I am all ears! The low rating is based on that only. It is made well and seems durable."
2,It's for the greater good,"Klean Kanteen is a good idea...however, I'll most likely order another cap. the sports cap is a good concept for a bottle that you can squeeze, but you can;'t squeeze stainless ;) we like the idea of not filling the landfill with bottles when these are available"
3,Made in China,"After a very exhaustive research, I found that this product was made in China to ""keep the prices low"". Unfortunately, most items today are made in China and other countries where the people have no say in how they live.What's also interesting about products from China is that there is no difference between knockoffs and the real thing. China has no problem with using the same manufacturer's label and selling it on the market to anyone. So, yeah. if you find one of these for a cheap price, it's probably a knockoff, but its made by the same process.This product is fine, except for the narrow neck at the top making it hard to clean the bottle thoroughly. There are other alternatives that in my opinion are better, it just requires a little research."
2,defective sports cap,"I may change this review if the company pays forward and replaces my cap. I bought 3 bottles 2 of them with sports caps (12 oz size) for my kids to take to school. One of the sports caps leaks from the mouth piece. The one that doesnt leak you can see that the inside piece comes above the outside, the one that does leak however isnt the same. The inside part is at the same level as the other, if that makes sense. Anyway I went to their site and found that they do not guarantee that the sport cap will not leak. Apparently it is not designed that way. So all the children will just have to suffer from soggy sandwiches and damaged textbooks. That's ingenuity and quality we expect from a $15 bottle!"
2,Metallic taste,"I read the reviews before buying this water bottle, and had high hopes for it. Unfortunately, even after repeated washing (hand washed with mild soap), water in this bottle has a metallic taste. I gave it two stars because I love the design, but as it makes water taste metallic, I did return the water bottle. Amazon is great and makes returns so easy! But I wish I had a usable water bottle instead..."
1,It's Not Easy Being Green...,"I bought the Klean Kanteen because I wanted to drink my daily water, and still feel environmentally sound. I bought this product, put my water in it, and took it to work. Unfortunately, the Kleen Kanteen makes my water taste like metal, and is barely drinkable. I do not recommend this product -- unless you like the taste of metal in your water!"
1,"PBA-free yes, leak-proof definitely not!",I cannot believe the fact that this bottle is not leak proof. I bought it with sport cap 2.0 and it leaks.Unbelievable! I would not recommend this product and will go back to SIGG.
3,Somewhat disappointed...,This water bottle is great if your only concern is being green. I am somewhat disappointed that it is not insulated and it sweats when ice cold water is placed in it. Water does not stay cold very long on hot days.
3,kanteen,the inside of this container smells like death in a can. I probably wouldn't drink from it but it was a gift requested by a friend so it's all his.
2,Not Insulated!,It may have been said in the description - but I missed it. This bottle is not insulated. Its more a gym bottle. It makes a whistling sound when drinking from the nozzle and sweated all over my desk. Definately a gym bottle.
3,good canteen,"This was a worthwhile product. I'm only worried that it will be lost or stolen. Plastic bottles are cheap, steel isn't."
2,Disappointing,"I bought the smallest bottle to use at the gym or after yoga or just to tote around in the car. The looks and construction are fine, but this bottle is very tough to drink from. The opening is an awkward size, making it virtually impossible to avoid dribbling water all over yourself."
1,Great Product - Seller is overpriced,"Shame on me for not checking the price. I ordered 2 others at the same time and ""assumed"" the prices were all the same. Well, we know how that one's going to end. Double the price for the same thing. Unbelievable!!!!Buyer Beware."
4,Great!,"Love the bottle, would have gave five starts but the pressure release valve in the sport cap can be very noisy while drinking. I sill recomend it though."
2,Would never purchase again!,Not a good quality product at all - it leaks a lot and makes a weird whooshing sound when I drink from it. Would def not recommend it.
1,It leaks,I don't like to use plastic bottles for my children so I gave it try on this product but... it leaks from the sport cap. and it sweats a lot when I put cold drink inside.
4,Great Bottle....Excellent Quality,Just got the Klean Kanteen Stainless 27oz bottle.I must say the bottle in nicely made. Pretty sturdy and will stand up to everday use.The opening is large enough if you want to put some ice cubes in and allow a brush inside to clean.
4,worth the $$,This water bottle is really great for the price. The only complaint I have is that the water begins to have a slight metal taste if it's been in the bottle for a few hours. But I guess that just encourages me to drink faster!
3,sports cap not leakproof,"Very cool bottles and great colors. I bought several for Christmas gifts, but returned them after I read the packaging on a sports cap that I bought separately. It states that sports caps are not leakproof. I would recommend getting them if you just want regular cap."
2,Not as cool as it looks,"I thought this would be a great addition to my workout routine and general efforts to stay better hydrated. Not necessarily so. First, when you add cold water, the outside of the container is just as cold -- not great when the weather outside is already cold. The metal surface also doesn't help when the weather is cold -- brrr. Need some sort of cozy to hold onto it. When drinking while exercising, you have to hold the bottle just right or the handle will poke you in the face. Heaven forbid you get really thirsty while you are less than focused on what you are reaching for and how you are holding the bottle. Finally, the cap has to be on the bottle to come close to a watertight seal -- which it's not. Definitely not a one-handed hydration option for exercisers! Not bad, but certainly not what I anticipated!"
4,klean kanteen 27 oz w sport cap,great bottle but cap appears to leak from top of spout even when pushed all of the way down if tipped over. I like the stainless cap on my other bottle.
2,Just Okay,"I've had this bottle for about a year now. It keep beverages cold for a good while (although it's very sweaty). The only thing I don't like is that the paint chipped easily and quickly without heavy use. Also at times there's a slight metallic taste. For BPA, metal free portable beverage, you're better off getting a glass bottle like the LifeFactory bottles with silicone covers or a BPA free plastic bottle with filters like the Seychelle bottles. I have no idea why there are so many good reviews on this site for these bottles."
5,klean kanteen,"I ordered 2 Kanteens, 1 27 oz and the other one is smaller and pink. I love this product. It is clean, economical, and green.My kanteen goes to the movies with me, and anywhere else I will be and only want my own (not tap) water. This was noteasy for me to find anywhere, until I checked amazon.com.Thank you, now no more styrofoam cups, no plastic bottles, and I know I am helping the planet"
5,Perfect!,"I originally just wanted theKlean Kanteen Poly Sports 2.0 Cap, but was sold on the color and size of the whole ensamble.Typically this is where you would see a pros headers, but I have no cons, so a header is not needed. But bulleted list!* Bright color, not going to get lost easily. Matches my MacBook's shell and my backpack.* Amazing Kleen Kanteen construction, super durable, super light.* No weird taste, well there is a subtle but refreshing taste, likely me tasting clean water from a clean water bottle for the first time.* Great cap, it's not like those straw like ones where you just drink up, but not like a classic sports top. It requires a bit of suction, while at an angle, but not so much that your mouth dries out. And it won't leak if you invert it. Note it will feel weird to drink and not squeeze but you will get used to it!I'll update in three months with more info. And always if needed.That's all folks!"
3,"Like it, but...","I love the quality and color of this 27 ounce Classic Loop Cap Kanteen. However, It is very annoying how the rim of the mouth piece touches my nose when I drink from it. I would probably purchase the wide mouth option next time. Unfortunately, it doesn't come in my favorite color, or the 27oz."
2,Not leakproof,"This is a sturdy and durable bottle, but it leaks through the cap (I bought the polysports cap), which is a big inconvenience. I would not buy again."
4,Klean Kanteen - great alternative to plastic water bottles,I think this product is a really good option to help the environment. I did buy the sports cap and since you can't squeeze the bottle you end up sucking the water out - it is a little hard to get used to but you do.
5,12 oz bottle is perfect for lunchbox,"I am very happy with the size of this 12 oz bottle. It fits in my son's lunchbox and he can open the poptop cap & sports cap on his own, which is important at school lunch."
2,Not the best,"Klean Kanteen makes water tastes metallic to me (like coins, as someone else put it) and the metal clinks against my teeth, which is like nails on a blackboard. It's not very insulating, either; cold water=cold bottle.I was *much* happier with my SIGG bottle. The water is flavorless, thanks to the lining, and it's better insulated. The shape keeps the metal away from your teeth, and the sport top is really innovative and keeps accidental spills to a minimum. It's not noticeably heavier than Klean Kanteen, and it's much nicer to hold."
3,A little leaky...,"I was a little disappointed that the 12-oz. sippy leaks a bit. It is however, much less leaky than the Foogo by Thermos. I like the components of the Kleen Kanteen container itself (the safety aspects of it, the ease of cleaning it), but my 15 month-old could never use it on a carpeted area until she's old enough to resist flinging it around the room and off the high chair:("
1,I hate the steel smell!,"Everytime I open the cap, there is a strong steel smell coming up! It's so digusting, it even blends with the water. In winter, this bottle can't hold any warmth. The hot water will just conduct through the steel. And the bottle, after using it for two days. It become so dirty, I don't know why, it's just getting sticky. When drinking, water does overflows The mouth is just too big to suit ours!! So when I go outdoor, it's not easily carribale and drinking!For anyone of you, I don't recommend this bottle. It does NOT worth 20 bucks at all!!!! You can just get a 5 dollars transparent plastic bottle that's definitely better than this one!"
2,18oz klean kanteen,"I purchased the 18oz klean kanteen , the 27 oz. and the 40 oz. The reason i purchased the 18 oz. was so it could fit in my bicycle water bottle cage. It does fit, but so does the 27 oz., which really makes the 18 oz. irrelevant for me. The sport cap works well for drinking, but the clean cap lanyard that comes with the sports cap is not practical, and awkward. Would recommend the 27 oz. and the 40oz."
5,Great purchase!,"I've been using Nalgene bottles for years and decided to switch after reading up on health concerns and plastic containers. This has been exceptional. I will be purchasing more of these, but will probably buy the loop top."
5,Motomo,"I just received this water bottle as a gift and it is fabulous! My favorite water bottle by far. It is lightweight, easy to drink out of, and can be clipped to my backpack or anywhere else (I have the sport poly loop cap). I am getting a few more for other family members. I highly recommend this water bottle."
3,not that great,I've had three Klean Kanteens for about 1 year now and almost all the paint has chipped or peeled off. The water tasted fresh at first but now it gets a metal taste. Would not buy again.
4,Whistles,"The shape and quality of the bottle is fabulous. However, the sports cap whistles when I drink out of it. I wrote Klean Kanteen to see if I received a defective cap. It is the holiday season, so I wouldn't expect to receive an answer for a couple of days. I do think their response to me will be more than acceptable since they were very helpful when I asked product questions prior to ordering. They are a respectable family company."
5,"Good quality, Good Seal, No Taste","I am impressed with the quality of these bottles and don't have any complaints. The only strange thing is that when the fluid level is just right, and you tip the bottle down too fast, the fluid tends to splash back at you. This is with the 27oz model."
4,perfect for a student!,Full time student. Convenient and rugged water bottle. 40oz is more than enough for hydration for about 8 hours. Stainless steel makes it easy to clean. Only complaint is that it does not fit in cup holdersdefinitely will buy again
1,Leaks,I bought the 18 ounce bottle after buying a similar bottle at school. My wife used it one time and it leaked all over the place. I would normally return the item but I threw the packaging out before I realized we got a defective item. I am going to try again hoping this was just an anomaly.
3,Klean Kanteen serves the purpose,"These water bottles work as any other water bottle to provide clean, wholesome, filtered water without the worry of chemicals leaching into the water from plastic. However, I ordered the sports tops because I like the convenience, especially in the car, and the water makes a squeaky noise coming out as the air goes in which is not appropriate in many settings. Also I ordered the 20 oz and find it is not big enough. I was worried the 40 oz w3ould be to big to fit the cup holders in the car. I find the water does not stay cold as long in the metal container as in plastic, but that is a tradeoff for the health benefits. The metal container also sweats more than plastic. Overall, while the bottles have some downsides, I will keep using them and they are a convenient way of getting the ""healthy"" filtered water I want."
3,Klean Kanteen Water Bottle,"I have been looking for water bottle for a long time. I bought Klean Kanteen for about a month now. It's okay, but still not what I expected. I use my water bottle every day- at work and during my training. Sometimes water smells and tastes little weird after few hours. I also wish there were different caps available. This one is little hard to open and if I use it frequently- for example when I work out- I have to leave it opened. Otherwise it takes me more time to open it and close it each time I want to take a sip. I will be looking for different water bottle soon."
2,"Love the bottle, shame they didnt get the order right","Love Klean Kanteens, for the open mouths which work in a dishwasher, the bright colors that kids love, that they don't make the water taste metallic, and the different sizes available. So much to love!Annoyed about not getting what I ordered. The lid was wrong and the sports lid leaks.So now I have the choice of returning the whole thing because the lid is wrong, which seems a waste of postage and effort, or going somewhere else to buy the right lid for another $4 or whatever it is.Not much money, but annoying. Maybe use a different supplier?"
2,Undrinkable: Like Drinking From A Rusty Water Fountain,"I have cleaned the bottle at least a dozen times with warm water and mild soap. I took the manufacturer's suggestion and cleaned it with baking soda and vinegar. I took their additional suggestion of letting distilled water and vinegar sit in the bottle over night. I tried everything and still, the water is disgusting. I use double-filtered water in the bottle and I liken it to the water that you would taste from a rusty old drinking fountain in a run-down park. If the water tastes like metal, it's probably not very good for your health."
4,KK great for bike touring,"Bought the 800ml black version (matches the colour of my bike) and also a spare 800ml stainless steel version with matching bottle cages, for cycle touring - have scraped the black one a lot taking it in and out of bike bottle cage, so should probably have stuck with 2 x stainless steel.That said - the Kleen Kanteen is so much nicer to drink from than what I had used previously.Wish there was a 1.5 litre version of this product - had forgotten to bring along a spare 1.5 ltr bottle and ran out of water last weekend in the middle of no where..."
3,Great Water Bottle Except...,"I really do like this bottle. It fits well in my hand and even when it is full I can loop my finger through the top and carry it for long distances without it hurting me. It keeps my water cold for a long period of time and I really like the dust cap; however, I didn't realize that the bottle would ""breathe"" when I drank from it. It makes this high pitched squeaky noise like a seal barking really fast. This isn't a problem in a workout class or when I am out running on my own but when I am sitting in class or a meeting it is embarrassing to drink from. This is honestly enough of a deal breaker for me that I would send it back if I could but since I don't want to pay the $6 return shipping fee that Amazon charges... I will just keep it and try to sip quietly!"
3,Klean Kanteen,40 oz. bottles are a bit too large in diameter. Hard to hold. Rubber grip around or smaller diameter would improve. Wanted the volume but didn't know the container dimensions when we ordered.
1,Poor Quality - Metallic Taste in Water,"I was expecting a much better product. Although it met my needs regarding size and environmental impact, it is made of poor stainless steel material (another poorly made product from China). After a couple of uses, the water has a metallic taste. No telling what it is I am really drinking as there is no way of knowing what is leaching into my water. I will be recycling this! Very disappointed and I will be using a glass from now on. I cannot recommend this product at all."
1,returning product- taste issue,"We purchased 6 bottles- 2 large bottles and 4 small ones. There is a metallic ""feel"" to the liquid when drinking the water (like touching a tooth filling with a fork or aluminum foil) and some of the screw lids introduce a rubber/silicone taste and smell. We are returning them all."
5,Great Waterbottles,"We have 8 of these bottles. Two for Mom and Dad...two for our kids ages 2 and 4. They are indestructable, you can scrub the insides and not worry of scratching and they do not leach anything into your beverage."
1,colored klean kanteen,"Save your money on the Klean Kanteens with color. Buy the stainless steel ones. The product itself is quite fine, but the colored ones arrive scratched and marred, so I think it will just be a matter of time before they do that anyway. Amazon did replace the marred ones, but I wish I had purchased the stainless steel ones."
3,Stick to the original stainless with no color...,"I loved the original stainless version. I needed another bottle and when I saw that Kleen had come out with the ""pretty"" colored versions I decided to get one of those. Sadly, after only 3-4 weeks of use, my paint is all scratched and chipped. I also must have leaned it up against a magazine when it was sweating because it now has the permanent odd colored stains around it as well. I haven't had this problem with my regular old stainless version.Bottomline I love the bottle. My water tastes great and I am not worried about BPA. Something just went awry when they decided to paint it!"
2,Wish I could give it a better review,"Pros: It feels good in the hand. Very easy to clean. No liner, so no worries about what the liner is made of, or whether the liner will wear out.Cons: It leaks even when the cap is screwed on tight. This is a deal breaker. Also, its mouth is poorly shaped for drinking. If you're moving, as in a car or on a cardio trainer, it is all too easy to spill water all over your chest while trying to get it in your mouth."
5,Suck & Squeek-Squeek,"The bottle gets very cold or warm depending on the beverage. If that bothers you, I'd suggest getting a sleeve as other have.The sports top is great, but it is a little difficult to get the water out and it will make an odd noise as air returns to the bottle while it is full.When you take the cap off, the top opens as well so you don't have to touch the bottle top to open it (or close it if you use the cap). This seems like a much cleaner way of enjoying your water.If you are going to use these on a bicycle with a bottle cage, note that the bottle will get scratched up if your cage is aluminum or any other type of metal.The Logo and words on the bottle also scrape off easily. I wouldn't buy this if that is going to be a problem for you.Water does not taste ""metallic,"" even when left in the bottle over night in the fridge."
4,Great for traveling throughout the day,"I ordered the 18ox black kanteen and have been very pleased with it so far. It fits perfectly in my car's cup holder and is lightweight enough to throw in my purse. I really like the size because I can keep it at my desk at work and refill, then bring it with me as I travel and run errands throughout the day. The only negative is that it doesn't really keep cold beverages cold for very long. That's about it, I like it so far!"
4,You need the sports top,The top of the Klean Kanteen is very wide so when you drink from it you will probably spill. I recommend ordering the sports top with it. I think it should come with the sports top and not be an extra charge.
2,Paint is peeling,"I purchased two Klean Kanteens, one Pink and one Black. My husband used the Black Kanteen three times, loved it, but found out the paint on the bottom (outside) of the canteen is starting to peel! [...]"
5,The Klean Kanteen is great!,"We originally purchased two Klean Kanteens for ourselves to stop using the plastic bottles. The water tastes great. Our friends saw us using them and wanted one too, so we purchased more to give as gifts."
5,Great,"Bought this after I had purchased 2 for my Wife and Son. It works great around the house and for car trips. I like that it has a large mouth so ice can be put in it. Also, the sports cap, although noisy, makes it easy to drink from and pretty much spill proof."
4,Use Vinegar,"I bought the 40oz version in green. two things: 1) Green is a little darker than it looks on the computer, but, that could just be my monitor too. Just be aware of that fact. 2) The bottle seems to give a ""taste"" to my water. After searching and searching, it seems more that it has a smell rather than a taste. Turns out, you should soak the bottle in a 50/50 water/vinegar solution over night or so. This sounds weird but it helps out a lot with the smell. Other than that, the bottle has been great. It does leak if laid on it side, especially when half-full. If you really crank on the top, it seems to help. Definitely feels like something that will last for a while which is good."
5,Great Bottle,"What can I say about it other than it's a great bottle. Strong construction and clean taste. I do wish they had another size inbetween the 40 ounce and 27 ounce bottles. The 40oz bottle can sometimes be too big and the 27oz can sometimes be too small. Overall, great Earth bottles. We have four altogether."
3,Kanteen,I was a bit disappointed. I like the look and the 18 oz size and I like the cap but there is an after taste with water. I haven't tried other drinks in it.
3,"Good water bottle, annoying sound",As water bottles go this one is pretty good but the sports cap makes an annoying whistling sound through the pressure valve when you drink from it. I'm not sure if this is a defect in the one I have or if they are all like that.
3,Rusted on arrival,"I was looking forward to getting my new Klean Kanteens, from Amazon. I have a few other stainless steel bottles, and these are supposed to be the best. When the box arrived, they were not individually packaged, I ordered two. I would be ok with this, but I could hear them banging around in the box. When I opened the box, both had large amounts of rust on the outside. The inside was fine. I thought stainless steel would not or at least resist rust. I used a green scrubbing pad to remove the rust and then soap and water to finish the clean up. They look fine now but I didn't expect the extra work when they arrived."
2,Allergic Reaction!,"I recently bought four of these for my family for Christmas, so we could stop using the plastic bottles. After drinking from the 40oz. steel loop cap bottle I had an allergic reaction where the bottle comes into contact with my mouth. I researched their website to realize there is Nickel in the steel, of which I am allergic. I just wanted to make others aware of the potential allergy. I only have had an issue with jewelry before and didn't think twice about drinking from a metal bottle. The rest of my family has had no reaction and they love their bottles!"
1,Made in China...no wonder it's so cheap!,"This bottle is made in China. Their website claims that it is impossible to source the manufacturing ""closer to home."" That's baloney. SIGG has a subsidiary in the US...which is why it is worth the extra price."
2,"Klean Kanteen Stainless Steel 40 Ounce Water Bottle with 2.0 Sports Cap, Indicator Red","I really like it; except one-huge problem (if I would have known, ahead of time, I would never would have purchased this product from 'Klean Kanteen') and one-small problem.Klean Kanteen does not use USA materials and workers, comes from South Korea,My bicycle's bottle holder does not hold shuck wide bottles, though the Simple solution is to purchase a new bottle holder."
2,KLEAN kANTEEN NOT AS I HAD THOUGHT,"iT IS A STURDY PRODUCT. There is a little air valve that when you drink from the kanteen, it makes a noise. Very aggravating.It does not keep water cold at all.It is good in that you do no have to replace it just keep it clean.Linda Walmer"
5,A great product with a reasonable price,So far I only have been using it for my morning smoothie and like it. I am sure I can use it for some other things.
3,The 27 oz unpainted version is good,I do not recommend painted version or the 40 oz version. The larger ones dent WAY too easily and the paint chips off if you look at it too hard. You also cannot drink from the sport top without making tons of noise through the breather and that is annoying. The taste of water out of these is completely untouched though and that is why I like these.
1,Damaged/ leaking,I HATE TO WRITE NEGATIVE REVIEWS BUT THIS PRODUCT IS LEAKING. MY SON WAS COMPLAINING THAT HIS BACKPACK IS WET SO I CHECKED IT AND THERE WAS A TINY WHOLE. I HOPE I DON'T HAVE PROBLEM TO RETURN IT.
4,Not a bad product,"I've had it for over a year now... It's nice, but it dents really easily. I dropped it on the floor once and the bottom of it dented badly. I had to have my parents clamp it and beat the bottom back down so it wouldn't wobble anymore. Now there's no more paint on the bottom. It still works, though."
3,kleenkantine,great size for holding a lot of water. spout doesn't fit under theice cube machine spout. love not having plastic around. i bought severalsizes of these. the smaller one is too narrow and may fall over easily.the largest size has a nice steel lid but the smaller sizes all have plastic screw in lids which i wanted to avoid. smells a bit like steel but that is infinitely better than the smell of warm plastic.
4,"Nice looking, funny taste",I love this water bottle but am having a hard time getting used to the slight metallic taste. I do prefer it to water bottles though and will continue to use it.
5,Very fine craftsmanship,"The Klean Kanteen Stainless Steel Water Bottle has very good quality and reliability. The body material is carefully manufactured, the outer paint is very finely coated. The top cap is in very good quality too. I might put the bottle in the closet as a decorative item rather to use it. Of course the fair quality can endure large use wears and could be your lifetime friend."
1,Way downhill,"This is not my first Klean Kanteen but it is likely my last. Their quality control has gone way downhill, and there are cracks for mold to grow in or something. Unlike my old (better made) bottle, this one starts smelling badly after being filled for a day. I've tried soap, vinegar, alcohol, boiling, and even (in my desperation) freezing one bottle despite the warnings. Nothing helps."
5,Perfect sports bottle for kids and adults alike,"In our family we each have a Kleen Kanteen in different colors, so we have 6 of them total. Obviously I have been very pleased with this product!"
2,cap problems,"The standard cap needs to be screwed down so tight that it can be hard to remove. I keep a carabiner on the loop to get extra leverage when unscrewing. The sport cap is leak-prone: if the bottle falls over it will leak, and in the worst case may come completely undone and spill water."
4,Nice upgrade,"Purchased to replace my old nalgene bottle. Wanted to minimize the amount of plastic in my drinking container so the klean kanteen seemed the logical upgrade. Decided to opt for the 40 oz. based on the similar size of my previous water bottle. Kanteen is somewhat cumbersome but is understandable given the volume. Unfortunately, due to the stainless steel the kanteen is easily dented and the paint chips easily. In addition due to the design of the bottle the vacuum elimination port makes a slight whistling noise. Finally, you must make certain that the spout is completely closed as leaking is somewhat of an issue.Overall the negatives are minimal and I have really enjoyed the kanteen thus far. Currently I have been converted from a nalgene user to an klean kanteen user and would highly recommend this product."
4,Klean Kanteen is definitely more environmentally friendly and lasts longer,"I really liked my PBA free plastic water bottles but was disappointed in their life span. Klean Kanteen is much nicer. The water tastes cleaner, the bottle is easier to clean and ""know"" if it is clean and I love that there is no plastic at all in the canteen. However, I don't know about the contents of the lids...I'm hoping they are at least PBA free but it was hard to find out if that was the case. Also, I ""need"" the sports lids and the little air hole is a real pain. If you leave the stopper in, it whistles when you drink, which for me is an actual medical problem due to hyper sensory and balance issues. If you take out the stopper, it leaks when you drink. My solution is to just put my finger over the stopper when I drink. That seems to take care of the problem but, it's challenging to always remember to do it. I would love it if it just didn't whistle. My husband and I use the Klean Kanteen 24/7. We love them!~"
2,Delicate cap,"The kanteen itself is really nice, but the loop broke off the stainless cap the first time it took a bump. I'll try the all plastic cap and see if it is more durable because I do like the canteen."
2,Clean but not tasty,"We purchased the Kleen Canteen Steel Loop Cap bottle in the 18 and 24oz sizes. I put filtered water into the larger bottle and was very surprised that after an over night stay in the frig, the water had a very harsh, metallic taste. After repeating the process, the water still had a metallic flavor. I'm disappointed that this product - which has other features we like such as its construction and close fit of the top - fails to give a Klean taste. We paid a premium price for this product; we won't be purchasing them again."
2,Color is TERRIBLE! Nothing like picture!,"I ordered this as a gift and will definitely be exchanging/returning it!!I ordered the ""Green Energy"" color which looks bright and vivid in the picture online...The water bottle I received looks NOTHING like the color shown in the picture! Instead it is an very ugly, very pale shade of green that I would be embarrassed to use let alone give as a gift! yuck!What a huge disappointment!"
2,Paint is peeling,"If you buy this bottle, buy it as the silver stainless steel, NOT the painted colors. The colors are pretty, but they peel off. I have two blue-painted bottles and one the paint is 1/8 gone and the other the paint is chipping on the bottom. I called KK and the lady informed me that HER bottle has been used for years and doesn't chip at all. I told her I hand-washed them and had them in a stroller cup holder--that's it! No sympathy. Anyway, now I put them in the dishwasher hoping the rest of the paint comes off.The bottle is good for traveling, but the twist top is a bugger to get on and off. Plus I have to use a washcloth over the bottom in our car's cup holders because I'm afraid the chipping paint will stain something. I am hoping to find something else soon."
2,Paint peels off,"After using this bottle for merely a week, and only hand-washing it with cold water just as the manufacturer instructed, its bottom paint started to peel off. I returned the bottle, and Amazon issued me a refund without a problem. I must say, I'm very pleased with Amazon's customer service and return policy."
1,"paint chips quickly, save your $","Save your $, and buy the plain stainless. Paint chipped almost immediately under NORMAL usage. I contacted KK directly, and would not offer refund, gave me a song and dance. Buy Sigg!"
1,great design poor quality for the money,"It says that you can put those bottles in the dishwasher. I bought two and put only one of them in the dishwasher; its enamel is chipping and so is the enamel on the other bottle that has not been in the dishwasher.The cap leaks after two weeks of use.Great design, practical size (12 oz) to give a kid to school, but poor quality and expensive at that."
1,Klean Kanteen,I have the smallest Kanteen and plan to return it. Very difficult to open or close--the ridges are very poorly cut. Not a good value. Irritating to not have immediate information on returns.
4,"great bottle, sports cap a meh","i got the 27-oz in red, with a sports cap. love the design of the bottle & red color, but not so much the cap. it makes a weird slurping noise when you drink, so i end up taking the entire cap off. a bit of a hassle, so i hope they fix this soon!"
4,Klean Kanteen,I purchased several Sigg's but either it was too big to tote around at the gym or I couldn't get the sports top to work right. Weirdest top I've ever used. Therefore I ordered the 18oz Klean with sports top and it is perfect. Small to drag all over the gym and a very simple top. Only complaint is that the sports top is not as free flow as I would like. You have to work a little to get the water out....but they may not be a bad thing. Keeps water cold - easy to clean and small enough to handle. Good product.
3,"The sippy cup leaks, but the adult bottles are great...","I bought the child's sippy cup because I'm concerned about BPA from plastic products leaking into the fluids we give him. So I thought this product was the perfect solution. While I like that it's aluminum and safer for my son, I HATE that it leaks! And that's not fun when he's drinking milk! The company gives you Avent spouts to use with the kanteen and the fit isn't super tight in one spot so that's where the liquid leaks out. It's frustrating.The adult water bottles are awesome."
2,It sweats too much,"It is a nice bottle,and very colorful but the bottle sweats too much if you put cold drinks or ice in it. I do not recommend this product."
2,disappointed,"Unfortunately, the manufacturer sells a good product and then adds the ""Poly Sport Cap"" which leaks under most circumstances and gurgles and whistles whenever one drinks! The cap is so faulty that it damages the overall reputation and experience of using a generally well-designed bottle. Would never recommend the sport cap."
3,"Great brand, neat idea, okay product.","I bought my KK and with the sports cap which leaked in my bag while my Iphone was inside, then I got the stainless cap which broke and got stuck in the bottle, so then I got the plastic loop, which works pretty good, but will leak if turned up side down in your bag. Then the paint is always coming off, which really sucks. It's covered in scratches and chips to the metal and I barely take it out of my bag, except to take a drink. It was very sleek looking upon buying. 6 months later it looks too beat up for the amount of use.Everything else is pretty sold. Construction is good, and wide neck is nice. Would love this product if not for the aforementioned.Lastly really, KK has design flaw. It's a huge pain in the ass to carry if not in your bag. They should be more flask shaped, and should sell a device to carry it on your body."
5,feeling eco friendly,"I LOVE my 40 oz Klean Kanteen. It really is huge but honestly I fill it with my Brita water every morning before work along with my 27 oz Klean Kanteen and its saved me so much money. I haven't bought bottled water in over 2 months when I used to buy water (Two 1 liter cases every other week) and I feel pretty good about not using so much plastic. The color is awesome, I definitely plan on buying another 40 oz. The price is a bit steep, but its saved me so much its been worth it. Plus Klean Kanteen is the recommended stainless steel water bottle choice, the other options have a liner to reduce sweating which can still release toxins in your water. These bottles do sweat A LOT though, that is one down side.I didn't have to pay for shipping since this item was available for super saver shipping, but I think it would've almost been worth it, don't hope for it to come faster than the expected ship date."
5,Super,You don't get any taste but the water and they are light. I also got a sling holder which makes it easy to take with.
4,Solid alternative to plastic water bottles,"I had seen these a year or two ago but wasn't sure if I would like the switch from bpa free plastic to aluminum.. Awesome bottle, no metallic taste and no complaints."
5,Clean and fresh!,Water tastes amazingly fresh from this Kanteen! Bottles are lightweight and almost indestructible... great product.
1,Klean Kanteen - the whistler,"I am very disappointed with the Klean Kanteen. I wastaken in by its sleek good looks and lack of plastic.However, it whistles when you drink from it! Thisis irritating and embarassing when dining with othersand at meetings."
5,Durable,"I bought 2 for my nephews because they needed more than the one they each had from before. They love them so much and use them daily in the house and in the car. My nephews are both under the age of 5 and with their playing there is some abuse with it being dropped and moved around a lot, they hold up very well. I love the new loop/sport cap. Will buy more soon."
5,"Lightweight, excellent design",It does what it's supposed to do. In retrospect I might have gone with unpainted as I expect the black paint will show wear and tear but I don't really care about that in a sports bottle.
5,Great bottle!,"This is a great bottle! Easy to clean, no funny taste, no risk of leaching like from the plastic bottles -- a winner all around. Klean Kanteen was the only bottle I could find in stock that had a large enough size for my needs(40 oz.)"
1,disappointing water bottle,"I purchased this bottle after the plastic water bottle scare came out. I read the reviews of how great the water tasted and no smell. When I received the bottle, I washed it by hand and let it air dry. When I smelled the empty bottle, it had an odor to it and I can't get rid of it. It's hard to describe the odor but it's almost like an (industrial) oil smell. I should have returned it but it's just sitting on my counter top collecting dust."
2,leaky lips,The lip of the bottle holds water which drips onto your face when you stop drinking. Very annoying. I would return the bottle if I could. I love the material and the concept but don't like the drip.
5,Awesome!,"I swear that good water bottles are about as hard to find as a good pair of shoes! But the Klean Kanteen is awesome. I purhcased the biggie just because I hate having to refill the bottle numerous times per day.The only problem is that it doesn't fit in my car cupholders ... but ... in all fairness, the lid is secure so it doesn't matter that it rolls around on the seat. It's just a minor inconvenience.It had a metalic smell when I first opened it so I was worried it would taste like metal. After a quick washing though, it was good to go.In fact, I liked it so much that I just ordered another one!"
5,kleen canteen review,great producrt but definitely get the sports top as the mouth on the regular canteen is so wide you end up spilling alot!
3,Not So Stainless Steel,"I've had my Kleen Canteen for over a year now. It's developed some rust spots inside at the bottom. A little rust won't kill me, the body needs iron after all. However for the premium price you pay for an item marketed as stainless steel, it really shouldn't be getting rusty like this."
3,Does not keep drink cold,"I bought this hoping it would keep my drink cold at work but it typically get hot after 2 hours. I work in a really cold environment but that does not help. The bottle sweats profusely, even when it is in its ""foamy"" holder. I have also noticed a metallic smell when I drink my water.I have given up trying to keep the drink cold and now just use it as an alternative bottle to plastic."
2,The point of the bottle is to keep the water IN,"The Sport Cap is complete junk, it has never properly sealed in the two or so years I've had it. In fact, I have two of these, and they both leak unless the bottles are upright and motionless. I'm also unimpressed with the taste, they occasionally impart an off taste to my water. It doesn't seem metallic, but I don't know what else it would be. It doesn't occur all the time, and I frankly haven't experimented to find out why. I have reverse osmosis water that runs about 20 ppm total dissolved solids--it doesn't have any taste to it, so it has to be coming from the bottle.I give it two stars only because I suppose it could be worse. The bottom line...I'm looking for something else."
5,Perfect size for my kindergarteners,"This was the 3rd water bottle I bought for my 5 year old's lunch box. She can easily open and close the cap, and it doesn't leak, so it's perfect! Highly recommended!"
3,Color very different,"The water bottle I received looks more cranberry than purple; even accounting for computer screen adjustment, prevention purple definitely doesn't look like it does in the picture."
2,"ok, as long as not used for school","I bought 2 120z bottles with the sports tops for my daughters to bring to use for snack and lunch. I read a bunch of reviews and was excited about these bottles because they weren't supposed to leak. We got them quickly, Amazon is great that way, and the girls brought them to school on Monday. Within a week I was getting reports of wet backpacks because they were leaking all over the inside of them. I was not happy about this and still haven't decided what to do about it. For now they are still using them, but are making sure that they are upright at all times and only if there is no other resort. I have found that the cheaper plastic versions seem to work better and will probably stick with those."
2,"""rocky""","bottom is not flat .. cannot set uprightgreat for carrying .. small, lightweight, cuteprobably won't be ordering another one"
2,Klean Kanteen,"The bottle cap is difficult to screw on and off, not the quality I expected for the price."
3,"Overpriced, but is there anything better out there?","It's a fine bottle. Stainless steel. Safe. Simple. Will not leak. Easy to drink from. Easy to take care of. But way overpriced for what it is. I can only imagine how cheaply these get made in China and how much money the company is pocketing. But it is almost the only stainless steel bottle I've seen on sale, so I decided to buy it despite the price. Unfortunately, just a few days after starting to use it, the steel cap detached from the plastic loop, the bottle fell to the floor and got dented. The bottle still works and I don't mind the ugly dent so much. It just shows how cheap a thing it is. I still recommend it, if you don't mind the price."
4,Noisy but great,"This bottle is so easy to clean (dishwasher), it is incredibly durable, and it is actually very light. My only complaint is that if you use the steel top, it is very noisy to open. It is metal on metal and makes a skin-crawling sound like fingernails on a chalkboard. I tend to make people cringe in yoga class or any other quiet room. If you get this bottle, choose the sport cap so that you don't have to twist it on and off."
5,We've loved our Klean Kanteens for about 2 years now...,"We've been drinking our water-to-go from Klean Kanteens for just over 2 years. Way back then, they didn't make a small bottle, so I ordered 3 large ones: 1 each for the 2 adults in our family, and 1 for our toddler. Now we have another kiddo and several more bottles - 2 small ones and another large. None of our bottles, old or new, make our water taste at all metallic, and the only leaky lid we've had was the first sippy cup attachment (Klean Kanteen sent us a replacement which didn't leak). We use them for outings, school lunches, and on our bedside tables overnight."
5,Just what I needed,"After a I lost my last leaky water bottle, I went to Amazon to see what was there. I bought the 27-ounce black Klean Kanteen with a sport lid. The positives started with paying about half of what I would have in a local sporting good store. I use it primarily as a workout bottle, followed by mixing a recovery drink powder. The wide mouth makes it easy to pour in the powder and it doesn't leak when I shake it with a closed sport lid. Great looking bottle, and if their claims are true about the environmental impact, can't imagine any other way to go."
2,very disappointed,"After researching many stainless steel water bottles I selected Klean Kanteen for my three grandchildren. Although I felt the price was high for such a water bottle I felt it was a good investment in my grandchildren's good health(priceless). Now however, after recieving them and using them for only a couple of weeks the paint is chipping off of them and one of the bottles was sent with a different top. I do not know what materials are in this top that my grandson must put in his mouth to get a drink of water from his bottle. This is not what I ordered. So, this being said, I am very disappointed in the paint-chipping, nozzle-clad bottles. I would truly like my money returned.Karen Grasso"
3,Not all that I hoped and dreamed,"My expectations were very high for this bottle and were unfortunately not met. I'm sure it's perfect for some people and their uses. My use is at the gym primarily while running on the treadmill.The sport cap makes an annoying draining sound when you use it and I am constantly banging it on my teeth. I've found a good angle to hold it so that this happens less often, but still annoying.I have the 40oz red one and I'm tired of everyone asking me ""what is that? A fire extinguisher?"".On the treadmill, the bottle's large girth means it fit awkwardly into either the ledge or onto the pocket (depending on which treadmill you're using).Pros: the water tastes great and the metal keeps it cold for a long time. The sport is smart but a little ill-designed. Eager for the next version."
5,great bottle,"after receiving a dented and stained bottle amazon quickly and at no cost shipped me a new one and this one came in mint condition... i decided on the plain steel color with no paint and i couldn't be happier... this bottle is very ""heavy duty"" and not thin like other cheaper steel bottles i have seen around... the sports cap does whistle when you drink out of it but nothing too obnoxious... it also comes with a cap that clicks onto the part where you put your mouth which i thought was thoughtful...as far as the ""leaking"" everyone complains about i have yet to experience this however when turned completely upside down a slight slight dribble does start to form where the air vent is but it is completely sealed around the cap and the part where you drink from.. overall i am very satisfied and also i would recommend to buy the chico bag sling for this... it fits perfect and makes it easy to carry this bottle hiking or wherever if using a carabiner isn't your thing!"
5,Great BPA free water bottle,For some reason it took a long time for amazon to ship my Klean Kanteen but I love it. There is no metallic taste and the cap creates a good seal so there are no leaks.
5,Thick stainless - excellent top,"What can I say, its a bottle?Very thick materialLid does not leakI like the 18 oz sizeFits in my drink net on my back pack. slung it out a few times slamming the ground and did not damage it.I am very rough with this bottle. I take everyday to work and have dropped a few times on pavement. No issue, no dents. Lid hit pavement one time and is still in tact.I thought this was high and I was paying too much but went to walmart and found a stainless bottle for $7......was happy I had bought this one because that one was extremely thin......more than I would have thought. This Klean Kanteen is definitely a good value if you use it frequently.Summary,I am happy with this purchase."
2,Makes My Water Taste Awful,The Klean Kanteen imparts a metallic flavor to the water. I was surprised because it comes so highly rated. I'm going to have to get a lined steel water bottle I guess.
5,Great bottle,"I've been using this bottle for about a month now and have no issues with it whatsoever, it has already taken a lot of abuse and besides a few dents and scratches (I bought it because I needed a bottle that could take a beating) I have no issues with it. It doesn't leak at all and I haven't noticed a metallic taste from it at all, I will defiantly buy another in the future."
1,Items leaks after less than a month,I bought two of these bottles. I like aluminum drinking bottles because of my fears about BPA and plasic. After less than 6 weeks the white button that controls the air flow in and out of the bottle (as you drink) fell off and water now leaks from the hole that it left. The bottle is useless. At this price I expected better quality. Amazon were completely non responsive regarding returnig this item.
4,good bottle,This bottle works well to carry water for short walks/hikes. It is quite small though. Overall I am pleased with my purchase.
3,"Nice Bottle, But Weird Noises","When I first got this bottle I really liked it. As many others have noted, it's easy to fill, easy to clean, and easy to drink from. But my wife pointed out from the beginning, which I tried to ignore (but ignoring her has its consequences), this bottle makes a weird noise when you drink out of it. It sounds like a horse whinnying. I tried making adjustments to the sports cap (I have the new one), but to no avail. The whinnying continues. Making matters worse, every time I drink out of this thing, my wife mimics the noise: Wehehehe!! Wehehehe!!Update: after researching further, I found some helpful hints right here on Amazon. If you loosen the cap just before it starts to leak, there is a lot less noise - sometimes no noise at all. It also helps to hold the bottle so that the little white valve points up."
2,good but not the best,"these are good solid products, . However, the best stainless water bottle out there is made by Guyot. Its got a bigger mouth opening which I find easier to drink AND clean. they are now hard to find and are a bit pricie 20-24.00 but worth it. Amazon, believe it or not, does not sell them. I understand that Nagalene either bought them or has made a liscening deal and they will be distributing them this spring. This may sound a bit thick but stainless is not as durable as plastic and what I find most annoying, you can not tell how much fluid is in there with out peering into the black bottle. Also Naglene makes a non bpa canteen- the old version at 1/10 the price."
2,Poorly designed muzzle,"+ I don't know what the harmful substance is called that is used frequently, but I read this bottle is free of it, so that's a good thing.+ Bottle has a great form/presentation (color, design of the logo etc.).+ The bottle was delivered by itself with no extraneous packaging. I like this minimalistic trend.- If you keep water in this bottle for over 12h it starts tasting really weird (metallic).- The muzzle has a diameter which makes it near impossible for me to drink properly from it. The upper side of the muzzle blocks my nose. I would have preferred it to be either larger or smaller, but this diameter doesn't work for me.- The muzzle is completely exposed (even if you close the bottle). If you use it outdoors, dirt, germs, and other unsanitary material can easily attach itself from the rim you drink from. I would have preferred that when you close the bottle, the mouth-contact rim would be completely covered by the cap."
2,Not the best for the gym,"Many people opted for stainless bottles when the whole BPA scare happened. I purchased a couple of these bottles, but then returned them after seeing how they were constructed.The opening that you drink from is not covered by the lid, as it is with other water bottles. This makes it a bad item to take to the gym, which is nothing more than a giant petri dish for germs. If you grab the bottle by the top (not by the ring), or if it falls over or comes into contact with anything, you end up putting it directly into your mouth. Worrying about BPA is great, but the probability of catching something from the gym is a lot higher. I would recommend a bottle with a covered lid - I ended up purchasing some from CamelBak."
3,little bit of a dribble cup,"After reading recent information about Sigg not sharing info about chemicals used to line the interior of their bottle, we opted to switch to Kleen Kanteen for the stainless steel. There are pros & cons:1) obvious pro - the materials are known to be safe2) the bottles sweat where as the Sigg did not sweat at all3) the mouth of the bottle is large enough for ice cubes but makes it a bit more difficult to drink out of -- kind of like drinking out of a 1qt gatorade bottle --- sometimes a little bit dribbles out.4) My 18month old loves his bottle because its the same color (stainless steel) as his dad's. We got him the sport top instead of the sippy top - and he manages just fine.5) the slim shape fits nicely in most cup holders and water bottle carriers"
1,What happened to the stainless steel caps?,"I just received my Klean Kanteen - probably the 15th I have purchased. I own a couple, and have given many as gifts. But alas, the company has done a bait & switch with the caps. What happened to the stainless steel caps??? They used to come standard. The whole idea was to have the internal part of the screw top to be steel, like the inside of the bottle - so there's no plastic touching your liquid. The exterior grip on the lid was always plastic - that's fine. But now, you have to buy the original stainless screw cap, as an accessory, that costs more than 1/3 as much as the entire bottle product. This bottle if great, but now go buy the staibless steel cap for $5.45.Shame on you Klean Kanteen."
3,Decent But Wide Mouth is Counterproductive,"This fulfills every function of a stainless steel water bottle. However, the wide mouth design for ice cubes is a serious compromise in drinkability. I much prefer the SIGG-size mouth which is made for a human drinker rather than giant ice cubes."
3,Paint is peeling off outside after a few weeks.,"I have owned several of the plain unpainted stainless Klean Kanteen bottles and have liked them all. I decided to purchase the smallest size as a water bottle for 8 year old son's school lunch bag. When it arrived we were thrilled at the bright red paint and we liked the bottle very much. Now, after a few weeks the paint is peeling off the outside of the water bottle and we didn't do anything unusual to it to cause this. I am disappointed in the product due to this. I will not be purchasing another of the colored bottles, but will stick with the plain steel ones in the future."
2,Not good for kids,"We bought this to send clean water to school. We bought the pop-top with it. We put a sock on it to keep it from sweating on on our son's desk.It dented very easily within the first week, and so it barely stands up. Also the cap that goes over the pop-top fits tightly (good for cleanliness) so it is difficult for kids to pull off.Love the fact that it is stainless, but the bottom needs reinforcement. With the weight of the water, I doubt if the rubber sock they sell would have protected it from the dent."
2,"Don't know if mine is defective, but....","The bottle I received makes a weird noise when I am drinking from it. The sound gets a chuckle from my husband and my kids each time I use it, but I don't want to risk stares from people outside of my house, so I never take it anywhere with me. Additionally, it gathers a lot of condensation...it kind of needs its own attached coaster to solve this problem, or to be more insulated, but it lacks in both areas. The only thing I really like is the size...I will be replacing this for something more carefully designed."
5,These bottles are pretty good yo,"These bottles are, to put it quite plainly, a work of art. I ordered a 27oz poly loop cap bottle and couldn't be more satisfied. Perfect size, weight, and doesn't retain taste and bacteria unlike the plastic nalgene I ordered a couple months ago. 5 stars."
3,recent purchase of kleen kanteen,"the kleen kanteen is supposed to be one of the better stainless steel bottles to buyhowever the ones i ordered all came dinged and marked and the lids squeek throughout turning and don't seem to sit tightly even though they are following the ""treads"" in the cap properly. Some of these defects may be due to shipping. Overall the mouthsize is good, it allows ice cubes in but is not so big you spill out like the larger mouth bottles and it does keep fluids cold. You may want a cooler bag for it in the summer as it will sweat (naturally)."
4,Satisfied.,"I am satisfied with this product. I purchased it for my 4-year-old daughter to take along on activities such as gymnastics and ballet - and just to have around for convenience. And that's exactly what's it's been - very convenient. I have only one gripe: if you do not make sure that the cap is pushed down (hard) and snapped into place, it will leak when tipped over. If it is snapped into place, then it does not seem to leak. But the force it takes to push it down is more than my 4 year old can manage on her own, so it has caused some leaks. But since we only use this bottle for water, nothing horrible resulted from that. Overall, I would buy this product again and am more pleased than displeased. Also, my bottle is pink and the paint has not chipped at all as some other reviewers indicated it might."
5,"After using the bottles for over a year, they're still like new","I purchased 4 of the small Klean Kanteen's with sports caps to use in my sons' lunchboxes. They are great! No leaks, no rust, no problems & I wash them in dishwasher everytime. I recently purchased the Eco Vessel bottles because I needed more and I liked the colors, big mistake. One was the wrong bottle - wrong color & wrong top (loop vs. sports cap). Another one, the top of the bottle is stripped after only using it once. Also the paint is coming off. I should have just ordered more Klean Kanteen's like I had originally planned."
5,Trendy bottle keeps water fresh and odor-free,"The Klean Kanteen is ideal for carrying water to the gym or placing on your table at work. Water left in it overnight remains fresh and doesn't taste or smell metallic. While it is certainly rather pricey compared to plastic water bottles, one doesn't mind paying extra for a bpa-free, stainless steel bottle that looks real hip."
5,Can't beat them....,"These little water bottles are fantastic. I have one, my wife has one, and both of our daughter's use them. Three of us use the 2.0 sport caps and our youngest uses the Avent sippy adapter. This is a must have product!"
4,Reliable water bottle is reliable,"I've used this thing for about a month now. I still haven't figured out how to wash it well (don't really have a brush because hooray, college), but filling it with hot soapy water and shaking it, then rinsing it 6-7 times seems to work. The only real con is that the mouth of the bottle is really big for people with small mouths. Sometimes I'll go to take a drink carelessly and end up with water all over myself, which I just think is funny. Otherwise, I have no complaints about it at all!"
3,addendum to other 40 oz review---,"I didn't mean to be so harsh. I AM happy with my 4 bottles... and still recommend the company- just check the cap fitment, so you don't end up with a bad fit. After all- these guys are trying to use something better for your health than Lexan with it's bad chemicals.... and in that regard, they are right on."
1,Picky shopper.,"The first one I recieved had a dent, so I sent it in for a replacement. The second one had paint along the lip and was not sealed properly. The third was just like the second one. Three times is a charm. I'm sending in the third one for a refund."
3,Klean Kanteen,"Was dissapointed to find that the Kleen Kanteen is made in China. You may want to think twice before using this container indoors or at work. When you take a drink from it, it makes a chirpping sound that makes people stop and look. Other than that, it is easy to carry."
4,Nice reusable stainless steel bottle,I bought Klean Kanteens to replace older Nalgene bottle based on the other reviews. Pretty much they are very good. The bottles are built very well but will dent if dropped on a hard surface - no leaks yet. The poly loop cap tends to hold on to odors - Kool Aid and lemonade odors lingered in the cap even after several washes.
4,"I loved this, but my family does not.","I've bought a total of 6 Klean Kanteens. One for me, my husband, my mom, pop, brother, and sister-in-law. I love mine. I think water tastes cleaner coming from the Klean Kanteen than the plastic one I was using. Plus, with all the concern with BPA this was a great solution. My husband and I use it daily, but I don't see my in-laws use it as much. My mother-in-law said hers has a funny taste. I think that ""funny taste"" is called clean water and not BPA plastic water. But what do I know...I'm just the daughter-in-law..."
4,I love this bottle,"The bottle is great and as long as you don't leave it in the car, the water is always a nice temperature for drinking. I got this size and the 27 oz and find myself using the 27 oz more often because it's smaller and easier to stow. I keep the 40 oz at my desk so i always have water at the office. The only shame is that it doesn't come with the Steel cap; I think that should be standard with a steel bottle - hence the 4 stars instead of 5.As a side note, the bottle has never leaked out of either cap (which is something I read in a review prior to buying it)."
4,great taste but watch out for paint chips!,"I love my Kanteen. The water tastes great, I look trendy drinking from it, and it doubles as a weapon in an emergency. The only criticism I would have is the paint chips off if your rough with it like I am. Be careful, you might be better off with an unpainted one."
4,"Great product, but not perfect","I really love my Klean Kanteen bottle. But I have a couple of minor gripes.I deducted a star, because:a. There's a definite metallic smell, which is a bit of a turn-off when drinking out of the bottle. I don't think it impacts the taste, but it's still an obvious metallic smell.b. The wide mouth design on this particular model sometimes causes extra water to overflow and run down my face and on to my shirt. So, if you're dying of thirst and want to gulp your water down, be prepared to get semi-soaked in the process. Definitely more of a sipping bottle. Just something you have to get used to.On the other hand, the wide-mouth design makes it possible to wash this model in the dishwasher. That was the main reason I bought it. I hate hand-washing stuff in the sink. This model can go straight in the dishwasher; a big plus for people like me.All in all, this is a great product."
4,Sleek and Satisfying :],"I really like these bottles. They're so sleek and they do their job well. It doesn't really make sense to have the poly bottle top, but I still bought that type b/c I didn't want to dish out the extra bucks for the SS top. My young boys really enjoy using theirs too. I drink a lot more water now that I have these. They're made in China but the label says they're ""responsibly made in China"" - hopefully that's the truth! The mouth opening is just the right size, big enough to fit ice cubes in, but not too big that I'm dribbling all over!"
2,"""Sweats"" way too much!","This is a solid and attractive bottle overall, but I was extremely disappointed by the amount of water that it ""sweats"" / the high condensation. I like to put a lot of ice cubes into my water (which is easy to do with the wide opening), but within seconds the entire exterior is line with water droplets and I am forced to keep a paper towel around it. And this layer will keep re-forming after each wipe for at least 10 minutes, until the water has finally cooled down a bunch (but I like it cold!). This is extremely aggravating!Also, on a side note, it squeaks whenever I drink from it! This is more bearable, but still annoying."
5,awesome,"I purchased these for my whole family in all different sizes and colors. We use them daily and really enjoy them, plus, they make it easier for us to get our daily amount of water in."
3,Go for the metal finish instead,"I give the bottle a 5 star - good taste, no leaking. My husband has the metal finish bottle (no paint) and has no complaints.The paint, however, is not durable. I got the brown and black bottles (I got the colored bottles so my kids can tell which is theirs with a glance.) After two camping trips and a month of going back and forth to school, the paint is nicked and scratched a great deal. The paint is almost completely gone on a ring on the bottom, where the bottle rests while standing up. Standing your bottle on a desk or counter is normal use, and shouldn't wear away paint in only a month."
4,Great!,"Great product, Flat cap is not dishwasher safe. Sport cap does make a noise while drinking. Bottles are stronger than other brands."
4,I like it,"Here are the things I like:-the sports cap is easy to put on and off and protects the nipple thing from all the gross stuff on my hands-it looks and feels like it is made of quality components-it's hip and now I'm cool like the rest of the kids... ;)Here are the things I don't like:-it is hard for my wife to get the cap off sometimes when the metal is at certain temperatures (i.e. cold and the metal has contracted)-the air inlet valve makes a little high pitched slurpedy sluuurrrrprprprpr slurp! sound whenever you drink out of it. my friend's doesn't do this, but this one does. We don't care, but when my wife drinks out of it in the middle of the night it can wake me up.-I wish it had BPA in it. ... that was a joke. kthankxbai"
2,Cannot get used to the metal taste,"I bought the blue Kleen Canteen bottle and I loved it for a while. But then (maybe after a week of use) I started to taste the metal of the bottle in my water. I am barely ever home because of school, so I heavily rely on canteens or reusable water bottles. I was (and still am) concerned about the contents of the plastic in plastic water bottles diffusing into my drinking water, but I just cannot take another sip of metallic water! It was getting to the point that drinking the water from my Kleen Kanteen made me nauseous! I tried many things, including using vinegar and baking soda to remove the metallic taste (as advised in the official website) with success for maybe a few hours during the day. I have officially given up, and have retired my Kleen Kanteen for about two weeks now. I may use it once in a while, but for everyday constant use, it just isn't for me."
3,High-quality but annoying gurgling sound,"This water bottle is well made with quality materials, but I can't get past the annoying, high-pitched gurgling sound that the air valve makes when drinking from it. I have the 40 oz. model and take it to work with me every day. Anyone within about a 100 ft radius can hear the obnoxiously loud gurgling noise--it's actually quite disruptive. People look around, wondering where the heck the noise is coming from. The spectacle was humorous at first, but eventually drinking becomes annoying and embarrassing. Having to hold a finger over the valve with one hand to dampen the sound and gripping the bottle with the other hand makes for a cumbersome and awkward drinking routine. If I was not in an office environment, the noise would not bother me."
1,"Squeaked, leaked and was hard to get the water out of - Boo to this one!","Please see title - it really does tell the full story of my much anticipated start on my way of ""Going Green,"" and saving money. Not a good investment that I have since returned. I will try another brand that they have at my local Health food store. The bottle if called ""Green Bottle"" and is stainless steel as well with the same type of sports cap that I need and like."
2,Lasted only 6 months...,"My Klean Kanteen bottle lasted only 6 months before becoming unusable, due to 2 serious problems:(1) The cap is next-to-impossible to clean. The cavity of the cap is not uniformly circular: it has 2 concave holes. Even though I tried to wash the cap dutifully, I couldn't get the few remaining spores of mildew that always burrows into porous plastic. As a result, water kept in the bottle for over 24 hours gets this unpleasant old smell, similar to week-old water in a plastic water bottle. I have to BOIL the cap regularly to prevent this.(2) The paint on the bottom of the bottle started peeling off, and now leaves pieces of paint everywhere. I have only set the bottle down on wood and plastic tables, so there wasn't any heavy wear or tear.Perhaps if I had chosen brushed steel colour and then purchased an additional cap, then this wouldn't have happened. But now I have a sub-par water bottle. (I used the magnet test to verify that this is a genuine Klean Kanteen.)"
3,mostly paying for name,"I bought this to save money on disposable water bottles. I didn't know anything about any of the brands, but the reviews seemed really good on this one. I found a $5 one at Walmart and bought it too, just to compare. They are pretty much the same, except the Klean Kanteen seems to be a thicker metal. They were both dropped accidentally and the Klean Kanteen dented. The cheap Walmart one didn't. I wouldn't spend the extra money to have a fancy logo and paint job. Just go to Walmart."
2,get ready for spam,product is fine but they will not stop emailing you. They will even send email saying they don't send much email and then go ahead and send you more.
1,Klean Kanteen,"Terrible customer service. Could not get through to vendor for a week. When I finally did, they gave me another number to call which was for some other business. The product came 3 weeks late and when it did come, it was the wrong product. I sent it all back. Will never order from this vendor ever again"
1,Total rip off!!!!,"I bought the 40 ounce version on Ebay with free shipping for $28.00. I was expecting MUCH more for the high price. The Kleen kanteen is NOT insulated at all. If you put something cold in it, expect it to get warm really fast. If you put hot stuff in it (like me), expect it to get cold fast. Expect to burn your fingers every time you pick it up. Expect to burn your inner lip on hot metal ever time you take a sip. The steel is VERY thin. I expect that if i dropped it, it would certainly dent.This product is honestly worth about 6-8 dollars. If I bought it from their website for $28 AND paid the high shipping cost, I'd be enraged when the product arrived. It's simply way too expensive."
3,Limited experience...,"I have only had this item for several weeks, but it seems to be a well constructed bottle. I may add more once I have used it for a longer period of time."
3,Sounds like a dolphin..,"Love the water bottle! My colleague loved it too, so she bought one for herself. HOWEVER, her sport cap doesn't squeak at all, while mine makes this annoying dolphin noise whenever I try to drink out of it. I've tried several different positions, but no matter how I do it, it still makes dolphin noises at me. Someone heard the noise and asked if it was marketed that way.. you know.. a dolphin water bottle. That might be a brilliant idea, but just not what I was expecting out of this water bottle."
4,Quality product,I use this water bottle at work and for me steel water bottles like this is better than the plastic ones. I just don't like the odor it produces after a day of using it. Maybe because the water I use from the filter at work? But I wash it everyday so no biggie.
2,not as good as i thought...,"was exited to start helping the environment. i hate the spout, it leaks. also it is hard to clean. problem with the stainless steel is that it imparts taste to your water. i hate the way the water taste, i've since moved to the bobble which has a built in filter to remove taste from tap water. works great!"
2,"plastic cap, really?",Why bother? Get one that has a stainless steel cap and skip right past this. It even leaks sometimes if I have it laying on the seat in my car. There are much better buys out there.
3,Just OK,"This arrived dented on the top on the inner seam, so I had to send it back. Also, the sport cap I received needed a little pushing to one side for the spout to close completely. Overall, it looks nice and I feel like as long as you didn't drop it too much it would probably last quite a while.Camelbak has some really sleek looking stainless steel water bottles (with a neatly welded/soldered looking seam rather than rolled) with a sport-type top - my sister received one as a gift and if the person I bought this for had not gotten two other water bottles before I could give one to him, I would go for one just like what my sister received."
3,Good Idea but product needs better quality control!,"I bought two of the Klean Kanteens previously and was not quite sure about wether the product was worth the price paid and I have to say they could come down on the price especially since the last one I bought, $16.00 for a 27oz stainless steel bottle; had a defect in the bottom because the quality of the stainless steel is too thin! Hey, Kleen Kanteen, lets up our quality control."
3,Deceptive description,"The item description said that the ""country of origin"" for Kleen Kanteen was Spain. When I received the bottle, the label said ""Made in China"".I would not have purchased if I had known that it was truly made in China.Please stop this deception!"
3,Love stainless steel but,Cute stainless steel water bottles but I have a hard time getting the cap off to drink so I am concerned whether or not my young children will or not. I bought a couple for lunch boxes so we will see.
3,klen can,"Price is too high,Wal Mart has stainless steel THERMOS for $10.00 they are better quality and keep the water cold .If I could get a refund I would return the KLEEN Kanteen. Also the THERMOS is made in U.S.A. not China."
1,NOT AS PICTURED,"We love Klean Kanteen but this ""orange sunset"" looks nice and bright orange and when it arrived it is a brownish orange and really a horrible color. It isn't worth it to me to send it back with shipping charges so unfortunately we have to keep it. This picture does not show the correct color of orange sunset. I would have ordered blue or something else for my husband. This is why we are disappointed."
3,MADE IN CHINA!,"I should have looked into it better but this bottle is made in China! Granted, I'm not necessarily against buying products made in China but I am against advertising sustainability and eco-friendliness when your product comes from a country that does very little to protect the environment. Not to mention the cheap labor of China you would expect the bottle to be priced a little lower. $30 is what I would expect to pay for an American or European made product using the more expensive eco-friendly processes. For future bottles I will look into California based Camelbak to see how they produce their products."
2,"Looks cool, tastes AWFUL","I bought this to get away from my polyarbonate Nalgene bottles, but it's a non-starter. This bottle added a horrible metallic ""tang"" taste and smell to the water I drank out of it. I still want to find a BPA-free bottle, but I can't use this one.I'd have given it one star, but it gets two for being BPA-free and looking nice. If you don't mind it imparting a metallic funk to your water, this may be the bottle for you."
4,"Nice product, except for one issue",When you suck the water it makes a spluttery noise! Other than that..its is a solid built to last steel water bottle.
4,Pretty good,This is easy to clean and drink out of. It can sometimes be hard to get the lid off so don't wrench it on too tight. I have not had any problems with it leaking and I have it on its side all the time. I am pretty happy with them overall. Be careful not to drop it. It does dent easy.
5,Great Kanteen!,I use my 27 oz. KK everyday! From home to the office it's always by my side. It's true the KK sweats when you add ice to keep your drink cold but that doesn't bother me. All you need to a napkin to place underneath and you're good. i didn't get the sports cap since all those leak no matter what brand. The KK is a great choice for the outdoors as well. I take it hunting every chance I get and have had no problem with the size or weight. Get on and you'll love it!
5,Best Waterbottle I've Ever Owned,"I don't know if it could stand a car driving over it, but it's a very good water bottle. Extremely durable, and can keep liquids cold for a decent amount of time. I try to carry it around all the time to remind me to drink more water."
4,REALLY like this bottle.,"I bought this for my son to take to school because I was sick of spending money on juice boxes. It gets too heavy for him if I fill it to the top, so I just fill it part way. It's plenty for him to drink, and there is room for more when he gets older. He likes the sport cap especially. I have put milk, water, juice, and tea in it, and it doesn't affect the taste of the drink at all.------------AddendumWhile I still love this bottle, I have come to find out that this bottle will leak (from the valve, I suppose) when tossed about in a lunch box and backpack. Not a ton, but enough to wet whatever it's with. Sad to take off a star. I think I will replace the top with the scre-type and call it good."
5,LOVE IT!,"I recently (November '10) purchased the 40 oz wide mouth bottle along with the 27 oz standard and 27 oz wide mouth bottles. I received exactly what I ordered, in excellent condition, packaged well, and delivered on time. I got multiple different ones to try them and decide which one I like the best. I've found that I need the 40 oz bottle otherwise I have to refill it too often, however my husband prefers the 27 oz size.Pros: stainless (of course), great selection of sizes and lids, narrow and wide mouth tops, easy to clean (with a bottle brush), can fill with milk, juice, sports drink, etc without retaining taste or odors.Cons: wish I could get a splash guard accessory (to keep ice/water from splashing back when you drink) and wish I could get the rolled rim on the wide mouth bottle (it is a little more comfortable to drink from). Really, I can't think of anything negative to say about the product or company. None of mine came with any of the so-called ""green goo""."
5,Klean Kanteen,"I love this thing. I bought one for me and one from my girlfriend. After reading much about water toxicity from plastic bottles my intention was to never buy bottled water in a plastic bottle again and this has allowed me to do that. Not to mention that the plastic bottle then finds its way to a landfill somewhere. This exact bottle was written up in Time magazine as one of the safest. Plus it has a simple unpretentious look to it, unlike the fancy Sigg bottle."
4,Thought-provoking and interesting,"Mr. Regan draws on an impressive knowledge of law and the subtleties of human relationships in this book. I found it scholarly, but more or less accessible, as well as organized and thorough. At times approaching the philosophical, Mr. Regan's work left me more knowledgeable about his subject, but also more aware of my own place in a relationship and in society. This is not just a book for law students."
5,Genealogical Triumph!,"What a fine way to be entertained and to learn history at the same time. Ida Luttrell gives personality and depth to her forebears and makes their 200 year progress from New York to Texas both heart-warming and heart-aching. Obviously the result of careful research and great story-telling, this is genealogy at its best."
5,Fantastic!!,"When will Elfman get his due credit? The man is one of the most versatile composers of his day, and has not been awarded a thing. Personally I think that Nightmare before Christmas was his best. But Corpse Bride was fantastic. He know how to fit into Burton's visions perfectly."
5,Flawless music. What more can I say?,"This is one of my absolute favourite albums of all time, soundtrack or otherwise. Every track on this album is a gem, but particular standouts are: What's This?, Sally's Song, Finale/Reprise, Closing and End Title(where all the various themes are brought together so brilliantly). I'd recommend this to all fans of Danny Elfman or musicals in general, but really, anyone who enjoys strong, melodic music will enjoy this.All I can do now is beg Danny Elfman to bring us another musical soon!"
5,Extraordinary,"Out of the numerous film scores that I have listened to, this one will always stick out formost in my mind as the best. Its hard to explain the beauty of this haunting, hilarious, emotional, and invigorating film score in detail, yet I can tell you that once you begin to listen to this magical score, you can never stop. I have been tirelessly listening night after night since Halloween of last year, when I first discovered this CD during my 'spring cleaning' exercises. I can't imagine life without it... Elfman has once again created a masterpiece. I highly recommend the listener to purchase this CD. Its well worth the happy ecstacy of listening to it over and over again ( times infinity) . The simple yet haunting beauty of Sally's Song, the deep emotional chords rippling throughout the background, the joy of Halloweenland's Making Christmas; all these and more await your ears!"
5,Every word in every song amazes me!,"I love this album so much. So much work has gone into making the songs really interesting and the lyrics are fun, surprising and when listening one never ceases to notice something new. A true work of genius."
5,Great Great Great Halloween and Christmas CD!!!,"I can't express how wonderful this cd is!! Jack and Sally have GREAT chemistry and you can't help to love Lock, Shock, and Barrel. Excellent film and perfect soundtrack. It has a mix of everything; slow and meloncholy, uplifting and relatable, evil and twisted songs. It suits all types of personalities. You'll enjoy it no matter your age."
4,love the sling,"A very convenient way to have the baby with me while I do some things around the house, eat a meal or check my email. She just snoozes away in her cozy position. The only thing I would like to change is the elasticity of the fabric. I wish it was more stretchy and breathable for the coming seasons. Otherwise, it's easy to fit in the diaper bag, matches my clothes and works great."
4,Great purchase,"I love my hotsling. I bought it when my 5 month old was getting too heavy to carry for very long. He is now over 20 lbs and I use it as a hip carrier all the time - watering the plants outside, walking on the beach, runnning into the grocery store for a few things, doing chores around the house. He loves it too. He is very content in it, and enjoys ""participating"" in my chores instead of being stuck in his exersaucer or highchair. It is a little pricey for a simple piece of material (why I didn't give it 5 stars), but it works, and I am happy with my purchase. Making sure you get the right size is crucial! I got a size 2 and probably could have gotten a size 1. But I washed it in hot water and put it in the dryer and now it is perfect."
4,Love it,"This is the perfect carrier for my 5 month old daughter. She also likes the baby bjorn, but the hotsling lets her rest without having to hold her head up all of the time. It also provides more closeness between mom and baby. It is easy on my back and I feel totally comfortable in it. At 5 months, my daughter does not last more than an hour or two in it unless she is sleeping. She like to work her hands and feet too much. I can't wait until she is a little bigger and I can put her in the hip carry. I really wish that I would have had this when she was born. I highly recommend the hotsling and will get one for my friends who are pregnant."
4,Interesting novel,"I really enjoyed this novel, and while it wasn't necessarily the same as other books I've read by French, that didn't bother me at all. I thought this book gave the reader a really good idea of what it might feel like to be a person dealing with mental illness and to be that out of control. I was definitely surprised by the ending, and while I had some suspicions, I didn't suspect the ending at all. I also like the way French changed the book's point of view half way through. The first half told by Holly and the second told by Meg. I thought that was very refreshing. All in all I enjoyed this book a lot and it was easy to read. I am a big fan of this writing duo and hope they continue writing entertaining novels."
1,Not even luke warm...,"I have read most of Nicci French's novels, starting with ""Killing Me Softly,"" which I consider the best of the lot. This book, ""Catch When I Fall,"" was a master chore to finish. I read books to be entertained, no matter the genre. I was not entertained with this novel. I felt nothing, in fact I found it to be laborious to complete. Some part of a book usually reaches out and grabs me, whether it be fear, humor, disgust, heart beating romance ,or some action-adventure, but this book and Holly Krauss bored me. Her long winded descriptive details of her miserable life bored me. I skimmed pages and would stop and read the same pathetic boring drivel. The only characters that I found even remotely interesting were her husband Charlie and her best friend Meg... Not what I expected."
3,Expected more from this author...,I was mildly disappointed - I like this author(s) and expected better creation than this.Their other books (The Memory Game for expample) are much better.
4,Unique and lovely bottle stopper,"This Norpro bottle stopper is a unique and attractive bottle stopper. It's reasonably priced, and would make a fine gift."
3,Running Mates,"The movie was enjoyable, although the sound quality of the tape could have been better."
1,"So, you want to start a mushroom farm.","Beware. This ""book"" is more like an attempt at an informational news column. The format is not dissimilar to that of an ambitious student's term paper (do not be fooled into thinking you are getting a professionally printed spiral bound book) and the content is vague and often incorrect (not to mention the atrocious grammar and spelling...get an editor or proofreader, please). If you want to start a mushroom farm, start by devouring ""Growing Gourmet and Medicinal Mushrooms,"" then back it up with some serious small business reading (I suggest searching ""starting your own business""). A business is a business, and aside from some subtle differences they are all the same, and need a solid plan and honest accounting to work; learn how to run a business before you start constructing your farm. Good luck!"
1,Ilingo,This does not even load when using mac's lion operating system. Had to return it! Don't waste your time. Buy something else.
1,"Move along, please","This is nothing other than a repackaging of ""Morrissey: A Jewel In The Crown."" If you own that DVD (and if you're a hardcore Moz fan you probably do,) then skip this - it's the EXACT same thing.The description is misleading, there is no rare performance footage. In fact, the first 5 seconds of the film clearly state there is no Morrissey music at all in the entire film. Features long, drawn-out interviews with people who worked with Moz on his records.If you are a serious Moz fan and don't already own ""Jewel In The Crown,"" you may want to consider this, but you'll probably end up only watching it once. There are no revelations in this."
1,Quality unknown,"Ignore the poor rating. I really can't evaluate the quality of the product because the merchant I purchased it from sent a box that had a 2003 label on it. I doubt that seven year old hair coloring is any good. I used the product before I noted how old it was and it did not color very well (I wanted something to cover gray). I suspect it was the age of the product because it got a very good review in a consumer magazine that reviews products. I didn't check the date on the merchandise until after I used the product and saw how poor it was. Had I noticed the date before using I would have returned the product.This system forces you to assign a rating to a product but the one star probably does not really reflect the product. Gee, it would be nice to have a better rating system. I won't purchase from this vendor again."
3,Meh,"I received this as a gift. I absolutely love Savannah, GA and love learning about it so I was definitely thrilled to have received this, especially it being a History channel documentary... but I've been more amused by the books I've read about Savannah than actually watching this. It wasn't bad by any means but some parts kind of dragged on, felt repetitive at some parts and Savannah has SO MUCH to offer I felt more could have been added to it."
1,Lapses in Historical Accuracy,"As with the book, Wood had created serious lapses in historical accuracy in the film. It is simply incorrect to call Alexander or his Macedonian army ""Greek"", when the ancient Greek and Roman historians made a clear distinction between the Greek and Macedonian nations. Alexander was known as Macedonian and had never been called ""Greek"" in any ancient text, and Wood should have represented him for what he was. Instead he left an inaccurate portrait of the famous conqueror ascribing him a false ethnicity and identity for which he was also sharply criticized by Archaeology in 1998."
4,A Journey Hard to Conceive,"I'm enjoying this series greatly. I've only given it four stars because I think it needs more maps or graphic support to the story. Most of us are probably not as familiar with Alexander the Great as is our host in the series. That said, however, the vivid portayal of the people and their present ways of life along the journey are forcefully revealing. I don't think I've ever had a better or more piercing insight into the men of Afghanistan, even after all the years of Western reporting from the war there. That alone was worth watching everything else. Everything else, however, is equally revealing of the cultures described as as they are today millenia after Alexander's passage. You won't be disappointed!"
5,Great piece by Michael Wood,Michael Wood ranks among the best in describing everything he sees by going step by step on his research adventures.
5,The Conquest of the World,"What a journey. Michael Wood's documentary is astounding. In the first episode we are in Greece; in the last episode we have reached India. My favourite episode is number 3, where the landscape gets more and more alien as time goes on. It is incredible to think of Greek armies in the monsoons of the tropics! There are downsides, though. I would have preferred more panoramic views. It is rather dissatifying to see the place of the Battle of Issus, without having time to actually look at the place. Just a brief sweep of the landscape would have been enough. Also, the amount of detail is uneven. Only two battles were covered in any depth. I would have preferred to have more, and in greater detail. It would have been more exciting to the viewer. One of my favourite parts is where Michael Wood is talking to nomad horsemen in Central Asia. They still remember Alexander's conquest!"
4,"Great visuals, limited content","The typical documentary of eras before photography struggles for visuals, using blurred reenactments and photographs of artifacts that often add little to the narrative. The novel approach of ""Footsteps"" makes for compelling viewing. But the content is far too focused on the details of the journey itself. There's very little about Alexander's childhood and almost nothing almost the historical context or consequences of his conquests. A great adventure that left me a bit frustrated."
4,Warts and all,"Having read the book of the same name I was prepared to be dissapointed by the DVD but instead found an interesting and consistent companion to the book, Alexander - warts and all. One complements the other."
3,Nice... but disapponting!,"Very interresting look at the geography of Alexander's expedition (it's a change from books). The cultural view is good also. But don't look for much historical facts. Legends, folklore and heresay are what you'll find here. Being a fan of military history, strategy and tactics... this was not the best I've seen."
2,Get their earlier vinyl releases... this album is blah.,"It was such a downer when this CD came out after the last two EP releases on Dumb-Unit and Festplatten. Some bands start out raw and weak then progress, here I think The Uncut did just the opposite. Actually, their earlier material was rather raw and minimal (very similar to early New Order both in guitar work and vocal delivery). If you can find a way to buy or download their ""Understanding The New Violence"" vinyl EP or the ""Devotion/Fluent And Pure/Over The Edge"" EP, please do for they indeed rock! Certainly their earlier sound is evident in the track ""Understanding the New Violence,"" so if you like how that song sounds, go for the earlier material by this band that had a lot of potential before muddying things up."
2,"Repetitive, good 'background music'","I bought this cd after hearing the second half of 'understanding the new volience' on TV (yes, Muchmusic does play indie bands on it's network every leap year)and purchased the album thinking it would be more driven by guitar riffs. The problem is that it tends to be a bit repetitive (especially the single)and it straddles that uneasy fence between 'pop dance music sound' and rock. Also, the vocalists style of muttering the lyrics as opposed to singing them also adds to the cd's misgivings. If you're into the types of bands that make up the bulk of Paperbag Records artists than you won't be disappointed, but for those of want a more harder and complex rock album look elsewhere"

5,Wedge Pillow,"Good quality. Very happy with the product. I have esophageal problems and need to keep my head highly elevated while sleeping. The wedge pillow is firm, but I use a soft standard pillow on top of it. It is high and may be uncomfortable for some people, but it works well for me. I would suggest purchasing the optional washable pillow cover for it."
3,Just Okay,"I haven't bought any other wedges, so I don't have anything else to compare this product too, but I think its just okay. It's quite a bit firmer than I expected and, as it turns out, I tried it a few times and haven't used it in a while."
4,Good Overview of a Great Writer,"I first discovered Nick Tosches when Creem magazine published his essay on Wynonie Harris way back when I was a kid. I have been a fan ever since. His writing is highly stylized. Imagine a hard boiled crime writer waxing eloquently on rhythm and blues, the mob, and boxing and you have a taste of Tosches. This book contains the sentence ""It was like slipping wilbur into a thermos full of hot oysters."" That alone makes it worth the purchase price.I turn to Tosches' work again and again, for insights into music, and just for fun. Buy this book and you will too."
5,A writers writers writers writers livers writers life,"Read this, and then get all his other books. Die Happy.This is power writing of the kind we need more of. Tosches' gift is an ability to look in the places where the stupid assumptions that cover things over say don't look, and then to say it sensuously, joyously, marvelously, with accuracies of his own making.Read this, then get all his other books. Live Happy."
4,Good for people who want to change up their total gym workout.,"Not a bad buy. Very long. It does break down the exercises into small segments, but I was wanting something easier and faster. Tons of exercises."
4,good record,"I was a fan of the teeth long before I ever heard carry the wood. they are a great, great band live and this is a good companion to those shows, but this record and their live shows are very different. Live they are very much a rock band (you could almost describe them as pub rock). with carry the wood the songs have very different arrangements. there's accordian, lots and lots of acoustic guitar, piano, horns, sleepy vocal harmonies and a whole lot of space in the arrangements. everything is so laid back it's like there was a gas leak in that barn they recorded in (not necessarily a bad thing by any means). One of the songs sounds like a long lost skip spence tune. Only the hidden track has the energy of their concerts. But it IS a very, very good record and I enjoy listening to it. THE END"
2,Poorly done would not recommend,"Full of Cliche' themes (possessed house, spirit possession, psychotic protagonist twist) making it difficult and annoying to follow. Mystery of the house alluded to but never explained. Basically, couple moves into their ancestral home an re-enacts a prior murder. No real haunting and no real mystery."
5,"If my son loves it, I do too!","My 13 month old has had his original Taggie around since he was born. He has loved the tags from day one. We didn't really let him have it overnight until he was about 6 months old. When he was about 10 months old, he began to look for it. At about 11-12 months old, he couldn't be without it. We are approaching 14 months old and we decided that we needed a backup in case one got lost. This purchase was the backup. When he sees it, he lets out a little giggle and a BIG smile. Great product."
4,My 2 1/2 yr old daughter loves it.,My daughter loves it. She has to fight for the tv with her older sisters just to get to play it.
5,Very good,"These dried apricots are so fresh, soft and yummy! When I opened the package, I was amazed by the great smell. Highly recommend!"
1,Straw to the cup broke open second time it was used,"I purchased several Nuby sippy cups a few weeks ago for my kids. I was very pleased at the different styles, that there were no cartoon characters on the sides and the price - as well as the fact they are made out of the BPA free material. However, after just two uses, the straw cup straw ripped open along the seam. I was very disappointed that the product didn't hold up even for a few uses! However, the sippy cups I also purchased are my major concern. The sippy portions of these cups are missing pieces of plastic - where they form the nipple portion of the sippy non-leak. My daughter does chew - however, she's used Gerber and Playtex sippy cups for years now with no problems and I switched due to the new findings of BPA. However, I am very disappointed and concerned that after so few uses, she may have swallowed pieces of plastic because the product did not hold up. I will search elsewhere for BPA free cups that hold up."
1,Leaks a lot,"I bought this as a no handle alternative to the Nuby grip n sip, but have now thrown the all away. Lid is hard to get on properly, hard to get off, and leaks from the lid now matter how I put it on. Not recommended."
1,These leak,"When I first bought these I loved them so I bought 2 more. They were great - no leaks. I have only hand washed them. All of a sudden the tops started to leak to the point that when tipped over the drink runs out of them. I tried to contact the company but no contact info is available on the website. When I tried to return to Babies R Us they would not take them back b/c I did not have the original packaging, eventhough I did have my receipt.I have also talked with several of my friends and we have all had the same problem after about a month of use."
1,Hard to assemble,"If the sliding lid were slightly shorter, then you could easily thread the straw in place behind the crossguard. But as is, the sliding lid prevents the straw from pushing up into place, so you have to use your finger (or a tool like pliers if your hands are too big) to pull the mouthpiece between the sliding lid and the crossguard. This becomes tedious the very first time you wash the cups, and it really never gets easier. And what parent wants another frustration in their day, especially when the little one is begging for their drink?Also, everyone else who complained about the ""spray effect"" when the lid is opened is spot on. These cups are a PAIN."
4,The good and the bad,"I both loved and hated this sippy. It definitely served it's purpose. My twins never had a bottle, so they didn't know you had to tip up the sippy. I gave them this straw sippy before a ""regular"" type of sippy. I never had any transition problems. They were drinking from it within the same day I introduced it.I HATE cleaning it. You have to take it apart and make sure you get all the milk out of all three straw pieces. Running them through the dishwasher didn't seem to work, I usually soaked them in vinegar water and then rinsed really well. As soon as they were capable, I switched to regular sippies and gave these straw ones away.They served their purpose, and I would TOTALLY recommend this cup if you are having problems getting your toddler on a sippy, but unless there is a better way to clean it, it's not a long term cup for me!(Oh, I had very few leaks with this cup.)"
1,"CONTAINS BPA in straw assembly! Shoots contents, and your kid will chew the straw.","This cup's straw assembly includes a BPA part, so it wouldn't be legal in Canada. I have no idea why it's in Amazon's BPA-free store.Also, I bought one of these for my son before I knew Nuby's abysmal BPA record and campaign of misinformation to consumers. I noticed that my son always chewed the straw (the silicone part, not the BPA part which is inside). One day I took a drink of his juice and it turns out you have to bite the straw to get liquid out.Also, when the child has taken a drink and snapped the lid closed, the straw, upon reopening, will shoot a notable amount of beverage toward and above the opener.I threw ours out."
1,Awful! Leaks terribly!,"I just bought this cup and gave it to my daughter this morning - with milk in it. Should have tried just water first. The cup was tipped over on the carpet and was laying in a huge puddle of milk! I took it into the kitchen, held it over the sink, and milk poured out of the straw. I took the cup apart and put all the pieces back together with the same result. It was literally like pouring milk out of a straw. Don't waste your money."
3,Wish I could give it 5 stars.,"Finally a cup that doesn't leak. If it weren't for the zillion pieces (okay, 3 straw pieces) it takes to put together I would be thrilled with this cup."
3,"Work okay, but a real pain to clean","This cups work just fine for my kids. They can get a drink without it spilling or leaking. But, I had to tell them not to open the straw, because it would make a mess each time they opened and closed it. No big deal if it is just water, but really annoying if they have something else in their cups. These cups are also really annoying to clean. I wouldn't buy these again, but if you are really concerned about leaking, I can see how they'd work."
1,no spill = no water,imy daughter throw this after sucking so hard and still no water coming out. i tried it too and i was so dissapointed!!! really a waste of money!!!
4,"Great, spill-proof sippy cups!","Out of all the straw sippy-cups we've tried, these leak the LEAST! I actually can leave a full Nuby sipper with water in my son's crib at night and it doesn't spill or leak. This is great because he often wants a sip of water during the night. I agree that you have to make sure they are twisted on correctly, and they tend to warp in the dishwasher (even on the top shelf), but other than that, I would recommend them."
1,somewhat cheap,"my son loves these cups, but they are difficult to clean, they get moldy fast and he easily chews the rubber straw off. I had to purchase 10 on here because he destroys them so quickly. Also, he has smashed a could just throwing them and the actual bottle breaking. But because he loves them so much I have to keep buying lol."
1,Worst Sippy Cup Ever,In the effort to show our 23 month old daughter how to use a straw we figured this sippy cup would be great. We purchased it yesterday and she absolutely loved it! She enjoyed using the flip top for the straw and thoroughly enjoyed using it...until...she dropped it by accident and the bottom shattered into a gaping hole. We had the cup less than 24 hours and it was completely destroyed. THESE CUPS ARE NOT DURABLE AT ALL!!!
1,LEAKS!!!,"Very Poor Quality for a ""Nuby"" product. I expected better. See pictures above. I am very disgusted with this product."
2,"Some good, mostly bad.","The straw on this is great and the straw doesnt spill easily.The lid is what has ruined this cup for us.Everyone on here has been saying you have to assemble right or put the top on right buut no matter how many times I put the top on,it always leakes.If it falls over or is tipped to far to the side it starts leaking.I gave up on these and went back to Playtex which are leak proof and you can use any top for any cup(straw, sippy, bottle type will all switch with eachother)."
3,Really good construction with two major flaws,"So I really like this cup. Stores a lot and the assembly is very cool. Two major issues:1. the straw is in three parts. the bottom part ALWAYS gets lost. So of the three cups we bought, we had one functioning one.2. I think it's because the cup is airtight, but the straw very frequently fills with milk (or whatever liquid is in the cup). So when you flip the top, it sprays milk.Other than that though, it's a nice cup."
1,Terrible cup,this cup is next to impossible to put together after you take it apart. i returned mine to the store.
2,PITA!!!,"So, I started my infant on these around 9 months old. They work great if your child doesn't understand that they need to tip the cup up to drink from it. (My son is now almost 12 months and still isn't great at this) So I thought, perfect, he can drink from any angle. Well, I only use these with water because he is constantly flicking the straw which holds a small amount of liquid in the top (it doesn't flow back down the valve). So after having formula flying everywhere...the stroller, car, kitchen wall, my face, etc... I got fed up with it. He only gets water because it won't cause a stain when he plays with the straw or sets it down too hard. Any other type of liquid, and he gets a normal sippie cup and we are working on teaching him to tip it up so he doesn't just suck air. Not sure I would have tried these had I researched them before buying a few at the local store."
2,Hard to part with them . . .,"First let me say that my son LOVED these cups. He would never take a traditional sippy cup and these were his favorite. They weren't the easiest to clean and put together, but I tolerated it because my son loved them so much. We recently had to part with them because they do contain BPA. Although none of the components that ""touch the liquid"" come in contact with the BPA parts (straw flip-cover), my son would sometimes chew/suck on the knob of the flip cover if he wasn't looking when he put it to his mouth. According to Nuby's website, all of these particular staw cups manufactured after 4/18/08 are 100% BPA free. If I can be guaranteed those are the ones I was purchasing, I would consider it - if not, we've moved on to the Playtex Baby Einstein Sip & Discover Straw Cup - which depsite some reviews, are 100% BPA free.Playtex Baby Einstein 9oz. Insulated Straw Cup"
2,worst sippy straw ever,"I bought these to have a sport type cup for my daughter that held more especially for trips. She is already used to straws. I didn't realize how many no leak valves the straw had, there is one too many. A child has to bite on the straw in order to sip. She got frustrated, and wouldn't use it. I ended up cutting out the valve inside the straw so she would use it. If you want a straw sippie I like the Gerber Cool Twisties much better. Very easy to take apart and put back together, the straw pieces won't fall out of the silverware basket.Cool Twisties Cup - 9 oz - OuterspaceFriends have had good luck with the Munchkin cup too.Munchkin Go Diego Go Insulated Spill Proof Straw Cups 3/Pk -Boys"
2,"PRO: easy open, CONS: reassembly of straw.....","PRO: easy open, CONS: reassembly, valve is located at end of straw which gets chewed on (be prepared to order several replacement straws), FIVE COMPONENTS (short clear straw, white sturdy straw (which depending on the model may no fit newer cups), ""silicone"" straw, cup and lid), flying liquid when opened...."
2,"Spill, leak resistant, not proof","Seems my 20 mo old toddler has found a way for this one to leak fairly easily. He just turns it upside down and shakes or bangs on the table. It is fine for most applications though. We took this one on our last flight and water started coming, squirting out under cabin pressure, so not good for flying."
2,Bad design!,"This cup leaks like crazy, my baby's clothes are always wet when drinking from this cup, it looks fancy but don't be fooled. FYI he's 14 months and knows how to drink from a sippy or straw sippy cup. We have a different one we bought from target, no problem with leak whatsoever. And like some one else said, to wash it is another pain..."
2,Exploding Cups,These work fairly well as a straw cup and we used them for about a year with our daughter. But they leak/spray almost every time you open them and they frequently EXPLODE as the liquid inside gets slightly warmer. The pressure builds inside the cups and after only a minute or two out of the refrigerator they start spitting milk/liquid everywhere. They are very messy and the straw is made of 3 separate pieces so they are hard to keep clean and easy to lose parts.
2,A pain to put together and it sprays when you flip it open,"The straw is actually in three pieces and the smallest part always gets misplaced. It took me quite a while to get the clear flexible straw into the lid the first time and a couple of months later it's still a pain. As others have said, it sprays all over the place when you flip it open. I learned the hard way when milk was sprayed all over the back seat of my car. Now I just use the cup for water."
1,Really Disappointed,"I really loved the smaller version of this product for my daughter, so I automatically thought the larger one would be just as great. Turns out that it's pretty much the same top from the smaller one with a small insert to make up the difference in height. Unfortunately I lost that insert the first time I washed it and now the cup is almost useless. It would have been better if they just made it one longer piece.I also found the straw very difficult to pull through the top as the slide closure didn't seem to go as far back as it should.Since my 20-mth old really liked the smaller one, I really am disappointed that she can't use the bigger one."
2,Designed to Break,"I've had two of these cups. I really liked the cup when I first tried it and bought a second one. My son was able to drink from it easily and it didn't leak (at first). After having it a couple of months, I hate it. I've lost one of the straw parts and a new straw costs nearly as much as a new cup. The top piece of the straw is very difficult to assemble correctly. It's very difficult to get water out unless you bite the straw, but then it's not durable enough to withstand repeated biting. Now there is a hole in the straw and it leaks. I can't get the straw to fit in quite right, and it leaks. These all seem to be design flaw issues. At least with the munchkin straw sipper, if you need a new straw they are cheap and readily available. I would not recommend this cup."
2,Leaks galore!,"I bought this cup because of its promises to not leak and for the straw feature, however after a few uses by my little one this thing was leaking all over the floor. It was leaking from the lid area and from the straw - really made a mess of my floors, furniture and car!"
3,Not good for flingers,"My son, almost 2, has figured out that if he flicks the straw the milk trapped above the no-spill ""valve"" will be flung all over the place. So he drinks a little then flings milk everywhere! I also found this a pain to put back together after a thorough cleaning."
1,These LEAK like crazy!,"The liquid just pours right out. If you're looking for a cup w/ a straw, the Playtex Insulator Sports cups work really well."
2,hard to clean...,"very hard to assemble after cleaning, unless you want to clean it assembled which is not a good idea."
1,LEAKS Everywhere!!!!,I have 3 of these cups and they all leak. The lastest one I just bought leaks all of the liquid out within seconds of it being on it's side. It would be less messy if I just gave my daughter a regular cup. Total waste of money! A real disappointment since my daughter really loves these cups.
4,not sure...,"I switched to Nuby products when my son was about 9months old and started holding his own bottles. Love Dr. Browns but they don't hold up to a 9mo. old boy who spikes the bottle when finished. Needed something that didn't leak in the car when he dropped it. These were the perfect solution. Loved the bottles, liked the sippy cups, and I did love the straw cups but I was wondering how dishwasher safe they are. They didn't leak at all in the beginning, other than the drop that stays in the tip. But now they leak all of the time! I've been using the straw cups for 5 months now and I think I have to start over again. It's very frutrating!!The straws are a pain to thread correctly but so worth it when they don't leak. I use my dr. browns tiny brush to clean the inside of all my straws, works perfectly. Replacemnt parts are hard to come by but starting to be more widely available."
1,No leak?? HUAHUAHUAHUA...yeah right,"BEWARE BUYERS, THIS THING LEAKS ALL THE TIME!!!all of the nuby products I bought leaks all of it content whenever it's on its side, so that means, leaks when it tips over in the diaper bag, and when the baby drinks the bottle.Such a waste of money!"
2,Leaks something awful!,"We had the smaller, two handle version of this cup so I picked up these thinking they would be great. These leak like no ones business! My kids can toss the two handle ones all over and besides the little spray from the straw sometimes, they don't leak. These left a good 8"" puddle on the floor after less than 5 minutes. I much prefer the Playtex Click n Lock straw cups."
4,LOVE THIS CUP,"my daughter is 14 months and loves these cups. she started out on the nuk learner cup and loved it but when she got a little older we couldn't get her to take any other cup. she couldn't grasp the concept of tilting the cup to get the liquid. i started noticing at around ten months she kept wanting to drink out of the straws on juice boxes, of course that wasn't practical so i went out on a limb and got this cup because it had a straw. she loved it and started drinking out of them immediately. i have about 4 of these and 2 of the insulated version. they are all great. she loves them. there is a little liquid that comes out of the straw when she throws it down but we have wood floors so its not really a big deal."
5,No spills!,My daughter loves to take her bottles and cups and turn them upside down bumping them on the table trying to make a mess. This is the one cup that she hasn't been able to do that with. It does take a bit of finagling to get it together but it is worth it!
2,Disappointing,"I love charms and charm bracelets but this book was so disappointing to me. There were some interesting facts but, overall, it was just too much celebrity worship for me (although the photos of Grace Kelly and Helena Rubenstein were wonderful)and not enough passion about the subject they were supposed to be addressing. I realize the co-author, John Ayton, is the co-owner - with his wife - of Links of London but this book was so much payola for his own business. If you really love charm jewelry skip this book and get ""Charmed Bracelets"" by Tracey Zabar. You'll be glad you did."
5,Chevron - The best fuel cleaner on the planet!,"I generally do not like putting additives on my car since but Chevron is an exception. If your are experiencing knocking, pinging just pour this stuff before you fuel and fill it up with gas. This magical synthetic formula does the trick! This also reduces your cars apetite for higher octane by cleaning the fuel chambers, piston etc.Completely recommended for your car!"
1,"This does not work, Dont believe these fake reviews","This product did not improve my mileage what so ever, I track my mileage for every trip i make. It did not restore any type of engine power what so ever, Then again, My engine could have been fine in the first place. But im saying i saw no improvement in anything this product claimes to improve,Then again, Its made by chevron, They dont make quality products what so ever, There gas stations are all almost out of business, When is the last time you saw a chevron?Also i saw this product at pep boys, oreily autoparts, on sale for 10-15 bucks, buy 1 get 1 free, roughly the same size, Also, you shouldnt need to apply this more than once, My ford manual suggest i dont put these faulty additives in my tank as it may damage the engine.The price for this is rediculous, i dont recommend this product. beware"
1,Notice no difference.,"I tried this out, twice as per the instructions. Didnt make much difference at all. Should have just kept my $20."
5,The best Fuel Injector Cleaner Around,"I added one bottle to my tank one day because the reviews were so good..I figured I give it a try. The first bottle I noticed a difference in the acceleration and on the highway. About a month later I added a second bottle and there was huge difference....The call drives like brand new....It's Amazing!I have never added Fuel Additives but I recently tried Lucas and this...And I feel this product is the real deal...I recently took a road trip recently and was able to get up to 450 miles on one tank of gas....It was hard for me to believe that I could go that far on a tank of gas..I usually get not even 300 miles. That's going from 23 MPG to about 34 MPG....Granted I was doing 90% highway miles and my car has a highway rating of 30..but it's still unbelievable. I am going to say everyone is going to see the same results..but ""hey you never know""."
2,No difference after use....,"I'm no stranger to these products, yet I had never used this brand b4. I heard a lot about it on BMW/MERCEDES forums, so I figured I try it. My C class seemed sluggish & since I had ran out of gas 1x , I figured this would clean/ flush out my system & give me my performance back. Didn't happen. Whole bottle & I didn't notice ANY difference . I have had good results with other products ie, ""Lucas"", ""NOS"" octane boost racing formula etc. This may work for some, but it did nothing for my car."
2,Ultimately Unsatisfying,"I appreciate Anderson's interest in SF and his desire to make it real by placing this novel in the hear and now. But like so many SF novels, this one simply ends. You read, you get excited, you hope for a miracle, you get a flat ending. All the promise developed in the characters, including the Alien, simply fades away. Actually, I forgot this book the day after I read it."
5,Christi is the best!,"If I could rate it higher than 5 stars I would. Christi Taylor is the best instructor bar none. I have 6 of her videos and there is no one comparable. Her workouts are so much fun they are a joy and so is she. I have been doing exercise videos for 10 years and believe me, there's no one around like her. From her impeccable cuing to her outstanding choices of music to her tough but not frustrating choreography, Christi is simply awesome!"
2,Battery access is very difficult,"To install/change the battery, you need a tiny tiny phillips screwdriver (not included, of course). After finally getting the battery into this thing, I simply could not get it all together for a tight seal. It works, barely, it is not nearly as loud as I thought it would be. It would perhaps scare off a kid intending mischief but some druggie attacker would simply shrug it off."
4,Mace 3 in 1 Strobe Alarm - Too Cool,"Great device. Bought it for a daughter moving away for school. Compact design, very loud! Strobe could be a little larger but all in all a great little device."
3,you will find your reflection in it,"i'm one of those people the series calls ""orthodox Christians"", theologically conservative, and knowledgable about many of the issues they talk about.the show strikes me as a bit arrogant to assume that their particular viewpoint is widely shared, it isn't, but rather is restricted to academics and theologically liberal churches. but i supposed when they count noses on the issues, these are the only people whose opinions or noses count. sadly, it is not a unbiased presentations but rather the current state of the art for a specific theological tradition.but if you can stomach the documentary hypothesis, Q, and the principle that prophecy is impossible so if a document mentions X that it must have been written after event X has occurs, there is some value to watching it."
1,A condescending treatment of Christianity,"The main problem with this documentary is that it begins with the premise that Christ was not the Son of God. As a result, the series dismisses the New Testament as a source and then comes up with lots of alternative explanations for why Christianity developed. If you are a skeptic about Christianity, then this documentary may be for you, but if you are a Christian, this documentary will tell you very little about early Christianity and will take lots of cheap shots at your faith."
1,Yet Another Liberal View,"I have always enjoyed Frontline video series. I thought their piece on the Gulf War was one of the best I've ever seen. However, this series was so slanted towards the left that it left me utterly disgusted. They only interview scholars from notoriously liberal divinity schools who give a completely tainted few of the truth! I suppose this makes for good television and avoids the more controversial black and white issues of the Christian faith (i.e. The one true way to God), but I call it blasphemy."
4,early christianity,"It's an excellent overview of the time of Christ, and the early beginnings of what became Christianity. Instead of the usual larger than life context of most present day accounts, it attempts to imagine the time and now iconic figures as it and they most likely were."
4,Recommended,"I enjoyed the documentary, watched it over 4 nights because there are 4 parts. The last part was by far the most interesting, I wish they'd devolve into the effects of Stoicism more. Watching a movie for me was far more enriching than a textbook. Only complaint is that the video repeated the same photos/scenes over and over. I understand there's not much to work with from the time of Jesus but I think they could have varied it a bit more. Still, I recommend the documentary to anyone interested in early Christianity or the metamorphosis of the Roman Empire."
4,A good introduction.,"For anyone seeking the beginnings of the Christian faith this is a great start. Good overview, detailed historical accounts, beautiful vistas."
4,Academic view on Jesus,"Elaine Pagels is, in my opinion, one of the leading authorities on the subject matter. I first saw this air on TV and have had many discussions on the various gospels as well as those found in Nag Hamadi. I am a seeker and thus am always on the hunt for answers of how and why. This documentary attempts, very well, to answer some of those questions most of us have. This does not attempt to rattle questions of faith and if your faith can be easily rattled I don't suspect you would be watching this documentary anyway."
2,An unbalanced and therefore misleading review of scholarship,"This video series is a good introduction to the scholarship of the third quest for the historical Jesus and specifically of the so-called Jesus seminar. Unfortunately, that scholarship is at one end of the spectrum and is fairly controversial. What this series fails to do is to seriously consider the evidence and arguments of scholars who hold less radical viewpoints and who have raised serious objections to the kinds of claims made in the series. For a brief example of such scholarly objections, see http://www.ntwrightpage.com/Wright_Five_Gospels.pdfFor more complete treatments see:Fabricating Jesus: How Modern Scholars Distort the GospelsWhat Have They Done with Jesus?: Beyond Strange Theories and Bad History--Why We Can Trust the BibleorDethroning Jesus: Exposing Popular Culture's Quest to Unseat the Biblical Christto name a few."
4,jesus to christ,this is a very good overview of Christanity. I help a person christian or not to understant the development of the Chistian religion.
2,slick and pretty...disturbing,"I bought this video set believing that I would get a good, non-biased historical documentary on the original Christians. Instead, I was surprised to see the Jesus Seminar scholars so prominently featured bringing ""new evidence"". Atheists will love this portrayal of Jesus because it is based on a group whose ""research"" begins with the premise that the Bible is largely myth. All of the commentary is colored in this direction which makes for a completely lopsided presentation. I'm shocked that absolutely no effort was made to bring on any New Testament/Early Christian scholars that would provide a kind of foil or balanced point of view. The info in this video represents a miniscule (<5%) viewpoint in the Christian study and has been widely discredited -- even by Atheist scholars. If you're gonna see this stuff, at least read something like Lee Strobel's ""A Case For Christ"" for a complete picture."
3,Can't view the product,"In Australia we can view only PAL DVDs. As the DVD was NTSC, I am unable to view it. I should have inquired before I bought the DVD. I'll know next time to check the format."
3,My summary is about what I thought of this book.,"I think that this book was pretty good, but I personally like to have plenty of romance and adventure, which wasn't shown much in this book. I did like story though because it was interesting and different from Caroyln Keene's other Nancy Drew books."
4,A Very Good Book.,"'0n Her 0wn' is a very worth while book. I really recommend it. If you have not read any books in this series, I suggest that you do. -J.C.P"
4,George of the Jungle Soundtrack Review,"If you're a George Of the Jungle fan,this is a must have.All of the songs on there are great.I hope you enjoy the the album as much as I do."
4,"MMMM, Smoky","Love the smoker box, my chips took half the time to begin to smoke, and seemed to be a bit more intense. Wish it was a bit deeper to allow for more chips.About an hour in to the heat being on the box, one of the corners cracked from the corner stand hole to the top of the smoker. The box has been used since without issues."
3,Works okay...but it broke,"Well used it today for the first time. At first I looked at it I thought oh nice 'its made of cast iron' I was certain it would outlast my cheap bbq pro grill (got it for $50 on sale!).Well I put in some wood chips (soaked in water for 30 mins, and tossed it in the 'Charbroil O2 Smoker' placed the smoker on my coals (I use lump charcoal - burns hotter, low ash, natural).Anyway, I was cooking with the dome off, and the wood chips caught fire; I put the dome on and closed off the vents. After a 30 seconds smoke starts leaking out (indicates the fire is gone out) I lift the dome the fire starts up again and I hear a crack. Turns out the smoker broke in 2 pieces. Didnt expect that from cast iron, but for the 30 minute duration that it did work, it was great.It most probably broke because of the intense heat from the chips catching on fire. So you should be fine if you can get rid of the flames quick enough."
3,Not that good,Not absorbent for my taste. I replaced the weight as well so that I could use it over my lap without it falling to the floor constantly.
5,This CD is a trip on memory lane.,"This CD has a collection of the Original Walt Disney World theme park music from 1972-1991. This is when it was only two Theme Parks and the park passes were a lot cheaper. One reason why I love this CD, when Walter Cronkite narrated spaceship earth from 86-96 the song they played in the background was Tomorrow's Child. Before the Lion King Puppet show, I remember the 3D Movie Magic Journey's in Fantasyland. So Everytime I listen to this CD, I feel like I a kid again. I recommend this CD to anyone who has been to Walt Disney World and experience all the rides and attractions in Magic Kingdom and Epcot in the 70's and 80's."
4,Where is the video for 'Seabeast'?,"This is the most complete set of Mastodon footage to date. I really love this band. Their music is hard rock progressive. Lots of change-ups with jazz school drumming. These guys are several tokes over the line. The lead singer is silly. I was dissappointed that they left the video for 'Seabeast' out. It is my favorite song by them to date. They have 'Seabeast' live, but the sound quality is lacking. This is the reason why I'm only giving this DVD 4 stars. As for Mastodon, they are a 5 star band all the way. Check them out."
3,I have a PBS tape and love it,"Im buying this set, because I have the one from sacramento he did years ago. I go back to his tape over and over again. He is a funny guy, and it is just fun to watch him.I don't care if I don't even see this set, because I know he will be motivating! I gave it 3 stars because I havn't seen it yet, but will review it after it comes."
2,"Been There, Done That","A poor rehash of the Companion. Fans who have that book memorized will get a sense of deja vu from this tome. Not enough hard work went into this piece of literature, and the cover price is way too high to justify. Trust me, take a pass."
1,This book -really- stinks!,"DO NOT listen to the three ""4 star"" reviews posted by the same person (probably the author, the only person that could like this horrid work). If someone offered me a copy of this book for FREE, I would not walk 100 yards to pick it up. What a waste of paper..... SERIOUSLY!! I wish we had ZERO stars as an option, because that is what this deserves!"
2,An over-priced paperback.,"I bought the hardcover for this book a number of years ago for less than what this pb is going for. The book is a rehash of any number of episode guides for the classic series. At 288 pages the price($30) is incredibly high. If spending a large amount for a paperback book I'd advise going with ""Twilight Zone: Unlocking the Door to a Television Classic"" at least it was interesting and at over 800 pages it was worth it."
4,"Actually, it hasn't been done","Must disagree with the 1 review of the Twilight Zone Book. While the Zicree ""Companion"" is incisive, it fails to mention the lost Zone episodes which surfaced on television in the 80s ... the Presnell book does ... and well. The ""Critical History"" is in-depth and well written. Rehash it isn't as it uses for its source the original scripts. Well worth a look."
2,bad receiver function,"I bought the ex-d5 as an upgrade to my jvc yx-d1. Although the wood cone speakers in the d5 are terrific, the fm/am reception is terrible. The unit was placed in same spot and same antenna as previous unit, and every station is static-filled. No wonder jvc couldnt sell 'em."
2,Great Features; Mediocre Sound,"This unit had all the features I wanted: DVD/CD player; compact size; and USB connectivity. This is a great unit for small spaces but has many drawbacks:First, older CDs do not have the best sound on this system. I played The Stooges Fun House and David Bowie and the Spiders From Mars albums and the sound is reduced to transistor radio mode. Also, the wood cone speakers make a lot of music sound odd and ""tinny or metallic"". Very weird. On the other hand, classical music and DVDs sound terrific (though the dialog is often too quiet).Second, the unit itself is very noisy during disc play. A whirring noise, like a motor humming, can be heard when a disc is playing. This gets very annoying while you're trying to watch a movie or listen to music on lower volumes. Maybe this was just a lemon and I got unlucky -- but I've had the same problem with another JVC microsystem.I ended up returning the system, and it will be my last purchase from JVC."
4,JVC EXD 5 Mini Stereo,haven't used this new one yet - but the previous one (detroyed in a fire) was fantastic. Great sound from a small speaker and ran flawlessly for many years
2,"Good design, Poor reliability","The good: this system is great for a portable system. I used it in conjunction with a powered subwoofer. The sound is very good. DVD is hooked up to computer LCD monitor. Works very well. Lots of function in a nice little package.The bad: the receiver lasted a little over a year, then failed. - could play CD or DVD for 10 minutes or so, then the big static noise and would not response further. I used it a lot during the year that it operated, but i expect the thing to last a little longer, and not just fail soon after basic warranty expires."
5,refranes de la mar,es un excelente compendio de refranes y leyendas y anecdotas marineras. tengo dificultad para ordenar una copia usada ya que Argentina no figura entre los paises posibles de seleccionar durante el encargue. favor de avisarme como encargar uno usado.marcelo
2,No English subtitles,"I bought this DVD and it arrives in great condition. However, the details distinctly said there was English subtitles, but there is not. The advertisements are in English, but the film is in Hindi only and there's no captions, and there isn't English subtitles - I tried the DVD in two different DVD players. If you need English subtitles, I wouldn't recommend this DVD although it seems interesting. The details say it's a 2 disc movie, but there was one DVD in the box. Box was new, unopened. Fail."
4,deepening,"This book has truly taken me to a new level of confidence in prayer, faith and trusting God without works. My pastis son recommend this book after stating how it drastically impacted his life. All I can say is WOW...EVERY BELIEVER SHOULD READ THIS BOOK!"
2,Not very good..,I always hate doing this to my own brethren but I couldn't even get through the first chapter. Poorly written and confusing.
2,disappointed,"I thought this was a book with actual prayers in it but it is more of a teaching on prayer. It wasn't what I was looking for. Even looking inside the book in advance didn't give me enough information to discover this. In my opinion, the advertisement is misleading. The teaching is fine but it just wasn't what I was looking for."
2,"good as a novelty, falls short as an assistive device","I bought this clock for my Dad to replace an older failing clock.Unfortunately, this clock is too small and the voice quality is poor.Volume is lacking as well. I cannot recommend this clock for someonewith a handicap or impairment."
4,smaller than I thought it would be,Clock is smaller than I thought it would be but it seems good so far. The voice is pleasant and easily understandable.
2,Disappointed,"I ordered this clock for my father-in-law, who has glaucoma and is legally blind. I was very disappointed in the size of this clock, it is very small. Also, the clock does not announce the date with the time. You have to push a small round button on top to get it to actually announce the date. I would not recommend this clock for the visually impaired."
4,Decent,"I've used this alarm clock for almost a year and and I am mostly happy with it. The four alarms are very useful, I use two in a row for work (in case I hit snooze, the next one goes off a minute later) and still have two left for weekend or a second person.The female voice is not overly synthesized and pronounces everything well. It is much nicer to wake to the voice then the jolting beep of most other alarm clocks.The only downside of this and any other LCD alarm clock is you cannot see the time in the dark, without hitting the large button on top to hear the spoken time and turn on the backlight. Unfortunately there is no way to keep the backlight on longer than the speech or holding the button.Despite using the alarm every day, after nearly a year I am still on the original set of 4 AAA batteries!"
4,Works well save for the nightly reports,I purchased this clock for my elderly blind mom. She would constantly call me on my phone asking for the time. Or she would turn on her radio and tune to a station that would offer the time. This clock does a great job giving hourly reports on the time and there is a button she can press to give her the exact time. I wish the button on the clock was bigger so she would not be so reticent to use it since their are other buttons on the clock and she seems scared to press any by mistake and mess up the clock.One issue I have with the clock is that the clock makes hourly reports at night as well. In the packaged instructions it listed it would not make hourly time announcements between 12 am and 6 am but it does and that can be at times annoying though my mom has not complained.
5,GOOD BOOK,"It has some thrilling parts, and you don't want to put the book down. Some sad parts but those sad parts only perk your interest in the book. It is an awesome sequal to The Demon Awakens and though it is shorter it is about 10 times better than. Elbryan, Pony, and Roger are all loveable characters in this book."
4,Great sequal but.............,"I believe this to be a great book. All books have a flaw or two, though. This book's main flaws were in character actions. The characters made me think of the others as ignorant. Jojonah steal the hematite and leaves. Even De'unerro would have noticed that the stone was not a real hematite when he went for his prized tiger's paw. I would have to say that overall this is a must read for any avid fantasy reader. Now if I could just get my hands on that sequal........."
3,Not his best work but worth reading,"This book's main flaws were the characters, they are your typical cookie cutter action hero that you see in every fanstay. don't get me wrong I enjoyed the book though it wasn not one of Salvators better work.If you enjoy Fantasy then I would recommend The Price of Immortality by C.M. Whitlock, The characters are unique, as is the story"
4,Very Good Continuance to the Demon Wars,"This is a very good sequel to the Demon Wars. It doesn't have the flare and the style of the first book, nor the emotion of the third book but it still stands on its own as a great book. IMO, it is the least significant book of the Demon Wars saga."
3,Demon Spirit,"Salvatore has certainly done better work. My biggest problem with this novel is that I find the whole thing very underwhelming, and the characters fit into this as well. Aside from the acception of a warrior Elf with a somewhat minor role and Bradwarden the Centaur (with an even smaller part to play in the series of events), this book is just somehow lacking - though still, in many ways, a fair fantasy yarn that still feels like it should have... more."
3,Demon Spirit could have been a contender!,"After reading Demon Awakens and half of the Demon Spirit I had high aspirations for the book. The entire saga with the Father Abbot was absolutely magnificent. I only wish the other half of the book was as well thought out. The entire episode with Elbryan leading the rogue band really detracted greatly from what I feel was the real story with the Ablican Church. In addition to this, the story doesn't resolve any of major issues brought up in the book in favor of putting them off until the sequel in the hope of selling more books. Sorry, but if I'm going to spend 25 dollars, I'd rather have the book be 200 pages longer and resolve these issues instead of putting them off. Only a half-hearted approval for this one."
1,Ugh,"I never really liked the Demon Awakening and yet always find myself being driven by wanting to see ""what happens next"", so I figured I'd give the second book a whirl. I think a large problem I find with books like this is that the main character come off more annoying than heroic. You know your not enjoying a fantasy novel when you would like nothing better than to see the main protaganist meet a grisly fate (like squished under the foot of a ""fomorian"" giant). Avelyn was cool but his encore is very dissapointing. Oh, and I really don't give a damn at what angle Nightbird blocked a goblin sword or how many triple sow-cows he does to escape a cumbersome giant axe. yawn."
3,"Great plot, great characters. Great writing?","This book really left me disappointed. I read the first volume in the series quickly and enjoyed it quite a lot. This second book advanced nicely with plot and characters, but the quality of the writing became very poor. I found myself wincing everytime I saw ""He said, dryly."" at the end of a sentence. I didn't even finish the book."
1,Thumbs Down!,"A truly dreadful book. I was amazed at the number of favourable reviews until I noticed that most of them were written by other Del Rey hacks!And if I ever open a tavern, believe me it will NOT be called The Howling Sheila! The Groaning Broad, perhaps?"
4,Skateboarding Shorts,"I use these for skateboarding. I like them very much, they are durable and fit well. A good value."
5,Can't beat Amazon for price,"These Dickies shorts are sooo comfortable and though purchased as work garb, they are very trim looking for other casual wear."
5,Excellent Trading Assistant - eBay Book,This is a fantastic book! It is a very truthful and open approach to this business. Definitely something to take a look at considering all of us could use some extra income in this new economic market. If you are looking for information about the tools and systems you will need to consider if you are going to think about selling other people's stuff ... this is the book to get.
3,"If you have Titanium Ebay from the same author, this book is just a cut and paste work with an extended chapter on consignment","About 85% of the book is in Titanium Ebay, and in the exact same words. Its just cut and paste. If this is your first Skip McGraph book, this is excellent way to start.I love McGraph style, and incisive info on the Ebay business. He tells you insider secrets of PowerSellers, and their tactics. But the best are the cases he makes, examples of what to buy, how to sell it and profit. He opens up your mind that almost everything sells."
4,Enjoyed,"Have the whole series, got hooked on the first one & had to read the rest. My husband & my son also got hooked ;-)"
4,cute but small,"My son wears 3T and 4T clothes and this item doesn't even cover his tummy. It is like 2 inches too short but still stinkin' cute because his belly pokes out. Material is cheap, but so was the costume."
1,Not true to size,"I bought this for my nephew, who is 2, because he loves pirates. The pants had a hole in them, the shirt was way too small. It's not even close to being a 3T/4T. It definitely is not worth $15.00. Very disappointed."
1,4t is was not,Tags said 4t but was more like 2t.So just gave it friend and got a different one.My son was very disappointed.
2,Inexpensive and cheap,"This costume is for my average-ish sized 15 month old who weighs 22lbs. He wears size 18mos clothes comfortably so I thought 2T would suffice, as Halloween is around the corner. The costume size runs small and is cheaply made from cheap material. I wasn't expecting a treasure as it is an inexpensive costume, however, I wasn't expecting to see something that has the same workmanship that I could have produced on my own. Did I mention that I can't sew and wear a patch over my right eye? Additionally the hat that came with it did not fit his below average sized head. Bummer. I recommend that you spend the extra five bucks and buy one that received better reviews. Did I mention that it is cheap?"
4,Great product - no so great service,"The bed is nice, however, information about it was not easily accessible. Babies R Us didnt have it in the store and even the manager couldnt tell me if any of the stores had the bed. Amazon has ZERO information. I called Bassett and after telling me I needed to call Babies R US and going back and forth a few days with no help they gave me the details. The older bed has one solid end and one end with a strip of wood going down the middle. The newer bed has a strip of wood going down both ends. No one knows enough as to which you will receive so be prepared for both. I have the older bed which turns out to be fine.So my review of the bed is good but the service was pretty much terrible!"
5,Amazing Sound for the Size!!,"When I ordered this speaker dock, I wasn't expecting the quality and sound that this unit puts out. When I first hooked up my Sansa player to it, I could not believe the sound that came out of this unit. Needless to say it was much better than I was expecting. The dock is very easy to set up and use with any Sansa player. The unit comes with all the inserts to fit any of the players. The unit can be powered by the included AC adapter cord, or it can be powered by 4 AA batteries (not included). I really like being able to power it with the batteries as you can take it with you anywhere you go. The unit itself has independent on-off and volume controls, and is a great accessory for your Sansa player. The speaker dock it well worth the price, and I would highly recommend to anyone thinking about buying one."
1,My e280 does not fit!,What a disappointment. This is just a glorified plug-in speaker system using the audio jack.
4,SanDisk Sansa Speaker Dock,"I bought this because we have started to use MP3's for our shut-ins at our Church. I like it except I sometimes hook it up correctly and it starts where it's supposed to. At other times it goes all the way back to the beginning. I managed to conquer this problem with my MP3, so I imagine with a little perseverance, I shall conquer this problem also. Otherwise, I really like it. I listen to downloaded books and the sound quality for that is very good."
2,SanDisk Speaker Dock--marginal,"This speaker dock is disappointing for sure. There is loud static when it is turned on. This can even be heard over music sometimes! SanDisk assured me there was something wrong with my device, but the second one had the same issue. The design is also strange, with a plastic piece that precariously rests in place covering the main MP3 hookup cable instead of snaping on. Look elsewhere..."
1,didn't receive,Do not order from this company. I had to call them and all I got was the run around. First they wouldn't give me my money back because they didn't have any then they wouldn't give me back my money. Amazon did a few days later but I wouldn't order again from them.
5,Awesome!,"This Speaker Dock is PERFECT for my Sansa m260 player. It fits perfectly. The size of the Dock is great, smaller than I thought, but perfect; the sound is really amazing and I thought the price very good too. I am VERY happy with this purchase and would definitely recommend it."
1,Disappointment,"The item purchased was delivered in a padded envelope instead of a box with packing material. I guess that is how it got a small chip in the bottom.My main disappontment is the fact that I ordered Eau de Pafume and received the Eau de Toilette. After reading the negative reviews, I decided that I would just keep the purchase and not risk loosing my money (not all of it that is) or having the company not receive the return.I would not use this vendor again"
2,Didn't work for me,"Bought this because I have GERD & doc recommended I elevate head of bed. Rather than do that thought I'd try this pillow. Unfortunately it tends to bend you in the middle instead of elevating your upper body, plus it is very hard. Just not comfortable. Didn't work for me."
3,Pretty Racy Stuff!,"Considering our perception of those prudish days gone by, this one has a pretty racy storyline rife with infidelity, adultery and illegitimacy. Bette Davis is great in the first half, even while Miriam Hopkins emotes wildly like a silent movie actress. Unfortunately, the movie falls apart in the second half and Davis plays everything on one note, with an absurd makeup job that screams out community theatre. We come to expect a gigantic payoff that is never delivered. A disappointment, but not bad rainy afternoon matinee fare."
5,"Bette Davis, how can you go wrong",This was a wonderful addition to my collection. I would recommend any Bette Davis movie to anyone.
3,Coyote Summer,"This book was a satisfying 2nd part conclusion to the 1st book, Morning River. It is not only an action account of life in the wilderness regions of the US during the fur trade, but it also provokes thought about differing life philosophies as seen in the Euro-American and the Native American ideologies."
4,Michael Gear Historian and Storyteller,"Michael Gear is a consumate storyteller who has done is home work in history. This is a work of imagination based on history, folklore,myth, and ledgend. Somewhere near the truth. It is a good read that provides many insights in the the life and times of the American West in the 19th. century."
3,"Content different than other books like it, Hard to read","I read this book for an intro counseling class and it was somewhat hard to read, especially the first few chapters. It does contain a lot of good information, history and perspective of different therapies. It is a good supplement to a more traditional psychotherapy intro book as this one does not go into methodical detail about each therapy. The author does share some personal experiences with different therapies and those are very interesting to read. It is also different in that it briefly introduces eastern philosophies and therapies which is good to help the reader get a broader perspective of the field."
3,Joining the bi-polar review mob,"==== SPOILER WARNING ====My humble haiku assessment of John Wayne's ""Jet Pilot"".....Very good flight scenes. *Story is somewhat hokey. **Commies, Yanks THAT dumb?!? ***-----* - Not surprising, given Howard Hughes made the flick, with the USAF getting third billing in the opening credits - no CGI in those days.** - Meh - boy meets girl, boy defects with spy girl, spy girl defects back for steak?*** - Really? Were they REALLY that dumb? Yes, I know it's entertainment, but that took away from it for me."
2,When the soup hits the fan?,"Ok, it pretty hokey & is one of John Wayne lesser efforts. But the aerial shots are superior. Janet Leigh is a luscious Ruskie spy. John Wayne is a leering Air Force pilot. She gets naked for him, but you'll have to use your imagination.Dumb plot. Apparently the word ""sex"" hadn't been invented in 1950. It's Howard Hughes week & this is his movie. Great pilot & once again the shots of the F-86's in the air are excellent. A great movie maker? Not."
3,"Good movie, not-so-good DVD","Jet Pilot is a good John Wayne film, co-starring Janet Leigh (Psycho) You can tell Wayne is comfortable in his role as Col. James Shannon. Leigh is as beautiful as ever as a Russian pilot, she and Wayne fall in love, but later on General Black reveals shes a spy. Sounds like a good movie... ...BUT, this DVD is jumpy, and has a pink circle pop up in the left corner about every 15 seconds. It doenst supprise me though, Goodtimes home video (who released this DVD) has never released a high quility movie. They are recorded in LP mode and have a high pitched squeal in them.I give this movie 4/5 stars, but the DVD is a 3/5 If you want this movie I sugest you buy the VHS it is also Goodtimes video, but it doesnt bother you as much."
2,"Great flying scenes, awful movie","The flying scenes in this movie are wonderful. The F-86 was an awsome plane and this movie has plenty of F-86 action. But it barely makes up for the pathetic story line. It's unbelievable and gets down right stupid, definitely NOT one of John Wayne's better movies. I would recommend this movie only to those who really like watching '50's era planes, make sure you have your remote handy."
2,"John Wayne, say it isn't so!","John Wayne has made some turkeys in his long and illustrious career, but this one tops them all. As for the air footage, it's great stuff. Especially for those who love the history of the American jet fighters.But, if you love good acting and demand the movie has a plot, you can skip this one.Janet Leigh does an excellent job of displaying her curvaceous wares, a la Howard Hughes. (His signature is all over this one)!"
5,Newsies!!!,Awesome cd!!! I love Jeremy Jordan's voice and the songs are good!! I wish I could see it on broadway
5,Fun Music!,"First of all, isnt it cool that we don't have to wait for a CD to arrive in the mail anymore. This is a great cd. You can't go wrong with this CD. The music is by Al Menken. He is an Oscar award winner and has written other scores for shows like The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin... just some good stuff."
4,"Old movie, 1 good song, not available on iTunes","I bought this for the song, It starts in the Heart. One song. The other songs are nice but not memorable. Unless you need it for a music class or love the movie, skip it."
1,You get what you pay for.,Made of thin shiney leather in China. The window in my case was skewed to the PDA display. It does offer good protection. My Rhodiana case fits better and is much better made by is lots more money.
2,Not happy so far,"Hi..I haven't had this heater very long but I am not happy with it so far. The dial has no calibration numbers on top and the heat in my tank fluctuates, i.e., it doesn't seem to have good thermostat action. The clamp on top is lousy too. I think I'm going to change to an Ebo Jager. Good luck."
1,didnt work for me,"this product did nothing for me and i have pcos so i was very dissatisfied, but my friend used it too and it worked for her. i guess its different for everyone"
5,Engrossing read! Buy it!,"Once I started reading this book I just could not put it down -- it was that good.If you're ""into"" serial killers, excellent writing, and a wonderfully woven story by all means pick up this book.I wish Ms. Hunter would write more books!"
4,STARTLING!!!!,"This book is NOT for the squemish!!! Although I read this when I was in fifth grade, this book is one of my all time favorites! Jessie Prichard Hunter, in his first novel, captivates the audiance with his unique storytelling ability, strange veiwpoint (The veiwpoint through most of the book is in the eyes of the KILLER of all people; Mr. Hunter genuinly shows his way of ""not following other cliches!), and his accomplished characters. A must read for all fans of new and in my words, ""better"" serial killer novels! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!"
1,Stay away!,"This book, written by a self-ordained ""expert"", reads like a dart-throwers guide to naivte. How he suckered notable financial columnists into favorable reviews bespeaks his apparent connections rather than reliable book advice. Each section of the book wreaks of pre-bubble advice best left to chat rooms and message board postings. For the sake of your children, do not buy this book."
2,Unacceptable...,"I had high hopes for this toon when it debuted on CN, but I was disappointed. However, this particular DVD was worthwhile for one reason...the ""HARD KNOCKS"" episode featuring The Incredible Hulk. This one episode is the only bright star in a series of badly written episodes. Hard Knocks is a 5 star eppy...I don't what happened to the rest. The Human Torch is very irritating, Reed Richards is an intellectual wishy washy nerd, Sue is ok, and Ben Grimm is a good character. The animation is well done, the writing stinks with Hard Knocks being the only exception.Buyer beware."
2,Here's hoping for re-tooling,"I was just watching the box-set of the last animated series, and it's important to note that it was the latter half. Why? Because the first half was unspeakably bad. Bad enough that it's almost worth watching with company, just so you can feel the room react when Doctor Doom smiles bashfully at a touch from Sue's hand.The second season of the old series was re-worked to fall in line with the FF books people were buying at the time -- characters were more layered, the costumes were updated, and it felt a lot less shoe-strung. I'm hoping that's why Cartoon Network pulled it for now -- the process has so much promise, but if they're looking to dazzle anything but the anime fans who have no contextual knowledge of the FF, they're gonna need to step up the plots."
2,"Oh, man. This was horrible.","I wanted to like this show so much but it totally was a let-down. The voices were all wrong for the characters and I really never warmed up to the anime style of the entire show. Plus, Johnny Storm had a weird Rod Stewart mullet that was just off-putting. I swear it was about as popular as a fart in church. Terrible terrible terrible. And yet, if I could get it used at a game store or something for under ten bucks, I might take a flier. The lesson is, as always, that I am a moron."
4,"FF-WGH, volume 1","The content on the DVD was great...It would have been nice to see a few special features and/or language/subtitles options included. Kudos to the marketing and creative team that developed this DVD. I was under the impression that more episodes would be included on the DVD (all episodes of season 1). Volume 1 is a rather vague term, and you don't realize what you're getting until you tear open the packaging and look inside. If there was more information regarding the contents of this DVD, I would have waited until every episode was available in one package. Clever, clever, marketing guys."
5,Powerful Living Photography,"I was lucky enough to see this wonderfully humane expose and photographic genius while it was on tour at The Philadelphia Art Museum years ago. At that time, I passed up buying this book at the Museum Store and regretted and searched in stores for it years later.If this book were on everyone's coffee table and looked at page by page ... there would be much more respect and much less oppression in the world. Good people would see to that."
5,Great Art with a purpose,"The bikes we ride, the tuna we eat, the oil that runs our cars, the gold we wear, are all manufactured, fished, drilled, mined, by countless people in remote corners of the world, often under extremely difficult and dangerous conditions, and more often than not, for extremely low wages. In this beautiful book, the Brazilian economist turned photographer Sebastiao Salgado put his Art to the Service of Humanity, to give us a window to the rest of the World that remains hidden from our TV screens and from our consciousness. The pictures are magnificent, and as true Art should, their impeccable technnique is there to serve the greater purpose of conveying meaning and emotion."
4,"Perfect photographs, but not quite.","Salgado is divine. He produces the most perfect images out there, in the documentary realm, and this book projects that well.The images are spectacular, no other word than that.Excellent printing of an amazing darkroom work.Still, one series stands out above all - the Brazilian gold mine workers.This is the only series where you can feel strong emotions and the judgmental eye of the photographer (and this is what I'm actually looking for in documentary photography. But it might be only me, though).I assume the reason for that is Salgado's origin, but nevertheless, I really wanted all the series in the book to be emotional as this one."
5,One of the best reporter's work ever.,"I discovered the book in a public library in Paris. I was really shocked when I just pass hundreds of pages just discovering great and greater pictures. In particular, I loved some chapters like the ""Mattanza"" thun-fish in Sicile, or the one settled in Bangladesh. The photographic style is pure and simple. The technique is simply perfect, so the work of Salgado is rated at a very high level, all over the book. The only ""but"" I find is that maybe there are so many good pictures you can swallow them at once!"
2,"Exquisite photographs, disappointing layout","I love these photographs, and the quality of the reproduction is exquisite -- BUTmost of the photos span two pagesHaving a ""spine crease"" in the middle of the photos detracts severly from their beauty and impact"
3,New or used?,I doubted between buying a new or a used book. I took a new one but regret it. Because the packaging is quite poor the corners of the book are slightly damaged and hence the boog is not anymore in mint condition. Used would be better.
3,Disappointed with Old Testament,I bought this for my elderly parents who cannot attend church. They were so happy with the New Testament - no problems. But as they are reading the Old Testament the CD will skip and leave out a portion of the text. I had read reviews on this particular item that this might be a problem but was hoping I would get one that didn't have this issue. Unfortunately I did. I feel I cannot take it away from my parents at this point and told them to just power through and listen to what they could.When you have several reviews that state the same problem the maker of this product should fix it - not just continue to knowingly sell them with this issue. I have been disappointed for my parents.
5,"Speedy, inexpensive","This order was fast, and the least expensive. I would buy another one in a heartbeat."
5,An Eternal Investment,"My purchase of ""The Listener's Bible"" was one of the best investments I have ever made. Max McLean does a tremendous job reading the text. He makes you feel as if you are listening to the author of each book. While reading he gives you each chapter reference so that you know where you are, but he does not give each verse (which would be quite annoying).After listening to ""The Listener's Bible"" for several weeks, I realized that I was getting a different perspective on the Bible. Normally I hear Scripture taught in church or I personally study smaller portions at a time. But by listening to longer sections of Scripture at a time, I've gained a deeper understanding of the Bible. For example, I am much more aware of how much of the Gospels were spent addressing the needs of the sick and the poor. I had always heard that this was so, but there was something about hearing it myself."
1,two chapters missing,"I downloaded this book, but the first two chapters are missing. I tried to post this review before, but it looks like I've been censored. Maybe Amazon has an attitude about giving away public domain books for free, when they also offer the same thing for money."
2,missing chpts,"I decided to get this ebook although another reviewer said it was missing the first two chapters. It is missing the first two chapters. However, it is pretty easy to find this book online. I plan on downloading those missing chapters to the kindle from another site so that I have the complete copy. Makes it a little more difficult. But still better than checking it out from the library."
3,Great Book When Read in Its Entirety,As others have said the free version of this ebook comes without the first two chapters. The full version is available free from the gutenberg project at [...]. I encourage you to read it!
5,Coins of the Ottoman Empire and the Turkish Republic: A detailed catalogue of the Jem Sultan collection,Excellent book-highly recommended to Turkish coin collectors.
4,Haunting performance,"While Rubenstein is my absolute top pick for these Chopin concertos, I love this version of Tamas Vasary. The sound is haunting and wistful, and the Berlin Philharmonic gets the best from the not-very-good orchestration that is the only flaw of Chopin's music; he was not an orchestral composer. Instead, Chopin featured the piano, for which he composed some of the most divine music ever for that instrument. The concertos are popular even despite their flaws. This is a wonderful recording, and one I've enjoyed for years."
2,Buy them at your local grocery,"I bought these chips when I ordered my smoker, only to find out that my local grocery had the same selection at a much better price. These were not bad chips, just not worth the extra cost and shipping over getting them locally."
2,To much $$$$,Home Depot sells exactly the same product for $3.99 a bag. I'm a bit disappointed to find them this expensive at Amazon.
1,Overpriced,You can purchase two to three time the amount of these wood chip at your local Wal-Mart store for the same $$$s or less.
4,Walter The Baker,Walter the Baker is good book.It's about a baker and his wife.They make the best food in the whole village.Everyone rushes in the morning to buy their goods.Even the prince.Till one day the cat accidently runs into the milk.So the prince gets very angry with his bread.So he has to come up with something before time runs out.Something the prince will be happy with.So he trys so hard to make something.It teaches your mistakes can turn out good. That change isn't always bad.This book is probaly for children between the ages of 6 and 8.
2,Not an entertaining story - a little irrational,"The beginning talks about a baker and what he does, which is good. Then Carle brings in an unjust Duke that tries to banish him for no good reason and thinks up of a silly task for Walter to save his home. Then it goes into talking about pretzles. It was a dumb story. I don't recommend it. I would have given it one star if it weren't for the illustrations."
1,From Founder All-Movie.com,"Sorry to say, but this may be the single worst perfomance by a leading actor in a film that I have ever seen, and I have seen thousands of films. Julia Ormand is fine, but Bill Paxton is beyond just bad. This is a movie about the Belgium resistance against the Nazis, complete with the execution of half a village, and here comes Paxton like he is in a Mary Poppins movie. It boggles the mind. Perhaps it is just me. I can't wait to hear what other viewers thought of this film."
2,So much promise......so little delivered!,"The basic premise of this movie had a lot of potential, but this one fell flat with me. I think this movie suffered from poor directing, which doomed it to mediocrity right out of the gate. But it was Bill Paxton's performance that made this movie nearly unbearable for me. His performance lacked weight and depth in every way. He was utterly unconvincing as a military officer, a man in love, and someone in touch with the gravity of war and all its ugliness. I was actually embarrassed for him. Julia Ormond, conversely, did a respectable job, but she along with a good concept couldn't mitigate the damage done by Paxton and the poor overall execution of the story."
3,resistance dvd,A cheap product. Good acting without the necessary vision required to carry a story line to a proper state of completion.
5,"Much, much, much better than 90% of the stuff I've read last year.","Just wanted to chime in with all the praise. I am in complete agreement. After reading this, I just couldn't help but feel like I've been cheating of a great comic book reading experience by all the other comics that I've read this year. If all writers wrote like Robert Kirkman, I'd be reading as many comic books titles as I did when I was a kid. Invincible brings that magic back."
4,Great for casual comic fans,"This breezy, fun and sometimes hillarious book is a great read for those uninitiated in the comic book world. Invincible is stripped of decades of continuity and complicated relationships that mainstream superhero comics from the 'Big 2' occasionally get bogged down with. The dark twist at the end of this volume cements the whole series as an inventive one with long term potential. However, as someone who is steeped in the current comic events from one of the major publishers, Invincible left me wanting more of the intricate intrigue that comes from following a series. Invincible also ends up feeling too derivative sometimes, as it ends up imitating the heroes it tries to homage. Having said that, i plan on following this series for the long run."
5,Addicting,"This book is absolutely addicting. It was incredibly hard to put down once I started and is utterly entertaining until the very end. Something that I appreciated about the ending was that it wasn't a cliff hanger but still left you with wanting something more. Not only is the writing great thanks to Robert Kirkman but it has easy on the eye art. It isn't too flashy but isn't too simple either, it just fits and works. Getting this book definitely got me hooked on the series and made me appriciate Kirkman even more for being able to tell an intriguingly entertaining story. Although there isn't much cursing in this series, I would recommened to parents to read this first before letting their kids under 13 read this title for the violence in the second half of the book. But other than that this book is great for anyone of any age or sex."
2,Didn't work for me.,It's a very grease and thick white cream. I bought this after all the great reviews. I used for my severe dry skin and my dry cracked feet and unfortunately for me it did nothing. I hate to be only negative review about but I didn't feel any better and went back to use Flexitol Heel Balm that to me is a little less grease and keep my feet smooth for a few days.
5,Cutemol Emollient Cream,"A friend recommended this cream for the face, she said her dermatologist told her to use it on her face. It makes the skin smoother looking and eliminates fine lines. It is thicker like a paste, but I skim it on all over my face neck and even on my decolletage which has made the skin more supple and younger looking."
3,Use only at bedtime...,Good but heavy. Use only as a moisturizer for my nails & cuticles because it takes to long to be absorbed. Maybe if you apply before bed...
4,Surprisingly non-sweet,"This one is interesting. The smell is very distinct, and I must admit I'm not very fond of the aroma.Now the flavor is entirely different. I was immediately struck by its lack of sweetness (compared to other honeys). It tasted more like a sweet cooking sauce. The taste actually reminds me of ""five spice powder"" used in Chinese cooking, sweetened with a bit of molasses. This is definitely one for cooking, particularly meats. I think that with some savory and pungent spices, a little soy, and perhaps a splash of rice wine, this would make an amazing honey chicken glaze."
2,ummm...huh?,"O.K. so I have one question. What's the deal with the gorilla? There is no acting in this movie guys, I mean come on....it's a joke!"
3,Erotic Witch Project,The scene where the womaan is leaned up by a tree and exploring herself was the best. She is really hot! Not much else seemed real or enjoyed by the ladies.I have seen two versions of this movie and am convinced there is still another one out there.The sequel to thiss version was hilariious.
5,VERY EROTIC!,"Finally a soft core film fans can truely enjoy! Too many hard core and soft core films rely on canned music and quick disolves. Like the Blair Witch Project, The Erotic Witch is photographed and works on the same voyeuristic levels. The Erotic Witch is one of those special movies that the sex scenes themselves dictate the pacing, climax and stucture of the scenes. The tent scene is one of the best lesbian scenes I have seen in years. Darian Caine and Katie Kean are Goddesses! Very well acted and brilliantly directed by John Bacchus who has a great sense of the sensitivity and warmth of lesbian sex. Buy this movie immediately! You will not be dissappointed!"
3,Bad Plot...Bad Acting...Bad Tans,"It's actually a fairly fun movie. I remember seeing the original VHS version when it came out in 1999, and the main difference I noticed with this ""collector's"" edition is that Darian Caine's hot masturbation scene was completely removed! That aside, there are some nice softcore lesbian scenes, the exceptionally fine Katie Keane, and the always-enthusiastic Darian Caine.The other ""minus"" as far as the DVD goes is the crispness of the image-- it really shows how crappy the lighting & makeup were on this set. All the girls have very spotty, blotchy tans that would look perfectly fine in a dimly lit strip club, but under harsh lighting and unforgiving videotape, make the girls look like strips of beef jerky."
1,Erotic?? I think NOT,"The women are barely average, the filming is very poor (even for a spoof on a poorly filmed movie), and there's a guy in a gorilla suit running around all through the film. BORING BEYOND BELIEF. This doesn't even qualify as porn - soft is too hard a word for it. If you watch closely, you get to see the girls lick the backs of their hands - wake me up when it's over!"
3,2 out of 3 ain't bad,"Seduction Cinema releases some really funny, cheap softcore lesbian parodies (if you can get your mind around that). They have good directors and writers. They do have a problem however with casting. Three of their actors are fantastic (Darrien, Katie Jordan, Misty) and fantastic looking. Luckily, these three star in many of Seduction's productions. But the rest of the woman they should just replace. Katie and Darrien star in Erotic Witch and they are great! The other woman (forget her name) isn't too great. Seduction should put more effort in casting beautiful, natural (i.e., unenhanced women) with little modesty. Goodness knows there seem to be a lot of them."
2,Underwhelming,"Okay... no one expects more than a threadbare plot to get the women out in the woods and get them naked. Even the contrivance of the escaped zoo gorilla providing a cameraman for when all three women are involved together is something that no one's going to carp about on a movie like this.My question is... where's the heat? Where's the fire? They never really seem into it. I never thought naked women getting it on with each other could be this boring.What a waste of time! And please, the blonde was cute, but the implant scars were so bad. Just another example of poor production values."
1,"Whatever you do, don't...","Big waste of time and money. If you want great soft-core, buy/rent 'Hidden Beauties' or 'Virtual Encounters.'"
4,greenwood!,"Here is greenwood is about a boy who moves into an all boys dorm (called Greenwood) because his older brother married the woman he is in love with. Once he has moved in he discovers that the inhabitants of the dorm are... odd.Here is Greenwood was good, but slightly confusing at parts. I really enjoyed it! If you like manga you'll probably like this."
1,Avoid this book if you are considering this sport...,"This is exactly the type of book one wants to avoid if considering a new sport. It starts with a life threatening crash, goes onto a hard landing that bends struts, and then the propeller flies off.....flying microlights can't be anything like this or they would all be dead...Irresponsible to say the least..."
1,"15inch blade, not a 24inch!","Watch out, as this product discription is misleading! Blade is realy 15 inches, not 24 inches as one might infure from the part number (24-380) and other blade part numbers."
2,You get what you pay for!,"The two chargers that come with the package are ok. They are very similar to the originals received with the phone. The batteries, however are pretty much worthless. They only keep a charge for a day, maybe, with only moderate use. The old batteries they replaced were about that good. When I contacted the seller they were very helpful and sent us replacements right away, but they turned out to be the same. Next time I will definately pay the extra for a good battery."
3,A disappointment,"Cakewalk Pyro 2005I have had Pyro 1.5 for years and just loved it! When I installed this new Pyro 5, it stripped my registration code for Pyro 1.5 and disabled the mp3 conversion feature. I really liked the old version better after trying the new one. I found a few glitches in Pyro 5, and now I can't use Pyro 1.5 anymore. Their tech support was not able to help me with getting the old one back, however he did make the effort."
3,"Great fit for player, bad fit for accessories","I was very excited to see that my Sansa had a silicone case. The clear plastic sheeting one that comes standard with the Sansa left a bit to be desired.My new silicone case fits well with the provided armband that came with my player and the case fits nice and snug to the player.Two concerns:1. There is no ""face guard"" for the Sansa. The case simply wraps around the outside (which is probably enough to guard it in most cases).2. I was VERY DISAPPOINTED when trying to put my Sansa wrapped in its silicone case into my SanDisk Car-FM-Adapter. It doesn't fit. You have to take the player out of the case to get it to fit in the car adapter. Very displeasing, but in the scheme of things - I can deal with it."
2,Dry Earthbound Recording.,"I have been collecting SACD records for some time now and found many of Spano's recordings to be excellent. In particular, his Vaughan-Williams Sea Symphony in Atlanta had the majesty, warmth and affection of a recordings by English masters such as Barbirolli and Boult. This particular performance sounds earthbound, unspired. The recording even in SACD surround is tight and dry. Most unpleasant to listen to in the big moments. The many classic recordings by Colin Davis, Charles Munch and Charles Dutoit are significantly better, and the Davis is available in surround sound from pentatone in SACD format. It still sounds great even though recorded in the late 60s."
2,It was just ok!,I found this documentary kind of difficult to follow and the camera work and audio were a bit choppy. It seemed like it was made with someone's camcorder or cell phone video camera. It's an interesting subject matter but not worth watching based on the production values.
1,Awful,"Terrible. I thought it would be a documentary about crime and police. Not much of a plot, just a meandering doc, everyone is blurred out. Bad."
3,Worked well... until...,"Pros- It does what it is made to do, and does it wellCons- Prone to breakage, not as durable as you would want it."
2,Easily outdated,"Not windows 7 compatible, and to be honest, not really needed anymore. If you still need this... I don't have words... I'm sorry."
1,Don't get it,It doesn't even work for vista! I tried many ways to get it to work and nothing helped. It don't work for window 7 or higher.
5,One trick then worked great!,After installing I realized that the connector showed as a network place. I am otherwise firewalled. Once I turned Windows firewall off on that connection everything worked great. My Wii is over 50 feet away and it works just fine. Just go on Nintendo.com to get the latest software.
3,Frustrated,"I couldn't get this to work on my own, but it does finally work.Neutral review.I would recommend just skipping the product altogether if you have a wireless router/modem, because it's much easier to set up internet on your DS that way. However, fi you don't use wireless, this works good enough."
2,"Faulty product, buyer beware.","I bought this for use with my Nintendo DS. It worked fine at first, then would only work for a short period after plugging in. After several months, it stopped working entirely. I have read that these never worked well and were taken off the market because of various problems. I wish I hadn't wasted my money on this. I ended up buying a wireless router after this burned out - works consistently and much more versatile."
5,Nintendo DS Wi-Fi USB Connector,"This worked great. I had a small problem during installtion, which was my fault for being hastey. Follow the directions to the letter and everything is A O K. After the installation connecting is easy as pie for the DSI and WII. It was for my 9 year old daughter. It was for her and she's able to connect with no problems. I wonder why Nintendo discontinued this product."
1,Horrible!!,I brought this item over a year ago and we still can't get it to work. Nintendo has been of little help. I have disabled the firewall and removed all antivirus software but it still doesn't work. It was a waste of my $30. I'd save your money until nintendo improves on the model that they have.
1,Not easy...,"After a lot of hours, we finally got it working correctly, but at the end we ended buying a wireless router."
1,Headaches,"I got the USB wireless connector and it installed and works just fine. I did have to install it without my windows firewall to get it to install. But it worked just fine with my DS games. But the wireless connector gave me the biggest headache, and made me dizzy--so much that I'm not using it again. What a waste of money."
1,Great product but...,it gets one star because it is a Windows only device - what about the millions of Mac users out there nintendo?
3,Worked fine but wasn't needed.,This product worked fine but it turned out I didn't actually need it to get internet on my Wii. I already had a wireless router in the house which worked fine.
1,I'm sure it would have been great if it worked.,"I bought Nintendo Wi-fi USB adapter in hopes of getting my Wii online. After installing the drivers that came with the adapter, the Wii was able to at least communicate with my computer, but when it tried to do anything useful, like actually connect to the internet, I got errors. After doing some research on the Nintendo website, I saw that there were several updated drivers. But each time I tried to install the latest drivers, I'd get an error. After hours of trying to uninstall the old driver and install the new driver, I finally just broke down and got a wireless router. My Wii was connected to the internet in a matter of minutes."
1,Don't waste your time on this!,"I bought one, followed the instructions to the letter. Wouldn't finish the install. I tried it on all 4 jacks on the back of the computer and both on the front, still wouldn't install. I even went to Nintendo's website to download the latest version of the program and still wouldn't install. Went to the customer support section and saw where Nintendo has discontinued this item, so obviously, I'm not the only one who's had problems."
1,Not worth the money,"I tried using two different USB connectors and they never worked properly for me. The two most typical problems (for me anyway) were:Connection problems: No matter how long I spent trying to connect, the DS would just not go online with this USB connector. I looked up error codes online and they still would not fix the problem.Length of play: On the VERY rare chance I actually went online with this thing, I would be on for about five minutes AT MOST. I spent the time connecting to a game and then got dropped at the last second.I would just buy a decent router if I were you."
1,"Was nice once upon a time, but now?","This product was good for awhile when I first received it years ago. However, it stopped working long ago.Many who have owned these have had them go bad, or not work. Nintendo has discontinued support for this device, so you are better off just getting a wireless router and configuring your Wii or your DS to use that instead.I'd consider this product dead and obsolete. Do not buy!"
1,Buyer Beware!!,I have to agree with some of these people. I bought the Wi-Fi to use with my Wii system. I tried downloading the software 3 times and still kept getting error commands. Plugged it into 3 different USB ports. No dice. Im going to have to trade this in. I no longer have the packaging to turn it in. Was a waste.
1,YOU ARE BEING RIPPED OFF,You can buy this off the nintendo store n website for about $19.99 so why would anyone buy it for new $149.99 or even worse used from $89.99 really try real numbers buddy even toys r us has it for cheeper even game stop has it for online order its only $14.99
2,DONT GET IT,"WORK UNTILL THEY DID A UPDATE TO MY WII , JUST HOOK A ETHERNET CABLE AND GET THAT ETHERNET ADAPTER FOR IT THAT WORK FASTER"
1,Nintendo Wi-Fi USB Connector,"Don't waste your money on this.It did not work for me, and after reviewing blogs on this item, it probably won't work for you."
4,Works great! Watch out for heat...,"Totally easy to set up. Plugged it into the pc, followed the instructions and within 10 minutes I was up and running. My connector is about 8ft from the wii so i have full signal also.I guess the only ""bad"" thing would be that after 2 hours or so... the connector was warm-hot. It could just be my own pc though, not too sure. When not using the wii I unplug the connector so that should suffice for now."
4,Good buy,"Just follow the instructions. You really need to install the software to make it work correctly. It is not plug and play like other devices. Other than that, it works great with the Wii and the DS. It works well if you don't have a router. Note: Product does get really hot when plugged. I recommend unpluging when not in use."
3,Inconsistent,Good luck trying to install this thing on anything newer than XP. I can't even find the drivers on the internet anymore.
3,If you have Wi-Fi you don't need it...,"You only need this thing if you do not have wi-fi in your house. This device plugs into a PC with a wired internet connection and then the Wii talks, via wireless signal, to this thing, and in turn uses that PC's internet connection. Naturally, the PC needs to be on for it to work."
3,Good buy for a better price.,I looked all over for this item the same day I bought and set-up my Wii. I found that it is the cheapest at Target stores. In order for this thing to work it must be clear from any objects and you must drop your firewall. I drop my firewall and keep my browser closed while I use the online features. I wish Nintendo would provide a download to fix this problem. The DS never seems to identify a Wi-Fi connection even if you set it next to the thing. Other then that it worls pretty good at getting the Wii online. If you have the keyboard attachement from the ActionReplay board you can use it to surf the web faster through Wii. Overall it is a pretty good product and easier then all the cables required for the Lan thing. Shop around and look for the lowest price because I got it for less then $20 at Target unlike the $30 here.
1,bad,"i had one of these and it was really bad. i couldn't even get wi-fi at all, it kept on giving an error, unable to connect to server. i did a little internet browsing and they are using old tech for this, last time i check, which was a while back, it was six years old, so they were using tech from 6 years ago. plus i wasn't the only one with the unable to connect issue either. your better off buying something else and not this. it was a waste of money"
4,So far so good,"I bought this USB connector for 4 months. It is still working. I plug it in my laptop with Windows XP 32 bit. I encounter a difficulty when I try it on my desktop (Windows Vista 64 bits). I won't bother figuring out how to solve it because it works great with my laptop. I heard that Windows 7 can run all application that Windows XP can run but I haven't tested it yet.It's fairly hot after plugged in for about 2 - 3 minutes. I'm not sure if that's normal but as long as it works for me, I won't complain about it much.If you have to share wireless with your roommate and cannot change the password encryption to WEP, I recommend buying one. By the way, I obtained many event pokemon through this USB connector. ^.^"
3,Mac + Nintendo?,"I'm disappointed that Nintendo hasn't come out with a version of the software that works on a Mac.I have Parallels installed on my MacBook Pro with a Windows XP virtual machine, and even though the software recognizes the device in this virtual installation of Windows I can't get my DS to connect unless I use an actual Windows XP machine (and not a Mac pretending to run Windows :P ) It's a good thing I still run Windows XP on one of my laptops.Note to Nintendo - Mac is gaining some market share. It might be time to come up with some compatible software!"
3,Nintendo Wi-Fi USB Compatibility Problem,"Though this product worked well on my 32-bit Windows XP computer, it is incompatible with my 64-bit Windows 7 Upgrades. Though any 32-bit user can get online using the website's 1.07 drivers and installing in compatibility mode in order to run it in Windows 7 (as several Vista or XP versions), the device stops there.While running in compatibility mode, normal use of the computer is slow. If you are playing Wii or DS, the actual use of the computer while connecting for online upgrades or games is only an issue with a shared house of people.Overall, this product does give a lot of features for the original price of $50 in 2008, but beware when purchasing what type of computer you plan on running it from before choosing between this and the Wii wireless LAN which offers similar features with decreased safety."
1,Pointless coaster brochure,"Being extremely interested in roller coasters and theme park attractions in general, yet also being terribly prone to motion sickness (yes, I know this sounds weird, and it is), I really looked forward to this book. Which, unfortunately, isn't a book at all, but a sort of slim and undersized prozine. And this is the first problem. Then we have extremely factless texts, which could only interest those who never had access to very basic information about roller coasters (like, yes they do have brakes, guys). And finally most photographs are straight out park brochures, thus very spectacular and very poorly reproduced.Interesting only for cartoon chickens fans, as some of the cartoons introducing each chapter are actually damn funny."
1,terrible,senseless anecdotes and silly stories of stupid people getting scared on the whimpiest roller coasters. if u want good rollercoaster reviews check out The Deadliest Thrill Rides Ever by Maxwell Nortini
3,adequate,"I bought this for my 9 year old daughter for Christmas. When I received it the bottom of the keyboard was cracked and the music sheet holder was broken in 4 pieces. Other than the shipping damage issues it has served it's purpose. My daughter specifically wanted a pink keyboard and that is what she got. It's not as heavy as I expected but the different sounds and rhythms are perfect for a beginner. The volume control could go a little lower to suit me, but she loves it. I wish it had a headphone jack."
1,cheap,"this keyboard looks , cheap ,chinese made,they spelled country as ""councry"" very dissappointed.not worth what it costs,should be 15.00"
1,junk!,"Poorly crafted, fittings are misaligned, parts don't fit together. Looks cheap, edges splinter. Waste of money and a headache to get refund."
4,Mice Cube gentle mouse trap,"The first couple of weeks we caught several mice, so we were happy with the traps. A few weeks later, we still have lots of mice, but not catching many now - perhaps they've wised up, or I need some variety in the bait! The traps are smaller than I expected. The larger deer mice can barely fit in them, but we've still caught a few. With a mouse in the trap, you must be careful while carrying it to the release site. If it gets tipped the wrong way, the door easily falls open and the mouse could jump out before you're ready to release it. On the plus side, multiple mice can enter the trap and are stuck inside once the door closes - we once caught 2 small mice overnight in the same trap. The traps are relatively cheap, humane, easy to clean and reusable."
5,Kind mouse traps,You need to check them 2 times a day so the mouse will not die. Then you can release it outside well away from the house.
4,Silly Songs Sound Super,A great CD for kids that parents will also appreciate...and useful to amuse the children for those long trips in the car.
1,?????,Some of these songs i think are very old and not for today's market. Not catchy. Sorry disney its a bust from me.
5,Kids just so enjoy this.,I first came across this in 1993 and my nieces and nephews just loved singing along to it in the car. I played the tape till it broke! Now I have found it again in 20011 and it is still every bit as much fun and the kids just enjoy the daft songs on it. Incidentally my grown up nephew's and niece still remember the songs . A good investment to singalong to in the car on long journeys.
2,Old childhood favorite,I bought this for my son because I grew up listening to the cassette. The songs bring back great memories but it has static on the disc. Really disappointed that the sound quality is not better.
4,Great family fun,"Lots of silly songs, many are the kind kids used to sing at camp way back when. Good fun for the family. Great for playing in the car on trips."
2,Not entertaining at all,"I did not like this CD at all either my kid. It is so boring! It is not music for real. Some of the ""songs"" are like a chat with some music in the background. It is not like I expected. My husband got a Crayola crayons package that comes with two CDs. These are much much better. It is music, fun music... In fact my baby just asks me to play it for her every time she rides in the car with me. I enjoy it as much as her. I played the Disney CD once and put it in a drawer....Sorry, Disney, you were not assertive this time."
4,Carpenters thoughts,"Love this knife to bits... but thats the (only) problem. The screw that the blade pivots on gets loose often and unless you see it/tighten it, one side will fall out. I'm just about to order my third knife cause of this. Still would not use any other type of knife and no other brand. (Hu$ky sucks!)"
4,Handy and Tough,"I had to buy another one of these after I finally lost the first one after years of using it. This knife works remarkably well for all the moving parts. I have used it to cut sheetrock, trim moulding, and just about anything I would need a box cutter for. The folding mechanism and the blade storage work remarkably well and you don't need to find a screwdriver. The only problem I had was when my old one fell in a puddle of solvent, this melted the blade storage making it hard to open. Even with that, I found it much more useful than the old style box cutter, even for cutting hundreds of feet of sheetrock. Well worth the money."
3,Bulky,"I like the blade,.solid construction, nice features like locking back and storage for extra blades. Not very ergonomic, a bit too wide to carry in the pocket like a pocket knife, this is more for keeping in the desk or on the workbench. There, it is safer than a standard knife because the blade folds in."
4,I Liked It,"Good time traveling story, lots of nudity and hot women. Goes in my ""see again"" collection."
5,Spectacular,"I have read both books and I just love reading about Monique and this time her Aunt and Grandfather while mother is on her honeymoon. I hate to put the book down, she hold's my interest all the time I'm looking forward to her next book being published and I hope to hear more about Monique in the near future. Diane Amos is a very good writer as I am paticular as to how the writer tries to keep you on the edge of your seat."
3,"great for beginner, needs some work on the examples","I'll start of with the positive, this book definately give lots of explanations of the concepts used, and lots of background for those not familiar with GNU/Linux or C++. I did find the example code supplied extremely buggy, and required lots of modifications to compile. Also, in the sections of system calls (threads and pipes), the example code only shows wrappers around the actual calls needed, and they only show the definition of that wrapper class, not the implementation. I guess if I want to find out exactly how to create a thread or named pipe, i'll have to dig elsewhere."
2,Poor.. Very poor,"This book is full of mistakes. It also begins by teaching you to program one way, and then tells you that this is wrong. I picked up this book as a refresher, because I have not done any C++ or UNIX in 10 years, but even I could pick out the mistakes in the book. It does not explain the important aspects of C++ very well, skipping over most things with just a cursory description of what is going on. Do not get this book.."
3,Book is great but CD has a problem,The book is well written in clear language and the example scripts are written in a special font making it easy to understand. I just cannot get the CD containing the compiler to work and it's vital to the lessons.The CD loads the files but the install log shows an error on one item. Problem is some 'merge' file that's missing in the windows folder of the CD download. Does anyone else have a problem?The CD is the important part of the purchase.
3,exciting action Western,"Flynn stars as an escaped prisioner during the Civil War who goes to Virginia City, Nevada to try and intercept a shipment of gold bullion earmarked for the Confederacy. His two frequent co-stars (and off screen drinking buddies), Guinn ""Big Boy"" Williams and Alan Hale accompany him. On the stagecoach West, Flynn meets and falls in love with a shy and secretive young woman (the woefully miscased Miriam Hopkins) He will meet her again in Virginia City under entirely different circumstances. The villian is the capable Randolph Scott who is a Confederate spy bent on getting the gold out of town. A hilariously miscased Humphrey Bogart appears as a Mexican bandito complete with black hair and a sleazy moustache and an accent worthy of the Taco Bell dog! Not to be missed for this alone! The climax is a harrowing Indian attack on the wagon train and an interesting off-beat ending."
4,Western / Civil War,Bogart as a Mexican...Hard to believe and harder for him to pull off...Watch it anyway.
2,Pure Tin,"Errol Flynn's first Western, ""Dodge City,"" was all pretty Technicolor photography and no script... so for this, his second, Warners made it up to him. This one is all shadowy black and white photography and more plot than you can possibly make sense of. It also features two classic bad performances -- uptight Miriam Hopkins as a showgirl Mata Hari, and sneering Humphrey Bogart as a muy menacing Mexican bahndeeto. To paraphrase Hemingway, any movie where Randolph Scott is the best actor is a bad movie."
4,An Inspiring Read for Anyone,The translation of Rilke's Letter's to a Young Poet is a great read for anyone. It lifts your spirit in your search for that greatness in whatever you do. This is an especially moving book to give to those artists in our lives. Rilke's advice to the young poet about life and work is translated eloquently and breaks into our lives. I recommend this book to anyone who searches for hope and inspiration in whatever you do.
5,Insightful and thoughtful,"This translation of Rainer Maria Rilke's advice to a young would-be poet, Franz Kappus, helps to affirm his standing as one of humanity's most insightful artists in any medium, in any language.Rilke appears to offer advice not so much to help Kappus understand our world, as how best to respond to it (by ""world"" I mean our mental world as well as our social world). Rilke thoughtfully discusses how an artist's life involves great discipline and patient effort in order to reinforce what is positive and leave behind what is negative. This advice is universal and can apply to any religion, discipline, or intent.It's hard to think how one could not find a useful and valid insight on each page of this gentle work. Everyone will have some line or two which stands out as their favorite. If you are at all interested in Rilke, or in responding to Life, this book should be wonderful for you."
5,Images so beautiful it hurts.,A simply beautiful book. I highly recommend it to those who love the written word.
5,timeless wisdom,"Ten letters Rilke wrote to an aspiring poet askingfor his help with becoming a poet.Surprisingly for the reader and probably as well forthe recipient of said letters, Rilke doesn't go intothe poetry aspect at all, but clearly refuses to doso right in the first letter.Instead he treats the questions of what it means towork on becoming a fully developped human being.Giving timeless advice full of wisdom about solitude,troubles, sorrows, love, human interaction and beingpart of a society in which one doesn't seem to really fitin.Wonderful advice, very often in the form of further questionsthat Rilke seemed to have sent back in order to encouragethe recipient to go further in his quest of finding whateverything means (to him) and who one is.Wonderfully poetic advise to be shared and read and reread"
5,The Artist's Bible,"I received this book as a gift from a very dear friend when I began seriously studying to be a conductor. Reading the words about solitude and strength and commitment to one's art has helped me through many rough times when I felt like giving up, and I keep the book close to my heart. I can't recommend this book too highly. If you aspire to be an artist of any kind - or just aspire to great things in life - you should read this book."
1,Poor translation of an even poorer book,"I've never understood the fascination with the ""wisdom"" of the 28 year old Rilke. To me, this is quite possibly the most condescending work in German literature."
4,Soft otter and handy purse in one!,"The otter is very soft! The starfish for mine was a little off and not perfect and the purse is shiny, but fades after a while. The otter also came with a tiny tear that's not notifiable with the human eye or even big enough for a need to sew. Great item though! I love it and recommend it!"
3,100 FAST & EASY BOAT IMPROVEMENTS,"The book has some very good information and some that is just ok.I like seeing how others do something I want to do before I try it.The book does cover some of thing I was looking for, but other parts left me with a Ah - so what?Am I happy with having bought the book? YES,OK maybe 4*."
5,"Another fine Casey ""How-To...""",Don Casey has firmly established himself as an effective communicator of all things nautical...particularly in the do-it-yourself category. This is an enjoyable little volume which contains a number of projects designed to improve the safety and liveability of the sailboat. The excellent and clear illustrations make the written descriptions easy to follow. The International Marine Sailboat Library has a number of these useful how-to books (several by Casey) which belong on nearly any sailor's bookshelf.
3,Lots of ideas that you probably don't need,"I found this book nice and easy to read - but I have found that I have not really introduced any of these improvements in my boat. So I guess the main purpose of a book like this, is that you start thinking for yourself and maybe be inspired to think of even better improvements that suits your boat and your needs."
2,100 Fast & Easy Boat Improvements,This book is mostly geared toward sailboats and large cruisers. Of very little value to power boaters. At best I'd give it a fair.
4,Performance and safety.,"I have the 9"" Fin for my longboards.I've used this fin for my 9'6"" single fin longboards.Does it work? Yes. There is no performance difference using this fin. It is a very standard template but holds well on noserides. I've used it in hollow beachbreak and it doesn't slide out or flex too much.The fin is plastic with a soft edge and can still hurt if you land right on it but it shouldn't cut you.I wish they made this fin in a 9.5"" version too."
2,bad movie in the dvd,very bad movie and in the med.of movie it change want blk and back to movie for 2-3 mn.you can not see the movie
3,Not the collection,"Be aware that this item as a rental contains only the first film, not the entire collection. The cover text is deceptive in that regard. You'll have to go elsewhere to see the sequel. Otherwise, well worthwhile."
3,Ahh....memories!,"Growing up in the 1970s, I used to watch these films on Creature Double Feature on Channel 56 in Boston. I recall not liking them so much because the monster didn't stomp until almost the end of the film. However, when I recently watched the first movie (Giant Majin), I actually thought the plot was good! I thought I was going to end up fast fowarding to the end, but I was into the movie. A very pleasant surprise and a nice trip down memory lane. I gave this 3 instead of 4 stars because I thought the second movie lacked in plot, but the special effects were good."
5,Excellent!,"This is a really good & sturdy product for the price.The company sent it out late, so I thought they forgot my order.I sent a note, then I received it soon afterward."
4,good quality cane,"We thought that it would be lighter for a halloween costume, but no... it is an actual walking stick so it has some weight to it."
1,Lousy book,"This book rates no stars, really - it is really a lousy book. As the reviewer above stated - 12 kings and queens of Egypt are picked out of the air, with no rhyme or reason as to why they were chosen above others. And then this is combined with the 'classical deitites' of Greece and Rome which makes no sense whatever. Are Egyptians supposed to have worshiped these gods? No. Then why include them? A ridiculous book."
2,No reason for Abbott labs to charge so much for Nepro,"Nepro is basically a whey protein shake with added complex carbohydrates, corn syrup and oil. These are all readily available and inexpensive ingredients that you can mix yourself. Just be sure to exclude anything that is high in sodium, potassium, phosphorus and calcium, starting out with a high quality whey protein shake you can get at any health food or even costco or sam's club. You can also add a higher quality oil than the canola oil Nepro contains, such as flax seed or grape seed oil. In the end you will get a fresher and healthier drink for the renal patient at a much lower cost (6 to 10x lower).Another important reason for mixing your own drink is that for the diabetic, you can also adjust the sugar and complex carbs to suit a renal-diabetic patient."
4,Best price on the internet.,Amazon discounts make this an unbeatable deal.I saved more than 20 percent on a case.
3,Works but the fingers are a little thick,"This is one of those few things I should have spent extra on and bought locally. Its well made, holds its shape and is fun to play with. Unfortunately the fingers are a bit thick, making it hard to get much detail in your profile. If I would have bought it at a store I would have realized this fact and probably chosen a different model."
2,Strong case but pin breaks,"The Rhino Ttanium case has saved my M515 several times, BUT...The case has two design flaws:1. The case is a little sloppy around the M515, just a little annoying.2. The pin that holds the Palm goes inot the silo and eventually gets sloppy. You need to bend the pin to improve fit, but after the second slight ""adjustment"" IT BROKE OFF!! Now the case is useless since there is nothing to keep the Palm in the case."
1,Not a good buy,Pretty useless book. I shouldn't have bought it but I don't have the time to package and send it back. It's pretty out of date and little on substance
4,Star Book for ministers from a Pagan Minister,"Personally I purchased this book because of its High Praise, even though it is for Christian ministers. I myself am a Pagan Minister, and still found it very interesting and full of information, though I skipped the Selected Scriptures section.My advice to you, If you are a newly ordained Minister, of ANY Religion, buy this book. Worth IT."
5,Much better edition.,"This version is much better than the first 1878 edition which was an optical character recognition (OCR)scan, as it was originally published. The publisher claimed not to be responsible for the book being old, worn and the type faded in the translation of this version.The first version was to be available at a low price as opposed to not being available at all. The original version has many typos and missing text. The publisher provides a trial website to order a copy of the revised editionsa at a cost."
5,A great ministers guide,"I received the used Star Book for Ministers in a timely matter and in great condition.The Star Book for Ministers is a great aid/recommendation for ministers, deacons, and those who work the 5 fold ministry."
3,Okay,It is an okay book. I thought it would have been more helpful since my uncle had recommended i get it.
5,A+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++,I got this book for my Kindle & at Family Christian Storea great book about being a pastorits small pocket sizegreat book
3,I'm the first guy to review this?,"Not a bad book. I've just enjoyed getting to know more about WWI, being more versed in WWII. Some of the best parts of the book are the unbelievable courage it must have taken to pilot a 1916-model airplane in the black of night and try to be on target with your payload. It's not a gripping tale, by any means, but what I liked about it is that the author was a dear friend of the gentleman who flew these missions, and he compiled his notes partly in talking to him and by reading the documented reports fed to the Royal Air Force. The book was published, I believe, after the flyer had died. Good for a quick read."
2,Trouble running on Windows XP,"I honestly liked this product; decent games, very nice graphics, and most importantly my 2 year old loved it.However, I could not get the sound to function properly; when it works at all it is choppy, cuts off words, and sometimes even sounds like a broken record. I thought of keeping the software but it the sound is just too annoying and you need it to play the games.I believe the problem is that I'm running Windows XP, and since this Disney software is a few years old it does not run properly on XP. There's actually a disclaimer in the instructions saying they cannot guarantee compatibility on Windows 2000 (XP is based on Win 2000.) The manual mentions to update all drivers on your computer, all mine are brand new for XP.For what it's worth, after exhausting the manual and the included product troubleshooting, I found a pretty good troubleshooting page on Disney's website at: http://asp.interactive.go.com/support/disney/index.asp"
4,Elvis fan,"I have been an Elvis fan since I was 13 and I always liked this new CD's with all the extra outtakes that make one feel as if taking part of the original recording sessions. Good to find out that the original edition for ""A Big Hunk of Love"" is included as when it first came out, for some reason when the remastered CD's started to show up, this recording was not the same. The art work takes me back in time and it is as if I had my old LP looking brand new. My only disappointment is that the sound is not outstanding. I recently got a new issue of the CD album ""Girls, Girls, Girls"" on the economic Sony label and I was amazed with the quality of sound, this is why I only give four star to the double CD reviewed here."
5,perfection,"living in Fl, we constantly get brownouts from lightning storms, etc. This product does what it says and does it well. I highly recommend others to try it."
2,VERY average phone + short battery life = 2 star phone,"When I bought this phone over a year ago, I bought it chiefly for the walkie-talkie feature, speakerphone feature and international usability (...). After one year of use, the walkie talkie feature is the only above average aspect of this phone. The speaker phone is tinny, and interupts incoming audio if there is the slightest noise entering your mic. The cross-platform usability is such a hassle I never bothered going through the steps necessary to use it overseas. The worst part of this phone (besides Nextel's TERRIBLE network-- don't plan on using if you are more than 5 miles from a major interstate or metro area) is the battery life, which with minimal useage is less than two days. This is a VERY average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network. I would steer clear of this phone, and hope that Nextel's recent merger with Sprint improves the network it operates on."
3,Upgrades - i730,"Just to let the complainers know. If you take the phone to the Nextel repair shop, there is a hardware and software upgrade to improve performance. I found out when I couldn't get the GPS to connect."
3,Just Not For Me,"I've had this phone for over a year and a half and I've really never had a problem with it. The reception varies but it's generally pretty reliable. My whole family uses it for work because of the walkie-talkie feature.I personally don't like the phone because I'm not a fan of the walkie-talkie feature (I think it's obnoxious most of the time) and it's simply a pretty big phone, like a lot of Nextel phones.It's a good phone and well-priced, but for me some things about it are really inconvenient."
3,i730 is not that bad,"The i730 is a great phone, but I still think sprint is better. I gave this phone a rating of 3 because it doesn't recieve service everywhere you go. that's CRAZY! I thought nextel recieved signal anywhere. Currently I attend Wayne State and my phone rarely has service. On the other hand if I'm at home my phone never drops calls. Nextel really needs to step it up a notch, buI guess I can't say much about it because sprint will be buying them out soon."
3,Good but not Great!,"This phone is good, but not great. I've had it for about two years. The second year the datebook started malfunctioning. No matter what date you would enter for future reminders, it would ring at 7AM the day before. For ex., If I wanted the alarm to ring at 2:30 pm on March 25 and set it under the custom 90 minutes, it would ring on March 24 at 7AM. I also didn't like the fact that this phone only holds datebook data for 3 weeks. What if you need to check back in 6 months for reference to appointments. They are erased! If you can stand those annoyances then the phone is good, not great."
2,"Nice features, bad design","The features on this phone are awesome, but the design of the phone is terrible. The direct connect speaker is located on the back of the phone, so when you're using it, the sound goes directly into the palm of your hand. This wouldn't be bad, but he direct connect microphone is located on the opposite side of the phone. It just isn't near as loud as my I90C. If you're buying it to look good and put a trophy on your belt, this is your phone. If you're buying it for functionality and to actually use it in a real world environment, consider another nextel."
3,Not what i Expected,My sister and father both had the i730 before me and i thought it would be cool to get one since we could direct connect each other back and forth. But the phone isn't that great. Heres's the details.What I Like:* Voice recorder- cool for diff. stuff* Speaker Option- Great for not wanting to always have the phone on your ear* DC or Direct ConnectWhat i don't like:* Whack Options for wallpaper* Whack RingtonesI can't even download a free ringtone like most phones. If you don't buy internet your screwed. The phone is boring.
2,Did not come with holster. Long distance from home......,"No holster as stated in the bottom of the ""phone data"" link(...)Components:Battery, Battery Door, Phone, Holster, Welcome Guide, User Documentation )To activate the phone, Nextel first transfered me about 6 to 8 times. They could not provide a phone number that was local in my city (pop. of 40,000). I knew of 2 cell phone number prefixes that were local in my area with Nextel, but they said that no more numbers were available in them. After dealing with nextel on the phone (many, many phone calls) and trying over 6 phone numbers prefixes that all ended up being long distance, I went to the local Nextel dealer and they set it up right away with a phone number prefix that the 800 number people said was unavailable.Overall a major pain (...)to activate over the phone. It is nice that the phone will be free after rebate minus the cost for another holster ~ $15."
2,"Screen Smaller than i95, No Alarm Clock, Horrible U-Face","I was hoping motorola would come out with a phone with an alarm clock with a simple snooze, not yet, still have to go through a 10 step process through the date book, common give me a break. The screen is now in a 65k color display, but they have shrunk the screen so you can hardly see anything. The buttons are extremly bulky and don't interface well with the tiny buttons on the screen you can hardly see. I'm getting rid of Nextel all together because they definetly have the most unfriendly, non-functionability phones on the market."
3,I'm upgrading to the i860,"The i730 is okay, but it's not what i thought it would be. I was disappointed. It can't download real tones off of the phone like most phones, it can only download polyphonic. That is whack! Polyphonic tones are last year, people want tones that sound like real songs. This phone is whack compared to the sprint phone. It has the walkie-talkie like the i730, but it has a camera on top of that! If you guys haven't seen the i860 yet, look it up. This phone gives the sprint phone competition. It has a camera, video recorder, everything. It makes the i730 look like a big chunk of metal."
1,STAY AWAY FROM NEXTEL,"Please take my advice and stay away from Nextel and the Motorola i730 phone. It drops calls constantly (error 841), and direct connect is always marginal on transmission. Nextel says ""it's motorola's fault"". I had to send a brand new phone to motorola with no loaner. Get it back and it's still won't transmit right. Now my bill is jacked up from all the dropped call re-calls and they won't credit it. STAY AWAY FROM NEXTEL AND TELL EVERYONE YOU KNOW ABOUT THIS MESSAGE. It's time consumers take a stand on the BS ""contracts"" of carriers. They are the number one contributer to bad credit hits."
5,Nextel Nationwide Walkie Talkie is the Best,"This is the coolest phone. You can use it like a walkie-talkie instantly across the United States. It has saved me so much time of calling, waiting for the phone to ring and making pleasant conversation. Gets to the point. Gets things done. I traded in my i90 for the i730. You can go to the Motorola site and download .wav file ring tones that sound like a real voice. This is a great business tool, but it's also fun to use. Get it."
2,GETTING RID OF THIS PHONE TODAY,"Finally the end of a frustrating 1 year contract with NEXTEL. This phone drops calls, doesn't get a signal, flashes error messages freaquently, often polutes your conversations with clicking noises, freezes up and makes text messaging a nightmare. The nicestest thing about this phone is the speaker phone, works great from a distance even, that is . . . on the rare occassion you get a clear signal. Don't waste your money with NEXTEL or on the i730."
1,Terrible Phone,After many years with Nextel and using their previous Motorola models. I expected alot out of this phone. I was very dissapointed. The phone itself like most newer Motorolas these days is poorly designed and cheaply constructed. It just feels cheap and flimsy. The screen while a nice size is grainy and looks terrible. I had problems with it turning on and off by itself and it does not hold a charge very long. My phone also placed itself in Airplane mode at 3 A.M one morning(waking me up) and started doing some very strange things.Pros-NoneCons-Poor build quality-Blurry Screen-Terrible Reception
2,Bigger than what I thought it would be,Folks this phone is nothing like the new range of samsung flip phones in the market. It is very chunky and looks lot like a old discountinued model. Only good thing about the phone is loud speaker phone. I bought it but after playing with it for a day I am returning the phone and I think I would settle for a samsung. The LCD screen is not as sharp and bright as the samsung as well. Make sure you see it physically before buying so that it saves your time shipping it back.
1,not worth the money,"when i first recieved this phone i had no problems with it. however after having it now for 4 months its nothing but crap. calls get dropped just sitting at my desk. loss signal in area's that i normally have great recpetion, and the cover constantly flips open when its attached to my hip. the biggest agravation is when i am in the middle of a call the call gets dropped and theres an error message on the screen. In addition the back cover is a cheep piece of metal, instead of plastic which it should me. i have sence invested in the i530 and love it."
4,Great Phone,"I have had this phone for 2 years and have had no major problems with it. The only drawback I have found is that the screen can get scratched up pretty easily even when the clam shell is closed. Great phone, I would recommend it."
4,"Slim, feature packed and GPS Navigation","This is Nextel's slickets phones. It fits in your pocket (finally), has a great color screen and 600 contacts.Also it comes with TELENAV GPS which beats any in-car GPS navigation system. It talks to you over the speakerphone and tells you when to turn. It also has maps, yellow pages and a lot more.I just wish that the battery life was a bit longer."
4,From Sprint to Nextel,"Having moved to a new location where my Sprint service was useless, I tried the Nextel i730 by Motorola. The results were much better than I expected, plus the fact that I got a phone that will hold 600 contacts. While the phone is a little larger and heavier than my former Samsung, it is not a problem, at least for me. I am well satisfied with the i730 and would recommend it to anyone."
1,Worse phone I have ever owned,"Do not buy this phone if you are thinking about it. I have had this phone for less than a year and the antenna has broken 3 times, calls are dropped at random, now the phone will not call out or let calls come in, and this is the worse phone I have ever owned."
3,No Alarm Clock,"This phone is pretty nice to look at, and has a bunch of cool features...except one of the most useful to me - an alarm clock. This feature isn't available for this phone - even from iDen."
1,BE CAREFUL-BE SURE YOU READ BEFORE PURCHASING,"I purchased a used Nextel i730 under the assumption that if I owned my own phone, I wouldn't be locked into any sort of contract with Nextel. I WAS WRONG!!! Whether they give a free phone for signing the contract, or you pay cash for a used phone, YOU MUST SIGN NEXTEL'S CONTRACT!!! NEXTEL WOULD NOT LET ME ACTIVATE A PHONE I OWNED OUTRIGHT WITHOUT A ONE YEAR CONTRACT!!! Looking back, I would have never paid cash for the phone. There are hundreds of internet cell companies that will give this and almost all phones available for free if you sign for the alotted contract term. NEXTEL TOLD ME THEY WILL NEVER ACTIVATE ANY PHONE WITHOUT A MINIMUM ONE YEAR CONTRACT!!!"
4,"Execelent Phone, Good Features & Good Coverage","I Recently purchased this phone and service. Overall i am very impressed. great features. I have no problems with coverage, It is at least 5 times better than my AT&T (TDMA/Digital) Coverage was. My only gripe is that the GPS is abit finiky (dosent always get a good fix, takes time) and there is no outright alarm clock, although the datbook 'workaround' makes up for it.The iDEN network is awesome, it is extremely fast; for example, an IM sent from my phone reaches the computer within 2 seconds, no lie!If you like a feature filled phone, and great service, I would make this the phone to get."
2,Too good to be true.,"This phone is too good to be true. It has a lot of good features. But every phone has some kind of flaw. This phone has a mega flaw in reception. I can't get a good singal. Even in metro Tucson it's kinda hard. It's an awesome phone, with bad service. Don't get me wrong. Nextel is good, just not their reception."
1,Just Terrible,"I switched over to Nextel from Sprint and purchased this phone. After the first month, I began having problems with having ""no service"" and with the phone redialing when trying to place calls. In addition, I was unable to hear through the earpiece when talking on Direct Connect using private. Those i95, i90, i88, and i60 owners, do not upgrade to this model. It is a waste of money."
4,What is this??,This is suppose to be a review of the phone NOT NEXTEL SERVICE!!! I was looking on here for advise on this phone and I got sick of the Complaints about nextel!! stick to the subject people.. and try to help people out
2,Back to the 45 RPM,"The sound quality of this CD is terrible! It is full of distortion.I had hoped to find the track ""More Shame"", wich is the intrumental flip-side of ""Shame, Shame, Shame"", on this CD. Instead I got an instrumental version wich sounds like a little kid who is experimenting with his new Casio!!!So it is back to my 45 RPM again!!!"
5,Sylvia - Pillow Talk...,"Sylvia Robinson was fairly ""ahead of her time"" with the Sensuous Sounds that I grew up with in the Seventies. An Honest-to-Goodness, true R&B; & Soul artist. The standouts for me on this collection are, or course ""Pillow Talk"" and ""My Thing."" A little too risque at the time of it's release, both these songs found their way to AM Radio in 1973.""Pillow Talk"" in particular ruled the airwaves for several weeks (#1 R&B;) and made the top five (number three) on the Pop Charts and deposited a gold record in Mrs. Robinson's pocket! I have the original vinyl somewhere. Unlike the vinyl, the extra cuts on this collection are:10. Next Time That I See You11. Gimme a Little Action12. If You Get the NotionHonest Soul and R&B; from the seventies are right here to be found! Or, rediscovered!.Come and get it!I rate Sylvia Robinson and Pillow Talk: 5 stars!"
2,Writing in student book,"There were several places in the student workbook that had answers written in ink. It was not on the sellers list that there was writing in the workbook.I will be very leary of ever buying workbooks of any kind listed thru Amazon.I was notified that i could send the workbook back for credit, but for $3.95....I've learned my lesson and it didn't cost that much! Thankfully!!!I will continue to purchase 'new' products thru Amazon and realize it's not your fault or problem....."
1,I must be a sucker to buy Disney software!!,"My very bright 5 year old was bored after the first 30 minutes. The games are not much fun, and my son was very disappointed."
1,"Didn't install right, the games aren't very fun","This did not install on my kids' computer, which is Win98, and only installed on my work computer (not great). Of course, I had already opened it, so returning it wasn't worth the possible hassle. At any rate, I thought the games were not imaginative and the navigation was poor, so it was tough for my kids to get around and figure out where the games even were. Plus, the skill level required for the different ""sub-games"" is pretty divergent."
2,Save your money and buy a bag of popcorn at Walmart,"We do not recommend this popcorn- very tough popcorn and many unpopped kernels. The best was the yellow. The white, red, and blue were bad. I thought it was because we were popping it the ""old-fashioned"" way (we used a pot on the stove) but then I went to Walmart and bought a bag of popcorn for under a dollar, a lb I think and that stuff popped well, few unpopped, and easy to chew. Great gift idea that did not satisfy. Even microwave Pop Secret was 100 times better and I am not a fan of microwave popcorn. I give it two stars because the bowl was nice. But not worth over twenty bucks."
1,Cheap POS.,"I bought this watch for my wife, who is a traveling nurse and wanted a timepiece that would fit her on-the-go lifestyle. I thought this unique type of watch, which was easily removed and put back on, would be ideal for someone who was constantly washing their hands and taking off their watch to do it.Instead, the glass face of the watch fell off within a couple of weeks of use (not abuse, mind you) the wristband arms were easily cracked, and the watch itself didn't seem particularly resistant to sweat and other moisture (despite being advertised as an athletic watch that would presumably be worn by a sweating athlete)I'm surprised Nike put their name on this piece of water buffalo turd. However, I guess for $45 you shouldn't expect too much out of a watch."
2,used product sold as new,"Ordered as a Christmas present, didn't open shippment until I was ready to wrap. Watch has no instructions for setting time or using functions, time was set (to a different time zone) and it looks like it has been in and out of the box several times. I will not buy from this supplier again."
2,Delay,"This item was a gift. When ordered, the item was listed as, ""in stock"". The item was delayed at least once. I will not order any products from this vendor in the future."
5,Norpro Compost keeper,"I love my compost keeper! It is a good size for 3-4 adults that cook alot. The filter in the lid really works at keeping odors contained. It cleans up well and fits nicely under the sink. I have not tried the plastic liners...as we just dump it into our compost pile. My daughter calls it ""Oscar's house""."
5,Beginning Composter,"Good construction and excellent odor control (though I agree you should empty it into your compost bin at least once a week, to avoid bad odors when you take off the lid). I took the tip of another user and put used plastic vegetable bags from the grocery store to line the container--which makes it very easy to keep clean."
5,Norpro Stainless steel compost Keeper,"I love this compost keeper. I make a trip to the garden compost pile every other day. The Stainless steel is heavy enough and the lid fits snug. no smells at all. The small bucket I used before was adequate, but the smell and the bugs it attracted was not nice. No more smell or bugs with this compost keeper. Love it and highly recommend it. It will be on my Christmas list this year to give."
1,composter bank,"bought because of good reviews, the one I received was very poor. It was impossible to open, secure like a bank vault. It almost takes two people to open it. I returned it for a refund."
5,I like it!,"It's lightweight, easy to clean and looks nice on the counter. Nice ""stop over"" for scraps on their way out to the compost!"
2,HUH?,"$40 (on sale) for a container that comes with holes in the lid, designed specifically so you have to keep buying charcoal filters forever. Does that really make sense?Spend $15 for a stainless steel cannister (or less for a plastic one) with a sealing lid. It will last for decades and--what a concept!--seals odors in for free. (Okay, it won't have that cute little bail handle. Isn't $25 a bit steep for a cute little handle?)If it smells, EMPTY IT!"
2,Ok i Guess...,I own this compost Keeper and thats just what it is. it does NOT compost your scrap it merly holds it until you transport it to the compost pile. the odor elimenator charcole pads were very un-helpful because they did there job so well. you never know when mold is starting to form in there ( Which is regularly). this product is a waste of 60 dollars and could be easily substituted with a bucket.
4,Better than my previous two,"Previously, I have had two ceramic composters; the handle broke off the first, and the second one cracked and broke over time. That will not happen with this one. The size is also more convenient for dumping coffee grounds without spilling. It's a little difficult to pull the top off, but that helps with odors."
4,compost pail,"It looks nice on the countertop,even though the green biodegradable bag ovelaps the top by about 3 inches. Its great for throwing scraps in when I'm preparing a meal and the filter eliminates the smell."
5,Pretty and functional,"This product stores kitchen scraps without smelling up your kitchen. It's pretty and sturdy. I was very surprised that I couldn't smell ANYTHING because of the holes in the lid, but they seem to help it decompose. I only cook for two, so it takes awhile to fill it. During that time, my pile of compost inside it actually shrank! It's a good product! I haven't found any flaws thus far!"
1,Faulty lid,"Initially this product was great. The lid fit snug, but was still easy to remove. The filters worked and there were not any flies as reported in some posts. The stainless steel cleans up nicely. Unfortunately within the first year the metal band on the lid split vertically. Now we find we don't use it as much because the lid is difficult to get on and off. Another split has appeared recently. I have to give this product 1 star because it was not durable. For this price it should have lasted for a few years."
4,"Cute, retro look!","This little guy works much better then the bread bags that I used to reuse! The finish matches all my appliances in my kitchen and the retro mini-garbage-can-look fits in with my collectable kitsch. It wipes down well. My only complaint is I wish it was bigger. And the charcol filter works sooo well, that when you lift the lid to add another compost item, ohhh man, does your nose get knocked out!"
5,counter top compost can,"Excellent product. Has eliminated the gnats and other bugs that abounded when we did not have this item. Easy to keep clean and with the filter, there is no odor."
2,Not Great.,Have been using this product for several months now and while initially it seemed like a great product it is starting to show significant wear. It says the product is stainless steel however it appear that there is rust beginning to form in locations were abrasion is typical (ie the lid). Had I know this would occur I probably would have gone with the ceramic version. Just a heads up for everyone.
5,Great compost bin!,"My husband was using a bowl for the scraps and recycleable food items...it looked awful on the counter and smelled! This container is GREAT! its a big size, so it holds a lot...and has a charcoal filter that absorbs the odor. Its just what i was looking for!"
2,Filter insert doesn't stay in lid,"I've had a similar style bucket in the past, but lost the lid due to operator error (lid accidently dumped in yard waste container). Finally ordered what I thought was the same thing we had purchased from Bed, Bath, and Beyond, but this container has a problem with filter insert staying in the lid. Put the insert into the top cover and it slides right out into the waste in the can. We eventually taped the insert in, but the tape breaks quickly and out comes the insert. I complained to the seller expecting a return label or maybe a new lid insert, but instead Uncle Jim's Worm Farm sent a whole new container. The new one works a little better, but the insert still likes to slide out, albeit more slowly than the first one. I would not recommend this container, but a big shout out to Uncle Jim's Worm Farm for attempting to fix the problem."
1,Rust Bucket,This product was a real disappointment. Within less than a week of very light use I discovered that the product was rusting. If you want a rusty bin this one is for you if not you might want to search for another brand/style of compost bucket.
2,Fruit Flies,I agree with the person who complained about the fruit flies. We loved this all winter and spring....and then fruit fly season came. We had a plastic compost bucket on our counter for years and had much less of a problem.
4,"Good quality, as described, does get flies!","Nice solid bucket, perfect size for counter, easy to keep clean. But fruit flies do get in the holes at the top, even with the charcoal filter in there. Maybe if you were careful to empty and scrub it everyday they'd stay away... not sure."
1,Fruit Fly Nest,"A word of warning- the holes in the top of the bin allow fruit flies to enter and lay eggs in the carbon material. If you are not prone to fruit flies, are not squeamish about boiling the carbon to kill them or dealing with maggots than go for it. But, I would recommend a product without the top holes or a carbon insert.I had mine for about 2-3 months before I realized what was going on. Also, some people online did not notice until they had a ton (infestation) coming out of the bin when they opened it.Ew!!!"
1,Very Poor Quality Product,"We ordered this stainless steel compost pail as a durable and attractive way to store our compost scraps, replacing the plastic pail we used. On the original unit we received the lid seam split open after only a couple of weeks and had to be returned. Our second unit has now been returned because the can/pail portion of the unit split down the seam. The unit appears attractive, but the lid is not easy to use (Friction is higher than expected). I would not recommend this composter to anyone given the poor quality we have experienced."
5,Kitchen composting,"This product looks great on my counter, it matches my stainless applicance and is a great way to collect scraps until I can get to my yard waste cart. It's a great size for a single guy or small family."
5,Still no smell after 1 year,I was looking for replacement filters after realizing that it has been 1 year (of heavy use) and I still haven't needed to replace the filters. Our family of 5 fills this up about 2 times per week but we compost just about anything we can! I have a great ComposTumbler outside that I can easily dump into from my Norpro 94 and turn 3 times. This saves at least 3 trips outside everyday to compost. My veggies this year are going to be outstanding! Worth every penny!
5,stink-free!,"I really like this thing! Since we're lazy, we don't get out to the composter as much as we should and this keeps the smells in really well!"
5,Very good product,I used these with a hardwood flooring project to hide the screw holes on the first row of flooring. It cut plugs from the pre-finished hardwood great. No chipping or gouges at all. Arrived well protected and I like the fact that it is self contained in its own wooden box to keep them organized and protected.
3,years latter its still working fine,"this microwave was bought refurbished. its been a good buy for us. we use it everyday and it has done as advertised. the only complaint is that its 1350 watts and most frozen food expects 1100 watts so we adjust suggested times as best we can, still not a big deal. the frozen food defrost inverter works ok, and a microwave from 2003 that's still working fine is a good deal by me!"
1,Defective product and dishonest customer service,"I called JVC customer service to complain about the problems I'm having with my new system. The man acted surprised when I told him not a single CD would play and the display kept reading ""no disc"". He had ""no idea what could be wrong with it"", indicated this problem was ""isolated"" and had the nerve to ask me if I had dropped it. He then advised to unplug the system and wait before trying it again.Then I looked on Amazon and saw how many similar complaints have been made by others. Obviously, this is an ongoing problem which requires replacement of defective parts. The least customer service could have done was to be honest and acknowledge this defect. I'm very disappointed in JVC and will not be purchasing other products from this company."
1,Is there a zero stars?,"This is the worst thing I have ever owned!!!! It broke (said there were no cd's inside) after about a week! Do yourself a favor don't get this product, don't buy this brand and don't buy from sears they sucked about the whole thing too."
2,Nice look and sound but unreliable,"As others have said, our unit also broke (after 7 months). It could not read the CDs - the usual problem with this product. A JVC repair centre fixed it and we have it back working. The repair took around one month."
4,Wait!!!,"The CD trays are a little flimsy, but this audio system really packs a whollop. The sound is excellent. For the price, it has a lot of features, such as Bass/Treble control, a sleep timer, and five CD trays. To get an enjoyable sound, I'm willing to take the risk that a tray may break. I just try to be extra gentle with the trays."
1,Same problem - CD player dead,"I guess I was among the ""lucky"" ones, since I had this unit for more than 2 years before it dies. As many other people has experienced,the CD player died also died. Had problem from the start with the flimsy CD player, but it was bearable -- it was saying ""read"" for kind of a long time before playing CD"", now it only says ""READ"" and doesn't play no more, and cannot even eject the CDs!Should not have fall for the nice wood look of this system. My bad for not having searched for reviews before buying.It's a shame, such nice sound and such bad quality. I'll never buy JVC products anymore."
2,CHEAP,I had this for 6 days and very randomly it kept saying that there was no disk in the player. The sound is awesome but the cd changer is VERY flimsy and could break very easily but what I am most upset about is that the player won't play any of my cd's what so ever burnt or not.
1,JVC used to be reliable - not any more :(,"Pros: it's prettyCons: it's garbageSure wished I had checked here at Amazaon before I bought this - I can't believe JVC put out such garbage! So many of these CD players have broken that they can't keep up with the replacement parts (5 week wait?!!)I guess I was one of the luckier ones - mine lasted almost 2 months before it died.Bottom line: if you haven't bought yet, look elsewhere. If you have, keep your receipt and warranty handy..."
1,Sent it back,"I had to send this item back because it stopped playing cds. The sound quality was good, but the dependability of this item is questionable."
5,Good Collection,"Trinity and beyond Is the best part of this three dvd set, I have seen it before, The other two are good documenteries also."
2,Half the book deals with cooking instead of raw food.,"Although the cover is filled with photos of raw fruits and vegetables, and the title is ""Dining in the RAW"" with the word ""RAW"" capitalized, the book is not a compendium of exclusively raw food recipes. Nearly half the book describes cooked foods. For those who have adopted a raw diet, half this book is irrelevant."
2,NOT for people transitioning to raw food..here's why,"Most of the raw recipes have about 5 ingredients, 1 of which is almost always Braggs Liquid Aminos. I've tried to like Braggs for seven years now and I just can't. It's nasty. The seasoned 100 percent raw fooder may find these palatable but to a newbie, most of the recipes will be bland AT BEST, gag worthy at worst. Like others say, there are a significant amount of cooked recipes in the book(the ones with tempeh are actually pretty good, if you're into that) so I'd say overall this is more of a macro-biotic cookbook than a raw one. I haven't used it in five years but now that I've been a raw foodist for two months, some of the recipes I wouldn't even have considered before may appeal to me. For a transitioning raw foodie, I really reccommend Jennifer Cornbleet's Raw Food Made Easy for 1 or 2 people."
5,Best Cook Book for Healthy Eating,"I know that this cook book is absolutely the best I have ever used for raw and vegatarian cuisine. I have taken quite a few of Ms. Romano's cooking classes in Key West, FL and this cook book has all of those recipes and much more. The delicious and easy to follow step by step recipes make this book a MUST HAVE for anyone looking to lead a healthier lifestyle. I recommend this as a gift for anyone to give to someone they know who enjoys great tasting food - even if they are not a vegetarian. It has everything from salads and appetizers to the most luscious desserts. When you buy this book buy 2 - one for yourself and one for someone else. They will thank you for it again and again - I am positive."
2,Not Raw Vegan,Be careful with this book... if you're looking for a book with just raw recipes this isn't a good choice. There are many cooked recipes in this book. If you are simply looking for a healthy cookbook with some raw recipes this may be a good choice for you.
2,Could've been 4 stars...,"I agree with the other reviewer. The title is just too misleading. Half the recipes are cooked, thereby destroying all the valuable enzymes. A Raw foods book should contain all raw recipes. Maybe she should've called it ""Dining with Rita"". If all the recipes were raw, then I would've given this book 4 stars."
1,No Support - Buyer Beware!,"Beware! If you change your password from the one assigned when you buy and install the software, you may not be able to log into the BigOven web site. Without access to the website, the software's functionality is reduced considerably. For example, you won't get access to a vast majority of the recipes the software touts. I spent hours trying to get the website to accept the password that BigOven keeps sending to me, but it doesn't work. I tried deleting cookies and temporary files, as suggested by BigOven's inadequate, canned Q&A; support -- but still no success logging in. I have emailed thier support address three times but there has been no response. I recently emailed requesting a refund -- but no surprise -- they have not responded....just another software developer ready to take your money but not back up their product!"
5,Great way to store recipes with out the paper clutter!,"I think BigOven is a great program for storing and sorting all my favorite recipes. It lives up to its claims.I also read the review of BigOven that wanted shopping lists and menus all ready for shopping, and I think the program they are looking for can be found at savingdinner.com. They send out 6 dinner recipes, along with a corresponding categorized shopping list. One Menu Mailer even gives you all that plus Breakfast, Snacks and Lunch, called the Body Clutter Menu Mailer. You can also find a book at your library or here on Amazon called Saving Dinner, and it's the same thing, and you can even print the shopping lists from online as well.Should you decide to do Menu Mailer, please tell them that I sent you. My email address is flymommy@gmail.com.I hope you find this helpful. Good luck in the kitchen!"
5,Superb photography collection worthy of the legend himself,"This is a book with and about the power of photos that document the life of this iconic, multi-talented, elegant and stylish man, and -needless to say- an incomparable legend of cinema. Newman was a man always beautiful inside and out. The legend's examplary life was epic, and this book, which manages to capture many details and moments of it brilliantly, matches him in quality, poise and dignity. It is basically a well-executed photography book, so what you will receive is a chic collection of big and high quality photos... generally carrying a candid and off-the-cuff feeling that enriches the value and intimacy of the viewing experience.I will not write a long review, since there are many very eloquent ones here already: I just wanted to rate the book with a well-deserved grade of 5 stars. This should be a precious item for all the Newman fans out there."
5,Thrilled with my purchase.,"This is a gift for my mother, a HUGE Newman fan, who will, no doubt, be sequestered after she receives it ;). Great condition and arrived promptly. Thanks!"
3,Blood of Ten Chiefs,This book is not a graphic novel. There are no illustrations. Only the introduction and first chapter is by Richard Pini. The remaining chapters are all written by a variety of different authors. I was hoping for the artwork of Wendy Pini.
2,did not work,"so far after a month there has been no change with this product, though i have not experienced the rash that others have talked about, i have not seen the changes that others have talked about."
1,doesnt really work,"I tried this for 4 months with no results so stopped using it for a month. I then got approved for HRT and developed breasts within 3 weeks. So if you are wanting to transition, do it the right way. Most doctors have a payment price, and truth be told, the most expensive thing is electrolysis aside from bottom surgery. What do you expect from a product that classifies ""crossdressing, transgender, and transvestite men"" all the same thing when clearly they are not."
2,im not sure if this works,Took it for a week and a half felt no changes in mood or breast/nipples maybe I have to double up idk but I stopped using this product
4,Gasping for more!,"I picked up this book at the recommendation of a Chapters salesperson in Vancouver on a recent trip. Started reading it on the plane on the way home. I enjoyed the Vancouver references since I'd just visited a few of these places. It even referenced blueberry tea which I ordered once thinking I was actually getting blueberry tea!This book had a lot of characters which I sometimes had trouble keeping straight, but which I wanted to know more about. The book could have been longer, with more development of the characters. But I was instantly grabbed by Jackson Cole, and desperately hope Ms. Smith includes him as the main character in a series. I loved the pace of the novel and the tension it created. I was left wanting the story to go on, and will look for the sequel. I do fear, though, that my memories of Vancouver will now be influenced by this book . . . was Jackson Cole someone I met on my trip, . . . or not?"
5,This book answers the number one question every seller has.,"As an author, teacher and eBay powerseller myself, the question ""What sells on eBay and where can I find it"" is the single most asked question I get from my readers. Chris and Lisa's book, cuts right to the heart of the problem and leads you step by step to the right answer for you.No fluff --no worthless wholesale lists just ""the right stuff."" Chris is the leading expert and the most trusted voice on wholesale sourcing in the eBay community and Lissa is an expereieced eBay power seller and respected eBay trainer. This book is a bargain at twice the price.Harry (Skip) McGrath, editor, The eBay Seller's News"
1,Oh Thank you!!,"Thank you so much for taking the time to write these reviews, I was about to purchase ! Thanks for saving my money!!"
2,Below a much better book to save your time and money,How to Start and Run an eBay Consignment Businessby Skip McGrath
1,What to sell on e-bay,Just stupid I can believe it how they can take you money that way. Un libro estupido sin ningun tipo de informacion. Latinos no compren este libro. Es una trampa no hay aqui. Ninguna informacion valida.
2,No Details,"This book is a huge disappointment. After reading it through, I am no closer to knowing what to sell or how to source it. No wholesale sources or manufacturers are listed.The book DOES give a good explanation for how to evaluate what sells on eBay & whether a market is saturated. Otherwise, there's nothing but general information here."
3,202 things you can buy & sell for big profits,"This book is not as good as expected ! A few good pointers but very dissapointed ! Yes I did read the whole book too !!""202 things you can buy & sell for big profits"" , NOW that was absolutely worth paying for ! A++++++"
1,Another $$ Black Hole,"Don't bother, folks...it's another one of those ""how to do it"" books that offer a compendium of vague principles and ""ideas"" that you can find all over the web in free articles, a million other books (some of which you probably already own), with some plugs for the authors' sites thrown in. There's absolutely nothing more here.(As an aside, one of the authors' sites violates several very basic and well-known marketing principles, so we might question her expertise, and it gives a ""suite number"" in the mailing address, which appears to be a mailbox rental place when you Google the street address. If so, ""box number"" would be a bit more straight-up, no?)...and take the good reviews with a grain of salt. I suspect many were written by folks with an agenda of one kind or another. I don't find any agendas in the negative reviews, however, as none of them that I've read are selling an alternative. I wish they were!"
3,Informative Book,This was a great book to get your mind started on thinking about opening a retail business. It doesn't focus solely on EBay. It also covers other small business avenues.The only thing I didn't like about the book was that it was a bit too broad or vague on some areas. It could have been more specific in certain areas.
1,If I could score this book - star I would,"What a scam!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It's so frustrating.At the time I purchased this book there were not many reviews, thank God I bought it used because it was a total waste. They did explain the different vendor types that you can use, the synopsis was this-the wholesalers are not looking for your business because you do not have a big enough business/order, but if you are lucky enough to find a legitimate wholesaler they will most likely work with you. I do not have a replacement for this book, but I know if you haven't purchased this book already don't waste your money its a SCAM!"
3,Excellent Book,Great book. It was intended as a gift. Thought it was a hardback. I had already read the book so I returned it.
3,Maxtor Shared storage,"I found this product easy to install, however it didn't install correctly on all home networked computers. Came up with cannot find network path. With some knowledge of networking, I am still able to create folders and use it, however all users in my family cannot simply click and save data to this hardrive. I have to create the path for them.Everything else good.Rick"
1,"Like other users, product was dead on arrival.","Having had few problems with Maxtor in the past, I purchased this unit for back-up purposes to accomodate the larger hard drive in my new PC. Yes, the new PC uses Vista Ultimate, but do not be so quick to blame Vista.Nothing I did would enable this drive to be seen, whether it be a Vista or an XP machine. As a further test, to give the unit a benefit of the old doubt, I handed the unit over to a well-experienced friend in the hardware field. He suggested I use it for a doorstop or a boat anchor; he could not get it to work either.Return the unit? Sure, if you want the added insult of having to pay for the return yourself. Customer service, I found, is long gone at Maxtor.Save your money. Look elsewhere. Anyplace but Maxtor."
3,rather disappointing...,"Amazon delivered but Maxtor didn't. The ethernet drive seems to work ok but the software is really outdated and sub-standard. I have un-installed it since it really doesn't do much and it puts an obtrusive icon in the sys tray that is hard to delete. The XP backup software seems to be much better than the Maxtor software and that's not saying much. It's noisier than I hoped and if you turn it off, you have to use the browser interface to get it so the computers on the network can ""see"" again, everytime.I wish, just once, the product description would accurately portray the real situation instead of some idealized situation. It does operate though and store files.Would I buy it again? Probably not but I'm not going to return it, that would be a real hassle."
1,Buy something else!,"1. Printer Caching Problem - This was my main issue. The main attraction to this drive was the ability to replace my printer server, however when I tried to print a 4.5 MB picture it would not print. After some research I discovered that the device has a serious flaw in its printer caching which doesn't allow it to handle large print job (5+ pages). So in order to print a 20 page doc you have to do it 5 pages at a time! I don't have time for that.2. MAC Software is Garbage - So the MAC software on this is so horrible! It doesn't work well at all.3. Overall Admin Horrible - The overall admin does not work well for deleting and creating accounts. As you will see the drive needs to be formatted. I did all I could to delete my accounts, and while you can't access them I can't get rid of them either. There was no documentation on how to format the drive!4. Media Server Never Worked - That's self explanatory. Maxtor needs to put this one back on the shelf."
3,"Fast Drive, Fairly Dependable, but AWFUL Software","We purchased this to back up our 3 computers at work. Drive and software installed pretty easily, though the software set up is a bit confusing, unnecessarily. Unfortunately, within a couple of hours, the drive developed a ""boot error."" Technical support was excellent, but it was quickly determined that the drive was defective and needed to be replaced. Setting up the replacement drive involved uninstalling and reinstalling the software. The software continually reports failed backups and a nebulous ""internal error 2"" on 2 of our machines. It seems that it does not really accept one's changes to the backup settings without a manual deletion of the configuration file (see Seagate forum). I am happy with the quietness and speed of the drive, but plan on finding better backup software. Seagate could have been (and still has the opportunity to be) more generous with decent backup software, since this is the main purpose of the device!"
2,Panamax Max 2 Tel phone protection poor,"The phone portion of this suppressor does NOT automatically reset so the first time it takes a surge, the unit is toast. I don't recommend this unit for phone protection."
2,Very abbreviated survey text.,"My main disappointment with this book is that ""Art of Tibet"" really turns out to mean ""Buddhist Art of Tibet"". Perhaps one page is spent addressing the art and culture of Tibet prior to the introduction of Buddhism. This is a very brief survey book good to have as a reference for the most well-known pieces but not able to stand alone if you need more detail. I would recommend it as an introductory book, and advise seeking others if the topic interests you."
4,Fragrant!,"Very tasty. I particularly enjoy the unique, spicy/flowery aroma of this honey with my yogurt."
1,Does not live up to its name,"This book didn't teach me any new or exciting aspects of the C language. The title suggests that this book is going to let the dog of the leash and go wild with the C language but no. The content focuses on the latest C9X standards alot and displays some examples of nice algorithms that have been thought up before by someone else. Great is your a 'strictly by the rules' programmer, but its not for me. There are many good things that can be done in C programming which are non compliant with the C9X standards, particularly inter-system processes, and these are the kind of things I would like to see published in a book of this sort.? It's a pretty basic book which whines on about standards too much and nothing like the title makes out. It focuses on what you can or can't do within the rules of the C9X standards and its quite amusing that the title contradicts the contents of the book. Another one for the charity shop."
1,Would not recommend it.,I found this book to be very poorly written and unsatisfactory. It contained lots of bad algorithms and poor coding. Much of the code was unusable and the methods explained were very simple. I could have done without it to be honest. Avoid this book if you want to learn how to program properly
1,Don't waste your time or $,"Not only is the quality of this DVD horrible, many of the facts it teaches are very outdated, or simply flat-out wrong."
2,Large but shoots flames,"The large capacity of this microwave is wonderful for my family. Unfortunately after having the microwave for less than 7 months it is shooting flames out the back grill from an electrical problem. I called panasonic to get it repaired but the closest repair shops are in Houston & Conroe, TX (approximately 100 miles away). Of course I could ship it to them at my expense for repair. To get electronic repair you must have your receipt that you bought it. A credit card statement wont work. My last microwave lasted 14 years."
1,"Once a good oven, now a paperweight","Like other reviewers, I enjoyed about a year of service from this powerful, sleek-looking microwave before it bit the dust. With no warning, it started shutting off after about 10 seconds of cooking. The old GE it replaced survived 15 years and 3 moves with no trouble. I'm disappointed a fine brand like Panasonic would put its name on an unreliable product like this."
1,A piece of garbage which looks nice,"We bought this microwave 2 1/2 years ago because it was beautiful and had lots of great features. After 2 1/2 years of extremely light wear, I was nuking cat food today -- for 12 seconds -- and the thing died. Flat out died. I called Panasonic (as did R. Tracy below) and they hadn't heard of any problems with this unit -- when clearly, that's a bunch of hooey. I have given them a piece of my mind -- like the fact that my first microwave (which was a Panasonic too) lasted a gazillion years and we had to get rid of it because it was probably leaking microwaves by then. (It also weighed about 100 pounds!) The bottom line is that I'm writing a letter to the president of Panasonic and telling the big honcho what a piece of garbage this unit is, that not advising the customer service people who have to deal with people like me that there's a problem with the unit is disingenuous and that I'll never buy another Panasonic product ever again."
2,"Great defroster, but mine died too","I purchased this microwave 14 months ago from Amazon; it's seen light duty since, and it worked quite well. But one night a couple weeks ago, it died in the middle of a cooking cycle--no lights, no control panel, no action. The credit card I purchased it with will extend the warranty, but it's really not worth the effort to fix a $125 product. I hate to relegate it to a landfill, but apparently, it was made to be disposable. The Panasonic I owned before this lasted 12 years (and longer--I got rid of it because I wanted something fancier--this model)."
1,Electrical Fault,"Ordered this item and it arrived in a damaged box, the microwave door did not close properly and had a dent in the metal. Sent it back and was rapidly dispatch a replacement... the replacement had some electrical fault and was not able to cook any food, the packaging looked as if some other person returned it and it was simply re-shipped out. I have just returned this item and am hoping that I am 3rd time lucky. Amazon were great with the returns part, shame the items were defective."
5,A must read for all ages!,"Dealing with the history of the Space Shuttle, Ms. Cross has put together one of the best books available for children of all ages and, their parents as well. If you have even a remote interest in Space and Space Exploration this is the book for you. The pictures she has published, pulled directly from the NASA archives, are simply stunning. The story she weaves from the Shuttles beginning, through its long history of flight, and remarkable sucesses is well written and a joy to share. Thanks Ms. Cross for thinking of the generation to come. May ""I Am A Space Shuttle, I LOVE TO FLY!"" be the catalyst for someone young who simply wants to see what few of us will from that perspective."
5,THIS ALBUM IS OFF THA HOOK LOCS,"tha birch street mafia have a lot of hype skillz .... an what they speak on is true and heartfelt....str8 gangbanging on this album....it has some of tha most bangin beats i've heard since above the law's ""legends"" ....if you dont have that 1 go an get it....an go get this joint ""armageddon""....its a gripping album that opens your eyes to a world where youth dwell in slums an tha everyday struggles having to be dealt with....very good cadence an flowing rhymes are syncronized with tha rhymical beats that include phonky bass lines....go an get this album u wont be disappointed"
5,Great Bible study!,I love these Quick Studies books - they are all great! They are easy to use and have questions that get the kids thinking. It's a good study for working your way through a book of the Bible and I highly recommend it!
1,it is from Israel the product,"it is from Israel the product; it had a piece of rubber broken, i`m from Guatemala, so i can not return it will be a lot of money i will lost"
4,Good product,We use this to help our grandson maintain weight gain. He likes it so it's easy to use. He prefers the chocolate!
1,Pediasure uses #7 Plastic,"I have been giving my daughter Pediasure and it was helping her gain some weight plus she loved the taste too. However, I just found out that the plastic bottles that they come in are #7 which is contaminated with a chemical called Bisphenol A or more commonly known as BPA. Do a google on this chemical. Most baby companies that make bottles like Avent and Dr Brown's have recently begun using plastics that do not have BPA because of the dangers associated with it especially in young children. Shame on Pediasure for not taking the initiative to protect our children. I am going to start making smoothies for my daughter instead."
5,Mushrooms Galore!,"This is a great book, and at no. 137,000 this Bob Harris' book on Mushrooms seems all set to pass the other Bob Harris' book on Chomskian analysis of how dumb all those journalists are, excepting of course Mssrs. Cohen and Solomon."
2,"Maybe not pure trash, but....","I won't go that far, because it takes a lot to be able to write a good story; one that is believeable and engaging. However, since we are talking about horror, toss out the believeability factor. This story wasn't even engaging enough to keep my attention for long, although I did finish it. Any time you spend money on a book, you have a duty to finish it.This was like going to the dentist, though. It was literally like pulling teeth to finish this zombie tale about the living dead in downtown Dallas.Even more surprising was that the folks at Dell Abyss would publish this. The Abyss line put out some good little horror novels, like the Stephen King blurb said. However, this wasn't one of them.If you want to read a DECENT novel from Dee, try SUCCUMB. It's not Shakespeare and the premise is not new, but Dee writes a good little yarn about being careful for what you wish for. It's light year's better than this novel."
1,"Cheap thrills, pure trash.","A shallow, virtually storyless novel about vampires ravaging Dallas. The book pads out to 369 tortuous pages with what could have just about made a short story. I confess to having skimmed the last 50 or so because I just couldn't take it anymore. Not only was the lethargic pace a killer, but Dee's writing is plain lousy. I found the prose insulting to my intelligence, to say the least, and he loads it with profanity like a teenager saying ""look what I can write!"" I find it amazing that this title ever got published, let alone by Dell Abyss. It doesn't even rate as beach reading."
2,So-so,"My 5 year old daughter started asking questions about how babies are made. I bought this book hoping it would answer the questions that were difficult for me to try and answer. I didn't really think this book did a very good job. There's too much going on on each page, that it was confusing. And it didn't really answer her questions very well."
4,Very Informational,"I thought that this book provided very good insight to a question, that is often raised by children at a young age. This book answered many questions regarding where babies do come from. Most pre-school children think that they come from mommy's stomach. I would reccommend this book for early-childhood educators,as well as parents of young children who are expecting again."
4,Awesome Puzzle,"The puzzle itself is beautiful. However, the quality is what sets it apart. The pieces are sturdy and fit together perfectly. It's challenging and fun."
4,Quality challenge,"This is a good quality, challenging puzzle. You have to pay very close attention when completing the greenery as the images on the individual pieces can appear blurry and therefore difficult to match, but naturally fit when you find the right spot for them. This in my 2nd Ravensburger and they definitely outdo any other puzzles I've come bought by way of quality."
5,Flanagan at his best.,"This recording of his 1988 LP Nights at the Vanguard includes previously unreleased songs including Mark One, More Than You Know, and I'll Keep Loving You. Accompanying Flanagan is bassist George Mraz and drummer Al Foster. You'll hear Flanagan at his lyrical best, stringing together soft and mellifluous phrases through these tunes. Cued to precision, Flanagan's interaction with Mraz and Foster grasp the pathos of Flanagan's arrangements which distinguishes his style from others. Flanagan at his best."
1,Another dead end,I'm on my second bottle of Artichoke extract and haven't seen or noticed any kind of effect from them. Not impressed. Probably won't order again.
1,Not a cholesterol zapper,While researching different products to reduce cholesterol naturally I read a few articles about artichoke. This seemed to be a wonder drug. I had been taking statins to lower my hereditary high cholesterol for years. After stopping my statins and taking the recommended dose of artichoke capsules for 4 months I had a blood test to check the results. My cholesterol had soared to 465! Needless to say I am back on statins. The service however was excellent. I recieved my order quickly.

3,Too moderate for me,"Having read ""Home Buying for Dummies"" by Eric Tyson and Ray Brown which I highly recommend (with five stars) to all the home seekers, now I understand why I'm not really happy with this book. I find this ""Idiot's Guide"" approach too moderate, lacking in-depth analyses or comments in many areas. (e.g. how to spot ideal locations, etc. ) The author, in my view, doesn't take a stand and states her opinion clearly enough, which sometimes makes me feel like I am reading a free government brochure on home buying A to Z. Perhaps one single volume is not enough to cover such vast and complicated areas as buying and selling homes.Although I will keep this book and use it as a reference/glossary when necessary, I'd probably rely on Tyson/Brown's book for ""tips"" most of the time."
2,Not bad... but not great.,"I bought both this book and ""Home Buying for Dummies,"" and honestly I think I got one piece of useful information out of this book. Once I started reading the other book, I couldn't set it down. It was such an easy read and everything was easy to understand. Again, this book isn't bad, but it wasn't the right book for me."
5,A Susinct Guide for Home Buying,"This book was an excellent resource for the first time home buyer. It guided me through the very beginning stages all the way to close. At times it was a bit simplistic, however, for first time buyers, that simplicity is duly warranted. I especially appreciated the definitions in the back explaining the various jargon used in the real estate industry."
1,Emperor's New Groove -- doesn't,"Be prepared for major disappointment from the user when the sound doesn't work. My system more than meets the requirments but the sound remains untentably garbled even after 4 hours of working on the problem. The manual gives a URL for troubleshooting that has been re-routed and you have to quess which icon leads to customer support. Drivers have been updated, FAQ's read, manual consulted, etc. The result: no Groove and no fun!"
5,Beautiful book,"Book was gorgeous and children loved the pictures. I am working on going ""green"" in my classroom. Books like this one help children to appreciate our planet!"
5,Great,Product is in great condition. Arrived well. We have loved listening to this. Songs include movie score and songs. My two year old sings along with it. Thank you!
3,Not so good Disney!,"I think that this soundtrack is not very good. Mr. Menken didn't do it as good as in Beauty and The Beast, Aladdin and Pocahontas. The only good part of the music is when the muses sing. They should've let Ricky Martin sing the English version of ""Go the distance"" too (look what he did with ""The Cup of Life"" of the Soccer World Cup). His Spanish version is far better than Michael Bolton's. At least this soundtrack is better than Hunchback."
5,The last thing you will ever need to try!,"There is a history of Heartburn, GERD, etc in our family. We are pretty susceptible to it. I have suffered for many years from this. I did my research, tried different Aloe Vera drinks and although they helped a little...not as nearly as much as this stuff! One cap full in the morning, and one cap full at night...I went through 2 bottles and didn't have an issue at all again until i got pregnant! AMAZING and worth the try. Incredibly affordable. The taste could leave some to be desired but you only need to drink a cap full...hardly anything to really whine about right? The results are worth it. Do yourself a favor and get this stuff...then work on fixing your diet...Go to Iherb.com for more reviews. I love going here for reviews for any herb or organic product. I don't work for them, just love them lol.[...]"
3,Simply O.K.,"Pros: Very easy to install. Not too bulky, so it won't interfere with any other devices. Its made of clear plastic, causing no risk of electrical short-outs. Hefty, well protected power cable. Lots of bright lights (if you're into that stuff) Quiet.Cons: Very small fans don't move as much air as desired. One of the fans spins slower than the other (sometimes it won't start up at all unless manually assisted) Lights are too flashy for my taste (seems like a circus show inside my case) There is no off switch for the lights. Inexpensive.Conclusion: For the price, it does what it says it does. I might have gotten a slightly faulty fan, but its not too bad.Lots of flashes, but no whistles."
4,A clear and simple guide to the art of being here.,"Diana St Ruth does not waste time or space trying to be clever; she comes straight to the point: What is meditation and how can it become an integral part of one's (sitting/moving) life. An excellent book for beginners and, because of this, an essential book for those who consider themselves advanced. This little book has obviously been written out of experience, thank goodness, and not regurgitation. Practical wisdom and compassion. ""Recognize the true self and the nature of this moment, and realize there is nothing to crush."""
4,Doctor Perscribed,"My doctor suggested this product, via samples, when I was undergoing chemo and it made my eyelashes fall out and caused a problem with dry eye and an infection in the eyelids. I kept using it after I recovered from cancer because it works better than drops for that gritty eye sensation from using one's eyes too much."
